A drug to treat advanced prostate cancer should be given to patients in England and Wales, according to the NHS rationing body. Abiraterone, marketed as Zytiga, can extend the lives of late-stage cancer sufferers by more than three months. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) had originally rejected the drug, which costs around £3,000 a month, for not being cost effective. It provoked an angry response from both patients and cancer charities. However, today it revised its recommendations after the manufacturer Janssen offered the tablet at a lower undisclosed price. If Nice gives final approval to the drug it will have to be offered by the NHS in England and Wales from June. However, in a reverse of the usual trend the drug won't be available in Scotland. In March the Scottish Medicines Consortium turned the drug down saying the cost of abiraterone did not justify the health benefits. This decision could change as it is still in talks with Janssen. The new draft guidance has been welcomed by experts. Owen Sharp, Chief Executive of The Prostate Cancer Charity, said: 'This announcement represents a resounding triumph for each of the thousands of men with advanced prostate cancer in England and Wales who know just how much the prospect of precious extra time with their loved ones really means. 'Although today marks a very welcome advancement, it has to be remembered that abiraterone remains out of reach to men in Scotland on the NHS. We need to see every man who needs this drug receive it on the NHS, regardless of where they live in the UK.' Human prostate cancer cells: Each year around 37,000 men in the UK are diagnosed with prostate cancer . Each year around 37,000 men in the UK are diagnosed with prostate cancer and 10,000 die from the disease. It is the second most common cause of cancer death in men, accounting for 13 per cent. Sir Andrew Dillon, chief executive of Nice, said: 'During the consultation on the draft guidance Janssen, the manufacturer of the drug, submitted further information for the committee to consider. Scots have on average 16 per cent more to spend per head on NHS drugs than the English, which has opened up a medical care divide. Many working patients in England are currently charged £7.40 per prescription even though they are free to all living in Scotland. Prescriptions are also free in Wales and Northern Ireland. Meanwhile the National Institute for Clinical Excellence has come under frequent criticism for ruling dozens of life-prolonging drugs are not cost-effective enough. Here are some of the recent rulings: . In March 2010 Nice turned down the ‘last chance’ arthritis treatment RoActemra, which is available in Scotland, despite it costing just £25 a day. In June 2010 Nice ruled that Xolair, used to reduce the number of attacks in severely asthmatic children, was too expensive for under-12s. It costs £12,000 a year and is available in Scotland. In May 2011 Nice turned down dasatinib, high-dose imatinib and nilotinib, which can give normal life expectancy for those with a rare blood cancer. The treatment costs £40,000 a year and is available in Scotland. The Government has tried to improve access to cancer drugs in England and Wales by creating a temporary Cancer Drugs Fund. So far sufferers have been prescribed nearly 10,000 treatments denied to them by the NHS through the £200m fund. 'This included a revised patient access scheme which involves providing the drug to the NHS at a discounted price, further information on which patients would benefit most and clarification on how many patients could receive the drug. 'These factors enabled the committee to revise its preliminary recommendation and now recommend the drug for use on the NHS. 'We are very pleased that Janssen's submission to our consultation means that we are able to produce draft guidance recommending abiraterone - it is an effective treatment, potentially extending life by more than three months, and it also allows patients to be treated at home as it can be taken orally.' Professor Alan Ashworth, chief executive of the Institute of Cancer Research, said: 'We are delighted by today's decision to allow patients with advanced prostate cancer to receive abiraterone on the NHS. 'This drug was discovered at the Institute of Cancer Research and is the result of more than two decades of dedicated work by our scientists and collaborators. 'In clinical trials of men with advanced prostate cancer who have already tried chemotherapy, it has been shown to extend life by an average of four months and improve quality of life.' As Nice has not issued final guidance there is a chance the decision could be appealed against, and NHS bodies should make decisions locally on the funding of specific treatments. Nice recommended the use of abiraterone in combination with prednisone or prednisolone for the treatment of castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer that has progressed after one docetaxel-containing therapy.","Final approval of abiraterone for England and Wales expected in June .

A poorly pensioner claims he suffered a stroke when ruthless Transport for London bailiffs tried to snatch his furniture because of an unpaid parking ticket. Mario Ansalone, 71, rushed out of his home when he saw strange men surrounding his car. When he found out they were debt collectors wanting to take away his car or furniture, including his bed, he collapsed on the floor outside. Mario Ansalone claims he suffered a stroke as bailiffs threatened to take away his furniture and bed . The former Rolls-Royce chauffeur had been fined £60 for parking in a ‘loading only’ bay. After an unsuccessful appeal, he did not pay the penalty charge. His wife Margaret returned home to find him lying on the floor twitching and quickly called an ambulance. She said: ‘I splashed some water on him and he was grabbing at his face. If something like this happens again it’ll finish him. 'It was lucky I was coming around the corner at the time. ‘I told them to get out of here. But they said they wanted his bed.’ Mrs Ansalone, who has worked for a local authority for 40 years, said she was forced to pay the bailiffs an increased fee of £410 from their life savings after they threatened they would take either the car or furniture - including their bed. 'It is not right what is happening to disabled people in this country,’ she said. ‘They should lay off them.’ A 'Warrant of Execution' presented to disabled pensioner Mario Ansalone, 71, at his flat in Bloomsbury, London . Mr Ansalone, who suffers from chronic ailments, including arthritis, hyper-tension, diabetes and memory loss, visited his GP surgery and said the doctor confirmed he had suffered a mini-stroke. Italian-born Mr Ansalone, who moved to London from Naples in 1962, said: ‘I’m ill. What they did to me was terrible. I’m old and I’m disabled. ‘I feel humiliated; I just didn’t think something like this could happen in this day and age.’ The disabled blue-badge holder was fined by Transport for London (TfL) after parking in the ‘loading only’ zone while the couple popped into a shop to buy a toy for their grandchild. A camera picked up the parking offence in November 2010. Despite appealing, the couple were unsuccessful and TfL said letters were sent demanding the fine and warning of the consequences about not paying. As they had not paid it, TfL outsourced the fine to a team of bailiffs who visited the couple’s two-bedroom ground-floor apartment in Bloomsbury, London, on April 5. Labour MP Frank Dobson, who represents Mr Ansalone’s Camden constituency, said: ‘TFL definitely need to look into this. Mario Ansalone's block of flats in Bloomsbury, London, where bailiffs threatened to take away his bed because of an unpaid parking debt . 'Even if they did not know he was disabled, you don’t take away a pensioner’s bed in any civilised society. ‘The bailiffs shouldn’t possibly think that it’s acceptable to take away anybody’s bed.’ A TfL spokesman was unable to confirm whether it provided the age of debtors to bailiffs or whether this was a factor in their debt-collecting methods. Paul Cowperthwaite, TfL’s head of contracted services, said: ‘We sympathise with Mr Ansalone’s situation and it is unfortunate that bailiff action was necessary to secure payment for the PCN he incurred. 'Bailiffs are only used as a very last resort. 'Prior to them being instructed, people have the opportunity to appeal their PCN. 'Mr Ansalone was unsuccessful in his appeal with an independent adjudicator and was therefore required to pay the PCN. ‘We do have policies in place covering professionalism, conduct and vulnerable people to ensure that our customers are treated ethically and fairly. 'We have examined this case in detail and are satisfied normal procedures have been followed. 'We take any allegation of mistreatment very seriously and would be happy to investigate further if Mr Ansalone or his family can provide further details.’","Former chauffeur, 71, has blue badge for parking .

A gentler form of prostate cancer treatment that takes only 30 minutes has been devised by British surgeons. The technique is just as effective as surgery but is cheaper and has fewer side effects. This means men are back on their feet and back at work sooner and are much less likely to suffer problems such as impotence and incontinence. Breakthrough: A digital image of prostate cancer cells. A gentler form of prostate cancer treatment that takes only 30 minutes has been devised by British surgeons . Most importantly, the technique, called 4D brachytherapy, is available on the NHS. The treatment, pioneered at the Royal Surrey County Hospital in Guildford, is a more advanced version of brachytherapy, a technique which has been used successfully for more than a decade. Brachytherapy, used on men in the early stages of prostate cancer as an alternative to conventional radiotherapy or surgery, consists of radioactive ‘seeds’ which are implanted into the prostate gland to destroy the tumour from inside. This targeted radiation means higher doses can be used than in traditional radiotherapy and also helps to ensure the bladder and surrounding tissues are not damaged. It also has fewer side effects than prostate removal surgery – a major operation which can involve days in hospital and weeks off work. Surgery also often causes incontinence and leaves up to 80 per cent of men impotent. Brachytherapy usually takes around three hours but the team have refined it to take as little as half an hour without losing any effectiveness. Surgeons use a two-minute scan to . take five key measurements of a man’s prostate. These are fed into a . computer programme which uses information from hundreds of previous . operations to work out how many seeds are needed and where they should . go. Up to 120 seeds, . each the size of a grain of rice, are then inserted into the prostate in . an operation that takes between 30 to 40 minutes. Patients are often discharged on the same day and return to work within 48 hours. Some 83 per cent of men remain potent, more than both surgery and conventional brachytherapy. Incontinence is also much rarer, with fewer than one in 100 patients suffering bladder problems afterwards and, unlike surgery, patients do not need to use a catheter. The treatment is at least as successful at eradicating cancer as surgery and is slightly cheaper at around £5,000 per patient. The technique’s pioneer, consultant urological surgeon Professor Stephen Langley, said surgery and 4D brachytherapy were ‘chalk and cheese’. He said: ‘One option takes five hours and involves a catheter, the other takes 30 minutes and you are out the same day. ‘They are for the same disease, just different treatments.’ Professor Langley is training doctors from a number of British hospitals in the hope that the treatment will soon be in widespread use. Meg Burgess, specialist nurse at The Prostate Cancer Charity, said: ‘We look forward to seeing how this new technique compares to existing brachytherapy treatments and welcome any evidence of a benefit to men with prostate cancer.’","Men back on their feet sooner with new treatment say researchers .

Stephen Hester, the CEO of RBS, will face the same tough questions as his Barclays counterpart Bob Diamond, who has come under increasing pressure to resign in the wake of the scandal . Royal Bank of Scotland is set to be fined about £150 million for participating in market manipulation offences similar to those engaged in by Barclays, it has been revealed. Sources said RBS admitted guilt of offences similar to those committed by Barclays' traders, though at RBS they were more isolated and less serious. The news comes after a sacked RBS trader accused his bank bosses of colluding with staff to rig the financial markets to maximise profits in an explosive set of court documents revealed today. The bank is thought to have accepted that it will probably have to pay about half as much as the £291 million in fines imposed on Barclays, according to the Times. Any settlement with the various regulatory authorities is thought to be several months off, the Times said. Stephen Hester, the CEO of RBS, will now face the same tough questions that have bombarded his Barclays counterpart Bob Diamond, who has come under increasing pressure to resign in the wake of the scandal. Barclays . agreed on Wednesday to pay a record $453 million fine to US and British . regulators for attempting to manipulate the London Interbank Offered . Rate in 2005-08. Britain's banking woes deepened today as the Financial Services Authority said it had settled with four banks - Barclays, RBS, HSBC and Lloyds - after finding evidence they mis-sold products to protect small businesses against a rise in interest rates. Compensation could run into the hundreds of millions of pounds, lawyers have said, although Lloyds said the cost for it would not be material. The FSA said from 2001 to date, banks sold around 28,000 interest rate protection products to customers, although it did not did not say how much it would cost the banks. Guilty: RBS admitted guilt for offences similar to those committed by Barclays' traders, though at RBS they were more isolated and less serious . A string of mis-selling cases has rocked the financial services industry for over two decades and banks are already likely to pay upwards of £9 billion in compensation for mis-selling loan insurance. The Libor mis-selling scandal is expected to draw in many banks globally, but Diamond has found himself first in the firing line after U.S. and British authorities fined Barclays $450 million on Wednesday for manipulating the London interbank offer rate (Libor). Under fire: The Libor mis-selling scandal is expected to draw in many banks globally, but Barclays boss Diamond has found himself first in the firing line . Prime Minister David Cameron said Diamond - who was running the investment banking arm Barclays Capital when the rigging occurred in 2005-2009 - and other bosses had some 'big questions to answer'. Britain also called in the fraud squad to investigate possible crimes. 'Politicians . have already been baying for blood and calling for the head of Bob . Diamond, especially as he was in charge at BarCap at the time,' said . Stephen Peak, manager of the Henderson UK Alpha and European Absolute . Return funds and a shareholder in the bank. 'We . feel that the Barclays board will instinctively wish to resist this, as . Diamond is clearly the architect and leading light of Barclays, but . feel that the pressure may be too great.' Earlier, Tan Chi Min, a former head of delta . trading for RBS’s global banking and markets division in Singapore, . alleged that managers at RBS condoned collusion between its staff to set the . Libor rate artificially high or low to maximise profits. He . named five staff members he claims made requests for the Libor rate to . be altered and three senior managers who he said knew what was going on. He also says the practice 'was known to other members of [RBS]’s senior management'. Mr Tan, who was eventually sacked for gross misconduct, worked for RBS from August 2006 to November 2011and alleges that senior members of staff knew about Libor fixing, and that the behaviour started while Fred Goodwin was chief executive . During his dismissal case he accused Brevan Howard, one of Europe's largest hedge funds, of asking RBS to change the Libor rate. He accused the fund of telephoning the bank on in August 2007 asking if they could change the bank's Libor submission. Investigation: The ex-RBS employee alleges that senior members of staff knew about Libor fixing, and that the behaviour started while Fred Goodwin was chief executive . Banks submit their rates to Thomson . Reuters which then calculates the Libor rate and distributes it on . behalf of the British Bankers' Association. The fund was not named in the court case and was not being sued for any wrongdoing. Tan alleged that it was in fact common . practice among senior RBS employees to make requests to the bank's rate . setters as to the appropriate Libor rate. In . the court papers filed in New York as part of a class action, Mr Lin . also implicates hedge fund bosses who have given thousands of pounds to . the Conservative Party.

Farm workers were stunned to be banned from a pub in Britain’s second richest village for not dressing smartly enough, sparking a row over rural life. Gary Clark and David Dickens each ordered a pint at The Crown in leafy Cookham, Berks, after a hard day’s work. But staff at the pub, beside the River Thames, refused to serve them. The pair were asked to leave for wearing casual trousers and polo shirts, featuring the name and logo of the pick your own farm where they work. Farm workers: Gary Clark, left, and David Dickens, right, were turned away from The Crown in Berkshire because they were dresses in these work clothes . Landlord Matt Smith, 32, today said the pub bans tradesmen and labourers in work clothes because they scare off wealthy locals and are bad for business. The village of Cookham, which has a farming history dating back centuries, and boasts numerous celebrities amongst its residents. They include England’s World Cup winning rugby coach Sir Clive Woodward, artist Rolf Harris and singer Chris Rea. A staggering 41 homes in the village sold for over 1 million pounds in the four years to March 2011. Mr Clark, 44, said: 'Dave and I had just been to visit a friend in hospital after a long day at work and decided to nip into the pub for a quiet pint. 'We were wearing work clothes but they had been covered by our overalls all day and we were clean, so I was stunned when staff told us to leave. 'If we were covered head to toe in dirt I could understand. 'Nobody at the hospital had a problem with our appearance and the pub is open to dog walkers with dirty shoes. 'I was rather taken aback by the way we were told to get out. The man could have been more diplomatic and there was a degree of snobbery about it. 'Snob': Landlord Matt Smith outside The Crown in Reading, Berkshire. He says business is better since banning 'scruffy' workers . 'There were about 50 people inside at the time and the place fell silent - I was really embarrassed because I felt everybody was looking at us as we left. 'I offered to take our drinks outside but the staff insisted we leave. 'The barman said people were not allowed to wear work clothes in the pub but I pointed out people in suits had probably come straight from work. 'Pubs in villages like this used to make their living from those who worked the lands nearby. 'We were forced to get our pint from another pub nearby, which did not mind what we were wearing.' Mr Clark and Mr Dickens work at Copas Farms, which grows arable crops and pick your own fruit and vegetables in 3,000 acres. Mr Dickens, 31, said: 'We are quite close to London and a lot of people with money are moving out here. 'It is causing a bit of tension with those that have lived in the village for years and the new arrivals are pushing prices up. 'Traditional village life used to be built on local tradesmen and farm workers.' The Crown reopened last week after a five month closure and 600,000 pounds refurbishment, which was designed to create a 'lovely country feel'. The opening was attended by local resident and former children’s television presenter Timmy Mallett. The pub’s website says: 'At the Crown at Cookham we welcome all visitors, whether stopping off for a pint, a coffee, a light snack, full meal or an overnight stay.' The menu even has a Ploughman’s Lunch on the menu. Landlord Mr Smith said the definition of builders clothes is exercised at the discretion of staff and is not a total ban on polo shirts. He apologised for any upset caused and said staff had dealt with the issue politely. He added: 'When I took over the pub it was a traditional boozer, where women were not welcome. 'It mainly attracted workers from outside the area and they did not mix with the locals. 'Business was not good and we were at risk of closure so we had to make some changes, which included focusing on food and the local residents. 'Cookham is an affluent village and since we made the changes we have attracted the support of local residents and business is better. 'This is not a class thing, it is just our policy. 'Nightclubs have policies too. You can’t turn up to a nightclub in trainers and scruffy clothes.'

Our solar system could have a 'twin' 130 light years away - with up to nine planets including 'rocky' planets like our own earth. The star system HD 10180 had five confirmed planets - and a new study has confirmed two more, with another two suspected. Most are liable to be 'scorchingly' hot. Astronomer Mikko Tuomi  re-analysed data taken of star HD 10180 with High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS), a high-precision camera mounted on a 3.6 meter telescope in Chile . Record beater: This animation shows an artist's impression of the remarkable planetary system around the Sun-like star HD 10180 . 'The data indicates that there are not only seven but likely as many as nine planets in the system,' said Tuomi told SPACE.com. 'The two new planets appear to have orbital periods of roughly 10 and 68 days and masses of 1.9 and 5.1 times that of Earth, which enables the classification of them as hot super-Earths, i.e., planets with likely scorchingly hot rocky surfaces.' Our solar system has eight planets after Pluto was officially demoted to dwarf planet status. The staar has been studied for . years because at 130 light years away it is relatively close and . therefore brighter and easier for astronomers to examine. Recent . studies detected that the star, which is in the constellation of the . water snake Hydrus, hosted six planets and observed a possible seventh . planet. However, the latest research confirmed the existence of the seventh planet and found a further two planets orbiting the star. Extraordinary: New findings show that the sun-like star could have nine planets orbiting around it . The planets vary drastically in . size and include one which is 65 times the Earth’s mass and one . estimated to be only 1.4 times heavier than Earth - making it one of the . smallest planets discovered outside our own solar system. The . two newly discovered planets weigh in at 1.9 times and 5.1 times . heavier than Earth, 'enabling the classification of them as . super-Earths,' says the study. The new planets follow hot orbits, circling their star in under 10 days for the small one, and 68 days for the larger. Artist's impression: The oft-examined star is 130 light years away and in the constellation of Hydrus, the water snake . Competition: If the findings are proved HD10180's solar system will have more planets than ours since Pluto has been demoted to a dwarf planet . One of the new planets to be discovered and the seventh planet which was confirmed are particularly close to the sun-like star. The . one with a mass of 1.3 times more than Earth is only 3 million km away . from HD 10180, closer than mercury is to the sun, making its surface hot . enough to melt zinc, tin and possibly even iron. The . study explained that the star was a ‘very quiet one’ making it unlikely . that the activity of the two new planets that they detected was caused . by stellar phenomena. ‘Also, . the periodicities we report, namely 9.66 and 67.6 days, do not coincide . with any periodicities arising from the movement of the bodies in the .

Physicians . told the young woman the infection had already spread to her thigh and . hip, and that her whole leg would have to be amputated. Miss . Copeland was flown to the Joseph M. Still Burn Center in Augusta, where . doctors performed a high-hip amputation of her left leg and removed . further infected tissue from her abdomen. Fun loving: Aimee's father, Andy, says describes her as 'outdoorsy' and a 'lover of people' 'The . surgeons advised me that they wanted to try to save her leg, but at . this point saving her life took precedence,' Mr Copeland said on . Facebook. 'They removed all of the infected tissue and advised that she would have limited, if any use of her leg.' 'Aimee .

Friends and co-workers from the Sunnyside Cafe in Carrollton, where Miss Copeland works, have banded together to support her family. WSBTV quoted a friend, Kara Dermo, who said, 'She was awesome, just great ... just really awesome to be around.' Miss Copeland is well-known in Carrollton, where she had organised festivals and activities. Sunnyside cafe owner Gary Duke said: 'She planned to go to work helping troubled youth. Then all the sudden, this devastating accident.' A website for psychology students at the University of West Virginia said of the brave young woman: . 'About Aimee: Bright star, lover of life, infinitely generous of heart and spirit. From Snellville, GA. B.A. from UGA in 2010. Nearing completion of her Master’s degree at UWG Psychology. Loved dearly by family and friends.' Miss Copeland's friends have established Aimee's Fund at the United Community Bank in Carrollton, with the aim of raising money for her rehabilitation. Details are available on the student page dedicated to Miss Copeland. They also plan to hold a blood drive in the university's gym from 2 to 7pm on May 15. Necrotizing fasciitis, more commonly known as 'flesh-eating disease', is a rare but extremely vicious bacterial infection. 'Necrotizing' refers to something that causes body tissue to die, and the infection can destroy skin, muscles and fat. The disease develops when the bacteria enters the body, often through a minor cut or scrape. As the bacteria multiply, they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area. Because it is so virulent, the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body. Symptoms include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea. Organ failure and shock are also common complications. Sufferers must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue. Amputation can become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg. Patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up, to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons.","Aimee Copeland was infected with killer bug through a deep gash on her leg .

Yesterday Mr Blunkett, the former Home Secretary and former Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, told the Mail his beloved companion was put to sleep on Monday. Sadie, a curly-coated retriever-labrador cross, had been enjoying county life at a foster home in a village in Derbyshire after retiring as his guide dog last November.

Scientists have unearthed evidence of a 500-year-old settlement near Lake Ontario so cosmopolitan it has been branded the 'ancient New York City of Canada'. The recently-discovered 'Mantle site' is thought to have had almost 2,000 inhabitants in a 'cosmopolitan' area in 1500 A.D. which was the size of Manhattan. Archaeologists say pottery and art found at the site shows how inhabitants had 'unprecedented' trade with the Iroquois - the nations and tribes of indigenous North America. Scroll down for video . Discovered: A model representation of a longhouse from the Mantle site, displayed at the Royal Ontario Museum. Parts of the longhouses were just some of the 2,000 artifacts found on the site dating from the 1500s . But amazingly, the same groups also acquired European goods a full century before the first European explorers arrived in that region. Despite its huge size, the giant site is thought to have remained undiscovered for so long because its longhouses were primarily made of wood. Among the stunning finds made on the Mantle site are the earliest European goods ever found in the Great Lakes region of North America. Experts recently found copper beads, wrought iron objects, as well as effigies painted into pottery. The discoveries - part of the 'largest, most complex, cosmopolitan village of its time - have been heralded by experts as an 'Indiana Jones moment' in archaeology. Also uncovered during excavations on the site between 2003 and 2005 were 98 longhouses, a palisade fence of three rows, and about 200,000 artifacts. A wrought iron mask found at the site was traced to northern Spain, with its material suggesting it came from the 16th century. The hoard of artifacts will be revealed in a documentary this week on the History Channel in Canada. Evidence found at the Mantle site showed that its inhabitants had 'cosmopolitan' lives in a settlement the size of Manhattan . Signs of life: This human pipe effigy gives a fascinating glimpse into what was found at the Mantle site near Lake Ontario . Ron Williamson, an archaeologist who led dig efforts at the site, said in the programme: 'This is an Indiana Jones moment, this is huge. 'It just seems to be a game-changer in every way.' Williamson, the founder of Archaeological Services Inc., a Canadian cultural resource management firm that excavated the site, told LiveScience: 'It's the largest, most complex, cosmopolitan village of its time. 'All of the archaeologists, basically, when they see Mantle, they're just utterly stunned.' Jennifer Birch, a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Georgia, said in the documentary: 'When you think about a site like Mantle, 2,000 people, massive stockade around a community, a better analogy is that of a medieval town. 'While the cultures are very different, the societal form really isn't.'","Experts unearth 2,000 artifacts from site near Lake Ontario .

A hair-raisingly close fly-by by Nasa's Cassini Probe aims to learn more about what lurks beneath the icy moon Enceladus's surface - and what exactly lurks in the 'geysers' of ice it spews into space. Cassini captured a startling new picture of the jets, which a scientist claimed earlier this year could be 'snowing microbes' onto the icy moon. Nasa's Cassini probe flew past the icy moon Enceladus just 46 miles above the surface to gauge whether there is liquid water beneath the surface - and captured an image of the moon's 'geysers' of ice as it passed by . These jets, which spew through cracks . in the moon's icy shell, could lead back to a habitable zone that is . uniquely accessible in all the solar system. This week, Cassini flew past the moon just 46 miles above the surface. The radio science team is particularly interested in learning how mass is distributed under Enceladus' south polar region, which features jets of water ice, water vapor and organic compounds spraying out of long fractures. A concentration of mass in that region could indicate subsurface liquid water - where life could lurk. Cassini's scientists learn about the moon's internal structure by measuring variations in the gravitational pull of Enceladus against the steady radio link to NASA's Deep Space Network on Earth.Cassini's composite infrared spectrometer instrument will also be observing the side of Enceladus that always faces away from Saturn to monitor for hot spots. The imaging camera team also plans to take images of the plume to look for variability in the jets. Dramatic plumes, both large and small, spray water ice from many locations near the south pole of Saturn's moon Enceladus . ‘More than 90 jets of all sizes . near Enceladus's south pole are spraying water vapor, icy particles, . and organic compounds all over the place,’ Carolyn Porco, planetary . scientist and leader of the Imaging Science team for Nasa’s Cassini . spacecraft told Nasa’s Science News earlier thsi year. ‘Cassini . has flown several times now through this spray and has tasted it. And . we have found that aside from water and organic material, there is salt . in the icy particles. The salinity is the same as that of Earth's . oceans. Cassini passed . Enceladus first on March 27 - coming within 46 miles - then passed the . small moon Janus with a closest approach distance of 27,000 miles . (44,000 kilometres). And early on March 28, the spacecraft flew by Dione . at a distance of 27,000 miles (44,000 kilometres). Thermal measurements of Enceladus's fissures have revealed temperatures as high as -120F. ‘If you add up all the heat, 16 gigawatts of thermal energy are coming out of those cracks,’ said Porco. She . believes the small moon, with its sub-surface liquid sea, organics, and . an energy source, may host the same type of life we find in similar . environments on Earth. She . said: ‘The kind of ecologies Enceladus might harbour could be like those . deep within our own planet. Abundant heat and liquid water are found in . Earth's subterranean volcanic rocks. Scientists believe the geysers may be coming from vast seas full of microbes . ‘Organisms in those rocks thrive . on hydrogen (produced by reactions between liquid water and hot rocks) and available carbon dioxide and make methane, which gets recycled back . into hydrogen. And it's all done entirely in the absence of sunlight or . anything produced by sunlight.’ But what makes Enceladus special is that its habitable zone offers itself up for easy access. She . said: ‘It's erupting out into space where we can sample it. It sounds . crazy but it could be snowing microbes on the surface of this little . world. In the end, it's is the most promising place I know of for an . astrobiology search. ‘We . don't even need to go scratching around on the surface. We can fly . through the plume and sample it. Or we can land on the surface, look up . and stick our tongues out.  And voila, we have what we came for.’ Rock on: Saturn's moon Janus, which Cassini also buzzed . Close-up: Saturn's moon Dione at approximately 27,668 miles . The source of Enceladus's heat . appears to be Saturn itself. Researchers say Saturn's gravitational pull . causes the moon's shape to change slightly on a daily basis as it . orbits. Flexing motions in its interior generate heat - like the heat . you feel in a paperclip when you bend it back and forth rapidly. Porco . said: ‘But the tidal flexing occurring now is not enough to account for . all the heat presently coming out of Enceladus. One way out of this . dilemma is to assume that some of the heat observed today was been . generated and stored internally in the past.’ Porco . believes Enceladus's orbit could have been much more eccentric, and the . greater the eccentricity, she says, the greater the tidal flexing and . resulting structural variations that produce the heat. In this scenario, . the heat would have been stored inside the little moon by melting some . of the ice to recharge the liquid sea. She . added: ‘Now that the orbit's eccentricity has lessened, the heat . emanating from the interior is a combination of heat produced today and . in the past.  But since more heat is coming out presently than is being . produced, Enceladus is in a cooling off stage and the liquid water is . returning to ice. ‘There are models to show that it never really freezes entirely, so the eccentricity may increase again, restarting the cycle.’","Cassini passed Enceladus on May 2 - coming within 46 miles .

Vile: Alan Brigden, 67, began sexually abusing boys between 1977 and 1980 at a school in West Sussex before switching to the notorious St George's School, in Norfolk . A second teacher from a top boarding school has been jailed after he sexually assaulted young boys more than 30 years ago. Alan Brigden, 67, began sexually abusing boys between 1977 and 1980 at a school in West Sussex before switching to the notorious St George’s School, in Norfolk. Brigden, who had been living in Holland, was extradited in January after police launched an investigation into St George’s school following reports of historic abuse. The inquiry led to the . arrest of former headmaster Derek Slade who was eventually jailed for 21 . years in 2010 for sexually and physically abusing pupils. Slade . was found guilty of 50 offences, including possessing pornographic . images of children on a computer and sexually assaulting young boys. A . third teacher from the school, Alan Williams, was also arrested last . year for allegations of sexual abuse but was later found dead at his . home in Stowmarket, Suffolk. Police have also suggested more investigations could follow after further allegations of sexual abuse were made against former staff of St George’s, in Stowmarket. Brigden, who was a maths teacher, admitted four offences of assault with intent to commit a serious sexual offence. He also admitted four offences of indecency with a boy under the age of 14 and six offences of indecent assault on a boy under the age of 14. Shockingly, when officers raided Brigden’s Amsterdam home in January they found a pair of PE shorts and school shorts belonging to one of his young victims from over 30 year years ago, a court heard. Self-confessed: Paedophile Derek Slade, the former headmaster of St George's School, was eventually jailed for 21 years in 2010 for sexually and physically abusing pupils . Jailing him for five years at Ipswich Crown Court Judge Rupert Overbury said Brigden’s guilty plea had spared his victims from reliving the 'horrors of their childhood' in court. He said: 'All the offences involved a gross breach of trust. 'The offences were persistent and amount, in my judgment, to a campaign of sexual offending.' Jan Brewer, prosecuting, said one of . the 14 offences related to his time in West Sussex, with the remaining . 13 committed while he was working in Norfolk. The first offence took place in 1977 while Brigden was teaching at Pennthorpe School, in Rudgwick, West Sussex. 'I was a vulnerable child when he came into my life, I already had been subjected to an extraordinary scale of brutality and abuse under the regime of Derek Slade. 'I was an easy target for someone like Brigden, a man who was in a position of responsibility and who was supposed to protect and educate children. 'I cannot relay how much this man manipulated me. I was left to feel everything was my fault, that something was wrong with me. 'I was convinced as a child that telling anybody anything about the abuse would bring nothing but shame, disbelief and trouble to me. 'I was 11 years old, bright, confident and glad to be in the world before I went to St George’s School. 'I hope that now at 43 years I can begin to discover what it might be like to be glad to be in the world once again.' - Victim of teacher Alan Brigden . While there he took his victim to the Lake District, where he groped him and took pictures. Brigden then left the school and, using the name Morton, began teaching at St George’s School in Wicklewood, Norfolk. While at St George’s, Brigden befriended an 11 year-old boy and took him on a ten-day train trip around England and Wales, where he sexually assaulted him every night. Miss Brewer said the boy had not liked what was happening to him and had asked to go home. She said the situation had been confusing for the victim as Brigden had been nice to him during the day but every night was like 'a bad dream or nightmare'. Nicholas Bleaney, defending, said Brigden suffered from Parkinson’s disease and there was no evidence he had re-offended in the years following the offences. After sentencing, one of Bridgen’s victims said in a statement: 'Alan Brigden was a maths teacher at St George’s Boarding School for Boys in Norfolk who had a profound and lasting negative effect on my life. 'I was a vulnerable child when he came into my life, I already had been subjected to an extraordinary scale of brutality and abuse under the regime of Derek Slade. 'I was an easy target for someone like Brigden, a man who was in a position of responsibility and who was supposed to protect and educate children. 'But in fact his motives to place himself in the position were entirely nefarious. 'I cannot relay how much this man manipulated me. I was left to feel everything was my fault, that something was wrong with me. 'I was convinced as a child that telling anybody anything about the abuse would bring nothing but shame, disbelief and trouble to me. 'I was 11 years old, bright, confident and glad to be in the world before I went to St George’s School. 'I hope that now at 43 years I can begin to discover what it might be like to be glad to be in the world once again.' Senior Investigating Officer Detective Inspector Adrian Randall, of Norfolk Constabulary, said: 'Whilst the conviction and sentencing of Derek Slade was a milestone in this investigation, other allegations have been received relating to St George’s School. 'It is just as important that we get justice for those other victims of abuse. 'One of the offences committed by Brigden happened almost 35 years ago, longer ago than the oldest of Slade’s crimes. 'This, along with the fact that Brigden was living abroad and had become a Dutch national, meant our inquiries were even more complex. 'But today’s result demonstrates that time and borders will not stand in the way of dealing with offenders who may think they have evaded the law. 'I hope that the outcome of today’s hearing is of comfort to those victims who now will not have to relive the traumatic experiences they went through at the hands of Brigden. 'He will never again be allowed to work with children, and will be returned to Holland to serve his sentence.' Slade, a self-confessed paedophile, abused pupils as young as eight and beat them with a cane, slipper or table tennis bat. He also held what he called ‘midnight feasts’ where he would sexually abuse the boys, and famously argued on television for corporal punishment in British schools. Williams, who was a music teacher at the school, was arrested after a number of former pupils made allegations against him. Prior to his arrest, Williams had been working as the director of music at Ashfold School in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. He was found dead on June 10, 2011. St George’s school was originally set up as military boarding school by Oxford-educated Slade in 1977 but was moved to the site in Finborough in 1980. It is now known as the Finborough School and has no links to St George’s. Slade eventually left in 1983 after escaping other charges made against him following an investigation by BBC Radio 4.","Alan Brigden, 67, is the third teacher from elite school accused of sexual abuse ."
"By . Rob Waugh . PUBLISHED: . 03:51 EST, 22 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:35 EST, 23 May 2012 . Google CEO Larry Page; The European Union's antitrust chief gave Google a 'last chance' of a few weeks to avoid formal charges for manipulating search results to promote Google services . Google has been ordered by competition regulators to end ‘abuses’ of its market dominance or risk being fined billions of pounds. The search engine, which has more than 80 per cent of the global market share, is accused of promoting its own products and effectively locking out rival advertisers. The European Commission has written to the US giant highlighting four areas where ‘Google business practices may be considered as abuses of dominance’. It has set a deadline of a ‘matter of weeks’ for the company to propose solutions. If these are not satisfactory,  the EC will begin a formal investigation, which could lead to it imposing huge fines and its own measures. The announcement heralds the most significant transatlantic anti-competition row since Brussels went to war with Microsoft a decade ago. It will also embarrass the Tory Party which has forged close links with Google, as revealed by the Daily Mail last week. Research revealed that ministers, including David Cameron, had met executives an average of once a month since the election. Joaquín Almunia, the EU’s competition chief, has written to Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt demanding action. He said Google favours its own products in search results and ‘copies’ content from rivals without permission. It also stifles competitors with advertising deals with other websites and restricts them from moving their online campaigns to rival search engines, he added. The review of Google’s business practices started in 2010 after complaints from rivals. The commission can levy fines of up to 10 per cent of revenue, which could amount to billions of pounds. Google has agreed to look into the EC’s concerns, though it disputed its conclusions. A spokesman said competition on the web has increased ‘dramatically’ and the company faces ‘tremendous’ pressures. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has launched a similar investigation into claims of anti-competitive practices by Google. Complaints: Google is under EU spotlight over its Android mobile software, the top operating system for Internet-enabled smartphones . Even if Google, the world's most popular search engine, offers concessions, it will still be under the EU spotlight after fresh complaints about its Android mobile software, the top operating system for Internet-enabled smartphones. If remedies were offered by Google within the coming weeks, the antitrust investigation could be brought to a close. ‘I believe that these fast-moving markets would particularly benefit from a quick resolution of the competition issues identified. Restoring competition swiftly to the benefit of users at an early stage is always better than lengthy proceedings,’ Almunia told a news briefing. ‘Google has repeatedly expressed to me its willingness to discuss any concerns that the Commission might have without having to engage in adversarial proceedings. 'This is why today I'm giving Google an opportunity to offer remedies to address concerns that we have identified,’ he said. Almunia said he had sent a letter to Eric Schmidt, Google's executive chairman, with a deadline for a response. ‘In this letter, I offer Google the possibility to come up in a matter of weeks with first proposals of remedies to address each of these points,’ he said. The European Commission launched an investigation into Google in November 2010 after competitors, including Microsoft, accused the company of manipulating search results to promote its own advertising services while demoting those of rivals . Competitors complain that Google's search results unfairly prioritise its own advertising services. Google controls nearly 44% of the global internet advertising market. The Trade Commission is also looking into allegations that Google distorts its search results to steer people to its related businesses, like Google Places. The agency recently hired a big name litigator, Beth Wilkinson, to lead its probe. The Commission has 16 complaints against Google before it, with the latest grievances coming from several online travel agencies, including TripAdvisor, Opodo and eDreams. The majority of complaints are from small competitors across Europe. The FTC is expected to come to a decision this summer on whether Google broke the law. Google is also the leader in U.S. searches, at 66 percent, according to comScore. Almunia is offering Google a last chance before issuing formal charges, said David Wood, a lawyer for lobbying group ICOMP, whose members include Microsoft, British price comparison site Foundem and German online mapping company Hotmaps, all three complainants in the EU case. ‘This is effectively the Commission demanding remedies. Failing that there will be a statement of objections,’ he said. If Google can come up with remedies that the Commission finds acceptable following a market test, the Commission could then end the 18-month-long investigation without fining the company, Almunia said. The Commission has 16 complaints against Google before it, with the latest grievances coming from several online travel agencies, including TripAdvisor, Opodo and eDreams. The majority of complaints are from small competitors across Europe. Almunia said other investigations into Google unrelated to the antitrust issue would continue. ‘We continue the investigations on other issues, on other complaints we received recently, for instance all those complaints referring to Android or some complaints referring for instance to the way travel agencies are dealt by the Google search engine,’ he said. He declined to provide details on the Android investigation. Android-equipped smartphones compete with Apple's iPhone and other systems. The Commission can fine companies up to 10 percent of their global revenue for breaching EU rules and has in the past handed down multimillion-euro fines to Microsoft and Intel, among others. In Washington, two lawmakers who specialize in antitrust urged Google to reach a settlement with European regulators. Senators Herb Kohl and Mike Lee, who are respectively the Democratic chairman and top Republican on the Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, said they were ‘hopeful that Google would be a willing partner with the EU's Competition Commissioner. ‘We continue to urge the FTC to investigate (Google) and to ensure a competitive search market where consumers can fairly pick the winners and losers in our online economy,’ the lawmakers said. A Google spokesperson said: 'We've only just started to look through the Commission’s arguments. 'We disagree with the conclusions but we're happy to discuss any concerns they might have. 'Competition on the web has increased dramatically in the last 2 years since the Commission started looking at this and the competitive pressures Google faces are tremendous.

Death of an icon: The longtime television host died Wednesday at St John's hospital in Santa Monica, California, pictured above . Clark had continued performing even after he suffered a stroke in 2004 that affected his ability to speak and walk. He thrived as the founder of Dick Clark Productions, supplying movies, game and music shows, beauty contests and more to TV. As news of his death spread, a number of TV, screen and stage stars took to Twitter to express their sorrow. Honoured: Dick Clark speaks during a tribute to him at the 58th annual Prime time Emmy Awards in 2006 . Among them was Ryan Seacrest, who has named Clark as a huge influence on his own career. Seacrest said: 'I am deeply saddened by the loss of my dear friend Dick Clark. He has truly been one of the greatest influences in my life'. Not everyone was so reverential. Comedian and actor Dennis Leary referred to Clark as one of the last 'leather faced syrup voiced lizard people.' Among his credits: The $25,000 Pyramid,TV's Bloopers and Practical Jokes and the American Music Awards. For a time in the 1980s, he had shows on all three networks and was listed among the Forbes 400 of wealthiest Americans. Clark also was part of radio as partner in the United Stations Radio Network, which provided programs - including Clark's - to thousands of stations. 'There's hardly any segment of the population that doesn't see what I do,' Clark told The Associated Press in a 1985 interview. 'It can be embarrassing. People come up to me and say, `I love your show,' and I have no idea which one they're talking about'. He was dubbed ‘America’s oldest teenager’ because of his fresh-faced appearance that was seemingly unchanged for years. But the stroke in December 2004 changed that, severely damaging Clark's mobility and leaving him unable to appear on the New Year’s Eve telecast that year. When he returned to Dick Clark's New Year’s Rockin' Eve in 2005, he appeared noticeably gaunt and frail. He was born Richard Wagstaff Clark in Mount Vernon, N.Y., in 1929. Dick Clark, pictured here with wife Kate Wigton, right, was a big influence on American Idol host Ryan Seacrest, centre . His father, Richard Augustus Clark, was a sales manager who worked in radio. Clark idolized his athletic older brother, Bradley, who was killed in World War II.

Never sad: Though his health had faded in recent years, Clark was hardly ever pictured without smiling or flashing his trademark salute .

Jermaine Jackson: 'Dick Clark always came to our dressing pre-show to make sure we were okay and catered for. Big hearted. One-of-a-kind. Will be missed...' Rapper and actor ICE T: 'I'm old enough to remember watching James Brown on American Bandstand.. Dick Clark was the man! RestInPeace' In his 1976 autobiography, Rock, Roll . & Remember, Clark recalled how radio helped ease his loneliness and . turned him into a fan of Steve Allen, Arthur Godfrey and other popular . hosts. From Godfrey, he said, he learned that . 'a radio announcer does not talk to ""those of you out there in radio . land""; a radio announcer talks to me as an individual'. Clark began his career in the mailroom of a Utica, N.Y., radio station in 1945. By . age 26, he was a broadcasting veteran, with nine years' experience on . radio and TV stations in Syracuse and Utica, N.Y., and Philadelphia. He held a bachelor's degree from Syracuse University. While in Philadelphia, Clark befriended . McMahon, who later credited Clark for introducing him to his future . Tonight Show boss, Johnny Carson. The original American Bandstand was one of network TV's longest-running series as part of ABC's daytime line-up from 1957 to 1987. Clark joined 'Bandstand' in 1956 after Bob Horn, who'd been the host since its 1952 debut, was fired. Under Clark's guidance, it went from a local Philadelphia show to a national phenomenon. 'I played records, the kids danced, and America watched,' was how Clark once described the series' simplicity. In his 1958 hit 'Sweet Little Sixteen,' Chuck Berry sang that 'they'll be rocking on Bandstand, Philadelphia, P-A'. As a host, he had the smooth delivery of a seasoned radio announcer. As a producer, he had an ear for a hit record. He also knew how to make wary adults welcome this odd new breed of music in their homes. Clark . endured accusations that he was in with the squares, with critic Lester . Bangs defining Bandstand as 'a leggily acceptable euphemism of the . teenage experience'. In a . 1985 interview, Clark acknowledged the complaints. 'But I knew at the . time that if we didn't make the presentation to the older generation . palatable, it could kill it'. 'So . along with Little Richard and Chuck Berry and the Platters and the . Crows and the Jayhawks ... the boys wore coats and ties and the girls . combed their hair and they all looked like sweet little kids into a high . school dance,' he said. But Clark defended pop artists and . artistic freedom, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame said in an online . biography of the 1993 inductee.

Rock stars: Clark poses with members of the band Metallica backstage at the 31st annual American Music Awards in Los Angeles in 2003 . He helped give black artists their due by playing original R&B recordings instead of cover versions by white performers, and he condemned censorship. Over the years, it introduced stars ranging from Buddy Holly to Michael Jackson to Bon Jovi to Madonna. In 2004, Clark announced plans for a . revamped version of American Bandstand. The show, produced with American . Idol creator Simon Fuller, was to feature a host other than Clark.

When volcanic ash closed Europe’s skies two years ago, Philip Marshall and his family were stranded halfway home from a holiday of a lifetime in South America. But unlike thousands facing similar nightmares, Mr Marshall just happens to be one of Britain’s top barristers specialising in commercial litigation. The QC has since won £10,000 from the airline forced to cancel his family’s flight. He and his wife and three children had enjoyed a fortnight in Ecuador and a visit to the Galapagos Islands. They . had flown back to Madrid, where they were due to board a flight home to . London, when all flights were cancelled as volcano Eyjafjallajökull . erupted in Iceland. At the airport, Mr Marshall, 46, and his . wife Barbara, 47, were told by an Iberia Airlines worker that they were . best off arranging their own way back to London. Holiday nightmares: The Marshall family were stranded in Madrid when ash from Iceland's Eyjafjallajokull volcano grounded planes and closed airports across Europe in April 2010 . In fact, a flight became available the next day. But by then the unwitting Marshalls had begun their own exhausting four-day trip home. They hired a car and drove to Bordeaux, where they spent a night, before driving to Paris. The next day they caught a train to Brussels, where they also overnighted, before boarding the Eurostar to London. Bad advice: The Marshalls (not pictured) were trapped like so many travellers across Europe, but were wrongly told by their airline to make their own way home. A judge said Iberia failed to re-route them as soon as possible . The EU ‘Denied Boarding and Cancellation Regulations’ entitle passengers caught up in the ash chaos in April 2010 to refunds or alternative flights. Iberia Airlines refunded in full the £1,075 cost of the Marshalls’ cancelled flights to London, but refused to refund them the costs of their alternative journey home. Judge William Birtles . Mr Marshall represented himself as  he fought the Spanish airline through the courts to win back the cash  spent on his family’s overland odyssey across Europe. At the City of London County Court  a district judge dismissed his claim  on the grounds that, under the  EU rules, airlines do not have to  compensate passengers in ‘extraordinary circumstances’. But Mr Marshall appealed and the judgment was overturned at the same court by Judge William Birtles, who said the airline had breached its  contract and air industry regulations  in failing to re-route the family as soon as possible. Iberia Airlines was ordered to pay about . £8,000 for the Marshalls’ cost of getting home, plus £2,000 damages for . inconvenience. The airline then tried to challenge this at the Court of . Appeal, without success. This week Lord Justice Aikens said of . the amount awarded: ‘That may be a significant sum for Mr and Mrs . Marshall, I do not know. I am certain it is absolutely insignificant to . Iberia Airlines.’ Out of pocket: Passengers face disruption at Manchester airport. More than 150,000 Britons were stranded overseas, but most did not get compensation because the eruption was deemed 'extraordinary circumstances' Yesterday Mr Marshall said: ‘It was . quite clear to me these airlines want to intimidate people into not . making a claim. There have been conflicting decisions in the county . courts in previous cases as to whether or not you can claim . compensation. I hope my case will assist others in showing you do have a . right to seek compensation.’ He estimated the airline had spent ‘easily . £50,000’ contesting the case, which he described as ‘crazy’.","Marshalls were trapped in Spain after holiday in the Galapagos Islands .

"By . Beth Stebner . PUBLISHED: . 21:37 EST, 6 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 21:37 EST, 6 June 2012 . Students at one of Manhattan's most elite high schools decided to bare their feelings on their school’s conservative dress code – by wearing revealing outfits. Students at Stuyvesant High School took to Wall Street in Lower Manhattan yesterday to protest the institution’s new dress code, calling it 'Slutty Wednesday.' Students said that the dress code implementation is biased and especially unfair to curvier girls, and portrayed all male students as having no self-control. Slutty Wednesday: Students at Stuyvesant High School protested the dress code by wearing items that violated it . Imposing: The school's dress code states that shoulders can't be bared and shorts and skirts have to be past one's fingertips . And, some said, shorter and more breathable apparel was necessary, as the school’s air conditioning units were not always running at top capacity. The New York Times reported that the dress code issue has been an issue long before ‘Slutty Wednesday.’ One student called it a double standard, saying that staff members tend to go after female students, and especially those who are more curvaceous. Those who are found to be in violation of the dress code are then forced to wear baggy grey shirts. Further violations mean more severe punishments. Senior Benjamin Koatz, 18, told the Times: ‘It’s called Slutty Wednesday to symbolise that we’re not actually slutty.’ The right to bare arms: Some students said that as hot weather approaches, it comes down to a matter of comfort . Prestigious: Stuyvesant High School, located in Manhattan's Battery Park area, has turned out four Nobel Laureates . One student told NY1 that she sees the dress code as a non-issue, especially since a school is a place of learning. Stuyvesant High School imposed a new series of dress codes in September 2011, asking that students to wear 'appropriate' attire. As we approach warmer weather we would remind students to wear appropriate attire to school.  Guidelines for appropriate dress include the following: . Source: stuy.edu . ‘They’re like, sexualising our outfits by telling us what to wear,’ the student said. Another added: ‘It’s just more important to learn in school rather than be, like, persecuted for your dress.’ The majority of students came to class with more conservative attire, NY1 reported. The dress code was imposed in September 2011, and asks for students to wear ‘appropriate attire’ while in class. That includes having shoulders, midriffs, and lower backs covered, and have shorts span well below students’ fingertips when their arms are stiffly at their sides. Principal Stanley Teitel told student newspaper the Spectator last fall that ‘people were not wearing things we thought were appropriate for school.’ Stuyvesant was recently ranked eighth by U.S. News & World Report for its standout science and mathematics programs. Four Nobel Laureates have graduated from the institution since its founding in 1904.","Students at Stuyvesant High School upset over 'biased' dress code imposed last September .

Three men were found dead in a BMW parked near Columbia University’s campus in Manhattan’s Morningside Heights neighbourhood in what authorities believe was a drug deal gone wrong. The men were all in their 20s and were discovered around 6:30pm this evening on the outskirts of Columbia University's campus in a dark grey 2009 750 Li BMW. Each appeared to have been shot in the skull, though there were no bullet holes in the car’s windows or doors, sources said. Bloody scene: Three men were found dead in a brand new BMW near Columbia University and the Manhattan School of Music . The $88,000 car was parked near the intersection of W. 122nd Street and Claremont Avenue, between the Union Theological Seminary and Riverside Church, DNAInfo reported. Police told reporters that two men were found in the front seats of the car, while a third was found in the back. Sources said that the shooter was likely sitting behind the driver when he unloaded his rounds. The victims in the front were shot in the base of the skull and the passenger in the back was shot in the left temple and police believe the car had been parked for a maximum of an hour when it was discovered. 'This was a classic triple assassination,' said one source to the New York Post. 'The shooter had to be a cool customer to kill three men so close to him. He was quick and deadly.' One source told the New York Post that the attack, which happened during the day, was ‘a very bloody scene.’ No 911 calls were made to report any shootings and no students at the university claimed to hear any gunfire. Keeping vigilant: Two NYPD officers stand watch over the crime scene; all three victims were shot in the skull . 'Shooting three people in a car is extremely loud and the shooter may . have used a silencer,' said a police source. And 'he may have plugged . his ears.' Hours later, it was reported that 'blood was still dripping' from the car as it sat outside the university's Knox Hall. Police blocked off a wide area around the triple homicide, and have not yet released the name of the three victims. According to the New York Daily News, the driver was Hispanic, and the man in the passenger’s seat was black. They have not yet released the ethnicity of the man in the back seat. 'Oh my God, he’s dead. Kill me, kill me. I hope it’s a lie,' screamed a woman who claimed to be a girlfriend of one of the victims at the scene . ‘Both men in the front seat were wearing white T-shirts, both drenched in blood,’ said a police spokesman. Disturbing the peace: Three men were found on W. 122nd Street near Claremont Avenue, a generally quiet area within Morningside Heights . Addressing: NYPD Deputy Commissioner speaks to reporters about the bloody crime . The police were alerted around 6:30pm by a man walking by the scene who saw the two men in the front seat of the car appeared to be dead. Sources told the Post that they weren’t believed to have been students of the music school or at Columbia. NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne told reporters that authorities will go through surveillance video in hopes of putting the pieces together. Students in the area were badly shaken by the incident. The area, which is full of students from several of the schools and universities around, is generally considered a very safe area of Manhattan.","Dark grey BMW discovered near Columbia University with three dead bodies .

A teenager weighing just six stone was wrongly diagnosed as an anorexic by doctors when she actually had a potentially deadly brain tumour. Nichole Bain, 19, was suffering from severe headaches and sickness when she visited her GP in Blackburn, Lancashire. At the time she had to wear clothes that normally fit an 11-year-old, and her doctor mistakenly thought she had an eating disorder. When her symptoms failed to go away, Miss Bain sought the opinions of other doctors and she was referred to a neurologist. Changes: Nichole Bain weighed just six stone (right) when as a 15-year-old she was wrongly diagnosed as an anorexic by doctors when she actually had a potentially deadly brain tumour. She is now healthy again (left) She was stunned to be told she needed an emergency brain scan, just days before she was due to fly to Turkey on holiday. Tests showed Miss Bain had a malignant brain tumour the size of a 50p coin - and if she had flown on a plane, the air pressure would likely have exacerbated her condition. Miss Bain underwent an operation to remove the tumour. She then endured two months of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, losing her long hair, before she was finally told that the treatment had been successful. Her mother Julie Bain, 41, said: 'We initially got nowhere but all we’re bothered about is seeing Nichole eat again and to know that the tumour has gone. 'Doctors thought she had anorexia or bulimia and each time we went it was different. When the GP said she had anorexia I just thought that a doctor can't be wrong so accepted it. 'Now she’s having a brain scan every four months for two years, then every six months for three years, then every year for five years and then every five years after that. 'There’s still a way to go yet.' Road to recovery: Tests showed Miss Bain, pictured with her mother Julie, had a malignant brain tumour the size of a 50p coin . Miss Bain was 15 and weighed 8.5-stone when in December 2008 she began suffering from severe headaches and constant sickness. Her doctor first said she suffered from migraines, then celiac disease and even bizarrely said she was 'standing up too fast'. She was finally diagnosed with anorexia in April 2009 after her weight dropped to just six stone. Mrs Bain, who is her daughter’s full-time carer, said: 'She complained of a bad headache and felt sick and was dizzy and I took her to the doctors. 'We never saw the same doctor twice so we felt frustrated that we knew something was wrong and they talked to us like we were stupid and gave us painkillers. Schoolgirl: Miss Bain was wrongly diagnosed with anorexia in April 2009 after her weight dropped to just six stone . 'They always said it may be this, it may be that - they never committed to anything. 'They even said that she was dizzy because she was standing up too fast. To say that was disgusting. 'The doctor was about to send her to a psychiatrist about having an eating disorder.' After months of feeling unwell, Miss Bain started hiding being sick from her parents because she was ashamed and thought it was her fault. Mrs Bain said: 'All her food came straight back up, she wasn’t getting any nutrition at all. They even said that it may have been something she had eaten or she was allergic to something. 'I was only after she had the operation and I helped her out the bath that I saw just how skinny she was.' They went to see another GP who sent her for cognitive and non-cognitive tests. Mrs Bain said: 'The GP had a feel round Nichole’s neck and she said that she needed an emergency scan. That’s when we said that we were going to go on holiday to Turkey so they got us in for the scan the next day. 'After the scan we were going to make another appointment and we got told to wait in the treatment room. Then they came in and said, ""You’ve got a brain tumour."" We all had a big long cry.' Miss Bain was admitted to Manchester Children's Hospital where she had an operation to remove the tumour. When she came round doctors said that they had taken out 99 per cent of the tumour; the rest was destroyed by chemotherapy. She had to go through six weeks of chemotherapy and radiotherapy before a more intensive treatment called ‘packer regime’ - before her appetite came back with a vengeance. Since the operation, Miss Bain has had double vision in her eyes and has to have Botox injected into them to make them straight, and also has to have intensive physio to help her walk properly again.","Nichole Bain, 19, was suffering from severe headaches and sickness when she visited her GP in Blackburn, Lancashire .

Rio Ferdinand is at the centre of a row over tobacco advertising after anti-smoking charities accused him of promoting a company that owns one of Asia's biggest cigarette brands. The England and Manchester United footballer features in billboard advertisements and YouTube videos in Indonesia that promote Gudang Garam International's internet-based sports channel, Intersport. But the company is one of Indonesia's largest tobacco firms and its cigarettes, flavoured with spices such as cloves and cinnamon, are popular with children. A spokesman for Ferdinand, who supports the global children's charity Unicef, insisted that the footballer, who does not smoke, was advertising the sports channel and not tobacco. Apology: Manchester United said Rio Ferdinand was sorry for any misunderstanding resulting from his appearance in the ads . It appears that Ferdinand, one of many international football stars to appear in the ads, had been unaware that Gudang Garam International makes much of its profits from tobacco or that his image would be used on billboards which carry the cigarette brand logo. Its Intersport channel shows Premier League football matches and helps to raise the profile of English football in Asia, . The spokesman added that Ferdinand was consulting lawyers about the use of his image in the campaign. The World Health Organisation predicts smoking will kill one billion people worldwide this century. Deborah Arnott, chief executive of the anti-smoking group Ash, said sponsorship deals such as this were banned in the UK because of concerns that they promoted cigarettes to young people. She also called on Ferdinand to dissociate himself from GGI. 'Rio talks a good talk about putting children first when he tweets for Unicef, but he has to put his money where his mouth is,' Ms Arnott told The Observer. 'Well over a third of 15-year-old boys in Indonesia smoke and smoking rates among the young have increased sixfold since 1995. 'Rio is estimated to be worth £40m and to earn more than £100,000 a week; does he really need to do this? 'I hope now he realises what he's done he'll apologise.' Complaint: Indonesia's National Commission for Child Protection has written to Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson to complain about the ads featuring Rio Ferdinand . Separately, Indonesia's National Commission for Child Protection has written to the Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson urging him 'to have this unhealthy promotion removed immediately'. In the YouTube videos, Ferdinand, wearing a red football kit and displaying the GGI corporate badge, says how 'football is everything and everything about football is only on Gudang Garam Intersport'. The final scene cuts to the Intersport logo, which is then followed by the Gudam Garang International logo and a tobacco health warning. Tobacco firms worldwide are keen to cultivate the next generation of smokers, but their efforts are hampered by blanket advertising bans in Europe. No such laws apply in Indonesia, where GGI also operates a music website - which anti-smoking groups claim is another attempt to reach young people. Andrea Crossfield, the director of Tobacco Free Futures, which is campaigning for cigarettes to be sold in plain packets in the UK, said: 'I don't believe that it is a coincidence that Gudang Garam chose a Manchester United player to promote their brand sponsorship of Indonesian football, as the iconic Manchester United kit so closely resembles their own cigarette brand colours.' Ian Gray, from the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, told Environmental Health News:  'We must be concerned about the prevalence of smoking internationally, particularly in the developing world, where it is a major killer. 'It is particularly galling to see a prominent UK celebrity recognised by young football supporters the world over participating in such a distasteful and ill-advised campaign.' A United spokeswoman told The Observer: 'The contractual agreement between Rio and Gudang Garam Intersports runs to 31 October 2012, at which time all forms of advertising will cease. 'Both Manchester United and Rio Ferdinand are sorry for this misunderstanding and will endeavour to ensure that it is not repeated in the future.'","Anti-smoking charities accuse the England star of promoting Indonesian tobacco firm Gudang Garam International .

"By . Sophie Borland . PUBLISHED: . 16:37 EST, 18 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:41 EST, 19 June 2012 . Thousands of family doctors will be paid despite striking on Thursday. Health trusts have decided not to dock salaries even though the GPs will refuse to treat almost all their patients. They claim that a day's pay – £430 to a typical GP on £110,000 a year – is merited because urgent cases will still be dealt with. Strike action: British Medical Association members will go on strike over doctors receiving a £68,000 a year pension . But a practice chief at one NHS trust said: 'It is effectively saying to doctors – ""You take what action you like, we will still pay you"". 'My colleagues and I are absolutely incensed. This is absolutely outrageous.' Around 1.25million appointments, tests and operations will be cancelled when British Medical Association members take their industrial action over pensions. With at least 40 per cent of doctors expected to strike, the impact will be felt in hospitals as well as local surgeries. Daniel Poulter, a Tory MP who is also a hospital doctor, said: 'A doctors primary duty is to look after patients, and yet a strike will see operations cancelled, and patients lives being potentially put at risk. 'The public will be even more shocked to learn that doctors are still going to paid on the day that they strike. If they are going to strike on Thursday, doctors should hand back their pay. Around 1.25million appointments, tests and operations will be cancelled when the industrial action takes place . 'The public will not understand why doctors are striking over receiving a pension of £68,000. This is the kind of generous pension that many hard working people in both the public and private sector can only ever dream of receiving.' Employers generally have the right to withhold pay from strikers or reduce it when only limited duties are performed. But at least nine of the 50 primary care trusts in England have decided not to cut GPs' pay – largely because of the difficulty of doing so. Although surgeries are funded by trusts, GPs are paid directly by the surgeries and are effectively self-employed. The position is different for hospital doctors, who are employees. In most cases, they will lose pay unless they can make up the lost working hours in their own time. None of the 25 organisations contacted by the Mail confirmed pay would be docked for family doctors. Trusts not cutting pay include Buckingham and Oxfordshire, Bristol, Berkshire, Derbyshire, Nottingham, South-West Essex, Sussex and Cheshire, Warrington and Wirral. Secretary of State for Health Andrew Lansley has urged GPs to consider opening their surgeries this Saturday to help deal with the backlog of appointments . NHS Stockport said it was highly unlikely any pay would be deducted. Its spokesman said trusts would find it too difficult to calculate any deductions. Dean Royles, head of NHS Employers, which advises health managers, said: 'The way doctors work can be complex and many will continue to treat emergency and urgent cases, so many organisations have put processes in place for pay as part of their contingency plans to ensure safe care on the day of action. 'This will often involve a proportionate deduction recognising pay for partial performance on the day. 'Many staff will not be participating in the action and will be paid as normal.' Mr Royles confirmed that doctors would not have pay docked if they managed to slot in clinics on Friday morning, for example, when they may have otherwise have been doing paperwork. They would then have to do these administrative chores in their spare time. Some hospitals, however, are planning to cut between 30 and 50 per cent of salaries for Thursday for those that take part. Other sites have decided to pay doctors nothing. Last week Andrew Lansley urged GPs to consider opening their surgeries this Saturday to help deal with the backlog of appointments. In a letter to Hamish Meldrum, the BMA's chair of council, the Health Secretary pointed out that 'today's routine appointments can become tomorrows emergencies'. Responding to the letter, Dr Meldrum insisted that patient safety would not be put in jeopardy. 'Tens of thousands of grassroots doctors feel so strongly that the changes to their pension scheme are unfair and unnecessary that they have decided to take industrial action – the first time in almost 40 years,' he added. 'This is why doctors will be in their usual workplaces and patient safety remains their top priority.' The BMA has not confirmed whether any GPs are planning to work on Saturday but insists any lost work will be made up at a later date . It is highly unlikely that they will take Mr Lansley's advice however as most have not worked at weekends since 2004 when a contract negotiated by Labour enabled them to opt out. Doctors say they already pay a far higher proportion of their salaries into their pensions than other NHS workers. A BMA spokesman said the decision whether to pay striking doctors lay with individual trusts.","At least 40 per cent of doctors expected to strike .

The widest and deepest view of the sky ever made using infrared light has been produced by the European Southern Observatory’s Vista telescope. The image contains more than 200,000 galaxies, with tens of thousands of them previously unknown to astronomers. The telescope is stationed at the ESO’s Paranal Observatory in Chile and is the most powerful infrared survey telescope in existence. Light fantastic: At first glance it may look unremarkable, but this image in fact contains over 200,000 galaxies, each containing billions of stars . It has been trained on the same patch of sky repeatedly to slowly accumulate the very dim light of the most distant galaxies. In total more than 6,000 separate exposures with a total effective exposure time of 55 hours, taken through five different coloured filters, have been combined to create this picture. What’s more, the area of sky that the telescope has been trained on looks unremarkable to the naked eye - but such is the power of the telescope that a treasure trove of objects has been revealed. All of the fainter objects in the image are not stars in the Milky Way, but very remote galaxies, each containing billions of stars – and they can only be detected using infrared technology. This is because the expansion of the universe shifts light from distant objects towards longer wavelengths. For starlight coming from the most distant galaxies that we can observe, this means that most of the light falls in the infrared part of the spectrum when it gets to Earth. As a highly sensitive infrared telescope with a wide field of view, Vista, which began operating in 2009, is incredibly useful for spotting distant galaxies in the early universe. By studying galaxies in redshifted light at successively larger distances, astronomers can trace how galaxies were built up and evolved over the history of the cosmos. Close inspection of the picture reveals tens of thousands of previously unknown reddish objects scattered between the more numerous cream-coloured galaxies. These are mostly very remote galaxies seen when the universe was only a small fraction of its present age.

The nine-year-old schoolgirl first . hit the headlines with her blog NeverSeconds about her measly school . dinners but the real frenzy came after her council banned her from . taking photos . of her food as media coverage allegedly left catering staff fearing for their jobs. The controversial ban led to a flood . of complaints, Martha trended on Twitter and Argyll and Bute Council was . inundated with angry calls and emails and eventually backtracked. Although it only lasted 24 hours, the ban got enough worldwide attention to see . thousands of donations flooding in to Martha's JustGiving site, which . she set up to raise money for Mary's Meals, a charity which runs school . feeding projects in communities around the world. Good cause: Martha's blog, Never Seconds, has raised more than £60,000 since she first started it . Donations to the . page have now hit £100,000, which will see about 9,400 children receive a . daily meal. Martha said:'This is totally awesome and will help so many hungry children.

In recognition of the schoolgirl and . her supporters, they wrote: 'Thank you Martha and Friends' on their . blackboard and sang songs. Food for thought: Martha posted this picture on an internet blog and began to add daily snaps of her lunches, rating and commenting on them . Grim grub: Martha's photos of her school dinner has turned her into an overnight internet sensation . Martha's miserable school dinners look set to spark an outcry over nutrition for the nation's children . Magnus MacFarlane-Barrow, founder and . chief executive of Mary's Meals, said he was humbled by the money . raised through Martha's blog. He said: 'This is incredible and I can't thank Martha and her supporters enough for everything they have done.

'For every £10.70 donated, we are . able to ensure another child will get a good daily meal for a whole . school year and a brighter future.' ONe of the young blogger's fans, celebrity chef Raymond Blanc added: 'The real triumph must be to have raised so much . money for Mary's Meals, this charity which provides nutritious meals for . seriously deprived areas of the world.' The charity success comes less . than a week after officials at Argyll and Bute council ordered teachers . to stop her from photographing her dinners and rating them online. Victory! Martha Payne, 9, and her father David were all smiles after the council's decision to make a u-turn on banning her food blog . In a post headed ‘Goodbye,’ she wrote: ‘This morning in maths I got . taken out of class by my head teacher and taken to her office. ‘I was told that I could not take any more photos of my school dinners.’ But the officials seriously underestimated the youngster’s internet . following and thousands of people, led by celebrity chef Jamie Oliver, . took to Twitter to criticise their decision, leading to a humiliating . U-turn by the council. Within hours of Oliver tweeting to Martha to ‘stay strong’ and urging . his 2.3million followers to re-post his message, the schoolgirl’s blog . became one of the top subjects discussed on the site worldwide. Critics . lined up to accuse the council of ‘bullying’ Martha by trying to . ‘silence her freedom of expression’ and thousands signed a petition to . get them to overturn the ban.

The decision also angered Scottish Education Secretary Mike Russell, whose intervention forced the council to perform a U-turn. Council leader Roddy McCuish announced they would be withdrawing the ban . with immediate effect. He said: ‘It’s a good thing to do, to change . your mind, and I’ve certainly done that.’ Martha’s father, Dave Payne, 39, said common sense had . prevailed. ‘Martha is beaming,’ he said. ‘She came home from school with . a big smile on her face. ‘She is delighted she can carry on blogging, but more so about the money . being raised for the charity. People have been very, very generous. The . way the world reacted to the ban is very revealing, it’s just fantastic . that common sense has prevailed.’ The saga began seven weeks ago when Martha, with permission from . teachers at Lochgilphead Primary School, started taking pictures of her . £2 school dinners and commenting on them as part of a writing project. Because Martha’s home is on the west coast of Scotland, however, . standards for school meals differ and widespread improvements in the . rest of Britain appear not to have been applied. Her first post included a photo of a measly slice of pizza and a lonely . potato croquette, alongside a sprinkling of sweetcorn, a cupcake for . dessert and a lot of empty space. Alongside the photo, the schoolgirl wrote: ‘The pizza in the first pic . was alright but I’d have enjoyed more than one croquette. I’m a growing . kid and I need to concentrate all afternoon and I can’t do it on one . croquette. Do any of you think you could?’ Internet hit: Martha's fearless exposé of daily fare at her (unnamed) school prompted global discussion about shockingly unhealthy food being served . Beside a photograph of a limp looking cheeseburger, two potato croquets, . a few rings of cucumber and a rocket ice lolly, Martha wrote: ‘Today’s . meal was on the menu as Cheeseburger and ice cream/biscuit but as you . can see I got an ice lolly. I prefer ice cream.

After seeing the photographs, Oliver, a veteran school food campaigner, . sent a tweet to her father, which read: ‘Shocking but inspirational . blog. Keep going. Big love from Jamie x.’ Martha later posted that the celebrity chef had sent her a copy of his . Jamie’s Great Britain cookbook in which he wrote: ‘Dear Martha, great . work!!! Clever girl. Lots of love. Jamie O. XXX Keep it up!!’ But last week, Martha, whose mother is a GP, revealed that teachers . wanted her to stop taking the photographs. The council said the decision . was made after an article published in a tabloid newspaper, under the . headline ‘Time to fire the dinner ladies’, left some members of staff at . the school in tears. In an ill-judged 500-plus word statement, they accused Martha’s blog of . being ‘misleading’ and attacked her father for refusing to put an end to . it.

'Unequivocal message': Foreign Secretary William Hague has welcomed further sanctions against President Bashar Assad's regime . William Hague today welcomed a further strengthening of EU sanctions on Syria, intensifying the pressure on president Bashar Assad's regime. The Foreign Secretary said EU ministers meeting in Luxembourg had agreed a series of new measures against Syrian banking, military and state media organisations. Further action had also been taken to strengthen the arms embargo, making clear that the insurance and re-insurance of arms shipments to Syria was explicitly prohibited. It follows the turning back in British waters of a Russian ship carrying attack helicopters to Syria following a warning that its insurance was invalid as it was in breach of the arms embargo. 'This sixteenth round of sanctions against banking, military and state media entities sends an unequivocal message that we will intensify the pressure until the Assad regime ends the killing and implements (UN envoy Kofi) Annan's six-point plan in full,' said Mr Hague. 'The UK will remain vigilant and continue to do all that we can to prevent the completely unjustified arming of a regime that is carrying out appalling crimes against its own people. 'I call on all countries, including those in the region, to implement their own tough measures so that Assad and his henchmen are in no doubt that they must chose a different path or face ever-increasing isolation.' Meanwhile, Syria warned Nato not to enter its 'sacrosanct' territory today as the alliance prepares to discuss possible military intervention after Syria shot down a Turkish warplane. Ankara invoked article 4 of the defence alliance which allows a member state to consult allies if its security is threatened. Face-off: A F4 Phantom Turkish fighter jet like the one shot down by Syrian forces, which led to Nato considering military intervention. Syria warned the alliance not to enter its 'sacrosanct' territory . Spokesman for the Foreign and Expatriates Ministry Dr Jihad Makdessi said: 'We heard previous statements made by the NATO that they have no intention of military intervention in Syria. 'If the aim of the meeting is aggressive in nature, I want to reassure everyone that the Syrian territories, waters and airspace are sacrosanct for the Syrian army.' EU foreign ministers today condemned Syria's shooting of the F4 Phantom jet, but said the bloc will not support military action in the troubled country. 'What happened is to be considered very seriously (but) we do not go for any interventions,' Dutch Foreign Minister Uri Rosenthal. German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle also urged calm. Grip tightens: The extra sanctions follow the turning back in British waters of this Russian ship carrying attack helicopters to Syria following a warning that its insurance was invalid as it was in breach of the arms embargo . 'I think it is still important that we continue to work on a political solution (to the Syrian crisis),' he said as he arrived for a regular meeting of EU ministers. 'De-escalation is crucial at this moment.' Today's sanctions have targeted six . government ministries as well as a bank and television company, bringing . the total on the EU's blacklist to 129 people and 49 entities. 'As long as the repression continues, the EU will continue imposing sanctions against the regime,' said EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton. No details were immediately available on the identity of those blacklisted, but several EU diplomats said on condition of anonymity that assets held in Europe by Syria's defence and home affairs ministries were targeted. Up in arms: Demonstrators protest against Syria's President Bashar al-Assad in Dael near Deraa on Friday, days before the extra sanctions were imposed on his brutal regime . Also on the list were a bank, a television firm, an oil transport company and a security office of the Baath party, sources said. The measure follows an incident some days ago involving a British-insured Russian cargo ship carrying attack helicopters for Syria. The United States alerted Britain to the consignment and British security services told insurers Standard Club that providing insurance for the shipment would breach EU sanctions, reports said. Standard Club then cancelled insurance for the ship as well as others in the fleet owned by Russian cargo line Femco, forcing the vessel to head home.","EU ministers agree new measures against banks, military and state media .

A primary school could collect up to £150,000 from the sale of a painting which has hung in its hall for the past 86 years. Captain of the Eleven by Philip . Hermogenes Calderon, which depicts a fresh-faced Victorian boy preparing . to defend his cricket wicket, . It became one of the most famous images of the late Victorian and Edwardian period after being used in a pioneering advertising campaign to promote Pear's soap. Iconic: Captain of the Eleven by Philip Hermogenes Calderon depicts a well-scrubbed Victorian boy preparing to defend his cricket wicket and was very famous at the time, used in a Pear's Soap advert . The much-loved painting was picked by the soap company as it represented the innocence of childhood, which was a popular theme among the Victorians who viewed children as models of truth and honesty. The little boy was deemed to look cherubic, with his flawless complexion. Painted in 1882, at the height of . Calderon's career, it was included in the famous Pears Annual in 1898 . and then reproduced countless times on posters, postcards and . presentation cricket bats during the 20th century. An English painter of French and Spanish descent Philip Hermogenes Calderon is famous for his portraits and subject pictures. Born in Poitiers, France, his father, the Rev. Juan Calderon, was Professor of Spanish literature. As a boy Calderon wanted to become an engineer but grew fascinated with drawing technical figures and diagrams and decided instead to study art. He attended Leigh's art school in London before heading to Paris to study under Picot in 1851. Calderon was the leader of the St John's Wood Clique - a group of fun-loving Victorian artists living around the St John's Wood area of London who were famous for their love of practical jokes. Other members members included George Dunlop Leslie, Henry Stacy Marks, George Adolphus Storey, David Wilkie Wynfield, John Evan Hodgson and William Frederick Yeames. His first works for the Royal Academy were By the Waters of Babylon (1853), followed by Broken Vows (1857) which shows a woman overhearing her lover betraying her through a garden fence. Originally inspired by the Pre-Raphaelites, his work later encapsulated historical, biblical, and literary themes. An 1891 painting St Elizabeth of Hungary's Great Act of Renunciation won Calderon the Chantrey bequest. Depicting the saint bending naked over an altar watched by monks it was perceived as anti-Catholic and generated a huge amount of controversy. The company brought art to a wider audience with their famous annual, first published in 1891, and would include large lithographs for framing. However, the painting would never have become famous without Thomas Barratt, Pears managing director and Francis Pears' son-in-law, who first spotted the fresh-faced cricketer and realised its potential. Known as the father of modern advertising, he also commandeered Sir John Everet Millais' iconic painting Bubbles, after seeing it in the Illustrated London News in 1886. It then became one of the most recognisable images of the late 19th century and made the artist a global household name. Tracey Harrison, headteacher of Thames . Primary School in Blackpool, Lancashire, said of the school's artistic . treasure: 'It was later bought by a local councillor who presented it to . the school which was in his ward in 1926. 'We have long known it is a valuable painting, but the priority is providing the best possible facilities. 'Ours . is a 19th-century school with some classrooms in need of modernisation . and if the painting reaches its estimate of £100,000 to £150,000, that’s . what the money will contribute to. 'The . painting also needed restoration and as part of preparing it for sale, . Bonhams (the auctioneer) have had it lightly cleaned and details such as . a wall and colourful flower bed behind the boy have appeared.' Although born in France to a French . mother and Spanish father, Calderon was the leader of a group of artists . called the St John's Wood Clique. Their aim was to introduce a fresh . approach to historical painting. He began exhibiting his work at the . Royal Academy in 1853 and became a highly regarded Royal Academician and his most famous work, Broken Vows, is in the Collection of Tate Britain. However the Captain of the Eleven is . already attracting plenty of interest, according to Bonhams’ director of . 19th-century paintings, Peter Rees, in part because of its important . association with early advertising. Home for 86 years: The painting found an unlikely home in the hall of Thames Primary School in Blackpool, Lancashire . He said: 'Pears . pioneered modern advertising techniques using images to reinforce the . qualities they wanted the public to associate with the product.' He added: 'It was bought by Pears’ managing director Thomas Barratt, who was skilled at spotting works that might help in the marketing of their famous brand of clear soap. 'It was given away free as a print in the 1898 Pears Christmas annual and became one of the most reproduced images of the early 20th century, appearing, for example, on presentation cricket bats.' The painting will go to auction next month.","Captain of the Eleven by Philip Hermogenes Calderon depicts a Victorian boy preparing to defend his wicket .

Crisis: Cyprus has become the fifth eurozone country to apply to Brussels for a bailout . It has just four days left to raise at . least 1.8 billion euros - equivalent to about 10 per cent of its . domestic output - to satisfy European regulators about the health of . Cyprus Popular Bank, its second largest lender which saw its balance . sheet hurt by bad Greek debt. Finance Minister Vassos Shiarly said the . country would also seek enough money to help with its budget deficit. The full amount would be decided over the course of weeks. 'The amount will be as much as it may be needed to cover the recapitalisation and fiscal requirements,' he told Reuters. 'These will be established after careful review during the next few weeks.' With its coffers emptying rapidly and hurtling towards an immovable deadline, the island suffered a further sovereign credit rating cut on Monday by Fitch, to the non-investment, or junk, BB+ grade. Cyprus has already been shut out from . raising new funds on capital markets, with yields on its existing bonds . well into double digits. Cypriot President Demetris Christofias, The EU's only Communist leader, has been reluctant to accept the fiscal and regulatory conditions that might be attached to a European rescue . Cypriot officials said the bailout request did not specify how much they need from their EU partners. An . island with just 1 million residents, Cyprus has a disproportionately . large financial sector that is heavily exposed to Greece, a neighbour . more than 10 times the size with which it shares a language, culture and . close political links. A . government statement said: 'The purpose of the required assistance is to . contain the risks to the Cypriot economy, notably those arising from . the negative spill over effects through its financial sector, due to its . large exposure in the Greek economy.' With a bailout widely viewed as all . but inevitable, Cyprus has for weeks been trying to juggle its options . between a bailout from Europe's rescue funds - the temporary EFSF and . the permanent ESM - or a bilateral loan from either Russia or China. Cypriot . President Demetris Christofias was scheduled to brief political leaders . on Tuesday afternoon, a statement from the presidency said. The . EU's only Communist leader, Christofias has been reluctant to accept . the fiscal and regulatory conditions that might be attached to a . European rescue. As late as . this weekend, trips by government officials to China suggested Cyprus . was still holding out hope for a bilateral loan from a third country. On Friday night Christofias spoke of 'trying to avoid' the mechanism.Commerce, . Industry and Tourism Minister Neoklis Sylikiotis was dispatched to . China, where talks were focused on a loan or a Chinese investment in the . troubled Cyprus Popular Bank. 'We have had some contacts... We have . requested an answer in coming days,' Sylikiotis said in comments to the . state broadcaster hours before the government said it would be applying . to the EU. Moscow already . provided Cyprus with 2.5 billion euros in a bilateral loan last year and . has an interest in maintaining Cyprus as an offshore financial centre . with low tax rates for Russian businessmen, who use it as a base to . reinvest in Russia. Gloom: A commercial property lies vacant in the island's capital Nicosia. Cyprus has a disproportionately large financial sector that is heavily exposed to Greece . However, seeking such large sums from . Moscow or Beijing is controversial in Cyprus, where EU membership is a . matter of national pride. It could be embarrassing for Brussels as well, as Cyprus assumes the bloc's rotating presidency on July 1. Cyprus . is fiercely protective of a corporate tax rate that is one of the . lowest in the EU, and eight months before a general election shows no . appetite for the stringent spending cuts likely to be demanded in return . for EU funding. Christofias has repeatedly said any economic measures would not further impact 'the workers'. The European Commission has . repeatedly urged Cyprus to take measures to cut its deficit below 3.0 . percent and increase the competitiveness of the economy. The . government says it is in the process of implementing such steps and . targets a deficit of about 2.5 percent of GDP this year. Cyprus . is fiercely protective of a corporate tax rate that is one of the . lowest in the EU . 'The main source of concern is the bank recapitalisation, but given that the European Commission is coming out quite strongly about excessive imbalances in the Cypriot economy one would expect them to look at that too,' said Michalis Florentiades, head of economic research at Hellenic Bank. Cyprus Popular needs a capital infusion urgently to satisfy regulators after writing off the value of Greek government bonds in a sovereign debt swap earlier this year. In its report, Fitch said the recapitalisation bill for Cypriot banks could potentially reach 4 billion euros. That amount, equivalent to 23 percent of GDP, would also take into account rising non-performing loans from the domestic market.","Bailout to cover budget deficit as well as banking sector .

Windfall: Kimberly Smedley earned at least $1.3 million from her illegal butt enhancement business, where she injected clients with industrial silicone . An unlicensed cosmetic surgeon has been sentenced for injecting customers' buttocks with commercial silicone in hotel rooms and using glue and cotton balls to prevent the substance from leaking out. Kimberly Smedley, 47, of Atlanta was sentenced to three years in prison yesterday in federal court in Baltimore. She was also ordered to pay a $25,000 fine and more than $8,000 in restitution. According to her plea agreement, Smedley administered the injections in hotel rooms in several cities, using silicone intended to be used for metal or plastic lubrication, as an additive for paint and coatings, and as furniture or automotive polish. The customers, who wanted their buttocks enlarged, paid between $500 and $1,600 in cash for each session. Federal prosecutors believe Smedley  made at least $1.3 million while operating her illegal practice out of hotel rooms in Baltimore, Washington, Detroit, Philadelphia and New York. Ahead of her sentencing on Thursday on a  federal conspiracy charge, prosecutors said a forensic accountant's . review of Smedley's bank accounts found $1.513 million in receipts . related to the practice. She kept the silicone in a water jug for the procedures - and used 'super glue with cotton balls to prevent silicone leaking out' of the women's flesh. She charged '$500 and $1,600, always in cash, for . each session where she typically injected silicone in nine places on each . side of the buttocks', according to court papers. She ordered nearly 5,000 pounds of silicone from one manufacturer alone, The Smoking Gun reported. Smedley, from Atlanta, Georgia, told . clients that the silicone was medical grade. However it was actually . intended for metal or plastic lubrication, as an additive for paint and . coatings, and furniture or automotive polishes, according to Baltimore . district court. The therapist offered to inject the chemical 'into the buttocks of customers for larger and fuller buttocks in exchange for money' according to The Smoking Gun. Many of her customers between 2003 and 2011 were strippers. Lavish life: Smedley, 45, (with unidentified male) charged $500 to $1,600 each time for silicone injections . She had used her earnings to fund a . lavish lifestyle, driving a luxury SUV and living in an exclusive . Altanta neighbourhood where homes are worth around $500,000. Smedley . was investigated last year after one woman fell seriously ill from . receiving silicone injections. She was arrested at a hotel in Washington . D.C. as she was preparing to see customers. In 2008 investigation by the New York Post, Smedley said: 'I can't tell if you'll have scars or not. You have to know your . own body. You need to be sure of what you're doing. I'm not promising . anything.' Illegal silicone injections, often . used by sex workers and those in the transgender community to alter . their appearance, are incredibly dangerous and even life-threatening. Makeshift practice: Smedley reportedly saw clients in hotel rooms across the U.S. to administer injections including this one in downtown Washington D.C. Dr . M.R. Khalifeh, a plastic surgeon, told Fox: 'We see . long-term effects six months to a year later. The silicone can bubble . to the surface and cause chronic infections. It is really difficult to . treat.' Smedley's actions came to light after . another practitioner of illegal silicone buttock injections was jailed . earlier this year. Padge-Victoria Windslowe, a transgender . hip-hop singer who calls herself 'Black Madam', faced charges in connection with the . killing of a woman who died after a botched bottom implant. Windslowe, 42, was about to host a 'pumping party' in Philadelphia, where women receive black market implants, when she was apprehended. An unidentified 23-year-old woman was treated for a blocked artery in the lung and spent . seven days in hospital. She later died of complications caused by . an illegal implant allegedly made by Windslowe. In another gruesome case in Miami, Florida, a transgendered woman, Oneal . Ron Morris, 30, was arrested after a patient complained the bogus doctor . pumped tyre sealant into her buttocks. Second case: 'Black Madam', also known as Padge-Victoria Windslowe, was . about to host a 'pumping party' at a home in Philadelphia when she was . apprehended, police said . Some 30 people across the U.S. have come forward with claims they were scammed by Morris. One alleged victim Rajee Narinesingh, accused Morris of making her 'into a . monster' after she received several procedures from her in . 2005. Narinesingh, a transgendered woman, wanted fuller lips, cheeks and chin, but could not afford an operation by a licensed plastic surgeon and said she heard about the 'fake doctor' by word of mouth. After being injected with a cocktail of toxins, she was allegedly left with lumps in her cheeks, a misshapen chin and upper lip. She later had to pay a real surgeon to repair the botched job. Morris, who also used super glue on her patients' wounds, was charged with two felony counts of practising medicine without a license with serious injury.","Kimberly Smedley operated in hotels across the U.S. for 8 years .

The bear was identified from fossil teeth, and is thought to have roamed Europe 11 million years ago. The bear would have had a dark coat with white spots in its chest, around its eyes - and would have been smaller than any bear species today . A Spanish team of scientists, among whom are researchers at the National Museum of Natural Sciences, has described a new fossil species in the area around Zaragoza. Agriarctos beatrix was a small plantigrade omnivore and was genetically related to giant pandas, according to the authors. Researchers at the National Museum of Natural Sciences and University of Valencia, suggest that this plantigrade lived during the Miocene, 11 million years ago. ‘This kind of bear was small, even smaller than the specimens of Malayan sun bear, the smallest found today. It probably didn't exceed 60 kilograms of weight,’ explains Juan Abella, a researcher at the Department of Paleobiology MNCN -CSIC and first author of the study, published in Geological Survey. Tian Tian the female Panda cools down in her pool at Edinburgh Zoo: Researchers now believe that a relative of the omnivorous bear may have lived in Spain 11 million years ago . Despite having only found fossil teeth, scientists say the creature should have had dark coat with white spots located mainly in the chest, around the eyes and possibly the closest to the tail . ‘This pattern is considered primitive for the bears, similar to the giant panda, in fact, which have such large white spots that appear to be white with black spots,’ says Abella. Agriarctos beatrix, Ursidae f would have been an animal that lived in the forest and would have had more sedentary habits that bears more hunters like brown or polar. It probably escaped predators by climbing trees. 'Its diet would have been similar to the Malayan sun bear and spectacled that feed almost exclusively on fruit and vegetables and occasionally some small vertebrates, insects, honey and carrion,’ said the expert. ‘We determined it was a different species from those described so far based on morphological differences and the size of the teeth found, says the scientist. We have compared with species of the genus (Agriarctos) and the like from the same period (e Indarctos Ursavus). ‘ . 'The causes that led to their extinction yet to be determined but ‘most likely is forests giving way to more dry, open areas - and the occurrence of similar species that were larger and more competitive,’ says Abella.","Fossil of omnivore found near Zaragoza, Spain .

She then coached her older five-year-old child to lie to police about why the younger boy was 'covered in bruises from head-to-toe'. Chasity Renee DuFour, 25, inflicted violent beatings on her son that left him brain damaged, it is claimed. The alleged abuse surfaced when the boy was admitted to Mary Bridge Children's Hospital (pictured) in Tacoma, Washington . The alleged abuse came to light when the boy was placed in intensive care at Mary Bridge Children’s Hospital in nearby Tacoma suffering from severe head trauma. Suspicious doctors called police who launched an investigation into the 'life-changing injuries' in late May, reports SeattlePI.com. DuFour shook or choked the boy so violently that he received significant brain damage, King County Courthouse in Seattle heard last Friday. Senior Deputy Prosecutor Cecelia Gregory told the hearing: 'The victim was covered in bruises from head-to-toe, partially blinded and will have lasting neurological and physical challenges after suffering repeated assaults at the hands of the defendant.' DuFour was also seen hitting her son when he urinated in his trousers, prosecutors allege. When police contacted the defendant the day after the allegations arose, she claimed he may have sustained his injuries by falling off a bed. She also said she rarely spanked her children, the court was told. When confronted with the allegations of abuse, DuFour refused to continue speaking with the police. The detective assigned the case also questionned the boy's father, who is DuFour's boyfriend, and his babysitter. Both said they had never seen DuFour hit any of her children. The boy had been living with her at her Enumclaw home since April. The hearing was told she may have found the child difficult to control. DuFour is charged with second-degree assault on a child. She is currently in jailed with bail set at $250,000.","Chasity Renee DuFour, 25, inflicted numerous violent beatings on the boy, it is alleged ."

Russia wants the ability to censor the internet - but the U.S. plans to stonewall the plans at a U.N. conference later this year. Russia says it wants wants the right to block access where it is used for 'interfering in the internal affairs, or undermining the sovereignty, . national security, territorial integrity and public safety of other . states, or to divulge information of a sensitive nature'. The member nations of the United Nations will gather this December to create a treaty for the World Conference on International Telecommunications - and Russia has already made it clear which way it wants the internet to develop. Russian President Vladimir Putin has long called for a centralised control of the internet. Internet block: President Vladimir Putin, right, pictured taking part in a wreath laying ceremony this morning, wants centralised control of the web . The U.S. delegation has vowed to block any proposals from Russia and other countries that they . believe threaten the internet's current governing structure or give . tacit approval to online censorship. But those assurances have failed to ease fears that bureaucratic tinkering with the treaty could damage the world's most powerful engine for exchanging information, creating jobs and even launching revolutions. Examples of where the internet has acted as a voice for change include when social networks played a key role in the Arab Spring uprisings that last year upended regimes in Egypt and Tunisia. The wording of Russia's provision for the treaty allow a country to repress political opposition while citing a U.N. treaty as the basis for doing so. The provision also appears to contradict Article 19 of the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which says people shall have the right to access information 'through any media and regardless of frontiers.' An amended treaty would be binding on the United States if it is ratified by the Senate. But approval is not automatic. The treaty is sure to be scrutinised by lawmakers wary of its potential impact. The U.N.'s International Telecommunication Union, which oversees the treaty, does not operate like the U.N. Security Council, where the United States has the power to veto resolutions to which it objects. The ITU works on a consensus basis. Proposals can be stopped from serious consideration if enough countries voice their objections. A global concern: Protesters from the Anonymous India group in Mumbai of hackers wear Guy Fawkes masks as they protest against laws they say gives the government control over internet usage . More than 190 nations will attend the Dubai conference and the U.S. delegation is seeking support for its positions at the preparatory meetings that will continue until the conference convenes. 'It is important that when we have values, as we do in the area of free speech and the free flow of information, that we do everything that we can to articulate and sustain those values,' Philip Verveer, deputy assistant secretary of state and U.S. coordinator for international communications and information policy, said in an interview. The drafting and debating of proposals in preparation for the Dubai conference have taken place largely behind closed doors. Public interest groups have criticised the process and said it runs counter to development of sound public policy. In response to calls for transparency, two research fellows at George Mason University's Mercatus Center launched the website WCITLeaks.org earlier this month as a way to make documents that have been leaked to them by anonymous sources available publicly. The negotiations have sparked rumors that the U.N. and the ITU are plotting to take control of the Internet from the loose coalition of nongovernmental organizations that establishes Internet policies, standards and rules, they said. Tents and protesters during a sit-in against the delay of the Egyptian presidential results and the military rulers, today: Protesting would be much harder with a censored web . The ITU's secretary general, Hamadoun Toure, has called the takeover rumor 'ridiculous.' The ITU said the preparatory process is open to all member states as well as hundreds of private sector and academic organizations. The member states, not the ITU, determine the rules of participation and are free to share documents and information as they see fit, the agency said in an emailed statement. Several . lawmakers questioned Verveer, who also testified, and McDowell about . the relationship between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Toure, the . ITU's secretary general. Their . fear is that Putin, who long has pushed for centralised control of the . Internet, will use his allegedly close ties to Toure to accomplish that . goal. Toure, a native of . Mali, received advanced degrees in electronics and telecommunications . from universities in Moscow and Leningrad. 'Is . this relationship a concern?' asked Republican Rep. Greg Walden, the . subcommittee's chairman. 'What steps are we taking to be able to . counterbalance that relationship?' Verveer told Walden he has no doubts about Toure's honesty and fairness. But . McDowell struck a more ominous tone. Putin's 'designs' need to be taken . very seriously, he said, and urged proponents of Internet freedom to be . on guard for 'camouflaged subterfuge' that could threaten the . Internet's future. The treaty, known formally as the International Telecommunications Regulations, was developed in 1988 to deal with global telephone and telegraph systems that were often state-run. The conference in Dubai, which is being held by the ITU, will be the first time in 20 years that the treaty is being opened for revisions. Independent organizations, including the Internet Society, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers and the Worldwide Web Consortium, for years have served as the Internet's governing bodies. They handle core tasks like network and domain name administration and make decisions based on input from the public and private sectors. This system allows the Internet to evolve organically and rapidly to changes in technology, business practices and consumer behavior, according to open Internet advocates. Yet countries still grappling with how communications have been transformed by the Internet view the ITU and the treaty as the best avenues for plugging themselves into the global information economy. For developing nations that don't have an effective broadband infrastructure, bureaucratic and regulatory measures can allow them to benefit financially from the traffic that crosses their borders. But treaties are static instruments that often are unable to adapt and adjust to the fast pace of Internet innovation, said Sally Shipman Wentworth, senior manager for public policy at the nonprofit Internet Society. 'Further, we do not believe that we should simply take the 1988 regulatory model that applied to the old telephone system and apply it to the Internet,' she said. A proposal offered by a European association of telecommunications network operators would put pressure on content providers such as Google, Facebook and Netflix to offset the costs of delivering Internet traffic to end-users. Traffic increasingly includes bandwidth-hungry video, and the proposal from the European Telecommunications Network Operators' Association essentially argues that the investment needed to expand and improve the transfer of data should be borne by the operators and the content providers. Verveer called the proposal unworkable . and said it would have unintended consequences, such as blocking . Harvard, MIT and other universities from putting courses online at no . cost to users in places where access to education is already limited. 'If . it became necessary to pay in order to make these courses available, . they would predictably become less available, which would be very . unfortunate,' he said. The . threat to Internet freedom won't come in the form of a 'full-frontal . assault,' Roger McDowell, a Republican member of the Federal . Communications Commission, said at a congressional hearing last month, . 'but through insidious and seemingly innocuous expansions of . intergovernmental powers.' His warning resonated with members of the House Energy and Commerce communications and technology subcommittee.","Russian President Vladimir Putin 'wants there to be centralised control of the internet'

Emily Valenzuela, 29, had arranged for her cousin Christa Valenzuela, 32, to live rent free at her home in San Diego, California, on the condition that she look after her pet Bert. But Christa was unable to cope with the puggle because in December last year, just weeks after Emily had left on her deployment, she took him to the local Department of Animal Services. Shock: U.S. Navy petty officer Emily Valenzuela, based in San Diego (pictured), returned home from seven months at sea to discover her dog had been put down . There, animal experts were also unable to control Bert, who bit handlers and refused vaccination. He was euthanised a week after arrival when they could not pass him to another shelter. Spokesman Dan DeSousa told UTSanDiego.com how the animal was turned in as a stray. He said: 'The person said it had just wandered into their apartment.' He added: 'The dog was probably fearful. We understand that, but we just could not touch this dog at all.' When Emily, who is originally from Orlando, Florida, returned home from her tour of duty earlier this month, she was desperately looking forward to being reunited with Bert. Instead, her cousin told her she had taken him to an animal shelter to be adopted. Emily said: 'I thought she was joking. I seriously was in complete shock.' Worse news was to come. In a bid to find out what had happened to Bert, Emily placed an advert on Craigslist and quickly found out his unfortunate fate. She said: 'It was definitely not the homecoming I was expecting to have.' Emily is now considering pressing charges against Christa, but police have said they will not intervene in what is a civil matter. Christa claims that there was no written agreement for her to look after Bert. She did, however, admit that the subject 'could have been mentioned once'. She said she could not control Bert adequately after the puggle defecated and urinated inside the apartment, bit her twice and ran away twice. Christa said: 'She knew the dog and I didn't get along. I told her the problems I had with the dog, and she never trained him. If she had trained the dog and kept in communication with me, the dog would still be here.'

Courage: Bethany Loerke, 20, was sexually abused by her adoptive father and has now revealed her identity to help other victims . A young woman who suffered years of sexual abuse at the hands of her adoptive father has courageously revealed her identity to help other victims. Bethany Loerke, 20, spent her early childhood in the foster care system before being adopted by a doctor and his wife, a nurse, to be raised with their three biological children. However behind the facade of a privileged upbringing, Miss Loerke was sexually assaulted by the man who was supposed to protect her from the age of five. The attacks were only revealed when the girl worked up the courage to tell her mother shortly before her 11th birthday. Doctor James Loerke pleaded guilty to sexual molestation and was sentenced to 20 years in 2003 - however he is . eligible for parole in three years after his sentence was reduced. For years, Miss Loerke, from Tulsa, Oklahoma, was known to the press as 'the girl' as her identity could not be revealed. However now, with the support of her family, she has taken the brave step of shedding her anonymity to help others suffering abuse who may be afraid to come forward. She told the Tulsa World: . 'This fight isn't for me anymore. I fought my battle, I played my role. Now, I'm fighting for all the victims who didn't get to come forward. Ordeal: After spending years in the foster care system, Miss Loerke was adopted by a doctor and his wife in Tulsa, Oklahoma, only for the man to abuse her . 'It's for those people who were victimized and didn't have to be. It's for kids who died because no one came forward and no one was there to help.' Bethany was found living in a filthy trailer with her younger sister when she was two years old with no running water or electricity and overrun by dogs. She was left partially blind due to untreated pink eye and shingles. The toddler was placed in the foster care system and moved between ten homes in a year. After three years, Bethany and her little sister were adopted by the Loerke family. Her adoptive father's abuse started almost immediately - but Bethany did not speak up for fear of being returned to foster care. Innocence: Bethany Loerke growing up (far right) with her siblings. She hid years of sexual abuse from her family . Bethany finally blurted out the truth to . her adoptive mother Beth shortly before a slumber party to celebrate . her 11th birthday. Her adoptive mother believed Bethany from the start and walked out on her husband, taking her five children with her. Beth Loerke told the paper she had no regrets over her actions to protect all her children. Brave step: Bethany Loerke who was known as 'the girl' for years by the media, has waived her anonymity after being abused . She said: 'You have to do the right thing in the best interest of your child. That's the only thing that should be important.' However Bethany struggled to come to terms with the abuse she had suffered at the hands of her adoptive father. She also missed almost a year of school as she had to take part in court proceeding against Loerke. She said: 'I had this circle around me that I couldn't feel anything. I felt like an island - like an infectious leper.'

The Government must resist the temptation to over-regulate the internet despite the growing threat a major cyber-attacks, a senior minister warned today. Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude issued the caution as he revealed that UK Government computer networks are ‘regularly targeted’ by foreign intelligence agencies and groups working on their behalf. Speaking during a visit to Estonia, Mr Maude said the UK was aware of the dangers from ‘the dark side of cyberspace’ and confirmed a dedicated unit is helping to guard the London Games against cyber-attack. Warning: Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude said a dedicated unit was being set up to protect the London Olympic games against cyber attack . He said: ‘This year’s Olympics in the United Kingdom will not be immune to cyber attacks by those who would seek to disrupt the Games. ‘The Beijing Olympics saw 12 million cyber security incidents during their Olympics. ‘We have rightly been preparing for . some time - a dedicated unit will help guard the London Olympics against . cyber attack - we are determined to have a safe and secure Games.’ Despite awareness of the threat, Mr . Maude insisted that the Government would ‘resist the temptation to . over-regulate and control’ the internet, which generates around 6per . cent of UK GDP, with £3 in e-commerce exports for every £1 in imports. ‘We’re not trying to protect ourselves from the internet, which remains a massive force for good in the world,’ he said. ‘We need to protect the internet from . hostile actors - the criminals, the hackers, the terrorists - who want . to exploit it for less positive ends. Serious crime: Online offences including identity theft, phishing scams and card fraud were costing consumers billions of pounds . ‘And as we meet the challenges . presented by cyberspace, and shape its future, governments need to . resist the temptation to over regulate and control. The internet after . all has flourished precisely because it has been shaped by its users, . not by governments.’ Mr Maude said measures were being put in place to safeguard against the threat posed by cyber criminals, citing last year’s launch of the National Cyber Security Programme and the decision to rate electronic attacks a tier one UK threat to national security, with £650million allocated over four years to fund a response. And he announced that £400,000 was being committed this year to expanding the Get Safe Online campaign providing education, information and advice on internet safety. Online offences including identity theft, phishing scams and card fraud were ‘some of the fastest-growing crimes in the UK’, said Mr Maude, who has departmental responsibility for the Office for Cyber Security. ‘A recent survey showed that one in seven large organisations have been hacked in the last year, with large organisations facing one outsider attack per week; small businesses face one a month,’ he said. ‘Intellectual property theft through cyber crime is a major concern. ‘Countries and organisations across the globe are losing billions of pounds each year to cyber criminals. Resistance: Mr Maude said the Government must resist the urge to over-regulate the internet despite the increasing number of attacks origination from cyberspace . ‘UK Government networks continue to be regularly targeted by foreign intelligence agencies, or groups working on their behalf. ‘And we know that the threat is accelerating. ‘High-end cyber security solutions that were used 18 months ago by a limited number of organisations to protect their networks may already be out in the open marketplace - giving cyber criminals the knowledge to get round these protective measures. ‘Our responses have to be fast and flexible. ‘What works one day is unlikely to work a matter of months or even weeks later.’ Mr Maude was speaking to the International Centre for Defence Studies in Estonia, which is rated one of the most connected countries in the world and a pioneer in cyber security. During a three-day visit, he was also touring the Nato Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence and meeting President Toomas Hendrik Ilves and Prime Minister Andrus Ansip.","Dedicated unit set up to counter threat of cyber attacks against London Olympics .

Miraculously no one was killed in the explosion on Argyle Street, Stoke-on-Trent on Tuesday afternoon. Two people suffered minor injuries and a pregnant neighbour was taken to hospital but was later released unharmed. Rubble: The remains of the house after the explosion ripped through it on Tuesday afternoon . Mystery: The National Grid maintain there's still no evidence of a gas leak - even after the explosion . Fire crews from Hanley and Longton, the Urban Search and Rescue Unit from Greater Manchester and a team from West Midlands Fire and Rescue Service attended the incident. Initially work was halted because the building was so unstable and it was not safe to proceed. About three hours after the explosion, two sniffer dogs searched the scene but did not discover any casualties. The force of the blast was so strong, emergency crews evacuated nine homes on the same street, fearing the shock could cause them to collapse too. Resident Derek Callear, 65, said: 'I was walking down the street and suddenly I saw the whole house go up in the air. 'There was a huge cloud of smoke and rubble flying out, and I saw a man lying on the ground. 'Two people were sitting in the van parked directly outside the house; they are really lucky to be alive.' Affected: Neighbours the Qamers and the Domagalas live near to the scene of the explosion and have been left without gas or electricity . Miraculous: Emergency crews searched the rubble but found no bodies or casualties . A number of worried homeowners had called out engineers to Argyle Street on Saturday to search for the source of a strong gas smell. But they were reassured there was no sign of a leak. Mr Callear added: 'People have been reporting the smell of gas in this street for about a week. 'I called the national grid, and I know at least three of my neighbours had too, but they didn’t find anything wrong.' Another neighbour, Marie Ashton, 72, said: 'I heard this huge bang and at first I thought my washing machine had exploded. 'I went outside and everything was covered in dust.' Incredibly, tests carried out after the explosion still show no sign of a leak. A National Grid spokesman said: 'We are carrying out checks on our network but no gas has escaped in the immediate area.' The mystery has left officers at Staffordshire Police scratching their heads. Detective Inspector Steve Morrey, said: 'This type of incident is very rare. Detectives are currently investigating circumstances leading to the explosion.'","Neighbours called to complain about gas smell - but no leak was found .

A religious fanatic who thought he was Madonna's son and called himself Jesus was jailed 11 years after brutally murdering his wheelchair-bound mother. Trevor Rush, now 33, insisted that his horrific killing of 57-year-old Dorothy was 'God's work' after he stabbed the multiple sclerosis sufferer to death in May 2001. Rush murdered his mother and injured his father in a frenzied attack with a mallet and kitchen knife at their home in Norwich. Delusional: Trevor Rush, left, was jailed on Thursday for the savage murder of his mother 11 years ago, when he became convinced he was the son of Madonna, right . He has been held in a secure psychiatric clinic in the city since the savage killing, after being declared too mentally ill to plead to any charges at the time. The then 22-year-old believed he was the son of pop star Madonna and told police at the murder scene his name was Jesus Christ and Jesus Ciccone. He admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and unlawful wounding at Norwich Crown Court on Thursday. Rush was made the subject of an indefinite hospital order and taken straight back to the Norvic clinic. The frenzied attack on both his parents took place at their home in Norwich on May 6, 2001. Rush used a mallet and a kitchen knife to inflict deep neck wounds on his mother and seriously injured his father John as the 58-year-old desperately tried to save his wife's life. Grief: John Rush was at court to see his son jailed for the murder of his wife, who he tried to rescue during the vicious onslaught . Mr Rush then went to call for help from his neighbour as the brutal assault continued, leaving his deranged son standing over his mother with the mallet. Shocked police found Mrs Rush lying dead while her blood-soaked son appeared totally calm. Rush told police: 'I struck him [his father] until he repented, but the witch wouldn't so I killed her. 'I was doing God's work and I will put my faith in God.' He gave his name as Jesus Christ and Jesus Ciccone, the surname of pop star Madonna. Rush told officers to take him to a church before the police station so he could thank God for helping him. At a trial in 2002, John Rush said he had begun to worry about his son and had planned to visit his GP two days after the tragedy. Mr Rush said his son became very withdrawn after dropping out of university halfway through an engineering degree and had refused to look for work. The murder took place after Rush slapped his mother, a regular church-goer and former foster parent. He then flew into a rage and turned on his father when he tried to call police. Rush accused his father of being in collusion with Government spies and police and plotting his murder before calling his mother 'the whore of the devil'. His delusions are thought to have started around Christmas 2000. Rush grew a beard and long hair and began believing that Madonna was his mother and his real parents had fostered him.","Trevor Rush, then 22, told police his name was Jesus Christ and Jesus Ciccone .

Militant union leaders once again failed in their campaign to bring disruption to Britain after yesterday’s strikes were dismissed as a damp squib. They were expecting around 400,000 public sector workers to join the latest wave of strikes and protests over pension reforms. But ministers said the real figure was dramatically lower at 100,000 – down from the 146,000 who took part in last year’s walkout. Anger: Some 20,000 off-duty officers from all 43 forces across England and Wales are expected to take part in the first police march in the capital for more than four years . Solidarity: 16,000 off-duty officers donned black caps representing each officer expected to be lost under the Government's cull as a result of budget cuts. Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude . said the action had been futile because nearly all the key public . services remained ‘open as usual’. There was minimal disruption of the health service, border checks . continued to operate smoothly, jobcentres remained open, courts were . sitting and driving tests went ahead. Bosses at Heathrow said queues at immigration were ‘better than normal’, . despite action by passport control officers. Contingency plans to . replace them with volunteers not only averted chaos, but improved . efficiency. Mr Maude said only nine jobcentres out of 700 had closed around the . country while only four out of 407 operational courts and 97 tribunals . had been affected. Opposition: Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude described the strike as 'futile' and insisted that talks over pensions will not be reopened . The Department of Health confirmed ‘less than’ one . per cent of the NHS staff who had been expected to turn up for work . yesterday did not – and that included those who were off sick. One of the court cases to fall . victim to the strike was a triple murder trial at Maidstone Crown Court . after two out of the three defendants failed to be produced by the . Prison Service. Judge Mr Justice Sweeney had to . apologise to jurors who had turned up expecting to hear further evidence . about the case involving the deaths of three generations of one family . in an arson attack on their home in Chatham, Kent. One of those who died was Mr Muhammadi's estranged wife Melissa Crook (pictured together on their wedding day). The judge told the jury: 'Your eagle eye would see that the defendants are rather sparsely populated. 'The reason is, because of . industrial action, two male defendants have not been released by the . Prison Service to the transport service to bring them here. 'I have ordered that they be brought . here. The transport is standing by to bring them here. The trick is . getting them out of the prison to the transport.' The two defendants who were not . produced were Danai Muhammadi, 24, and Farhad Mahmud, 35, who deny three . counts of murder along with Emma Smith, 21, who was brought to court. All three also deny two counts of attempted murder. A brief spell of unofficial industrial action by prison officers was . over by lunchtime and there was no reported disruption to Probation . Services. Mr Maude said: ‘The dedicated majority of public sector workers are . working normally today and rigorous contingency plans are ensuring that . nearly all key public services remain open as usual. ‘We can confirm that far fewer civil servants are on strike than in . November – with around 100,000 taking part – down from 146,000 last . year. 'Nevertheless it is very disappointing that a handful of unions . insist on carrying on with futile action which will benefit no one.’ John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, . said: ‘By striking, public sector workers are threatening our economy . when we need every bit of growth we can get. ‘Damaging business and public sector productivity through strikes will only hurt us all.’ Union leaders insisted the strike over reforms to generous public sector . pensions had been a huge success. They claimed 200,000 civil servants, . lecturers, health workers, MoD staff, immigration, police and prison . officers had turned out. The Public and Commercial Services union said . there had been solid support for what was the third major walkout by . public sector employees in the past six months. The unions claim the reforms will leave millions of workers having to . pay more into their pensions, retiring later and receiving less. But ministers insist the current level of public sector pensions is unfair and unaffordable because people are living longer. PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka said: ‘Instead of announcing made-up . figures to undermine the strike, Francis Maude should start meaningful . negotiations about public service pensions.’ Enough is enough: Police Federation union placed this full-page adverts in several national newspapers ahead of the action today . Prison officers were reported to have walked out of 80 per cent of jails in England, Wales and Scotland, leaving only minimum cover and inmates on lockdown. However, they returned to work at lunchtime. Around 30,000 off-duty police officers marched through Westminster to protest about changes to pay and conditions. Officers, who are banned from striking by law, face cuts to overtime and bonus payments, a later retirement age and less lavish pensions. Police on sit-down strike: Police have been banned from striking since 1919 when almost every constable and sergeant refused to go on duty, causing havoc in London and Liverpool . The last police strike: Police strikers sitting on the garden wall at 10 Downing Street in 1919 where a strike deputation was received by Prime Minister Lloyd George . Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘The . hardliners scream blue murder about reformed pensions that give public . sector workers far better deals than the vast majority of people in this . country can access.’ Militant union leaders are secretly urging fuel tanker drivers to reject . their latest pay and safety standards deal in a plot to cause a summer . of disruption. A cabal of firebrands inside the union is pressuring drivers to vote for . a strike that will cause forecourts to run dry and are likely to . coincide with the Olympics and Queen’s Diamond Jubilee. The Mail has . seen leaflets sent to members urging them to vote against a generous . package approved by independent arbitration service Acas, even though it . meets their demands for a health and safety review. Police officers across the UK are currently banned from taking strike action or joining a union under the Police Act 1996. The ban has been in place since 1919 when the first police act was established following two strikes in Liverpool and London. Complaining that pay for the average constable in a provincial force was £2.75 per week, the same as a street sweeper, almost every constable and sergeant refused to go on duty. Their demands included a pay rise, . improved war bonuses, extension of pension rights to include policemen's . widows and an allowance for school-aged children. Then Prime Minister David Lloyd . George, gave in on pay, but within months the union was . crushed and the Police Federation founded. It . is not a union, but has a statutory responsibility to represent its . members - all officers below the rank of superintendent - in all matters . affecting their welfare and efficiency. The few forms of industrial action police can legally take is a work-to-rule, which could severely hit the service, and withdraw from voluntary posts, such as policing football matches. Other professions have agreements over strike action but, unlike the police, are not banned by law. Nurses . can legally strike but the Royal College of Nursing, which represents . two thirds of British nurses, has a ruling that they should only walk . out where it would not affect the wellbeing or interests of patients.

A Dutch entrepreneur has offered couples the chance of a weekend away with a difference - by staying in a hotel where he will help them finalise their divorce. Jim Halfen's 'Divorce Hotel' allows pairs intent on breaking up to get quick divorces by staying for two days in their accommodation and coming out as two all-but-separated people. The Netherlands-based firm aim to talk couples through alimony, splitting assets, visitation rights for children and any other outstanding marital issues to help finalise a divorce. Scroll down for video . Heartbreak Hotel: The Carlton Ambassador hotel in Hague, Netherlands - one of several locations Jim Halfens uses as part of his 'Divorce Hotel' concept . Their two-day process of drawing together documentation by having the two parties, lawyers, and mediators all in the same hotel for a weekend aims to quicken a process which can normally be drawn out for weeks or months. The concept was created by Jim Halfens, whose website says the company offers 'an affordable 5-star divorce made-to-measure'. Mr Halfens uses high-end hotels around the country, putting up the couple in separate rooms (if they wish) and providing mediators and legal advice for a set fee. Once the divorcing couple leave the hotel at the end of their stay, the only thing left to do is show the agreement to a judge, as required in Dutch law, which can take a couple of weeks. The company assesses couples when they apply for the service, to make sure they are suitable for the process and not caught up in a bitter dispute. It then ensures both parties' wellbeing during the stay. Brainchild: Entrepreneur Jim Halfens came up with the Divorce Hotel concept after witnessing a college friend go through a particularly messy break-up . Mr Halfens said he was inspired to create the company after watching a college friend go through a painful separation. He told the New York Times: 'He was losing weight, he was unable to have fun in life anymore and they were fighting every time you saw them — it was horrible. 'The divorce negotiations dragged on for five months. I was convinced there has to be another way.' Sales manager Ninke Bons told Sky News: 'We treat them as any other guests, we just try to keep a closer eye on them or make sure they are not wandering around by themselves. All over: The Dutch firm promises 'an affordable, five-star divorce made-to measure' 'Just as an example - we would normally enquire if a guest enjoyed their stay at the hotel. Well, obviously that's not very appropriate in the case of the Divorce Hotel.' The idea has become so popular that several television companies in America are looking at making it into a documentary series. Mr Halfens is also looking to expand into other countries, suggesting that the USA and Germany could be next on the list.","Dutch firm promises 'an affordable 5-star divorce made-to-measure'.

A novice driver was killed when she misread her satnav and drove into the path of oncoming traffic on a dual carriageway. Inexperienced Lauren Smee collided head-on collision with a BMW after driving the wrong way down a slip road after she misunderstood the satnav's instruction to take the first left exit on a roundabout. Failing to spot the 'no entry' signs, the 21-year-old ended up driving against the traffic flow on a 70mph road, directly into the path of driver Stuart Hope-Kirk. At an inquest into Miss Smee's death, Mr Hope-Kirk told the coroner's court he had 'absolutely no time' to react. West Sussex Coroner's Court was told that Miss Smee, who had only been behind the wheel for three months, had set off for a friend’s house in darkness on December 11 last year. On her 16-mile journey she came to a roundabout near Worthing, West Sussex, where her satnav told her to take the first left turn and she drove straight into the path of oncoming traffic. West Sussex Coroner’s Court was told Miss Smee’s Ford Ka collided head-on with Stuart Hope-Kirk’s convertible BMW on the 70mph road. Miss Smee, a barmaid from nearby Chichester, died that night at Worthing Hospital while Mr Hope-Kirk suffered a broken ankle and fractured spine. Mr Hope-Kirk, 49, from Bexhill: 'I saw what looked like strong headlights coming towards me. 'They were on my side of the dual carriageway. There was absolutely no time for me to react.' After the accident PC Stuart Medlycott, from Sussex Police, used a satnav to follow the same route Lauren had taken. Wrong turn: The inquest heard how Miss Smee could have missed the no entry signs at the roundabout slip road (pictured) He added: 'The device said cross the roundabout at the first exit, the first lawful exit being Titnore Lane. 'The signage on the exit slip road is quite high so if you missed the two signs on the flyover bridge you may miss those. 'If Lauren was unfamiliar with that junction she may have had a momentary lapse in her concentration.' He added once Miss Smee was on the A27 she may have thought she was travelling the correct way along a single-carriageway. The Highways Agency have since improved signage at the junction. However Miss Smee's mother Penny, 45, is calling for young drivers to be trained in using satnavs to stop a similar tragedy happening again. Avoidable accident: Miss Smee's mother is calling for young drivers to be trained in using satnavs to stop a similar tragedy happening again . She said after the inquest: 'She was going to pick her friend up but did not know where she was going. 'She heard the voice of the satnav and took it literally. She was a very inexperienced driver. 'Satnavs are a help to youngsters on the road who don’t know where they are going but young drivers have so much to think about. 'If they are following the sat-nav they can’t always be aware of the road. If they sat-nav tells you to get off there you just think it’s telling you the right thing. 'She believed she was doing the right thing and didn’t question it. I think the use of sat-navs should be included in some way in driving lessons. 'Young people need to be taught how to use them safely. Maybe it would stop a tragedy like this happening again.' Mrs Smee added: 'She was such a beautiful person, inside and out.' Miss Smee attended Chichester College before going to work at the The Bull’s Head pub in Fishbourne, West Sussex.

Eight-hour battle: Forty-stone Russell Parkin was rescued from his flat days after Britain's fattest teen Georgia Davis (pictured) was freed in similar cicrumstances in a £100,000 operation . Seventeen firefighters and paramedics battled for eight hours to free a 40-stone man after he fell ill at home. Russell Parkin, 41, was dragged downstairs from his second-floor flat in a giant bowl-shaped 'sledge' by 15 men before being lifted into a reinforced ambulance. Two doors had to be removed so he could be squeezed outside, screened by a tarpaulin for privacy. Paramedics were called to Mr Parkin's home in New Eltham, South East London, at around 8pm on Saturday, but had to draft in the fire service for extra help. It wasn't until 4am when neighbours said they were woken by the sound of the sled bumping down the stairs. A neighbour told The Sun how the former security worker had ballooned recently after living on a diet of Indian takeaways and food delivered by Tesco. They said: 'He struggled to get anywhere. He needed a five-minute rest after climbing the first of two flights of steps to his flat.' Another neighbour said the emergency workers weren't sure how to get Mr Parkin out, adding: 'They wanted to remove his front window and have him lifted out. 'But they said they'd need to remove the brickwork underneath too as it would be impossible to lift him over that.' Mr Russell, who lives with his girlfriend Lorraine Ward, 41, was yesterday believed to be in a nearby hospital, although his condition was unknown. The rescue comes days after 63st Georgia Davis was freed in a £100,000 operation in which the walls of her home had to be knocked down. Georgia, dubbed Britain's fattest teen, was winning her fight for life yesterday after a spate of medical problems brought on by her weight. Huge resources: The operation to free Georgia from her home in Aberdare, South Wales, is thought to have cost around £100,000 . The 19-year-old is in a 'stable condition' after doctors gave her emergency treatment for a series of obesity-related ailments. After four days on a specialist ward, she is recovering well and getting over the trauma of being cut from her bedroom.

And she been inundated with messages of support from well wishers around the world who are urging her to beat over food demons. A spokesperson for the hospital said: 'Georgia is still undergoing investigations and receiving treatment from a range of health professionals. 'We are pleased to advise that her clinical condition is stable.' Today, it emerged that she had moved away from home in a desperate bid to lose weight. She started a new life on a healthier diet by sharing a flat with a friend. But a friend said Georgia returned home to look after her sick stepfather. Neighbour . Friend Jade Tarrant, 19, said Georgia was just 18st after going to fat camp and how she wanted to have more control over her diet away from home. Jade said: 'I always knew it was going to get this bad if she went home again. 'She’d came to live with me because of all the stress. Being with the mum and her step dad got so stressful. 'She just wanted a break - she wanted to some girly time. She would have lost weight if she stayed with me because I like my salads and I could have got her on it. 'But she missed her mum and stepdad. She ended up going back and putting her own health at risk.'

Gardeners are being forced to burn their own lawns in a bid to get rid of an infestation of 'toxic' caterpillars causing severe allergic reactions. Thousands of brown-tailed moth caterpillars are said to have descended on a railway embankment near a residential road in Alphington, Exeter, Devon. Some have suffered rashes and other allergic reactions to the small creatures, and have had to take drastic action to keep them out of their gardens. Drastic measures: Jay Taylor, from Alphington, Exeter, had to burn down large parts of his back garden to keep the brown-tailed moth caterpillars at bay . Threat: The brown-tailed moth caterpillars are covered in small hairs which can cause allergic reactions, skin irritations, headaches and breathing problems . The brown-tailed moth caterpillar is said to be native to the UK, but is found in larger numbers at this time of year . The insects are covered in small hairs which can break off easily in a light breeze and cause an allergic reaction, rashes and, in severe cases, asthma attacks. Residents have since taken the severe course of burning their own trees and gardens in an attempt to deprive the caterpillars of food and keep them away. Jay Taylor, a resident of Willeys Avenue, in Alphington, Exeter, Devon, said thousands of the brown-tailed moth caterpillars can be found along the railway embankment running behind Alphington Road. He said: 'I have welts all down my arms and legs - it looks as though I have got chicken pox.' Infested: The small insects have taken over a railway embankment in Alphington, Exeter, leading some people to suffer allergic reactions which put them in hospital . Experts have said they are seeing more and more of the small pests in Britain, particularly in the south of England . 'These caterpillars are everywhere, they seem to be on everything. 'One neighbour shook a bush in his garden and about 500 dropped out - it really is no joking matter. 'I have a baby daughter and I am worried for her so our garden, which was full of flowers, is now just mud as I have burnt every tree, plant and shrub so the caterpillars have nothing to eat.' Last year an infestation made life misery for residents living alongside the railway embankment in nearby St Thomas. The infestations are not just confined to Devon, as millions of the larvae of the have again started emerging to festoon the branches of trees and shrubs in New Addington, near Croydon, Surrey . The invasion in Surrey comes a year after a similar plague saw two people end up needing emergency treatment in hospital and several more suffering from breathing difficulties. Woodland information website woodlands.co.uk states that brown-tailed moth caterpillars, which are native to the UK, are normally found on hedgerow trees such as blackthorn and hawthorn and scrubby plants. Severe measures: Jay Taylor, pictured with his partner Helen and daughter Olivia, burned down parts of his garden after becoming worried about the caterpillars' effect on his family . Harmful: A resident in Alphington, who did not want to be named, shows off the extensive rash on their arm which they say was caused by a brown-tailed moth caterpillar . The site says that local councils have addressed the problem of brown tail moth infestations by using pheromone traps. The traps release a ‘scent’ that attracts males, and therefore interferes with the normal breeding cycle. Network Rail has written to residents saying that the vegetation along the bank will be sprayed and removed but Mr Taylor believes that the only way to deal with the infestation is with fire. He said: 'The only way to get rid of them is to burn what they are on.' Mr Taylor added: 'I saw one chap who had a caterpillar land on his neck. 'He ended up in hospital because his neck swelled up.' Local authorities have warned that the brown-tailed moth can hide in winter months in silkens tents which can hold up to 2,000 of the creatures. Network Rail has advised residents to stay away from the embankment while the spraying and removal is undertaken and apologised for any inconvenience. A spokesman for the city council said: 'Over the last few years brown tail moth infestations have increased, especially in the southern parts of the UK. 'I understand Network Rail has carried out two treatments in recent weeks along the embankment and intends to carry out further treatment if necessary.'","Brown-tailed moth caterpillars can cause headaches, rashes, and other allergic reactions .

Sir Martin Sorrell and his wife Cristiana: He may face having his £13million pay deal slashed after a shareholder revolt . The British boss of the world’s biggest advertising firm has been dealt a humiliating blow in the largest pay revolt of the current ‘shareholder spring’. Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of advertising giant WPP, faces having his proposed £13million pay package cut after some 60 per cent of shareholders refused to back the reward. The rebellion at the company’s annual general meeting in Dublin is the biggest against a FTSE 100 company’s remuneration report since regulations giving shareholders a vote were introduced in 2002. Investors also staged large votes  against the re-election of the chairman, and the head of WPP’s pay committee. Three of the firm’s biggest shareholders are thought to have voted down the pay proposals and shareholder advisory group ISS, which has 20 per cent of investors as clients, has not backed it. The advertising agency is now under pressure to revise the £13million package it proposed for Sir Martin, which includes long-term share awards that bore fruit last year and a 30 per cent basic salary rise to £1.3million. Under stock market rules, votes against Sir Martin’s pay and that of other executives are merely ‘advisory’, meaning shareholders cannot force bosses to slash their pay. But a series of votes last month against the pay of other chief executives, including Sly Bailey of Trinity Mirror and Andrew Moss at Aviva, has seen some turfed out of their jobs. Business Secretary Vince Cable is considering proposals to hand shareholders an annual binding vote on executive pay. Annual meetings are normally sober occasions that focus on the previous year’s performance. But WPP took the extraordinary step of mounting a two-hour presentation in praise of Sir Martin’s achievements during his 26-year tenure at the helm of the company. Despite the praise heaped on him by his colleagues, Sir Martin’s expression remained thunderous and the rest of the board scowled for the duration of the meeting. About 150 shareholders attended the event in Ireland, where the British firm moved to enjoy the simpler tax regime for companies. The vote against the pay package is not binding and does not force WPP to reset its pay policy for 2011. However the board will now have to reconsider the package in light of the protest vote. Veteran boss: Despite a two hour presentation in . praise of Sir Martin's leadership, 60 per cent of WPP shareholders . voted against his pay package at the firm's AGM . WPP chairman Philip Lader, a former White House deputy chief of staff, told the meeting: ‘We take the remuneration report vote very seriously. We’ll consult with many share owners and will then move forward in the best interests of our share owners and our business.’ Guy Jubb, of Standard Life Investments, which holds just under two per cent of WPP shares, said: ‘The message from shareholders was unambiguous. It cannot be ignored.’ Sir Martin yesterday said: ‘It’s a democracy and the shareholders have spoken, it’s their right.’ But when asked whether he was considering his position in the light of the pay vote, he was unrepentant, pointing out that 98 per cent of shareholders had voted for his re-election in a separate poll. A quarter of investors refused to back the re-election of Jeffrey Rosen, the chairman of the pay committee. Mr Rosen said ‘The board remains committed to paying for performance,’ adding that he had consulted with shareholders but ‘there was a diversity of opinion’. The Institute of Directors (IoD) rounded on Sir Martin’s pay last night citing problems of excessive pay at large companies.

Roger Barker, head of corporate governance at the IoD, said: ‘I do think this vote is the right outcome. ‘Sir Martin Sorrell should really sit down and think about the lessons of this vote and the concerns of shareholders.’ Sir Martin, who founded WPP in 1985 and has invested and co-invested millions into the company, has defended the deal as reflective of his performance, after the group reported bottom-line profits of £1billion for the first time in 2011. His pay package is made up of £1.3million salary, £2million annual bonus, £3million deferred shares and other benefits. On top of the annual remuneration, he received nearly £6million in shares last year. These were awarded in 2006 and were closely-tied to performance targets, pension contributions and more than £1.3million in dividend equivalents. Shareholder advisory groups, including the Association of British Insurers, and Pensions Investment Research Consultants, last week urged members not to back the advertising group’s ‘excessive’ remuneration report. Writing in the Financial Times last week, Sir Martin warned if Britain wanted high achievers in the private sector, it needed to pay competitively. He said: ‘The compensation debate in the UK now seems to have shifted from undeserving bankers paid for failure to what is fair pay.’","60 per cent of shareholders voted against WPP chief Sir Martin Sorrell's pay package .

Shafilea Ahmed's decomposed remains were discovered in Cumbria in 2004 and her parents are now on trial for her murder . Shafilea Ahmed's sister today denied telling a friend she should 'give police her diaries' if anything happened to her after she was arrested on suspicion of stealing from the family home. Mevish Ahmed, 21, also told the jury she had not told Shahin Munir that her parents had threatened to kill her. Her parents Iftikhar Ahmed, 52, and his wife Farzana, 49, are standing trial accused of killing their daughter Shafilea at home in Warrington, . Cheshire, in September 2003. The trial has already heard from their second child, Alesha, that they hit Shafilea and then suffocated her with a plastic bag in . front of the other children. But taking to the stand at Chester Crown Court yesterday, Mevish said an account of the teenager being murdered by their strict Muslim parents was 'fiction'. She was 12 at the time her older sister disappeared. Today she denied that she had ever been beaten by her parents - and said she had merely fallen outside the house as she gave evidence for a second day. Andrew Edis QC, prosecuting, told the jury about an incident in April 2009 when she was arrested on suspicion of stealing money from the family home. He said: 'You spoke to Shahin and told her that afterwards you were beaten by your mother and your father, thrown on the floor and they said that you should go to Pakistan right now and talked about finishing you and threatened to kill you.' Miss Ahmed replied: 'No, I fell outside the house.' The prosecution claims that Miss Ahmed had fallen out with her parents but 'returned to the family' after they promised to withdraw the theft allegation. Mr Edis said: 'You had been arrested and investigated for the theft of £600 from your own house and you said (to Miss Munir), ""I'm going back home, if anything happens to me give police the diary"".' Miss Ahmed replied: 'I don't recall that at all.' On trial: Iftikhar Ahmed, left, and Farzana Ahmed, right, are alleged to have killed their 17-year-old daughter because she refused to obey them . Yesterday, the jury heard extracts of writings made by Miss Ahmed and given to Miss Munir which appeared to corroborate statements her sister Alesha earlier made to the court about Shafilea's treatment by her parents and the night of her death. Evidence: Mevish Ahmed, sister of Shafilea Ahmed, today denied telling her friend to hand her diaries to police if anything happened to her . Miss Ahmed described the documents as 'free writing' and said they were all pieces of 'fiction'. The accounts were written by Mevish in . 2008 and given to a friend, Shahin Munir, Chester Crown Court heard. Prosecutor Andrew Edis suggested that if the documents had a title, it . would be: ‘How my parents killed my sister.’ In one extract, Mevish says: ‘Three times she ran but they got her.’ A second extract read to the court included the sentences: ‘She didn’t do nothing. Shouting, time after time. What did she do? ‘That’s it, space of one to two minutes – gone.’ Alesha, . the chief prosecution witness, has told the jury that Shafilea . repeatedly ran away from home to escape the violence she claims their . parents meted out. She also told how in September 2003 . her parents pushed Shafilea on to the settee in their house in . Warrington, Cheshire. The couple then forced a plastic bag into the . teenager’s mouth and suffocated her in front of the other children, she . said. Alesha told of watching the couple . sorting through bin bags and rolls of tape after the alleged killing – . before seeing her father leave the house carrying a dark package. Mr Edis suggested to Mevish that her writings ‘look like an allegation of murder against your parents’. But she replied: ‘No, it is not based on me or my family. It is just chat – just random stuff.’ She also described her writings as ‘just a story’ and added: ‘I used the names but that doesn’t mean it is about us.’ Mevish met Miss Munir in a park in . August 2008 – when she had a drug problem – the court heard. Miss Munir . wrote a record of what she said Mevish told her. This was read to the . jury. It began: ‘They sat her down in a chair and her Dad went mad. Family home: The Ahmeds lived in this house in Warrington, Cheshire. Shafilea's remains were discovered in Cumbria in 2004 . ‘He started proper hitting her. Mevish tried to stop it but her Mum pushed her away. ‘They used the plastic bag to suffocate her and one or two minutes, she was gone.’ Mevish insisted to the court the account was fiction or ‘free writing’. She admitted asking Miss Munir to return the documents but said her friend had kept photocopies. Earlier she denied witnessing her parents killing her sister.

The BBC today faced being pulled into another racism row after a football expert at Euro 2012 made a 'casually racist' remark about a fan dressed in a head-to-toe black morph body suit. Expert pundit Mark Lawrenson had been commentating on Germany's match against Portugal on Saturday evening when BBC cameras panned to a fan dressed completely in a tight black suit. As the fan appeared on screen, veteran pundit Lawrenson joked that the black-costumed spectator looked like Eric 'the Eel' Moussambani, a black swimmer who shot to fame at the Sydney Olympics in 2000. Scroll down for video . Unique: A fan in the Germany Portugal game looked on wearing a full morph body suit and purple sunglasses . The 'crass' remark was quickly pounced on by dozens of football fans watching the coverage, who took to Twitter to express their amazement that the 55-year-old co-commentator had made such a comment. Lawrenson had joked: 'That Eric the Eel, isn't it, sitting at the front?' as the fan appeared on screen, before BBC cameras cut back to the action. One user posted soon after the comment: 'The ""eric the eel"" comment was particularly crass, even by his usual inane standards.' Ill-judged: Lawrenson claimed the remark was a reference to the lycra suits Eric the Eel himself used to wear, but many Twitter users took the comment differently . Another poster on Twitter said: 'I still can’t get over Lawro’s ‘Eric The Eel’ comment. After all this talk of racism in Ukraine.' Minutes later another user of the micro blogging site said: 'Just checking, but did (Mark) lawrenson did just throw in some casual racism about a guy in a black lycra suit, calling him eric the eel?' Star: Equatorial Guinea swimmer Eric Moussembani became an overnight sensation after his spectacularly slow performance at the Sydney Olympics . The BBC today insisted the comment was 'in no way meant to be offensive', as Lawrenson had been making reference to occasions when Moussambani had also swam wearing a lycra suit. But many Twitter users saw the remark differently, with one even calling for Lawrenson to be 'taken off the TV'. The ill-judged remarks also came just months after Lawrenson's Match of the Day colleague Alan Hansen was forced to apologise for using the word 'coloured'. In a discussion of the controversies surrounding England captain John Terry and Liverpool striker Luis Suarez, Hansen used the word as he praised the achievements of black players in the Premier League. But many viewers objected to the term – considered offensive because it dismisses everyone who is not white as the same – and the Corporation received more than 100 complaints over the incident. 'Eric the Eel' became an overnight sensation at Sydney 2000 when he slowly made his way through a 100 metres freestyle heat. Having never swum competitively in a 50-metre pool, Moussambani flagged near the end of his solo heat and appeared to almost sink as he approached the finish. His finishing time of 1:52.72, was the slowest seen at an Olympics and more than a minute behind the world record. But he received a standing ovation and instant fame as reporters dubbed him ‘Eric the Eel’. A BBC spokesperson commenting on Lawrenson's remark said: 'Mark Lawrenson commented on a man dressed in an all in one swimsuit which was similar to those worn by Eric the Eel. This was clearly not meant to cause offence.'","Veteran pundit made ill-judged on-air remark during Germany v Portugal .

Now, it seems, Vladimir Guerrero is trying to continue that legacy by producing a team of his very own. For the ex-Angels right fielder has revealed he has fathered eight children by five different baby-mamas. Hats off to you: Major League Baseball star Vladimir Guerrero has fathered eight children by five different women, costing him $25,000 in child support, legal documents have revealed . The 37-year-old has been forced to divulge his finances after a new paternity lawsuit was filed against him by one of the mothers, Heidy Ogando, it was reported on TMZ. Legal documents show the child support is costing him an eye-watering $25,621 a month, which works out at more than $300,000 a year. Given that he no longer has a Major League contract (he is currently playing with the Toronto Blue Jays), his offspring could leave him with a real financial headache. But with more than $25million of stocks and bonds built up over his 16-year career, the outlay is unlikely to break the bank any time soon. Fearsome hitter: Guerrero, seen here in action for the Baltimore Orioles last year, has built up a $25million fortune during his glittering career . Baby Mama 1 (one child): $5,237 .

Very little has been known about Guerrero's private life until now. One of nine children, he is the younger brother of ex-major leaguer Wilton Guerrero and the cousin of minor league player Cristian Guerrero. Guerrero made his Major League debut for the Montreal Expos in September 1996 and went on to be honoured with the League's Most Valuable player award in 2004. A nine-time All Star, he helped lead the Angels to five American League West championships and was voted one of the most feared hitters in baseball in a 2008 poll of all 30 Major League managers.

Left an emotional wreck: Black steel worker Elijah Turley (not pictured) has been awarded $25million in damages after suffering years of racist abuse at the hands of his fellow employees at a plant in Buffalo, U.S (file image) A federal jury has awarded $25million in damages to a U.S. steel plant employee who says his bosses at Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal failed to stop years of racial taunts and insults from co-workers. A jury yesterday found ArcelorMittal and some of its former executives responsible for the treatment of Elijah Turley at the company's Buffalo, New York-area steel plant, which closed in 2009. Turley, who is black, testified that 'KKK' was written on the walls of the plant and a stuffed monkey with a noose around its neck was found hanging from his driver's side mirror. 'It's absolutely shocking that a case like this is in court in 2012,' said Turley's lawyer, Ryan J. Mills, in his closing argument, it was reported in the Buffalo News. 'It should be viewed as atrocious and intolerable in a civilized society.' The jury's unanimous decision followed a three-week trial,where African-American Turley testified about a series of incidents from 2005 to 2008  which left him a physical and emotional wreck and forever changed his life. The payout was intended to either punish the company or deter it from engaging in similar conduct, the court heard. Turley, a processor operator in the plant's pickler department, and others told of instances where he was called 'monkey' or 'boy.' In his court papers, Turley offered a chronology of events that included the stuffed monkey hanging from his car in the plant parking lot and the 'KKK' graffiti written on chalk inside the facility. Mills told the jury: 'This case is about the breakdown of a man. He wanted to be treated equally, treated equally in a culture that hadn't changed since the 1950s.' Lawyers for ArcelorMittal say the company took steps to halt the harassment, including suspending employees involved. But the jury found ArcelorMittal liable for allowing a 'hostile work environment' to exist and for the 'intentional infliction of emotional distress'. 'We are astonished by today's decision and consider the compensatory and punitive damages figure excessive,' ArcelorMittal said in a statement. ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steel maker by sales, was found liable for all,  but a small percentage of the $25million award. The company has not commented on whether it will appeal.","Elijah Turley was left an emotional and physical wreck .

The ranger who plunged more than 3,000 feet to his death yesterday while helping rescue four injured climbers down a crevasse has been pictured. Mount Rainier ranger Nick Hall was helping to prepare the climbers to be taken off the 14,411-foot Cascade Range peak when he fell before shortly before 5pm, said Mount Rainier National Park spokesman Kevin Bacher. Mr Bacher said Mr Hall, 34, didn't respond to attempts to contact him and was not moving, and he was dead when other rangers reached him at the 10,000-foot level several hours later. Tragedy: Ranger Nick Hall, 34, was helping prepare the climbers to be taken from the 14,411-ft Washington state peak when he fell . Life: Mr Hall worked as an avalanche forecaster, ski patroller, climbing ranger and in the U.S. Marines Corps according to his Facebook page . Park officials notified relatives and other rangers before announcing Mr Hall's death late Thursday. A . Chinook helicopter from Joint Base Lewis-McChord plucked three of the . injured climbers off the mountain Thursday night while one member of the . party from Waco, Texas, remained overnight, waiting out a worsening . storm in the company of park rangers. Bacher . says all four had injuries that were not life-threatening. The two . rescued from the mountain were taken to a hospital. None was immediately . identified. Worsening visibility and 40 mph winds kept rescuers from removing the other two climbers late Thursday. Storms on Mount Rainier are notoriously fierce and obstinate with severe winter-like storms said to not be uncommon during the summer months, according to the National Park Service. 'We were lucky to get two off the mountain' the spokesman said. About . 10,000 people attempt to summit the massive volcano each year, with . most doing so in the summer. Only a few hundred climb the iconic . mountain in the winter. Rescue attempt: The two men and two women were caught on a crevasse of Mt Rainier, pictured, after falling during a storm that sent 40 MPH winds . The Texas climbers were roped together when they fell on Emmons Glacier. The two women at the end of the rope ended up in a crevasse. Rangers who responded to a cell phone call helped them out of the crevasse. Mr Hall, who was unmarried and without children, is originally from Patten, Maine, the park spokesman said. He attended Western State College of . Colorado and worked as a ski patroller at Stevens Pass, an avalanche . forecaster at Yellowstone National Park and also served in the U.S. Marines Corps according to his Facebook page. Tragic year: Mr Hall is the second ranger to die on the job this year at the park, with the first killed on New Year's Day after shot by a guest . The Seattle Times reports Hall had been with Mount Rainier National Park's climbing program for four years. His death comes during what has already proven a difficult year for park staff. On New Year's Day, Mount Rainier Ranger Margaret Anderson was fatally shot as she tried to stop a man who drove through a tire chain checkpoint near Longmire . The 24-year-old man, Benjamin Colton Barnes, was suspected in a shooting early New Year's Day in Seattle, and his body was found the next day about a mile away in the snow. Mr Hill is the third climbing ranger to die during service at the park and the seventh person this year, The Olympian reports.","Ranger Nick Hall was helping to prepare climbers to be airlifted off the 14,411-foot Cascade Range peak .

Stressful events such as moving house or the death of a loved one could lead people to develop dementia, researchers have suggested. Experts have been investigating the role stress plays in causing Alzheimer's, and claim that certain 'traumatic experiences' are factors in developing the condition. The study, being led by Professor Clive Holmes at the University of Southampton, will monitor 140 people aged over 50 with mild cognitive impairment during an 18-month period. Traumatic experiences such as the death of a loved one or moving house could develop Alzheimers, experts have claimed . The participants will be assessed for levels of stress and any progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. About 60 per cent of people with mild cognitive impairment are known to go on to develop Alzheimer's. Prof Holmes said: 'All of us go through stressful events. We are looking to understand how these may become a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's. Moving house could be 'a potential factor' in causing Alzheimers . 'Something such as bereavement or a traumatic experience - possibly even moving home - is also a potential factor. 'This is the first stage in developing ways in which to intervene with psychological or drug-based treatments to fight the disease.

A cowboy builder charged a couple £49,000 to convert their home so they could start fostering and then turned it into a ‘deathtrap’. William White left Simon and Rachel Ballamy's house in Devon in such a state after seven months of work that they had to spend another £40,000 on having it fixed and made safe. Having remortgaged their house to cover the spiralling costs, they can now no longer afford to go ahead with fostering. 'Shoddy results': Simon and Rachel Ballamy, left, were horrified when William White, right, left their home in chaos after seven months' work . 'Shoddy': The work left the house a 'deathtrap', with one light switch turning on a bulb elsewhere in the home . The judge at Plymouth Crown Court said the 'cowboy' builder had left electricals in a life-threatening condition had that it was only through luck that disaster had been been averted. He said that the accountant's ‘meddling’ in a building firm was a ‘grievous mistake and catastrophically wrong’, and that he gave good builders a bad name. The 51-year-old and his estranged former partner Jayne Thompson, 50, both avoided immediate jail terms yesterday when they were sentenced. Recorder Sean Levene told White, from Exeter, Devon: 'You did not have a clue what you were doing.' His work was so ‘shoddy’ that the Ballamys ordered them off site after seven months of chaos. 'Effectively that property was left as a deathtrap,' said Mr Levene. White and Thompson also admitted claiming VAT even though their Exeter-based company Eaglerock Associates Ltd was not VAT registered - which it should have been. Unfinished business: The company has gone into liquidation, so the Ballamys have not had any money back after paying to redo work on the door to the lounge, left, and the hallway, right . 'Unsafe': The Ballamys paid £40,000 to redo White's work, and can now no longer afford to foster as they had planned . The court heard they defrauded their clients and pocketed the cash. The judge said the jury rejected Thompson’s claims at trial that she was ‘naive’ and a ‘stooge’ in White's scheme. Despite branding the Ballamy’s bungalow in Newton Abbot a death trap, the judge said that ‘no harm was caused to anybody through your own bit of luck’. Legally aided White and Thompson, who manages a number of properties, face paying sizeable financial compensation to the victims plus £25,000 court costs and their own defence, with the judge saying it should not ‘cost the State a penny’. White admitted breaching professional diligence with the shoddy state of the electrical work and two counts of fraud relating to £6,500 ‘VAT’ fees. He was jailed for nine months, suspended for 12 months and ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work. His ex partner was jailed for six months, suspended for 12 months, and told to carry out 120 hours of unpaid work. Under construction: The eaves, left and master bedroom's en-suite, right, at the house in Devon were left in a mess after seven months of work . The ‘work’ to convert the property began in February 2009 until the 'builders' were ordered off the site in August that year. 'Naive': The judge refused to accept White's ex-partner Jayne Thompson's claim that she was a 'stooge' in his plans . A county court ordered the defendants to pay back £49,000 but their company has gone into liquidation without a penny being paid - so far. He also banned them from being directors of any company for ten years - even though they are both already banned until 2018. Devon Trading Standards prosecutor David Sapiecha said the electrical work could have proved fatal to the owners and threatened the building. He described it as ‘very poor quality work’, with wires were left sticking out of floors and construction work half complete. One light switch turned on a light in a different part of the house, which the judge said was ‘funny when it happens in films’. 'It was dangerous, it was a death trap,' said the judge. White’s defence lawyer Ian Dixie said . his client was 'not responsible for the electrical work’ which he . accepted was ‘thoroughly incompetent’. The accountant had charged the Ballamys just £2,000 for it, with Mr Levene commenting: 'If you pay peanuts you get monkeys.' The judge told the lawyer he was carrying out a ‘conjuring trick to make the £6,500 VAT vanish’ by claiming it was only the taxman who had lost out in the fraud. After the case the Ballamys, both 37, said they were ‘happy’ with the sentences. Mobility advisor Mr Ballamy said: 'Our lives have been turned upside down. Our finance plan is ten years from where it was.' Mrs Ballamy added: 'White knew about the fostering because he said he would reflect it in the £49,000 price. 'We cannot afford to foster now. In effect we had to pay twice to get the house done. And it is not completely finished yet. This has been going on for four years.' White and Thompson tried to cover their faces as they entered court with a group of associates who said ‘result’ as the judge passed sentence. But outside White approached two other female victims who told him: 'You took my money, you have no heart, you tell lies.' He replied: 'Take me to court.'","Couple ordered William White off their property after seven months of chaos .

A California jury decided that a former police detective and veteran, who claimed temporary insanity saying that he raped a waitress at gunpoint because he was on the antidepressant Zoloft, was in fact sane at the time of the abduction. Jurors delivered their findings in the case of 32-year-old Anthony Nicholas Orban on Tuesday in San Bernardino County Superior Court. The former Westminster police detective was previously convicted of raping a waitress in a brutal attack that began outside a mall in 2010. Insane: Anthony Orban, 33, claims that his anti-depressants and PTSD lead to him having a temporary break from reality during the 2003 rape . The details of the grim crime came out . throughout the trial, telling how he allegedly raped a woman and texted . pictures of his victim to a friend while he spent two hours beating and . choking her. Orban's attorney had argued that his . client could not be held responsible for his actions because he was . taking the antidepressant Zoloft, which had rendered him effectively . unconscious at the time of the attack. He . also brought his military service into the mix, claiming that the . combination of his post-traumatic stress disorder following his tour of . duty and an over-prescription of the anti-depressant made him kidnap and . rape the woman. Orban is now awaiting his sentencing, and may face a life sentence. Victims of sexual assault are not publicly identified so her name and age are not known, but she was allegedly forced into her car at gunpoint by Orban in the middle of the day on April 3, 2010 when she was leaving her job at the Ontario Mills Mall. During what his lawyer described as a 'psychotic break from reality', Orban forced the woman to drive to a remote area of a Fontana business park. Accomplice: Orban reportedly texted photos to his high school friend Jeff Thomas Jelinek (pictured) with the caption 'Look what I'm doing' There, Orban proceeded to rape, beat, choke and threaten to kill the woman for two hours. The Orange County Register . reports that during that time, Orban, who had no prior criminal record, . texted photos to his high school friend Jeff Thomas Jelinek with the . caption 'Look what I'm doing'. While he was distracted for a moment, the woman was able to get out of the car and run to a nearby liquor store where she asked the store clerk to call the police. Jelinek, 33, a former state prison guard, is also charged in the crime, but because he was not physically present at the time of the attack, his charges are less significant than Orban's, also 33. After the woman ran off, Orban stole her keys and told Jelinek to pick him up nearby. Pals: High school friends Orban (left) and Jelinek (right) supposedly spent the day before the attack together, drinking heavily . In his haste, he left his police-issued gun, which had his name written on the barrel, a dislodged bullet, and his sunglasses in her car.

Orban changed his plea- from the originally-submitted not guilty to not guilty by reason of insanity- last summer, claiming that the attack was a result of his excessive prescription of Zoloft, an anti-depressant, and Neurontin, an anti-seizure medication.","Anthony Nicholas Orban, 32, may now face life behind bars ."

Courtney Nurden, 11, needed 30 stitches to wounds on her cheek when she was bitten and clawed by the vicious animals in Newport, South Wales. The schoolgirl's mother told how the animal came up to Courtney and 'launched at her face' in the attack last week. Savage: Schoolgirl Courtney Nurden needed more than 20 stitches after being clawed and bitten by the rottweiler dog . Terrified Courtney needed stitches after being left with puncture wounds to her left cheek. Her mother Claire, 37, said: 'The dog came up to her and suddenly launched at her face. 'She fell to the ground and started screaming which brought neighbours running. 'They wrestled the dog away from Courtney and she ran home.

A boat carrying around 150 suspected asylum seekers has capsized off northwest Australia today, just a week after 90 people drowned on a similar journey. Merchant ships are currently collecting survivors from the capsizing, which happened between Indonesia and Australia's Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean. Dozens of asylum seekers are feared drowned after a second boatload of capsized in less than a week in Australian waters today. In trouble: A photo released by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority shows the boat near Christmas Island hours before it capsized . The frail wooden boat was estimated to have been carrying about 150 people and there were fears that many had drowned as rescuers were making their way to the scene of the tragedy. Just last Thursday at least 90 asylum seekers drowned when their boat, also heading for Christmas Island, capsized resulting in furious debate breaking out in Australia about the influx of asylum seekers. On hearing of today's tragedy, which mirrors the circumstances of last week's disaster, politicians blamed one another's parties for refugee policies that failed to prevent incidents like these from occurring. It is understood that the boat involved in today's tragedy was carrying Afghans who had fled their country and had used Indonesia as a staging post on their way to Australia, where they hoped to obtain political asylum. Christmas Island is the first stop in Australian waters on the dangerous sea journey from Indonesia. As rescue boats headed towards the scene, Labour MP Graham Perrett joined in the growing controversy today when he tweeted: '150 people in the water RIGHT NOW. That's one for every single elected free-thinking Member of the House of Representatives.' Capsized: The distressed vessel went over around 120 miles north of Christmas Island, an Australian territory in the Indian Ocean . Mr Mal Larsen, from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said rescue ships were beginning to arrive at the scene and some people were being pulled from the water. 'They are doing their best to pull people out,' he said. 'It's too early to say how many have been saved.' Unlike last week's tragedy, when many of the estimated 200 people on board were able to cling to the upturned hull of their capsized boat, the vessel involved in today's incident had completely sunk, said officials of Australia's Customs and Border Protection. The capsize has occurred some 105 miles north of Christmas Island about 100 miles south of Indonesia. 'Initial reports are that up to 150 people may be on board,' said the Border Patrol Command. 'Two merchant vessels are currently on the scene. 'Border Protection Command has also deployed its vessels and aircraft to assist with the operation.' The waters between Indonesia and Christmas Island are a popular route for asylum seekers, who transit through Indonesia with the help of people smugglers in often overcrowded boats. So far this year, more than 50 boats carrying more than 4,000 asylum seekers have been detected by Australian authorities. The trip is often dangerous. In December 2011, as many as 200 died when an overcrowded boat sank off the coast of East Java. In 2010, 50 asylum seekers died when their boat was thrown onto rocks at Christmas Island. In 2001, a crowded boat known as the SIEV X sank on its way to Australia with the loss of 350 lives.","Frail wooden boat carrying 150 capsizes in Indian Ocean .

Just breathe: A new breathalyser test, developed by scientists at Georgia Tech, could give the early warning signs of breast and lung cancer . A simple invention could save thousands of lives  and drastically reduce the amount of time and expense in screening patients for cancer. The cancer-detecting breathalyzer system was unveiled on June 2 at the annual American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago and is able to detect the early signs of breast and lung cancer. It is still awaiting clinical trials but may provide an alternative method to current screening processes using large scanners which are both expensive and invasive. The cancer breathalyzer was developed by scientists at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The test works by a patient blowing into a tube and the breath being captured in a specialized storage container. It can be stored for up to six weeks in proper refrigeration. The breath is then sent to a lab where a chemical sensor is applied to look for . the compounds given off by a body that has cancerous cells. The device offers an alternative to the physical discomfort of CAT scans and mammograms. It would also see the cost of testing for breast cancer drop from around $800 . to $100, according to digg.com. The breathalyser test holds even more importance for those in third world countries and remote areas with the relative ease and lower expense of the invention. Progress: Researcher Charlene Bayer (far left) discusses the innovative new cancer detection technique with colleagues . It would make it easier to test for cancer in patients who live in hard to reach regions in the jungle or mountain as the breathalyser is transportable. According to Charlene Bayer, a lead researcher on the project, the breathalyzer would not eliminate the need for further tests but it could be a simpler way to determine whether a patient needs them. She also told InnovationNewsDaily.com: 'Most of the directions people are moving in are toward the more complex, the more expensive. I wanted something that’s rugged, cheap and easy enough to be done at a routine physical.' The National Cancer Institute in the U.S. has estimated that 226,870 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 39,510 women will die of the disease in 2012. Some 116,470 men and 109,690 women will be diagnosed with lung and bronchus cancer this year while 160,340 people will die of the illness. Invasive: Mammograms are costly and uncomfortable for the patient compared to the new test - which is still to undergo clinical trials .","Screening technique for breast and lung cancer developed by Georgia Tech .

A nine-year-old boy fell to his death from his ninth-floor bedroom window in what police suspect was a suicide. Jarod Barnett's body was found on Wednesday afternoon by neighbours, lying on a grass verge outside his apartment block in Detroit, Michigan. According to police he had threatened suicide in the past and sources said he had recently been in trouble for shoplifting. Jarod Barnett, 9, died after falling from the ninth floor of the Young Manor building in Detroit . Michele McCray, a neighbour in the low-income Young Manor complex on Detroit's south side, raised the alarm at 5.30pm. She told the Detroit Free Press: 'I heard a thump and then someone moaning 'I really didn't feel I should go . over there.' Instead she ran inside and called 911. Police were the first to arrive on the scene, and declared Jarod dead. Shockingly no ambulance was available to attend the scene, and his body had to be taken to the nearby Henry Ford Hospital in the back of a squad car. Michigan State Representative Rashida Tlaib is outraged no ambulance could be spared, blaming city budget cuts that have left emergency services short on resources. Neighbours heard a 'thud' and called 911, but resource-starved emergency services couldn't find an ambulance to send to the scene . She told the newspaper: 'It's just unbelievable. Can you imagine the family of that child - not seeing any ambulance come.' Neighbours have meanwhile paid tribute to Jarod, who they describe as a 'good kid'. Bystander Sheila Bowman, 35, said: 'It's real sad. There's too many young people doing this.' Faith Tucker, 35, who lives on the second floor of the same building, added: 'He was a good kid - he was a skateboarder.' Police are trying to establish what caused Jarod to take his own life. Sources told Fox 2 Detroit he had recently been in trouble for shoplifting. Local pastor Barack Holmes Jr - a relative of the Barnett Family - told the station: 'It sounds accurate. His big brother had chastised him a little bit as a big brother should. And his big sister was going to deal with him when he got home. Unfortunately, it had to end up like this.' If it's ruled to be a suicide, it will be the second such tragedy to hit the poverty-stricken city in just two months. In May a seven year boy was found hanging by a belt from his bunk bed, following weeks of complaining about being bullied at school.. At the time, psychologists at the University of Michigan said that threats of suicide from young children needed to be taken seriously. They informed parents to watch out for signs of suicidal behaviour, which can take on different forms in youngsters - who can appear angry and irritable when they're depressed.","Jarod Barnett had threatened to commit suicide in the past .

"Jin Xing is now married to a German man and the mother of three . By . Laura Cox . PUBLISHED: . 12:49 EST, 3 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:40 EST, 6 April 2012 . The last time Jin Xing was in New York she was a man. The Chinese film star, talk show host and celebrated dancer is experiencing the city as a woman for the first time. She recently began her first U.S. tour with her company, Jin Xing Dance Theatre, which premiered in New York, where she studied modern dance 20 years ago. Scroll down for video . Impressive: Jin Xing is a celebrated dancer in China . A lot has changed for the 44-year-old in that time, including her gender after she became the first person to have a sex change in China and go public about it. The mother-of-three went under the knife in 1995 in a sex change operation that almost ended her career as a dancer and has since become a cultural icon in China, used by the government as an unofficial ambassador of the arts. ‘They want to tell the world, “We do have an independent, free artist like Jin Xing”,’ she told MSN. As a 9-year-old boy, Xing battled with her parents to allow her to attend a military school for dance, finally persuading them after a successful two-day hunger strike. Alongside learning how to fire a machine gun and blow up a bridge with a bomb, Xing learned to dance under strict, disciplined instruction. The military instructors would tie each student’s leg to a vertical column so that they were forced into the splits. ‘We are screaming and shouting, but . the teachers, our teachers, are sitting there reading a morning . newspaper and looking, “five more minutes”,’ she said. ‘I think, . according to America or western law, this is completely child abuse, no . doubt. But in China culture, you have to sacrifice.’ Aged 18 she was selected to come to . America to study modern dance in New York City and found herself . training with top tier dance companies and emerging choreographers like . Mark Dendy. ‘Jin Xing was amazing, is amazing, . still amazing,’ Dendy said. ‘There’s always a look in the eye when . someone’s really, really great and we just say, “They’ve got it”.’ ‘Pirouettes, grand jetes… he had, she . had amazing air,’ Dendy said.  ‘It’s the ability to go up in the air . and have a cup of coffee and come down.’ Star: As well as a talented dancer, Xing is also a chat show host and film star . Talent: She choreographs for her company, Jin Xing Dance Theatre . Dramatic: Xing said she doesn't mind if people go to see her perform because of her story rather than her dancing . While in the city Xing tried out dating men, unsure if she was gay or transgender, eventually making the decision to return to China for sex change surgery aged 28. Her mother struggled when she broke the news - even scarier still was telling her father, a former military officer and member of China’s secret police. But he took it surprisingly well. ‘Strangely enough, 20 years ago, I look at [you], I was wondering, I have a little boy, but you behave everything like a little girl. So after 28 years, you find yourself, congratulations.’ The surgery went well, but there were complications. The operation damaged Xing’s left leg and she feared she might never dance again. Three months after the surgery, however, she was back on stage in Beijing. Her life changed again in 2000 when . she became a mother, adopting her son, Leo, then her daughter, Vivian, . and lastly her little boy Julian. Then she fell in love with a German man she sat next to on a flight from Paris to Shanghai and the pair were married a year later. ‘I’m in the lounge and I’m waiting for boarding and a Chinese lady appears at the lounge. I wouldn’t say low key. ‘She was wearing a long leather coat, . miniskirt, leather boots, Louis Vuitton bag on one side and a Chihuahua . in her hand,’ said Heinz Gerd Oidtmann, her husband, who added that he . doesn’t like to think of her former life as a man. ‘Somehow, I’m not really connected to . that part of her life.  I want to keep pure the female image that I . have of my wife and it is very purely a female impression that I have of . her.' Surgery: Xing went under the knife 17 years ago. She said she was terrified of telling her military father but he took it well . Complications: Xing's leg was injured during the surgery and she feared she might never dance again, but three months later she was back on stage . Confused: As a boy Xing initially couldn't work out whether she was gay or transgender and dated men in New York while studying dance . It’s been 17 years since her sex change, and Xing’s star status continues to rise. As well as dancing and choreographing, she’s acting in films and appearing on China’s versions of Dancing with the Stars and American Idol. The Chinese government monitors her closely, watching what she posts on China’s version of Twitter and keeps a close eye on her dancing. ‘In China, before all the performing arts are only used for propaganda use, but if the art form [is to] become independent, that takes a little time,’ Xing said. And while she acknowledges that some people come to see her perform because of her personal transformation, it doesn’t seem to bother her. ‘If my personal story can bring [the] public into the theatre, I’m already successful,’ she said.  ‘Because after one and a half hour, they’re talking about my dancing, they’re not talking about my sex change.’ Visit msnbc.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy .",Jin Xing is now married to a German man and the mother of three .

The sentencing of a man convicted of murdering a woman whose body has never been found will be filmed for television in a legal first. Permission has been granted to record the judge’s sentencing of David Gilroy at the High Court in Edinburgh next week for the murder of Suzanne Pilley. The camera will focus on judge Lord Bracadale and nobody else will feature in the footage except the macer and the clerk, a spokesman for the Judiciary of Scotland said. Gilroy, 49, will not be filmed. 'Rare insight': In a British legal first, TV cameras will film the sentencing of David Gilroy (left), who was convicted last month of murdering Suzanne Pilley (right) Lord Hamilton, the Lord President and Lord Justice General, approved the application from broadcaster STV. Gilroy, from Edinburgh, was found guilty on March 15 of murdering 38-year-old Miss Pilley. He was also found guilty of attempting to defeat the ends of justice by concealing the office worker’s body and driving it to various locations in Scotland in the boot of his car. Filming will start when Gilroy’s defence lawyer finishes the plea in mitigation at the sentencing hearing on April 18. Following Gilroy’s conviction last month, Miss Pilley’s family pleaded with her killer to tell them where her body is buried. Unable to grieve properly: Miss Pilley's parents, Robert and Sylvia (above), have pleaded with Gilroy to reveal where her body is buried . Miss Pilley’s elderly parents said they had been unable to grieve properly for their daughter since she vanished nearly two years ago during a routine journey to work. The court heard Gilroy killed Miss Pilley in a jealous rage after she told him their affair was over. Prosecutors painted a ‘compelling and convincing’ circumstantial case of a deceitful, controlling individual who lured Miss Pilley to her death in the basement of their office in Edinburgh before driving her body to a forest in Argyll where they believe he dumped her. Her final resting place is still a mystery and the landmark verdict is one of only a handful of cases in which a murderer has been convicted in the absence of a body. STV spokesman . Miss Pilley’s parents, Sylvia and Robert, were in court to watch Gilroy be convicted of murder and the second charge of attempting to defeat the ends of justice. As the jury delivered its majority verdicts after three days, Miss Pilley’s mother wept uncontrollably in the public benches, comforted by her husband. The couple, who sat through every distressing detail of the 19-day trial, later called on father-of-two Gilroy to end their long torment and reveal where their daughter is buried. However, Gilroy’s wife and family later issued their own statement vowing to stand by the killer and insisting he was innocent. In a statement, which also thanked police and prosecutors, Mr and Mrs Pilley, both 67, said: ‘Finally, Suzanne has received the justice she deserved. ‘As a family we continue to struggle to come to terms with losing her. We have lost our daughter but her memory lives on in everyone who knew her. ‘Although the trial has ended, our ordeal goes on and we hope that one day we can lay our daughter to rest.’ Last night, an STV spokesman said: ‘This is the first time in the UK TV news cameras have been allowed to film a sentencing in a criminal court. 'The development will allow viewers a rare insight into the closing stages of what has been a very controversial murder case.’ Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: ‘By televising this, people like Gilroy will face a day of reckoning.

Chef Kevin Viner, who runs Michelin-starred Viners Bar and Restaurant in Truro, Cornwall, has been the victim of an ongoing dispute with his landlord . A wealthy businessman has been given a suspended prison sentence after refusing to let go of an on-going dispute with an internationally acclaimed chef. Landlord Eric Randle tried to evict chef Kevin Viner from the Michelin-starred Viners Bar and Restaurant based in his multimillion-pound Carvynick Country Club near Truro over a row about rent and utility bills. Randle admitted cutting off electricity to Viners in July last year, forcing the chef to cook on a barbecue during a wedding party, and was ordered to pay the chef's legal bill of £16,781 and given an injunction forcing him not to interfere with the chef's business. But Randle refused to let the matter drop and was witnessed threatening Mr Viner at his restaurant in October, telling him: 'You have no right, this is my f***ing pub. I am going to finish you. 'You don't have the money to fight me. I don't care about the injunction or the police.' Randle also threatened to sabotage a grease trap in the garden of the restaurant which would have forced grease to back up into the kitchen during a busy Saturday service. Mr Viner, who has been named Britain's best chef, took proceedings against his former friend at Truro County Court 'as a last resort' to salvage his reputation and business. The chef said he was 'hanging on by his fingernails' and in fear of Randle who 'had a temper'. He said: 'I was crying all the time. I was in a state. I had put my whole future into the restaurant. I am a reputable chef and my life has been destroyed.' Randle was found to have breached the injunction and given a 28-day jail sentence suspended for two years. Randle, who said he would appeal, was ordered to make an interim payment of £7,500 for legal costs. Judge Barry Cotter, QC, said the suspended jail threat was needed to ensure Randle complies with the injunction but should not be seen as the 'sword of Damocles' hanging over him. Judge Cotter called it a 'sad and protracted case' that was aggravated by Randle's false statements, contempt of court and failure to purge his contempt during the two day hearing.

Residents are perplexed by bizarre and unorthodox jobs that have suddenly cropped up on the local council – courtesy of the city’s first elected mayor. Among the roles for Ian Stewart’s 13 (yes, 13) assistant mayors is one of workplace reform and ‘humanegement’. Top team: Mayor Ian Stewart (bottom row centre), with his 13 assistants - including one for 'humanegement' Criticism: Ian Stewart has appointed a deputy and 13 assistant mayors - including two who are also strategic assistants . The word was invented by Mr Stewart – the former Labour MP for Eccles – as a more ethical term for human resources. During research into the labour market, he decided existing references made workers sound like commodities. He said: ‘Humanegement is a word I have created to describe human engagement with staff. It is an alternative to the term human resources, which I feel makes employees sound like commodities. ‘I therefore prefer to use this term as effective working with staff is about engagement, working with them to get the best possible outcomes. ‘I said we should have a more civilised approach and what we needed to develop was a humane management system. That is why it’s spelt with an “e” – it is a humane system.’ The mayor’s explanation of the role left some residents fuming yesterday and accusing him of turning the city into a ‘laughing stock’. Salford city centre: Mr Stewart, former MP for Eccles, was elected Salford's first mayor on May 3 . Phil Reid, 38, a builder, said: ‘Oh spare us the management speak – when politicians talk this way voters are just turned off. We have a reputation for plain-talking in Salford but obviously the new mayor hasn’t quite grasped it. What an absolute joke.’ Janet Edwards, a teacher, said: ‘I’d like to see him knocking on voters’ doors in downtown Salford and trying to explain humanegement.’ Among the other responsibilities for the assistant mayors are international relations, technology, culture, communications and transport within the city region. Karen Garrido, the Conservative group leader who ran against Labour’s Mr Stewart for mayor, said most of the roles were not needed. Among . the more unorthodox job titles in Salford’s new leadership team is the . assistant mayor for workplace reform and ‘humanegement’. The . word - pronounced ‘hu-management’ - was invented by Ian Stewart more . than 20 years ago as a more ethical term for human resources. During research into the labour market he decided existing terms made workers sound like commodities. He said: 'I said we should have a more civilised approach and what we needed to develop was a humane management system. 'That is why it’s spelt with an ‘e’ - it is a humane system.' Humanegement is one of around half a dozen words and phrases invented by Mr Stewart, who has the rights to their use. They . include ‘co-opetition’ (a mix of co-operation and competition), and . ‘matters in Salford’, which he intends to use in the future as part of . the city’s branding. She said: ‘I wouldn’t have that many. I would deal with what’s important. What’s important about international relations? The mayor can do that. He should be dealing with those things, representing the city in China and so on.’ Under the previous system Salford’s council leader was supported by a 17-strong cabinet, drawing allowances of between £6,000 and £14,600. The new assistant mayors will get allowances of between £9,000 and £14,600, with the overall cost being approximately the same. Mr Stewart – who was elected on May 3 – said all positions would be continually reviewed to ensure they were working properly. He added: ‘What we have done is tried to make sure a sensible approach at equal or lower cost has taken place. We have done that quite deliberately, with an eye to the interests of the people of Salford and their families.’ He said priorities included boosting digital access, attracting international investment into Salford and reconnecting with the community.

Mr Stewart, who was a Labour MP for 13 years, admits his made-up terms raise a few laughs, but says that is part of the point. He added: ‘I’m quite happy for words to cause hilarity because it captures people’s attention. It makes people laugh but it also helps  capture the dilemma between different concepts.’ Councillor Paul Dennett, who has been made assistant mayor for humanegement, admitted some found the term puzzling. He said: ‘The word is not in the Oxford dictionary, so I guess there is no correct way to say it. It has created a bit of a debate.’","Roles include international relations, technology and ‘humanegement’, a word he invented to refer to human resources .

James Burley, pictured outside Newcastle Crown Court yesterday, denies racially aggravated harassment . A woman was subjected to a shocking racist poison pen campaign by her former partner after she brought her new black boyfriend into a village community, a court heard. James Burley is accused of claiming his ex-partner Sharon Auld was breaking the village 'code of conduct' when she brought her African boyfriend to Pegswood, Northumberland. Newcastle Crown Court heard yesterday that Miss Auld’s new partner Frank Olufemi was the only Nigerian living in the former mining village when Burley began his harassment campaign in 2010. In a series of vile notes to Miss . Auld, one of which arrived on the day she became engaged to her new . partner, the 74-year-old branded Africans paedophiles, said they were . all born with Aids and that Mr Olufemi should be sent back to the . 'jungle', it is claimed. Prosecutor Christopher Rose told the court the first letter was sent to Ms Auld’s mother in March 2010. Extracts . of it were read out in court, which said: 'We don’t do black. You . Auld’s must be the only lot who don’t know the code of conduct in our . village. 'We think you should get it sorted. You know as well as anyone they are born with Aids, it would be a shame if you got that as well.' The next correspondence arrived on the very day Ms Auld, whose five year relationship with Burley ended in 2006, got engaged to Mr Olufemi and contained a newspaper cutting referring to conflict in Nigeria. More letters were received in June, one of which referred to the note sent to Ms Auld’s mother. One said: 'Nothing has seemed to change. We take it she condones your stupid actions or you just do as you want to.' The same letter continued: 'Aids came from men in Nigeria having sex with small boys and bringing it into our country.' Another extract said: 'Throw him back into the jungle where he belongs. Get out of our village with this horrible black man. Sharon Auld (pictured) told jurors she was 'gobsmacked' to receive the offensive material on the day of her engagement . 'We don’t do black in this village. We should not have to repeat our feelings.' A letter sent in July of that year questioned how Mr Olufemi’s would provide for Ms Auld and said he only wanted a British Visa. In other letters Ms Auld was branded the 'village trollop' and called a 'slut' and there was an explicit sexual reference. One comment regarding Mr Olufemi said: 'He looks as though someone has been chopping sticks on his face, he has a big mouth, massive lips.' A further letter sent in December 2010 said Ms Auld had made a 'mistake' bringing a black man into the village. The court heard eight diaries were found during a search of Burley’s home  some of which contained similar extracts to what was said in the letters. Burley’s DNA was found in saliva on the seal of one of the envelopes which contained an offensive letter. One letter that arrived spoke in ‘glowing terms’ about Burley and made reference to the breakdown of the relationship between him and Ms Auld. Ms Auld told jurors she was 'gobsmacked' to receive the offensive material on the day of her engagement. Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) heard Miss Auld's new partner was the only Nigerian living in the village when Burley began his harassment campaign in 2010 . She told jurors: 'I was just gobsmacked and quite upset about it. It was just trying to tell me Nigerians were evil people basically.' Mr Rose told jurors: 'The prosecution say each and every message was sent with the aim of harassing Sharon Auld and knowing it would cause her harassment. 'The references to her new partner are obviously racist in nature.' The court heard Burley began a relationship with Ms Auld in 2001 despite being married. Mr Rose, prosecuting, said: 'It was at the time a relationship which must have caused no small amount of upset to the defendant’s family as he was married. 'When the relationship ended in the summer of 2006, at Ms Auld’s behest, it will have caused the defendant a great deal of upset and bitterness. 'It is perhaps because of that, the prosecution say, this offence occurs.' Burley told police he had not sent the letters and suggested they must have been sent by a friend of his. That man has since died but his daughter told police her father had never been friends with Burley. Burley, of Pegswood, Northumberland, denies racially aggravated harassment. The trial continues.","James Burley 'claimed relationship broke Northumberland village's code of conduct'

Big issue: A schoolgirl aged just 11 was among more than 40 children admitted to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital with anorexia over a five-year period . The bombshell comes as a report by MPs says that more than half of the British public suffers from a negative body image. The problem is so acute that girls as young as five now worry about their size and appearance. Norwich-based national eating disorders charity Beat is a member of the Campaign For Body Confidence steering group and submitted evidence to the national inquiry. The charity says poor body image and low self-esteem are key factors in the development of eating disorders. It is now working with toiletries giant Dove to provide free self-esteem workshops in schools across Britain. Penny Baily, founder of Norwich's Newmarket House Clinic, a specialist inpatient hospital for people with eating disorders, said: 'Severe anorexia is a very serious condition. 'It's wrong that people reach such a low level of health before they are admitted for inpatient treatment at a general hospital.' Half of the British public suffers from a negative body image. The problem is so acute that girls as young as five now worry about their size and appearance . She added: 'When patients are admitted to general wards for re-feeding, they are occupying beds that could be used more appropriately by other patients, for example those with renal or heart conditions. 'They put a strain on medical and nursing staff who have not been training to treat the complex symptoms of this particular illness. 'For 16 years, Newmarket House in Norwich has been accepting NHS-funded patients from Norfolk and other parts of the country.

'If patients are admitted before their weight has dropped to a critical level, staff at this specialist clinic are able to combine careful re-feeding with psychological interventions to enable the patient to sustain recovery.

Paula Stevenson, seen here with a picture of her baby girl Hayley, describe her daughter's treatment at Birmingham Children's Hospital as 'brutal' The family of a baby girl who died after doctors ignored their pleas to help her said they had been treated with ‘utter contempt’, an inquest heard yesterday. Hayley Fullerton died of a massive heart attack after she was treated at Birmingham Children’s Hospital. During her care, the one-year-old twice suffered a collapsed lung after doctors mistakenly inserted a breathing tube too far down her throat. Her family say she experienced ‘brutal’ treatment at the hands of some NHS staff and have accused the hospital of ‘abominable’ failings in her care. Yesterday they told her inquest how her cardiologist had ‘barked’ and ‘glared’ at them after they raised questions over the dying baby’s care. And the family say doctors ignored their pleas to move her into intensive care – something medics now admit could have saved her life. The inquest heard that Hayley was born with a blockage which meant blood could not get from her heart to her lungs. She was operated on at one hospital, and then sent to Birmingham for heart surgery in October 2009. The operation was a success, but complications arose when staff inserted a tube into her lung incorrectly, causing it to collapse. After being told Hayley’s right lung had collapsed, her grandmother Sylvia Stevenson, who has since died, asked paediatric cardiologist Dr Oliver Stumper what treatment she could be given. Her husband Edward Stevenson told the coroner that Dr Stumper had ‘glared’ at his wife and ‘gave her a look of utter contempt’, before telling her Hayley would have to wait until the following day. Hayley Fullerton was born with a hole in her heart, and had to undergo surgery aged 10-months-old to correct it . It was during the recovery from the surgery when complications arose, ultimately leading to her tragic death . In a statement written before her . death, Mrs Stevenson said: ‘My daughter said I looked like a parent in a . third world country begging for my child’s life.’ Forty-eight hours later Hayley died after both her lungs collapsed and she went into cardiac arrest. At the inquest yesterday, her mother Paula Stevenson said: ‘I could not believe that Hayley had just been left to deteriorate. ‘All along the family had expressed . their concerns about Hayley’s breathing and had even asked if there was a . problem with her lungs, yet nothing was done. I do not understand how . things were left to get so bad.’ Dr Stumper, who has worked at . Birmingham Children’s Hospital since 1993, told the inquest he should . have provided the treatment sooner. The doctor said Hayley had been . ‘doing pretty fine’ until she suffered an ‘acute sudden collapse’ on the . morning of November 11, when both lungs collapsed and she went into . cardiac arrest. Paula Stevenson told an inquest her one-year-old daughter was overlooked and neglected at the hospital . ‘I think we provided therapy by and . large at the right time,’ he said. ‘I express my frustration and apology . that we failed, that I failed, to request physiotherapy on the evening . of November 9. Having said that, she did improve after she received . physiotherapy on November 10.’ On Monday Miss Stevenson, 40, told how . she was so desperate for nurses to pay more attention to her daughter . that she offered one a £100 bribe to ‘look after’ her. Miss Stevenson, who now lives with . Hayley’s father Bobby Fullerton and their second daughter Casey in .

A former soldier who bravely took on penny-pinching NHS bosses in his fight to get a drug that could save his life has died of terminal cancer aged 37. Mark Bannister, from Gainsborough in Lincolnshire, spent six months of his precious time trying to obtain the drug Avastin - but by the time he got it, it was too late. Wife Karen, 33, revealed how her husband was forced to lie to doctors to get hold of the life-prolonging treatment that had been denied to him because of a cruel postcode lottery. Torn apart: Mark Bannister, pictured with wife Karen and children Sophie and Thomas, died on Monday after a nine-year battle with cancer . The father of two succumbed to the brain tumour he had been battling for nine years at around 6am on Monday morning, with his wife at his side. Grieving Mrs Bannister paid tribute to . her husband, who served in Northern Ireland and Bosnia during nine years . in the army, saying: 'The Avastin didn’t have any effect but we had to . fight for six months in order to get it. 'In all that time his tumour had been . growing. In the end, he had to claim he was living at another . address in order to get the treatment. 'Who knows what would have . happened if he had got the drug sooner - I truly believe it would have . helped him. 'He was forced to lie. We were told his . chemotherapy wasn’t working and he had to either let the tumour grow or . have the Avastin - we didn’t have a choice. The only way we could get the drug was . for Mark to register at a doctor in Sheffield and say he was living at a . friend’s address. 'Within 24 hours his application had been approved and within a week he was having his first treatment. 'How can it be so easy for some people . to get it and other people are told they can’t have it at all? Brave: Mr Bannister fought in the army fro nine years before he was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2003 . 'The . system is completely unfair. We felt bad about lying, but we had gone . down the moral route and spent six months fighting for nothing. 'We had to lie while Mark was still . alive, but I don’t care who knows now. I would urge anyone else who is . going through the same thing to do what we did. 'I only wish we had done it sooner.' In December it was reported how Mark’s long battle with cancer had culminated in a fight for Avastin after his consultant said it could give him vital time with his daughter Sophie, seven, and son Thomas, five. But NHS bosses refused to fund the medicine, even though it was readily available to patients just 15 miles from where Mark lived. The 37-year-old was first diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2003 but after a long and determined battle he was told in August 2011 that his cancer had spread. Avastin, which works by preventing the blood vessels reaching the tumour and costs £21,000 for a ten-month course, was his last hope. Without it, doctors said he had just 12 months left to live. But letters to the Cancer Drugs Fund as well as East Midlands Specialised Commissioning Group were knocked back. The drug is not currently ‘readily approved’ as a treatment by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (Nice), which means funding for it sits with the Cancer Drugs Fund. NHS Lincolnshire said decisions to fund treatments are based on clear clinical evidence, cost-effectiveness, the benefit to patient and consideration of national guidance. A spokesman from EMSCG said in December: 'We were sorry to hear about this patient’s individual circumstances. Unfortunately, we are unable to comment further on individual cases. 'Currently, Avastin is not readily approved by Nice guidance and therefore funding for treatment that falls outside of Nice sits with Cancer Drugs Fund. 'Decisions about whether to fund drugs from the Cancer Drugs Fund are made solely by cancer specialists.' Helpless: Mrs Bannister said her terminally ill husband was forced to lie to doctors to get the life-prolonging treatment he had been denied because of a postcode lottery . A statement from the East Midlands Cancer Drugs Fund read: 'The panel is clear that it made the correct clinical judgement. It was a judgement made on purely clinical grounds and not in any way for financial reasons. 'Of the 10 Cancer Drugs Funds in England, the vast majority do not fund the use of Avastin for the treatment of Glioblastoma. Indeed EM CDF is aware that only two routinely fund this treatment. 'The East Midlands CDF committed £10,025,749 to be spent on cancer drugs up to the end of March 2012. The EMCDF processed 766 applications and 94 per cent of all requests were supported.' NHS East Midlands does not fund Avastin for brain cancer patients, but NHS Yorkshire and the Humber does. This means it is available for patients just 15 miles away in Scunthorpe, and in Sheffield where Mark had all of his cancer treatment, but not in Gainsborough. With an uncertain future ahead of them, the Bannisters renewed their vows last November on their tenth wedding anniversary. Mrs Bannister said: 'The nearest surgery where Mark would have been allowed the treatment was just five miles away. Mark could have walked it.' Grief: By the time Mr Bannister got the drug in February, his cancer was too advanced for it to have any effect . Mr Bannister’s application was approved in February but his cancer, which he had fought since the age of 29, was already too advanced for the drug to have any affect and was affecting his balance and coordination. His wife said: 'I know he’s been poorly and we all knew it would happen at some point, but it is still such a shock. 'He fell over on Thursday and he fell against the bedroom door so I had to call an ambulance to come and get him out but he only went into hospital because the paramedics were worried about his neck. 'He was supposed to be coming out but they couldn’t discharge him because of the bank holiday. 'As far as we were concerned, he was coming home. He had been tired over the last few weeks but he had still been his normal self. 'When he was in hospital he had been laughing and joking with the nurses and giving them stick like he always has done, but then he started complaining of head pains and he was put on stronger painkillers. 'After that he was a lot drowsier and when I took the kids into see him on Sunday night he was sleeping peacefully. Then I got the call to say he had taken a turn for the worse in the early hours of Monday morning. 'As he died, I was holding him and cuddling him and telling him I loved him. Only a few more days and it would have been exactly nine years since his diagnosis.' In the last year, the family have tried to pack as many memories into the time Mark had left, taking their children on holidays to Butlins and on days out. Before his death, Mrs Bannister prepared memory boxes for Sophie and Thomas, leaving them special photographs and medals from his time in the army. His wife added: 'I don’t think his death has sunk in yet. I don’t think I totally believe it. I still have to break it to the children and I don’t know what I will say to them. Because they are still so young they won’t understand it for a while until they realise he’s not coming home. 'I won’t know what words I will use to tell them until I actually have to say them. 'Mark has written them both letters saying how much he loves them and how he is sorry he won’t get to see them grow up. He was such a loving husband and father, there was nothing he wouldn’t have done for his family. 'People often complain about the smallest things, but Mark never once complained, he was so brave. 'Even after he got the Avastin he continued to campaign against the postcode lottery on behalf of others and I want to continue to do the same. It’s what he would have wanted.'","Father of two spent six months battling to get drug Avastin .

The Obama administration ordered federal, state and local prisons to increase efforts to stop prison rape by issuing mandatory screening, enforcement and prevention regulations in hopes of reducing sexual victimization behind bars. The Justice Department announced the regulations Thursday on the heels of a new study showing that almost one in every 10 former state or local prisoners reported being sexually victimized at least once in prison. The new regulations are immediately binding on federal prisons. Alarming: A new report by the Justice Department claims that inmates in state prisons were as likely to have sex with staff members as they were other inmates and that one out of every ten U.S. inmates has been raped . Betterment: The Obama Administration ordered federal, state and local prisons to increase efforts to stop prison rape by issuing mandatory screening, enforcement and prevention regulations . State prisons face losing federal money if they don't comply, and local jails will not be able to get re-accredited without falling in line. The White House also ordered that all federal detainment facilities outside of the prison system come up with ways to fight prison rape within a year. The findings, reported by the Bureau of Justice Statistics in the first-ever National Former Prisoners Survey, may indicate a greater problem with sexual victimization than previously thought. Surveyors found that 9.6 per cent of former inmates said they were sexually victimized in jails, prisons and halfway houses. A somewhat similar survey of still-imprisoned convicts done by the same agency in 2008-2009 found that only 4.4 per cent of state and federal inmates said they were sexually victimized. The difference may be because the former inmates in the current survey were asked about a longer time period than in the previous survey, said Allen J. Beck, one of the authors of the survey. Startling results: Surveyors found that 9.6 per cent of former inmates said they were sexually victimized in jails, prisons and halfway houses . Reform: The new regulations are immediately binding on federal prisons, while state prisons face losing federal money if they don't comply . But it also could be that former inmates may be more willing to talk about the sexual victimization than the inmates currently housed inside those facilities, who have concerns about retaliation or retribution for speaking up. Critics have said inmates may be willing to lie on these surveys in an attempt to embarrass a facility or refuse to report an incident for fear of retaliation. ‘By looking at inmates who are out of that environment, who no longer have that immediate fear of retaliation, of retribution, who moreover don't have an immediate motivation to falsely accuse since they're out of the facility entirely, we get a sense that through interviewing these former inmates that our past work is confirmed, that some of the concerns about false negatives and false positives may have been overstated,’ Beck told the Associated Press. The study defines sexual victimization as all types of unwanted sexual activity with other inmates, abusive sexual activity with other inmates and both willing and unwilling sexual activity with staff.","Report by Justice Department says that one out of ten inmates is sexually victimized at least once while in prison .

An Australian reality TV star and socialite was jailed for at least 11 years today after stabbing his girlfriend repeatedly in a 'Romeo and Juliet scenario' where he wanted them to die together. Joel Betts, 32, held his girlfriend Samantha Holland hostage in their apartment after she broke up with him, before knifing her nearly 30 times so they 'could die together and be together for eternity'. Miss Holland, 25, only survived the attempted murder in April 2010 by convincing Betts to hand her the knife mid-attack. Savage: Joel Betts subjected girlfriend Samantha Holland to a 'sustained' attempted murder knife attack after she broke up with him . After the knife had plunged into her back and neck more than two dozen times, Miss Holland 'acquitted herself with great courage and intelligence' by convincing Betts, whom she had recently broken up with, to give her the knife so they could 'die together' in a Romeo and Juliet-type scenario. Sydney District County Court heard that, bleeding and wearing only her underwear, Miss Holland miraculously escaped the savage knife attack by swinging off the balcony of the third-floor apartment on to the balcony of the apartment below. The judge said that Betts 'intended that she was not going to leave the apartment alive. She was going to die at his hands.' The court had heard that Miss Holland told Betts as he was stabbing her: 'If we're going to die together, then I should have a turn with the knife.' Sentence: Samantha Holland leaves court today after seeing her former boyfriend Joel Betts, pictured right in 2007, jailed for 11 years for the 'vile' knife attack . Betts was well known in Australian showbusiness circles following his appearance as a contender on Australian Survivor and as a presenter on cable TV. He was also seen in Sydney's night-time venues and was regarded as a 'man about town'. As a packed gallery listened in Sydney's Downing Centre District Court, Judge Toner said: 'This was a sustained and deliberate attempt to kill Miss Holland.' 'It was, as the victim (who survived) so eloquently put it, 'a scarifying experience'.' Judge Robert Toner branded Betts's crime as 'vile' and said Ms Holland will live with the 'psychological trauma' of what happened to her for the rest of her life. He told the court: '(The attack) must have felt like an eternity to her, beyond anything she could have ever imagined.' The court heard that at the time of the attack, in April, 2010, Miss Holland, who had broken up with Betts, had returned to the apartment to collect her belongings when he confronted her, asking her to stay. Jailed: a judge at Sydney's Downing Centre District Court told Betts his 'vile' attack was a 'sustained and deliberate attempt to kill Miss Holland' When she refused, he stabbed her up to eight times before turning the knife on itself, inflicting serious wounds to his stomach. Then he stabbed Miss Betts a further 20 times. 'I want us to die together so we can be together for eternity,' he told her during the attack. A note found in the apartment later roughly quoted Bon Jovi lyrics - 'you know that I love you but I hate you because I know I can never replace you.'","Former 'Survivor' star knifed girlfriend nearly 30 times after she dumped him .

A British tycoon last night condemned his own firm for making an Argentine advertisement surreptitiously shot in the Falklands to claim ownership of the islands. Sir Martin Sorrell’s surprise intervention came after Foreign Secretary William Hague attacked the film as a ‘stunt’. Sir Martin said he was ‘appalled and embarrassed’ by the ‘totally unacceptable’ advert, and that apologies had been issued. 'An absolute insult': Argentine Olympic hopeful Fernando Zylberberg is seen running 'step-ups' over the steps of the British Great War Memorial in the Falkland Islands . The film, set to stirring martial music, shows Argentine Olympic hockey team player Fernando Zylberberg, 34, training in the British territory – including running on the spot on a war memorial – before ending with the slogan: ‘To compete on English soil, we are training on Argentine soil.’ Argentine president Cristina Kirchner, who reiterated claims to the ‘Malvinas’ on the recent 30th anniversary of her nation’s doomed invasion, put out the 90-second advertisement on television in her country under her own name. Mr Zylberberg ratcheted the row up even further yesterday by revealing how filming took place under false pretences – and saying that as he performed he felt like he was ‘running towards a battlefield’. The advertisement was produced by the Buenos Aires wing of the advertising giant Young and Rubicam, a subsidiary of Sir Martin’s firm WPP. Return to the Falklands: Simon Weston, who was injured in the war 30 years ago, and Sir Martin Sorrell (right) Last night he said: ‘The ad is totally unacceptable. The agency has formally apologised for any offence or pain caused. We are appalled and embarrassed by it.’ Mr Hague said yesterday: ‘Argentina has had some diplomatic setbacks in the last few weeks. ‘They failed at a summit of the Americas to get other countries – South and North America – to issue a declaration on the Falkland Islands. I think what is happening is they are looking for one or two stunts to try to make up for that or save a bit of pride somehow. ‘But I don’t think trying to misuse the Olympics in some way for political purposes will go down very well with other countries.’ Opening scene: After a caption reading 'Islas Malvinas', the Argentinian name for the Falkand Islands, hockey player Zylberberg is seen stepping out early in the morning for a run . Obvious landmarks: As the advert progresses, Zylberberg can be seen limbering up outside the Globe Tavern, a popular pub in Port Stanley . Passing ALL the sights: As rousing music reaches its eventual peak, Zylberberg jogs past the office of the Penguin News, which today ran quotes from Falkland Islander Ian Hansen criticising the advert . The Foreign Office also criticised the advert as an attempt to exploit the Games, while ignoring the Falklanders’ wish to remain British. Mr Zylberberg proudly told yesterday how he and three fellow athletes entered the Falkland marathon in March as a ruse to get on to the island. ‘The filming took place in secret,’ he added. ‘I ran thinking of my own personal training for the Olympics but also with the idea in my head that I was running towards a battlefield.’ Iconic British phone box: There's little doubt over why the advert's makers included this shot in the mix . Evocative and provocative: A close-up shot shows a hand, supposedly Zylberberg's, meaningfully rolling sand through its fingers . Pointed message: With the rugged Falkland Islands countryside in the background, the caption reads: 'To compete on English soil' Dramatic pause: After the first caption fades out, the most incendiary comment follows: 'We are training on Argentine soil' Final say: In an emotion-charged final shot, the screen fades to white with the message: 'Tribute to the fallen and ex-combatants' Young and Rubicam sent American cameramen to arouse less suspicion before reportedly giving Mrs Kirchner a copy of the film, then selling her government the right to use it. Last night a spokesman for the firm in New York said: ‘We strongly condemn this work and have asked the Argentine government to pull the spot.’ The Daily Mail has also learnt that Young and Rubicam’s British wing, Rainey Kelly Campbell Roalfe, is currently reaping a fat payment from Britain after producing the BBC’s current advertisement for its Olympics coverage.","War veteran Simon Weston brands advert 'an absolute insult'

A Georgia bar owner has sparked outrage by displaying a sign outside his establishment calling Barack Obama a 'n***er'. Patrick Lanzo, of Paulding County, insists that the sign beside the Georgia Peach Oyster Bar is not racist and is simply a political protest over the President's policies. Yet the owner advertises his drinking hole as a 'Klan Bar' - a clear reference to far-right group the Ku Klux Klan - and has a history of catering to some of the most notorious racist organisations in the U.S. Offensive: The large sign calling the U.S. President a 'n***er' is displayed prominently outside Patrick Lanzo's Georgia Peach Oyster Bar . The message on Lanzo's sign reads, 'I do not support the n***** in the White House.' But Lanzo said he 'did not feel bad about anything whatsoever', according to Atlanta's Fox 5. He added: 'I say just because you're offended . by it doesn't mean you don't have the right to say something just the . opposite. Controversial: The Georgia bar owner says he is not racist, despite calling his establishment a 'Klan Bar' 'Therefore, they can go out and . put their own sign in their own yard and I will not be offended. It is not the first time he has caused uproar by placing offensive slogans outside his bar. In 2009, he installed a sign . that read, 'Obama's plan for health-care: n***** rig it.' Again, he maintained it was simply a protest against the government's policies on healthcare, rather than racist abuse. Asked why he had chosen to use the word, Lanzo replied, 'Well, I've used it . most of my life. There are different ways to put your opinion up, but . that's just the words I choose.' Fox 5 reported that Paulding County . officials know about the sign, but can do little to prevent it. In the U.S., hate speech is legal (except for obscenity, defamation, incitement to riot, and fighting words). Laws prohibiting hate speech are unconstitutional in the U.S.; the federal government and state governments are broadly forbidden by the First Amendment of the Constitution from restricting speech. Unchecked: Lanzo has angered the community previously by displaying similar signs criticising the president using racist language . Shocking: Lanzo also has displays of prominent black leaders alongside racist imagery inside his Paulding County bar . Unsuccessful . protests have been mounted by the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], a group of which Lanzo bizarrely once . told CBS Atlanta he was a member.

The European Parliament has approved a new series of caps on the cost of making calls or browsing the internet when travelling within the EU. The move is designed to put an end to the so-called ‘bill shock’ many experience when they  arrive home from a holiday or business trip. Good news! From July it will be cheaper to make calls and use the internet abroad . The existing cap on mobile calls will come down from 35 cents (28p) a minute to 29 cents (23p) from July 1. This will drop to 19 cents (15p) by the summer of 2014. There is currently no limit on the cost of mobile internet use, which can lead to enormous bills – but from next month there will be a cap of 70 cents (56p) per megabyte, falling to 20 cents (16p) in 2014. Charges for text messages and receiving calls will also be cut. Pleased: Labour MEP Mary Honeyball said the new charges will ensure hardworking people aren't left out of pocket . The caps will not apply for anyone heading outside the EU, but these customers will receive a warning message if they are approaching a data download charge of €50 (£40). German MEP Angelika Niebler said: ‘Using mobile devices abroad remains expensive. ‘During the summer holidays, our citizens will be able to take advantage of more favourable tariffs. Parliament has succeeded in its call for cheaper roaming prices for consumers, and in particular for data roaming.’ Labour MEP for the South-East Peter Skinner added: ‘Brits travelling abroad this summer will really feel the difference in their pocket. It will be cheaper to make a call, send a text or check Facebook or the football scores online. When you’re travelling, you often want to download data, to find out about places to visit, for example. So there will be a dramatic reduction in prices, particularly for internet use.’ Mary Honeyball, Labour MEP for London, said: ‘For far too long, exorbitant and unnecessary fees have cost EU citizens. ‘These charges are unjustifiable and we finally have been able to intervene and set up sensible fees which don’t put ordinary hard-working people out of pocket.’ Monique Goyens of the European consumer group BEUC said: ‘This welcome news is the latest step down from sky-high roaming costs. What is significant here is the first ever cap on data roaming, meaning it will now cost a maximum 70 euro cents per megabyte, falling to 20 cents in 2014.’ However, she added that, ‘given the proliferation of smartphones and, more notably, the actual cost of data provision for operators, this is still too high . . . bear in mind that’s €700 (£561) per gigabyte’. She continued: ‘The issue of transparency remains a concern. ‘A recent EU-wide survey found 74 per cent of consumers are hesitant to use their phone abroad to call, check email or download photos for fear of cost. This latest battle for fairer pricing can only help reduce that number.’ Although the cuts will be welcomed by consumers, mobile networks have responded to previous caps by increasing other charges to recoup any lost income. From July, a 50p cap will stop you running up a huge bill if you forget to switch your phone's data roaming function off.

After later running away from his south-west London home, he became an apprentice at the Roberts Brothers’ Circus, where he trained as a juggler. One year later, in 1962, he learned more of the business side of the operation with Joe Gandey's Circus. There, he also honed his skills in tenting, clowning and animal grooming.

Billed as Gerry Melville the Teenage Juggler, he starred in a number of shows over the next eight years - and in 1968, he married Betty Fossett, the youngest daughter of circus showman Jim Fossett .

With years of experience, an eye for stunts, canny marketing and a gift for showmanship, his Big Top was a huge success. By 1976, he was running two shows, which gave rise to several permutations: Gerry Cottle’s Circus, . Cottle and Austen’s Circus on Ice, Cottle and Austen’s 'London Festival' Circus and Gerry Cottle’s New Circus. At its peak, his arenas seated 1,500 and required 150 truck to transport the show. However, the 1980s saw a growing backlash by the public against the use of animals in circus acts. Although he won a case against Edinburgh Council regarding the use of wild animals in his shows, he sold his last elephant by 1993 and toured with a non-animal circus. In the mid-1990s, he also managed the Moscow State Circus and Chinese State Circus. Cottle’s . most radical departure came in 1995 when he launched the Circus of . Horrors at Glastonbury, inspired by . French circus Archaos.

Gerry Cottle told Money Mail that he got £6 a week for working as a clown when he started out . In 2006, Gerry Cottle was interviewed by Money Mail... HOW MUCH WAS IN YOUR FIRST WAGE PACKET? I got £6 a week as a clown when I started in 1961. The next year, when I had picked up some juggling skills, I was on £9 a week. I had the same contract with a few new figures scribbled over the top of the old ones. This was in the days of 'no play, no pay'. So if a show was cancelled because bad weather had ruined the ground - which was quite common - it meant starving or making sure you had saved a bit from the week before. WHAT WAS YOUR BEST FINANCIAL MOVE? Twice I've bought farms that have turned into big money later on. My best move was buying a farm in Surrey as the winter HQ for the circus for £40,000. We lived there for 30 years and sold it for £3m. The M25 had not been built when we arrived there in 1975. AND YOUR WORST? Taking the circus to Iran during the revolution in 1979. We'd been booked by the general of the Iranian army and were not paid the promised deposit. We'd already booked the acts, including ice-skating chimps from Italy, and loaded our equipment on the boats when I realised. There was a 6pm curfew which meant no one was allowed to leave their homes. We never got paid, ran out of money and had to do a midnight flit from our hotel. The debts bankrupted me. HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY FOR YOUR FIRST HOME? I bought a converted ambulance when I was 17. It cost £17.50 but I had terrible trouble getting it insured because I was so young and in showbusiness. I shared it with an Indian chair balancer called Billy Gunga. The only peace I got was when he fell in love with a fish and chip shop owner in Brighton and would go and visit her. My first non-mobile home was the farm I mentioned earlier. HOW MANY CREDIT CARDS ARE IN YOUR WALLET? Two. One personal and one for business use for my spooky caves attraction, Wookey Hole in Somerset. DO YOU PREFER TO PAY BY CASH OR CARD? Cash, definitely. I used to buy everything with cash and still like to now if I can. I love an auction. HOW MUCH CASH DO YOU HAVE IN YOUR WALLET? A couple of hundred pounds most of the time. HOW ARE YOU SAVING FOR YOUR RETIREMENT? I never really want to retire. I've given up on pensions as I believe they are grey-suited robbers. I've lost a lot of money over the years. If I had relied on my pension I would be in financial difficulty now. Continuing to work and invest in my business paid off for me. My main investment is Wookey Hole. I have a five-year plan which includes building a hotel in a couple of years. Gerry Cottle's Circus, pictured yesterday, in Shepton Mallet, Somerset . WHAT WAS YOUR MOST INDULGENT PURCHASE? The world's biggest caravan. It cost £20,000 in 1976, which is equivalent to about £200,000 now. It was 55ft long and had seven rooms - I wanted everyone in the family to have their own room. It was over-indulgent not only because of the price, which was crazy for a caravan in those days, but also because it was a nightmare to travel around in. It couldn't even fit through most park gates. I've caused a few traffic jams in my time. I also bought the world's longest car - a 75ft Cadillac with full-size Jacuzzi. It was too long to drive and in the end I just put it on a trailer to showcase it. WHAT WAS THE BIGGEST TIP YOU'VE EVER GIVEN? I gave $1,000 once in America when I was buying a caravan - but it was a mistake. I'd just arrived from Hong Kong and was still thinking in Hong Kong dollars. I thought the tip was about £100 but it was actually more than £400. Another time I gave four Shetland ponies to an Irish circus family who were buying horses from us. It was a goodwill gesture which made a real bond between our families. I still get invited to stay with them whenever I am in Ireland. AND THE BEST TIP YOU'VE EVER BEEN GIVEN? An old circus boss taught me very young that when negotiating a deal you should let the other side offer first as very often it's less than you imagine. Often a farmer renting a field will suggest a lower amount than you thought he'd want. Ken Dodd also told me to 'follow the big boys'. He meant watch what the big entertainment companies such as Disney did, even down to the colour of their costumes. They've spent millions on research and marketing so they must know what they are doing.","World-famous circus king established his Big Top in 1974 .

A land and sea search will resume at first light tomorrow for an English yachtsman and his Australian companion after the wreckage of their yacht was found on an island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. The two men had earlier sent messages to family members on a satellite phone telling them they were in trouble as their yacht had run aground and was breaking up in fierce seas. Rescuers are hoping that the men, who are both in their 60s, had managed to scramble ashore on a deserted island, which is part of the Tonga group in the Pacific. Crisis: A search was on to find an English sailor and his Australian companion after their yacht the Navillus, seen here before the trip, broke up in the Pacific Ocean . Hope: The Navillus ran aground in fierce seas on a remote island and the men were able to send an SOS to family members . The names of the yachtsman have yet to be released by authorities in Tonga, New Zealand and Australia, who are co-ordinating search and rescue efforts. But rescuers have confirmed that the men managed to contact relatives on their satellite phone as their 50ft yacht Navillus broke up around them. According to yachting records, the vessel has four cabins and was built in 2008. It was previously offered for hire form a Swedish charter company. The two men were reported last night to have boarded the Navillus in the Caribbean and were sailing it across the Pacific Ocean to Bundaberg in Queensland, Australia, when it ran into trouble. Time of the essence: A Royal New Zealand Air Force Orion aircraft has been dispatched to help with the search for two sailors whose yacht ran aground on a remote island in the Pacific Ocean (file picture) They phoned at least one relative, living in Victoria, Australia, to say that they had run aground and needed help.

A Royal New Zealand Air Force Orion aircraft was due to reach Tonga at midnight and would help in the search at first light tomorrow. Lost at sea: The pair were reported to have boarded the Navillus in the Caribbean and were sailing it across the Pacific Ocean to Bundaberg in Queensland, Australia, when it ran into trouble . Search co-ordinator Geoff Lunt said from New Zealand that the crew of two local fishing boats had reported finding wreckage floating near the smashed hull. 'They have located the hull of the vessel and seen a lot of debris,'said Mr Lunt. 'The yacht's dinghy has been found and an un-deployed liferaft, as well as a number of life jackets.' Local officials said there were several potential landing points on the island close to where the hull was found and it was possible the Englishman and his companion had managed to scramble ashore and taken shelter. A crew from one of the rescue boats had gone ashore, but darkness made searching for the men impossible and it was decided to continue the rescue operation at first light. Asked what the survival time would be if the men were still in the water - and if they were wearing lifejackets - Mr Lunt said it would be at least 36 hours.","Men, both in their 60s, sent SOS to family by phone .

A ‘despicable’ mugger who injured a frail grandmother while robbing her of her purse blamed the elderly victim for her injuries - because she refused to let go. Vile heroin addict Rebecca Oxley, 36, pulled 75-year-old Irene Bracewell to the floor as she tried to run away with her wallet after asking the pensioner for her spare change. The victim tried to cling onto her purse but fell flat on her face and was left stricken on the floor as Ms Oxley ran off with the item containing just £15. Career-criminal Oxley was caught by two passers-by who witnessed the incident who chased after her and clung onto her until police arrived. Mrs Bracewell suffered grazes to her knees as a result of the attack. When arrested Ms Oxley showed ‘no remorse’ and told police that Mrs Bracewell’s injuries were her own fault ‘for not letting go’. A drug addict for over 20 years shameful Oxley was tried at Burnley Crown Court, where it was revealed she had 58 previous convictions - mainly for theft – including robbing a 60-year-old man, looting a 92-year old man’s home and stealing distant relative’s purse after they met by chance at hospital. She had also stolen from charity shops. Oxley of Smith Street, Nelson, pleaded guilty to robbery and was jailed for four years. The incident occurred last March after Mrs Bracewell had gone into Nelson town centre shopping at 9am because she thought it would be quiet. Sarah Statham, prosecuting, said the victim had just been to the cash machine and had her purse in her hand. As she was on a pedestrian crossing, Oxley approached the elderly woman for change. When Mrs Bracewell declined Oxley ‘using a lot of force’ tried to grab her purse and Mrs Bracewell struggled and was pulled over. She fell face forward in the middle of the road as Oxley made off with the purse. Eyewitness David Smith was driving his van past when he saw the robbery. He chased Oxley and was joined by David Marshall and together they caught her and ensured she remained until police arrived at the scene. Burnley Crown Court where Oxley was convicted . It was explained to the court that Oxley had had a significant heroin problem for 20 years, had been desperate for cash and accepted she had ‘sunk as low as she had done’ to behave as she did and that she apologised to the victim. In mitigation, Richard Taylor, for Oxley added that she was ‘inadequate in many ways and pathetic in the true sense of the word’. Sentencing, Judge Beverley Lunt told Oxley she had a ‘dreadful record’ and said of the victim: ‘She was left shocked, she was left hurt, she was left bleeding and you just didn’t care. You ran away.’ Judge Lunt made rewards of £250 each from public funds for Mr Smith and Mr Marshall for their ‘bravery and public spiritedness’ in intervening and detaining Oxley. After the case Detective Constable Dave Greenwood of Lancashire Police said: ‘Oxley targeted and preyed on an elderly and vulnerable member of the public.‘She showed no remorse for her despicable actions and I am pleased with the sentence she has been given. ‘I would like to praise the bravery shown by the members of the public who chased after Oxley. Their courageous actions undoubtedly helped officers to make a quick arrest and secure a successful conviction at court. ‘The local community should be proud that people like this live amongst them. They showed true compassion and should be commended for their actions.’","Heroin addict Rebecca Oxley, 36, pulled a 75-year-old grandmother to the floor in a mugging .

"By . Associated Press and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 00:21 EST, 17 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:45 EST, 17 August 2012 . Accused: Drew Peterson, 58, pictured in 2009, has been imprisoned for the past three years awaiting trial for the death of his third wife, Kathleen Savio . A forensic pathologist who performed a second autopsy on Drew Peterson's third wife years after she was found dead in her dry bathtub testified Thursday that there's just one plausible explanation for her death: She was murdered. But under aggressive questioning by the defense, Dr. Larry Blum conceded that some of his well-respected counterparts disagreed and still maintained her death was an accident. A coroner initially ruled Kathleen Savio died in an accidental fall in her bathtub. Her 2004 death was reclassified a homicide only after Peterson's fourth wife, Stacy Peterson, vanished in 2007 and Blum did his new examination. Testifying for a second day Thursday, Blum told jurors he didn't believe a single, fatal slip could explain how Savio had a fresh gash on the back of her head and a pattern of deep bruises on the front of her body. ‘I couldn't see how that could happen,’ Blum testified. Blum, a key witness for the state, was subject to aggressive questioning by the defense later in the day. Over the objections of prosecutors, the judge let defense attorney Ralph Meczyk ask if three other pathologists who reviewed autopsy data still held Savio died accidentally. ‘Despite their opinion, you say homicide?’ the attorney asked.‘I haven't changed my opinion,’ Blum responded. Blum also denied Meczyk's suggestion that he manipulated his autopsy results to mesh with Will County State's Attorney James Glasgow's theory that Savio was murdered. Blum testified earlier that Savio's circular tub also had no edges pronounced enough to cause the two-inch, straight-line wound on her head. Also, the position of Savio's body in the tub - face down and with her feet jammed against the sides of the tub - did not support a theory that she slipped and hit the back of her head, he said. Peterson, a 58-year-old former suburban Chicago police officer, has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder in Savio's death. He is also a suspect in Stacy Peterson's disappearance, although he has never been charged in her case. Authorities presume she is dead, though a body has never been found. Grave charges: Peterson is accused of murdering Kathleen Savio, left. It was initially thought that she had drowned accidentally in the . bathtub, right, but after her body was exhumed her death was ruled as a . homicide . Peterson's attorneys maintain the . original, 2004 autopsy on Savio's body by Dr. Bryan Mitchell was sound . and that his finding of an accidental death holds up. Mitchell died in . 2010. Under cross examination by Meczyk, . Blum conceded that the coroner who deemed Savio's death accidental had . been respected in the field. ‘He did an orthodox and professional autopsy?’ the attorney asked. 'Yes, sir,’ Blum responded. Earlier in the day, Blum testified . that it was ‘extremely rare’ for an otherwise healthy person to . accidentally drown in a bathtub, unless alcohol or drugs were factors, . which, he said, were not in Savio's case. He also described how Savio's body . was partly mummified and skeletonized by the time he examined it in . 2007. He said decomposition was accelerated because water had gotten . into her coffin. But, he said, autopsy work could still be performed. Forensic pathologist Larry Blum told jurors he didn't believe a single, fatal slip could explain how Savio had a fresh gash on the back of her head . Blum said he cut into parts of . Savio's body, including on her hip, to discover that some bruises went . almost to the bone, suggesting a major force caused the injuries. Blum . also looked at photographs from the original autopsy and crime scene to . make his determination. At one point, defense attorney Mecyk . asked Blum if the bruise on Savio's lower left side could have been . caused by banging into a door a suggestion that plunged the courtroom . into a pandemonium as the defense and prosecution started yelling . objections over one another, the station WGNTV reported. Meczyk also repeatedly challenged . Blum about how he could be sure Savio's bruises were freshly made before . she died, suggesting a struggle or beating preceded her death. The . defense attorney suggested there were other indications the bruises were . at least days old. Blum also conceded that no skin or . blood was found under Savio's fingernails, which could have been an . indication that she had been involved in a desperate fight for her life. ‘You would expect that during a struggle, there would be ... DNA or tissue underneath the fingernails?’ Meczyk asked. ‘If the victim scratched the assailant, there may be. Correct,’ Blum responded. During Thursday’s testimony, the . prosecutors suffered a potential blow to its case when the judge barred . them from implying that Peterson tried to stage the death scene by . placing a blue bath towel on the edge of the dry tub shortly after . Savio’s body was discovered, according to the Chicago Tribune. The neighbors who found the woman . dead in the bathroom testified that it was odd there were no towels . around, but a blue towel was later photographed on the tub. Judge Edward Burmila barred . prosecutors from implying that Peterson must have left the towel because . every other witness denied placing it there. On Tuesday, Judge Burmila lambasted . prosecutors who for the third time in as many weeks broached a subject . they were told not to mention in front of jurors -- again raising the . possibility that the case could end with the judge letting the former . police officer go free. Blunders: The judge at Drew Peterson's murder trial on Tuesday lambasted prosecutors, namely Kathleen Patton seen here, who for the third time in as many weeks broached a subject they were told not to mention in front of jurors . Burmila seemed unmoved by repeated . apologies by an attorney for the state and said he would rule Wednesday . on whether to declare a mistrial in a case beset by problems from its . outset. Just two hours before, Burmila had . told prosecutor Kathleen Patton not to ask a witness about whether Savio . had sought an order of protection against Peterson in front of the . jury. When she did, he told jurors to leave the room and berated the prosecutor.'There was one thing I told you not to go into and that's exactly what you did,' Burmila told her. The . error came just as the trial seemed to be going prosecutors' way in . recent days, with the judge granting them permission to present hearsay . evidence central to their case. Hearsay, . or statements not based on the direct knowledge of a witness, is not . usually admissible in court, but Illinois passed a law – known as . 'Drew’s Law' - in the wake of the Peterson case that allows it in . certain circumstances. Prosecutors have acknowledged they have no physical evidence linking . Peterson to Savio's death, so hearsay evidence about what Savio . allegedly said to other people is crucial to their case. In memoriam: Flowers and a small angel statue surround the grave marker of Kathleen Savio, the third wife of Peterson, at the Queen of Heaven Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois . The mistake also came as Patton was questioning one of the state's most compelling witnesses so far. Former . police officer Teresa Kernc had just told jurors about interviewing . Savio in 2002 after Peterson allegedly broke into Savio's home in a SWAT . uniform and repeatedly pushed her to the ground. At one point, Savio allegedly told Peterson, 'Go ahead and do what you came to do: Kill me,' Kernc testified. 'He said, ""Where do you want it?""And she said, ""In the head.'' ' Kernc testified. Peterson then allegedly told Savio to turn her head, which Savio did, Kernc said, based on what Savio told her. 'And then he said, ""I can't kill you,'' she told jurors. Peterson then threw a garage opener to the ground and left. Shortly after Kernc finished telling . that story, Patton turned and asked, 'Did she tell you she wanted to get . an order of protection?' The defense objected to Patton's question, and the judge asked jurors to leave the room. Missing: Peterson, left, is also the chief suspect in the disappearance of his fourth wife, Stacy Peterson, right . Defense . attorneys asked not only for a mistrial but for a 'mistrial with . prejudice,' meaning Peterson could be set free and never be charged . again with Savio's murder. Declaring a mistrial with prejudice is a rare . judicial step. Burmila could also declare a more standard mistrial, . meaning Peterson would be retried later. The judge could also instruct the . jury to disregard what the prosecutor said. If he takes that route, it . could still signal to jurors that prosecutors have -- again -- messed . up, potentially influencing their decision during deliberations. Defense attorney Joel Brodsky cited . other times prosecutors broached prohibited subjects, including when . Glasgow -- just 10 minutes into his opening statement -- referred to an . accusation that Peterson once tried to hire a hit man. 'It . is an avalanche of prejudicial, illegal evidence that is polluting this . jury,' he said. 'To have this many ... errors, how can the defendant . get a fair trial?'","Drew Peterson pleaded not guilty to murdering his third wife, Kathleen Savio, in 2004 .

Syrian rights organizations have called on Columbia University to rescind its admission of dictator Bashar al-Assad’s media adviser, who was accepted into its prestigious international public affairs program with much help from Barbara Walters. The Syrian Expatriates Organization released a statement saying that ‘the prestige of Columbia University is at stake, and must be preserved from being tainted by allowing the admission of a well-known aide to Bashar Assad,’ in reference to Sheherazad ‘Sherry’ Jaafari. Jaafari, who spent the past year advising Assad amid a brutal crackdown on civilians, has remained hidden from public view in the luxurious East 65th Street townhouse owned by the Syrian government, which she shares with her diplomat father, the New York Post has reported. Walters grew close to President Assad's aide Sheherazad Jaafari while organizing the interview, and later emailed contacts at CNN and Columbia University to help her comely new friend . Bashar Jaafari is the Syrian ambassador to the United Nations. In a string of leaked emails between Miss Jaafari . and the celebrated broadcaster, Walters, 82, promised to her help . the 22-year-old secure a job on Piers Morgan's CNN show and win a place . at Columbia University. Walters had heaped praise on Jaafari, calling her ‘brilliant, beautiful’ and addressing her as ‘dear girl’ in the emails. In one email, Ms Walters told 'Sherry' how she had written to CNN host Piers Morgan and his top producer to . 'say how terrific you are' in hopes of helping her get a job at Piers . Morgan Tonight. The young woman responded, writing 'You can never be a better mom to your adopted child (me).' 'Ms. Jaafari was admitted based . solely on the submitted application materials,' associate Columbia dean . Jesse Gale said in response to the controversy surrounding her . acceptance. Jaafari . was one of Assad's closest advisers and one of . three women revealed in an earlier leak to have sent lovestruck emails . to the dictator. Making headlines: Barbara Walters was the first and only American journalist to interview Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in December in the midst of violent uprisings in his country that have left thousands dead . Messages leaked by Syrian rebels in March show her asking another of Mr Assad's advisers to tell him: 'I love him so so so much and that I miss him.' The leak revealed flirtatious and suggestive emails from three admirers, including a provocative photograph of an unknown woman in white lingerie. Walters first met Miss Jaafari when the young woman's father hosted a cocktail party in his New York apartment in March of 2011. The New York Post reports that the two women bonded that evening, and an unidentified diplomatic source said that the then-21-year-old 'was bragging that they had a great relationship after she came to her house for a cocktail party'. That connection came in handy when . the veteran reporter began dealing with Miss Jaafari on a regular basis . leading up the ABC News' exclusive televised interview with the Syrian . leader in December of 2011. In the interview, Miss Walters pressed . the president about the thousands of deaths of Syrian citizens and he . denied having issued any formal command for such force. Ms Walters and Jaafari continued to talk via email long after the interview aired . The Telegraph, . which published the most recent batch of hacked emails between Walters . and Jaafari, reported that the interview was received poorly by . Syrian government officials because it ended up being more harsh on . Assad than they originally expected. Shortly after, Jaafari emailed the broadcaster in a panic, writing that she was 'in so much trouble' over the interview. A . few weeks  later, Miss Jaafari had determined that it was time for her to . get out of Syria and join her father in the U.S.- all the while . remaining extremely loyal to Assad, who she called 'the dude'. In other . emails obtained by The Guardian in March, Jaafari wrote that 'this man is loved by his people'. Upon her move from Syria, Miss Jaafari . applied to Columbia University's School of International and Public . Affairs, and hoped to transition from her job as a press aide to Assad . to a staffer at a major American news outlet. Miss Walters immediately dismissed any . talk of her working for ABC since it would be a breach of journalistic . ethics. Instead, she offered to reach out on behalf of the 'dear girl'. Walters signed emails 'hugs' and 'love' The pair appear extremely close, with . Miss Walters signing her emails with ‘hugs’ and ‘love’ and Ms Jaafari . promising to bring back jewellery from Syria for her so-called adoptive . mother. Their email exchange was obtained by Syrian opposition forces who then passed them on to The Telegraph. Walters emailed Columbia Journalism . School professor Richard Wald, former president of NBC News and vice . president of ABC News, to sing Miss Jaafari's praises. 'She is brilliant, beautiful, speaks five languages. Anything you can do to help?' Ms Walters wrote at the end of January. Mr . Wald responded that while his position at the Journalism School is . unconnected to the School of International and Public Affairs, he would . do his best to help, saying that 'through the Admissions Office network, . I will get them to give her special attention. I am sure they will take . her.' Now, Columbia is saying that while she was accepted, Mr Wald's intervention- if any- had nothing to do with it. 'We cannot comment on an individual applicant’s materials, which are confidential,' Ms Gale said. Mr Wald's son, Jonathan Wald, is the . executive producer of Piers Morgan Tonight, was also the recipient of an . email from Walters.

The Post has reported that admissions officers ignored the warning of 27-year-old Haya Dweidary, the only Syrian in the Columbia international program’s 2012 graduating class specifically asked about Jaafari’s credentials. Columbia University School of Journalism Professor Richard Wald had allegedly promised to help Jaafari get accepted into the international public affairs program . 'I told them they should not let the girl in. She is horrible and supporting the regime,' Dweidary recalled. 'I was sure she wasn’t going to be admitted because of her strong affiliation with the government and all the human-rights violations. It was completely shocking that she was admitted.' Dweidary went on to say that Jaafari 'was helping portray that the . killings are not happening, and for Barbara Walters to support someone . like that, having been in Syria and knowing what is happening, is very . disturbing.' Dweidary told the Daily Beast that one of her friends, a Fulbright film student, was killed in Homs in May while documenting the uprising. The 27-year-old added that more than . 40 of her friends have been imprisoned under Assad’s regime in the last . 15 months, making Jaafari’s acceptance into the program a particularly . painful blow for Dweidary. ‘I’ve . been familiar with the kind of work she does for the government and the . fact that she’s a supporter of the regime to this moment,’ she said. ‘And this is a regime that has killed more than 15,000 civilians.’ In the wake of the emails, Miss Walters released a statement expressing her ‘regret’ in . helping Jaafari get admitted into the highly competitive master’s . program, which rejects four out of five applicants. Mad: Haya Dweidary is a former Columbia student who told the school not to admit Jaafari . 'In . the aftermath (of the Assad interview), Miss Jaafari returned to the U.S. and contacted me looking for a job. I told her that was a serious . conflict of interest and that we would not hire her,' Ms Walters said in . the statement. During her initial response to the . allegations, Walters did not know that the young woman had, in fact, . been accepted to the program, but she still expressed her regret. 'I did offer to mention her to . contacts at another media organization and in academia, though she . didn't get a job or into school.

"By . Amy Oliver and Charles Walford . PUBLISHED: . 09:31 EST, 20 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:04 EST, 21 June 2012 . On trial: Robert Major, 63, is on trial at Aylesbury Crown Court charged with child sex offences involving a father and his son . A scout master who molested a teenager 30 years ago and went on to abuse the man’s son was today starting a 14-year jail sentence. Robert Major's copycat crimes were only exposed when the latest victim told his father he had been abused by the now 63-year-old. The horrified father then revealed his own secret which he had kept bottled-up for three decades. Today the jury found Major guilty of 17 of the 18 charges involving the two men and one other. Aylesbury Crown court heard that Major had been a supervisor at a leisure centre swimming pool in the 1970s when he took advantage of the then schoolboy. He had offered the 11-year-old free swimming sessions before manipulating him into participating in sexual acts in return, it was claimed. In a bizarre twist, the police discovered the historic sexual abuse case on the victim, now 45, when his son came forward alleging sexual assaults by the same man in the late 1990s. Police interviewed the father and were shocked to find he had also suffered at the hands of Major 30 years previously, said prosecutor Mary Loram. She told the court the son, now 27, took 11 years to pluck up the courage to tell his parents and police of his shocking ordeal. She said Major offered him cigarettes and alcohol and let him watch porn at his flat in exchange for sexual favours. This, said Ms Loram, was a mirror image of what his father - who had suppressed the abuse for four decades - had been put through at the hands of Major. He let the father swim at the Tiddenfoot Leisure Centre, in Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, free of charge in return for sexual encounters in the shower room, bar area and changing rooms, it was claimed. The jury heard that Major had been a Scout leader in Leighton Buzzard from the 1960s to the 1980s as well as holding a role as supervisor at the local swimming baths. Ms Loram said: 'The son told his parents in 2009 that the defendant had done things to him sexually. 'Despite support from his parents he didn’t want to go to police at the time but his dad did want to do something about it and contacted police. 'It wasn’t until 2010 that he gave an account to police. Officers went to speak to his parents and his dad was interviewed. 'He (the father) went on to tell police how he knew Robert Major and how he went to the leisure centre as a teenager every day. 'The defendant worked at the pool and would let him into the pool free of charge. He told police how he went to the defendant’s flat and watched a soft porn film with him. 'Once he started looking back at what had happened all that time ago it all came out.' Major is alleged to have let the father swim at the Tiddenfoot Leisure Centre, in Leighton Buzzard, free of charge in return for sexual encounters, it was claimed . The prosecutor added the pair performed sex acts on each other in the bar area of the leisure centre when it was empty, the showers, changing room and in the 'plant room' - an underground room which controlled the pool's temperature. She added the acts also happened one time in the back of the defendant's Ford Cortina when it was parked outside the leisure centre. The father told police he hadn’t thought about these things for 30 years, the court heard. 'Just like his son, he was made to feel this was normal and got cigarettes out of it. What teenager would say no to cigarettes, alcohol and porn?,' Ms Loram said. Thirty years later, in a freak coincidence, Major continued his abusing ways with his former victim’s son,' the court heard. This time it was at an address in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire in the late 1990s into the early 2000s when the boy was between 12 and 16 years. Major denied eight counts of indecent assault, two counts of indecency with a child and one count of rape against the father between 1977 and 1981, as well as two counts of indecent assault, two counts of indecency with a child and one count of buggery against the son between 1998 and 2001, when he appeared at Aylesbury Crown Court, sitting at Amersham, Bucks. He also denied two counts of indecent assault against another man dating back to the late 1970s and early 1980s. The jury heard that Major had been a Scout leader in Leighton Buzzard from the 1960s to the 1980s as well as holding a role as supervisor at the local swimming baths. The jury of seven men and five women took six hours and 55 minutes to return their verdicts. Major, of Steppingstone Place, Leighton Buzzard, was found guilty on all counts except the rape of the father. Judge Simon Davis, on sentencing Major to 14 years, said: 'It is difficult to put into words the damage that you have done to the family. 'You preyed upon these three adolescents between the ages of 10 to teenage years. 'You gave ready accommodation through occasional alcohol, but more often than not, money and sweets so that there was an enticement to people of that age to succumb to your perverted desires. 'Watching (the father’s) evidence it seems to me as it must have to the jury that there was a man who was struggling internally with extraordinary tensions. 'And then finding his son, who had been estranged for years who had returned to the fold, had been abused by you too. 'What was he to do? Keep it inside him which he had done for 30 years? Deal with it, pretending it never happened - the way in which some people deal with this? Or disclose it all? 'I can’t think of a worse case of length of behaviour, type of behaviour and impact. And the fact they were willing participants is not mitigating at all. 'That’s what people like you do. They pick their target and abuse their target.' Major was put on the sex register for life, disqualified from working with children and given a Sexual Offences Prevention Order banning him from being alone with children under 16 years.","Copycat crimes only exposed after son told his father about abuse in late 1990s .

The sequence lasted only two minutes, but the transformation of Buckingham Palace into rows of flats, terraces and council blocks - as Madness played their hit Our House - was one of the more original and intriguing parts of the Diamond Jubilee concert. The effect, seen by 17 million TV viewers, was achieved by a clever light show - and the images projected on to the Palace were of real homes lived in by ordinary people. We tracked down some of the buildings and showed photographs of the TV images to people who live there. Most were surprised - and delighted - to learn of their unexpected moment of fame. The sequence opened with an image of a Seventies council block - in reality a neglected three-storey block of flats in Camberwell, South-East London.

Gambia-born Ousainou Sarr, 45, a restaurant manager who has a flat on the ground floor, saw the designers had cleverly used blue and red lights to disguise the block's crumbling white plaster and paintwork. 'It's amazing,' said Mr Sarr, who didn't recognise his home, even though he was actually in The Mall at the concert. The image of the flats in Benhill Road was used three times in the show and Mr Sarr was so excited that he immediately broke the news to his girlfriend Anna Lucas, 27, a chambermaid, originally from Romania, adding: 'I'm going to tell all my family and friends.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 15:40 EST, 18 June 2012 . A career criminal who admitted to fatally bludgeoning and dismembering a 9-year-old girl he was baby-sitting just days before Christmas was sentenced today to life in prison. Michael Plumadore, from Indiana, last month pleaded guilty to murder, abuse of a corpse and removing a dead body from the scene in the December 22 death of Aliahna Maroney-Lemmon. Prosecutors had considered the death penalty but agreed to life in prison without the possibility of parole in exchange for the guilty plea. Life sentence: Michael Plumadore, left, of Fort Wayne, Indiana, told police he 'killed Aliahna Maroney-Lemmon', right, who weighed just 41lbs, in the early hours of December 22 before dismembering her . Calling the case the 'worst of the . worst,' Allen Superior Court Judge Allen Surbeck accepted that plea deal . Monday and added an extra 36 years: three more years for abuse of a . corpse; three years for moving her body; and 30 years for the murder . charge because Plumadore is a habitual offender. Plumadore, who wore shackles and an orange-and-tan striped jumpsuit, expressed remorse for the girl's death during the hearing. 'I am sorry for the pain and . sorrow I caused so many people. ... I'm truly sorry for the crime I . committed and the pain I caused,' Plumadore said. 'No one should be . exposed to the things I have done.' Plumadore met Aliahna after her . mother, Tarah Souders, moved her three daughters to the rundown trailer . park where he lived to help take care of her dying father. The park, . which holds about two dozen homes, was teeming with convicted sex . offenders, and neighbors say Souders asked her father if any of them – . including Plumadore – could be a threat to her children. Her father assured her the children would be safe. Horrifying: Michael Plumadore poses next to the chair he where says little Aliahna Lemmon was last sleeping. Authorities say he had already killed her and her body parts were in his freezer at the time of this photo . The day Aliahna died, Plumadore . was looking after the third-grader and her 6-year-old sisters at his . mobile home because Souders was ill.  Aliahna weighed just 41 pounds when she died. At last month's hearing, Plumadore . told the judge he killed Aliahna by repeatedly striking her in the head . with a brick. He said he then he cut her body up with a hacksaw. 'I put parts in my freezer and took the rest down to the Marathon station and put them in a Dumpster,' he said. Police found the girl's head, . hands and feet in the freezer at the mobile home where Plumadore had . lived with Aliahna's grandfather, who had died about three weeks . earlier. The other remains were thrown into trash bags and discarded at a . gas station. The other girls weren't harmed. Aliahna's death drew scrutiny to her mother's decision to move to the trailer park and leave the girl in Plumadore's care. Frightening: According to a state website, 15 registered sex offenders live at the mobile home park that numbers about two dozen homes . Sadness: Tarah Souders, mother of Aliahna, is pushed in a wheelchair by step-grandfather David Story and reacts in front of a memorial outside of a mobile home after her daughter's death . Convicted: James Lemmon, Aliahna's grandfather, was convicted of child molesting . Elizabeth Sepponen, a spokeswoman . for the family, told Plumadore at the hearing that the family suffered . not just the pain of the murder, but the judgment of the community. 'My cousin Tarah will forever be judged,' she said. 'You have put a rift in Fort Wayne that I hope someday can be healed.' Surbeck said the death penalty . would have been justified because of the dismemberment and the victim's . age, as well as Plumadore's criminal history. Since 1992, Plumadore has . criminal records in Florida and North Carolina, including convictions . for trespassing and assault, and an Indiana conviction for forgery. 'Any time you have a case where . your client could face the death penalty, the goal is to save his life,' said Plumadore's attorney, Anthony Churchward. Prosecutor Karen Richards said . Aliahna's family asked her not to seek the death penalty. She said she . thought they needed finality. 'I can't think of a more horrific . crime I've seen involving a more innocent victim. I think it transcends . our entire community,' she said. Aliahna's . father, Dawayne Maroney of Centerville, Iowa, said he knew Plumadore . through Ms Souders and had no reason to distrust him. 'I . can't talk about it because I'm still coping with it. It's too hard to . talk about,' he said at the time his daughter was murdered.

This meant Bobby Tyson' was not allowed to attend an end of term disco, a theatre trip and even the annual class photo at the school  in Thurrock, Essex. Traumatised: Bobby Tyson was left in floods of tears and 'deeply humiliated' by his own teachers after he was banned from crucial elements of school life because he has the behavioral disorder ADHD . After being found guilty of discrimination at a tribunal, East Tilbury Infant School, offered 'unreserved apologies' for its 'inadequate' treatment of Bobby. The youngster, now aged 8, was left so traumatised he drew a heartbreaking picture of himself with two teachers and a speech bubble which said - 'I don’t exist'. Bobby was banned by teachers from going to see the Lion King - but only told the day before the trip took place. His mother Holly Tyson, 29, was so outraged by the treatment her son received that she took the matter to tribunal. Banned: Bobby was banned by teachers from going to see the Lion King - but only told the day before the trip took place . Tribunal judge Stewart Hunter has now demanded the school makes a written apology to Bobby and his mother. The judge also ordered all staff at the school to receive training on disability discrimination and demanded the school reviews its special educational needs policy. Ms Tyson said today: 'At no time before I was told Bobby would not be going on the trip was any effort made to discuss this with me. 'If there had been some discussion, I could have suggested that either myself or my sister could accompany him. 'I had been preparing Bobby for this trip for weeks beforehand, telling him how important it was to behave well. 'I believe he made a real effort and he was terribly disappointed when he was told he was not going.' Teachers justified their decision not to take Bobby on their school trip following a safety assessment, which found his condition meant he was prone to impulsive behaviour. Bobby, who also suffers from infantile incontinence, was left sitting in lessons in soiled underwear for hours at a time by teachers - resulting in painful sores. Mr Hunter said the school had failed to manage Bobby’s bowel condition properly and was wrong to exclude him from the trip and other events. He told the tribunal at the Health Education and Social Care Chamber: . 'The effect on Bobby of being in soiled clothes does, in our view constitute placing him at a substantial disadvantage. 'We therefore find Bobby was discriminated against.' East Tilbury Infant School headteacher Shelagh Cosgrow said: 'East Tilbury Infant School prides its self on the support and guidance it gives its pupils. 'Indeed in 2010 Ofsted rated the school outstanding for care, guidance and support. 'However, we accept the tribunal’s findings that errors were made in this instance. 'In compliance with the tribunal, the school has written to the family and apologised. 'It has arranged for staff to have appropriate training and it is reviewing its policy. 'The school is committed to ensuring every child is treated fairly and individual needs are met.' ADHD is the most common behavioural disorder in the UK and affects and estimated 3 - 9 per cent of school-aged children and young people, more often boys than girls. It is a behavioural condition which can cause sufferers to be hyperactive, inattentive and impulsive.","Furious mother Holly Tyson, 29, was so outraged by the treatment her son received at the school in Thurrock, Essex, she took the matter to tribunal .

This is the dramatic moment a brave lifeboat helmsman leaps from a sinking trawler moments after rescuing stranded fishermen. Courageous Pete Slidel threw himself into the English Channel just seconds before the two-man vessel plunged beneath the waves two miles off the coast of Portsmouth, Hampshire. The lifeboat crewman had just rescued the terrified crew but was himself left swimming desperately alongside the sinking ship. Scroll down for video . Jump: A fisherman leaps into the lifeboat (in yellow) but misses his target, ending up in the sea for a few seconds before he is pulled out . Moments to spare: Seconds after lifeboat crewman Pete Slidel jumps from a fishing trawler and into a lifeboat, the vessel founders two miles off the coast of Langstone Harbour, near Portsmouth, yesterday . No hesitation: Just minutes earlier, Mr Slidel boards a sinking fishing trawler that had sent out a Mayday signal . He was then picked up by a second rescue boat while his own lifeboat ferried the fishermen to dry land. Mr Slidel said: 'Even my own entrance onto the vessel was quite dramatic. At that point the boat was still making its own way and taking on water. 'I spoke to the skipper and we proceeded to the nearest land but within seconds the engine had stopped and failed. 'I gave the instruction to leave the vessel immediately. The first man went to jump and literally fell into the lifeboat, which was then pushed away. 'Next was the skipper, he jumped in but again the lifeboat was pushed away. 'The vessel then suddenly started to sink. Seconds before they came close enough to get me I had to abandon the vessel as it started to turn over. 'There was no time for fear - it was just a case of making calm judgements and risk assessments about what could happen next.' Rescued: The skipper of the sinking vessel boards the lifeboat with an armful of important documents . The trawler had been out potting crabs two miles south of Langstone Harbour near Portsmouth when it suddenly started taking on water just before 3pm yesterday afternoon. The lifeboat Norma T was on its way back from routine training when the frantic Mayday call went out over the radio. The crew was on the scene within minutes but by the time they arrived the fishing trawler was already starting to sink on its starboard side and its crew were urgently waving a hand-held flare. Lifeguards said the vessel was only kept afloat by its forward moment when Mr Slidel hurled himself headlong over the rail and onto the deck to save the stranded fishermen. However, as he himself prepared to escape, the engine failed sending the boat plunging below the sealine. Danger: With Mr Slidel still on board, the boat lists to one side and is clearly on the verge of disappearing beneath the waves . Close shave: Filmed from another lifeboat, the vessel sinks seconds after Mr Slidel has jumped into the water and is picked up by his colleagues . RNLI volunteer Mr Slidel was left swimming through rough seas before he was picked up by a nearby boat from Gosport Rescue. However, even after the trying ordeal the life-saver remained at the scene to salvage debris and place a buoy warning other seafarers of the sunken wreckage lying below the waterline. He said: 'It wasn’t until a couple of hours later when I was having dinner round at a friend’s house and reviewing the footage that I started shaking and was overcome by the incident. 'I was just thinking back on how quickly it happened - how quickly the boat went away from underneath us. 'If both lifeboats hadn’t partly been already afloat when we got the call we would have been picking the fisherman up from out of the water.' Mr Slidel today met the fishermen he saved and said they were extremely grateful for his brave actions.","Pete Slidel threw himself .

Florida (2) =6. Oklahoma (2) =6. Mississippi (2) 9. Delaware (1) =9. Idaho (1) =9. Virginia (1) =9. Missouri (1) =9. S. Carolina (1) The 41-year-old, leader of the notorious ‘Texas . Seven’, was killed by lethal injection for gunning down police . officer Aubrey Hawkins during a violent raid on a sports store on Christmas eve 2010. But there are signs that America is edging away from the death penalty. Last year, Illinois became the 16th state to abolish the practice, and a moratorium was announced in Oregon. While Amnesty said Maryland and Connecticut are close to abolition, 36 states still retain the death penalty. Globally, there were more executions last year than in 2010. A surge in Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Yemen is the cause of the rise, Amnesty International said. 'Suzanne Nossel, executive director of Amnesty International USA, said: 'We do not believe that governments should be in the business of executing citizens. 'That's an inappropriate role for the government to play, regardless of the circumstances.' Various countries subject a wide array of crimes to capital punishment. In Iran, death can be the punishment for adultery, sodomy and religious offenses such as apostasy or 'treason against God'. To death: A convicted murderer in Iran awaits his execution. Iran's most usual form of execution is hanging . Meanwhile, blasphemy in Pakistan, 'sorcery' in Saudi Arabia, trafficking in human bones in the Republic of Congo, and economic crimes in China such as selling fake drugs or tainted foods or soliciting deceptive organ transplantation carry the death penalty. China executes thousands of people annually, many more than the rest of the world put together. But figures are a state secret, Amnesty International said, and it has stopped compiling them from public sources because those numbers lead to under-reporting and a gross underestimate of the true total. 1. China (~1,000s) 2. Iran (360) 3. Saudi Arabia (82) 4. Iraq (68) 5. USA (43) 6. Yemen (41) 7. North Korea (30) 8. Somalia (10) 9. Sudan (7+) 10. Bangladesh (5+) Amnesty International challenged Beijing to publish figures on sentencing and executions 'to confirm their claims that various changes in law and practice have led to a significant reduction in the use of the death penalty over the last four years,' the group said. The wave of executions in the Middle East - a 50 per cent regional increase - pushed the global total higher for 2011, with 149 executions more worldwide than in 2010. Iran executed at least 360 people, many of them under harsh new anti-drug laws introduced last year. Iranian executions are usually conducted by hanging, sometimes in public from a construction crane, which Amnesty said led the Japanese construction equipment company Tadano to cut off exports of cranes to Iran last July. Iraq executed 68 people while Saddam Hussein's former foreign minister and deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, awaits his execution this year. Saudi Arabia executed at least 82; and Yemen executed at least 41. Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Yemen accounted for 99 percent of the executions in the Middle East and North Africa, Amnesty said. Although all the Mideast and North African nations had very different governments and political dynamics, the 50 per cent increase in executions came against the backdrop of the Arab Spring protests and upheaval. Chaos in Libya meant that Amnesty was unable to account for any legal executions, though torture, detention and summary killings by pro-government loyalists and by opposition militias who ousted Moammar Gadhafi's regime are widely reported. Gadhafi himself appears to have been videotaped being shot to death by members of a crowd that apprehended him. Amnesty recorded no executions by stoning anywhere in the world in 2011. The rights group criticized Iran, North Korea, Saudi Arabia and Somalia for staging public executions. Japan, which also retains capital punishment, recorded no executions for the first time in 19 years, Amnesty reported. India also conducted no executions for the seventh year in a row and Pakistan none for a third year, Amnesty said. Sri Lanka also had no executions in 2011, but 362 people were on death row. Sri Lanka has sought to hire a hangman and received several applications for the job, Amnesty quoted Sri Lanka's Treasury department as reporting.","USA executed 43 prisoners in 2011 .

Kahlid Sheik Mohammed didn't crack after CIA interrogators pushed him around, slapped him, physically intimidated him or waterboarded him 183 times. The mastermind of the September 11 terrorist attacks was finally spilled his information about upcoming al-Qaeda plots after he was kept awake for 180 hours -- seven and a half days -- straight. A new book released by the CIA's former National Clandestine Service director, who oversaw the interrogation of Mohammed and other captured terrorists, revealed that the CIA used tough techniques, torture by some definitions, to extract information that helped thwart future attacks on the United States. Defiant: Khalid Sheik Mohammed, the mastermind of the September 11 attacks, was defiant in his court appearance Saturday . José Rodriguez Jr, revealed in 'Hard Measures' that US officials were only able to extract the information from Mohammed because they subjected him to such harsh interrogation. 'Even with waterboarding, he was counting on his fingers, because he knew we would stop at 10, so he wasn’t terribly intimidated by that,' Mr Rodriguez told the New York Post. 'It was the sleep deprivation that finally got him.' US authorities captured Mohammed in 2003 in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, and hid him at a CIA 'black site' for his interrogation. When they asked him about future terrorist plots, he said only, 'soon you will know.' Mohammed and five other men accused in the 2001 attacks on New York and Washington DC appeared at a military tribunal Saturday. Families of victims of the terror plot watched the proceedings in Guantanamo Bay via video link. Inside: Jose Rodriguez Jr was the CIA's director of the National Clandestine Service and oversaw interrogation of suspected terrorists . Mohammed was defiant and refused to answer the judge's questions. He wasn't so tight-lipped after CIA interrogators kept him awake for more than a week. Rodriguez has admitted to destroying 92 tapes of the interrogations, saying he was protecting his agents and the reputation of the United States. Interrogators tried several unsuccessful techniques to get Mohammed, 48, to spill his knowledge, the Rodriquez writes. Captured: Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was subjected to waterboarding 183 times, but never divulged information as a result of the procedure . He was stripped naked and forced to stand in his cell. Then he was given only Ensure protein shakes for nutrition and made to wear a diaper. When humiliation didn't work, Mohammed's captors got physical with other 'corrective techniques.' He was 'walled' -- pushed around in a small room so that his shoulder blades hit the plywood walls with a 'boom.' Interrogators grabbed him by the collar and yanked him -- the 'attention grab.' They squeezed his face been their hands and held it still -- the 'facial hold.' And they slapped him in the face, specifically between the chin and the bottom of the earlobe -- the 'insult slap.' Finally he was waterboarded -- water was poured on his face while he was tied down, simulating drowning. Operatives did this 183 times. The 30 other CIA detainees broke down much more easily, usually the first time an interrogator slapped them. Al-Qaeda operatives were trained that their American captures would never touch them, the Post reported. But none of those techniques ever broke Mohammed, a Kuwaiti who studied  in Greensboro, North Carolina. He still claimed he didn't speak any English and knew only Urdu, the language of Muslim Indians and Pakistanis. Finally, the CIA resolved to keep Mohammed awake. He was restrained in stress positions, being forced to stand or squat in an uncomfortable and tiring pose. Interrogators told him he would be allowed to sleep as soon as he politely asked them if he could lay down. It took 180 hours, Rodriquez said, but Mohammed finally broke and began spilling information in torrents. Still, Rodriquez says Mohammed was treated better than an American could have expected in the hands of al-Qaeda. 'It was much kinder than anything he would have done to an American captive, like Danny Pearl,' he told the Post. Pearl, a Wall Street Journal reporter, was kidnapped in Pakistan by 2002. He was beheaded on video by Mohammed. The intelligence collected from Mohammad because of the interrogation techniques led to several terrorist plots because uncovered, including a 2003 plan to replicate the September 11 attacks on the West Coast -- this time with southeast Asian shoe-bombers aboard planes.",New book by retired CIA official reveals waterboarding and other 'enhanced interrogation' didn't work on September 11 mastermind .

Carol and Chris Broad were devastated when a driver smashed into their house in Barry, South Glamorgan, four years ago, causing £30,000 of damage and writing off the family car. Now they are in shock after a second driver ploughed through their front garden and into the wall of their living room - forcing them to stay in a hotel while builders assess the damage. Lucky escape: Carol Broad, pictured, said she could have been killed in the smash - the fifth to involve her house and a neighbour's . Speaking today, Mrs Broad, 52, said she could have been killed in the smash - the fifth to involve her house and a neighbour's. She said: 'The only saving grace is that it happened when we were asleep upstairs. 'Bricks came flying ten metres . through our front window and landed right where I sit watching TV. 'If it . had happened in the evening, I’d be dead.' Flashback: A Golf caused £30,000 of damage and wrote off the family car on News Year's Day 2008 .

I just reached for the phone and dialled 999. Smash: Chris and Carol Broad discuss the damage to their home from the latest collision with MP Alun Cairns . 'Chris looked out the window and did his best Victor Meldrew impression - ""I don’t believe it"".' The cleaner said her next-door neighbours Monty and Janet Starr's house has been hit twice - by a . motorcycle about 30 years ago and a car ten years ago. She said: 'We'd . seen some near-misses over the years, but you just hope it’s not going . to happen to you. 'This is now the fifth time these two houses have been . hit.' In another incident before the Broads moved in, a car crashed through the . garden wall of their house and landed on its roof. Barely recovered: Chris and Carol Broad were still trying to get over a previous smash when a second car hit their home in Barry, South Glamorgan . Mrs Broad and her electrical wholesaler husband, 48, had barely recovered from the previous smash in 2008, when a Volkswagen Golf careered into their three-bed semi in the early hours of New Year's Day. The couple's brand-new Toyota Celica, worth £22,000, was written off. Recalling the incident, Mrs Broad said: 'It was a horrendous start to the year. 'We were in bed at 6.30am when we heard this almighty crash and the entire house shook. 'The Golf had smashed through our garden wall, mounted our car, and ploughed into the porch and extension.' They bought the house in 2001 and were warned by neighbours soon after moving in that the location was an accident blackspot. Damage to their home from the first smash took 12 months to repair, but Mr Broad says he has never recovered from the mental trauma. Clear-up: Carol Broad has been busy sweeping glass from between stone blocks littering her living room after a car hit her home . He said today: 'I haven't had a proper night's sleep in four years. 'It's there in my mind all the time - I've just been waiting for it to happen again.' The couple's home - opposite a school on a busy T-junction - is in a 20mph zone. But they say drivers regularly reach speeds of 60 and 70mph descending the hill facing the house. 'They brake at the last minute - or sometimes not soon enough, it seems,' said Mrs Broad. 'The council put a speed bump in after the last crash - but it just acts like a launch ramp. 'It's only a matter of time before someone is killed.' The latest smash happened at 1.15am on Saturday as the couple and their 15-year-old daughter, Christy, were asleep in bed. They now face four months in temporary accommodation while builders repair the damage. Mrs Broad said: 'I can't imagine we’d ever be able to sell this house now even if we wanted to move. 'I don't even know if we'll be able to get insured again after this.' Local MP Alun Cairns, who visited the couple to examine the damage, said: 'Chris and Carol have experienced the worst possible nightmare for the second time. 'The road alterations made after the last accident are clearly deficient.' South Wales Police said a 29-year-old man is due to appear before Cardiff Magistrates on June 20 charged with a number of motoring offences.","Carol and Chris Broad are staying at a hotel after a car ploughed through their front garden and into their living room wall .

A cheating wife had her wealthy husband killed by three men before stepping over his dying body to collect her drugs, a court heard. Charlotte Collinge, 44, is accused of recruiting the men to kill her husband Clifford, 61, with a 4ft-long iron clamp. The court heard she recruited Stephen Shreeves, 40, Robert Proud, 36, and Kevin Dale, 27, to attack her former newsagent husband on October 8 last year. After the brutal beating, which left Clifford with 46 separate injuries including a fractured skull, Collinge allegedly then calmly stepped over his bleeding body to pick up her stash of cannabis. Peter Joyce QC, prosecuting, said: 'In order to get the cannabis she had to go over or past her husband’s body.' The court heard that Mr Collinge’s death was caused by a head injury, fractured ribs a collapsed lung and a cardiac air embolism. He had 46 separate, individual or groups of injuries. Injuries to the back of his head were consistent with the use of a weapon such as a clamp recovered from the couple’s home. Nottingham Crown Court heard Collinge - described as a sexual exhibitionist - plotted to kill her husband so she would be entitled to their £500,000 home in the village of Market Warsop, Nottinghamshire. Charlotte Collinge, 44, and the three men she is accused of hiring to kill her husband are all on trial at Nottingham Crown Court . Earlier the court had been told how Shreeves, Dale and Collinge met at a pub in Warsop before buying lager and wine at a shop. All three, who were later joined by Proud, then went to the couple’s home where Mr Collinge was enjoying an evening with pal Stephen ‘Stan’ Boardman. Mr Boardman claimed the men were shouting at Clifford Collinge and calling him an offensive name before the alleged attack. He claims he was then struck on the back of the head before being kicked unconscious by the men. Mr Joyce added: 'Mr Boardman spoke of being hit on the back of the head, slashed on the wrist and being kicked and stamped on. 'He heard his friend, the deceased, moaning and being dragged into the kitchen area before he lost consciousness.' Collinge and Shreeves, of Church Warsop, and Dale and Proud, of Warsop, all deny murder. The three men also deny assaulting Mr Boardman. The trial continues on Monday.","Charlotte Collinge, 44, is accused of hiring three men to kill her husband Clifford, 61 .

The extraordinary development has seen a ‘Vinbovin’ label of meat established which is already being championed by some of the best restaurants in Paris. It follows an experiment in Lunel-Viel, in the southern Herault region of France, which saw three cows fed local wine for four months. Enjoy it while you can... Bovine fed on wine were found to be 'happy' and ended up producing exceptionally succulent meat . Vinbovin: It follows an experiment in southern France which saw three cows fed local wine for four months (file picture) Jean-Charles Tastavy, who came up with the idea, said the two Angus and one Camargue were initially fed the wine in a mix of barley, hay and grapes. It soon became clear that they were ‘happy cows’ who ended up producing an exceptionally succulent meat. Outlining how he encouraged the cows to enjoy a tipple, Mr Tastavy said: ‘For each animal, alcohol intake should be equivalent to the amount recommended by health authorities for a man – namely two or three glasses of wine a day. In the case of cows, this amounts to between a litre and a litre-and-a-half a day.’ Championed in Paris: The experiment has led to a 'Vinbovin' label of meat . After a rough mix of grapes and water, the cows were allowed wine from Saint-Genies des Mourgues, a Languedoc village near Montpellier renowned for its vineyards. ‘The cattle loved what was on the menu and eat it with relish,’ said Claude Chaballier, owner of the farm where the experiment started last year. Referring to the Muscat grape, Mr Chaballier added: ‘I thought that next time we may try Muscat so as to give the meat a more musky taste.’ Laurent Pourcel, a Michelin-starred chef, is among those enthusing about the ‘luxury meat’ saying: ‘It has a very special texture – beautiful, marbled and tender, and which caramelizes during cooking. All the best Parisien restaurants will take it.’ Japanese Kobe beef, which is made with beer, is currently considered among the best in the world, but the possibility of cows enjoying vintage wine will guarantee an even more luxurious product. There is a down side, however: the introduction of wine into the feed of the Lunel-Viel cows tripled the cost of their feed, adding up to 80 pounds to the cost of a prime beef cut.","Extraordinary development has led to the creation of 'Vinbovin' label of meat .

Scientists have today released a new concoction which could help clear up the mess of an oil spill - and it involves the types of ingredients you might normally find on a dessert dish. Following concerns about the health and environmental effects of oil dispersants following the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010, scientists described a new dispersant made from edible ingredients that both breaks up oil slicks and keeps oil from sticking to the feathers of birds. Reporting on the mixture, Lisa Kemp, from the University of Southern Mississippi, told . the . American Chemical Society, said: 'Each of the ingredients in our dispersant is used in common food products like peanut butter, chocolate and whipped cream.' Clean up: Fire boats battle the blazing remnants of the off shore oil rig Deepwater Horizon, off Louisiana, in April 2010 . An oil-covered bird is pulled from the sea following the Deepwater catastrophe: The new mixture could stop such situations . Kemp, a PHD graduate, said: 'Other scientists are working on new oil dispersants and absorbents, but nothing that's quite like ours. 'It not only breaks up oil but prevents the deposition of oil on birds and other objects, like the ingredients in laundry detergent keep grease from redepositing on clothing in the rinse cycle. 'Birds can sit in slicks of the dispersed oil, they can dive through it and take off and flap their wings, and the oil will fall off.' Kemp's colleague, Robert Lochhead, PhD, developed the concept for the new dispersant, and the research team now has moved the material from concept to a prototype dispersant suitable for testing on actual oil spills. The new formula can stop oil clinging to the skin and feathers of wildlife - potentially saving hundreds of thousands of avian lives . Lochhead said the new dispersant is based on scientific principles established decades ago during the development of modern laundry detergents. One ingredient, for instance, is a special polymer that sticks to the surface of oil droplets to keep them from sticking to the feathers of sea birds. Similar polymers in laundry detergents keep oil and grease removed during the wash cycle from getting back on clothing during the rinse cycle. That feature in the new dispersant would be critical for minimising damage to wildlife and beaches, Kemp noted. When detergents are used to remove oil that has coated fur or feathers, it defeats their natural waterproofing effect, leaving birds less buoyant and more susceptible to hypothermia. Once the catastrophe has been stopped, a clean-up could be easier due to the dessert mixture . Birds can also eat the oil as they try to clean themselves, causing internal damage. By some estimates, almost 225,000 birds died in this way after being covered in oil from the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill off the coast of Alaska. Another important advantage, Kemp noted, is the ease of quickly obtaining large amounts of ingredients, even ton quantities, for making the dispersant at reasonable cost. She envisioned agencies like the U.S. Coast Guard keeping small amounts on hand for first response, with larger quantities being quickly made as necessary. With funding from the National Science Foundation, Kemp helped the group move from the prototype they had developed in the lab to a version that would be ready to be tested and approved for use with future oil spills. The group used a robotic device to quickly screen thousands of possible combinations until they settled on a winning formula. The team had support from large chemical manufacturers, including The Dow Chemical Company, Archer Daniels Midland Company and Croda International for ingredient selection and supply. In order to move to commercialization of this technology, it will now be necessary to seek partners and end-use customers with interest in testing the product.","Detergent-style mixture breaks up slicks in the ocean and stops oil sticking to sea-birds .

My confession: Barry McOwen, 67, confessed to drugging and molesting three young girls on the second day of his trial . A 67-year-old man tearfully confessed to sexually abusing three little girls in a surprising turn of events. Barry McOwen, of Upper Salford, Pennsylvania, shockingly took the witness stand before testimony began on the second day of his trial. During his confession, McOwen read from a prepared statement that he pleaded guilty to the charges of rape of a child, sexual abuse, and dissemination and possession of child pornography. Parents of the three victims who were in the courthouse said they were relieved that neither they nor their daughters would have to relive horrific memories while testifying. According to Philly.com, McOwen abused the three girls in his care – aged four to ten at the time – between 2006 and 2011. He said he committed the crimes while babysitting the three girls. According to testimony from the first day, he drugged the girls with Benadryl, what he called ‘half a roofie’ and ‘my special juice,’ according to The Mercury. Scroll down for video . Taken away: McOwen was immediately sentenced to 50.5 to 101 years for his crimes and was escorted out by court officers, his head held low . House of horror: McOwen lived in this converted apartment building outside of Philadelphia; police found thousands of pornographic pictures on his computer . In fact, McOwen showed little emotion while Assistant District Attorney Samantha Cauffman made her opening statements during the trial’s first day. She accused him of being a ‘thief in the night’ who stole ‘their innocence again and again.’ Drugged: He said he gave the girls Benadryl, calling it 'my special juice' Judge William R. Carpenter accepted the plea agreement, and sentenced McOwen to 50.5 to 101 years behind bars. Ms Cauffman told the Montgomery News that though shocking, she was pleased with the trial’s outcome. ‘I think justice was done,’ she said, adding: ‘This man should never see the light of day again, and that was my ultimate goal.’ According to the Mercury, McOwen initially pleaded not guilty to the charges, and so the court went ahead with the first day of testimony. County Detective Mary Anders told the jury that authorities identified the three victims through clothing they were wearing in pictures seized from McOwen’s computer. Authorities recovered explicit online chats where McOwens would talk about 'sleep assaulting' the girls, bragging to his friends about his so-called conquests. They also found thousands of pornographic images of children. Det. Anders told the court that the girl’s parents were also asked to identify whether or not the girl in the picture was their daughter. ‘They were both pretty distraught,’ she said. Family members of the three girls who were in the courtroom wept after hearing McOwen’s confession – meaning they were spared the horror of hearing of their children’s abuse all over again.","In surprise move, 67-year-old Barry McOwen took the stand and read a prepared confession .

A mother-of-four has shed six stone after she living on a diet of fruit and vegetables for two years - to stop her smelling like fish. Claire Rhodes, 34, has a rare metabolic disorder called Trimethylaminuria (TMAU), also known as fish odour syndrome, where the body can’t break down trimethylamine, which is found in certain foods including milk and eggs. It causes the chemical to build up in her system before it is released in her sweat, urine, and breath, giving off a strong fishy odour. Claire with her daughter Ruby before she was diagnosed (left) and today after her new diet saw her shed 6st . Claire was diagnosed two years ago but her unfortunate odour has been following her around since she was in her early twenties. Strangers have shouted at her in the street and she said it even forced to quit her job as a care assistant in a residential home. But now thanks to her extreme diet, Claire has been able to keep her fishy odour under control and at the same time lose weight. Claire, from York, said: 'You’re supposed to have other things in small amounts but they still make me stink. 'So I only eat fruit and vegetables. It’s made me lose six stone. 'The diet does get me down but I have got to stick to it. I wouldn’t be able to go out if I didn’t. I’d be too embarrassed. 'People don’t look at me or comment as much now. I’m starting to live again.' Claire, who can’t smell her odour, was having up to ten showers a day after family and friends started commenting on her fishy whiff. She said: 'One day, I was cleaning my teeth just before I was about to go out and my sister told me I should do it at least three times because I stank. 'I brushed it off. I thought it was a typical sister thing. 'More people started commenting on it. It really started getting to me. That’s when I started to become really obsessive with cleaning.' Fish free: Claire with some of the food she enjoys now . When she went to see her doctor, they did various tests, which all came back negative. Claire’s doctor concluded she suffered from body odour and halitosis. She said: 'I was in and out of my GPs every month. I think they thought I was a hypochondriac. 'I thought it was coming from my teeth so I lied to my dentist and said I was in pain so he removed some of them. 'I was brushing my teeth 20 times a day. I was brushing so hard my gums were receding.' Around the same time, she started having panic attacks and for a year, she only left the house when she had to go to work. Claire said: 'I was sick of people looking at me. People would shout at me to brush my teeth. 'People said I smelled of poo, it’s not nice being told that. 'I was working nights in a residential home and when I did hand over, the rest of the staff would move to the other end of the room. 'I knew they were thinking: ‘she doesn’t wash.’ They used to laugh behind my back.' Claire says she locks herself in her house for the weekend if she fancies a takeaway . Claire even contemplated suicide because of it and she was put on anti-depressants as well as having counselling. However, after watching a programme about someone with fish odour syndrome, Claire was finally diagnosed with the disorder. She said: 'As soon as I saw it on the television, I though I bet I have got that. By then, my doctor was sick of me and said I wouldn’t because it’s so rare. 'She agreed to do a test though and when the result came back positive she apologised. It was a real relief to get a diagnosis. I was so happy.' A dietician has put Claire on a strict diet and warned her to cut out any foods that make her disorder worse. Most foods cause her to stink, including some fruit and vegetables, so Claire has limited her diet to strawberries, pears, carrots, turnips, potatoes and salad. Although, she can eat honey and rice in small amounts as well as bread, but only if it is freshly baked. She said: 'Sometimes I treat myself to a takeaway on a Friday night just lock myself away all weekend.' Claire said her four children, Danielle, 17, Connor, 13, Ruby, six, and two-year-old Harrison have helped her stay strong. She said: 'If it wasn’t for them, I wouldn’t be here.' Dr Robin Lachmann, a consultant in Metabolic Medicine at University College Hospital in London, said said: 'Trimethylaminuria is caused by an inability to break down trimethylamine in the liver. 'There is an inherited form of the condition called Primary Trimethylaminuria. It’s caused by a faulty gene but that is extremely rare. 'In most patients this gene is normal and we think that trimethylamine builds up due either to the fact that the enzyme has stopped working properly, which might be to do with hormone levels, or that the bacteria in their gut are producing too much trimethylamine for the enzyme to cope with. 'There’s no cure but treatment aims to reduce trimethylamine levels in the body and control the symptoms. 'We do this by trying to limit the amount of trimethylamine entering the body. We recommend a special diet which is low in trimethylamine and in another chemical called choline, which can be converted to trimethylamine by gut bacteria. 'We also use a combination of courses of antibiotics and probiotics to try to reduce the numbers of trimethylamine-producing bacteria in the gut. 'Most patients can reduce their trimethylamine levels and their symptoms with these sorts of treatment.'",Claire was shouted at in the street and bullied at work because of her body odour .

A woman has called for her house to be knocked down after it was hit by passing vehicles 50 times in ten years. Hairdresser Sandra Worrall is begging Somerset County Council to buy her home in Wheddon Cross so they can bulldoze it and widen the road. The property has suffered thousands of pounds worth of damage and is now uninsurable against impact. Constant danger: Sandra Worrall's house has been struck by passing motorists 50 times in a decade, including five times in one month . Mrs Worrall said: ‘I don’t want to move from here but I just don’t know how much more I can take. I’m a nervous wreck.’ Since she and her family moved in 12 years ago, the house has been struck by lorries an average of four times a year. Last October, it took five hits in one month. The latest incident, last week, saw part of the roof and corner wall of her son’s bedroom taken off. 'We’ve been raising this problem for years but we have got nowhere with Somerset County Council,' she said. 'This junction simply cannot take 16-wheel vehicles - in fact even the 12-wheel ones struggle to negotiate it. 'I’m absolutely fed up and a nervous wreck over this and I want something done about it.' Damaged: A crumbling section of Sandra Worrall's house, which has now been rendered uninsurable because it has been hit by drivers so many times . Plea: Sandra Worrall has seen her house, on the corner of this junction, smashed by passing cars an incredible 50 times in the last decade . Mrs Worrall has told the county council that she wants large vehicles diverted to another route. 'Failing that I’ve asked the council if it will buy our house, knock it down and improve the road,' she said. 'We’ve been hit at 4am in the morning, late at night - in fact at all times of the day and night. 'And sometimes the drivers involved can be quite aggressive and refuse to give their names. ‘We really need a structural engineer to assess the current state of the building but we can’t afford to get one in because we can’t get insurance.' Mrs Worrall is begging highways officials to help protect her home, after the latest accident which saw part of the roof above her son's bedroom take off . Although there are signs at the junction advising vehicles Sandra insists these are ambiguous and do not make the difficulties clear. 'I’m just so fed up with the situation and there seems no way out of it,' she said. A county council spokesman said the authority was sorry to hear about the latest incident. 'In recent months we have carried out some works to the road surface on he B3224 outside this house to assist with matters,' he said. 'The county council is working with local councillors and the parish council to see if improvements can be made to the road signage to improve the situation here.'","Sandra Worrall's home has suffered thousands of pounds of damage .

"By . Rebecca Camber . UPDATED: . 11:41 EST, 24 January 2012 . On trial: Asil Nadir arrives at the Old Bailey, London, with his wife, Nur . It has been nearly 19 years since he famously fled British justice. But yesterday Asil Nadir finally went on trial for allegedly stealing £150million to fund his luxury lifestyle. The 70-year-old is accused of plundering his Polly Peck business empire to pay for lavish properties, cars and gifts for himself and his family, causing the firm to collapse nearly 22 years ago. The tycoon, who had at his disposal . five company cars including Bentleys and a Ferrari Testarossa, as well . as a company aeroplane, then fled as fraud investigators closed in. On . the eve of his trial in May 1993 he jetted off to his native Northern . Cyprus where he set up home. It . was not until August 2010 that Nadir flew back to London and was . re-arrested. Yesterday the former fugitive entered the Old Bailey . grinning as he prepared to go into the dock for the first time to face . 13 charges of theft. Nadir . stopped to shake hands and wave at supporters after arriving in a . presidential-style cavalcade. He was flanked by minders and accompanied . by his glamorous second wife Nur, 27. The . defendant sat calmly as the court heard how he raided the firm's . accounts to splash out on a string of million pound properties and . luxuries such as a new Mercedes for his first wife Ayshegul, cash for . his son Birol and livestock for a 'model farm' on a country estate in . Leicestershire. He even used the stolen cash to pay off his tax bill and debts, it was alleged. Nadir . is facing trial over 13 specimen counts of theft amounting to . £33million and $2.5million. But prosecutor Philip Shears, QC, said the . 'much bigger picture' was that he stole £146million and $6.4million in a . total of 64 transfers. The cash was allegedly taken between August 1987 and August 1990 from three accounts held by Polly Peck International (PPI), a major international conglomerate which had more than 200 subsidiaries trading in food, electronics, textiles and leisure and housed the Del Monte fruit business. Nadir is said to have ordered his henchmen to take out bags of bank notes, often totalling £100,000, from banks which he 'dishonestly routed away to benefit himself, his family or associates'. Mr Shears told jurors: 'Mr Nadir was chairman and chief executive of PPI. He was a man who wielded very considerable power over its operations and management and that of its subsidiaries, particularly in Northern Cyprus. In the dock: A court drawing shows Nadir on the opening day of his trial, where the Old Bailey heard he stole £150m from his business empire . 'Dishonest': Nadir and his wife Nur at court, where Nadir is on trial over allegations he stole £34million . 'We say he abused that power and helped himself to tens of millions of pounds of PPI's money. 'The time span of the counts is . between 1987 and 1990. That is a long time ago. Why are we trying . matters so long ago? The answer is simple. He was due to stand his trial . in late 1993 but in May of 1993 he fled the country to Northern Cyprus, . thus leaving the jurisdiction, only to return in August 2010. 'The funds were used in a variety of ways for the benefit of Nadir himself, his family and his associates.' Exit: Nadir leaves court this evening following the conclusion of the day's proceedings at the Old Bailey . The jury heard that Nadir hid . £7.5million he siphoned off from his firm in his mother, Safiye's, bank . accounts. The rest of the stolen cash went through a complex series of . transactions through companies in Switzerland and the Bahamas and a bank . he owned in Northern Cyprus, it was said. When the company folded owing more . than £550million, administrators found that the vast majority of cash . was held in Northern Cyprus. By December 1989, £202.6million – 81 . per cent of all Polly Peck's cash balances – was held by its Turkish and . Northern Cyprus companies. By the end of June 1990 this had risen to . £305.8million. When questioned about the cash . transfers, Nadir allegedly told his board it made good business sense . and that he needed to pay citrus growers for produce. Shortly before the firm collapsed in . October 1990, Nadir increased his salary from £200,000 to £350,000, the . court heard. Mr Shears said: 'When the administrators went to Northern . Cyprus they effectively found no cash at all, just a black hole. We say . there is a perfectly good explanation for that – it had gone. Mr Nadir . had stolen it.' The jury heard that Nadir was the . dominant force in the company which he built up from an ailing textiles . firm in the early 1980s. Mr Shears said: 'He directed its . affairs in an autocratic manner and refused to tolerate rival sources of . power in the management or to accept constraints upon his freedom of . action.' Unlike other businesses, PPI operated . with a single signatory system where only one member of the board could . authorise the transfer of funds as Nadir refused to 'surrender the power . to transfer funds'. But he relied on help from his alleged . accomplice, Elizabeth Forsyth, his 'personal financial officer' who was . managing director of South Audley Management (SAM) which ran most of . the money transactions. Jason Davies, another director of SAM, also . 'provided assistance to Nadir in his dishonest enterprise', the court . heard. They allegedly worked together to help . Nadir use PPI money to secretly buy £26.2million in PPI shares to prop . up its share price, which allowed the company to borrow more from banks, . helped maintain the value of Nadir's own shareholding and prevented . lenders forcing the sale of his personal stock. The court heard that Nadir also used the cash to invest in businesses he owned or controlled. They included a newspaper and . publishing company in Northern Cyprus, a Swiss computer firm he used to . get a Swiss residence permit, a Turkish airline, Baggrave Farm – a . country estate in  Leicestershire – and Burley on the Hill, a hotel . development project in Rutland. Nadir, of Belgravia, denies 13 counts of theft. The trial continues.","Nadir denies 13 charges against him at start of Old Bailey trial .

Speaking out: Iain Duncan Smith last night dismissed claims that welfare cuts are causing 'social cleansing' Iain Duncan Smith last night dismissed claims that welfare cuts are causing ‘social cleansing’. The Work and Pensions Secretary spoke out after a Labour council suggested it would have to move benefit claimants hundreds of miles because of a new cap on payments. Mr Duncan Smith said he was ‘appalled and astonished’ by the allegations, adding that there were ‘thousands’ of cheaper properties where tenants could be housed closer to home. Newham Council in East London said it was writing to more than 1,000 housing associations around the country – including one in Stoke-on-Trent 160 miles away – to try to find accommodation for families applying under the new rules. As part of its measures to cut the spiralling welfare bill, the Government has introduced weekly caps on housing benefit of between £250 a week for a one-bedroom flat and £400 a week for a four-bedroom property. The Coalition has also decided to cap total welfare payments at £26,000 a year. Ministers say it is completely unacceptable that those on welfare have been provided with taxpayer-funded properties costing as much as £100,000 a year to rent. They say that like many of those in employment, they should have to live in more affordable areas. But Newham mayor Sir Robin Wales insisted spiralling rents in his borough – which is hosting the Olympics – and the housing benefit cap meant it could no longer afford to put up tenants in the private rented sector. Newham Council has written to the Brighter Futures Housing Association in Stoke - 170 miles away - to ask them to 'lease' homes to it and take on 500 families . Newham's Mayor Robin Wales said aside from thousands of people needing to be housed in the Olympic borough, there was a problem with overcrowding . ‘We are one of the poorest areas in the country, we have massive overcrowding, the people who are here we are trying to deal with,’ he said. ‘What happens? The Government, they pursue policies that push people out from the centre of London out to here. ‘There just isn’t the capacity to deal with them and we end up chasing round the country trying to deal with people who are in need. It is not a policy that I am particularly keen on.’ Gill Brown, chief executive of Brighter Futures in Stoke-on-Trent, one of the housing organisations contacted by Newham, said: ‘I think there is a real issue of social cleansing going on.’ A proposal sent to Tory-controlled Westminster City Council by one of its private providers, Smart Housing Group, suggests rehousing ‘150 people within the next 12 or so months’ as far away as Derby. Croydon Council in South London has said it is seeking to rent private accommodation in Hull, while Waltham Forest, in North-East London, has moved a small number of families to Luton. Mr Duncan Smith said the claims from Newham Council were  ‘nonsense’ and that there were ‘thousands of houses’ within a few miles which fell within the cap. A council estate in Canning Town in Newham where Mr Wales said there is one case where there's 38 people living in one property and 16 of them are children . Ministers said there was a £190million fund available to help councils manage the reforms and insisted that even after the cap, families can still claim up to £21,000 a year towards their rent. Mr Duncan Smith said the cap had been in place since April 2011 and ‘every other council’ was ‘managing’. ‘We inherited a housing benefit bill that was out of control,’ he added. ‘We need to get people into housing they can afford to go to work from, so the taxpayer doesn’t have to foot that bill. I suspect this is a little political at a time of local elections.’ A Government source said: ‘These reforms have been up and running for over a year, and any suggestion of “social cleansing” is patently ridiculous and factually inaccurate.’","Newham Council, in East London, blamed Government cuts to housing benefit for need to move tenants .

'Lisa Filth': Stapley advised a friend to leave town within minutes of an assault being reported . A lesbian police community support officer known to friends as 'Lisa Filth' has been jailed for passing on confidential information to other gay people in her area. In the worst data breach Lisa Stapley, 39, who was recruited by North Wales Police because she is gay, tipped off a lesbian friend wanted for assault with a text saying: 'Get out of Wrexham, the police are looking for you.' Jailing her for ten months at Mold Crown Court, Judge Philip Hughes said that she had breached trust after she admitted four charges of misconduct in public office. The worse incident was when, within . five minutes of an assault complaint being made, Stapley sent a string of . text messages to a friend telling her to get out of town. She . sent a total of 19 text messages to that friend while meant to be . on duty, also suggesting an alibi strategy for her to use if the police caught up with . her. Judge Philip Hughes . said that she had provided confidential police information to other . people but added there was no financial gain. In three of the four charges, while serious, she was not advancing . any criminal purpose for anyone else or prejudicing any police . operation. In those instances she could be described as 'misguided and naive', the judge said,' adding, 'By doing so you helped your friend evade the attention of the police'. 'That is the most serious aspect of your offending. 'It was a gross breach of trust. 'The court has a duty not only to punish you but to send out a . message to those who work in the police, either as police officers or . community support officers, that such behaviour is so serious that only . immediate custody can be imposed,' he said. There were three other breaches. Prosecuting barrister Paulinus Barnes said she accessed the force's system to obtain information when her former civil partner was allegedly assaulted by her new girlfriend. Stapley also sent her a text saying: 'How dare she lay a finger on you. God help her if I see her.' Breach of trust: A judge at Mold Crown Court jailed Stapley for ten months 'to send out a message' to police staff . The new partner then raised concerns at Wrexham police station and an . investigation showed Stapley had accessed police computer records about . her former partner nine times. On another occasion she gave her then partner a police printout relating to an incident where a work colleague’s daughter had gone missing. And she also used her force issue Blackberry mobile phone to do a background check on the seller of a car for a friend. Her barrister Patrick Cassidy said that his client was a lesbian who was recruited by North Wales Police as part of its equality and diversity policy. Stapley had been recruited in 2008 and there were no problems when she initially worked in Anglesey. But she was posted to her home town of Wrexham, where she had worked for ten years as a taxi driver, and where she was a member of the very close-knit lesbian community, which she knew well, he explained. She suffered from depression, and in 2009 her civil partnership broke down and her mother died. 'She tipped off a friend', Mr Cassidy said. 'There was no payment or any corruption above and beyond the act itself.' When interviewed, she had said that she had acted out of concern and told how she saw herself as an unofficial point of contact for the lesbian community of Wrexham. She said that she would receive calls from unidentified people telling her about incidents that she felt obliged to research.","Lisa Stapley, 39, warned a friend to leave town as police sought her over an assault complaint .

Minutes of two board meetings at the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority show only its chairman, Sir Ian Kennedy, attended, while the remaining executives took part over the phone. The revelation was made by veteran  Lib Dem MP Sir Bob Russell in a  parliamentary question to Commons Leader, Sir George Young. Concerned: Liberal Democrat Sir Bob Russell, left, says while meetings by the watchdog set up to monitor expenses were only attended by Sir Ian Kennedy, right, others who took part over the phone still claimed £400 in expenses . Sir Bob told the Commons: ‘Good  news, since my question last week Ipsa has put the minutes of many of its board meetings on its website. ‘It reveals a lack of attendance by most of the members. ‘Indeed, at the meetings on January 30 and March 8, no board members attended other than the chairman. They participated by telephone, for which one assumes they qualified for £400 per day. ‘Bearing in mind that the meeting on March 8, and I quote, “had been convened in order to consider the outcome of  the consultation on MPs” pension contributions and to approve Ipsa’s corporate plan for 2012/13, do you agree  with me that at the very least we, as  members, should debate what the Ipsa board is up to?’ Sir George Young, Conservative MP for North West Hampshire .

There may be an opportunity to  address the issue of membership when the term of office for some of the existing members runs out and the question  of appointment or reappointment of members arises. ‘I would say to you that your intervention shows the effectiveness of backbench members of this House in business questions of getting results.’ Ipsa was created by the Parliamentary Standards Act 2009 in the wake of  the expenses scandal, in which it was revealed MPs had claimed for items including a duck house and moat-cleaning. Until the scandal was uncovered, MPs were paid more than £60,000 a year and under a self-regulated system were allowed to claim tens of thousands pounds more for the upkeep of their second homes and offices, often without submitting receipts. IPSA is tasked with bringing independent control over MPs’ expenses and operates by regularly publishing details of claims and business costs. The watchdog is also responsible for  setting the level of and paying MPs’ annual salaries; paying the salaries of MPs’ staff, drawing up, reviewing, and administering allowances schemes;  and determining the procedures for investigations and complaints made against politicians.

However, the other woman never showed up, said Patrick Espinoza, a San Diego County prosecutor. 'She sent a text saying, ""Help,""' Espinoza said about Killgore. 'She was missing from that point on.' Perez told investigators he dropped . off Killgore in downtown San Diego's Gaslamp District, but he actually . stayed in Fallbrook, about 60 miles north, authorities said. Jessica Lynn Lopez, 25, has already been charged with the murder after she was found at a San Diego motel room with a . suicide note detailing what happened to Killgore.

In the blog titled 13smyfavoritenumber, Killgore, whose nude body was discovered on Tuesday, wrote about her insecurities and how she suffered from depression, according to NBC San Diego. ‘im so insecure sometimes its not even funny (sic),’ she wrote aged 17, adding that she had recently stopped taking anti-depressants.

She also told how she was worried . about getting married because of the high divorce rates. When responding to a question about . whether she wanted to get married, Killgore wrote in 2007: ‘i want to . be, but … i want to love that person. the divorce rate is so high its . sad.’ In other postings, Killgore revealed . she did not get on with her family and was looking forward to moving out . and going to college. ‘im planning to move out its very . difficult. i dont get along with my family all that well i think it will . be better when i move out. my sister and i have gotten closer though, . its actully realy weird,’ she said .

Mrs Killgore, who was reported missing Saturday -- one day after Lopez . turned 25. 'There's a lot of speculation, a lot of innuendo, a lot of weak allegations and charges out there,' he said. 'I would caution everyone to not jump to conclusions and prejudge based on all the information flying around right now.' Mr . Broyles said Lopez would ask the judge for a public defender after her . family sought his help in fielding media questions. Lopez's parents, who . live in nearby Escondido, released a statement saying they loved their . daughter. 'We pray for the . family of Brittany Killgore and ask that the Lord comfort them during . their time of grief and anguish,' the parents said. 'We ask that you pray for all of those impacted by this tragic situation, including our family.' Authorities have not disclosed Mrs Killgore, Lopez, and Perez are connected.

Companies were yesterday urged to ‘hire a hoodie’ in an attempt to get more young Britons off the dole queue. Employment Minister Chris Grayling called on bosses to give local youths a chance instead of hiring experienced Eastern Europeans. He claimed that despite their lack of experience, ‘surly young men can turn into excited and motivated employees’. 'Hire a hoodie': Employment Minister Chris Grayling (left) today called on firms to hire local youths instead of Eastern Europeans. His comments echoed David Cameron's 2007 'hug a hoodie' remark, which was infamously ridiculed by Manchester teen Ryan Florence (right) The minister spoke on the day figures revealed that unemployment had . fallen slightly across the country. But many of the new jobs are being . taken by migrants. The figures also showed that record numbers of men are being forced to . accept part-time work because they can’t find full-time jobs. Mr Grayling said it was ‘easy’ for companies to hire Eastern Europeans, . who tended to be older and more experienced than many Britons seeking . work. Speaking to the Policy Exchange think-tank in London, he said: ‘But . those who look closer to home can find gems too. Falling: The number of people out of work dropped by 35,000 in the last quarter - yet the number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance actually increased . Often the surly young . man in a hoodie who turns up looking unwilling to work can turn into an . exciting and motivated employee. ‘It’s all about the explanations that they have, and the place they come . from. And employers who give them that chance find it enormously . rewarding. ‘So I stand foursquare behind my hope that British employers will put local recruits first.’ In a wide-ranging speech on employment issues, Mr Grayling - whose . comments echoed David Cameron’s call for people to ‘hug a hoodie’ while . in Opposition - also criticised companies who set up call centres . abroad, calling them ‘mad’. He said: ‘We all know how frustrating it can . be speaking to a call centre operator overseas who works from a set . script, but doesn’t get what your problem is.’ The figures, from the Office for National Statistics, also revealed that . the number of full-time workers actually fell 27,000 to 21.2million, . showing how the unemployment drop is being fuelled by the ballooning . ‘Part-Time Britain’ trend. There were 80,000 more part-time workers between December and February, taking the total to 7.9million. Of those, the ONS figures revealed that 1.4million have only taken . part-time work after failing to get a full-time job - with the most . dramatic increase in this category among men. The army of men working part-time following a fruitless search for . full-time employment has increased to 626,000, the largest number since . records began 20 years ago. It has more than doubled since the credit . crunch struck in 2007, and there are fears it will keep on climbing. John Philpott, of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, . said: ‘For these men, it is a choice between a part-time job and being . unemployed.’ Jobs crisis: There will be almost one million people who are 'long-term unemployed' by the end of the year . Almost a million people will have been out of work for more than a year by the end of 2012, according to new research. The IPPR think tank said another 107,000 people will join the ranks of the long-term unemployed in the coming months, taking the total to its highest level since 1995. The report, said long-term unemployment was the 'hidden crisis' facing the UK economy. Tony Dolphin, the IPPR's chief economist, said: 'Long-term unemployment is the hidden crisis of the slowest ever economic recovery in the UK. 'While the youth contract is designed to help young people out of work for more than a year, the Work Programme has only been able to secure employment for about a third of jobseekers on the programme. 'On current progress, just two-thirds of people out of work for a year will not get work in the following two years. Government policy is not keeping pace with joblessness. 'Unemployment is not going to fall until the middle of 2013 and the number of people out of work for more than a year is going to grow to almost a million the end of this year. The longer someone is unemployed, the less likely they are to ever return to work. 'The government should guarantee everyone who has been unemployed for more than a year a job at the minimum wage in local government or the voluntary sector. But with that right should come the responsibility to take that job or risk losing their benefits.' The reports follow news that almost 500 jobs are under threat after supermarket milk supplier Dairy Crest announced plans to close two dairies. The proposed closures involve a glass bottling dairy at Aintree, where 220 people work, and a site at Fenstanton in Cambridgeshire employing 250 people. The Unite union described it as 'devastating news.' Aquascutum, the 160-year-old British clothing retailer which has dressed Winston Churchill and the Queen Mother, collapsed into administration yesterday, jeopardising 250 jobs. The business was bought by Jaeger's owner Harold Tillman and its chief executive Belinda Earl in 2009 but it continued to make 'significant losses' despite their efforts to turn it around, according to administrators at FRP Advisory.","Employment Minister Chris Grayling said hiring Eastern Europeans over local youths was 'easy' option .

Cold case: Tammy Zywicki, 21, was returning to university in Iowa in 1992 and was found raped and murdered nine days after she went missing, hundreds of miles away . After her car broke down along an Illinois freeway, a Burlington County college student described by her mother as an all-American 'girly girl' was snatched, attacked sexually, and repeatedly stabbed, perhaps by a trucker posing as a good Samaritan. Tammy Zywicki's body eventually turned up in a blanket wrapped with duct tape in southwestern Missouri, hundreds of miles from where she was last seen alive. Two decades later, the killer is unknown. Federal and Illinois investigators hope a $50,000 reward changes that. On Wednesday, the eve of the 20th anniversary of Zywicki's disappearance, the head of the Illinois State Police said investigators had not forgotten the case. 'This investigation remains a top priority, both for me personally as well as the men and women' of the agency, Director Hiram Grau said, adding that authorities 'are committed to bringing justice and peace to the Zywicki family.' Robert Grant, head of the FBI's Chicago office, touted the reward from a source authorities have not disclosed. 'We remain confident that someone knows who committed this heinous act and will have the courage to help us identify this individual,' Grant said. Last seen: The student was last seen standing on the side of the road by her broken-down car near mile marker 83 on I-80 in central Illinois . On August 23, 1992, Zywicki had dropped off her younger brother at Northwestern University and turned her 1985 Pontiac T1000 toward Iowa's Grinnell College, where she played soccer and would have been a senior. The 21-year-old, whose family had moved to Marlton from South Carolina less than six months before, was considering graduate school and aspiring perhaps to teach Spanish. After her car broke down on I-80 near LaSalle, a passer-by caught the last glimpse of her alive at Mile Marker 83. Some witnesses said a tractor-trailer was parked behind her car. Others said they saw a pickup truck. Zywicki's body turned up nine days later just east of Joplin, Missori. Not forgotten: On August 22, the eve of the 20th anniversary of Zywicki's disappearance, the head of Illinois State Police insisted investigators haven't forgotten the case and offered a $50,000 reward . Mother's memories: Tammy's mother JoAnn Zywicki, pictured, sits by a photo of her daughter Tammy at her home in Ocala, Florida . The 5-foot-2-inch, 120-pound woman, who wrote in a high school journal that she did not want to suffer when she died, had been stabbed repeatedly in the chest. A task force headed by the FBI and Illinois State Police spent months chasing hundreds of leads 'without success' before disbanding, Wednesday's statement from the agencies said. Investigators looked at truckers suspected in killings and sexual attacks from North Carolina to California, but eliminated them from suspicion. Going years without knowing who killed Tammy has tormented JoAnn Zywicki, now of Ocala, Florida. She and her now-retired husband have endured the birthdays, holidays, and other special occasions they no longer get to share with their daughter, and 'you just go into a pattern of maybe acceptance, that that's the way it is,' she said last month. On Wednesday, JoAnn Zywicki welcomed word that investigators still were pursuing the case.'Something's better than nothing,' said Zywicki, 70. 'I'm confident that something could come out of this. 'Twenty years has been a lot harder than I thought it would be. We just have too many memories with her not around. It would just be nice to get some kind of closure.'","Tammy Zywicki, 21, was driving along Illinois freeway in 1992 when car broke down .

Numbers of a British seabird have fallen so low that experts fear the breed could soon become the first victim of climate change. One breeding colony of the Kittiwake in Scotland is now extinct and others are predicted to disappear within three years, according to wildlife experts. The sea bird, one of the most abundant in the world, is disappearing at an 'alarming' rate, the Royal Protection for the Society of Birds (RSPB) said. End of the road? Experts say the Kittiwake sea bird could face extinction in Scotland within three years . Conservationists say the decline is down to alterations to the marine environment brought on by climate change, with the North Sea's food chain being 'profoundly affected'. The population of Kittiwake has more than halved in the UK since the mid-1980s and the breeding numbers in Scotland have declined by almost two-thirds. The far north of Scotland has seen some of the steepest declines, particularly in Shetland and Orkney where about one fifth of the UK Kittiwake population return to breed each year. However, in just over a decade, experts have recorded a massive 82 per cent decline in breeding pairs at Orkney's 'seabird cities'. Counts undertaken by the RSPB and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) also revealed populations on the Orkney mainland fell from nearly 11,000 pairs in 2000 to under 2,000 this year. Kittiwakes failed to return to the 'once-bursting' cliff colony of Orkney's Mull Head this year - and cliffs at Costa Head Birsay held less than 200 breeding pars. Some of the steepest declines have been in the far north of Scotland, particularly in Orkney (pictured) Three other colonies are 'hanging on by a thread; with fewer than 90 nests each - indicating potential local extinction within the next three years. Doug . Gilbert, RSPB Scotland Head of Reserves Ecology, said: 'The counts this . year are deeply shocking, especially the loss of kittiwakes at Mull . Head. We know that kittiwakes in other parts of Orkney are equally . affected, and to think of Orkney without thriving colonies of these . fantastic birds is a sad prospect. The Kittiwake is a medium-sized gull with a small yellow bill and a dark eye, a grey back but with a white underside . It feeds on fish, shrimps and worms. In flight, its black-tipped wings look as though they are 'dipped in ink' In the breeding season, this coastal gull can be found in seabird colonies around the UK . In late summer and autumn it can be . seen flying past offshore, or collecting at roosts, while it spends the . winter months out at sea . The best time to see them is on breeding grounds in spring and summer . Source: RSPB . 'It . now appears undeniable that the declines in kittiwake and other . seabirds are being driven by changes in the marine environment related . to climate change. The food chain of the North Sea is being profoundly . affected, and seabirds, at the top of the chain, are suffering. 'Everyone with an interest in our seas and their health should be paying attention to this. 'Seabirds . remain largely unprotected at sea and have been marginalised in the . identification of new Marine Protected Areas- this obvious gap needs to . be filled if Scotland is going to prove it is serious about protecting . threatened wildlife.' Most of the breeding kittiwakes - 1,134 pairs - were found at RSPB Scotland's Marwick Head nature reserve, but these numbers were 75 per cent lower than in 1999, when 5,400 pairs were nesting. The Sumburgh Head nature reserve in Shetland also reported a poor year, with only a few chicks hatching. However, a kittiwake colony at Troup Head on the Moray Firth experienced its best season in years with more than 500 chicks fledging. Meanwhile, a colony in Aberdeenshire which had been described as being in 'freefall' has seen a halt in the long-term decline of Kittiwake numbers. Experts have been encouraged by the number of chicks in recent years. The RSPB said a fuller picture of this year's seabird breeding season will be available in the autumn.","Scotland's 'seabird cities' in Orkney see a 'staggering' 82 per cent decline in breeding pairs over last decade .

"By . Sophie Borland . UPDATED: . 05:54 EST, 18 July 2011 . Obesity, heavy drinking and a ‘couch potato’ lifestyle are fuelling soaring rates of cancer in the middle-aged, a report warns today. The numbers in their forties and fifties diagnosed with the illness has risen by a fifth in the last 30 years. The warnings followed claims that cancer survival rates are actually improving, and have even doubled over the past 40 years. Experts say that certain tumours once only considered common in old-age are now widespread in younger generations . Improved treatment, national screening programmes, better testing and drugs mean more cancers are being detected at an earlier age. According to a Cancer Research UK study, the chances of surviving cancer for at least 10 years have doubled to almost 50 per cent. Experts say that certain tumours once only considered common in old-age are now widespread in younger generations. Some 61,000 Britons aged 40 to 59 are diagnosed with cancer every year, according to figures. Rates of prostate cancer in middle-aged men have risen sixfold in the last 30 years and there are nearly 4,000 new cases in this group a year. It is the most common form of cancer in males and the average man has a one in nine chance of being affected at some stage in his life. Breast cancer rates in women in their forties and fifties have risen by 60 per cent in the same period and there are some 17,110 cases a year. Figures show that one in eight women will develop the disease at some stage in life. Other cancers affecting the bowel, stomach, kidney, throat and mouth have also become more common in the middle-aged and many are associated with obesity, lack of exercise and alcohol. The map shows the number of all Cancer cases as a rate per 100,000 of the population . The only form of the disease which has significantly declined in the last 30 years is lung cancer, due to fewer numbers smoking. Only last week separate figures showed that four in ten Britons – 42 per cent – would be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lives, up from 33 per cent a decade ago. The alarming report by Macmillan Cancer Support warned that the NHS would struggle to cope with the increasing numbers of cases – many caused by unhealthy lifestyles. Researchers have shown that fat tissue in the overweight and obese produces hormones such as insulin and oestrogen which can trigger the growth of tumours. Alcohol is believed to have a similar effect and other lifestyle factors such as lack of exercise and a diet rich in red meat have been linked to cancer. Experts are urging adults in their forties and fifties to play closer attention to possible symptoms to ensure the illness is diagnosed as early as possible. Sara Hiom, Cancer Research UK’s director of health information, said: ‘We know we can lessen our cancer risk by not smoking, cutting down on alcohol, keeping a healthy weight, taking exercise and eating a balanced diet. But all too often the unhealthy choice, like taking the lift instead of the stairs, is the easiest option. ‘We also know acting on signs and symptoms quickly, going for screening when invited and being diagnosed and treated promptly can make all the difference in long-term survival.’ The charity also points out that the increase in rates of breast and prostate cancer is partly due to better screening. And thanks to earlier diagnosis and better treatments the survival rates of cancer have doubled since the 1970s. But campaigners warn the NHS has a ‘massive challenge ahead’, due to the soaring numbers of cases. Mike Hobday, head of policy at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ‘It is really alarming that cancer rates in middle-aged men and women have increased this rapidly in a generation. ‘The NHS needs to recognise that cancer is now a long-term condition and plan better services to help  people manage the long-term effects of the disease.’","Some 61,000 Britons aged 40 to 59 are diagnosed with cancer every year ."

However, it seems that relying on her usual mode of transport by flying to her destination of New York, Lindsay had opted to travel by broomstick - judging by the witchy, all-black outfit the actress wore. Lindsay looked incredibly gothic in a floppy hat, leggings and vest beneath a sheer . blouse as she touched down in New York with her brother Cody. The actress' trip comes after she was questioned by police on Monday over jewellery which was reported missing at a multi-million dollar residence Lindsay had partied in over the weekend.

According to the website, the owner of the home, who has not been named, invited the actress to the all-night house party. But a close friend has spoken out in defence of star, claiming the trip was not rushed but had been planned for weeks. Business associate Claus Hjelmbak told RadarOnline: 'The trip to New York City had been planned for a while and she will be having several work meetings and spending time with her family. 'There was no escaping anything. I had dinner with Lindsay, Dina and her brother Cody, on Monday night at the Viceroy Hotel and she is doing remarkably well and focused on work.'

Probe: Police questioned Lindsay and several guests at the scene of the Hollywood Hills home . According to the website, the home is owned by a man described as 'a player on the Hollywood social scene' who 'likes to have famous friends'. The case remains under investigation. However, this is not the first time Lindsay has been linked to jewellery theft. Lindsay reportedly told law enforcement officers that she had nothing to do with the missing gems. Mugshot: Lindsay posed for a mugshot in January 2011 after her arrest for shoplifting . The actress was famously charged with shoplifting a necklace from a Venice Beach jewellery store in February last year. She was charged with misdemenour theft and probation violation, and was sentenced to 120 days in jail and 480 hours of community service. In addition, she was also ordered to remain under supervision whilst completing all of her community service. The actress pleaded no contest in court, and was put under house arrest complete with ankle bracelet monitor  due to jail overcrowding. Lindsay . was then later sentenced to 30 days in jail and 400 hours of community . service in November, after she was found guilty of violating her . probation because she failed to perform her community service at a Los . Angeles morgue. She entered jail on November 7, 2011, but was released after just under five hours, again due to overcrowding. The actress finally ended her . supervised probation in March this year after fulfilling all of her . community service and therapy requirements. And despite being involved in a hit and run and car crash earlier this year,  has remained relatively out of trouble. She is currently trying to get her life and career back on track, and recently completed filming Liz & Dick, the Lifetime Elizabeth Taylor biopic, and independent film, The Canyons, written by Bret Easton Ellis and directed by Paul Schrader.","Friends speak out in defence of star saying she is focused on work .

They couldn't be there because they had another young child to care for and the father had used up his leave during the final weeks of the complicated pregnancy. So instead, Brandi and Charles Ray Harrington of Bentonville, Arkansas, used the device to further a bonding process that doctors say is crucial. The importance of feeling close to babies — for the babies as well as their parents — has transformed newborn intensive care units around the country. Instead of brief visiting hours, for instance, many allow parents 24-hour access. Keeping watch: A webcam feed on an iPad of four-month-old Emily St. Martin in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Ochsner Medical Center, at her family's home in LaPlace, Louisiana . The next step in the process involves webcam technology that has had applications ranging from peering into eagles' nests to linking soldiers in war zones with their loved ones back home. Now parents, grandparents and friends can log in to babycams in hospitals around the U.S. and several countries. At least eight domestic hospitals have installed such systems, and several dozen others are testing trial setups. Brandi Harrington said nurses at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences hospital often put notes on camera. She read from some that were captured in screenshots: ‘I'm now 4 (pounds) 1 oz. Woohoo!’ ‘Be back soon. Pooping on my own. Gonna try to breathe on my own too. Taking the breathing tube out.’ The . UAMS Medical Center in Little Rock was among the first to install . webcams in neonatal intensive care units back in 2006, and it had to . create its own system. Now, the chairman of the hospital's OB-GYN . department has passed on his software to a Pennsylvania hospital, while . at least two companies are selling contracts for similar systems. Bonding time: Laura and David St. Martin, with their daughter Jacqueline, age two, watch their fourth-month-old daughter Emily who was born in April at 24 weeks . At UAMS and Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, a speaker inside each incubator lets parents coo, talk and sing to their babies. That's not available through the 53 cameras recently installed at Ochsner Health System near New Orleans by Healthcare Observation Systems LLC of Louisville, Kentucky. Company owner Blake Rutherford says about 200 of the 600-plus NICUs caring for critically ill newborns have asked for information; he has installed six systems and has trial setups at about 40 other hospitals. The systems aren't used by doctors and nurses for clinical care in the U.S. The system made by Rutherford's company doesn't store any video. People watching a baby can take screenshot ‘photographs,’ but the video is gone as soon as it's transmitted, Rutherford said. Parents use the U.S. systems for free, . and they typically get a password — which they can share with family . and friends — to log in to a secure server to watch their baby. Developers . of the systems say they could be adapted for use with different types . of patients. For example, Rutherford said he's been asked about setting . up webcams for nursing home residents but hasn't begun developing such a . system. Babycams: At least eight U.S. hospitals have installed webcam systems in newborn ICUs, and several dozen others are testing trial setups . Laura and David St. Martin can see little Emily Jane in person every day, even though their home in LaPlace, Louisiana, is only about a half-hour drive from Ochsner. She was born April 14 at 24 weeks, weighing 1lb, 3 ounces. Still, they check on her regularly, sometimes at night. It can offer a huge sense of relief, said David St. Martin: ‘If you wake up at 2 in the morning you're able to pull her up on the camera and see she's all right.’ Sometimes nurses alert the St. Martins to events, such as when they took Emily Jane off a ventilator and substituted a nasal tube to an oxygen tank. ‘Right after they did that, Susie, her main nurse, called and said, “You need to look at the camera,”’ Laura St. Martin recalled. ‘I was at work. I looked at the camera and said, “Oh, my god!”’ Doctors at the hospital in Little Rock say webcam monitoring of newborns in intensive care is more than a feel-good gimmick in an age of instant communication. Rather, they hope to reduce a number of problems that can occur when the babies go home by increasing bonding with parents. Remote access: Parents can log in to a secure server to watch their baby in the hospital . Premature babies are more likely to be irritable or have physical or emotional problems, said Dr Curtis Lowery, chairman of the OB-GYN department at UAMS. In turn, the tiny babies are more likely to be shaken or beaten — which doctors think can be avoided through greater bonding. ‘If their parents haven't bonded with them, they'll have problems, Lowery said. A pilot study will compare bonding among parents who use the system frequently and those who use it less often. Another will see whether babies show a physical response, such as changed heart or breathing rates, to hearing their parents. Cameras are built into 21 of the hospital's 64 incubators. The sickest babies usually get the cameras, said nurse Sarah Rhoads, who also runs a telemedicine program for women who live in remote parts of the state and are undergoing high-risk pregnancies. Important service: The sickest babies usually get the cameras over their cribs, allowing parents to keep track of their recovery from home . ‘They tend to put them on babies that are going to be here a longer period of time,’ she said. Lowery said the hospital pays about $9,000 per camera. ‘With a prototype you need to overbuild,’ he said. ‘Now we're talking about a more basic version that could be sold for a couple-thousand or less.’ ‘A lot of it's about bonding and keeping families together, largely. If you live three hours away, four hours away, and your baby's going to be here four months it's hard to do that economically,’ he said. ‘This is not the same as being there but it's more like being there than talking to the nurse that's seeing and watching the baby.’","At least eight U.S. hospitals have newborn webcam systems in place .

Beer is the alcohol of choice for American drinkers, according to a new poll (file photo) Beer is a firm fixture in many of America's favourite pastimes; from enjoying a cold one at a barbecue to relaxing with a bottle in front of the baseball. Now a new poll has confirmed that beer is the alcohol of choice for most Americans - and that two thirds of people are indulging in four alcoholic drinks every week. A total of 66 per cent of people surveyed admitted consuming an average of 4.2 drinks a week. The annual survey by Gallup indicated that drinking levels among Americans are remaining steady, with last year's poll indicating that 64 per cent of people in the U.S. drank an average of 4.1 alcoholic beverages per week. Beer was revealed to be the most popular beverage, with 39 per cent of drinkers indicating that was what they drank most often. Wine was the drink of choice for 35 per cent of people surveyed, while 22 per cent favoured liquor. Beer was the most popular alcoholic drink among 18 to 34-year-olds and those aged between 35 and 54. Drinkers aged 55 and above lean more towards wine, the survey showed. Drinking habits: Beer proved especially popular among drinkers in the Midwest, with wine first choice for those on the east coast . It also indicated that people in the Midwest showed the greatest preference for beer, while wine was more popular with drinkers in the east of the country. The number of drinkers who said they indulged too often was up to 22 per cent from 17 per cent last year. According to the findings 12 per cent of people polled reported having eight or more drinks in the week leading up to Gallup's annual consumption habits survey. The survey polled over 1,000 adults in all 50 states. 'Drinking is commonplace in the U.S,' the report said. 'Drinkers still show a slight preference for beer, but wine is not far behind.

Transplant surgeons have carried out a record-breaking live liver transplant operation to save a young man on the verge of death. Billy Sewell, 24, had just hours to live when surgeons got the go-ahead to transplant a slice of liver from his best friend. Normally such operations take weeks of planning. But in just 48 hours, Luke Gumble underwent a range of medical tests and a battery of psychological interviews to allow him to donate. Close: Billy Sewell (right) had just hours to live when surgeons got the go-ahead to transplant a slice of liver from his best friend Luke Gumball (left) It is believed to be the first time a live liver transplant has been approved so quickly. A team of doctors, scientists, transplant co-ordinators and medical ethicists at London’s Royal Free Hospital worked at break-neck speed to make it possible for Mr Gumble to give a chunk of his liver. Mr Sewell did not have time on his side - he was literally on the edge of death when liver surgeons decided that his closest friend, also 24, was his only hope of survival. Professor Max Malago, who carried out the transplant, said: 'I can’t recall a live case where we’ve operated so quickly. 'This was a patient needing a live transplant so urgently that we had no more than a couple of days to go through loads of tests and paper work. 'Even though there was extreme urgency everything had to be done by the book.' One minute Mr Sewell, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, was relatively well. The next, doctors at the Royal Free Hospital were giving him just days to live. He said: 'I had been diagnosed with liver failure for a few months and the doctors were talking of a transplant with a dead donor liver some time in the future. 'But then I became very ill over the period of just a few days. In the end I was hanging on to life with my liver completely shot through.' Race against time: The best friends pose with the team of doctors, scientists, transplant co-ordinators and medical ethicists from London's Royal Free Hospital . Nobody knows why Mr Sewell, who was fit and healthy, developed liver failure or why he suddenly became critically ill. Friends and family offered to donate at short notice - just a week before the transplant. But all were found to be unsuitable. Professor Malago said: 'Patients who are stable with liver disease can suddenly drop over the edge. 'We were faced with a situation where we needed someone close to give Billy a liver at very short notice. We weren’t going to find a dead donor. 'It’s not the way we normally work with live donors It was an unusual situation and we had to respond by working very quickly. It was a fantastic team effort. 'Even though a life is in the balance we cannot cut corners. There are a lot of processes to be gone through when someone gives a slice of their liver as a donor. 'But somehow we managed to get it all done between a Friday night and a Monday morning. 'All the time we were conscious that with every hour that passed we might lose Billy. He was that ill he could have gone at any time.' Grateful: Mr Gumble and Mr Sewell with Professor Max Malago (right), who carried out the transplant . When everyone had been tested, the only satisfactory match for Mr Sewell was his childhood friend Mr Gumble, also from Stevenage. He said: 'Billy’s sister was the nearest after me but she didn’t quite match up. So it was down to me. 'I had made my mind up anyway but there wasn’t much time to think about it. 'I would do anything for Billy but I never thought I’d be the only match for a transplant ahead of his family. It was a shock when they told me.' The transplant took place in mid-February and both men are now fighting fit and happily sporting their fading scars. The liver is the only organ in the body capable of regeneration, and in just three months Mr Gumble’s liver has re-grown. Live donors almost always come from a family member and are normally from adult to child. Mr Sewell said: 'I will never forget what Luke has done. We are now even closer than ever. 'I was really on my way out. I discovered just how near I had been to death after I came round. 'The doctors said my old liver was virtually lifeless. I was running on empty when Luke came to my rescue. I had run out of time. He was my only hope.'","Billy Sewell, 24, had just hours to live when surgeons got the go-ahead to transplant a slice of liver from his best friend .

Jerry Sandusky's former daughter-in-law has obtained a legal order barring the ex-Penn State coach from seeing three of his grandchildren. Jill Jones, who was once married to Matt Sandusky, went to court to stop the accused paedophile from having access to their two daughters, aged nine and seven, and one son, aged five, according to documents. A Grand Jury indictment alleges Sandusky, 67, sexually abused eight boys, some as young as seven, over a 15-year period. He denies the allegations. After hearing the horrific charges on November 5, Ms Jones urged her ex-husband to keep the children away from their grandfather, The Daily reported. Scroll down for video . Cuffed: Former Penn State football defensive coordinator Gerald 'Jerry' Sandusky, centre, arriving in handcuffs at the office of Centre County Magisterial District Judge Leslie A. Dutchcot on November 5 . No go area: Jill Jones, the ex-wife of Sandusky's adopted son Matt, has an order which prohibits her two daughters and one son from sleeping over at their grandparents' home, pictured . Grandmother: Dorothy Sandusky, wife of the shamed ex Penn State coach, reportedly called Ms Jones trying to convince her the children would be safe . Later that day Sandusky's wife Dorothy sent Ms Jones a text message informing her that Matt had taken the children to her State College, Pennsylvania home, but that Sandusky was not present. Mrs Sandusky also phoned Ms Jones to try to persuade her that the children would be safe around her husband, the documents said, according to The Daily. Ms Jones was unwavering, though, and successfully obtained a restraining order forbidding the children from sleeping over at their grandparents' home and banning Sandusky from seeing them unsupervised. Although there is no record that Ms Jones ever accused her ex-father-in-law of abusing her children, there is a 'fundamental disagreement over the validity of the charges against Jerry Sandusky and the risk he poses to children,' the court documents said, according to The Daily. Sandusky's attorney, Joe Amendola says his client rejects all the allegations set forth in the 23-page indictment. The news came as it emerged that Matt, one of six now adult children Sandusky and his wife adopted during the course of the lengthy marriage, attempted suicide just four months after first going to live with the couple. Matt, now 33, came into the Sandusky home through The Second Mile in 1995, after having a troubled childhood in which he had burnt down a barn. Children and Youth Services placed him with the family at Sandusky's request. The probation officer, Terry Trude, became concerned about Matt's well-being and mental health and together with his biological mother Debra Long, wrote a letter to Centre County Judge David Grine asking for his living situation to be reviewed, the Patriot-News reported. However contemporary court records include a letter written by Matt in which he implores the judge to allow him to stay with the family. 'I would like to be placed back with the Sanduskys. I feel that they have supported me even when I have messed up. They are a loving caring group of people. I love both my biological family and the Sandusky family,' he wrote at the time. Matt is not one of the eight victims in the Grand Jury indictment, but he did testify before the investigative panel at the attorney general’s office in the Strawberry Square complex, Harrisburg,  the Patriot-News reported. Sinister signage: The Second Mile charity, headquarters in State College, Pennsylvania pictured, was where Sandusky allegedly picked his victims .

Ms Long said she also testified to the Grand Jury panel, and told them of her son’s change in behaviour after he went to live with Sandusky, according to the Patriot-News. Mr Amendola countered, saying Long 'never liked Jerry because she saw Jerry as a person who was involved in removing her child from the home.' Two of Matt’s adopted siblings followed their father into the world of football: Edward Joel, 41, a former Nittany Lions player, and now a football coach at West Chester University and Jon, who is Director of Player Personnel for the Cleveland Browns. On Monday, Jon went on a leave of absence from the NFL club as the scandal involving his father exploded into the public domain. He and his wife, Kia, have an infant son. Over the years the Sanduskys also became the parents to Ray, now 46, a photographer and woodturner living in Brentwood, Tennesee, Kara, 38, a Penn State graduate, and Jeff, 35, a former Marine. In Sandusky's 2000 memoir titled 'Touched', Kara, named Sandusky Werner, wrote in the introduction: 'We were always proud of the things he did for kids.' On his website, Ray writes: 'I have always been creative and constructive. I can recall painting meaningful images as a child in kindergarten, throwing clay vessels on a wheel in junior high school and performing all manner of assembly and repairs around the house.' This week has seen people who believed they knew Sandusky come forward to express their shock at the allegations. 'A lot of people look at him as a monster now,' Kip Richeal, who co-authored Touched, told ESPN. 'I would've never, ever thought something like this about him. And how long did it go on? It never happened with me. When I met him, though, I was 18. I wasn't a little boy. 'If this is all true, and it looks like it's really stacking up, something took over his personality. Something changed, and it's not the Jerry I know.' Meanwhile ex-NFL player Jon Ritchie, who knew Sandusky since he was a 14-year-old, said on ESPN: 'I thought he was the most compassionate, altruistic, selfless man on the face of the planet. 'There were always kids around, Second Mile kids (the charity Sandusky set up and allegedly picked his victims from). 'And these tragedies that are coming out now have brought sports, have brought everyone, to the darkest place. I can’t fathom sports right now. I don’t even care about sports right now. Because this picture of what I thought was good has exploded.'","Jill Jones, ex-wife of Matt Sandusky, went to court after hearing charges .

Stephanie Still, 21, has made remarkable progress, after undergoing a gruelling 10-hour operation and is now planning to dance at a charity fundraising event. Ms Still reached the semi-finals of Sky’s Got To Dance with her dance group Tap Attack last February. But she was diagnosed with a rare malignant brain tumour last May. A grade three ependymoma, it measured four and a half centimetres across and was removed in a 10 and a half hour operation days later. Ms Still, a dance and theatre performance student at Bird College in Sidcup, Kent, said: 'It was very big. 'They needed to get it out as soon as they could. If they didn’t, it would not have been long before it did something drastic.' Captain of the England team that finished second at the World Tap Championships in 2010, she said: . 'I was told I would probably never be able to dance again. That was like the end of my life.' Ms Still was diagnosed after suffering shooting pains in her neck and back for more than a year, which was dismissed by doctors as muscular and the result of strenuous dance routines. She said: 'It was uncomfortable, but the pain went so I carried on. But then it started to get so bad it made me cry, and I don’t cry easily.

Jennifer Hudson wept today as she testified at the trial of the man accused of killing her mother, brother and seven-year-old nephew in a jealous rage four years ago. Hudson was the first witness called after prosecutors and attorneys for William Balfour finished their opening statements. The singer and Oscar-winning actress wore a subdued black dress, minimal make-up and had her hair wrapped in a bun as she took the stand after emerging from a judge's chamber. Celebrity witness: Court sketch of Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson, who was questioned for more than 30 minutes on the first day of her brother-in-law's murder trial in Chicago . She said: 'My name is Jennifer Kate Hudson. I’m an actress and a singer', according to the Chicago Sun-Times. She responded to prosecutors' questions softly but confidently and when asked to identify the defendant, pointed at Balfour. 'He's sitting right there,' she said. Hudson told the court that she had known Balfour since middle school but had never liked him. Balfour looked at Hudson but otherwise showed little emotion during her testimony. Hudson began to cry when she spoke about her seven-year-old nephew Julian. Emotional: Jennifer Hudson wept on the witness stand today when she spoke about the murders of her mother, brother and nephew . 'It was always me and my Tugga Bear. That's what I called him,' she said of her nephew, according to the Chicago Tribune. Hudson was tearful as she started to . describe her reaction when her sister, Julia Hudson, told her she was . going to marry Balfour. 'None of us wanted her to marry him,' she said, her voice cracking and struggling to hold back tears. 'None of us - myself, my mother, or my brother  - we did not like how he treated her, and I didn’t like how he treated my nephew. 'I would tell her (Julia) over and over again not to marry William.' Hudson testified about the harrowing day she learned of the deaths, flying home to Chicago on October 24, 2008, and identifying her mother and brother's bodies at the morgue. Three days later she was back at the morgue to identify her nephew's body. The testimony became increasingly difficult for the star when talking about seeing her family the Sunday before the killings and later when a prosecutor showed her a picture of her mother. She identified a photo of her mother, saying: 'That’s my mommy.' After more than 30 minutes on the stand, Hudson walked slowly across the courtroom directly in front of jurors clutching tissues. She then took a seat in the fourth row next to her fiance David Otunga. Troubled relationship: Jennifer Hudson's sister Julia with her estranged husband William Balfour who is standing trial for murdering her relatives . 'Tugga bear': Jennifer Hudson offered $100,000 for the safe return of her nephew Julian King, seven (left) William Balfour is charged with three . counts of first-degree murder over the October 24, 2008 slayings that . generated nationwide headlines because of Hudson's fame. A former federal prosecutor said prosecutors were shrewd to call Jennifer Hudson as their first witness. 'It . rivets the jury,' said Phil Turner, a Chicago attorney. 'For better or . worse it increases the importance of the case in jurors' minds.' Turner . noted Hudson now can sit through the rest of the trial, in full view of . the jury. Witnesses typically are not allowed to watch trials until . they have testified. Julia . Hudson testified Monday afternoon, confirming that her family . disapproved of her relationship with Balfour. Jennifer Hudson, clutching . a plastic bag of tissues, watched from a fourth row bench. Support: Friends and family of William Balfour walk inside of the Cook County Criminal Courts building for his trial today . Julia Hudson testified that Balfour was so prone to jealousy, he even became angry when Julian kissed her. 'He'd say, ''Get off my wife,''' she said. She choked up while describing the first of many alleged threats by Balfour. After she rejected his pleas in May 2008 to reconcile, she said Balfour grew agitated. 'He said, ''If you leave me, you will . be the last to die. l'll kill your family first,""' she said, her voice . quivering. Traumatic: Friends and supporters of Jennifer Hudson leave court after the opening day of the trial of William Balfour which is expected to last four weeks . She said he used precisely the same words at least several . other times in the months before the triple homicide. Prosecutors have said that Balfour believed balloons he saw at the Hudson home came . from Julia Hudson's new boyfriend. Driving away for her job as a school . bus driver on October 24, 2008, Julia said she glimpsed Balfour in her mirror still lingering outside. It is alleged that Balfour went back inside the . three-story house around 9am and used a .45-caliber handgun to kill . Hudson's mother, 57-year-old Darnell Hudson Donerson, in the living room . - then shot her 29-year-old brother, Jason Hudson, twice in the head as . he lay in bed.

Hudson's SUV with Julia Hudson's son, Julian King, inside. Authorities . say he shot the boy, nicknamed Juice Box, in the head as he lay behind a . front seat. His body was found in the abandoned vehicle miles away after . a three-day search. There are no known witnesses to the . slayings, and it's unclear what physical evidence exists, be it . fingerprints or DNA. Prosecutors say gunshot residue was found on the . steering wheel of Balfour's car. But the defense says that and other . evidence is circumstantial. A gun, which Balfour allegedly stole . months before from Hudson's brother, was recovered in a lot near where . the SUV was found and will be presented as the murder weapon. Establishing motive may pose less of a challenge. Evidence: Documents for the case of William Balfour, who is accused of killing three members of actress and singer Jennifer Hudson's family are wheeled into court . A high-school dropout and one-time . Gangster Disciple known by the gang name 'Flex', Balfour allegedly . threatened to kill the Hudson family at least two dozen times, starting . earlier in 2008 when he moved out of the house, lead prosecutor James . McKay has said. Court records indicate the now 34-year-old Julia Hudson's divorce from Balfour was finalized last year. If convicted of at least two of the murder counts, the 30-year-old Balfour, on parole at the time of the killings after serving nearly seven years for attempted murder and vehicular hijacking, would face a mandatory life sentence. Jennifer Hudson's name was among 300 on a . list of potential witnesses. The 2004 American Idol finalist and 2007 . Oscar winner for her role in Dreamgirls was expected to attend each day . of testimony, which could last up to a month.

Tragic: Jennifer Hudson holding her Oscar with her mother other Darnell Hudson Donerson, 57, who was found dead at the family's home in Chicago in 2008 . Judge Charles Burns has instructed jurors to set aside any sympathy for Hudson and decide a verdict strictly according to testimony. The panelists include a teacher, a trucker and two people who have had close relatives murdered. Prosecutors have said Balfour claimed he wasn't near the Hudson home at the time of the killing, but they are expected to introduce cellphone records that allegedly prove he was in the area when two teenage girls who live nearby heard gunshots. The witnesses didn't immediately report the shots to police because the sound of gunfire isn't uncommon in the impoverished, crime-ridden Englewood neighbourhood, according to court filings. At a time when cities across the country have seen the number of homicides fall, sometimes dramatically, Chicago's jumped by 60 per cent the first three months of the year, and Englewood's violence was a big reason why. Since he took office last May, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has used the word 'Englewood' as almost shorthand for gangs, guns and the dangers facing the city's children. The deteriorating neighborhood has presented him with one of his biggest challenges, becoming a focus for his promise to deploy more police officers to the street while cracking down on Englewood's gangs. Violence: The boarded up former home of Jennifer Hudson and her family in Englewood, Chicago. There are thousands of boarded-up buildings in the city's most notorious neighbourhood . There are a host of reasons for Englewood's downward spiral. But they mostly boil down to an exodus of families from an area that was predominantly single-family homes, resulting in an explosion in the number of abandoned buildings, and an influx of gang members. Home to 100,000 residents in 1960, Englewood's population has dwindled. It had dropped to about 40,000 in 2000 and to 30,000 just 10 years later. Part of the reason is that families moved out to safer places and others lost their homes when they lost jobs during the recession. According to the police department, there are more than 4,100 abandoned buildings in Englewood, nearly 600 of them vacated in just the last 15 months.","Oscar winning actress was first witness in court today .

An Army doctor has been accused of helping to conceal the death of an Iraqi detainee who suffered 93 injuries and died following an attack by British soldiers in 2003. Dr Derek Keilloh today faced a General Medical Council hearing for his part in helping to cover-up the death of Iraqi hotel receptionist Baha Mousa. The a father-of-two was seen by Dr Keilloh following his arrest by soldiers from the 1st battalion, Queen's  Lancashire Regiment (QLR), in a swoop for insurgents around Basra during the Iraq war eight years ago. Incident: Dr Derek Keilloh, left, is facing a General Medical Hearing . accused of helping to conceal the injuries inflicted on Baha Mousa, . right, in Iraq in 2003 . The doctor reported seeing 'dried blood' around the nose of the 26-year-old who had been hooded, handcuffed and badly beaten after being pulled into the Army detention centre in . the southern Iraqi city. His body was swollen and bruised and his injuries included fractured ribs and a broken nose. Accused: Army medic Dr Derek Keilloh pictured leaving the Medicl Practicioners Tribunal Service in Manchester today. He is facing allegations of helping to cover up the mistreatment of an Iraqi detainee . Dr Keilloh, who at the time was a Captain and Regimental Medical Officer for the QLR, supervised a failed resuscitation attempt of the shirtless Mr Mousa in a desperate bid to save the his life. But the doctor has always maintained he did not see the victim’s catalogue of injuries and therefore did not consciously attempt to conceal anything. Dr Keilloh is appearing before the . Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service, a new arm of the GMC that deals . with allegations of misconduct against doctors. The British Army medic denies dishonesty and misconduct in his treatment of Mr Mousa and other detainees. Rebecca Poulet QC, counsel for the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) opening the case, said Dr Keilloh failed to examine Mousa, then did not check the condition of other detainees or notify senior officers about the mistreatment. Instead, she said, four times 'under oath' Dr Keilloh maintained he did not see the injuries to Mousa’s battered body following mistreatment while in the custody of QLR soldiers. Mrs Poulet said: 'The events span just about three days, but the doctor’s subsequent and more recent conduct is also criticised for his repeated failure to describe this incident with the openness and honesty that is expected of a doctor.' The tribunal heard Dr Keilloh was just 28 at the time of the incident and new to his post, having been in the job only eight weeks. After a 'very short' handover, he took over the medical team of the QLR at their HQ in the former headquarters of the Saddam Hussein’s Ba’ath Party in Basra City. Operation Salerno was launched by the QLR against Saddam Hussein loyalists in the city and on September 14, 2003 Mousa and other detainees were brought in for questioning. It was common practice, the tribunal heard, for detainees to be handcuffed with plastic cable cuffs and hooded with a sandbag. It was also told that prisoners, including Mousa, were checked at the time and none reported injuries or illness before detention. Mrs Poulet said: 'He was to die the following day as a result of the injuries inflicted on him by the soldiers guarding him and a final violent incident on the night of September 15.'","Doctor reported seeing dried blood around the nose of Iraqi victim .

The police officer who shot an unarmed teenager in his bathroom was expected to hand himself in to face manslaughter charges tomorrow. Ramarley Graham, 18, was shot dead on February 2 after the NYPD followed him to his home and kicked down the door. Officer Richard Haste, 30, who has been a policeman for four years, is expected to be indicted on first- and second-degree manslaughter. He faces up to 25 years in prison for the death of the teenage boy in the Wakefield area of the Bronx. Unarmed: Ramarley Graham, 18, was shot and killed at his Bronx home in February by an NYPD officer . Moments before the fatal shooting, an undercover narcotics unit said they spotted the teen adjusting his waistband and thought he had a gun. He was followed into his apartment where he had been hiding in the bathroom before Officer Haste allegedly shot the young man. Mr Graham had not been carrying a gun and no weapon was found at the scene. He was rushed to Montefiore Medical Center, where he later died. It prompted calls of overly aggressive policing and mass protests in the Bronx community. The Bronx District Attorney’s Office found that Haste not only didn't follow procedure, but broke the law by opening fire, according to the New York Post. Grief: Constance Malcolm, mother of Ramarley Graham, is comforted after her unarmed son was shot dead in his bathroom . Gunned down: Officer Richard Haste, 30, is expected to be indicted for the shooting of Mr Graham . Attorney for the Graham family told the paper 'we expect an indictment and are waiting for it'. At the time of her son's death his mother Constance Malcolm, 39, told the Daily News: 'They chased him into the house. Nobody deserves to be shot in their own home.' Mr Graham did have a small amount of marijuana in his possession after he was spotted buying it on the street. Once inside, he headed for the bathroom, apparently trying to flush marijuana he had away, with two officers behind him. The police initially claimed a struggle had followed in which the teen was shot in the upper left chest. Anger: The Bronx community against the actions of the police following the shooting an unarmed 18-year-old . However, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said that he did not believe the officers had struggled with the suspect before he was shot. According to Mr Kelly’s account, as Mr Graham tried to flush drugs down the toilet, one of the officers yelled: 'Show me your hands! Show me your hands! Gun! Gun!' That officer then shot him with his service weapon, a 9mm Glock. 'We need to continue to gather facts at this juncture,' Mr Kelly said. 'We see an unarmed person being shot. That always concerns us.'","Ramarley Graham, 18, shot dead in his bathroom in February .

A South African court has found black farmhand Chris Mahlangu guilty of murdering Eugene Terre’Blanche, a white supremacist prominent during the dying years of apartheid, in a wage dispute. A second man, who was a minor at the time of the April 2010 murder, was found guilty of housebreaking in Ventersdorp, a farming community about 80 miles west of Johannesburg where Terre’Blanche owned a farm. Chis Mahlangu was found guilty of murdering white supremacist Eugene Terre'Blanche with an axe . The case has served as a reminder of the bitter historical divisions in a country now dubbed the 'Rainbow Nation' and ruled by the African National Congress, the party that helped end apartheid in 1994. Many see Terre’Blanche as a relic from a bygone era, with his murder doing little to stir fresh racial tension. 'After all the evidence given, I conclude that accused number one is guilty as charged,' said Judge John Horn. Protesters awaiting the verdict are confronted by police during a demonstration for the accused outside the court in Ventersdorp, South Africa . Prosecutors said Mahlangu and his co-accused broke into Terre’Blanche’s home, where they found the 71-year-old asleep and bludgeoned him to death with an axe. Terre’Blanche, a burly man known for his thick white beard and fiery rhetoric, led the hardline supremacist Afrikaner Resistance Movement. Its members adopted military uniforms and flags with a symbol reminiscent of the Nazi swastika, and called for an all-white homeland in the post-apartheid South Africa.

An entire suburb in New Zealand has been put on 'lockdown' and the nation is on Red Alert after the capture of a feared invader. Jitters spread throughout the country after the discovery of a single male Queensland fruit fly, described as the world's worst fruit pest. It was trapped in the Auckland suburb of Mount Roskill - and resulted in the entire area being declared a 'controlled zone', meaning that no fruit or vegetables can be removed. Jitters spread throughout the country after the discovery of a single male Queensland fruit fly, described as the world's worst fruit pest . Such is the concern about the discovery of the tiny fly, which is about twice the size of a match head, that Primary Industries Minister David Carter ordered the country's trading partners, which include Britain, about the alarm. Fruit flies are feared by all fruit-producing nations because they puncture the skin to lay their eggs. The fruit surrounding the egg begins to rot and then, when the eggs hatch, the maggots start gnawing through the rest of the fruit causing it to fall, wasted, to the ground. The single fly found in the Auckland suburb has terrified the government, which regards it as a sign that others might be prevalent, threatening the £2 billion fruit and vegetable export industry. As the biochemistry experts searched the suburb for other flies, Mr Carter said this was a potentially serious biosecurity issue and it was important to start notifying the country's trading partners. 'We need to quickly find out whether this trapping involves a single insect or whether a breeding population has been established - in which case an eradication response will be commenced immediately,' he said. Mr Peter Silcock, chief executive of Horticulture New Zealand, said the industry, which is in the middle of its export season, was waiting with 'bated breath' for further developments. Queensland fruit flies 'sting' fruit - the fruit surrounding the egg begins to rot and then, when the eggs hatch, the maggots start gnawing through the rest of the fruit causing it to fall, wasted, to the ground . 'There's only one fly, it's a male and we're hoping that's all there is,' he said. It is the first time a fruit fly has been discovered in New Zealand since the discovery of a Mediterranean fruit by in 1996. It is believed the Queensland fruit fly has arrived through fresh fruit - but there are fears that others have come with it.

The gory details of singer Whitney Houston's lonely death have finally been laid bare. Whitney's . body was discovered face down in the bath tub, 'her eyes were congested . and there was a bloody purge coming from her nose.' There . was 'superficial abrasions to the left side of her forehead and the . bridge of her nose.' She also had cuts on her left arm, hand and . shoulder. It was a sordid end for the award-winning star, and officials insist there were absolutely no signs of foul play. They . do note that the water in the bath where Whitney was found, with some . evidence of trauma including a cut lip, was 'extremely hot.' Not surprisingly, the beloved performer, . who was due to attend her mentor Clive Davis' Grammy Party at the same . hotel that night, had scald marks on her back. The report also confirms details of the drug paraphernalia found amidst the minutiae of the diva's final hours. There was a 'spoon with a white crystal-like substance on it' and a . 'white powdery substance' which was later tested and determined to be . cocaine in the late singer's hotel room. The report, which gives a detailed description of the state of the Beverly Hilton hotel room when officials arrived reads: 'Located on the south portion of the counter was a small spoon with a white crystal-like substance in it and a rolled up piece of white paper, along with other miscellaneous items.' 'Located in the top drawer, in the north side of the counter were remnants of a white powdery substance, and a portable mirror on a base.' Officials found more white powder on the base of the mirror. It also reveals the probable cause of death: '[Whitney] possibly overdosed on a narcotic substance, prescription medications, over the counter medications and alcohol.' Singer Whitney Elisebeth Houston was pronounced dead at quarter to four in the afternoon but almost six hours later at twenty-five to ten at night, the temperature in the bathtub was still 93.5 degrees. The final autopsy: This report contains all the gory details, and it's heartbreaking . Narrative: The police detective pieced together exactly what she discovered in the initial aftermath . The level of Whitney's drug abuse was evident due to a 'perforation of posterior nasal septum.' The report also notes that when officials discovered the body, Whitney was wearing a brown wig 'tightly attached to the hair.' The wig was removed revealing a a full head of wavy black hair with 'no balding.' Houston also had traces of marijuana in her system as well as Xanax (anxiety medication), Flexeril (muscle relaxer) and Benadryl (allergy medication). The report also describes a plastic bag ripped open with pills spilling out, medication bottles and an ashtray with cigarette butts all over the place. What happened: The final hour of Whitney's life is accounted for here . Tragic: Whitney's death was ruled an accident, with all suggestions of foul play disregarded . When the 48-year-old singer's official cause of death was released in March her heart disease was mentioned, but the new detailed report also cites that she had a hole in her septum and that she was suffering from mild emphysema. Kristy McCracken of the Beverly Hills Police Department also noticed an old needle puncture wound on Houston's inner left elbow. On the day she died, Whitney Houston complained of a sore throat, so she decided to take a bath in at her hotel room at the Beverly Hilton before getting ready for Clive's party. Sad details: The report mentioned that Whitney had benign tumours in her uterus . Secene: Whitney was found in her bathtub in the Wilshire Tower at the exclusive Beverly Hilton Hotel on February 11 . The singer's assistant left Houston to run an errand at department store Neiman Marcus. When the assistant returned to the singer's room around 3:35 p.m. on Saturday Feb. 11, Houston was lying face down in the bathtub in approximately 13-inches of water. Devastated: Whitney with Bobbi two days before she died . The singer was pulled out of the tub by her assistant and bodyguard so resuscitation attempts could be made. Whitney was found to be well-nourished, with a thick head of hair and scars from breast implant surgery. Meanwhile, it has emerged that the singer's 19-year-old daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown, is facing intervention from her family and friends. She has allegedly turned to pills and marijuana to help her cope with the trauma of her mother's death. According to America's Star magazine, Bobbi's aunt Pat recently arranged for several close family members and friends of the youngster to speak to her about her substance use, but their words fell on deaf ears. A source said: 'Everyone is worried sick about Krissy ... her aunt Pat got a number of her friends and family to come to Atlanta and have a serious talk with her about her sobriety. There were lots of tears, but Bobbi Kristina didn't listen.' Pat has even asked Whitney's long-term mentor Clive Davis to speak to Bobbi - whose father is the late singer's ex-husband Bobby Brown - about her problems. The source added: 'Clive keeps telling Bobbi she needs to go to rehab, and that if she does, he'll help launch her music career. He's doing everything he can.'

His . dishonesty was only discovered later when he applied to . buy his council flat in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, for £83,000 under a . Right to Buy scheme and said he would pay in cash. Those paying his benefits were immediately suspicious and an investigation of his financial affairs began. Today, Putman pleaded guilty to two counts of benefit fraud when he appeared at St Albans Magistrates’ Court in Hertfordshire. The 47-year-old, who was jailed for seven years for raping a 17-year-old woman at her home in Milton Keynes in 1993, scooped his windfall in September 2009 and spent the cash on two sports cars and houses. At the time of the attack, the woman was pregnant with his child and despite her injuries her unborn child survived and is now 19. He has never received a penny in support from his biological father, who also has a conviction for violence, and now his mother is planning on suing him for the agony he caused her and wants to 'see him penniless'. Today, magistrates said the offences were . too serious for sentencing under the powers available to them, and the . case was committed to St Albans Crown Court on July 24. Protection: Putman is pictured leaving court trying to shield his face and with an entourage of bodyguards . Cheat: Edward Putman, left, in September 1999 and right, at a recent court appearance. He began receiving income support in 2000 after being incapacitated by anxiety issues and his benefits were suspended in 2009 . The court heard Putman began receiving income support in 2000 on the basis of his being incapacitated by anxiety issues. In . order to do so he needed proof from his doctor of his mental health . problems and signed a document confirming that he would notify the . authorities if his condition changed. But . when he failed to attend a medical check-up in 2009, his benefits were . suspended, before being officially ended in April the following year. In . July 2010, 10 months after being made a millionaire by his lottery win, . he wrote to the Department of Work and Pensions, begging them to . reinstate his benefits. He claimed he did not attend the medical examination because he was too ill. 'I lost a lot of weight and had lot to deal with,' he wrote. 'I didn’t know whether I would still be alive. I’m on the brink of being evicted.' Riches: Edward Putman's £600,000 four-bedroom home in Kings Langley, Hertfordshire. He won the lottery in 2009 and spent the money on two sports cars and a new house . Property: Putman's home from the front. The authorities became suspicious when he went to council wanting to buy his council house under the right-to-buy scheme telling them he had the £84,000 needed to buy it in cash . He also wrote to Dacorum Borough Council saying that he had been forced to survive on handouts from his family and friends, and had not been able to pay his council tax or rent, apart from putting £200 towards it, which he had borrowed from his family. The court heard that his benefits were then reinstated and were also back-dated, as he had asked them to be, to January 2010. But the court heard that the authorities became suspicious when, that October, he went to the council asking if he could buy his council house under the right-to-buy scheme, telling them he had the £84,000 needed to buy it in cash. Further investigation then found that Putman also had an account with St James’s Bank - the bank recommended to lottery winners by operator Camelot. Edward Putman's victim has told how she was pregnant with his child when he raped her . Its records showed that, on September 10 2009, two large sums of cash were paid into his account with them - one for just over £2.5 million, and the other for £2.4 million, prosecutor Hita Mashru said. Putman was invited to be interviewed under caution, in which he said he had not spent any of the money he received in benefits because he knew it would have to be paid back. The court heard he claimed a total of £4,809.18 from Dacorum Borough Council between September 2009 and October 2010, and £8,033.59 from the Department for Work and Pensions between between September 2009 and May last year. 'When you look at the entirety of the facts in full in relation to how this has gone about, it’s very calculating,' Ms Mashru said. She added that Putman had opted not to go public with his lottery win. 'You may see that it’s very clear why. He has previous convictions and the fact that he was claiming benefits, clearly any publicity would have warned the Department for Work and Pensions that he was a person who should not have been receiving benefits.' During mitigation, the court heard that the defendant had admitted his deceit during questioning and had now paid back the money he owed in full. Bearded Putman sat at the front of the court dressed in a grey anorak and grey trousers. He was released on unconditional bail until his sentencing.","Edward Putman pleaded guilty to two counts of benefit fraud today .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 09:08 EST, 26 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:17 EST, 26 June 2012 . From a chapel pulpit on Lackland Air Force Base, where every American airman reports for basic training, Col. Glenn Palmer delivered his first order to nearly 600 recruits seated in the pews: If you're sexually harassed or assaulted, tell someone. 'My job is to give you a safe, effective training environment,' Palmer said firmly. What the colonel did not mention directly in his recent address was a widening sex scandal that has rocked the base, one of the nation's busiest military training centers. Victims?: Female airmen march during graduation at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio . Allegations that male instructors had sex with, and in one case raped, female trainees have led to criminal charges against four men. Charges against others are possible. The most serious accusations surround an Air Force staff sergeant scheduled to face a court-martial in July on charges that include rape and multiple counts of aggravated sexual assault. The other three defendants were charged with lesser crimes ranging from sexual misconduct to adultery. All of the defendants were assigned to turn raw recruits into airmen in eight weeks of basic training. A two-star general is now investigating alongside a separate criminal probe, which military prosecutors say could sweep up more airmen. Advocates for female service members and members of Congress have started taking notice. 'It's a pretty big scandal the Air Force is having to deal with at this point,' said Greg Jacob, a former Marine infantry officer and policy director of the Service Women's Action Network. 'It's pretty substantial in its scope.' Col. Glenn Palmer (pictured) advised recruits: If you're sexually harassed or assaulted, tell someone but did not mention the scandal . Yet there are signs the Air Force still doesn't have a handle on the full depth of the problem. Staff Sgt. Peter Vega-Maldonado pleaded guilty earlier this month to having sex with a female trainee and struck a plea deal for 90 days' confinement. Then he acknowledged being involved with a total of 10 trainees — a number previously unknown to investigators. On Friday, after months of embarrassing disclosures, the head of the Air Force's training command ordered Maj. Gen. Margaret H. Woodward to lead an independent investigation. That same day, the Air Force gave reporters rare access to Lackland's instructional headquarters in an effort to show there was nothing to hide. The headquarters facility is where Lackland trains the people who train recruits. Inside one small classroom, three women and two men were lectured on the importance of having a moral compass while watching a slide presentation titled 'Integrity First'. Lackland has about 475 instructors for the nearly 36,000 airmen who will graduate this year. That's about 85 per cent of what Lackland would consider a full roster of instructors, a demanding job that requires airmen to work longer hours than most for four years, at the expense of family and personal time. The Air Force recently launched a smartphone app to help recruit instructors. Topping a page of frequently asked questions is whether the divorce rate for instructors really is higher. (The Air Force says no.) Palmer said that a slight shortage in instructors has not lowered the standards for applicants. In response to the allegations, he said instructor training is being revamped and that he was accountable for problems within the training wing. Leaders of the instructor program, however, said the responsibility falls on the accused. 'A person sitting in that seat, they're going to do what they're going to do when no one is watching,' said Master Sgt. Greg Pendleton, who oversees the training. 'That's across the board. That's just them. When we're outside this door or outside these walls, there are individuals that have their own personal values.' Military personnel stand outside the Lackland Air Force Base in Texas, one of the nation's busiest military training centers, where four male instructors are charged with having sex with, and in one case raping, female trainees . So widespread is the fallout that Lackland halted operations for an entire day in March to survey about 5,900 trainees about whether they had seen or been a victim of sexual misconduct. It was a highly unusual move for a vast 15-square-mile base that runs with relentless efficiency. A new class of airmen graduates every Friday for 50 of the 52 weeks in the year. At first, Palmer, commander of the 737th training wing, said he wasn't sure that halting training was even possible. Airman Andrea Madison, a new graduate who was in basic training at the height of the investigation at Lackland, said she never felt uncomfortable with her instructors. 'They want to make sure no foul play is happening, no one is taking advantage of us,' said Madison, of Columbus, Ohio. Last week, one commander of a Lackland training squadron caught up in the sex scandal was dismissed after the Air Force lost confidence in his leadership. Col. Polly Kenny, 2nd Air Force Staff, said the dismissal was not directly related to the sexual misconduct investigation. The Service Women's Action Network supports and works with servicewomen . Nearly three dozen instructors at Lackland have also been removed in the past year, but the Air Force will not say how many lost their jobs as a result of the investigation that began last fall, only that the majority of dismissals were unrelated. The first sexual misconduct allegations at Lackland surfaced a year ago against Staff Sgt. Luis Walker, who is charged with 28 counts. Walker, the only instructor who has been accused of sexually assaulting another airman, faces life in prison if convicted. His civilian attorney, Joseph Esparza, has declined to speak with reporters and did not return multiple calls for comment. Sexual assault victims are reassigned and can apply for a 'humanitarian discharge' from the military, but Lackland civilian spokeswoman Collen McGhee said she did not know whether those affected by this case had done so.","The first sexual misconduct allegations at Lackland surfaced a year ago against Staff Sgt.

Lord Turner arriving to give evidence to the Treasury Select Committee at Portcullis House yesterday . The manipulation of key interest rates by Barclays is just 'the tip of the iceberg', the City's regulator warned yesterday. Barclays was fined a record £290million and its three most senior managers have been forced to resign over its involvement in the rigging of Libor, the inter-bank lending rate. Speaking before MPs on the Treasury Select Committee, Lord Turner, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, said other banks may find themselves implicated in the financial scandal. He added: 'We don't know, but I would be amazed if this was everything.' His colleague, Tracey McDermott, acting director of financial crime at the FSA, confirmed it is investigating seven other banks. In a further twist, Jerry del Missier, the former chief operating officer at Barclays, told MPs he was clearly told by Bob Diamond, his former boss at the bank, to cut Libor during a telephone conversation on October 29, 2008. He said: 'I took the action on the basis of the phone call that I had had with Mr Diamond.' Mr Diamond strenuously denies he gave such an instruction. Mr del Missier, who is rumoured to have been paid £6.5million last year, said: 'He [Bob Diamond] said that he had a conversation with Paul Tucker of the Bank of England, that the Bank of England was getting pressure from Whitehall around Barclays, the health of Barclays as a result of Libor rates and that we should get our Libor rates down.' Accusation: Jerry del Missier, the former chief operating officer at Barclays, told MPs he was clearly told by Bob Diamond, pictured, to cut Libor during a telephone conversation on October 29, 2008 . Andrew Bailey, head of the regulator's prudential business unit, said of Barclays: 'There was a problem with this institution and that problem came from the top'. Asked whether he meant Mr Diamond, he said: 'Yes.' It also emerged yesterday that Barclays staff told Stephen Morse, the head of compliance at the bank, about the controversial instruction to lower Libor. Last night, Barclays refused to reveal whether or not Mr Morse still works for the bank, although he is currently listed as 'inactive' on the City regulator's list of authorised people.","Lord Turner said other banks may find .

As excitement builds for the Queen’s Jubilee, spoilsport council officials in one town have put a serious dampener on preparations by traders. Patriotic shop owners in Cheltenham want to hang Union flag and Olympics bunting across the road outside their businesses. But health and safety officials said they need to take out a £5m insurance policy to cover the cost of redirecting traffic while the flags are put up. Frustration: High street traders along Bath Road in Cheltenham have had to abandon plans to hang bunting across the road because council chiefs are insisting they take out £5million insurance cover . Shopkeepers had planned to hang the string of red, white and blue flags in an eye-catching zig-zag pattern down the length of the street, echoing scenes from other towns across the country. Members of the Bath Road Traders’ Association have now scrapped the display - and instead plan to simply hang the bunting in parallel lines above the pavement. The news is an upsetting blow for resident Joan Clifford, 78, who painstakingly stitched the strings together and measured them exactly to fit the street. But Gloucestershire Highways insisted on a raft of safety measures when erecting the display, including road closures, diversions and the hire of hydraulic cherry-pickers. Officials ruled that any such an operation would require £5million worth of public liability insurance. Lizzie Smith, chairman of the association, said she thought the ruling was unnecessary: 'It is rules for rules and they are a bunch of party poopers,’ she said. Patriotic: Members of Bath Road Traders' Association with the Olympic bunting they made. It will now be hung along the street instead of zig-zagging across it . Proud: Residents had even marked the bunting so it would fit exactly between lampposts when it was strung across the road. 'We were happy to hire a cherry picker to get up there and would have paid for that ourselves. 'But nobody was willing to take on a £5 million public liability policy, which is quite understandable.' The association began planning decorations for the Olympic torch and . Jubilee following a successful Christmas party on the street.Local resident Mrs Clifford, from Leckhampton, offered to hand make bunting and the shops launched an appeal for fabric donations. The talented seamstress and her friends painstakingly cut and made the bunting in red, white and blue for the Jubilee and blue, yellow, black, green and red for the Olympics. They even marked the bunting so it would fit exactly between lampposts when it was strung across the road. Killjoys: Highways officials said they are not asking for insurance to cover the bunting, but to cover the risks associated with installing it . Ms Smith, manager of homemade food shop Cook, added: 'It would have looked so much better if we had been able to string it across the street. 'I think it is amazing that a 78-year-old woman came forward and volunteered to make the bunting, which was such a massive job. Imagine cutting it all. 'She had specially made it so that it would fit perfectly between the lampposts, there were even tabs with instructions sewn into the bunting to say where it went. 'I have seen other towns with bunting strung across the road and I’m sure there wasn’t all this fuss.' The 45-member association was hit with a letter from Gloucestershire Highways five weeks before the Olympic torch passed through the street last week. Result: Traders said they would be looking into the possibility of taking out insurance for future events . Thousands of locals lined popular Bath Road to see the iconic torch as it made its way through Cheltenham. Ms Smith added that the association had not looked into the cost of buying a £5 million public liability policy but would do so for future events.Chris Riley from Gloucestershire Highways said the £5 million insurance would have covered the disruption of erecting the bunting. He said: 'We are not asking for insurance to cover the bunting, but insurance is needed to put it up as a traffic management plan would have to be put in place to put it up and take it down and for a cherry picker to be used. 'It is the installation process which needs covering and it is exactly the same for the district council when they put the Christmas lights up for example.

Libya's Prime Minister has claimed his country's former head of intelligence holds the key to solving the murder of policewoman Yvonne Fletcher, who was shot dead outside London's Libyan embassy in 1984. Leader Abdurrahim El-Keib, who yesterday visited the spot where Wpc Fletcher was shot dead, described Abdullah al-Senussi as the 'black box' who would know who carried out the killing. Senussi was one of Muammar Gaddafi's most senior henchmen who fled Libya last year and was arrested in Mauritania in March. He is wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. He is also suspected of involvement in the Lockerbie bombing. Dramatic: Members of the security team of Libyan Prime Minister Abdurrahim El-Keib's pose for photos at the spot where Yvonne Fletcher was shot dead . Mr El-Keib, Libya's interim prime minister, said Abdul Senussi - also Gaddafi’s brother-in-law - was central to solving the murder case. He added: ‘He’s the black box. I guarantee he was almost directly or indirectly involved in most if not all of the crimes [of the former regime]. That doesn’t mean others weren’t involved. But he definitely knows who they were.' A team of detectives from the Metropolitan Police are to fly to Libya to continue their investigations into the unsolved murder, it was announced this week. During yesterday's visit, the Libyan prime minister paused and bowed in front of the memorial to Wpc Fletcher and laid a wreath of white roses and carnations at the spot. But Mr El-Keib said yesterday his country would 'work very closely together' with the UK after talks with Prime Minister David Cameron. Joining the Prime Minister at the memorial were two of his body guards who - with their sunglasses, designer stubble and smart suits - struck a seemingly dramatic stance,reaching out an arm to grasp the metal railings behind, for the camera. Respect: Libyan interim Prime Minister Abdel Rahim al-Kib prepares to lay a wreath in London, at the spot where British policewoman Yvonne Fletcher was shot dead . Investigation: Abdurrahim el-Keib has pledged that his country would work closely with the British government in a renewed investigation of the killing . WPC Fletcher, who was 25, was shot dead as she policed an anti-Gaddafi demonstration outside the Libyan People’s Bureau. She was cradled by colleague John Murray, who has been behind a long-running campaign to find justice for her. What is known is that the bullets which killed her and injured ten protesters came from inside the embassy. No-one has ever been brought to justice for the killing. Ms Fletcher's mother Queenie, father Tim and sister Sarah Parsons have been hoping to see justice for their daughter ever since. WPC Fletcher’s death led to an 11-day siege of the building in St James’s Square and the severing of diplomatic links between Britain and Libya. Mr El-Keib worked with the opposition while in exile during Gaddafi’s dictatorship and said he knew some of those involved in the demonstration. Tribute: The memorial to murdered British policewoman Yvonne Fletcher . Mr El-Keib worked with the opposition while in exile during Muammar Gaddafi's dictatorship, and said he knew some of those involved in the demonstration. Senussi is wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity in Libya while France wants to try him in connection with the 1989 bombing of an airline over Niger in which 170 people died. He may also have some information about the Lockerbie bombing. Officers from New Scotland Yard and Home Office Minister James Brokenshire met Mr El-Keib today to discuss the Fletcher case. Commander Richard Walton, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism said he was determined to get justice for Ms Fletcher. He added: 'We have never lost our resolve to solve this murder and achieve justice for Yvonne's family. We see today's announcement as significant.' Detectives remain in regular contact with Wpc Fletcher's family and update them on developments. Tragic: The killing of Wpc Yvonne Fletcher sparked an 11 day police siege of the Libyan embassy in St James's Square . Mr El-Keib said Libya wanted to be 'long-term friends and partners' with Britain, and paid tribute to the role which the UK played in the international military mission to protect civilians from Gaddafi's forces during last year's uprising. Addressing Mr Cameron he said: 'You took a bold decision when it was very difficult for many to even consider supporting the Libyan people. You took that decision which inspired many of us.' Mr Cameron said: 'I am very proud of the role that Britain played to help secure a successful outcome in Libya and the support we gave through the Nato mission. 'I am very much looking forward to hearing about the progress towards a full democracy in Libya and the elections which you hope to hold before Ramadan this year.' Mr El-Keib was appointed interim prime minister of Libya in October last year. Elections for a national assembly for Libya are expected in June or July, though no date has yet been set. Mr Cameron and Mr El-Keib were also thought to be discussing the reconstruction of the country following last year's revolution. Changing Times: David Cameron said allowing British police to fly to Libya investigate Wpc Fletcher's killing was a really positive step. Diplomatic relations were cut with Libyan leader Muammar Gadaffi, right, following the incident in 1984 . And just days after the death of the only person convicted of the Lockerbie bombing, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, they may also discuss whether any further evidence relating to the atrocity has emerged in the wake of the downfall of the Gaddafi regime. Mr El-Keib spent much of his life working abroad as an academic and businessman in the United States and UAE, and played no part in Gaddafi's administration. David Cameron, left, greets Libya's Prime Minister, Abdurrahim el-Keib before their meeting at 10 Downing Street . Speaking today, he dismissed his predecessor's regime saying his nation 'was a country where Libyans felt like aliens' and where people lived 'as close as you can get to the poverty line'. Saying that citizens 'lived in fear of the security apparatus', he spelt out his objectives for the country after elections are held on June 19 - for which 2.5 million people have registered to vote. The premier said life had already changed in the short time since Gaddafi's downfall with freedom of the press, human rights and transparency as cornerstones of life. 'These are special values that caused the revolution to take place,' he said. He also promised laws banning people from insulting Libya and glorifying Gaddafi would be erased after the election. Speaking at a talk in London, titled Re-establishing The State, Mr El-Keib said: 'I guarantee such laws will disappear completely.' The prime minister also spoke of the massive job of rebuilding the country and its infrastructure with health, education and the economy high on his list of priorities. 'Under the circumstances we have been making excellent progress and we have been making that progress continuously to democracy and the rule of law,' he said. Mr El-Keib told the audience of 250 that the times of corrupt deals being organised had gone.Contracts for rebuilding the nation would no longer get signed off by ""just the man upstairs and he then starts asking you to do him favours'. Referring to the country's oil and gas capabilities and future business with international companies, Mr El-Keib said: ""The door is well open in a transparent fashion. 'You are welcome, everyone, that can help us move forward and enhance our production in the future.'

The semi-precious stone seal is thought to date back to the end of Temple period and is engraved with the words Matanyahu Ben Ho which means 'giving to God' in Hebrew. Sign of the times: Archaelogists have discovered this small stone . engraved with the name 'Matanayahu'. They believe it was used to stamp . letters with the owners mark 2,700 years ago . It is believed that the small stone was probably originally set in a signet ring and used as a personal seal by its owner so they could sign letters with it. From the start of the excavations in this area archaeologists decided that all of the soil removed from the area would be sifted very carefully using a process called wet sifting. The dig is being carried out in cooperation with thousands of pupils in the Tzurim Valley National Park and it was during the sieving process that the tiny seal was discovered. Names like matanyahu were typical of those used in the Kingdom of Judah in latter part of the First Temple period - from the end of the eighth century BC until the destruction of the Temple in 586 BC. To find a seal from the First Temple period at the foot of the Temple Mount walls is said to be extremely rare. Shards . of pottery characteristic of the period were also found on the floor in . the ancient building beneath the base of the drainage channel, as well . as  evidence of a fire.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . CREATED: . 06:02 EST, 29 May 2012 . For years, it has been used as a metaphor for a never-ending job. Now the Forth Rail Bridge could soon be recognised for more prestigious reasons than simply the continual need to keep re-painting it. The bridge, described by some Scots as the eighth wonder of the world, has been invited to prepare a formal bid for World Heritage Status, which would place it alongside such landmarks as the Taj Mahal and the Great Wall of China. Iconic: The Forth Bridge, which spans the Firth of Forth in Scotland, has been invited to apply to Unesco to become a World Heritage site . Never-ending... at least until last Christmas: The paint job was started in 1883 when the bridge was built and continually needed re-coating due to the elements. It was finally finished in December (above) thanks to some super-strong paint . The crossing was included on a shortlist submitted to Unesco - the body which awards the honour - earlier this year. An independent expert group has now recommended that the Forth Rail Bridge bid should go forward. The bridge, which spans the Firth of Forth, became famous because the task of painting the structure was an endless one. It was finally completed last December thanks to a new super-tough paint and it shouldn’t need doing again for 25 years. Work in progress: The rail crossing in 1889. Construction took eight years to complete at a cost of £3.2million, around £235million today . Perpetual painting: Workmen carrying out the endless, and painstaking, task of re-coating the bridge in 1931 . Officials have been invited to prepare a formal nomination, which could go forward in 2014, with Unesco then expected to make a final decision on heritage status in June 2015. Heritage Minister John Penrose described the crossing, which was completed in 1890 and carries about 200 trains a day, as a 'strong contender'. If successful, it would be the sixth World Heritage Site in Scotland. Scottish Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop said: 'The Forth Bridge is a Scottish icon that is recognised the world over. 'We are extremely excited that we have the opportunity to make the case for the bridge being inscribed as Scotland’s sixth World Heritage Site. 'To have the bridge inscribed as a Unesco World Heritage Site would be a tremendous accolade for the bridge itself, for the local communities and for Scotland. 'This nomination has the potential to be a celebration of our country’s incredible engineering ingenuity and pedigree, and I wish the team working on it all the best.' Prestigious company: The Forth Bridge could join the likes of the Taj Mahal (above) in India in gaining World Heritage Status . Rich history: The Great Wall of China (pictured) is also a World Heritage site, highlighting just how highly regarded the Forth Bridge in cultural circles . The nomination will be overseen by the Forth Bridges Forum, which includes representatives from Historic Scotland, the Scottish Government agency charged with safeguarding the country’s historic environment, and bridge owners Network Rail, among others. David Simpson, route managing director for Network Rail Scotland, described the crossing as 'one of the most recognisable bridges anywhere in the world'. He added: 'The bridge has become a source of pride and a symbol of Scotland’s resilience and ingenuity but, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is first and foremost a working structure which still carries over 200 trains a day. 'Extremely excited': Scottish Culture Minister Fiona Hyslop said the Forth Bridge is a Scottish icon that is recognised the world over . 'This nomination should be regarded as a further tribute to the thousands of men who have contributed to building, maintaining and restoring the structure over the last 130 years.' The Forth Rail Bridge is 2.5 kilometres (1.55 miles) long and was built with about 54,000 tonnes of steel and an estimated 6.5 million rivets. Work started on it in 1882 and the project, which took eight years to complete, cost £3.2 million - equivalent to £235 million today. Scottish Secretary Michael Moore hailed the structure as 'an iconic symbol of Scotland which is instantly recognised the world over'. He also described the bridge as a 'huge feat of Scottish engineering skill' and said: 'It was nominated for Unesco World Heritage Status by the UK Government last year and the fact it has topped the list and can now take its bid forward is good news for Scotland.' Gorham’s Cave Complex in Gibraltar - four sea caves lying at the base of the 426-metre high Rock of Gibraltar - has also been invited to prepare a nomination for World Heritage Status. This could go forward in 2015, with a decision from Unesco then expected the following year. Mr Penrose said: 'The UK’s heritage is unique, diverse and world-class. 'Nomination to Unesco for World Heritage Status is incredibly rewarding, but the process is pretty tough and success is by no means guaranteed. 'Both the Forth Bridge and Gorham’s Cave are strong contenders, so I wish them all the best.' The current World Heritage Sites in Scotland are the Antonine Wall, St Kilda, New Lanark, the Heart of Neolithic Orkney and Edinburgh Old and New towns. Antonine WallBuilt during the years following 142 AD on the orders of the Emperor Antoninus Pius, the wall was once the Roman Empire's most northen frontier in Britain. The structure survived for a generation before being abandoned in the 160s in favour of a return to Hadrian's Wall. It stretched for nearly 60km from Bo’ness on the River Forth to Old Kilpatrick on the River Clyde.St KildaThe archipelago, which is the remotest part of the British Isles, lies 66Km west of Benbecula in Scotland's Outer Hebrides. People had lived there since prehistoric times, but the last islanders asked to be evacuated in 1930 because life on the remote archipelago had become too difficult, mainly as a result of tourism and World War I. Edinburgh Old and New townsThese were made a World Heritage site in 1995 in recognition of their unique character. The New town is considered a masterpiece is city planning. New LanarkThe 18th century restored cotton mill village on the banks of the River Clyde in Southern Scotland was inscribed by UNESCO in 2001. It was created as a cotton-spinning village and was transformed under the management of Robert Owen, who improved conditions and facilities for the workers. The Heart of Neolithic OrkneyThe group of Neolithic monuments on Orkney consists of a large chambered tomb (Maes Howe), two ceremonial stone circles (the Stones of Stenness and the Ring of Brodgar) and a settlement (Skara Brae), together with a number of unexcavated burial, ceremonial and settlement sites. The group constitutes a major prehistoric cultural landscape which gives a graphic depiction of life in this remote archipelago in the far north of Scotland some 5,000 years ago.",Scottish rail crossing could join likes of Taj Mahal and Great Wall of China .

Students at the University of Colorado are being told their guns are now welcome in the classroom thanks to a newly overturned state law surrounding the Denver movie theater shooting last month, but their dormitories are still off limits. Complying with a state Supreme Court ruling in March that overturned a 1994 ban on firearms on school campuses, reluctant school officials in Boulder have compromised by providing off-campus housing strictly for those wishing to live with their guns. Welcome back: A rule prohibiting weapons on the University of Colorado, their Boulder campus pictured, has been overturned for those students and faculty with concealed carry permits . They say the students it would accommodate are a part of .6 per cent of the faculty, staff and students who have a concealed carry permit and that 96 per cent of incoming freshmen are already ineligible for the permit due to age. Still, the weapons’ welcome has left many unnerved. ‘Yeah, it makes me very uncomfortable, sure,' Cindy Rosenthal, an Arizona mother helping move in her freshmen daughter told NPR this week. 'I definitely would not feel safe if they allowed guns on campus, in the halls. I would not be comfortable with that at all.' Concern over the firearms' permission also caused one university professor to threaten cancelling class if he learned any of his students were carrying a firearm inside. Dorm ban: The university said that they will comply with the rule but not in on-campus dormitories, offering off-campus housing to those who wish to live with their firearms . Exceptions: Concealed firearms will be permitted in all university buildings, with the exception of large, ticketed public events such as concerts and football games, their stadium pictured . Professor Jerry Paterson's threat on Tuesday was overturned by the university's chancellor Philip P DiStefano who threatened disciplinary action to his faculty if any such action were taken, accusing them of being in violation of their contracts. 'I believe we have taken reasonable steps to adhere to the ruling of the Colorado Supreme Court, while balancing that with the priority of providing a safe environment for our students, faculty and staff,' said Mr DiStefano in a statement. Mr Peterson, a physics professor and chairman of the Boulder Faculty Assembly, said he would stand by his own policy on classroom weapons and argued a student with a gun would be a classroom distraction. The permission of firearms comes amid a nationwide debate on gun control after a gunman who police identified as a former University of Colorado graduate student killed 12 people when he opened fire at a suburban Denver movie theater last month. Upset: One university professor told his students he would cancel class if he found out that one of his students had a weapon in his classroom, causing a warning by the school's chancellor . Suspected gunman James Holmes, 24, had been a neuroscience graduate student at the school and was living in a privately owned apartment off campus when the attack took place. Law enforcement officers have maintained their right to carry weapons on the Colorado campus. University officials said students with gun permits can request their relocation to the university-owned married and graduate student housing across two of the university's four campuses, the obliging campuses being in Boulder and Colorado Springs. 'Obviously, our prime imperative is to provide a safe learning environment,' university spokesman Ken McConnellogue said. 'This balances the requirements of Colorado law with that environment.' Concealed firearms will be permitted in all university buildings, with the exception of large, ticketed public events such as concerts and football games. Any visible guns, knives and explosives are still prohibited. Close to home: The ruling comes amid July's shooting at a movie theatre in Aurora, Colorado that killed 12 by an accused gunman who was a former University of Colorado student . David Burnett, spokesman with Students For Concealed Carry, a nationwide organization of college students that advocates less-restrictive gun policies on campuses, said Colorado's rule was largely positive, but it was still reviewing how the policy will be applied. 'We want safety and security that goes beyond (no firearms allowed) stickers on doors and the goodwill of criminals to abide by them,' Burnett said. 'James Holmes certainly didn't abide by the theater's no firearms ban.' The university’s vice chancellor for student affairs Deb Coffin told NPR that they concerned not of the students with concealed carry permits, but the weapons falling into the wrong hands. 'We're actually more concerned about someone who's not experienced or trained in the use of a handgun getting access to one by accident or on purpose and possibly causing injury to themselves or others.' Incoming freshman Joe Ramsburger from Florida told NPR he understands why guns won't be allowed in his dormitory, but also understands why others would want them. 'Especially with what happened in Aurora a couple of weeks ago, and Virginia Tech, and all of the stuff that's happened on college campuses now ... You never know what's going to happen.'","University of Colorado complying with state Supreme Court ruling that overturned a ban on firearms on campus .

Frank Miles, 69, was only kept dry thanks to the kindness of passers by who shielded him from the downpour by fashioning a makeshift shelter with their own umbrellas. In a desperate bid to find help for the retired civil servant, they dialed 999 six times but were told  there were more important emergencies to tend to - and one operator even hung up to take another call. Slippery: Rotary club members and hotel workers covered Frank Miles in blankets, propped his head up on a pillow, and supported his leg on a cardboard box, as well as calling 999 SIX TIMES for assistance . Mr Miles, from Magor, South Wales, had slipped on rain-soaked decking as he left a rotary club meeting in nearby Newport, leaving him unable to move for the pain and risk of further damage to his leg.

On Earth, solar power has had a slow start, thanks to high prices and inefficient panels - but the first tests on 'solar satellites' offer hope of 'green energy' that actually works.Researchers at Stratchclyde University have already tested equipment in space, a first step for solar panels to collect energy and transfer it back to earth through microwaves or lasers. The researchers aim to produce a 'swarm' of satellites that could one day power whole cities. Initially, the tiny satellites wouldn't replace ordinary power grids - instead, they could swiftly resupply power to disaster areas or outlying districts that are difficult to reach . Solar satellite: The researchers aim to produce a 'swarm' of satellites that could one day power whole cities . Dr Massimiliano Vasile, of Strathclyde¿s Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, is leading the research . Initially the tiny satellites wouldn't replace ordinary power grids - instead, they could swiftly resupply power to disaster areas or outlying districts that are difficult to reach. A 'receiver' on Earth would turn the precisely targeted microwave or laser beams into usable electricity. The idea of solar panels in space has been much discussed - but the new research proves that at least a small-scale version IS possible. Dr Massimiliano Vasile, of the University of Strathclyde’s Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, who is leading the space based solar power research, said: ‘Space provides a fantastic source for collecting solar power and we have the advantage of being able to gather it regardless of the time of the day or indeed the weather conditions.‘In areas like the Sahara desert where quality solar power can be captured, it becomes very difficult to transport this energy to areas where it can be used. 'However, our research is focusing on how we can remove this obstacle and use space based solar power to target difficult to reach areas. 'This would provide a reliable, quality source of energy and would remove the need for storing energy coming from renewable sources on ground as it would provide a constant delivery of solar energy.‘Initially, smaller satellites will be able to generate enough energy for a small village but we have the aim, and indeed the technology available, to one day put a large enough structure in space that could gather energy that would be capable of powering a large city.’Last month, a team of science and engineering students at Strathclyde developed an innovative ‘space web’ experiment which was carried on a rocket from the Arctic Circle to the edge of space. The researchers already deployed a network of satellites which could be used to 'beam' power back to Earth . The experiment, known as Suaineadh – or ‘twisting’ in Scots Gaelic, was an important step forward in space construction design and demonstrated that larger structures could be built on top of a light-weight spinning web, paving the way for the next stage in the solar power project.Dr Vasile added: ‘The success of Suaineadh allows us to move forward with the next stage of our project which involves looking at the reflectors needed to collect the solar power. ‘The current project, called SAM (Self-inflating Adaptable Membrane) will test the deployment of an ultra light cellular structure that can change shape once deployed. The structure is made of cells that are self-inflating in vacuum and can change their volume independently through nanopumps.‘The structure replicates the natural cellular structure that exists in all living things. The independent control of the cells would allow us to morph the structure into a solar concentrator to collect the sunlight and project it on solar arrays. The same structure can be used to build large space systems by assembling thousands of small individual units.’The project is part of a NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts (NIAC) study led by Dr John Mankins of Artemis Innovation. The University of Strathclyde represents the European section of an international consortium involving American researchers, and a Japanese team, led by Professor Nobuyuki Kaya of the University of Kobe, a world leader in wireless power transmission.The NIAC study is demonstrating a new conceptual design for large scale solar power satellites. The role of the team at the University of Strathclyde is to develop innovative solutions for the structural elements and new solutions for orbit and orbit control.","Floating solar panels 'beam' energy to Earth using lasers or microwaves .

Angela Merkel may be willing to sacrifice Greece in order to persuade German voters to bail out the euro, George Osborne warned last night. The Chancellor suggested Germany may ‘require’ the crisis that would follow a Greek exit to convince its voters to take the unpalatable steps needed to rescue the single currency. His comments came as the euro crisis continued to deepen, despite an £80billion bailout of Spain’s banks at the weekend. German Chancellor Angela Merkel could be willing to make the sacrifice in order to demonstrate the importance of saving the single currency . Spain’s borrowing costs rose to a euro-era high of 6.8 percent yesterday after credit ratings agency Fitch brushed aside the rescue fund to issue a fresh downgrade to 18 Spanish banks. Italy’s borrowing rates also jumped to dangerous levels after the Austrian finance minister suggested Italy – the eurozone’s third largest economy – would also need a bailout. Economists have warned a Greek exit could plunge markets into fresh turmoil and spark a new recession across Europe. Ministers and officials are drawing . up contingency plans, including a draconian cap on cashpoint withdrawals . and limits on foreign travel, to deal with the potential fallout. Chancellor George Osborne suggested that Mrs Merkel may require a Grexit to stave off discontent amongst German voters . But speaking at a business summit in London yesterday, Mr Osborne suggested Mrs Merkel may be prepared to allow Greece to leave the euro in order to demonstrate to German voters the need to take costly action to prevent the total collapse of the single currency. International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde has previously called upon leaders to take 'decisive steps to break free of the crisis' ‘I ultimately don’t know whether Greece needs to leave the euro in order for the eurozone to do the things necessary to make their currency survive.’. ‘I just don’t know whether the German government requires Greek exit to explain to their public why they need to do certain things like a banking union, eurobonds and things in common with that.’ The Chancellor also described the failure of Spain’s bank bailout as ‘depressing’ and ‘frustrating’. Treasury sources insisted Mr Osborne was not commenting on the likelihood of a Greek exit. A source said: ‘His point was, do we need another crisis to get decisive action from the eurozone to stand behind its currency.’ Continuing market turmoil fuelled fears European leaders are nowhere near finding a solution to the financial storm that threatens to tear the single currency apart. Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, urged leaders ‘to take decisive steps to break free of the crisis’. Cyprus has indicated it is just days away from asking for a bailout of its own and Greek elections on Sunday could see angry voters push the country out of the euro.","Banking crisis continues to deepen despite £80bn bailout of Spain's banks .

A 'wretched and wicked' primary school teacher used a hidden camera to film young boys changing before posting the images online for other paedophiles. Matthew Ross, 32, hid a tiny camera under his T-shirt to capture the footage of the innocent youngsters. The depraved teacher then posted the footage of the eight and nine-year-old boys on the internet for other pedophiles. 'Wicked': Paedophile Matthew Ross was jailed for three years for filming the young boys . Ross, previously sacked from a teaching job after turning up at school having taken ecstasy, was yesterday jailed for three years for the 'gross abuse of trust'. A court heard his actions only came to light in July last year when police investigated his ex-boyfriend for similar offences. Police who swooped to arrest him even found extreme pornography involving animals and more than 700 indecent images of youngster, ranging from babies to ten-year-olds. The images he filmed of children changing after swimming lessons were of eight and nine-year-old boys. Judge John Lodge, sentencing, said: 'What makes this case so serious is that you grossly abused your position of trust. 'It is a blessing, albeit a small blessing, that children did not know they were abused in this way. Jailed: Ross was jailed at Basildon Crown Court and placed on the Sex Offenders Register for life . 'But the footage of them has been spread all over the internet thanks to your wretched and wicked behaviour.' The school where Ross carried out the filming cannot be named for legal reasons, but parents were informed of the teacher’s actions. Andrew Bagnall, mitigating, said: 'This will follow him for the rest of his life. 'He is very regretful and deeply ashamed. 'If he could turn back time and change what he has done, he would.' Ross admitted a charge of voyeurism, as well as three counts of making, possessing and distributing indecent images of children. He also pleaded guilty to two counts of possessing extreme pornography. The court heard that Ross had been fired from his job six months before his eventual arrest after turning up to work on a Monday morning having taken ecstasy. Staff became concerned about his erratic behaviour and Ross, of Station Avenue, Southend, was sent home for the safety of his pupils. He was then sacked after a General Teaching Council disciplinary hearing found him guilty of unacceptable professional conduct in January 2011. His depraved filming only came to light after he was no longer a teacher and pupils and his colleagues had no idea of what he had been doing. Sue Cook, Southend Council’s corporate director for children and learning, said: 'Naturally, everyone connected to the school was shocked and the past few months have been very difficult and challenging for the school community. 'Despite admitting a total of six offences, the indecent images of children do not feature any pupils from the Southend school and they were only affected by the voyeurism charge. 'However, quite properly, those safeguarding arrangements have been reviewed in light of what occurred to ensure that they are as rigorous and robust as they need to be. 'The school has offered support to its staff, parents and pupils throughout and will continue to do so.'","Matthew Ross hid camera under his t-shirt to film young boys .

Two million years ago, one of our distant ancestors lived on leaves and fruit from the trees in Africa. Scans of fossil teeth show the short and gangly South African Australopithecus sediba lived on a hard diet of trees, bushes and fruit two million years ago - similar to a chimpanzee. But virtually all other ancient human ancestors from Africa tucked into softer meals of grasses and sedges - even the 'Nutcracker Man', Paranthropus boisei, with his massive jaws and teeth. An analysis of the teeth of the short, gangly hominin australopithecus sediba shows it had a diet unlike virtually all of our other known ancestors . A. sediba had an upright posture and long arms, and embodied characteristics of both primitive and modern hominids - including a human-like ankle, short fingers and a long thumb for possible precision gripping and a relatively complex brain compared to earlier hominids. Researchers made the discovery by zapping fossilised teeth with a laser, which frees carbon from the enamel - allowing scientists to find the types of plants consumed and environments where the hominids lived. Although bark and woody tissues had not been documented as a dietary component of any other ancient African hominids before, these foods had been scoffed by many contemporary primates and contain both protein and soluble sugars. The diet of A. sediba also may have been similar to that of today's African savanna chimpanzees. The researchers also discovered microscopic, fossilised particles of plant tissue called phytoliths trapped in ancient tooth tartar - a hardened form of dental plague. University of Colorado Boulder doctoral student Paul Sandberg said: ‘The fact that these phytoliths are preserved in the teeth of 2-million-year-old hominids is remarkable and speaks to the amazing preservation at the site. Boning up on the facts: A right hand skeleton of Australopithecus sediba superimposed against a modern human hand . Remarkable find: One of two sets of bones from Australopithecus Sediba are unveiled at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg this week . Ancient: Scientists say the bones are 1.977million years old . ‘The phytolith data suggest the A. sediba individuals were avoiding the grasses growing in open grasslands that were abundant in the region at the time.‘It is an important finding because diet is one of the fundamental aspects of an animal, one that drives its behaviour and ecological niche. ‘As environments change over time because of shifting climates, animals are generally forced to either move or to adapt to their new surroundings. ‘What fascinates me is that these individuals are oddballs. I had pretty much convinced myself that after 4 million years ago most of our hominid kin had diets that were different from living apes, but now I am not so sure. ‘And while our sample is too small to be conclusive, the rate at which Malapa is spewing hominid fossils makes me reasonably certain we won't have to wait another two million years to augment our data set.’ The study was published by Nature. It was helped by the University of Arkansas, Johns Hopkins University, the Bloemfontein National Museum and the University of Witwatersrand, both in South Africa, and Texas A&M University.","Two-million-year-old South African had different diet to other pre-humans .

Jewellery collectors who don't mind if their gems have a shady past will soon get the chance to bid on a stash of valuables found in the home of reputed mobster Frank Calabrese Sr. Federal agents raided Calabrese's home in the Chicago suburb of Oak Brook two years ago and found a hoard of jewellery, guns and cash in a secret compartment behind a family portrait. Now, an online auction house in Texas plans to sell the items, which are valued at more than $500,000 and include more than 250 loose diamonds, earrings, engagement rings, luxury watches and other jewellery. Knives out: A hoard of jewellry, gold, and diamonds, as well as vintage pocket knives such as these will be sold by an online auction house after they were found at the home of reputed mobster Frank Calabrese Sr. Time to sell: This men's 18k Piaget wristwatch comes with a textured gold stick dial and integrated weave link bracelet .

During his trial, Calabrese bragged that he made millions on the street and was known among his family for stashing valuables. It isn't clear where Calabrese got all of the jewellery. Defence attorney Joseph Lopez described Calabrese - who accepted items in lieu of cash while doing business as a loan shark - as 'a collector.' Next month's auction is the second sale of items from Calabrese's home. Last year, Gaston & Sheehan sold more than 100 rare $500 and $1,000 bills from Calabrese's stash.

Make it clear: The Labour leader said no more deals should be signed until a review had been carried out to ensure the firm was fit to provide services . Ed Miliband called today for G4S to be blocked from getting new Government contracts in the wake of the Olympics security shambles. The Labour leader said no more deals should be signed until a review had been carried out to ensure the firm was fit to provide services. He also accused the coalition of opening the door to private companies carrying out core police roles. His attack came as Prime Minister David Cameron reiterated his vow to 'go after' G4S to make it repay the millions of pounds in extra costs incurred as a result of the fiasco. G4S has rarely been out of the . headlines since it admitted it had failed to employ enough staff . to fulfill their £284million contract obligations. As a result around . 3,500 troops have been parachuted in to help secure the Games as well as hundreds more police officers from forces around the country. 'People want bobbies on the beat, not G4S,' said Mr Miliband. 'We need to be much clearer about what private companies should and should not do.' The comments came as Mr Miliband launched Labour’s campaign for Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) elections in central London. He insisted it 'beggared belief' that G4S was trying to cling on to a £57 million management fee for Olympics security. But he refused to call for the immediate resignation of chief executive Nick Buckles, suggesting the Games needed stability. 'Clearly the company will have serious questions to answer about new leadership (after) the Olympic Games,' Mr Miliband said. Not happy: David Cameron vowed to 'go after' G4S to get it to repay millions of pounds over the Olympic security scandal yesterday . In a humiliating appearance before MPs earlier this week, Mr Buckles admitted there would be financial consequences from the company’s failure to recruit enough staff. But he dismissed the idea of giving up the multimillion-pound management charge. Mr Miliband said: 'I don’t think G4S should receive their £57 million management fee for services provided to the Olympic games. 'Frankly it beggars belief that they think they are entitled to it.' Under pressure: No10 sources said the Government 'will be very aggressive' in reclaiming funds from G4S. Its chief executive Nick Buckles, is pictured . There is speculation that a request may be made today for up to 2,000 additional troops to plug any further gaps in security if G4S’s problems become more severe. The Ministry of Defence, which has already upped its contribution by 3,500, said contingency plans were in place to increase the numbers again if necessary. G4S is already involved in £600 million of private work for the Home Office alone, and had been hoping to increase its share of the market. However, Mr Miliband said the security giant’s ambition must be put on hold. 'Before they are awarded any new policing contracts, we need a review of G4S’s ability to deliver,' he said. Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband have stressed that they expect the Games to be a major success despite the problems as the row continues to overshadow the final build-up. The Prime Minister has approved plans . to raise the number of military personnel deployed to protect the . Olympics to 19,000 – double the number of troops now fighting in . Afghanistan. No 10 sources . said the Government ‘will be very aggressive’ in reclaiming funds from . G4S. Sports minister Hugh Robertson said lawyers have been deployed to . trigger 'penalty clauses' in G4S's contract. Speaking during a visit to Afghanistan, Prime Minister David Cameron said: 'If a company doesn't fulfil its contracts, then that company should be gone after for that money and that's exactly what's going to happen in the case of G4S. Bright lights: A view of Hackney Wick as flood lights are tested at the Olympic stadium . 'I think it's very important that we allow them to try and carry out the role that they are contracted to deliver. 'But of course the Government's interest, the interest of the Olympic Games, the interest of everyone in our country is to make sure that whatever it is necessary to do to deliver a safe and secure and successful Games is done. 'We've always had contingency plans in place to deliver just that. We activate those contingency plans as and when necessary to do that. 'But I couldn't be clearer - we will do what is necessary and contracts that aren't fulfilled will have consequences, including pretty tough financial consequences. 'I think G4S, in apologising for their performance, have already made clear that they realise that fact.' Later, Jeremy Hunt sought to reassure Olympic ticket holders from around the world that the Games would be safe and secure. When asked at an Olympic Park press conference if yesterday's bomb attack on a bus full of Israeli holidaymakers in Bulgaria presented extra security challenges to the Games, the Culture Secretary replied: 'Obviously we're monitoring the whole time what's happening with respect to the changing security situation. 'We have extremely competent intelligence services who are giving us advice and we're responding to that on an ongoing basis. 'But the world can be absolutely certain that we will deliver a safe and secure Olympics. It's always been our number one priority.'

A Home Office-approved adviser and his wife who made more than £1million helping scores of immigrants illegally remain in Britain as part of a visa scam were jailed yesterday. When police raided the family home of Vijay and Bhawna Sorthia, they found bundles of cash totalling £330,000 hidden in a cupboard as well as documents relating to dozens of individuals they had unlawfully assisted. Mr Sorthia, 35, who ran immigration advisory service Migration Gurus from a small office in North West London, was yesterday imprisoned for 10 years for his part in the lucrative plot. Jailed: Home Office-approved immigration advisor Vijay Sorthia (left) and his wife Bhawana (right) have been jailed in relation to an immigration scam which made them more than £1million . He first came to Britain as a student in 2000, but then illegally gained a work permit in 2004 after claiming he was employed by a sham company. His 31-year-old wife, who said she worked as a cleaner at his office, was given a 15 month jail term for her 'subordinate role' in the scam. The pair, who are both Indian nationals and have three young children, will face deportation once their sentences have been served. As an accredited adviser with the Offices of the Immigration Services Commissioner (OISC), which is linked to the Home Office, Mr Sorthia was able to assist individuals with claims for asylum, as well as immigration, residence and citizenship applications. Notes: When police raided Vijay and Bhawna Sorthia's family home they found bundles of cash totalling £330,000 hidden in a cupboard as well as documents relating to dozens of individuals they had unlawfully helped . Evidence: The couple helped more than 160 clients illegally gain a visa by providing them with false documents alleging they were highly-skilled migrants, charging between £3,000 to £5,000 each time . In its advertising, Migration Gurus touted itself as 'a leading Immigration and Overseas Education consultancy' which had 'assisted hundreds of individuals' enter or remain in Britain. During an-18 month period between 2008 and 2010, the couple helped more than 160 clients illegally gain a visa by providing them with false documents alleging they were highly-skilled migrants. It is estimated they charged between £3,000 to £5,000 each time. But in reality, the individuals were already in Britain as foreign students, or migrant workers employed as low-skilled labour at supermarkets, betting shops or petrol stations, who would not have qualified for a new visa under the current immigration criteria. In a bid to bypass Home Office rules, the couple were using up to 70 sham companies to provide clients with payslips and wage payments which gave the appearance they were earning much larger sums, making them eligible to remain. Sentencing the couple at Isleworth Crown Court, Judge Andrew McDowall said Mr Sorthia’s actions risked 'undermining' Britain’s immigration controls and 'eroding public confidence' that migrants had arrived lawfully. Deception: In a bid to bypass Home Office rules, the couple were using up to 70 sham companies to provide clients with payslips and wage payments which gave the appearance they were earning much larger sums, making them eligible to remain . He warned: 'During difficult economic times, it becomes easier for those who are motivated by racial motives to start casting aspersions against those that are properly and legitimately in the country by trying to paint everyone of that ethnic group as tainted in some way, over the wrongdoings done by a limited number.' The court heard that following their arrest in May 2010 by investigators from the UK Border Agency, the couple sold their home in Stanmore, North West London, and transferred £466,000 out of the country, before fleeing to India on fraudulent passports. They returned to Britain in the July 2011, but only after taking a £21,000 holiday across the United States, stopping off in New York, the Grand Canyon, Atlanta, Louisiana and San Francisco. In total, the jury were told Mr Sorthia helped 166 people gain visas illegally over an 18-month period. But the real number of migrants who gained a visa unlawfully is likely to have run into the hundreds, with investigators dealing with the case estimating the criminal proceeds from the scam could have netted the pair up to £1.2million. Fifteen clients who benefitted from the scam have already been convicted and sentenced to between eight and 10 months in prison. Of these, 14 have already been deported. Senior UKBA investigating officer Robert Coxhead said: 'Vijay and Bhawna Sorthia knowingly flouted the UK’s immigration laws. 'They ran a sophisticated scam designed to help people who would otherwise have no right to be here stay in the UK. 'The amount of cash found at their home illustrates how lucrative this was, and we will now begin the process of stripping them of those assets using the Proceeds of Crime Act. 'The couple will also face deportation after they have served their sentences.' The pair were both found guilty of fraud charges and removing criminal property, while Mr Sorthia was also guilty of obtaining leave to remain by deception. A confiscation hearing to recover any money the couple made from the scam will take place later this year.","Vijay Sorthia jailed for ten years for his part in visa scam run from North West London .

A man injured in Anders Behring Breivik's devastating Oslo bomb blast today described the terrifying aftermath as blood pumped out of his arm and panic started to set in. Eivind Dahl Thoresen, 26, was hit by falling debris on the street outside the Norwegian government building in the July 22 explosion that killed eight. Face to face with Breivik at the latter's trial he said he only realised he was in trouble when, rushing to help another victim, he was told: 'Are you going to help me? Look at yourself.' Victim: Eivind Thoresen (centre) described the harrowing aftermath of the Oslo bomb blast . Killer: Breivik has admitted killing 77 people in the July 22 slaughter, but insists it was 'self-defence' With blood soaking through his jeans and T-shirt, he cried for help until two people arrived to bandage his wounds with clothes he was carrying in a bag. He said: 'I felt alternately cold and warm. At that point I was sure I would die.' Thoresen, who was hospitalised for three weeks after the blast so doctors could surgically remove shards from his arms and legs, still needs crutches to walk. His lawyer showed the court pictures of the grim scene. Blast: These CCTV images show the moment mass killer Anders Behring Breivik's car bomb exploded outside the Norwegian government building . Frightening: Eight people were killed in the July 22 blast . Following Thoresen's testimony, Breivik slammed a psychiatric report that declared him insane, insisting it was based on 'evil fabrications' meant to portray him as irrational and unintelligent. He said: 'It is not me who is described in that report'. A second psychiatric examination found that Breivik was sane. The five-judge panel trying Breivik on terror charges for the attacks will consider both reports. Breivik's mental state is the key issue that remains unresolved in the trial, since he has admitted to a bombing in Oslo's government district that killed eight people. He also confessed to a subsequent shooting massacre at a Labour Party youth camp that left 69 people dead, most of them teenagers. But he claims the attacks were 'necessary' and that the victims had betrayed Norway by embracing immigration. If found guilty and sane, Breivik would face 21 years in prison, though he can be held longer if deemed a danger to society. If declared insane, he would be committed to compulsory psychiatric care.

He said: 'To a political activist, the worst thing that can happen is to end up in a mental hospital. That would de-legitimise everything you stand for.' Breivik showed no remorse today as he listened to testimony describing the horrific injuries of the bombing victims, declaring instead if anyone should apologise it was the governing Labour Party. He said he had hoped they would change Norway's policy on immigration after his attacks. He added: 'But instead they continue in the same direction, so the grounds for struggle are unfortunately even more relevant now than before July 22.' Sounding irritated, the 33-year-old accused the two psychiatrists who declared him psychotic of deciding on the diagnosis prematurely, saying their judgment was clouded by their emotional response to the attacks. He said: 'They lack expertise in evaluating violent political activists.' He also criticised the second report on his mental health, by two other psychiatrists who found him 'narcissistic' and 'dissocial' but not criminally insane. Breivik claims to belong to an anti-Muslim militant group inspired by medieval crusaders and working with two other cells in Norway. Massacre: Police and rescuers recover the last remaining bodies from Utoya and the surrounding waters three days after the shootings on July 22 last year . Horrific memories: Mourners pay their respects next to flowers and Norwegian flags left in honour of those killed in the days after the killings . Investigators have said they don't believe the group exists, and prosecutor Svein Holden noted that the second psychiatric report described it as a 'fantasy'. 'It is a real network,' Breivik insisted, saying that police cannot conclude that the group doesn't exist just because they haven't found it. 'If you use that logic, then I didn't exist either before July 22,' Breivik said. 'I wouldn't want to be the police spokesman when the next attack happens in Norway. Because it will happen.' Fears were also raised again today that Breivik's trial is giving a public platform to a mass-murderer and could spawn copycat crimes by others who share his hatred of Muslims. 'There is a contagion effect that one has to take into consideration,' said Brigitte Nacos, a Columbia University professor who studies terrorism and the mass media. Col. Zbigniew Muszynski, the head of Poland's Counterterrorism Centre, said security experts believe there have already been violent acts inspired by Breivik, including an Italian extremist's killing of two African immigrants in Florence late last year. He said: 'There is always the potential danger that someone who hasn't been exposed to extremist propaganda could become interested in it and could undertake activity that is in violation of the law.' Describing the confusion following the blast, police chief Thor Langli said yesterday initial reports he received suggested there were two suspects, and two other bombs about to explode. When he heard about the Utoya shooting, he started thinking the bomb and the massacre were the actions of the same person. 'I thought there was a connection. But I didn't have any evidence for that,' Langli said. Turning to Breivik, he added: 'I could not imagine there being two people with so many crazy ideas.' The self-described militant nationalist testified last week that he had expected to be shot by police after the bombing. But no one stopped him as he walked to a getaway car parked near the bomb site, and he drove to Utoya. 'I estimated the chances of survival as less than 5 per cent,' Breivik said last Thursday. The trial is scheduled to go on until the end of June.","26-year-old hit by falling debris outside Norwegian government building .

An American deep sea treasure hunter claims he has found the body of Osama Bin Laden - and plans to visit the spot because he 'doesn't have enough proof' the Al Qaeda leader is really dead. Bill Warren, 60, claims to have found the exact spot in the Northern Arabian Sea where the terrorist leader was dumped into the ocean by U.S. forces after being killed in a raid one year ago. Mr Warren, who is now trying to raise over $200,000 for a mission to dive for Bin Laden's body bag, says the Al Qaeda leader is buried around 200 miles west of the Indian city of Surat. Deep sea diver: Mr Warren, who claims to have discovered over 200 shipwrecks, said Bin Laden's body is buried 200 miles west of Surat, India . He claims that as the Navy apparently weighed down Bin Laden's body when they gave him an ocean burial hours after his death, his corpse has not moved from its position on the ocean floor. Mr Warren, who says he has found more than 200 shipwrecks during his treasure hunting career, pinpointed the location after studying satellite images given to him by a source at the Pentagon. The marine explorer is aiming to start his mission towards Bin Laden's body at the start of June, and that he may be able to find the body in 'under a week'. Mr Warren told Spanish newspaper El Mundo his search could also take up to three months, and that his biggest fear is being killed or sunk by the U.S. government. He said: 'I've located where it was thrown. I'm the only one with this information. It's 200 miles to the west of the Indian city of Surat. On the hunt: Bill Warren claims to have found the exact spot where Bin Laden is buried at sea, and plans to head there next month . Buried at sea: U.S. Forces buried Bin Laden in the North Arabian Sea by dumping his body from the USS Carl Vinson . U.S. forces dumped Bin Laden at sea to prevent his Pakistan compound in Abbottabad becoming a shrine . 'He's at the bottom of the ocean and the soldiers put weights on him.' Mr Warren had announced his plans to search for the location last June, a year after Bin Laden was killed by U.S. Navy Seals during a raid on his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. The explorer told TMZ at the time he 'dosn't trust the government' of President Obama that the remains are actually those of the Taliban leader. Bin Laden was disposed of overboard the USS Carl Vinson in the North Arabian sea following DNA tests, but Mr Warren remains unconvinced and wants to conduct the DNA tests himself. The warship received a SEAL team that carried Bin Laden's body after killing him in a raid on his walled compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. His body was placed in a 'weighted bag', an officer made religious remarks and he was put on a flat board and tipped into the sea, the Pentagon said. Assassinated: Bin Laden was shot dead by U.S. Navy Seals in May last year . Mr Warren began diving commercially in 1972 and has ran several salvage companies since then, according to his website. The treasure hunter is currently in Afghanistan, on what he says is a contract with the nation's government to explore the Caspian Sea for shipwrecks. He said at the time: 'We do this because we are patriotic Americans and feel that President Obama failed to provide the proof.' The exact location of Bin Laden's body has never been revealed, partly to prevent the area becoming a shrine for Islamic extremists.","Bill Warren claims Al Qaeda mastermind is buried in Arabian Sea 200 miles west of Surat .

A hunt for two missing fishermen was called off today as rescue teams found their stricken vessel and its liferaft on the sea bed. Coastguards had been searching since Thursday for Robert Prowse, 23, and Jack Craig, 22, who went missing while at sea. The body of their skipper David McFarlane, 35, was found yesterday. Scroll down to see a video of the ship being rescued last year . Fifty-year-old ship the Purbeck Isle DH104, which disappeared in choppy seas off the coast of Bournemouth yesterday with three men on board . The survey ship Odyssey Explorer discovered the wreck of their 35ft-long boat the Purbeck Isle lying 10 miles off Portland, in Dorset, at a depth of 50 metres. The vessel was reported missing on Thursday evening. Desperate efforts to find his two companions continued amid hopes Mr Prowse and Mr Craig could have taken to the liferaft of the boat when they ran into difficulty. But these were dashed when the raft was discovered on board the wreck at 11am today. Portland Coastguard's Rescue Co-ordination Centre manager Mark Rodaway said: 'After a prolonged and extensive three-day search, sadly, the time has now passed when we could have hoped that the two remaining crew members from the Purbeck Isle would be found alive. 'Our final area of investigation was to search for the missing liferaft in the hope that they had been able to board it before the vessel sank, but sadly this new information means that this search will now be terminated. 'Our thoughts are with the families of all three crewmen at this difficult time.' The 36ft wooden vessel - discovered by a survey ship lying ten miles off the Dorset coast - is thought to have broken up suddenly and sunk after getting swamped by choppy seas off Portland Bill. The 50-year-old boat, the Purbeck Isle DH104, disappeared so quickly that the three men didn’t have the chance to put out a Mayday alert. The same boat was involved in two incidents last year, once in June when the skipper lost two fingers and was airlifted to hospital. The other was in January last year when the boat began to take on water and had to be towed to safety by the RNLI. The three men on board were named locally as captain David MacFarlane, 36, and the two crew members as Robert Prowse, 22, and Jack Craig, also in his twenties . HMS York, the Type-42 destroyer which is part of the major search operation for the remaining missing fishermen . According to locals they crew had been 'whelking' and had been moving equipment from one place to another. A major air and sea search had been launched involving three navy warships; the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Wave Ruler, and HMS York, a type 42 Destroyer, and one American Navy supply vessel, the 2nd Lt John P Bobo, to search for the men.

Coastguards repeatedly tried to contact the crew over the VHF radio but were met with silence. The search for the men had previously been called off at night 2am and hopes of finding the remaining fishermen alive are now rapidly fading following the discovery of the wreckage. Mother of missing fisherman Mr Prowse said she was alerted at midnight to the fact her son was missing. Maxine Prowse, 45, lives in Plymouth where she is a full-time carer to her other son, Peter. Her son Mr Prowse has three children, all aged under five. Through sobs, his mother said: 'I didn't know until midnight when his dad rang me. 'I'm just listening to the news now and waiting. I haven't seen him in the last couple of years because I moved to Plymouth. 'But he's a hard-working lad, he's always down on the harbour in the summer crabbing and getting holiday maker to do it too. He has a lot of friends.' Ocean: A map released by Swanage Coastguard shows the ongoing search operation south of Portland Bill near Weymouth in Dorset . Rob Brown, a local skipper, said no one knew what had happened but working with pots could be dangerous. He said: 'If you are pulling in pots and one gets stuck and it can pull the boat down and then if a wave hits you and everyone is on deck there might not be time to raise the alarm.' Dave Pitman, another skipper, said: 'They were working with whelking pots as I understand it. 'They were moving the gear from one place to another which is a normal operation. We just all hope they are safe.' Andy Alcock, the secretary of the Weymouth and Portland Fishermen and Licensed Boatmen Association, said: 'There was a life raft on board and there is a chance the men are in that and have been blown up and down the Channel and are awaiting rescue.' The sea conditions for yesterday were said to have been reasonable, although the sea swell built up to a choppy state by the afternoon. Fred Caygill, a spokesman for Portland coastguard which is co-ordinating the operation, said: 'The boat went out yesterday morning and was seen leaving the harbour at 8.30am. 'We received a call at 5.40pm from a fisherman who was concerned about the Purbeck Isle. The vessel’s buyers who had been waiting back at port had been unable to make contact with the men for a while. 'We commenced a major air and sea search for the Purbeck Isle but with no specific location we went over its usual fishing grounds which are up to six miles off Portland Bill. 'We have tried to make contact with the vessel over the VHF radio but received nothing back. 'We also made VHF broadcasts to alert other vessels of the search and also to request any vessels that could assist in the search. We are in touch with the men’s families and the police. 'We obviously live in hope of finding the men and we will continue with this search and keep going for the best part of today.'

If the court comes to the same conclusion when it issues its ruling, Anders Breivik would avoid criminal responsibility for Norway's worst peacetime massacre . Mass killer Anders Breivik should be sent to a psychiatric hospital instead of jail, prosecutors said yesterday. The 33-year-old Norwegian murdered 77 people in a shooting and bomb rampage last July. However prosecutor Svein Holden said there were enough doubts about his sanity to make it impossible to send him to prison. The defence is likely to reject  the insanity finding today, the last day of the ten-week trial. Two teams of psychiatrists reached opposite conclusions about Breivik’s mental health after his attacks on a government building and a youth summer camp. One team diagnosed him with ‘paranoid schizophrenia’, a serious mental illness which would preclude a prison sentence. The second team found him sane, saying he suffers from a narcissistic personality disorder. Breivik claims he is sane and his attacks were motivated by his far-Right views. 'We request that he is transferred to compulsory psychiatric care,' prosecutor Svein Holden told the court in closing arguments. Though there was conclusive evidence that Breivik was psychotic during the July 22 attacks, there were enough doubts about his sanity that he cannot be sentenced to prison under Norwegian law, Holden said. Just like when the trial stared in mid-April, the 33-year-old Norwegian flashed a clenched-fist salute with his right arm before he was led out of the court today. Earlier in the trial, Breivik said the psychiatric dimension of the case was a way for Norwegian authorities to ridicule him and divert attention from his ideology. Closing arguments: Prosecutors Svein Holden, left, and Inga Bejer Engh, right,  said there was conclusive evidence that Breivik was psychotic during the attacks . Grim: Earlier in the trial Breivik said the psychiatric dimension of the case was a way for authorities to ridicule him and divert attention from his ideology . Breivik claims Norway and Europe are being colonised by Muslims, who make up about 2 per cent of Norway's population. He has said he selected his targets - a government high-rise and a summer camp for the governing Labor Party's youth organisation - to strike against the political forces he claims betrayed the country with liberal immigration policies. Horror: Seventy-seven people died in the attacks at Norway's government headquarters and a youth summer camp on the island of Utoya in July last year . Prosecutors said one of the key challenges to Breivik's sanity was his insistence of belonging to a militant anti-Muslim modeled after the Knights Templar, a Christian military order during the crusades, even though investigators have found no trace of the network. Though Breivik tried to tone down the significance of the network during the trial, he maintained that it exists and that there are two other cells in Norway.","If court favours prosecution killer would avoid criminal responsibility for Norway's .

Boris Johnson has been blasted by road safety campaigners after claiming two-thirds of cyclists killed or seriously injured in London caused the crashes by breaking the laws of the road. Mr Johnson told his first Mayor's Question Time cyclists were to blame for 62 per cent of serious accident involving bikes - claiming too many riders ignored traffic laws. The mayor, who described himself as a 'passionate, militant cyclist', faces accusations of hypocrisy, four years after he was caught on video cycling without a helmet along a pavement and through two red lights. Bike-lover: Boris Johnson has angered cyclists after claiming they're to blame for serious crashes. The mayor, left, pictured riding through a red light back in 2008 . During Question Time this week, the mayor said: 'The increase in cycling has not necessarily been accompanied by an increase (in) observance of the rules of the road. 'It is very important, I think people should be aware of the high proportion. I have seen a figure of I think 62 per cent... of cyclist KSIs (people killed and seriously injured) are associated with some infraction by the cyclist themselves of the rules of the road. That is very sad.' Kate Cairms, whose sister Eilidh was killed by a lorry in 2009, said Mr Johnson's comments were dangerous and risked pitting cyclists and drivers against each other. 'He has done a lot of harm to cyclists because he has upped the ante between cyclists and drivers when we need to be upping the level of mutual respect,' she told The Independent. 'It is tarring people with the same brush. There are cyclists who jump red lights so people say they all do. But there are also bad drivers and that doesn't lead us to say everyone is bad.' Accidents: A fellow pedaller takes a tumble at the launch of the mayor's 'Boris Bikes' scheme . Other critics have queried the source of the mayor's figures - pointing to a 2009 report from the independent Transport Research Laboratory which showed that motorists were entirely at fault for between 64 and 70 per cent of accidents involving adults over 25. A spokesperson for the Mayor of London said: 'When attending a recent Mayoral hustings event the Mayor was told that figures indicated a high proportion of cyclists killed or seriously injured were either committing an offence or in the process of doing so. 'He has asked his team to look into whether that statistic can be confirmed as part of getting the most accurate assessment to tackle the issue successfully.' In 2008 Mr Johnson was forced to backtrack after the Sunday Mirror caught him on film breaking a number of traffic laws as he rode to work at City Hall. His spokesman said at the time: 'Boris feels strongly thatcyclists should not jump red lights and if he did so then clearlythat was a mistake and he will be more careful in thefuture.'","Boris claims 63 per cent of cyclists killed or seriously hurt broke laws of the road .

Four activists were arrested today after scaling the gates of Buckingham Palace and chaining themselves to the railings. Three men and one woman from the Climate Siren group locked themselves to the south centre gate just after 2pm, holding megaphones and wearing T-shirts that read: 'Climate emergency. 10% annual emission cuts'. Two held a banner carrying a quote from the Prince of Wales reading: 'The doomsday clock of climate change is ticking ever faster towards midnight. We are simply not reacting quickly enough.' Royal demand: Crowds gather as protesters chain themselves to the south centre gate to highlight the failure to reach international agreements on tackling global warming following the end of the Rio+20 conference . Guess where I am, Mum? A protester chained to the gates with a banner makes a call on his mobile phone . The four were removed by police using a cherry-picker more than four hours later as officers brought the protest to an end. They were detained at various central London police stations on suspicion of breaching Royal Parks regulations. Other activists wearing T-shirts and carrying banners with the same message were also on the scene. The group said they were calling on the Queen to follow her son's example in speaking out about 'the escalating threat of catastrophic climate change'. Inspiration: The demonstrators displayed a quote by Prince Charles on the subject of climate change . The protest came the day after the Rio+20 global conference on sustainable development in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, came to a close. The group described their actions as 'an act of civil disobedience designed to demand urgent, concerted and meaningful action to tackle the unprecedented national and global emergency presented by the catastrophic destabilisation of global climate and timed for the day after the end of the Rio+20 Earth Summit in Brazil.' They said they were protesting over 'the failure of the conference to achieve any meaningful results'. In an open letter to the Queen posted on their website, Climate Siren said they wanted to see an 'upscaling of our national effort to confront the emergency'. 'Civil disobedience': Police guarded the gates of the Palace while the activists demanded change . They said they had chosen the Palace as their location to emphasise that the issue was of 'critical importance for our national destiny' as well as for the future of the entire global community. The letter read: 'We are calling for our nation to take strenuous, positive action both to fulfil our responsibilities as a major emitter of greenhouse gases, now and historically, and to show courage and resolution in taking a lead on the issue. 'We echo the sentiments of your son and heir, HRH the Prince of Wales... 'But we are going further because such sentiments are in danger of becoming mere platitudes if not accompanied by concrete proposals for action.' Red letter day: Armed with T-shirts, banners and megaphones, 'Climate siren' locked themselves to the gate just after 2pm . They told the Queen she was from a generation that can remember 'another great national struggle' and wrote: 'We believe that our national security is at stake now, no less than it was during the dark days of the last Great War, albeit in a very different way. 'As you celebrate this year's Jubilee you must find it impossible not to view with consternation the dark clouds that once again are gathering to threaten the future of this island, with which your name has been so closely associated these last 60 years. 'These are the dark clouds of what looks increasingly likely to be a much greater global tragedy than the last World War. 'It is time to act - with boldness, resolution and determination - not the kind of half-hearted half-measures that we have seen up to now. Kings for a day: The aim of the protest was to highlight the failure of the conference to reach international agreements on reducing global warming . 'It is time that you and all public figures with influence followed the example of your son by speaking up loudly, clearly, and unceasingly, about the escalating threat of catastrophic climate change.' A hundred or so bystanders stood and watched the protest. Activist Siobhan Grimes, 24, from Bethnal Green in east London, who was among those at the scene, said: 'Our politicians aren't doing enough. We're hoping to inspire people to wake up to the consequences of catastrophic climate change.' A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'At approximately 2.05pm on Saturday June 23, four protesters - three men and one woman - climbed the centre gate and south centre gate at Buckingham Palace and secured themselves to the railings with chains.

A man who went to prison for violent disorder has been freed by appeal judges after they ruled that he was trying to protect his dying brother. Isbar Ellahi, 31, from Stoke-on-Trent, spent nearly eight months in jail for 'brawling' with a gang of youths whose attack led to the death of his brother, Israr. Three senior judges at London’s Court of Appeal today released Isbar after ruling he should never have been jailed. Three top judges at the Court of Appeal said Isbar should never have been jailed . Speaking outside court, Mr Ellahi’s sister, Shakila, said: 'This was a clear miscarriage of justice and I am relieved that we can start grieving for Israr. 'I am angry at the Crown Prosecution Service and the police who charged my brother. 'The system has gone badly wrong here and I am relieved he has been released today. There are no words that can account for what my family and I have gone through.' Lord Justice Hooper told the court 30-year-old Israr was confronted by a gang of up to 15 white youths in June 2010, shortly after a racist attack on Tiger Bites takeway in Stoke. His brother Isbar and friend Mohammed Shafiq, 30, were passing in a car and got out in a bid to help him. As they went to Israr’s aid he was punched to the ground, causing injuries from which the father-of-three tragically died 12 days later, the judge said. A charge of manslaughter against one of the gang was later dropped due to lack of evidence, and Isbar and Shafiq were controversially accused of violent disorder, which they later admitted, the court heard. At Stoke Crown Court in November last year, both men received longer sentences than those who initiated the violence, with Isbar handed a three-and-a-half year jail term and Shafiq jailed for three years. Four others were given sentences of up to two years and nine months after they admitted violent disorder. Two of them also pleaded guilty to affray. Appealing today, Simon Farrell QC, for Isbar, said: 'There is a sense from the family and the appellant that he should never have pleaded guilty to this. It is truly a tragic case.' Israr was confronted by a gang of up to 15 white youths in June 2010, shortly after a racist attack on Tiger Bites takeaway in Roundwell Street Stoke . Shafiq’s lawyer, Balbir Singh, added: 'The judge had no regard at all to the fact that the brother of one of appellants died, and the very good friend of the other. 'It is of great concern to them that they were unable to do more to help the man who they got out of the car to protect. It was not necessary to send those men to custody.' He told the court Shafiq’s nine-year-old niece sadly died from cancer while he was inside, and it was a source of 'great distress' to him that he was not around to comfort his family. Lord Justice Hooper, sitting with Mr Justice Hamblen and Mrs Justice Thirlwall, ruled that suspended sentences were the most the two men should have faced and cut both prison terms to allow their release. The judge said: 'It is not easily clear to determine why the two appellants pleaded guilty. They appear to have accepted that, having started effecting some lawful violence in defence of Israr, they went beyond that which they ought to have done. 'Whilst accepting that this court is loathe to interfere with a trial judge’s assessment of culpability, we take the view that the judge seriously over-estimated and over-categorised the culpability of these two appellants. 'We take the view that, if there was to be custodial sentences at all, it would have been a short one that would have been suspended. However, they have now been in custody since November and have served a significant time in prison. 'Doing the best that we can do by passing a sentence which ensures their immediate release, but accepting that the sentence we would have passed would have been shorter, we substitute a sentence of nine months.' Outside court, Miss Ellahi added: 'It is clear from the judge’s remarks today that he should not have been charged. He was grief-ridden and frightened when he pleaded guilty.'","Isbar Ellahi was set upon by a gang of white youths who had just attacked a takeaway shop .

A new range of antidepressants aimed at pets with behavioural problems could become available in the UK later this year. Prozac-style drugs would help benefit 80 per cent of Britain's eight million dogs, according to a new study. The research has found that the idiosyncrasies of man’s best friend, such as chasing their tail relentlessly and barking at the door even if nobody is there, are often born from psychological problems such as anxiety and phobic behaviour. Problems: Dogs who bark at the door when there is noone there were among those said to possibly have behavioural conditions . The research found that eight out of ten dogs are now suffering from a range of behavioural conditions, including obsessive compulsive disorder. The study found that vets are increasingly treating dogs for a range of conditions, such as anorexia, depression, sleeping problems and even ‘self-mutilation’. Scientists also warned that other household pets such as rabbits, cats and parrots, were beginning to suffer from similar behavioural problems. But critics have warned that labelling pets with such conditions and introducing Prozac-style drugs may simply be offering excuses for bad ownership. Hyperactivity was the most prevalent problem among dogs, with 60 per cent of animals suffering from the condition. It was found that 22.5 displayed traits associated with obsessive compulsive disorder, responsible for behaviours such as tail-chasing and excessive paw-licking. A further 30 per cent of animals were also found to have ‘phobias’ or ‘fears’, while 12 per cent were found to have ‘separation-related problems’ when parted with their owner. The scientist who conducted the study claimed that millions of dogs were suffering from psychological conditions. Dr Claire Corridan collected responses from more than 1,300 dog-owners who observed their pets over a two-week period. Dr Corridan, who belongs to the Companion Animal Behaviour Therapy Study Group, an affiliate of the British Small Animal Veterinary Association, said the problems were partly due to owners spending less time with their pets. She said: ‘We are seeing more and more behaviour problems in our companion animals. We all have busy lifestyles, so quite often cats and dogs are spending less time with their owners and less time being socialised. ‘It’s now not such a big deal to say you are going to see a pet psychiatrist or behaviour counsellor.’ The leading vet said that relying on drugs to treat the problems could be dangerous and may not address the causes of behavioural issues in pets. Critics have warned that labelling pets with such conditions and introducing Prozac-style drugs may simply be offering excuses for bad ownership. Two behavioural drugs for animals already exist in the UK and a new product made by Prozac-developers Eli Lilly, is expected to be licensed later this year. Beverley Cuddy, editor of Dogs Today, warned against ‘medicalising’ the behaviour of animals. She said: ‘Maybe people are becoming a bit more perfectionist and want their dogs free of all negatives. But this means you are not tolerating normal doggy behaviour. There are lots of things you would prefer your dog not to do, but that is part of having a pet. She added: ‘Also, if you medicalise your animal’s problem, it removes a bit of guilt and responsibility from the owner. You can say your dog is not a thug, he has a condition.’","Vets now treating dogs for anorexia, depression, sleeping problems and even 'self mutilation'

A convicted sex offender was arrested yesterday and charged with the cold case murder of a 19-year-old law firm worker who was stabbed to death on New Year’s Eve in 1987. Edwin Alcaide, 53, was arrested after the NYPD Cold Case Squad matched his DNA to tissue samples they recovered from under the fingernails of victim Lisette Torres. Alcaide, who lives in Manhattan’s East Village, has a long string of convictions and a violent past - including charges of drug dealing, rape, robbery, and attempted murder. Scroll down for video . Cold case: Lissette Torres, a 19-year-old law firm worker from Brooklyn, was brutally murdered on New Year's Eve in 1987 . On New Year’s Eve a quarter of a century ago Miss Torres, a resident of Sunset Park in Brooklyn, was fighting for her life. Earlier that night, she had called her mother, saying she was on her way to her family’s annual New Year’s Eve celebrations. But Miss Torres never made it to the party. She lost the struggle with her . attacker, and was found stabbed to death in an auto lot under the . Gowanus Expressway on New Year’s Day, still wearing her white coat and . boots. Arrested: Convicted sex offender Edwin Alcaide was caught thanks to a hit on DNA data . Her best friend, Lizzette Sierra, who saw her body in the morgue later called it ‘pretty bad,’ telling the New York Times in 2010: ‘It seemed like her upper torso, face and hands were cut up. I know she struggled. She was not intimidated easily.’ The New York Post wrote in 2010 that Miss Torres was a recent graduate of Our Lady of Perpetual Help High School, and worked at a law firm. Friends described her as happy and bright, and said she was planning to attend college. Police resumed their investigation two years ago, and pressure was on to find her killer. NYPD officers began posting flyers with the image of the dark-haired woman with striking features, hoping that someone would be able to provide insight into her brutal murder. In 1987, the borough – like the rest of New York – was racked with violent crime. According to the Times, Ms Torres was one of at least ten people killed on January 1, 1987. More than 2,000 homicides were recorded in the city that year alone. In 2011, there were 490 recorded homicides in New York; the year before, there were 519. According to ABC7, Alcaide’s multiple convictions were enough to put him behind bars several times, but it was a 1998 charge of first degree sexual abuse that led police to take a sample of his DNA. A miracle: Ms Torres' parents, Jose and Rosa, said the arrest of Alcaide is the moment for which they've been praying for 25 years . Hearth and home: The Torreses still live in their home in Sunset Park, Brooklyn; they said that they did not decorate their house for Christmas until four years ago . The network said that he sexually abused an eight-year-old child while he was babysitting. Miss Torres’ family has spent the past 25 years on tenterhooks, waiting for any indicator that authorities were a step closer to finding their daughter’s killer. Inside the family’s home, Lissette's graduation picture hangs prominently. Mr Torres, who retired in 2010 from his maintenance job at Long Island College Hospital, said it had remained untouched. ‘It’s always there; it’s never been moved,’ he said, adding that the family only began decorating their home for Christmas in 2008. He told the Times that he, along with his wife Rosa, travel to Staten Island every New Year’s Eve to place flowers on their daughter’s grave. They also visit her every month. Perp walk: Alcaide is seen Thursday being taken into police custody; he was charged with second-degree murder . Running labs: DNA collected from under Ms Torres' fingernails matched with Alcaide's, which was in the system from a 1998 sex offender database . Alcaide, who was charged with second-degree murder, is now waiting to be arraigned in Brooklyn Criminal Court. A source told the Post that he was an acquaintance of Miss Torres, though it is not clear what the motivation for murder could have been. Rose and Jose Torres said Thursday that news of the arrest was the miracle for which they had been waiting a quarter of a century. Rosa told CBS New York: ‘I’m happy now. I waiting 25 year for this moments, you know [sic].’ They plan to be at his arraignment today, they told the news station.

South Korea has been condemned by environmental groups and the international community after revealing plans to resume whale hunting for research purposes. The Asian nation has informed the International Whaling Commission of its plans, after claiming it wants to resume whaling to help study the types and amount of fish whales eat. But critics believe these plans are a back-door effort to make the country only the fourth world nation to allow commercial whaling since an international ban came into force in 1986. Scroll down for video . 'Research': Japanese workers whale hunting in 2005. South Korea claims its whale hunting will also be for 'scientific purposes' Korean officials said the whaling would be aimed only at studying the types and amounts of fish whales eat, as fishermen complain an increasing number of whales are consuming large amounts of fish stocks. The IWC gives member states sovereign rights to scientific whaling but South Korea will still give up its whaling plans if the international organisation rejects them, officials said. Various exceptions have allowed Japan, Iceland and Norway to hunt whales anyway. Indigenous groups in several countries also whale as allowed under international rules. Japan claims its hunts are for research purposes, though the meat from the killed whales mostly ends up in restaurants, stores and school lunches. The . IWC moratorium on whaling introduced in 1986 permits lethal research on . whales, with the meat then allowed to be used for consumption. This . loophole is already widely used by Japan. Other loopholes in the ruling also allow Iceland and Norway to hunt whales anyway. Before the ban in 1986, South Korea claimed it caught about 600 whales a year, and that most of the meat was consumed. However, recent records have shown the Asian market for whale meat may not be as lucrative as officials thought. A 2006 survey found that 95% of Japanese people rarely or never eat whale meat. This . comes despite campaigners claiming Japanese whalers used 2.28million . Yen (£19m/US$30m) from its earthquake recovery fund to subsidise an . Antarctic whale hunt last year. Whaling . is now subject to prosecution and punishable by a jail or fines, but . meat is available from mostly minke that get caught in fishing nets 'by . accident' or wash ashore. South Korean officials said they have not decided what to do with the whale meat following the studies. The leaders of Australia and New Zealand quickly condemned South Korea's plans and said they would raise diplomatic protests. 'We think it would be a terrible step in the wrong direction,' New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said during a visit to Sydney. Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard told a news conference that she was 'very disappointed' at the South Korean announcement. 'We are completely opposed to whaling, there's no excuse for scientific whaling,' she said. 'We believe this move is a thinly veiled attempt by Korea to conduct commercial whaling under the guise of scientific research, similar to hunts conducted by Japan in the Southern Ocean whale sanctuary,' said Wendy Elliott, head of global environmental group WWF's delegation to IWC. Speaking at an IWC meeting today in Panama City, Prime Minister Gillard added: 'We will make our voices heard today. 'Our ambassador will speak to counterparts in South Korea at the highest levels of the South Korea government and indicate Australia's opposition to this decision.' Opposition: Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard said her country would 'make their voices heard' in opposing South Korea's claim to whale hunting . Furious: Activists attended the IWC meeting in Panama City to demand a South Atlantic whale sanctuary to protect the creatures . Australia has filed a complaint against Japan at the International Court of Justice in The Hague to stop scientific whaling. A decision is expected in 2013 or later. New Zealand Foreign Minister Murray McCully said the announcement was a setback to global conservation efforts as whales in its waters were already targeted by Japan. 'The portrayal of this initiative as a 'scientific' program will have no more credibility than the so-called scientific program conducted by Japan, which has long been recognized as commercial whaling in drag,' he said in a statement.","Commercial whaling has been under international ban since 1986 .

Its operations affect the global price of zinc, steel, copper, oil and a number of agricultural products including grains oil seeds, cotton and sugar. The firm employs about 57,000 people and turned over $145billion last year. It has assets worth in excess of $79billion . It plans to takeover Xstrata this year, which if successful will be the biggest mining buyout in history. Its £4bn takeover of grain supplier Viterra will see it control of most of Western Canada's and south Australia's grain storage. However, Ms Calpe says hopes that the multimillion dollar company will discontinue trading in potential starvation and hunger in developing nations for ethical motivations would not be realised. She added: 'Now is the time to change the rules and regulations about how Glencore and other multinationals such as ADM and Monsanto operate. 'They know this and have been lobbying heavily around the world to water down and halt any reform.' Last month food prices rose by an average of six per cent globally and Oxfam has strongly condemned the lines being taken by major food traders such as Glencore. Jodie Thorpe said: 'Glencore's comments that 'high prices and lots of volatility and dislocation' was 'good' gives us a rare glimpse into the little-known world of companies that dominate the global food system.' She Glencore was 'profiting from the misery and suffering of poor people who are worst hit by high and volatile food prices.' The drought in the U.S., the world leader in food trading, is so severe that G20 nations are contemplating holding an emergency summit. Aid agencies, the United Nations and the British Government have all attacked the Glencore director Chris Mahoney whose comments come after a drought has devastated almost half the U.S. corn crop. The last severe food crisis, in 2008, sparked riots in cities around the globe. The United Nations food agency warned this month that there is risk of such a situation developing again. The UK is also concerned about the food crisis situation. Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for International Development Stephen O'Brien said: 'We know that food-price spikes hit the poorest hardest. 'Ensuring the poor can still access enough food is vital in times of food-price rises which is why the UK is investing in safety nets that deliver food and cash to the poorest.' A Glencore spokesperson said: 'Regardless of the macro-economic environment, Glencore helps fulfil global demand by getting the commodities that are needed to the places that need them most. 'Our agricultural operations are spread across farms, silos, crushing plants and port facilities. 'Alongside our construction of much needed logistics and processing infrastructure to meet growing demand, Glencore works to support supply and aid the efficient flow of agricultural commodities around the world.'","U.S. enduring worst drought in decades .

Tragedy: Six-year-old Sierra Newbold's death has been ruled a homicide with an autopsy determining she had also been sexually assaulted . Police continue to search for the killer of six-year-old Sierra Newbold - and they think he might have been caught on film abducting the girl from her home. Officials revealed on Thursday that a surveillance camera at the Newbolds' house in West Jordan, Utah captured images from around the time of her disappearance on Tuesday morning. While police would not elaborate on what the footage shows, it could provide a vital clue to investigators hunting for the person who sexually assaulted Sierra before killing her and dumping her body in a canal. So far there is no confirmed suspect after three days of searching, although police have said they cannot rule anyone out of their investigation - including the girl's family. Authorities have warned Salt Lake City residents to be vigilant for a sexual predator, after an autopsy report revealed Sierra had been sexually assaulted. West Jordan Police Chief Doug Diamond cautioned parents to be on the lookout. ‘There is obviously a predator out there that is a monster, that has murdered a child,’ he said. Little Sierra was discovered one hour after her mother reported her missing in the suburb of West Jordan and following an autopsy report it was confirmed she had been sexually assaulted. 'Our highest priority now is to identify, arrest, and successfully prosecute the person or persons responsible for this crime,' said Diamond . 'I share in the concern of our residents for the ongoing safety and security of our children.' Scroll down for video . Young life: Pictured, right, in the arms of her mother and beside her other sisters, Sierra played on her local soccer team and had just graduated kindergarten according to family . Child's life: Sierra was described by family as outgoing, eager to make friends, and a young girl who loved to dance and draw . The chief said he has increased police patrols in the area and is asking parents to take precautions to protect their children. 'If . during the course of this investigation an imminent threat becomes . known, we will share that information with our residents immediately,' he said. Diamond said the girl’s parents have been cooperating in the investigation. Officers found Sierra’s body in the canal about a block from her home, just 30 minutes after her mother 'discovered she was not there and called us,' police Sgt. Drew Sanders said. Sanders declined to comment on any possible motive in the case. Investigators also are withholding a precise chain of events leading to the girl’s disappearance. 'We haven’t come to any conclusion,' Sanders said. He said police have 'tons of leads' and 'it’s paramount we find out who did this.' Crime scene: The child's body was found in this four-foot-deep irrigation canal near her home about 30 minutes after her mother reported her missing . Homicide: Signs of foul play to the girl's body were not reported prior to the autopsy results released on Wednesday . Police . have said there were no signs of a break-in at the family’s home, and . they declined to release any more details about the case. 'We don't have any idea' how Sierra . disappeared or whether she was taken from the bedroom, her grandfather Reed Newbold said. 'It's a complete mystery.' The . parents 'are devastated by this,' he added. Tragic morning: Sierra is pictured on the shoulders of her father, who had already left for work when she went missing . Reed . Newbold said the family isn't suspected of being involved in the girl's . disappearance with them having been fully cooperative with . investigators. Surveillance . footage taken of the area surrounding the girl's home is currently . under investigation. 'Our contacts at the FBI have been . helping us with that. They’ve been working on enhancing that . [surveillance video],' Mr Sanders told Fox 13. 'Right now, we do know that there are images on there and our investigators are analyzing that and trying to determine what use those are and if any evidence exists,' he said. He declined to say how long Sierra had been dead before discovered by police and if the autopsy was able to collect any DNA evidence, so as to not jeopardize their investigation, according to the Salt Lake City Tribune. Mr Sanders also declined to comment on any possible suspects or a motive in the case. 'We haven't come to any conclusion,' said Mr Sanders. He said police have 'tons of leads' and 'it's paramount we find out who did this.' The girl's dad had left for work some . time before her absence was noticed but her mother. Her younger sister and . elder brother were also at home. According to West Jordan Police Chief Doug Diamond on Tuesday, 'there was not a significant amount of trauma on the body,' he said speaking to the Tribune, leading to them being initially uncertain of whether foul play had occurred or not. Mr Sanders dismissed a neighborhood rumor on Wednesday that the girl's disappearance was connected to a weekend grass fire that gutted two houses and drew onlookers to the girl's neighborhood. Reed Newbold said the onlookers possibly widen the field of suspects. However, police determined the house fires were 'completely unrelated' to the girl's disappearance, Mr Sanders said. Without a trace: The girl's mother, pictured left with her husband, Sierra and other daughter, reported her missing from her bedroom in the early hours of Tuesday without any sign of a forced entry into their home . Sister act: Sierra's sister Taylor was said to be the six-year-old's best friend whom she did everything with. The two pictured together .

School: Sierra's family said the girl was looking forward to starting the first grade at West Jordan Elementary . The West Jordan community, where two houses burned to the ground on Saturday after a tree fell on a power line, was mourning the death of the young girl as well. Neighbour, Claire Evenson, whose daughter was a school friend of Sierra, told Deseret News residents were struggling to come to terms with the sudden loss. She described the girl as smart and full of life and said she loved to dance and play dress up. 'She was going to start first grade with my daughter,' Ms Evenson said. 'They were so excited for that. This is just hard for everyone to wrap their mind around.' 'We’re dedicated to trying to get to the bottom of what happened to Sierra,' Mr Diamond said during a news conference.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 16:08 EST, 19 September 2011 . Mystery: The boy, known only as Ray, arrived in Berlin earlier this month carrying a rucksack . German police are trying to retrace the steps of the English speaking ‘forest boy’ in an attempt to find his father’s body. They are also investigating reports that the teenager may have criss-crossed Europe during the five years he says he spent living rough in forests with his father. The boy, who is estimated to be 17, says his name is Ray but has little other idea who he is. He arrived in Berlin on September 5, carrying only a rucksack, tent and sleeping bag. He claimed his father Ryan had taken him into the woods south of the German capital five years ago after his mother Doreen died in a car crash, and they had lived there ever since. The boy said his father had died after a fall and he had buried him in a shallow grave before heading north to Berlin, as his father had instructed him to do in the case of an emergency. Police are baffled by the case. Although officers have been unable to locate the grave or establish how the father died, they say the boy’s story so far checks out. A German police spokesman said: ‘What we can say for sure is that we have found nothing at all to disprove the story almost two weeks on. ‘As well as alerting Interpol we have contacted Czech police to see if there is any indication the woodland south of the city that he refers to could have been in Czech territory. ‘It would have been no problem crossing the border and although he says he had been walking north for two weeks, we believe that was a generalisation. Living rough: The boy says he has spent the last five years living in German forests with his father . ‘It could have been shorter, which would have put him in the area of the Erzgebirge Naturpark, or if it was longer it could be the Bavarian National Park, which extends into the Czech Republic.’ German police are believed to have contacted Czech and Austrian officials to find out whether the boy or his father had been arrested for vagrancy or similar offences after suggestions that the pair might have criss-crossed Europe over the years. They have also requested information about any unidentified bodies found buried in woodland over the past year. Police have been working with the boy to try to recreate his route in the two weeks that he was without his father. They have not ruled out that he may have been through some kind of mental trauma, and are giving him psychiatric tests, according to the Daily Telegraph. The boy, who is 5ft 11in, with blond hair and blue eyes, is also being checked against missing child lists. Officials believe the teenager could be British because he speaks English but only basic German. The British Consul is working with police to try to solve the mystery. Linguistic experts are working with him to analyse his accent and determine where he came from. Police said the boy had told them that he and his father had lived in a tent and then later in burrows that they dug themselves. Officials confirmed that the boy was in good physical shape and had no signs of abuse apart from a small scar that was at least three years old. Police have issued DNA and fingerprint evidence as well as a photograph of the blue-eyed and athletic-looking boy to Interpol. Social workers have applied for child protection status for him. The boy is unable to tell them exactly where he buried his father, but claimed he 'followed his compass northwards'. Police believe he could have been living in Bayerischer national park, parts of which cross the border into the Czech Republic, or the Erzgebirge region.","Ray could have criss-crossed Europe with father .

Despite this, they have great power over the UK and in recent times have given prisoners the right to vote and were instrumental in the blocking of the deportation of hate preacher Abu Qatada. They will now preside over a second case after Qatada lodged another appeal against his deportation to Jordan.

The gunned down Russian furniture tycoon romantically linked to Princess Michael of Kent was 'in conflict' with his country's interior ministry before his death, it has emerged. The bullet-riddled body of millionaire Mikhail Kravchenko, 46, was found in a pool of blood beside his Mercedes in an  upmarket neighbourhood outside Moscow on Sunday morning. It has since surfaced that his business had been raided by officers from the ministry's economic unit, with a colleague telling the Telegraph he was a target because of his profitable property portfolio. Distressed: Princess Michael of Kent (left) with her husband the Prince at yesterday's Chelsea Flower Show, and the pair in 2005 (right) with Mikhail Kravchenko . Hand-in-hand: Princess Michael of Kent with Russian millionaire Mikhail Kravchenko in Venice, where they spent four days together. Kravchenko was found dead yesterday . The news came as Princess Michael, 67, went ahead with a pre-planned trip to Chelsea Flower Show yesterday. Accompanying the Queen, and other Royals, she said she was 'very distressed' by the death of her friend - who she was pictured holding hands with during a holiday in Venice. Kravchenko reportedly told a Russian magazine, in the days before his death, how difficult it was to run a small or medium sized business in the country. He said: 'In Russia it is all a business can do to survive - with the exception of those closely linked to the state. Loans are expensive, money is expensive, so furniture retailers do not develop.' Dmitry Potanpenko, managing director of Management Development Group, said his acquaintance was 'under pressure' following the raid. He said: 'Misha was pressed hard, but he did not give up. Now we can most likely expect the seizure of the factory, and then after another two to three resales it will pass into the hands of the real buyer.' Princess Michael of Kent with Russian millionaire Mikhail Kravchenko were alleged to have shared a suite at the Cipriani, one of Venice's most glamorous hotels . The pair were pictured enjoying a day out together in a gondola during their stay in Venice. Both denied an affair was taking place . Police say the tycoon, who built his business empire around his £130million-a-year March 8 furniture brand, was hauled from his car and shot up to ten times. Two ‘professional’ gunmen who knew his whereabouts carried out the killing, and there has been a suggestion there was a mystery passenger with Mr Kravchenko in his car who later vanished. An unnamed source also claimed that before his death Mr Kravchenko had ‘branched out into Russia’s real estate and construction markets’, both of which are ‘notoriously corrupt’, as the furniture market slowed down. The source said: ‘We cannot rule out the common scenario for such shootings – a debt he couldn’t repay or a dispute over ownership of a company or property. Simon Astaire, spokesman for Princess Michael of Kent who was linked to the tycoon following intense scrutiny six years ago, said: ‘Prince and Princess Michael of Kent are very distressed to hear of this tragedy.’ The princess – nicknamed ‘Princess Pushy’ because of her over-confident manner – has always denied having an affair with Mr Kravchenko, 21 years her junior. The two royals and the Russian tycoon together. Princess Michael has strongly denied claims of an affair, but said she and Kravchenko are good friends .

But in 2006 the two were pictured holding hands and staring lovingly into each other's eyes while enjoying a stroll and a gondola ride in Venice. The princess was also reported to have booked a suite at one of Venice’s most expensive hotels for herself under the assumed name of ‘Mrs Green’. At the time, Princess Michael’s spokesman Mr Astaire said the pair – who had met at an interior design exhibition the previous year – had simply forged a friendship after Mr Kravchenko confided in her about the death of his wife and daughter in a car crash in 2001. ‘She has been seeking to be supportive,’ Mr Astaire said. ‘It’s not an affair.’ And later, the princess herself spoke out to deny the claims. She told Hello! magazine: ‘The true nature of our relationship is that it is a very good friendship. ‘I hold hands with all my friends. I don’t think that’s being intimate at all. I’m a very tactile person – I do it all the time.’ Later, Mr Kravchenko also denied claims of an affair, saying: ‘We (the princess and I) have just normal human relations. We are friends.’ Moscow has been awash with rumours surrounding the death of the tycoon, who was regarded as one of Moscow’s most eligible bachelors. Battle: Boris Berezovsky appearing at the High court in London for his dispute with Roman Abramovitch . He was made a widower in 2001 following the death of his wife and their seven-year-old daughter in a car accident. Police said he had been driving only yards from a luxury house he built for his parents at around 2am when he was overtaken and the road blocked. He was then shot five times in the body before being dragged from his car and shot in the head. Some accounts suggested a total of ten shots had been fired. Shocked friends insisted he had had no enemies. Unusually for a wealthy Russian businessman, he was often seen without bodyguards and was described by friends as one of the most ‘modest and unassuming’ of Russia’s super-rich. Friends insisted that his dozen or so businesses in furniture, construction and real estate were all solvent and that despite his vast wealth he had never bothered to hire bodyguards because he had no fears for his safety. One, his aide Marina Sherstyuk, said the news had come ‘like a blow of thunder from a clear sky’. Miss Sherstyuk said everything had been ‘normal’ when she last saw the businessman on Friday at a furniture exhibition. ‘There was absolutely no sign of problems, or tension, no cars following him, no threats – nothing at all indicating that his life could have possibly been in danger,’ she said. ‘He would have never even bothered with bodyguards, he felt no need to use them. He felt no threat at all. For us, as for the inner circle of people who worked closely with him, it was an absolute shock to hear.’ Prince Michael was in Russia last week without the princess. He flew to St Petersburg to be awarded with a degree by a Russian university for services to British-Russian relations. But his trip was overshadowed by revelations that he had accepted £320,000 in secret payments from Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky, a leading foe of president Vladimir Putin. The payments via an offshore company from Mr Berezovsky, who is exiled in London, were disclosed in court documents. The oligarch’s spokesman said: ‘Mr Berezovsky has known the prince since the early 1990s and has a high regard for the prince’s work. He therefore chose to be supportive over a period which ended some years ago.’","Bullet-riddled body of Mikhail Kravchenko found in Moscow on Sunday .

A man who allegedly decapitated his neighbour strolled on to a film set days later and auditioned for a role in a thriller. In a bizarre twist, Jonathon Stenberg landed the part of a policeman in Mystery Road, which was shooting in a remote Queensland town, while officers were trying to track him down. Producers of the film . contacted the media in the hope of gaining some publicity for the project and shedding light on Stenberg's movements before he was captured. Arrested: Jonathan Stenberg allegedly decapitated his neighbour before auditioning for a role in a thriller . The film's assistant director Mark . Ingram told Australia's Daily Telegraph that the crew and a cast . including Hugo Weaving, Jack Thompson and True Blood star Ryan Kwanten . were still in shock over their unlikely encounter with Stenberg. 'We're all still a little shaken by it, it was just totally bizarre,' said Mr Ingram. Stenberg was arrested on Sunday by New South Wales Police in a . remote bush hideout, south of Darwin, after one of the largest manhunts in . the Northern Territory's history. Police allege he murdered Edward Kelly at . his Broadwater home on June 21, and left a hat in place of where his . head should have been. Stenberg appeared in Darwin Magistrate's . Court today, where police successfully sought an extradition order . to send him back to Sydney, where he will be formally charged. Suspect: Jonathon Stenberg has now been extradited back to Sydney, pictured, to stand trial . On the morning of June 23, Mr Ingram was pinning up posters outside the North Gregory Hotel in the tiny rural township of Winton asking locals to audition as extras, when Stenberg wandered up. Mr Ingram said: 'This gentleman came up and said hi, said he was passing through town and wanted to earn a few extra dollars.

'We weren't quite ready to take people in yet, so he said he'd go and buy me a coffee and come back in 20 minutes.' Stenberg returned to the local pub with coffees and biscuits, and Mr Ingram welcomed him in for an audition. 'He was the first one through the door, so he was number one,' he said. The suspect told the producers and director he had extensive experience in the military, was trained in weapons use and had served in Afghanistan. 'He was great. Very polite and well-spoken and he seemed really keen to help out on the film wherever he could,' added Mr Ingram. Stenberg said he had no fixed address, other than the back of his truck, but said he had a builders licence and could help with any props building that might be needed. Impressed with Stenberg's audition and what he had to offer, Mr Ingram emailed him to offer him a role. 'Ironically, because of his military background, we cast him as a policeman,' said Mr Ingram. But on June 25, a day before Stenberg's truck was found in bushland in the Northern Territory, Mr Ingram received an email turning down the role. 'He wrote back saying it was great to meet you, but unfortunately he had to go up north, and wouldn't be able to take on the role,' Mr Ingram said.

He has appeared in a Vancouver court charged with obstructing the course of justice after he admitted swallowing the memory card of 27-year-old Lenami Godinez-Avila plummeting to her death. Orders, 50, has vowed to give up hang gliding after saying he was 'sincerely and deeply sorry' for the death of Avila. Orders was filming the Canadian woman from a camera attached to his helmet as she slipped from the harness on the tandem hang-glider he was piloting. She tried to hold on to Orders' legs but fell 300m when his shoe came off. He said his impulsive behaviour was due to 'overwhelming stress' that included his awaiting 12-year-old daughter on the field where the tandem flight was supposed to land. 'I would like to apologise to Lenami's family, to the police and the public for my panicked action of swallowing the memory card as I did,' said Orders. 'My 12-year-old daughter was present that day and made the situation even more stressful at the time.' Memorial: A group of hang gliders gathered at the place where Lenami Godinez-Avila died to plant a cherry blossom tree and erect a cross a week after her death . Hang glider pilot Jon Orders has apologised for swallowing a memory card that contained footage of a young woman falling to her death in an accident in Canada admitting he 'failed in a major way' Scene: Hang gliders and emergency workers rush to where Lenami Godinez-Avila's body was found after she plummeted 1,000 feet to her death last Saturday . Orders was arrested two days after . the April 28 accident and held in custody for a week while lawyers and . police waited for him to pass the memory card. Nicole . McLearn who was there the day Lenami died said she and her boyfriend were 'joyous' as they watched the other hang gliders take to the air, growing excited . about their turn. She told the Post Media News that as soon as she and Orders became airbound, it was clear something was wrong. She said: 'I could see her starting to slip down his body ... past the waist, down . the legs. Finally she got to the feet and tried to hang on and . obviously couldn't hang on for that much longer and let go, tearing off . the tandem pilot's shoes in the process.' Usually an instructor and the student . should be side by side, but Lenami was below him and it became obvious . she was not hooked in. She was only in the air about 30 seconds before she died. At the launch site, her boyfriend watched what was happening and screamed as she fell: 'No! Lenami! Hang on! I love you!' Police investigating the death of Lenami Godinez-Avila, left, have seized a video card which they say had been swallowed by hang-glider pilot Jon Orders, right . Witness: Nicole McLearn said it became obvious as soon as they took off that something was not right as the instructor was horizontal and Lenami was hanging vertical . Earlier this week, Royal Canadian Mounted Police told a court that X-rays showed the card was inside Orders' body. But officers have confirmed that they now have the card. 'We . have processes in place in order to try and extract what's been on the . card that will not be further discussed at the moment,' Police Constable . Tracy Wolbeck said. Ms Wolbeck said police were focusing on answering questions from Miss Godinez-Avila's family, from Mexico. 'They've come to Canada in search of answers,' the police officer added. Police have not provided any further details about when the card was consumed or how they learned about it. They have also said they have seized video taken by the boyfriend on the ground. Orders is a fully certified hang-gliding pilot and instructor with 16 years' experience. Search for clues: Police examined the hang-glider after the body of Miss Godinez-Avila was found . Crash site: Police believe information stored on a video card could help explain why the incident happened . His business website, Vancouver Hang Gliding, states that photos and video are available when people purchase a tandem hang-gliding trip. When police announced the charge, they said Orders was accused of withholding key evidence. The young woman's body was found in a forest clear cut below Mount Woodside, a popular spot for hang gliders to launch from above British Columbia's Fraser Valley. Jason Warner, safety officer for the Hang Gliders and Paragliders Association of Canada, said that he spoke to Orders minutes after Godinez-Avila fell from the glider. Mr Warner said Orders told him he knew something was wrong almost immediately and tried desperately to hang on to the woman, who clung to his body and then slipped down his legs, taking one of Orders' shoes with her. Miss Godinez-Avila, who was an . administrator at the provincial Ministry of Environment, went hang . gliding after her boyfriend bought her lessons for their anniversary. He was video-recording the flight, but had stopped taping before she fell.","William 'Jon' Orders charged with obstructing the course of justice .

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down more than 1 per cent on doubts the nation will be able to afford to recapitalise its fourth biggest lender Bankia. There are also increasing worries that other Spanish banks will also need bailing out. Banned: Spain's plan to recapitalise its troubled lender Bankia through a ¿19billion 'backdoor bailout' has been rejected as 'unacceptable' by European banking officials . Worries: Spanish foreign minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo (left) and Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy (right) The FTSE 100 Index was nearly 2 per . cent or 96.8 points lower at 5295.3 as Spain saw the yield on its . 10-year bonds rise to a record euro-era high of 6.68 per cent at one . stage. This is close to the 7 per cent level . that pushed Greece, Ireland and Portugal into taking a bailout in a . sign that investors had little faith in the country's ability to deal . with its debts. Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG . Index, said: 'Investor confidence wanes by the day, and it could only . be a matter of time before the Spanish government is forced to ask for . financial aid.' The ongoing eurozone crisis was also . evident in Italy, which saw borrowing costs rise at a debt auction, . affecting banking shares on London's leading shares index. Markets in Europe were also sharply lower, with Germany's Dax and France's Cac-40 off nearly 2 per cent. In London, the uncertainty in Spain . hit banking stocks as Lloyds Banking Group dropped 2 per cent or 0.6p to . 25.4p, Royal Bank of Scotland fell 0.5p to 20.1p and Barclays shed 1.3p . to 179.7p. Rejected: Madrid said it wanted to inject the amount in sovereign bonds into the bank's parent firm, and then swap it for cash at the European Central Bank's three-month refinancing window . However, there was good news for the Government as its borrowing costs fell to an all-time low of 1.73% as investors sought a safe-haven. The tumble came as Spain's plan to . recapitalise its troubled lender Bankia through a €19billion 'backdoor . bailout' was rejected as 'unacceptable' by European banking officials. Madrid said it wanted to inject the . amount in sovereign bonds into the bank's parent firm, and then swap it . for cash at the European Central Bank's three-month refinancing window. This would, it said, avoid the need to raise the money on bond markets. Spain's woes, combined with growing uncertainty about whether Greece will remain in the eurozone, has reignited the 17-nation currency bloc's debt crisis on nervous financial markets, prompting calls for more radical EU action. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso called yesterday for European leaders to agree on a path to full economic union to reassure investors about the future of the euro area. He said: 'It is very important, even if you believe that it doesn't come immediately, to define the trend, the objective. 'It is very important also in terms of confidence for the investment in the euro area now. 'We will support an ambitious and structural approach which should include a roadmap and a timetable for a full economic and monetary union in the euro area.' But, a major survey released yesterday showed support for European integration has fallen sharply across the 27-nation European Union since the debt crisis began. It has raised doubts about the political will for closer economic union. But . the ECB said a proper capital injection was needed for the country's . fourth largest banking institution, reports the Financial Times. And it added that the plans could . breach an EU ban on 'monetary financing'. Policymaker Ewald Nowotny . added : 'It is up to national governments to help banks.' Keith Bowman, equity analyst at . Hargreaves Lansdown, said: 'We have seen that the U.S. and the UK have . made substantial moves in terms of recapitalising their banks. 'The difficulty is, the longer you leave it, the more difficult fund raising becomes and that's what Spain is finding now. 'There . have been some requests for the bailout fund to be used to help Spanish . banks to recapitalise, but the difficulty for the European Central Bank . (ECB) is to know where that stops. 'There are a lot of people who would even question whether the bailout fund is big enough to rescue Spain.' Spain will now issue new bonds to fund it ailing lenders and indebted regions. Foreign minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo said it would nurse hundreds of billions of euros worth of toxic assets from a 2008 real estate bust without international help. But there are fears the move will dent the country's strong liquidity position and further worsen public finances under scrutiny from investors and European officials. It could also weigh on the capacity of the state to finance itself. Spain has already completed more than 55 per cent of its debt issuance for the year and has at least €20billion euros in its coffers. That is on top of more than €4billion still available in the bank restructuring fund, making it possible to recapitalise the ailing lenders and repay debt. However, the central government and regions still have to refinance €98billion out of €117.5billion of debt maturing in 2012 and fund a deficit of €52billion. The next three months, with €38billion to refinance by August, and a second hump in October, when €28billions is due, will be especially difficult. The funding situation is also growing tense in the autonomous regions, with €12billion of debt maturing in the last quarter, more than half of it in the two most-indebted regions, Catalonia and Valencia. In the latest sign of tensions within Spain over the state of the economy and the banks, Bank of Spain governor Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez announced yesterday he would step down on June 10, one month earlier than the end of his mandate. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has said repeatedly - most recently on Monday - his government does not need outside financial help, but most economists disagree. 'The point about Spain is it's going to need some external support of some form,' said David Owen, chief European financial economist at Jefferies. 'Whether that implies the European Central Bank buys bonds (in the secondary market) or moves lock, stock and barrel to quantitative easing over the next three months, certainly the situation at the moment is not sustainable.' Spain has been on an austerity drive to improve its finances but this had deepened a recession and worsened unemployment now affecting a quarter of the workforce and led to protests. Retail sales slumped by 9.8 per cent on the year in April, the biggest fall since the series began in 2003.","Worries Spain can't afford €19billion recapitalisation of fourth-biggest bank .

Baboons can distinguish between written words and gibberish - and other apes can do multiplication and even make plans for the future. The number of ape and monkey cognition . studies has doubled in recent years, often with better technology and . neuroscience paving the way to unusual discoveries. Scientists think that many abilities - such as working out what others are thinking - are not exclusive to human beings. ‘It's not a question of whether they think - it's how they think,’ says Duke University scientist Brian Hare. A 5 1/2-year-old chimpanzee named Ayumu performs a memory test with randomly-placed consecutive numerals . An orangutan presses symbols to communicate at Jungle Island in Miami. Experts who work with primates have been using sign language and other methods to communicate with apes for years . This month scientists mapping the DNA of the bonobo ape found that, like the chimp, bonobos are only 1.3 percent different from humans. Says Josep Call, director of the primate research center at the Max Planck Institute in Germany: ‘Every year we discover things that we thought they could not do.’ Call says one of his recent more surprising studies showed that apes can set goals and follow through with them. Orangutans and bonobos in a zoo were offered eight possible tools - two of which would help them get at some food. At times when they chose the proper tool, researchers moved the apes to a different area before they could get the food, and then kept them waiting as much as 14 hours. In nearly every case, when the apes realized they were being moved, they took their tool with them so they could use it to get food the next day, remembering that even after sleeping. After being told a word, an orangutan points to that object on an iPad computer tablet at Jungle Island zoo in Miami . The goal and series of tasks didn't leave the apes' minds. Call says this is similar to a person packing luggage a day before a trip: ‘For humans it's such a central ability, it's so important.’ For a few years, scientists have watched chimpanzees in zoos collect and store rocks as weapons for later use. In May, a study found they even add deception to the mix. They created haystacks to conceal their stash of stones from opponents, just like nations do with bombs. Hare points to studies where competing chimpanzees enter an arena where one bit of food is hidden from view for only one chimp. The chimp that can see the hidden food, quickly learns that his foe can't see it and uses that to his advantage, displaying the ability to perceive another ape's situation. That's a trait humans develop as toddlers, but something we thought other animals never got, Hare said. And then there is the amazing monkey memory. After being told a word, an orangutan points to that object on an iPad at Jungle Island in Miami . Jacobs says orangutans are extremely intelligent but limited by their physical inability to talk. Jacobs and other trainers at Jungle Island have developed strong relationships with the orangutans and hope to have them eventually use the iPads to communicate with other people . At the National Zoo in Washington, humans who try to match their recall skills with an orangutan's are humbled. Zoo associate director Don Moore says: ‘I've got a Ph.D., for God's sake, you would think I could out-think an orang and I can't.’ In French research, at least two baboons kept memorizing so many pictures - several thousand - that after three years researchers ran out of time before the baboons reached their limit. Researcher Joel Fagot at the French National Center for Scientific Research figured they could memorize at least 10,000 and probably more. And a chimp in Japan named Ayumu who sees strings of numbers flash on a screen for a split-second regularly beats humans at accurately duplicating the lineup. He's a YouTube sensation, along with orangutans in a Miami zoo that use iPads. The trend in research is to identify some new thinking skill that chimps can do, revealing that certain abilities are ‘not uniquely human,’ said Emory University primatologist Frans de Waal. Then the scientists find that same ability in other primates further removed from humans genetically. Then they see it in dogs and elephants. ‘Capacities that we think in humans are very special and complex are probably not so special and not so complex,’ de Waal said. ‘This research in animals elevates the animals, but it also brings down the humans.... If monkeys can do it and maybe dogs and other animals, maybe it's not as complex as you think.’ At Duke, professor Elizabeth Brannon shows videos of monkeys that appear to be doing a ‘fuzzy representation’ of multiplication by following the number of dots that go into a box on a computer screen and choosing the right answer to come out of the box. This is after they've already done addition and subtraction. This spring in France, researchers showed that six baboons could distinguish between fake and real four-letter words - BRRU vs KITE, for example. And they chose to do these computer-based exercises of their own free will, either for fun or a snack. One reason scientists are learning more about animal intellect is computers, including touch screens. In some cases, scientists are setting up banks of computers available to primates 24-7. In the French word recognition experiment, Fagot found he got more and better data when it was the baboons' choice to work. Animal cognition researcher Steve Ross at the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago agrees. ‘The apes in our case seem to be working better when they have that control, that choice to perform,’ he said. In the French study, the baboons can recognize that the letters KITE make a word because through trial and error they learn which letters tend to go together in what order. But the baboons don't have a clue of what KITE means. It's that gap that's key. ‘The boundaries are not as sharp as people think, but there are certain things you can't overcome and language is one of them,’ said Columbia University animal cognition researcher Herbert Terrace. And that leads to another difference, Ross said. Because apes lack language skills, they learn by watching and mimicking. Humans teach with language and explanation, which is faster and better, Ross said.","Baboons can tell real words from random jumbles of letters .

Nicolas Sarkozy was today bracing himself to be summoned by judges investigating a variety of fraud cases as his presidential immunity officially ends. The prospect of France's former head of state facing criminal proceedings has already been raised by two examining judges. A serving president cannot be prosecuted, but Sarkozy’s immunity ends at midnight tonight following his election defeat to Francois Hollande last month. Casting a shadow: Now that former French President Nicolas Sarkozy is about to lose his legal immunity, he faces a string of fraud probes relating to his time in office . No more protection: Sarkozy and wife Carla Bruni leave the Elysee Palace after Francois Hollande (back centre) was sworn in as French President following last month's election . Sarkozy has already faced accusations that the office of French president – the second-most powerful executive position in the world – was bused to harbour a criminal and that he should have already waived his immunity while in office. Judge Jean-Michel Gentil believes that Liliane Bettencourt, the L'Oreal cosmetics heiress and France's richest woman, may have illegally contributed two payments of 400,000 euros (£335,000) each to Sarkozy's 2007 election campaign. Both were traced to Swiss accounts, and one was allegedly received by Sarkozy in person in Paris, in return for offering Mrs Bettencourt tax breaks once he came to power. A prosecuting source close to the so-called 'Bettencourt Affair’ said: 'According to the French Constitution, Mr Sarkozy will be available for summons within a month of May 16. Facing probe: Judges are keen to question Sarkozy about Liliane Bettencourt (pictured), the L'Oreal cosmetics heiress and France's richest woman, who may have illegally contributed 800,000 euros to his 2007 election campaign . 'He will be called to explain his role in alleged illegal party funding within months and may be placed under investigation with a view to prosecution.' Sarkozy's former treasurer, Eric . Woerth, is just one of numerous close associates currently under . judicial investigation in connection with the Bettencourt Affair. Judge . Renaud Van Ruymbeke also 'urgently' needs to question Sarkozy about his . part in the so-called 'Karachi Affair’, which involves illegal arms . sales to Pakistan and the murders of 11 French workers in a bomb attack. Sarkozy . was the campaign spokesman for presidential candidate Edouard Balladur . when kickbacks from Pakistanis were said to be secretly paying for his . electoral campaign in 1995. 'Sarkozy will certainly have to answer to the Judge once he loses the presidency,' said another judicial source in Paris. There is so much evidence being massed . against Sarkozy that Eva Joly, a former anti-terrorist judge who . herself stood as Green party candidate for the presidency, said he . should have waived his immunity from prosecution earlier. Joly . said 'We now have proof' pointing towards the 'illicit financing of . Nicolas Sarkozy's campaign in 2007' and that this was 'very serious for . democracy’. Segolene Royal, . who stood as Socialist candidate for president five years ago, . suggested that the main reason Sarkozy had been desperate to remain in . office was to 'avoid prosecution'. Suspicions aroused: There are also compelling claims that Sarkozy may have received millions of pounds in illegal funding from the late Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi (right), meeting the ex-French President here in 2007 . Precedent: Sarkozy will be particularly worried because Jacques Chirac (right), his conservative predecessor, received a two-year suspended prison sentence last December for misusing public funds . Sarkozy will be particularly worried because Jacques Chirac, his conservative predecessor, received a two-year suspended prison sentence last December for misusing public funds – making him the first former French in history to receive a criminal conviction. There are also compelling claims that Sarkozy may have received millions of pounds in illegal funding from the late Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. Suspicions were raised when Sarkozy invited the tyrannical dictator to Paris for a state visit within months of his election in 2007. Sarkozy has regularly denied any wrong-doing, but has so far produced no evidence in response to any of the allegations. Sarkozy is now living in Paris with his third wife, the former supermodel Carla Bruni, and their baby daughter, Giulia. The conservative politician is a trained lawyer and has opened a small office in the French capital, from where he is expected to work on his defence to all the allegations. Slur: A new semi-fictional book written by a member of Nicolas Sarkozy's own party depicts him as a violent dictator . A controversial new book has portrayed Nicolas Sarkozy as a violent dictator who had sex with female politicians in his office at the Elysee Palace. The thinly-veiled fictional account of his presidency written by a member of his own UMP political party is said to have sent shockwaves through his inner circle. Author Marie-Celie Guillaume has insisted that although names and dates have been changed, all the events depicted are based on fact. In one scene in her book, The Monarch, His Son, His Fiefdom, the character Rocky, who is said to be based on Sarkozy, is miming boxing moves in front of a mirror in his office when a young female MP enters. Ms Guillaume, who claims the event actually happened, said the woman had come to ask him about funding for a museum project, but he replied by telling her he was feeling 'very hot'. He is quoted as telling the MP: 'Look at the state I'm in. You can't leave me like this. Be nice. You can see I need relaxing. Come on, it's no big deal.' The woman is then said to have 'obliged' Sarkozy with a 'little treat'. But Ms Guillaume adds: 'The sexual exchange was very brief because the monarch was very busy.' France's 20 Minutes news website said: 'The author has said publicly that this is a true story.' Ms Guillaume was chief cabinet director to the head of Sarkozy's UMP party Patrick Devedjian, and is said to have turned against the president when he overlooked Mr Devedjian for a place in government. Shockwaves: The novel claims Sarkozy had sex with female politicians in his office at the Elysee Palace, seen here on the day he took office from outgoing President Jacques Chirac in 2007 . In an interview with France's Marianne magazine, Ms Guillaume insisted she was not seeking revenge on Sarkozy for betraying her former boss. She said: 'I wrote it because I needed an outlet. 'These are the kinds of things that go on in the corridors of power. Everything I have written about is based on fact.' Asked which character most embodied the 'political violence'  portrayed in the book, she added: 'Rocky, and his violence is all the more shocking because he is the monarch and the person who is supposed to unite and pacify.' But staunch Sarkozy ally Isabelle Balkany, the deputy mayor of the Paris suburb of Levallois, said: 'I find it astonishing that she dare write a pseudo-satirical and borderline slanderous book about elected officials from the community she works for. 'It is an outrage on every level.'","Ex-French President expected to be summoned by judges investigating a variety of fraud cases .

The pair had becomed embroiled in a political spat last week when it emerged that Miss Trierweiler had tweeted support for a politician standing against Miss Royal, 58, in parliamentary elections. A presidential aide said Miss Trierweiler, 47 – nicknamed the Rottweiler – had since been told to ‘stay in the shadows’ because president Francois Hollande was ‘furious’ at her intervention. Backtrack: France's controversial new first lady Valerie Trierweiler (left) now 'regrets' humiliating the mother of the President's four children Segolene Royal (right) But the row dubbed the 'the war of the . roses' erupted again last night when Miss Royal, who said she was . 'wounded' by the 'violent blow', claimed Miss Trierweiler had been . undermining her career for years since starting a relationship with her . ex-partner. Miss Segolene, the mother of President . Hollande's four children, had already accused senior Socialist . politicians of not being supportive enough in her 2007 campaign. But she went a step further in an . interview with French weekly Le Point yesteryday, claiming France's . first lady had kept Mr Hollande away from her during the campaign. She said: 'I realise that in 2007 (Mr . Hollande's affair with Trierweiler) can't have helped matters. I now . understand why François didn't help me. 'In 2007, I said to myself: 'It will pass, it'll work itself out.' So I took it on the chin.' Miss Royal is said to have told friends that Miss Trierweiler is a 'traitor' who her treated her disgracefully. Ms Trierweiler took to Twitter to announce her support for socialist Olivier Falorni . Miss Royal said it was unfair that . Miss Trierweiler had been allowed to carry on writing about Mr Hollande . in her 'Paris Match' arts column. Miss Royal told Le Point: 'In an . Anglo-Saxon country, she would have been fired the same day. But Paris . Match was not unhappy to see me weakened, so they let (the relationship) go on deliberately, just like all those others who knew ...(Paris Match . owner) Lagardère, Sarkozy.' Her outburst finished when she claimed that 'I'm the one whose family has been broken, I'm, the one who should bear a grudge.' France's first lady said last night she regretted humiliating the mother of the president’s four children. Mr Hollande, who lived with Miss Royal . for 30 years, wanted to make her the speaker of the National Assembly . but backed down when she lost the election. Telling off: Following Valerie Trierweiler's (pictured right) Twitter comments, Prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said 'everyone should know their place' A friend of Miss Trierweiler said she admitted: ‘I made a mistake.’ The friend added: ‘She did not calculate the consequences.’ Ms Trierweiler, who has been divorced . twice, has three sons of her own and said that the only reason she had . not travelled to Mexico with Hollande for the G8 meeting was because . they have exams this week. Intriguingly, Ms Trierweiler's . personal biography has disappeared from the Elysee Palace website, but . another aide insisted that it was 'being edited' and would return. But the same aide confirmed that Ms . Trierweiler was being encouraged to 'remain in the shadows'  because Ms . Hollande was 'furious' at the way she has behaved so far. Glamour: Hollande initially painted himself as an antidote to the flash previous President Nicolas Sarkozy, who married model Carla Bruni . Referring to the tweet, he said 'clearly this cannot happen again'. Despite the continuing saga which has . reduced the Elysee to a soap opera, journalist Ms Trierweiler's arts . column is set to appear in Paris Match magazine this week. And she has insisted she will not give up her Twitter account. Mr Hollande has now refused to give Ms Royal a job because she lost the La Rochelle seat in western France so heavily. But, despite consistent defeats since . being rejected for the presidency in 2007, Ms Royal insists that she can . revive her political career.","Miss Royal, 58, claimed Valerie Trierweiler 'undermined her career'

A Congolese warlord has become the first person to be jailed at a special war-crimes tribunal after being found guilty of training child soldiers and forcing them to fight. Thomas Lubunga was jailed for 14 years for abducting children, some as young as 11, and sending them to fight in his . Union of Congolese Patriots (UCP) militia in Congo's eastern Ituri region in 2002 and 2003. The 51-year-old is the first person to be convicted by the International Criminal Court, sitting in The Hague, Netherlands, with presiding Judge Adrian Fulford saying the sentence reflected the need to protect children in wartime. Jailed: Warlord Thomas Lubunga clasps his hands at the court in The Hague, Netherlands, as he waits for his sentence to be handed down today after being found guilty of training child soldiers and forcing them to fight . 'The vulnerability of children means they need to be afforded particular protection,' he said at the sentencing hearing. Prosecutors had asked for a 30-year . sentence, but said they would be willing to cut it to 20 years if . Lubanga offered a 'genuine apology' to victims of his crimes. Lubunga, convicted in March, abducted children, training boys in military training camps and forcing them to fight, . while girls allegedly served as sex slaves. He led the UCP, an ethnic Hema militia, active in the war which began as a struggle over control of the gold-rich land in the Ituri region and its main town of Bunia, in 1999. It turned into an inter-ethnic war displacing hundreds of thousands of people and leaving thousands dead. Shocking: A child soldier practices with a machine gun in an ethnic Hema militia camp, in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2003 and right, Lubunga showed now emotion as the sentence was read out today . Rights activists hailed the case as a . milestone in efforts to prosecute the widespread use of child soldiers . in conflicts around the world. Lubanga, . wearing a grey suit and tie, showed no emotion as Fulford read out the . sentence. He can appeal his conviction and sentence. Fulford said that time Lubanga has served in pretrial detention since March 2006, following his arrest in 2005, would be deducted from the sentence. It . was not immediately clear where Lubanga would be jailed. The court has . no prison cells for holding convicted war criminals, but has deals with . seven countries to jail them - Denmark, Serbia, Mali, Austria, Finland, . Britain and Belgium. In court: Lubunga, 51, became the first person to be convicted by the International Criminal Court, sitting in The Hague, Netherlands, and has been jailed for 14 years for training child soldiers to fight on the frontline . Fulford gave Lubanga three sentences of 13, 12 and 14 years each, respectively for conscripting, enlisting and using child soldiers but the sentences are to be served concurrently. Conscripting involves abducting children and pressing them into military service while enlisting them can be voluntary. Franck Mulenda, a legal representative for 140 victims in the case, welcomed the sentence. 'It is very important. It consoles the victims,' he said outside court. He said he is now waiting for the court to order reparations for former child soldiers, 'so they can get back their education and their place in society.' More young soldiers pictured leaving a militia training camp in the Democratic Republic of Congo in June 2003 . Fulford criticiced former chief prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo for not bringing charges of sexual violence against Lubanga or presenting evidence of such crimes at a sentencing hearing last month. Rights activists say Lubanga's militia was responsible for widespread rape in Ituri. He also praised Lubanga for being 'respectful and cooperative' throughout the case despite it twice being held up by prosecutors defying court orders linked to identifying witnesses.","Thomas Lubunga is first person to be convicted by the International Criminal Court's war crimes tribunal .

"By . Meghan Keneally . PUBLISHED: . 22:32 EST, 17 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 22:41 EST, 17 July 2012 . Talking in code: Nearly 150 recorded phone calls made by George Zimmerman were released by prosecutors today . Recorded phone calls released today show that George Zimmerman spoke in code while talking to his wife about life in prison and to his friend about the amount of money he had raised through an online donation site for supporters. In addition to talking to family and friends, Zimmerman called the controversial Koran-burning pastor Terry Jones who planned to host a rally in support of the neighborhood watchman, using religious messages to urge Mr Jones to cancel the spectacle. Almost 150 calls were made public as a continuing evidence dump by the Florida state attorney prosecution team, a number of them showing how Zimmerman was very aware that his calls were being recorded and that he and his family used codes and their bilingual language skills to keep their true meanings hidden. As a warning at the beginning of one . of his joint calls with his wife Shellie and his sister Susie, Zimmerman . invokes Florida's last high-profile court case. 'You . remember the Casey Anthony case? Anything you say on the phone is going . to end up on WTMJ,' he said referring to a local radio station. Business Insider . reports that Shellie was discussing when Zimmerman would be released . from jail, and rather than using standard dates and months, she made . sure only those involved would understand. 'It's gonna be at Susie's birth month, maybe sooner,' she said. 'Honey, you have no idea what's going on but I cannot tell you,' she continued. The 37-hours of calls took place while George Zimmerman was in jail after being charged with the second degree murder of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin. During a different call, Shellie became audibly upset that he had shared some information- which we still do not know- with his family. Released: Before leaving on a bail bond on July 6 (seen above), Zimmerman used the code of his sister Susie's birth month as the way to describe the date to his wife . 'Oh my God! Okay, well, if we're all screwed that's fine,' she said. His sister Susie then interjects as a moderator of sorts. 'The thing is, that things are being recorded,' Susie said. 'I didn't say, I didn't say it like that. It was, you know, in code,' George responded, admitting that they had clearly been trying to hide their conversations. While that supposed coded interaction . is still unidentified, Zimmerman's phone call with controversial . preacher Terry Jones does not appear to be covert, but Mr Jones still . doesn't seem to understand. On . April 19, Zimmerman appealed to Mr Jones' religious senses when he . called to stop an upcoming rally that Mr Jones had arranged. I . was calling today to ask you humbly, from one God-fearing sinner to . another, for time for healing, for not only the city of Sanford but . America,' Mr Zimmerman said in the call according to NBC News' The Grio. Wife and confidante: Shellie Zimmerman, left, was charged with lying during the bond hearing of her husband . 'I know that your intentions are good, and I know that ultimately God will see his will be done, however, I see that Saturday -- I just ask that you allow the city to heal and America to heal. 'I just ask that perhaps instead of coming Saturday and protesting, we allow law enforcement to do their job and not lose focus, and that perhaps you could even come and visit and pray with me instead of protesting.' Support: One of the recordings calls into question whether attorney Mark O'Mara (right) knew about the full volume of funds that had been donated to Zimmerman (left) online . Mr Jones did not give up on his plans quickly, however, simply grunting along and eventually uttering 'hmm... okay.' He stressed that he felt the protest was necessary 'to sort of counter what has been going on in the news media and to pull us back to the Constitution and pull us back to justice and, of course, part of the message will be in the area of forgiveness.' 'I think it could be a very vital step in that area but, okay, we will definitely consider that.' Other phone calls are lighter on the substance, containing his complaints about the fact that it took several days for him to get his anti-anxiety medication. In another call, he tells a friend that much of the publicity of the case would have been avoided had his parents named him something more Hispanic like 'Jorge'. The Miami Herald . says that Zimmerman's lawyer, Frank Taaffe, had been approached by . someone identified only as 'S.H'. The paper speculates that the man in . question may be Fox News host Sean Hannity, though the news network . officially denied the theory on Tuesday. Mr . Taaffe would not say who approached him on behalf of what group, but he . did say that part of the deal would involve Zimmerman using Jose Baez, . the divisive lawyer who represented Casey Anthony. The . first time that Zimmerman got in trouble for his coded calls was when . he and his wife undershot the amount of money they had in their donation . account. For instance, The Huffington Post reports that they said $8 when they meant $80,000 and $37 for $37,000. Questionable contacts: In one call, Zimmerman reminds his wife and sister to keep their language coded because of when local radio stations played Casey Anthony's (right) calls . Plea to a pastor: Zimmerman called Terry Jones (pictured), best known for wanting to burn a Koran on the anniversary of 9/11, urging him to stop a rally in support of Zimmerman so that the community could heal . While Shellie was arrested and charged with perjury on that count- and subsequently released on $1,000 bond- the latest phone calls show that Zimmerman's lawyer may have lied about knowing the true amount in the questionable account. Publicly, attorney Mark O'Mara has denied knowing how much was in the account, which is understandable because if he did then he too can be charged with perjury or contempt of court. Zimmerman was recorded telling his friend Scott that his lawyer had assured him that the thousands he accrued through the site were not a legal factor because 'Right now you're not working. You're not providing an income for your family. You're probably not going to be employable for the rest of your life,' Scott asked if Mr O'Mara knew about 'the volume' of the donations and Zimmerman said no, but his prior statement shows that Mr O'Mara may have had a general idea.","State attorneys released 150 recorded calls made by Zimmerman .

Nellie Geraghty died from her injuries after her handbag containing the ashes of her late husband Frank was snatched . An elderly widow who died after she was robbed of her handbag containing her husband's ashes was allegedly set upon by a drug addict  desperate for cash to fund his habit. Nellie Geraghty, 79, was found minutes away from her home with the strap of her handbag still firmly in her grasp having suffered a heart attack and serious head injuries form which she later died in hospital. Drug addict Mark Royle, 37, wrenched the handbag from the 4ft10in lady and 'kicked, punched or stamped' her in the head causing severe damage, a court head today. She was found lying face down in the mud battered, bruised and unconscious still clutching the strap of the bag that contained her husband’s ashes and over £100 in cash, Manchester Crown Court was told. Mr Royle, a known drug addict of no fixed abode, moved on the streets of Shaw, Oldham, where Mrs Geraghty lived in a bungalow at a sheldered accommodation for the elderly. Mrs Geraghty had lived alone since her husband Frank passed away in the mid-nineties. Although described as 'active and independent' she missed her husband and had taken to carrying some of his ashes with her in her shoulder bag or handbag whenever she left her house. Prosecution say Mr Royle attacked and robbed Mrs Geraghty of her shoulder bag and its contents on November 24th last year. The alleyway in Shaw, near Oldham, Greater Manchester where Mrs Geraghty was found face down in the mud last November still clutching the strap of her handbag . Mrs Geraghty was on her way to her regular luncheon club around midday when she was attacked around midday. But the ‘active and independent’ lady only managed to get 100 yards from her home. She died from 'a catalogue of injuries to her head and body' less than 48 hours later without ever gaining consciousness Peter Wright QC, prosecuting told the jury. Mr Royle denies the charges of murder, an alternative charge of manslaughter and robbery. Mr Wright said Mr Royle was a user of hard drugs at the time and was funding his drug use in part by committing crime. ‘On this occasion he resorted to a crime of violence to fund his drug habit.’ Wedding: Mr and Mrs Geraghty, centre, pictured on their wedding day in 1969 . The attack on Mrs Geraghty was so violent that she was rendered unconscious and suffered such severe head injuries that she required treatment in an intensive care unit. Prosecution say that by delivering at least one heavy blow via a punch, kick or stamp to a frail old lady could only mean the defendant intended to inflict really serious harm. Mr Wright said the jury would hear evidence from a neuropathologist who will say that the injuries to the head were caused by 'considerable force' which caused the brain to shift. Despite warnings from her close family, Mrs Geraghty carried large sums of money with her. It was not uncommon for her to have between £130 and £200 in her purse. She was last seen passing the home of a neighbour who was hanging out her washing and appeared to be fit and well on her way to a cut-through to Shaw town centre. Mrs Geraghty had her bag over her right shoulder and was following her usual route to the lunch club. Mr Wright said: ‘Within minutes of her last sighting, she was violently attacked and relieved of her shoulder bag and its contents which in all likelihood included a substantial amount of cash and her late husband’s ashes.’ Nellie Geraghty is pictured with her late husband Frank on a holiday in 1994 not long before he passed away . ‘Her bag was missing. It appeared to have been wrenched from her grasp and snapped at the strap. Notwithstanding the fact that she was deeply unconscious, she still had hold of the strap from which the bag appeared to have been torn.’ Prosecution said Mrs Geraghty’s injuries were consistent with her having been knocked to the ground by a violent blow or punch or a kick or stamp as she lay on the ground. ‘Either way,’ Mr Wright added: ‘We say this was a violent attack on a vulnerable and elderly lady in which she sustained serious injuries that later led to her death.’ Mr Royle was spotted cycling around in . the nearby town centre on local CCTV from the day of the robbery and . riding away from the scene afterwards. The . prosecution said earlier in the day Royle was desperate for drugs and . had tried to sell his mountain bike to raise money to feed his . addiction. Mr Royle had left . a drug addict friend’s home that morning in order to find some money. He returned about an hour later with a substantial amount of cash, . including crisp £20 notes. Royle claimed he had broken into a car and stolen a laptop which he sold for cash. There was no record of any such theft that day. Smiling: Mrs Geraghty's handbag contained £100 in cash and the ashes of her late husband Frank, pictured with Nellie at a family wedding in 1993 . Mr Wright added: ‘Moreover, on his return, Royle seemed concerned about his appearance and was keen to obtain a change of clothing.’ Mobile telephone records link him to a drug dealer after the theft of the handbag and later Royle left Shaw for Manchester, where he stayed with another know drug user. During that time, the friend remember a conversation with the defendant during which Royle admitted doing handbag snatches and showed him a substantial amount of cash and asked him to buy drugs with it. Prosecution said Mr Royle had told his friend he got it from a handbag  admitting he had done a snatch from a woman that had ‘gone a bit naughty.’ Royle was eventually arrested on December 9 after members of the public chased him down after he returned snached a lady’s handbag in Rochdale town centre. Questioned about Mrs Geraghty’s death, he admitted being the cyclist caught on CCTV in the area but declined to answer further questions about his movements later that day. The trial continues.","Frail Nellie Geraghty had head injuries consistent with those resulting of a 'heavy blow via a punch, kick or stamp'

Three elderly Kenyans who claim  they were tortured under British rule will today demand an apology and damages at the High Court. The trio say they suffered ‘unspeakable acts of brutality’ in UK-run detention camps during the Mau Mau rebellion between 1952 and 1960. If they win their case, it could lead to thousands more demanding compensation via no-win no-fee lawyers. Kenyans (L-R) Wambugu Wa Nyingi, Jane Muthoni and Paulo Nzili appearing outside the High Court last year. They are taking the British Government to court over allegations that they were tortured during the Mau Mau uprising . The claimants are expected in a two-week hearing to give moving testimony at the High Court in London. The Foreign Office, which denies liability, said they had left it too late to claim. Archbishop Desmond Tutu has urged David Cameron to concede the case, accusing the Government of continuing to refuse to deal with ‘these elderly torture victims with the dignity they deserve'. Jane Mara says she suffered appalling sexual abuse. Wambugu Nyingi says he was suspended by his feet and beaten unconscious in an incident in which 11 men were clubbed to death. He claims cold water was poured on his face to stop him breathing. And Paulo Nzili, 85, is expected to tell the court he was castrated during the atrocities allegedly committed at the hands of British soldiers. All three were held in detention camps during the 1950s. The Foreign Office, which denies liability, said the group had left it too late to claim. Archbishop Tutu adds in his letter: 'It is high time that the British Government showed some magnanimity and compassion.' Angry: Archbishop Desmond Tutu has urged David Cameron to concede the . case, accusing the Government of continuing to refuse to deal with 'these elderly torture victims with the dignity they deserve' A year ago the Kenyans won a historic ruling which took them one step nearer to achieving their goal when Mr Justice McCombe said they had 'arguable cases in law'. The fresh hearing will focus on the Government's argument that the claims cannot proceed because they have been brought outside the legal time limit - but lawyers for the Kenyans will argue that it is an exceptional case in which the judge should exercise his discretion in their favour. In his letter to Mr Cameron, Archbishop Tutu accuses the Government of 'relying on legal technicalities in response to allegations of torture of the worst kind'. The claims are being brought with the support of the Kenya Human Rights Commission and the Kenya government. Issue: Archbishop Tutu urged David Cameron not to relying on legal . technicalities . Solicitor Martyn Day, senior partner from law firm Leigh Day & Co, said: 'The history of what happened to the Mau Mau in Kenya during the 1950s at the hands of the British is a very sorry and distressing tale. It is however a tale that has to be told, if we as the British people are to learn from the mistakes of the past.' He said his firm's clients had been 'waiting for this day for a long time', adding: 'We are pleased for them that at long last they have their chance to give their evidence to the court. Our clients are elderly with likely few years left to live.' Initially, there were four claimants but one has died since the case was started in 2009. Mr Day said the claimants wanted an apology and a Mau Mau welfare fund to ensure that they, and their comrades, could live with an element of dignity in their final days. Opening the case for the Kenyans, Richard Hermer QC said the crux issue was whether a fair trial was still possible. He argued that the existence of thousands of official records and other sources of primary contemporary documentation meant a fair trial was possible, despite the passage of time and the death of certain witnesses. He acknowledged the task was going to be painstaking and time-consuming. He said: 'It is going to take a long time, cost a lot of money and occupy court time. All that gives rise to notions of proportionality.' But he said it was an important case and the court should not be put off by its complexity. However the Foreign Office argued the case should be thrown out. Its QC, Guy Mansfield, said: 'It would be contrary to principle and the balance of fairness to allow this matter to proceed to a trial. There cannot be a fair trial of the issues.' He said that the Foreign Office faced 'irredeemable difficulties' in respect of the availability of witnesses and documents in defending the claim. Those in senior positions in the Colonial Office, the War Office, the British Army and the Kenyan Colonial Administration would ideally be called as witnesses - but most of them were now dead, he said. 'Without those witnesses, and indeed with the necessarily limited recollections of those who do survive, the very complicated and difficult task of determining the competing factual positions cannot be fairly conducted,' the QC argued.In a written submission, the Foreign Office declared: 'After so long, it is simply impossible.'","Trio say they suffered ‘unspeakable acts .

Apple has quietly removed a highly controversial Chinese game which portrayed  Japanese ninjas and sumo wrestlers attacking disputed islands in the East China Sea. The game, 'Defend the Diaoyu Islands' disappeared from the App Store this week, reportedly due to its political and racial content. The game refers to islands which are the subject of a heated dispute over ownership between the two countries - and the racially charged game would have served to inflame the conflict. The game, 'Defend the Diaoyu Islands' disappeared from the App Store this week, reportedly due to its political and racial content . Apple normally polices what can be released very strictly, removing apps that contain nudity or other offensive material. 'Jew . or not Jew' - 'Juif ou pas Juif' in French, which allowed users to find . out whether French celebrities were Jewish, was removed by Apple last year. Japan lodged a protest with China on . Wednesday against the entry of Chinese patrol ships into waters near . disputed islands in the East China Sea, an issue that has long been a . cause of friction between Asia's two biggest economies. China Daily said that the game violated an App Store policy which stated that games, 'cannot target a specific race, culture, real government or . corporation or any other real entity.' Apple has not provided any reason as to why the game has disappeared from the App Store. Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura said three Chinese fishery patrol ships entered waters near the uninhabited islands, known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China. The islands, claimed by Beijing and Tokyo as well as Taipei, are located near rich fishing grounds and potentially huge oil and gas reserves. Japan said last week it was considering a plan to buy the islands from private landowners instead of letting the nationalist governor of Tokyo go ahead with a similar plan, a move diplomatic experts said may have been intended to dampen tensions but which risked backfiring and sending Sino-Japanese ties into a deep chill. Apple's iTunes store is rigidly policed - Apple vet everything sold through it . 'It is clear that the Senkaku islands are inherently Japanese territory from a historical point of view and in terms of international law and that they are under the effective control of Japan,' Fujimura told a news conference. The three Chinese ships later left the waters, with Japanese patrol ships keeping close watch.","Game removed from app store .

A graphic video allegedly showing flamboyant entertainer Roy Horn groping employees and squeezing their nipples is being offered for sale, it was reported today. The illusionist, who was nearly killed by a tiger in 2003, is shown sexually assaulting three caretakers, according to website TMZ, which claims to have seen the video. TMZ described the video as 'extremely disturbing' and reported that the men had filed a lawsuit against the entertainer, who made millions as one half of magic duo Siegfried & Roy. Mr Horn has undergone extensive rehabilitation after he was mauled by a white tiger during a live show. The film, shot in 2010, apparently shows the German-born illusionist assaulting a caretaker who was helping him to the bathroom. He allegedly puts his hand on the caretaker's bottom and thrusts his own bottom into the man's crotch. TMZ reported that, in two clips, the entertainer is seen grabbing the genitals of two male caretakers. He reaches under the shirt of one of the caretakers and seems to tweak his nipples, at which point the man appears to writhe in pain. Mr Horn is said to have whipped one of the caretakers with an oxygen tube. He also manhandled one of the caretakers and forcibly kissed him on the mouth, the website added. TMZ said the caretakers, who are all family men, were suing Mr Horn in a Nevada court for alleged sexual assaults. Last September the Las Vegas Sun reported that Siegfried and Roy had been awarded $37,415 against attorneys who had been suing Mr Horn over unrelated sexual harassment allegations. Showtime: Mr Horn (right), pictured with his stage partner, Siegfried Fischbacher, was nearly killed after being mauled by white tiger Montecore . Critical: The magician was treated for life-threatening injuries after being mauled by the tiger . Attorneys for Oliver Preiss, a former personal assistant to Roy Horn, and for Preiss’s wife Beatrice were ordered to pay the money as a sanction for asserting 'baseless' legal claims against Mr Horn and a company owned by Siegfried and Roy. Preiss made headlines in 2010 with a lawsuit filed in Clark County District alleging that he was fired by Mr Horn after rejecting the entertainer’s sexual advances. Mr Horn was bitten in the neck by a seven-year-old male tiger named Montecore, who had been trained with Siegfried & Roy for six years. He suffered severe blood loss and was said to have suffered a stroke and had to have a quarter of his skull removed to relieve pressure on his swelling brain. Famous: Siegfried and Roy, pictured with Michael Jackson in 2002, were once named among the top ten highest-paid entertainers in the U.S. He was also paralysed temporarily and had to undergo extensive rehabilitation in Los Angeles. Siegfried & Roy, who were once named among the top ten highest-paid entertainers in the U.S., closed their show immediately after the accident. They returned to the stage for a 'final stage appearance' with Montecore in 2009, but officially announced their retirement in 2010. Mr Horn was unavailable for comment.

The first Briton ever to win a stage of the Tour de France has paid tribute to the 'fantastic achievement' of Bradley Wiggins in this year's event, which 'puts British cycling at the top of the tree'. Brian Robinson, 81, is on his way to Paris for the end of the famous race, and is fully expecting Wiggins to seal victory when he finishes the gruelling event tomorrow. Mr Robinson won a stage of the Tour in 1958 and then repeated the feat in 1959. Brian Robinson leads fellow competitors near the end of the first stage of 138 miles from Rheims to Liege in the Tour de France 1956 . He said his reaction to Wiggins's successes in this year's event can be summed up as 'euphoria - a job well done'. 'It's fantastic,' he said. 'We never dreamed of this in my early days. We were scrubbing along at the back of the bunch. Keep on rolling: Brian Robinson, 81, outside his home in Mirfield, West Yorkshire . 'To go right through the bunch, if you like, and to get to the top by a Brit is great. 'It can't get any better, can it?' Speaking at his home in Mirfield, West Yorkshire, where he still rides his bike regularly, Mr Robinson rejected any suggestion that modern cyclists had an easier ride than those of his generation. 'I don't think so, no,' he said. 'Riding the bike is riding the bike. No matter how good the bike is, you've still got to push it. 'You've got to work at it 100 per cent and, sometimes, a little bit over. 'The facilities are easier and probably the infrastructure of the sport, but you still have to do it.' He said: 'It puts British cycling at the top of the tree, really, which I've longed for for a long time. 'It's been a long journey, but since we've got lottery funding that's helped a great deal. And we've got the structure now to bring on our youngsters, which is another great thing.' Mr Robinson remembers riding to Windsor to watch the cycling at the 1948 Olympics with his brother Desmond and then competing in the road race at the 1952 Helsinki games, where he came 27th. Asked what he thought of Wiggins's chances at the Olympics in London, he said: 'If he comes out of the Tour in good shape and gets a decent rest this week, he's as good a chance as anyone, because most of the other riders have been in the Tour anyway. 'If Bradley comes out in good physical shape, gets a good rest and gets his head into shape, I see no reason why not.' He said he has tickets to the track cycling but will be watching Wiggins in the road race on TV. Pedal power: Britain's Bradley Wiggins wears the coveted yellow jersey as he leads the 2012 Tour de France . Taking the lead: Mr Robinson said he thinks the future of British cycling is rosy . He said he has spoken to Wiggins on the phone before, but missed the chance to say hello to him at a charity event when he injured himself falling off his bike. 'I'm hoping to put that right this weekend,' he said. 'But everyone else will be wanting to do the same thing.' Mr Robinson said he thinks the future of British cycling is rosy. He said: 'In 1958 there was only sort of one of us that could ride the Tour at that time. Now we've got 60 guys that can go into the Tour and give a good performance.'","Brian Robinson, 81, won a stage in 1958 and then repeated the feat in 1959 .

Aimee Copeland's fight against the condition has risen to national attention after the 24-year-old student caught it after cutting herself on a homemade zip-slide into Georgia's Little Tallapoosa River at the beginning of this month. Lana Kuykendall, 36, contracted the condition in South Carolina just hours after giving birth to twins on May 11. Lucky to be alive: Bobby Vaughn watched his infection grow from the size of a peanut to the size of a grapefruit . Two victims: Aimee Copeland, 24, (right) was infected when she was cut after falling from a homemade zipline. Lana Kuykendall (left) came down with the disease after giving birth to twins . Mr Vaughn is currently being treated at Doctors Hospital in Augusta, Georgia, the same place where Miss Copeland is still fighting for her life after doctors were forced to amputate one of her legs, one of her feet and both her hands. Miss Copeland, 24, became infected after she received a cut after falling from a homemade zip-line into the river east of Atlanta. Her father announced on Sunday that she was able to breathe for 10 hours without a respirator, a new milestone in her long road to recovery. Lana Kuykendall, 36, was hospitalized with necrotitis faciitis just hours after she was released from Emory University Hospital after giving birth to twins there. She is in critical but stable condition after undergoing seven operations to remove dead and infected tissue from her leg. Two pounds of flesh: Mr Vaugh had to endure five surgeries, but doctors believe they have removed the infected tissue . Aimee Copeland, pictured, a 24-year-old graduate student at the University of West Georgia, suffered a nasty cut on her thigh when her zipline broke and she plunged into the Little Tallapoosa River, east of Atlanta. Doctors stapled the wound shut, but it became infected with a flesh-eating bacteria on May 4. Surgeons amputated her leg, but by then the disease had spread rapidly. On Saturday, they also amputated her foot and both hands. Now she finally appears to be on the mend, despite being in critical condition. She breathed on her own for 10 hours on Sunday, the first time since being admitted to the hospital. Lana Kuykendall, 36, pictured with her husband, had been home just 13 hours after giving birth to twins at  Emory University Hospital when she noticed a painful spot on her leg last on May 11. Mrs Kuykendall is a paramedic and her husband Darren is a firefighter, so they recognized quickly that something was wrong. Her husband rushed her to Greenville Memorial Hospital in South Carolina. While they waited to be seen, the couple watched in horror as the spot on Mrs Kuykendall's leg grew a quarter of an inch in one hours. She has now undergone seven surgeries to remove the infected tissue and is currently listed in critical condition. Doctors say that despite the strange surge in cases of the rare disease, the three infections are not related. Both Miss Copeland and Mr Vaughn are at Doctors Hospital because it has one of the most renowned burn clinics in the country. Because of the nature of the injuries the flesh-eating bacteria causes, burn doctors have experience removing damaged tissue and repairing it with skin grafts. Mr Vaughn, a landscaper from Cartersville, said he realized immediately after he received the cut that something was wrong. 'I just out of the blue wasn't feeling real well, and I went over and sat in my truck for a minute, and I was feeling real hot, and I started vomiting, you know, so we just stopped for the day,' he told CBS Atlanta. However, when the infection, which began the size of a peanut, grew to the size of a grapefruit, he went to see a doctor. Like Miss Copeland and Mrs Kuyrkendal, Mr Vaughn was rushed into emergency surgery, where doctors cut out as much of the infected tissue as they could. 'I lost a lot of tissue that was in there. I've had a total of about five surgeries,'' Mr Vaugh told the TV station. Vaughn said he's slowly recovering after doctors managed to stem the spread of the rare infection. 'I was told I was just a day or two from being dead or losing entire parts of my body,' he told NBC 11. Necrotizing fasciitis, more commonly known as 'flesh-eating disease', is a rare but extremely vicious bacterial infection. 'Necrotizing' refers to something that causes body tissue to die, and the infection can destroy skin, muscles and fat. The disease develops when the bacteria enters the body, often through a minor cut or scrape. As the bacteria multiply, they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area. Because it is so virulent, the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body. Symptoms include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea. Organ failure and shock are also common complications. Sufferers must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue. Amputation can become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg. Patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up, to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons.","Bobby Vaughn, 32, is recovering at the same hospital as Aimee Copeland, the first victim of necrotitis faciitis .

A trio of Russian, Japanese and U.S. astronauts blasted off aboard a Soyuz capsule yesterday for a four-month mission to the International Space Station. Russian cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko, Nasa astronaut Sunita Williams and Japanese astronaut Akihiko Hoshide launched successfully from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 0240 GMT. They are scheduled to berth early on Tuesday, joining Nasa Flight Engineer Joseph Acaba and Russian cosmonauts Gennady Padalka and Sergei Revin aboard the ISS. We have lift off: The Soyuz TMA-05M rocket launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan yesterday morning carrying three astronauts nearly 250 miles above the Earth to the International Space Station . 'The Soyuz had a very smooth ride into space,' a spokesman for Nasa said during a live broadcast on the agency's television channel. The Soyuz TMA-05M rocket blazed a bright orange trail through cloudy skies above the Kazakh steppe on the first stage of it's journey to the ISS, a $100billion research complex orbiting 240 miles above Earth. Since the retirement of the space shuttles last year, the U.S. is dependent on Russia to fly astronauts to the space station, costing the country $60million per person. Moscow hopes a successful mission will help to restore confidence in its once-pioneering space programme after a string of launch mishaps last year, including the failure of a mission to return samples from the Martian moon Phobos. The previous Soyuz launch on May 15 was delayed by more than a month after an accident during pressure tests damaged the Soyuz crew capsule. There were no such delays with Sunday's launch. Expensive trip: The U.S. is dependent on Russia's Soyuz TMA-05M rockets to carry personnel to the ISS since it scrapped its space shuttle programme last year . 'The most tense, the most difficult part (of the launch) has been successfully implemented,' said Vladimir Popovkin, head of Russian space agency Roscosmos. 'I have just spoken to the crew. They are feeling great,' Russian news agencies quoted Popovkin as saying in Baikonur. 'I have no doubts that all will go according to plan.' Colonel Malenchenko, a 50-year-old cosmonaut on his fifth space voyage, loosened his straps about 20 minutes after blast-off after conducting air pressure checks. Asked by Mission Control how the crew was feeling, he replied: 'Good.' A doll given to him by his daughter dangled from the roof of the capsule.

Explorers: Colonel Malenchenko, left, and Captain Williams, wave to the cameras prior to launch . Captain Williams, 46, and Mr Hoshide, . 43, a civilian engineer, are both on their second space flight and their . first aboard a Soyuz spacecraft. They, along with Colonel Malenchenko, are scheduled to return to Earth in mid-November. The previous crew of three at the ISS returned on July 1. Cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko, NASA astronaut Don Pettit and European Space Agency astronaut Andre Kuipers helped to dock the first privately owned spacecraft during a six-month stint in orbit. Destination space: The International Space Station is a $100billion research complex orbiting 240 miles above Earth . Sunday's launch took place less than three weeks after China's Shenzhou 9 spacecraft returned to Earth, ending a mission that put the country's first woman in space. Although China is far from catching up with the United States and Russia, the Shenzhou 9 marked China's fourth manned space mission since 2003. It comes as budget restraints and shifting priorities have held back U.S. manned space launches.","Russian, Japanese and U.S. crew blasts off successfully .

An Iraqi man arrested at Stansted Airport after taking part in the hijack of an airliner has won the latest round of a 16-year fight to stay in the UK. Mustafa Abdul Hussain - one of the hijackers of a Sudan Airways Airbus which flew into Britain in August 1996 - successfully challenged the Home Office after ministers refused to grant him 'indefinite leave to remain'. A judge said Home Secretary Theresa May should reconsider Mr Hussain’s case, following a High Court hearing in London. Mustafa Abdul Hussain was arrested at Stansted Airport after taking part in the hijack of an airliner in 1996 . Deputy High Court Judge James Dingemans QC said the Home Office decision to refuse Mr Hussain 'indefinite leave to remain' had been 'flawed'. Judge Dingemans said Mr Hussain was part of a group which hijacked the airliner - which had 197 people on board - after it left Sudan on August 27 1996. Mr Hussain, and others, had surrendered at Stansted and claimed asylum, then been arrested. The judge said Mr Hussain was a Shiite Muslim from Basra and his family had suffered at the hands of the Iraqi regime headed by former leader Saddam Hussein. He said Mr Hussain had been accused of refusing to serve in the Iraqi army, detained without trial, tortured and sentenced to death. The judge said Mr Hussain had escaped from Iraq in 1995 and travelled to Sudan. Hijacked passengers, including very young children, leaving the Sudan Airways plane in 1996 . Mr Hussain claimed he had been acting under 'duress' when he carried out the hijacking. He said he had been facing execution in Iraq and feared being seized by Sudanese authorities and returned. Mr Hussain told the judge in a witness statement: '... We had no choice but attempt to leave the country in the manner that we did by hijacking the Sudanese Airbus.' But in 1997, Mr Hussain - and others - were tried and convicted for their respective roles in the hijacking. Mr Hussain was given a five-year prison sentence, Judge Dingemans said. A year later, appeal judges had quashed convictions and no retrial was ordered, he added. Mr Hussain had been released and had . resumed his fight to stay in the UK - and Judge Dingemans today outlined . a series of applications and decisions by officials stretching over . more than a decade. 7 Iraqis and 14 members of their families hi-jacked the plane and demanded to be flown to London specifically to claim political asylum . Judge Dingemans said Mr Hussain was challenging a Home Office decision to refuse indefinite leave taken in October 2011. Mr Hussain complained that others involved in the hijacking had been granted indefinite leave to remain - and argued that he was treated inconsistently. The judge concluded that the Home Office decision was flawed because ministers had ignored 'relevant matters' and because other people involved with the hijacking had been given indefinite leave to remain. Judge Dingemans said the case would be remitted to the Home Office for reconsideration. Home Office ministers had resisted Mr Hussain’s claim and denied 'any unlawfulness' in their decision-making process.","Court calls Home Office decision to refuse Mustafa Abdul Hussain indefinite leave to remain 'flawed'

Vauxhall gave the economy a huge boost yesterday when its car workers were judged to be more efficient, hard-working and flexible than their counterparts in a Germany wrestling with the euro-crisis. The verdict came from American parent company General Motors as it saved Vauxhall’s Ellesmere Port factory in Cheshire from closure and made it the lead plant in Europe to manufacture the next generation Astra from 2015. It means £125million of new investment and 700 extra jobs on top of the 2,100 already secured. Driving forward: American bosses at Vauxhall's US parent company General Motors judged that British workers are more flexible, competitive and efficient - and less militant - than their counterparts in Germany . With the UK enjoying a car exports boom, up to 3,000 more jobs at suppliers could be generated as Vauxhall raises the amount of British-sourced components in the Astra. The plant will build the five-door Astra hatchback plus one variant – either the Sports Tourer estate or the sporty GTC – with production soaring from 140,000 a year now to 160,000 and up to a capacity of 225,000. Vauxhall beat German counterparts thanks to a ‘ground-breaking’ round-the-clock flexibility deal. Busy: Production at the Ellesmere Port factory is to soar from the current 140,000 cars a year to 225,000 . It spells extra shifts, weekend working and the end of the ‘traditional’ long summer shutdown as well as a two-year pay freeze from 2013 followed by two years of real terms increases of RPI inflation plus 1 per cent. The move was hailed by the Prime Minister, business leaders and unions as ‘a vote of confidence’ in British workers and the economy. It marks the latest triumph for the booming UK motor industry which for the first time since 1976 is exporting more cars than it imports. David Cameron praised the ‘team effort’ of employees, unions, managers and ministers in keeping production in the UK. Working for Britain: The announcement will be made today at an event attended by Business Secretary Vince Cable (pictured) Business Secretary Vince Cable, who flew to Detroit in March to put the case for Vauxhall to GM bosses, said it was ‘fantastic news’. He added: ‘The fact that big American car companies are making big investments in Britain is a good signal.’ Vauxhall bosses called it ‘a historic day’. The good news came as motor industry figures showed a near 10 per cent rise in the number of cars built in Britain in April compared with a year ago. The figures were boosted by strong export demand for the likes of Jaguar, Land Rover, Rolls-Royce, Bentley, Mini, Nissan, Honda and Toyota. The turnaround follows significant car industry investment in the UK topping £4billion in 18 months. The General Motors decision on Ellesmere Port means the plant will be exporting Astras to Germany where production of the best-selling small family car will cease altogether. That marks the death-knell for GM’s German factory in Bochum – employing up to 3,200 people – which was competing with the British plant. Ellesmere Port and Gliwice in Poland will now become the only two manufacturing centres for the Astra. The deal also turns on its head the notion that British plants are first in line for closure because their ‘flexibility’ means they are easier and cheaper to shut than those in Germany where the cost of laying off workers is significantly more expensive.","Announcement ends months of nail-biting over future of Cheshire plant .

The suspect was arrested at a basement apartment leased by his brother on Morris Avenue in the Bronx. His last known address was on College Avenue, also in the Bronx. Nunez did not have a steady residence since the shooting as he moved around from home to home of friends and others since the shooting, according to the New York Post. The suspect has a number of felony convictions, including robbery. In a statement, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said: 'Detectives assigned to this case did a masterful job, relentlessly working it to apprehend a suspect who initially appeared so calm, collected, and out of reach.' Video surveillance helped police identify the suspect as it shows a man . in grey sweatpants and a white T-shirt, walking calmly after shooting . his three victims execution style in a parked BMW in Manhattan over what . police suspect was a drug retaliation.

Bloody scene: Three men were found dead in a brand new BMW near Columbia University and the Manhattan School of Music . Authorities said they believe a gunman used a revolver to shoot the victims because no shell casings were found. Police . said they believe the gunman first killed Catalan, sitting on the . right, back seat, by shooting him in the left temple and side. Then . driver Rodriguez died next followed by Suazo, who was sitting in the . front passenger seat as they were both shot behind the ears. Police believe the car had been parked for a maximum of an hour when it was discovered. The high-end vehicle had temporary registration stickers and appeared to be stolen, according to the New York Daily News. Catalan had been arrested at least 10 times for charges ranging from marijuana possession and driving without a license, the Daily News reported. Searching for clues: NYPD officers and detectives investigate inside and around the vehicle; all three victims were shot in the skull . Suazo was arrested late last year for . having 12 pounds of marijuana and loaded guns. Rodriguez served two . years in state prison for gun charges, according to the Daily News. No 911 calls were made to report any shootings and no students at the university claimed to hear any gunfire. 'This was a classic triple assassination,' said one source to the New York Post.’ 'The shooter had to be a cool customer to kill three men so close to him. He was quick and deadly.' One source told the Post that the attack, which happened during the day, was ‘a very bloody scene. 'Shooting three people in a car is extremely loud and the shooter may . have used a silencer,' said a police source. And 'he may have plugged . his ears.' Hours later, it was reported that 'blood was still dripping' from the car as it sat outside the university's Knox Hall. Police blocked off a wide area around the triple homicide after the bodies were found. Disturbing the peace: The three men were found on W. 122nd Street near Claremont Avenue, a generally quiet area within Morningside Heights . Addressing: NYPD Deputy Commissioner speaks to reporters about the bloody crime . ‘Both men in the front seat were wearing white T-shirts, both drenched in blood,’ said a police spokesman. The police were alerted around 6.30pm by a man walking by the scene who saw the two men in the front seat of the car appeared to be dead. Sources told the Post that they weren’t believed to have been students of the music school or at Columbia. Students in the area were badly shaken by the incident.

Users of Google Plus, the search giant's much-hyped social network, visit the service for a mere three minutes a month, according to figures from Comscore. The same figures show that Facebook users log in for an average of six to seven hours per month. The figures add to the growing evidence that Google's social network is a dud, despite official figures from Google showing 90 million subscribers. New figures from Comscore claim that PC users of Google's Plus social network spend a mere three minutes per month on the site, in contrast to seven hours for Facebook users . Google's Plus social network has 90 million registered users, according to the search giant's official figures . Britney Spears has two million followers on Google Plus - but others report that the site is less useful for reaching out to the public . Google claims that 60 per cent of Plus users engage with the site daily. But critics claim that Google's figures are misleading, as Plus works within other Google services such as YouTube and Search, as well as various apps on Android phones. The new Comscore statistics, reported by the Wall Street Journal, paint a very different picture - although they apply only to PC users, rather than mobile users. 'Nobody wants another social network right now,' Brian Solis, an analyst at social-media advisory firm Altimeter Group told the Wall Street journal. 'Google hasn't communicated what the value of Google+ is.' Some public figures have found the network useful - Britney Spears, for instance, has two million followers on Google Plus. But chip maker Intel said that its Google Plus page has a mere 360,000 followers, while nine million people follow Intel on Facebook. The search giant was widely criticised for the 'Search Plus Your World' feature which added 'personalised' Google Plus results into Google searches. Google is under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission for using its dominance in search to promote other, less successful services. Google new 'Search plus your world' feature has come under fire from Twitter's general counsel for prioritising results from Google's Plus social network . The Next Web says, 'For all its features, Google+ may simply have come into the picture too late. While it has a buzzing and active photography community engaging with one another, if comScore’s figures are to be believed – there might not be much beyond that.'

Jerry Sandusky's adopted son revealed to police he had been sexually abused by the convicted pedophile - but worried he would be charged with perjury for not admitting the attacks under oath to a grand jury. Matt Sandusky, now 33, reportedly can be heard on a 25-minute recording admitting to officers that he had been abused by the man who adopted him when he was a teenager. Jerry Sandusky, was taken to Centre County Correctional Facility in Pennsylvania after being convicted of 45 out of 48 charges of child sex abuse on Friday. Victim in the family: Matt Sandusky, who was adopted by the convicted pedophile Jerry Sandusky (right), recently came forward to say he had also been abused . Karl Rominger, part of Jerry Sandusky's defense team, told ABC: 'As a general rule it's a tape of Matt (Sandusky) making the allegations. 'I don't feel comfortable going into specifics about what he says, but I'll say that he is an alleged victim, so that will tell you some.' The young man hesitated to reveal the horrific abuse he was also allegedly a victim of because he had previously said under oath that no abuse had taken place. However Jerry Sandusky's attorney questioned the veracity of the adopted son's claims, saying that Matt's story appeared to have come back 'all of a sudden'. Matt Sandusky is one of Jerry Sandusky's six adopted children with wife Dottie. Convicted paedophile: Jerry Sandusky is escorted from the courthouse in handcuffs after being found guilty in his sexual abuse trial at the Centre County Courthouse in Bellefonte . His lawyers, Andrew Shubin and Justine . Andronici, issued a statement on Thursday naming Matt Sandusky and . saying that the 33-year-old had been prepared to testify on behalf of . prosecutors at his father's sex abuse trial. The statement says Matt Sandusky is 'a victim of Jerry Sandusky's abuse,' but did not go into specifics. Secrets: Matt Sanduskt, pictured as a teenager, revealed he had been molested last week . The revelation of the tape came as Jerry Sandusky still insisted through a lawyer yesterday that he is not guilty of sexually abusing children. The case rocked the Penn State community following the defense coordinator's arrest in November. The ensuing scandal led to the firing of Sandusky's former boss - Hall of Fame coach Joe Paterno - and the university's president, while forcing a re-examination of the role that college administrators played in reporting abuse allegations. A juror who voted to convict the retired Penn State assistant coach said she hoped the verdict would help his accusers heal. The jury found the testimony of the eight victims who took the witness stand compelling, Ann Van Kuren said yesterday. Jurors weighed the accounts and evidence diligently before finding Sandusky guilty last week of 45 counts for sexually abusing 10 boys over 15 years, she said. She expressed empathy for the eight men who offered emotional and explicit testimony. 'I really feel for the victims and any other victims that are out there that haven't come forward,' Van Kuren said. 'That all of them need to heal. I'm hoping that this trial, with this verdict, will help them heal.' Sandusky, 68, is under observation at . the Centre County jail, where he is being kept away from other inmates . pending a psychological review that will help determine the next step . toward his sentencing in about three months. 'He's defiant and wants the truth to . be told. He wants people to know that he's not guilty,' said defense . lawyer Karl Rominger, who visited his incarcerated client on Monday. Preparing an appeal: Joe Amendola, defense lawyer for Sandusky, talks to the media outside court after Sandusky was found guilty and charged with 45 counts of sexual abuse . Judge John Cleland ordered county probation officers to evaluate whether Sandusky is a sexual predator, a finding that could factor into his prison placement. Sex offenders are required to undergo treatment while in prison, so if deemed a predator,  Sandusky would likely be sent to a facility with such a program. Sandusky, who has been placed under a suicide watch, said he doesn't want to kill himself and wants to get the separate psychological examination done so that he can receive visits from his friends and family, Rominger said. 'He's fine but he's just not been evaluated,' the lawyer said. 'He is very disappointed to be in prison. He is anxious to get out of this suicide watch.' Rominger added that Sandusky told him: 'If I have to keep sitting in this room for another three or four days without being able to talk to anybody, I might start to need help at that point.' The state investigation into Sandusky didn't begin until after the ex-coach was barred from a high school in 2009, when a mother complained about the former coach. At the time, Governor Tom Corbett was the state attorney general. Charges were filed in November 2011. Sandusky has repeatedly maintained his innocence. He will likely die in prison, given mandatory minimum sentencing requirements. The conviction is just the start of possibly years of legal proceedings over the case. Besides appeals, there remains an active investigation into Sandusky by the state attorney general's office, as well as a federal investigation. Corbett said Penn State trustees are still awaiting the results of an internal investigation by former FBI director Louis Freeh into the school's handling of the Sandusky case. The university could also face a wave of new lawsuits. An hour after the verdict Friday night, Penn State said in a statement it was inviting victims to 'participate in a program to facilitate the resolution of claims against the university arising out of Mr. Sandusky's conduct'. The school said it sought to address victims' concerns privately, expeditiously and fairly. Asked to clarify, school spokesman Dave LaTorre said the university won't discuss details about litigation or how much money might be set aside for potential settlements, and declined to comment further.","Matt Sandusky, now 33, one of convicted pedophile's six adopted children .

"By . Deborah Arthurs . PUBLISHED: . 12:43 EST, 24 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:03 EST, 24 August 2012 . Cheryl Barrier thought she had the perfect marriage. With a handsome husband and two young daughters, her life was complete. But just two years ago, her life was turned upside down when her husband Ashley discovered that he was gay. At first Cheryl, 30, felt as though her life had crumbled around her. But instead of being angry, Cheryl found the inner strength to forgive her former husband - and even helped him to find a boyfriend. Ashley, 27, and Cheryl, 30, were happily married until Ashley realised he was gay . Now, Ashley and Nathan are happily married - while Cheryl is regarded as a close family friend. The three, who appeared on the This Morning sofa to discuss their unusual relationship, say that they are now one big happy family. Cheryl, who many would have forgiven for presuming her five year marriage to Ashley had been a sham, says she never had an inkling her husband was gay. 'I never had a clue,' she says now. 'There was never a time when I thought he was effeminate, or gay. 'I never thought for a minute he was curbing his instinct.' Even more surprising is the fact that Ashley says that he didn't know either. So was it just a road to Damascus transformation? 'Yes,' says Ashley. 'I never had an inkling. 'AlI I ever wanted was kids and a wife. I’ve always said that if I’d known, I wouldn’t have married and had my . children. 'But I don’t regret that for a minute. Back then, I loved it – . we were very happy together.' The two met when Ashley was 19 and Cheryl was 23 through their siblings. It was love at first sight and the pair married quickly. Now Cheryl, Ashley and his new husband Nathan, 29, regard their unusual situation as just 'one big happy family' 'There were three dates that we could get married on - and one of them was a month away, Ashley recalls. 'We went for that one - we only had a month to plan our wedding.' The two were blissfully happy, until one night when the two decided to watch an adult film together. The pornographic scenes of a heterosexual couple gave way to some scenes involving two men engaged in a sex act together. 'As I came across it, I didn't turn it off,' Ashley says. 'At first, it was just that it didn't annoy or repulse me. I was shocked to find I liked it,' he says. Further on, as I kept going, I realised I really did like it.' At that point, Ashley decided he must be bisexual. Realising her husband had made a major discovery, Cheryl urged her Ashley to explore that area of his life. 'We spoke about his feelings,' Cheryl says. 'It wasn't something that happened overnight. I said to Ashley, ""you have to experience that part of your life. I don't want you to live a lie with me and the children.' Then, Ashley was still under the impression he was bisexual - but decided to do as Cheryl suggested and look for a boyfriend. 'You can't control when that 'something' comes out,' Ashley says. 'I was as shocked as Cheryl. Nathan, right, came out to his family when he was 13, and says he isn't at all fazed by the unusual set-up he has with Ashley and Cheryl . 'You don't just wake up one day and go, ""I'm gay!"". It happened gradually. 'We talked in depth about it,' says Cheryl. 'It’s not something we light-heartedly skimmed over.’ Remarkably, Cheryl says she holds no anger towards the man who left her for another man. 'Anger? ‘I have gay relationships in my family already,' she says. 'My brother is gay as well. We are used to dealing with gays in the family, it’s accepted.' Cheryl and Ashley admit that telling the children was the hardest part. 'We spoke about it, then it came to, ""How do we tell the kids?’ 'I’ve lost you as a husband but I want to keep you as a friend' 'We both dealt with it a mature way,' Ashley says - adding that Cheryl showed what a good friend she could be. For Cheryl's part, she says she does not grieve for the husband she lost. 'I'd rather have him as a good friend,' she says. 'We need to keep relationship natural and good for children.' 'We used to send each other cards – I’ve lost you as a husband but I want to keep you as a friend,’ Ashley adds. Soon after the couple split, Ashley met Nathan and the two were married within the year. Ashley says he knew Nathan was the one as soon as they met - but that telling Cheryl was difficult. ‘I knew he was the one, but to tell my ex-wife was the final bit. To tell her, I've moved on, I've met someone who is The One - that was hard,' he says. For his part, Nathan, who came out to his family when he was 13, is open-minded about the unusual situation. He says he was brought up with a big family, so the fact that Ashley had children - and a wife - didn't perturb him at all. So is Nathan at all worried that Ashley could return to heterosexual past? 'At the beginning, we were all so close. In the back of my mind I thought he could go back with Cheryl again. But once we had our Civil Partnership I knew. 'But we are all still very close.' Ashley says that by appearing on This Morning, he hopes to help other men who might be in the same situation. 'It's not about not being true to yourself,' he says. 'Some people are ashamed, and I want them to see how well we work as a family unit. We work great together. Hopefully people can see how accepting we are.'","Cheryl and Ashley Barrier were happily married with two children when gay pornography sparked unfamiliar feelings for Ashley .
