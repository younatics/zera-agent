Warren Hill was scheduled to die via lethal injection on Monday but was granted a third stay of execution . A judge dramatically stayed a Georgia . inmate's scheduled execution for a third time on Monday, after . attorneys raised questions involving the state's supply of execution . drugs. Lawyers for Warren Lee Hill, 52, have long argued that he is 'mentally disabled' and therefore shouldn't be executed. The lethal injection was halted just three hours before it was due to be carried out. The state maintains that . the defense failed to meet its burden of proving beyond a reasonable . doubt that Hill is mentally disabled. The death-row prisoner was sentenced . to death in 1990 for the lethal beating of fellow inmate Joseph . Handspike with a board studded with nails to the distress of other . inmates. At the time of . the murder, Hill was already serving a life sentence for the 1986 . murder of his girlfriend, Myra Wright, who he shot 11 times. According to Hill's lawyers the judge has now planned a hearing for Thursday. As reported by the Guardian, the attorneys for the inmate argued that Georgia's new Lethal Injection Secrecy Law violates his rights. The legislation has come into being after controversy and uncertainty about how the state imports the drugs used for lethal injections. The pharmaceuticals are currently the subject of a growing international boycott. Hill's lawyer Brian Kammer said he was relieved by the latest decision. 'At this time, there is far too much we do not know about how the state intends to proceed in this, the most extreme act a government can take against a citizen,' Kammer said. Rally: Lawyers and supporters of Warren Hill have argued that Hill is mentally disabled and therefore shouldn't be executed. This protest on Monday in Atlanta called for alternatives to the death penalty in Georgia . This wasn't the first time Hill's scheduled execution has been halted by a . challenge to Georgia's execution method. Last July, a previous execution . date was put on hold by an earlier challenge to the state's plan to . change from a three-drug injection to a single dose of pentobarbital. The . state Supreme Court later authorized the execution to proceed and Hill came within 30 minutes of the execution in February. It was then halted again so courts could consider claims Hill is mentally . disabled. That stay was lifted in April and the execution rescheduled . for Monday. On February 19 Hill was set to be executed at 7 p.m. Tuesday night, but shortly before the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted the stay on claims by Hill that he was mentally disabled and thus ineligible for execution, Kammer said. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued the ruling for Warren Lee Hill as corrections officials prepared his lethal injection for later in the evening. Reprieve: Demonstrators celebrate the stay of execution for Warren Hill, condemned for a 1990 killing of a fellow inmate . Earlier in the day, the state parole board, the Supreme Court of Georgia and the U.S. Supreme Court had all declined to stop the execution. 'We are greatly relieved that the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals has stayed the execution of Warren Hill, a person with mental retardation. 'All the doctors who have examined Mr. Hill are unanimous in their diagnosis of mental retardation,' defense attorney Brian Kammer said in an email. 'I think we were within about a half hour of the execution.' Hill has received support from various activists and from former President Jimmy Carter and his wife Rosalynn. 'Georgia should not violate its own prohibition against executing individuals with serious diminished capacity,' President Carter said in a statement. Clemency: Members of the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles prepare to hear a clemency hearing for Hill last July - which they turned down . A fierce legal battle raged over the death penalty sentence of Hill in February. Despite originally testifying for the state, three doctors who claimed that Hill was not mentally disabled dramtically changed their minds. Hill’s lawyers have continually argued that their client has had mental issues for the duration of his incarceration, and are doing everything in their power to spare his life. Authorities said that Hill, who was already serving a life sentence for the murder of his girlfriend, Maya Wright four years earlier, attacked Handspike again and again with a nail embedded in a piece of plank. Handspike died of his injuries. However, the Handspike family has publicly declared that they do not agree with Hill’s execution. Hill’s lethal injection would have gone directly against the 2002 case, Atkins v. Virginia, which ruled that Daryl Atkins was ‘mentally retarded’ and was not of sound mind, and therefore could not be sentenced to death. Dr Thomas Sachy wrote in a February affidavit: ‘Having reviewed my earlier evaluation results and the far more extensive materials from the record of this case, I believe that my judgement that Mr Hill did not meet the criteria for mild mental retardation was in error.’ Watchful: A corrections officer stands guard with a shotgun on the main road into the Georgia Diagnostic Prison in Jackson, Georgia last July after a 30-day stay of execution was announced for condemned murderer Hill . The other doctors concede and claimed their evaluations of Hill in 2000 were ‘rush jobs,’ according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The state said that Hill’s lawyers failed to prove ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’ that the man is mentally disabled. Outrage: Troy Davis was the last Georgia inmate to be executed in the state; his 2011 death was highly controversial . Lauren Kane, a spokesperson for the state Attorney General’s Office, declined comment, at the time. Hill was originally scheduled to be executed in June, but the Supreme Court allowed him a stay of execution while his attorneys pursued a challenge based on the state’s changing of execution method. Hill is among three Georgia inmates on Death Row fighting for a court order that would prevent the state from using a drug to execute them without a doctor’s prescription first. Hill, along with Andrew Allen Cook and Marcus Wellons, argue that the Georgia Department of Corrections’ use of the drug without a doctor’s prescription violates the federal Controlled Substances Act. Even if the court finds him mentally disabled, Hill would still spend the rest of his life in prison, the Journal-Constitution says. The case has stirred a national outcry of those believing Hill to be mentally unwell. If he is executed, it will be the first carried-out execution in the state since the 2011 death of Troy Davis. At the time, Davis’ conviction and condemnation drew fury, as many believed that Davis was the victim of mistaken identity in the murder of Burger King guard Mark MacPhail in 1989. Prosecutors and MacPhail's family said they were certain Davis was guilty and that justice was served. Prison officials also provided an audio recording and transcript of his last words, which he used to again proclaim his innocence and urge his supporters to ""continue to fight this fight."" Davis was notified of the execution date on Sept. 7, and a day later he was asked to make a last meal request. He scrawled a response in big letters: ""None. Will Be Fasting!"" According to figures collected by Amnesty International, the U.S. was the only country within the G8 to carry out executions in 2011.","Warren Lee Hill was granted another stay of execution only three hours before he was due to face a lethal injection .

The stepdaughter of Pablo Picasso says more than 400 pieces of art by the Spanish master - worth more than £1million - were stolen from her house. Lithographs, sketches and watercolours were taken over two years from their store at Catherine Hutin-Blay's home and she suspects that a man, posing as a handyman, is responsible. Hutin-Blay, the daughter of Picasso's second wife Jacqueline, only discovered the artworks were missing when she was contacted by The Picasso Administration. Catherine Hutin-Blay, the daughter of Picasso's second wife Jacqueline (pictured together), said more than 400 pieces by the Spanish master were stolen from her home over two years . She suspects a handyman she employed was a con artist who copied her key and removed the valuable works over two years from filing cabinets where they were stored at the Chateau de Vauvenargues (pictured) The organisation, run by the heirs of the Spanish artist, had seen one of the pieces she owned for sale at a Paris gallery. It was only then that she checked the filing cabinets where she stored the pieces she inherited from her mother and realised the scale of the theft. She believes they were taken between 2005 and 2007. Hutin-Blay discovered the thefts in 2011 but only announced it last week. She told Le Parisian: 'I went to the filing cabinet to check that the artworks were still ther and they were no longer there. That is what triggered everything.' Picasso is the artist who has more works registered stolen then anyone else . Hutin-Blay, 65, who lives in the Chateau de Vauvenargues, in Provence, where her mother and Picasso are buried. She says the 'handyman' also stole valuable artwork from a neighbour Sylvie Baltazart-Eon, the daughter of Picassoo's art dealer Aime Maeght. Work by Kandinsky, Giacometti and Joan Miro, as well as other Picasso works, were also stolen from Baltazart-Eon. Huton-Blay . told Le Parisian that she believe the handyman got a key cut to her . house while working as a gardner and over time stole the artworks. She . told the French newspaper: 'The art theft squad have been charming and . they know a lot about art. I'm lucky in that I photographed everything . before the thefts but I fear they may have been sold abroad.' Just 22 pieces have been recovered. A survey last year found Picasso is the artist who has more works stolen than anyone else. The Spanish master had 1,147 paintings registered as stolen, missing or disputed, but it is not clear if these included Hutin-Blay's stolen work.","Catherine Hutin-Blay suspects a former handyman took the work .

A golf fanatic with a love of unusual golf balls has taken his passion to extremes and amassed what is believed to be the biggest collection of unique balls in the world. Most golfers own plenty, but devoted Dick Falenski, 74, has amassed more than 36,000 differing sorts which he crams into his home - aptly located on Fairway Drive. He collected his first ball more than 50 years ago and has now got so many he has to store them in specially-made coffee tables, gumball machines, and Victorian bathtubs in his basement. Golfing fanatic Dick Falenski has collected more than 36,000 golf balls in his lifetime . Mr Falenski's collection is so vast that he has custom-made furniture to store them, but they still spill out . Mr Falenski's incredible collection features balls that belonged to U.S. presidents such as Bill Clinton, sports stars like Michael Jordan and others stamped with famous courses from around the world. The balls - some of which date back almost 200 years - have been gathered from 34 different countries with one of the earliest from St Andrews, Scotland, known as the 'Home of Golf', where he first played in 1965. Rory McIlroy fan Mr Falenski also has balls from other Open venues such as Troon and Turnberry but is missing one in his collection - Muirfield, where the 2013 Open will take place this weekend.

Canadian researchers have found that sounds cause players to overestimate the number of times they win while playing on slot machines. A modern slot machine has an average of 400 sound effects . Winning sounds on slot machines make gambling more exciting, a study has claimed. Canadian researchers have found that sounds also cause players to overestimate the number of times they win while playing on slot machines. The study, from the University of Waterloo, observed that sound has always been an integral part of the slot machine playing experience. Since the early 1900s, players have been rewarded with a ringing bell every time they have a winning combination, but today's slot machines have an average of 400 sound effects. Modern machines allow players to wager on multiple lines but when they spin and lose, the machine goes quiet. When they spin and win more than their wager, they hear a celebratory song, according to the study published in Springer's Journal of Gambling Studies. Interestingly, when a gambler spins and wins back less than their wager, they still hear the celebratory songs despite the fact that overall they lost money on these spins. Researcher Mike Dixon and his colleagues set out to find if these celebratory sounds could hide the fact that players were losing money. They measured 96 gamblers' physiological responses to various slot machine game outcomes – wins, losses and losses disguised as wins – with and without sound during play. One of the responses during play was sweaty palms, which increases skin conductance, which is a measure of arousal. The gamblers played two sessions on a slot machine simulator. In one session, both wins and losses disguised as wins were accompanied by rolling sounds and celebratory winning jingles, as well as visual feedback, much like in a typical casino. In a second session, the sounds were turned off and players only received visual feedback. Researchers measured 96 gamblers' physiological responses to various slot machine game outcomes - wins, losses and losses disguised as wins - with and without sound during play. Sound influenced the overall levels of arousal of players. More players got sweatier palms in the session with sound than in the session without sound . The researchers measured the participants' skin conductance and heart rate responses to the various outcomes. At the end of play, the gamblers were asked which session they preferred and why. They also estimated how many spins they had won back more than they wagered. Sound influenced the overall levels of arousal of players. Skin conductance responses were significantly greater in the session with sound than in the session without sound. Players also rated the noisy session as more arousing than the quiet session. The study found that the majority of players preferred the playing session where wins were accompanied by sounds. This suggests that not only do sounds make playing more exciting, players enjoy this extra level of excitement. Mr Dixon also found that sounds also contributed to players overestimating their number of wins. Gamblers studied rated the noisy session as more arousing than the quiet session. Just under a quarter of the players overestimated their wins when sounds were played, compared with 15 per cent when they were rewarded with visual feedback only . While this overestimation occurred both in the quiet and noisy sessions, it was significantly higher in the session with sound. Just under a quarter of the gamblers overestimated their wins when sounds were played, compared with 15 per cent when they were rewarded with visual feedback only. The researchers believe that sounds may form an integral part of 'the disguise' in losses disguised as wins, causing players to think that they have won more often during a playtime session than they actually have. Mr Dixon said: 'Although sounds may have contributed to players' enjoyment of the game, sound may also lead to an overestimation of winning. 'Both of these effects may contribute to gambling problems, such as misbeliefs about the true chances of winning, and persistence that some players experience when playing slot machines.'","Study shows that sounds cause gamblers to overestimate the number of times they win while playing on slot machines .

Low ratings: Paul Hollywood's attempt to break into the lucrative U.S. TV business is on the rocks after his American Baking Competition flopped . Paul Hollywood’s attempts to conquer America appear to have fallen flat. The star baker had hoped to replicate the success of The Great British Bake Off with a U.S. version of the show. But The American Baking Competition, which was disliked by critics, attracted just 5.8million fans at its height, losing its time slot. Just 4.6million tuned in to the finale. As a result bosses at the CBS network have not committed to a second series. It is believed Hollywood, 47, had hoped to return to the US in the autumn for another run of the show to spend more time with 34-year-old Mexican pastry chef Marcela Valladolid. But a TV insider said speculation over their relationship and the breakdown of his 15-year marriage to wife Alexandra, 49, with whom he has an 11-year-old son, had not helped matters. 'Hollywood’s chances of becoming a star are on the rocks. He has not made an impression like Gordon Ramsay or Simon Cowell did in their first show,' the source said. 'The American Bake Off was not liked by critics and also the viewers tuned out at the end, which has made CBS bosses non-plussed about its future. 'They hoped that the show would become a flagship for the channel with Hollywood doing for them what Gordon Ramsay does for the rival Fox network. 'But with the marriage split, the PR drive for the show went askew and both Marcela and Hollywood stayed away from a heavy publicity drive. 'It certainly hurt the show and now they might duck PR again if it gets a second chance, which doesn’t help their cause.' At the weekend Mr Hollywood’s tearful wife told the Daily Mail there was no hope of a reconciliation and that she was divorcing him. Mr Hollywood moved out of his Kent marital home in May amid rumours he had started dating Miss Valladolid. The news created a string of negative headlines and days before The American Baking Competition launched in the US. Wife swap: An insider said speculation over Hollywood's relationship with Marcela Valladolid, left, 34, and the breakdown of his 15-year marriage to wife Alexandra, right, 49, with whom he has a son, had not helped . Mr Hollywood and Miss Valladolid have never spoken about their relationship but a few weeks ago the baker tweeted a picture of an empty plate having apparently enjoyed a romantic dinner date with the mother-of-one, who has also split from her husband Fausto Gallardo. He added the caption: ‘Great meal. Ahhh x’ Hours later, his  wife posted a message to more than 2,000 followers, saying: ‘I have to say, if I went out on a romantic evening I’d be gazing lovingly at my date, not tweeting my empty plate... What do you think girls?’ Plenty of chemistry: But the American Baking Competition starring Hollywood and Miss . Valladolid attracted just 5.8million fans at its . height, losing its time slot. Just 4.6million tuned in to the finale . Although she tweets under the name ‘Hollywood wife’, the mother-of-one has changed her Twitter profile to say that she is ‘soon to belong to The First Wives Club’.

The son of former MI6 chief Sir John Scarlett told yesterday how he fought single-handedly to save dying comrades after an ambush by a rogue Afghan policeman. The man had opened fire with an assault rifle from a checkpoint watchtower as the troops filed through a 3ft by 10ft passage, an inquest heard. Warrant Officer Class 2 Leonard ‘Pez’ Thomas, 44, and Guardsmen Craig Roderick, 22, and Apete Tuisovurua, 28, were fatally wounded. Their commander Captain John Scarlett, Sir John’s son, was shot in the thigh as he fought to save his injured Army comrades. He and combat medic Lance Corporal Stephen Shaw, who pulled him to safety, were both later awarded the Military Cross for gallantry. Dramatic details of the ‘green-on-blue’ massacre in a violent part of Helmand Province were today described to the hearing at Oxford Coroners’ Court. The soldiers were on patrol on July 1 last year when they were sent to Checkpoint Kamparack Pul in Nahr-e-Saraj to organise a shura, or meeting, for local police chiefs and civilians. When the troops arrived at the base it was virtually empty with just one uniformed policeman on duty. He explained his commander was on his way to the compound but after waiting for nearly 40 minutes the British soldiers decided to leave. Captain Scarlett, a Coldstream Guard who was part the UK police advisory team, told the inquest: ‘I informed the sentry we couldn’t wait any longer and that we would be in touch.’ He said the policeman came down from the watchtower, known as a sangar, to talk face-to-face, then returned to his post. Captain Scarlett said: ‘As we departed we lined up in single file. The interpreter and I had left the compound and the other four were inside when we heard gunfire from the sangar. ‘Initially we thought he was firing towards a threat from the outside. The realisation came quite quickly that wasn’t what was happening. The officer ran back inside the checkpoint to try to rescue his stricken comrades. His rifle jammed but he blazed away with his pistol, firing a total of about 30 rounds at the tower. Three soldiers died in the attack by a rogue Afghan policeman, who opened fire from a watchtower in Helmand Province last July . He said: ‘I could see the shooter through my sights, shooting in our direction. I was shot in the leg.’ He was pulled to safety by combat medic L/Cpl Shaw, of the Royal Army Medical Corps, who had to crawl to avoid the bullets which killed his comrades. Lance Corporal Shaw dashed outside to tell waiting comrades what was happening. British Army Mastiff and Husky armoured vehicles rammed the closed main gate and blitzed the watchtower with machinegun fire while retrieving their stricken colleagues. WO2 Thomas, of Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, from the Royal Corps of Signals, and Gdsm Roderick, from Cardiff, and Gdsm Tuisovurua, from Fiji, both of the 1st Battalion the Welsh Guards, were pronounced dead at Camp Bastion. Sir John Scarlett was head of MI6 from 2004 to 2009. He worked on the controversial dossier that backed the Iraq war . The killer, named as Ziarahman, who was armed with an AK47 assault rifle, was shot and captured alive. Capt Scarlett told the inquest that the rogue policeman was not wearing body armour when they arrived at the checkpoint. But he said: ‘As we left, he was. It triggered something in my mind but not enough. In hindsight he was getting ready to engage us. ‘With hindsight there are all sorts of things that appear to be off but at the time it didn’t seem suspicious. ‘We had spent time with him and not felt threatened. I couldn’t see any way in which we could have prevented what happened.’ Coroner Alison Thompson told the hearing in Oxford: 'These men were shot in a position where they had no ability to retaliate. They believed they were walking out of a situation where there was no risk. 'I’m satisfied from the evidence before me that there is nothing to suggest that the policeman was acting other than on his own. 'It is tempting to think this was part of a much bigger picture but certainly I have got no evidence from which I could properly make a finding that there was anybody else involved.' She said she could find no meaning to what happened, adding: 'I have heard from the witnesses they had no inkling that anything like this was going to happen. 'There’s no evidence before me there was any particular warning sign.' She recorded verdicts that each of the soldiers had been unlawfully killed while on active service overseas. She was making no formal recommendations as she accepted lessons had been learned and new measures taken to reduce the risk of similar incidents occuring again.","Captain John Scarlett was shot in the thigh in Helmand Province last July by Afghan policeman .

Get to work Grandma: New research carried out in France suggests that delaying retirement can make people less likely to develop dementia . It is the dream of many to be successful enough in their professional life to retire early and enjoy their golden years in a splendid state of carefree relaxation. But new research suggests that delaying retirement can make people less likely to develop dementia. A French study believed to be the largest ever of its kind found someone retiring at 65 was about 15 per cent less likely to develop the condition that someone retiring at 60. The findings back up previous studies suggesting that continued intellectual stimulation and mental engagement may ward off the tragic cognitive decline caused by Alzheimer's and similar illnesses. They suggest professional activity may be an important determinant of intellectual stimulation and mental engagement, which are thought to be potentially protective against dementia. Study author Carole Dufoil and her team at the Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherché Médicale (INSERM) analysed the health and insurance records of more than 429,000 self-employed workers. Analyses showed that the risk of being diagnosed with dementia was lower for each year of working longer. Even after excluding workers who had dementia diagnosed within the 5 years following retirement, the results remained unchanged and highly significant, the researchers said in a release. 'Our data show strong evidence of a significant decrease in the risk of developing dementia associated with older age at retirement, in line with the ""use it or lose it"" hypothesis,' said Dr Dufouil. 'The patterns were even stronger when we focused on more recent birth cohorts.' Around 35million people worldwide suffer from dementia, with Alzheimer's the most common type, CBS News reported. The illness is expected to become a particularly acute problem in Western nations in coming decades as members of the baby boom generation reach their dotage. But with retirement ages being delayed in many countries worried about the impact of so many new pensioners on social security safety nets, it appears it could have the unintended consequence of actually keeping them healthy for longer. Tragic cognitive decline: An elderly woman suffering from Alzheimer's disease in a residential care home. Around 35million people worldwide suffer from dementia, with Alzheimer's the most common type . Dr Dufouil, director of research in neuroepidemiology at INSERM, said: 'Professional activity may be an important determinant of intellectual stimulation and mental engagement, which are thought to be potentially protective against dementia. 'As countries around the world respond to the aging of their populations, our results highlight the importance of maintaining high levels of cognitive and social stimulation throughout work and retired life, and they emphasize the need for policies to help older individuals achieve cognitive and social engagement.' The researchers presented their findings today at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Boston, Massachusetts.","Those retiring at 65 are 15 per cent less likely to suffer from the condition than those retiring at 60, finds authoritative French study ."

Thousands of Indians yesterday rushed to telegram offices to send souvenir messages marking the last day of the country's telegram service. The last-minute rush in messages brought the 162-year-old service, the last major commercial telegram operation to a close. The service, which was set up in the heyday of the British Raj, sent around 5,000 telegrams a day and employed 998 people . in its 75 offices. Last-minute: There was a surge in the number of customers in Indian Telegraph Offices yesterday. Here, the central office in Ahmedabad is overrun with customers . Piece of history: Indians queued for a memento of the unique 162-year service that was the main form of communication in the days before the internet and mobile phones . Stamped out: An employee stamps a message at Katchehri telegraph office, in Allahabad on the final day of the service . All stop: A worker taps out a telegram at the Central Telegraph Office in New Delhi. India disbanded the world's last major telegram service on Sunday . With one final STOP at the end, the . Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL), India’s state-run telegram service, . wired its final message on Sunday. At its peak in 1985, the service relayed some 60 million messages every year and employed 12,000 people. Today the remaining customers consist mainly of local government offices sending administrative messages to remote areas which are still not covered by the phone networks. Back in the days of the British Raj, the telegram service proved an absolutely vital means of control for a colonial power ruling over a vast expanse of land. Origins: A team of workers lays the underwater cable that stretched from India to Britain in 1870 . Mechanics: A museum employee in Bhopal with an 1837 telegraphy machine of the type used in the early years . The first 27-mile stretch of line was laid by the East India Company between Calcutta and Diamond Harbour as early as 1851. To cope with India's stifling heat and humidity, the cables used were far thicker than those in Europe and North America and were covered with a layer of cloth and pitch to keep out the dust and monsoon rains. The network grew exponentially. One of the most famous early messages was . sent to Lord Dalhousie in Calcutta in April 1852 announcing the fall of . Rangoon during the during the second Anglo-Burmese war. Communication: Mahatma Gandhi, who led the struggle for Indian independence, relied heavily on telegrams to rally support and appeal for vital funds . And when Indian troops rebelled in 1857, sparking a widespread uprising against colonial rule, the telegram is credited with playing a crucial role in helping the British mobilise and regain control. After the uprising was quelled, Lord Dalhousie famously credited the telegram as having 'saved India for the British Empire'. BK Syngal, former Managing director of VSNL, which had a mandate to send telegrams overseas until 2002, told the Hindustan Times: 'The telegraph allowed the British to relay information across large parts of India in almost real time. 'This leap in communications proved decisive'. In 1870, underwater cables were laid between India and Britain providing a vital link between Westminster and Britain's largest and most valuable colony. But like many innovations introduced by the British, the telegram was quickly adopted by Indians for their own use. Mahatma Gandhi, who led the struggle for Indian independence, relied heavily on telegrams to rally support and appeal for vital funds. And during the partition of the subcontinent in 1947, the telegram would prove a vital link between families and friends at opposite ends of the country. Santosh Sharma, who sixty-six years ago left Pakistan for New Delhi, remembers how she then used telegrams to keep in touch with her loved ones. 'Crossing the border meant risking your own life,' she told AFP, 'At that time the telegram was the only way to keep families informed, give speedy updates and reunite.' Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru also relied on the telegram famously sending British Prime Minister Clement Attlee a message to request help from London when Pakistani troops invaded Kashmir. R.K. Rai, a retired telegraph operator in . New Delhi, remembers the service in its pomp as hundreds of workers . crashed out the dots and dashes of Morse Code used on telegraph . machines. Plea for help: Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru (right) famously sent British Prime Minister Clement . Attlee (left) a message to request help from London when Pakistani . troops invaded Kashmir . He told AFP: 'The whole office sounded like a factory,' he remembers. 'Sometimes we felt we knew every significant detail of our customer's lives. 'The word privacy did not exist in anyone's dictionary then.' The service continued to be invaluable up until the 1990s with the advent of mobile communications. Today Raj's old office, a colonial style building in the centre of capital barely sends out 10 messages a day and will soon be closed. He added: 'The new technology is so fast it just surprises me. Communication is a game of speed, the fastest will always win the game. 'Eventually the telegraph system had to face defeat.'","India's state-run BSNL network is the world's last major telegram service .

Footage of Paula Deen openly admitting to using the N-word will probably never see the light of day after a judge blocked the incriminating video's release. In the deposition  tape, the disgraced celebrity chef says 'yes of course' she used the N-word in the past, sparking the firestorm that has destroyed her reputation and cost her millions. According to TMZ, Deen was terrified the ex-employee accusing her of promoting a racist and sexist work environment in a $1.2 million lawsuit would leak the video to the media. As such, she filed court documents last week asking the judge to block the 'colourful' video. Firestorm: The controversial video sparked a firestorm and caused Deen's sponsors to leave her in droves . The small victory comes after Deen . fired her entire legal team in the ongoing fallout from the racial slurs . scandal that have sunk her career. According to court documents, Deen has replaced Savannah-based firm Oliver Maner with Grace Speights, a Washington, D.C.-based partner in Morgan, Lewis & Bockius' Labor and Employment practice. Grace Speights is considered something of a pioneer as the first African-American woman to become a partner at her law firm. She has also been a keynote speaker at the Attorneys of Color Conference. The hiring could be seen by a cynical move by Deen who is keen to point out she is not a racist after her recent troubles. Legal team: Disgraced celebrity chef Paula Deen has fired her entire legal team in the ongoing fallout from the racial slurs scandal that have sunk her career . ‘She and her team decided the previous attorneys were out of their depth,’ a source close to the Deen family told People. Deen has assembled a new legal team of acclaimed 'heavy hitters' that also includes Patricia Glaser, one of the country's top entertainment lawyers, and Savannah-based Harvey Weitz. Glaser earned a reputation as a 'tough, take-no-prisoners litigator' after securing a $32.5 million payout from NBC for Conan O'Brien for the remainder of his 'The Tonight Show' contract in 2010. The new 'All Stars' legal team will be charged with defending Deen . against the lawsuit filed by Lisa Jackson, a former manager of . Uncle Bubba's Seafood and Oyster House, owned by the chef with her . brother Bubba Hiers. Replaced: Deen has replaced Savannah-based firm Oliver Maner with Grace Speights, (left) a Washington, D.C.-based partner in Morgan, Lewis & Bockius' Labor and Employment practice. She also fired her longtime agent Barry Weiner (right) What started out as the defense of a civil lawsuit has turned into an operation to try and salvage what's left of Deen's business empire after she lost a host of major sponsors and her slot on the Food Network . It was in a legal deposition connected with the case that Deen admitted under oath to having used the N-word. Since then she has suffered a dramatic fall from grace and her earnings have crumbled following the departure of major sponsors including Target and Walmart. Securing a victory in the upcoming civil action against Jackson will be imperative to rebuilding Deen's public brand. Since the scandal broke, she has been working with reputation expert Judy Smith, the inspiration behind . the Olivia Pope character in ABC's hit drama Scandal. Last week Deen split with longtime agent Barry Weiner, who had helped make her a star. Deen had worked with Weiner for more than a decade. She . has said he was instrumental in getting her show 'Paula's Home Cooking' on the . Food Network in 2002. Scene: Lisa Jackson worked at the restaurant, pictured, in Savannah, Georgia between 2005 and 2010 . 'Paula Deen has separated from her agent,' Deen's spokeswoman, Elana Weiss, . said in a prepared statement. 'She and her family thank him for the tireless effort . and dedication over the many years.' After the N-word scandal, the Food Network passed on renewing Deen's contract and yanked her shows off . the air. Smithfield Foods, the pork producer that paid Deen as a celebrity . endorser, dropped her soon after. Retailers including Walmart and Target quickly announced that they would no longer sell Deen's products and publisher Ballantine scuttled plans . for an upcoming cookbook even when it was the No. 1 seller on Amazon. Even . the diabetes drug company that made the much-criticized deal to hire Deen as a . paid spokeswoman dumped her. Weiner had worked to turn Deen into a comfort-food queen since she was little . more than a Savannah restaurant owner and self-publisher of cookbooks who earned . raves for her fried chicken. In her book 'Paula Deen: It Ain't All About the Cookin,' Deen recalled . meeting Weiner through TV producer Gordon Elliott, who was convinced they could . turn her into a star. 'Barry and Gordon felt like there was a show somewhere inside this Paula . character that could be very successful,' Deen wrote. 'They probably courted . Food Network for two years trying to push me at them.' Deen also noted in her book: 'Barry is affectionately known in my family as . Barry Cuda. Perfect name for an agent.' The chef's business deals began falling apart after she was questioned under oath . in May as part of a civil lawsuit filed last year by Lisa Jackson, a former . manager of Uncle Bubba's Seafood and Oyster House, which Deen co-owns with her . brother, Bubba Hiers. Jackson says she was sexually harassed and worked in an . environment rife with racial slurs and innuendo. Family: Bubba, left, allegedly made repeated sexual jokes in front of co-workers . Ultimately it was Deen's own words that proved damaging. Asked in her . deposition if she had ever used the N-word, she replied: 'Yes, of course.' That . she also insisted 'it's been a very long time' seemed to matter little to the . companies paying to use her name and image with their products. Neither were . they swayed by Deen's apologies in online videos and in person with the 'Today' show's Matt Lauer. Forbes magazine last year ranked Deen as the fourth-highest-earning celebrity . chef last year, figuring she had hauled in $17 million. Her company Paula Deen . Enterprises generates total annual revenue of nearly $100 million, according to . Burt Flickinger III, president of retail consultancy Strategic Resource . Group. Deen cast no blame in her statement announcing her split with Weiner. It . ended by saying, 'Paula wishes him well in all future endeavors.'","The celebrity chef reportedly filed documents asking the judge in the case to block the release of the incriminating video .

Lawyers for Rod Blagojevich filed an appeal just before a midnight . deadline Monday that challenges the imprisoned former Illinois . governor's corruption conviction and 14-year prison term, including on . grounds the trial judge allegedly committed a litany of errors. The 100-plus page filing with the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals . in Chicago comes more than two years after the Chicago Democrat's . retrial and 16 months after he entered a federal prison in Colorado. Jurors convicted Blagojevich, 56, of engaging in wide-ranging . corruption, including that the two-term governor sought to profit from . his power to appoint someone to the U.S. Senate seat that Barack Obama . vacated to become president. Corrupt: Former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich attempted to sell an appointment to the Senate seat once held by President Barack Obama . Blagojevich's most shocking crime in the eyes of most observers was . no crime at all, the appeal contends. Blagojevich was merely engaging in . standard politics when he floated the idea of securing a U.S. Cabinet . seat or ambassadorship for himself if he appointed Obama confidant . Valerie Jarrett to the Senate seat, it says. Neither Obama nor Jarrett . have ever been accused of any wrongdoing in the case. ""The record shows that Blagojevich's proposed exchange was an arm's . length political deal, described by Blagojevich as a political 'horse . trade,'"" the appeal says. It wasn't criminal ""because the political deal . proposed by Blagojevich was a proper and common exchange under our . democratic system of government."" The appeal also points to what it says was a lack of evenhandedness . by U.S. District Judge James Zagel throughout Blagojeivch's two trials. It alleges Zagel gave Blagojevich little choice but to testify at his . retrial after repeatedly ruling arguments the defense viewed as crucial . could only be broached by Blagojevich himself from the witness stand. Once on the stand, Zagel prohibited many of those statements, including . Blagojevich's attempt to tell jurors he believed at the time that his . actions were legal, it contends. 14 Years: Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, left, walks with attorneys as he arrives at the Federal Correctional Institution Englewood in Colorado in March 2012 to serve a 14-year sentence . ""Had Blagojevich been permitted to present his good-faith defense, it . would have been a powerful defense, likely to produce an acquittal,"" his lawyers argue. The appeal also blames Zagel for allowing a juror who allegedly . expressed bias against Blagojevich to remain on the jury despite defense . attorneys' objections. The appeal only referred to the panelist as . Juror No. 174, saying he said about Blagojevich during jury selection, . ""I just figured him, possibly, to be guilty."" The appeal also raises longstanding claims that Zagel barred FBI . wiretap evidence that might have aided the defense, that he sided . overwhelming with prosecutors and that he miscalculated the appropriate . prison term for Blagojevich. The appeal was filed about 30 minutes before midnight. Blagojevich was convicted on 18 counts over two trials, jurors in the . first deadlocking on all but one count. Taking the stand in the second, . decisive trial in 2011, Blagojevich insisted his talking about wanting . to sell Obama's seat was just that — talk. Zagel imposed a lengthy prison term at a sentencing hearing later in . 2011, telling Blagojevich he had abused voters' trust and undermined the . democratic process ""to do things that were only good for yourself."" Blago: Blagojevich speaks to the media outside his home in Chicago, as his wife Patti wipes away her tears a day before he was to report to prison . Many observers at the time said Blagojevich's best hope on appeal . wasn't that a higher court would overturn his convictions but that . appellate judges would agree his sentence was too harsh. Appeals can take years to play out, and defendants rarely prevail. Another Illinois governor convicted for corruption, George Ryan, . filed multiple appeals over years and lost every key ruling. The former . Republican leader was recently released after more than five years in . prison and seven months of home confinement. Secret wiretaps of an often foul-mouthed Blagojevich eager to earn big money were at the core of prosecutors' case. ""I've got this thing and it's f------ golden,"" jurors heard . Blagojevich saying in one wiretapped conversation about Obama's vacated . seat. ""And I'm just not giving it up for f------ nothing."" As Inmate No. 40892-424 in the Federal Correctional Institution . Englewood in suburban Denver, Blagojevich's life is highly regimented, . including frequent head counts and having to wake at dawn. 'F**king Golden': Blagojevich wanted to appoint Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett to the Senate in exchange for an ambassadorship for himself . In a Facebook posting this year, Blagojevich's wife, Patti, said her . husband is spending time in prison teaching Civil War history and . learning to play the guitar. She added that he frequently jogs around a . quarter-mile prison track. ""All that we have been left with is a aching hole in our lives,"" she added about herself and the couple's two daughters. After the then-governor's Dec. 9, 2008 arrest, Blagojevich hit the . talk show circuit to declare his innocence and to rail against . prosecutors.

No stranger to scandal, Petraeus quickly decided this was one battle not worth fighting. Change of heart: Former general and CIA head David Petraeus announced Monday he would forgo a salary at CUNY . Explaining that Petraeus didn’t take the job for the money, his lawyer Robert Barnett told the New York Times that ‘he decided it was much more important to keep the focus on the students, on the school and on the teaching,’ causing him to propose the change. First reported by Gawker, the astonishingly high salary, worked out to about $2,250 an hour, according to the site. An average full-time faculty member pulls in just under $90,000, and adjuncts in the CUNY system usually make less than $3,000 per course, according to reports. The salary sparked outrage among faculty routinely seen picketing through the streets of the city demanding higher wages and better health insurance, among other things. Though eventually lowered to $150,000, the salary still infuriated the CUNY staff union. ‘It is obscene for a university that operates on a bare-bones budget to pay anyone $150,000 for a single course,’ Professional Staff Congress President Barbara Bowen said in a statement.’ Every dollar raised at CUNY, whether from public or private sources, should go to providing broad access to a quality college education,’ the statement continued. The Brooklyn chapter of the PSC even accused CUNY Chancellor Matthew Goldstein of ‘stealing from PSC members to pay Petraeus’ bloated salary.’ Scandal: The salary offered by CUNY to Pertaeus to each a three hour-per-week seminar at Macaulay Honors College caused widespread furor . In addition to working only three hours per week, Petraeus was given access to graduate student support ‘course research, administration, and grading, as well as limited travel funds,’ according to the offer letter first obtained by Gawker and reviewed by Mail Online. As time passed, vitriol over the shocking pay only grew. Brad Lander, a city Councilman, began a petition demanding CUNY ‘rescind the $150,000 payday for David Petraeus, and put those funds toward supporting low-income students or hiring more teachers.’ The petition has 3,200 signatures to date. More prestigious: Petraeus giving a keynote address at the University of Southern California earlier this year . City Advocate Bill DeBlasio, currently running for mayor, prodded CUNY to reconsider the pay it offered to their big ticket hire. Correspondence between Petraeus and university adminstrators uncovered by Gawker showed that CUNY planned to fund the salary through ‘funds from a private gift.’ That gift appears to have never materialized. To his credit, Petraeus, in emails exchanged with a dean, didn't seem preoccupied with the salary, even bragging he could have made more and chosen a more prestigious institution. CUNY administrators defended the salary, telling the Times that Petraeus is ‘an extremely valuable teacher for our students,’ and called the furor over the pay ‘unfortunate.’ Mail Online was unable to reach CUNY or Petraeus for further comment.","Administrators first tried to calm outrage by lowering offer to $150,000 .

A teenage girl ‘died instantly’ when she was sliced in two by a shark while snorkelling near the beach on a paradise island in the Indian Ocean. The 15-year-old, who lives on the French mainland, was less than 15 feet (five metres) from the shore of the island of Reunion, located off the coast of Madagascar, when the savage attack took place. Her terrified sister was among those who saw the girl schoolgirl disappear under the water at around 3pm today. Paradise island: The girl was attacked as she swam off a beach on the island of Reunion, in the Indian Ocean . The teenager's body was sliced in two at the torso, . and then ‘a part of her body was taken away by the shark,’ said a . said Gina Hoarau, the head of public safety on the island. She added: ‘The girls were in an area of St Paul bay where swimming is not allowed. She would have died instantly. 'The operation to recover the upper part of her body is ongoing.’ Huguette Bello, the mayor of St Paul, said: ‘The girl, who was 15, came from mainland France and spent her holidays on the island. ‘She was staying on the island with her father, who is in charge of the yacht club in St Paul. 'Both of the girls had masks and snorkels on, and were swimming just in front of the Bay restaurant.’ Paradise lost: The Island of Reunion is located in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Madagascar . Mr Bello said it was the first time ‘in a long time’ that a shark had attacked swimmers so close to the beach. There have been recent attacks on surfers, but it is highly unusual for sharks to come so close to the water’s edge. In . May a French honeymooner was attacked and killed by a shark while he . was surfing not far from the beach on Reunion, which is in the Indian . Ocean. The 36-year-old . was in the sea off the popular beach of Brisants de Saint-Gilles when a . shark charged at him twice, prompting a nearby swimmer to raise the . alert when he saw blood on the water. Predator: The shark swam off with part of the girl's body which workers are still trying to retrieve . Lifeguards jumped in the water to fetch the victim, who had lost a lot of blood and was in cardiac and respiratory arrest. They brought him back to the beach but were unable to revive him. The shark had bitten the surfer on the arm and on the thigh. His wife was on the beach when the attack happened, and was treated for shock. The latest deadly shark attack means there have been two on the island this year, while three people have been killed by sharks in the past two years. Sharks are not man-eaters, but sometimes mistake humans for their natural prey, like seals or tortoises, and at other times hurt surfers as they ‘mouth’ them out of curiosity, experts say. Last year, 78 shark attacks were reported around the world, of which eight were fatal.","French teenager 'died instantly' in shark attack on paradise island .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 15:15 EST, 15 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:33 EST, 15 July 2013 . Guilty: Michael Scripps, 36, was charged with stealing $3.6million from his mother and mildly autistic uncle . A media company heir raised in what . he called a wealthy but dysfunctional Philadelphia family has been . sentenced to nine years in prison for stealing millions of dollars from . his mother and disabled uncle. A defense lawyer argued today that Michael Scripps, 36, has built a productive life after becoming estranged from the family in 2006. But a federal judge says the theft caused the estrangement. Scripps was convicted of fraud at an April trial. Prosecutors . say he persuaded his mother to let his college friend in suburban . Philadelphia manage $9 million of her and her brother's money. Scripps . then stole $3.6 million, with about $300,000 going to the friend, . Richard 'Duke' Gleeson. He faces sentencing later today. Michael Scripps is a descendant of James E. Scripps, the founder of The Detroit News. The court in April heard details of how the family squandered away millions by buying dresses owned by Princess Diana, enough marijuana to supply a daily drug habit, and funding the college education of a porn star. Michael Scripps was found guilty for depleting his mother Melissa and autistic uncle David's fortunes with his lavish spending. Before she could point the finger at him, however, she had to admit that she spent millions on her own whims, paying to have her dogs flown to their second home in the Caribbean by private plane and treating relatives to world cruises. She also indulged in treats for herself, including two of Princess Diana's glamorous dresses, a Napoleonic tiara and teddy bears that cost thousands of dollars. Adding to her spending was her daily marijuana habit and the various legal bills that came from her four marriages. Her spending decisions are just the tip of the iceberg, however, as her son Michael allegedly tricked her into handing over control of the $11million she made when the Scripps media conglomerate was sold in the 1980s for more than $700million. James E. Scripps had founded The Detroit News and built the Evening News Association. After the sale, Melissa had control of both her $11million share and her older brother David's lot, which was undisclosed but was said to be more than hers. Melissa was granted control of David's finances because he is mildly autistic. Big spender: Melissa Scripps, Michael's mother, admitted that before he took control of her finances in 2002, she spent more than $1million on international trips, two of Princess Diana's dresses and a Napoleonic tiara . Lavish: Melissa admitted that she flew her dogs to the family's second home in St Maarten (pictured) by private jet, but she eventually gave her son control of her fortune because he embarrassed her with compromising pictures of her with an exotic dancer at an Atlanta strip club where they blew $90,000 in one night . Her son's defense attorney alleged that Melissa and David's combined wealth was significantly closer to $100million than she claims it is. The tensions arose in the family around 2002, when the prosecution alleged that Michael became concerned about his mother's spending habits. 'Michael thought his mom was spending too much money, she was spending his inheritance,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Linwood C. Wright said in court in April. The Philadelphia Inquirer said that throughout the ordeal, he was not left with nothing, as he had always had his own six-figure trust fund and received a $3,900 monthly stipend. At one point in 2002, Michael, Melissa, David and a friend had a champagne-filled night at an Atlanta strip club that ended up costing $90,000. Melissa was later questioned by her financial advisers about the bill, and Michael showed a picture of his mother in a compromising position with one of the exotic dancers at the club. Expensive taste: Michael's first wife Anna, who he met while she was a college student working as a stripper, testified that he lavished her with jewelry throughout their marriage (stock image) The Inquirer said that out of embarrassment about the incident, she agreed to Michael's request that he take over the control of her and David's finances. Michael then placed the reins in the hands of his college buddy, financial advisor Richard ‘Duke’ Gleeson, who was so eager to please Michael that he agreed to all of his demands when it came to spending the money in ways he wanted. Those ways included keeping his romantic interests happy. At first, it was a stripper named Anna who he met in the 1990s when she was stripping while going to college in New Orleans. She went on to marry him, and she told the Pennsylvania court how he gave her piles of jewels. Recipient: In 2003, Michael began dating porn star Jenna Bearden, whose stage name is Kiki Daire . Testimony: In court, Ms Bearden said that Michael paid for her college education, her apartment in Memphis, her breast enhancement surgery, a pair of diamond earrings and a matching bracelet . More than a decade later, he began dating porn star Jenna Bearden, whose stage name is Kiki Daire. During his courtship of Ms Bearden, Michael flew her to Las Vegas and the Kentucky Derby. He gave her diamond earrings and a matching bracelet. He also paid for her college tuition, her breast enhancement surgery and her apartment in Memphis. All told, he had Mr Gleeson make 500 transfers of Melissa and David’s funds into Michael’s accounts. Things came to a head in 2006 when Michael, stressed after his mother found out about the fund transfers, held a gun up to Ms Bearden’s head and told her to call Melissa. The high life: He also paid for trips for Ms Bearden, including Caribbean cruises, a wild time in Las Vegas and a trip to the Kentucky Derby (pictured here in 2012) It is unclear what happened at the end of the incident, but two years later, Melissa and David were forced to pay Merrill Lynch $5.8million in a settlement deal and tell the FBI that Michael had defrauded them. Michael never testified in the trial but his lawyer argued that the only reason they did so was in order to protect their stash of the fortune. ‘They had to make a criminal out of somebody to protect themselves,’ attorney Michael Dezsi said. The judge urged the jurors not to assign guilt based on the lavish lifestyles of those involved, but to focus on the legality of Michael Scripp’s handling of his mother and uncle’s money.","Heirs to the James E.

Wodehouse used for his most famous comic creation Reginald Jeeves, the valet of Bertie Wooster . He was the unflappable valet who artfully rescued his well-meaning yet embarrassment-prone upper class twit of a master from various sticky social situations. Yet the story behind the naming of Jeeves, who featured alongside Bertie Wooster in the beloved comedy books, has its roots in the sporting world. For it was a talented bowler who died fighting for his country in the First World War that was the inspiration for one of British humour's most enduring characters. Tomorrow will be the 100th anniversary of a cricket match between Gloucester and Warwickshire at Cheltenham, where Percy Jeeves was bowling for the visiting opposition. One of the crowd on that summer day in 1913 was the young writer P.G. Wodehouse, who was already thinking of a series of stories about the peerless valet and his hapless employer . Wodehouse was toying with the name Jevons for the exceedingly competent manservant, but the bowler's name stuck in his mind. So too did the much-loved sportsman's immaculate appearance and quiet confidence. And so Jeeves was born, going on to star in 35 short stories and 11 novels - alongside his foppish master Bertie Wooster - that still capture the imagination of readers worldwide. The stories recount the improbable and unfortunate situations in which Bertie and his equally ridiculous friends find themselves and the manner in which his ingenious valet Jeeves is always able to quietly extricate them. Sadly, Percy Jeeves, who had been tipped to play for England before the Great War, was killed fighting on the Somme just ten months after the first Jeeves and Wooster short story appeared in the Saturday Evening Post - never knowing that he was the inspiration for such a famous literary icon. Murray Hedgcock, a Wodehouse scholar, said: 'We was a very tidy, methodical, clean-cut chap and hugely popular.' Writing team: The Authors XI featured P.G. Wodehouse (back row, third from left) and Arthur Conan Doyle (sixth from left) Comic genius: P.G. Wodehouse and his wife Ethel Wayman in this picture from the 1940s . Norman Murphy, the author of A Wodehouse . Handbook, told The Times: 'Jeeves had much more of a ring about it. Wodehouse was schooled in Greek and Latin and the feeling he learnt for . what sounds good when spoken never left him'. A new book about the cricketer, The Real . Jeeves, has been written by Brian Halford, who will join 100 members of . the Wodehouse Society to celebrate the centenary of the landmark match . tomorrow at Cheltenham. Wodehouse, who died in 1975 aged 93, often took real-life inspiration for his characters and stories from the world around him. A friend of Wodehouse once said that the writer's servant Eugene Robinson possessed all Jeeves's attributes of quick wits and intellect, and may have been the template for Jeeves. Enduring: The exploits of Jeeves And Wooster were adapted into a hit TV show featuring Hugh Laurie as Bertie Wooster and Stephen Fry as Jeeves . Jeeves, his demeanour calm and composed as his gaffe-prone employer Bertie Wooster gets embroiled in yet another scrape . He certainly wasn't alone in basing . names on cricketers. His friend Arthur Conan Doyle, who he also played . cricket with, named his famous detective Sherlock Holmes for two . cricketers named Mordecai Sherwin and Frank Shacklock. The two writers played in the Edwardian cricket team, the Authors. There were a number of literary cricket teams around at the beginning of the twentieth century but the Authors was the only one made up entirely of writers. They would play at Lord’s each year, against sides of Publishers and Actors, with Conan Doyle and Wodehouse sometimes opening the batting together. A.A. Milne, best known for his books about the teddy bear Winnie-the-Pooh, was reportedly the best fielder in the side . In April 2012, the team was revived by a new generation of writers. The ranks include Birdsong Author Sebastian Faulks, history writer Tom Holland, author of Rubicon, and Downton Abbey star Dan Stevens. The stories of P.G. Wodehouse have been loved by generations and he is seen as one of the great humourists of the 20th century. He wrote more than 90 novels and 300 short stories during a literary career spanning more than 70 years. Jeeves and Wooster appeared in 35 short stories and 11 novels together. All but two were written from the perspective of Bertie Wooster, and one of these, Bertie Changes His Mind, was from the perspective of Jeeves. Jeeves continued to appear in Wodehouse's work until his last completed novel Aunts Aren't Gentlemen in 1974, 59 years after the character first appeared. In the early 1990s the stories were televised and became a hit ITV series starring Stephen Fry as Jeeves, and Hugh Laurie as Bertie. The stories remain so popular that Sebastian Faulks, the critically-acclaimed author of Birdsong, will write a new Jeeves and Wooster novel after being approached by the estate of PG Wodehouse. The writer has had a lengthy love of the duo after first reading a story at the age of 12. Jeeves And The Wedding Bells will be published in November.","Percy Jeeves was a bowler for Warwickshire at a match in 1913 .

Only a handful of police officers caught speeding or jumping red lights are prosecuted, it has been revealed. Despite tens of thousands of officers being found breaking the rules of the road, only 753 were punished in the last two years. Figures released under the Freedom of Information Act showed that 75,434 were caught speeding, meaning that less than one per cent were punished. It has led to accusations that police officers are routinely let off without proper checks while ordinary drivers automatically face three penalty points and a £60 fine. Speeding fines: This table shows how many police officers were caught speeding or going through red lights between 2011 and 2013 and how many were prosecuted . Road safety charities said . the high number of fines cancelled was 'worrying' - and it is feared . that senior officers are not carrying out proper checks before letting . police off. Julie Townsend, deputy chief . executive of Brake, said: ‘These figures paint a worrying picture. We . recognise that in emergency situations, especially where lives are at . stake, police need to be able to respond rapidly, but this must be . weighed up against the danger posed to the public - especially people on . foot and bicycle - from speeding. 'We believe police and other . emergency services should be doing everything possible to ensure their . drivers are not putting people at risk of injury or death, and to help . put a stop to the scores of serious casualties that involve emergency . service vehicles each year. 'That . includes having robust procedures to minimise the risks, especially . around decisions around how fast drivers may go in different . circumstances and environments. 'It . also means ensuring that drivers are prosecuted if they have broken . laws unnecessarily and endangered the public, and making sure that . forces are held to account in upholding strict safety standards.' In Leicestershire, police were clocked speeding 5,738 times over the two-and-a-half year period - but just three were prosecuted. This works out as one in every 1,912. Overall, police have been caught by . roadside cameras nationwide 75,434 times in the last two-and-a-half . years, but just 753 were prosecuted. Police forces are able to cancel tickets . given to officers as long as speeding is necessary because they are . responding to a 999 call or pursuing a suspect. The figures were released to the MailOnline under the Freedom of Information Act. The total number of officers caught speeding is likely to be far higher as just 19 out of 45 police forces provided a full response to the request. Breaking the law: The investigation found that 75,434 police vehicles have been caught speeding since 2011 - but there have been just 753 prosecutions . RAC . technical director David Bizley said: 'People understand that police . officers responding to emergency call-outs should in general not be . prosecuted, but offences committed in non-emergency circumstances should . be treated as they are for any other motorist. 'People . are bound to think the number of police officers prosecuted is low . compared to the overall figure of those caught, so it is important that . the police reassure motorists that they treat their own in the same way . as everyone else caught breaking the laws of the road.' John . Giblin, Police Federation of England and Wales roads policing lead, . said that police need to speed when responding to 999 calls - so it is . right that they don't face prosecution. 'It . is no surprise that far more emergency services will be captured on . enforcement devices for exceeding the limit when responding to an . emergency or call by the public for urgent assistance,' he said. 'Police officers are highly skilled . and professionally trained to a very high driving standard and the law . allows them to break the rules only when there is necessity to do so in . order to carry out their duties. 'In . doing so, an officer is expected to provide justification with . necessity for any violations and are accountable for their actions.' A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said that officers had to justify their speeding before tickets are cancelled. 'All . officers are required to adhere to the policy for driving standards. If . a notice of intended prosecution (NIP) is issued to the driver of a . police vehicle the officer is required to justify the use of the police . exemptions used,' he said. 'A supervisor of at least Superintendent rank will quality assure the matter and either support the officer or not. 'If the matter is not supported the driver is required to deal with the NIP as a member of the public would.'","Officers clocked speeding or going through red lights 27,875 times in London - but just 34 were prosecuted .

The NHS is paying up to nearly thirty times the usual cost for common over-the-counter products being prescribed by NHS doctors. Cod-liver oil capsules are being bought for up to £89.50 - with identical versions available to consumers on the high street for just £3.50. GPs and NHS doctors are prescribing the fish oil on prescription, despite it being available without prescription. Pricing scandal: Cod-liver oil capsules are being bought for up to £89.50 - with identical versions available to consumers on the high street for just £3.50 . This means chemists are able to select products they deem suitable from drug companies and . bill the taxpayer, part of the wider prescription scandal which has emerged in recent years. A whistleblower told The Daily Telegraph: 'When they got a prescription for something like cod-liver oil, pharmacists used to walk round the counter, pick a pack off the shelf and then charge the NHS that cost. Now, all of a sudden, they are dispensing packets of cod-liver oil for £89. They don’t even keep these products in the open sale area of the pharmacy.' The newspaper reported that the capsules were supplied by a small pharmaceutical company called Ennogen, in Kent. It sells cod-liver oil under the brand name Elive. Elive extra strength capsules of cod liver oil – 1.05g capsules - cost the NHS £89.50. The comparable product from Seven Seas costs £3.50 – almost thirty times less.

Elive is now very popular among chemists -  last August, Ennogen supplied 0.2 per cent of . the cod liver oil products dispensed by chemists - by March that had risen t0 10.7 per cent. The firm was reimbursed £17,252 by the NHS for extra strength cod liver oil in March. The revelation is likely to add more pressure to the system - the NHS is under pressure to make . savings of £20 billion over the next three years and many trusts have . resorted to cutting staff and rationing treatments. Although the . money it receives from the Government has not been cut - unlike other . departments - it has ordered to spend the money more efficiently. Ministers say the savings have to be made now to ensure there are enough funds to pay for the care of the aging population. In November it was revealed that hospitals are squandering £500million a year paying too much for blankets, syringes and other basic equipment. An investigation found that some are being charged twice as much as others for the same items. Researchers looked at ten NHS trusts and found some hospitals were paying £120 for a box of electric blankets while other paid only £47. Others were charged £23 for a box of forceps which cost others just £13. Some trusts were paying £1,109 for knee implants while others were paying £787. The study by Ernst and Young calculated the annual total wasted as £500million. Ernst and Young’s Joe Stringer said some hospitals were reluctant to tell others their fees as they were competing for patients. He added: 'Our analysis raises serious concerns about price variation and spending in the procurement of NHS supplies. 'At the root of this problem lies the lack of transparency in the market, leaving trusts unable to make cost-efficient decisions about purchasing supplies. 'The consequences of inaction in the back office will only be felt more acutely in frontline care.' Julian Trent, managing director of the price comparison website Peto, who was also involved in the report, warned that suppliers were 'taking advantage' of the NHS. 'It's not necessarily about the competence of the NHS, it's about the pricing behaviour of the suppliers. 'They are taking advantage of a lack of information. What seems to be happening is rather than a fair price being charged, as much as you can get it being charged.' The report did not name individual hospitals or the suppliers. Health minister Lord Howe said that in future hospitals would be better able to compare the prices for equipment. 'We are working on introducing a new barcoding system that will increase transparency, save money and make care safer.' He said. 'The new system will take time, but ultimately it will result in the kind of price comparison website that already exists in other sectors, like supermarkets, and will revolutionise the tracking, safety and use of clinical products bought by the NHS.'","Identical versions available to consumers on the high street for just £3.50 .

Countryside campaigners will target MPs at the next election, demanding that they back reforms to planning laws. They say measures brought in by the Government will allow the greenbelt to be destroyed and threaten thousands of acres of rural land. The Campaign to Protect Rural England will ask every Conservative, Labour or Liberal Democrat candidate to sign a charter to save the English countryside. Sir Andrew Motion, the former Poet Laureat, is president of CPRE, and has named the planning minister 'Boles the Builder' Sir Andrew Motion, president of the CPRE, yesterday came close to saying his group’s 70,000 supporters should vote Labour  – which has vowed to tear up the Coalition’s planning policy rules, unless Tories and Lib Dems change their minds. Sir Andrew, the former Poet Laureate, said he would demand that all three parties’ manifestos included changes to planning policy. He said that otherwise ‘that will be England gone’. The charity yesterday issued a charter, ‘Save Our Countryside’, calling for brownfield land to be built on before greenfield, more say for communities in planning decisions and a focus on better-designed, ‘sensitively located’ affordable homes. CPRE chief executive Shaun Spiers said David Cameron is ‘in denial’ about the effect of his Government’s planning changes on the countryside. He said the CPRE would join the National Trust and other campaigners to press for reform, adding: ‘We will be seeking as many meetings with prospective Parliamentary candidates as possible, asking them to commit to the principles in the charter.’ The dramatic intervention will make the countryside a central feature of the general election in 2015, just as candidates were pressured to oppose university tuition fee rises in 2010. As a charity, the CPRE cannot endorse political candidates, but its army of supporters could well hit the streets for those who share their views. Sir Andrew said: ‘We want to use our charter to influence the general election manifestos of all parties.’ The National Planning Policy Framework, introduced this year, says councils must promote ‘sustainable development’ in planning decisions. Critics say it weakens protections against building on greenfield land. Asked if the CPRE would tell members to vote Labour because of its pledge to reform the NPPF, Sir Andrew said: ‘Vote for the right policies is the right answer. ' CPRE chief executive Shaun Spiers said David Cameron is 'in denial' about the effect of his Government's planning changes on the countryside . It certainly does need reforming and . if the Labour party is the only party which does do the reforming, . people can make their own deductions from that.’ He added: ‘The countryside is not something we can afford to take or leave. It is irreplaceable. ‘We made it together over many centuries, it is our great communal . masterpiece, the greatest thing we have ever made as a nation . . . Once . we have ruined it we can’t “un-ruin” it.’ Calling the situation an ‘emergency’, Sir Andrew added: ‘That will be England gone. That is why we need this charter. ‘We want [ministers] to see that the NPPF is not working despite what seem to be its original good intentions.’ Mr Spiers is seeking talks with David Cameron, who holds the rural Oxfordshire seat of Witney. He said: ‘A lot of development is . planned for the future on greenfield sites. We think the Government is . in denial about the consequences of its policies. ‘I think in particular the Prime Minister is in denial about what is happening on the ground – and about rising anger. ‘We’re working on all three party manifestos. 'The CPRE is a charity and we’re . careful to avoid any hint of being party political but I hope the Prime .

Nearly 2,500 bankers in Britain earn more than a million euros a year despite the financial crisis, figures showed yesterday. A report by the European Banking Authority, an industry regulator, revealed that 2,436 UK bankers were paid at least €1million, or £865,000, in 2011. There were three times more millionaire bankers in Britain than in the rest of the EU combined. Just 739 on the continent were classified as ‘high earners’. Germany was ranked second in the bankers’ pay league with 170 earning over a million euros. France was third with 162. UK bankers pointed out that the figures reflected London’s status as a leading global financial centre. The capital dwarfs rival centres such as Frankfurt and Paris in both the number of workers employed and the amount of business done. But critics said it showed the culture of ‘risk and excess’ was still alive and well in the City. The industry has been rocked by scandals since the financial crisis plunged Britain into its longest downturn for a century. Lenders also stand accused of starving businesses of the cash they need to grow, create jobs and power an economic recovery. The EBA said the 2,436 UK bankers were paid a total of £679million in basic salaries and £2.35billion in bonuses. It meant they earned an average of £1.24million each – down from £2million in 2010 but still 47 times more than the average salary for a full-time worker in the UK, which is £26,500. The High Pay Centre, a group that campaigns against excessive wages, said the fall from 2010 to 2011 was ‘encouraging’. But Luke Hildyard, head of research at the centre, added: ‘We don’t know what has happened in 2012 and the first half of 2013 as the stock market rallied. You wonder whether that trend has continued. There were three times more millionaire bankers in Britain than in the rest of the EU combined. Just 739 on the continent were classified as 'high earners' ‘And we shouldn’t break out the violins for the bankers. We are still looking at a hell of a lot of money. ‘The bonus culture created a culture of invincibility where bankers thought they were above the law. They put ethics aside in pursuit of bonuses. ‘It also increased inequality and created a culture of risk and excess in the City. These bonuses have not come down enough.’ The report underlined the dominance of London and the UK when it comes to high pay in banking. It showed that in eight of the 28 countries reported on, no bankers at all received more than a million euros. ring to push through new rules from Brussels to cap bonuses after next year.","2,436 UK bankers were paid at least £865,000 in 2011 ."

"By . James Chapman . PUBLISHED: . 18:41 EST, 15 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:50 EST, 16 July 2013 . A Tory revival has seen them move level with Labour for the first time in almost 18 months, while support for UKIP has slipped back. A poll puts the two main parties neck and neck on 36 per cent, meaning the Conservatives are back on the share of the vote they achieved at the 2010 general election. The findings will cause alarm at Labour HQ, given that there are only tentative signs of the economy recovering and most pollsters predict the Tories will reap further benefits if there is a prolonged return to growth. Neck and neck: David Cameron and Ed Miliband's parties are now both on 36 per cent in the polls . Labour have been ahead in the polls since March 2012, when George Osborne delivered a much-criticised Budget. But in recent months the Tory mood has been buoyed by policy announcements on an EU referendum, welfare reform and immigration. Home Secretary Theresa May also saw hate preacher Abu Qatada, whose case thwarted successive Labour ministers, deported to Jordan. The crucial factor in the Conservative surge, however, appears to be indications that the economy is finally turning. Official statistics also showed Britain did not in fact suffer a double dip recession under the Tories, meaning the only slump was on Labour’s watch. Stewart Jackson, MP for Peterborough and a Tory right-winger who has often been critical of his party’s leadership, suggested last night’s poll would bring Labour leader Ed Miliband out in a ‘cold sweat’. The ICM survey for the Guardian appears . at odds with others, with one YouGov poll at the weekend giving Labour . an 11 point lead. However the Independent’s poll of polls recently found . a fall in the size of Labour’s lead from 13 points to six in the past . four months. ICM’s poll last month showed a strong Labour lead of seven points. But last night’s survey showed an extraordinary turnaround, with the Conservatives on 36 per cent (up seven on last month), Labour 36 per cent (no change), Liberal Democrats 13 per cent (up one) and UKIP 7 per cent (down 5). The Tories appear to be benefiting from a steady erosion in support for the anti-EU upstart UKIP, which fell from 18 per cent in May just after its success in local elections to 12 per cent in June and is now in single figures. Tory strategists have long argued that support for UKIP is in part a protest vote exercised in relatively unimportant elections, such as those for councils and the European Parliament, which will not be replicated in a general election when voters are confronted with the choice between either a Tory-led or Labour-led government. However, Nigel Farage’s party will hope for a resurgence of interest during the European Parliament elections next June, when it is aiming to come first in terms of national share of the vote. Looking upwards: Nigel Farage's UKIP is down five per cent on last months polls, but the leader has high hopes for next years European Parliament elections . The Conservatives believe they have . countered some of UKIP’s appeal by backing legislation paving the way . for a referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU to take place by the . end of 2017. Both Labour and the Lib Dems have refused to back a . referendum. A Labour source said the ICM poll ‘feels outside the margin’, adding: ‘Polls come and go but it’s fair to point out in the last few days we have seen leads of 11, seven, 11, eight and eight points.’ Tory backbenchers demanding that David Cameron follows more hardline policies are engaged in ‘fantasy politics’, former donor Lord Ashcroft has claimed. A poll commissioned by the Tory peer has found that policies proposed in an Alternative Queen’s Speech are not universally popular. Tory right-wingers have proposed 42 private members’ bills proposing everything from the banning of the burqa to the return of the death penalty. But the poll found that just 13 per cent of voters agree that the August Bank Holiday should be renamed Margaret Thatcher Day, another key proposal. Only one in four voters support allowing employees to opt out of the minimum wage, scrapping the Department of Energy & Climate Change and privatising the BBC. Lord Ashcroft said that to win in 2015 ‘we certainly need to deliver on immigration, crime and welfare reform, but it is at least as important for the Tories to be a competent and united party of government that can be trusted on the economy and public services’.","Both main political parties on 36 per cent in latest poll .

Vermin: A pigeon of the kind fed by a Bolton woman, earning her a £75 fine from one of the council's plain-clothes 'education and enforcement' officers . Woman eats pasty. Woman unwraps pasty. Woman feeds tiny scrap of leftover pasty to a nearby pigeon. Woman puts packet in the bin. So far, so ordinary. Well, at least it was – right up until the woman was issued with a £75 fine for littering. She had the misfortune to catch the eye of a plain-clothes ‘education and enforcement’ worker from the local council, who promptly gave her a fixed penalty notice because she fed the bird. The lunchtime encounter happened in Bolton city centre and was witnessed by Gavin Moynihan, an AA worker. He said: ‘I was really annoyed by what happened. I could not believe it. She was putting rubbish in the bin and then just gave a bit of her pasty to the birds. ‘A man came over and told her what she was doing was against some Act and gave her a fine. I was really shocked.’ Bolton council said even though the woman had binned the wrapper correctly, her actions constituted littering because pigeons are ‘vermin’ and should not be fed. But it has since decided that the woman’s pasty will not turn into a very expensive lunchtime treat after all. The council received a complaint over the incident and has backed down over the fine. ‘It is not our intention to target individuals unnecessarily and issue fines where education is more appropriate,’ a spokesman said. ‘Feeding pigeons in the town centre is discouraged as the birds are vermin and seen as a nuisance to many.’ He added: ‘We will be writing to the individual with the intention of cancelling the fixed penalty notice, but would like to remind the public dropping litter is an offence and we would advise people not to encourage pigeons by feeding them.’ The council said the fine was issued by a member of its plain-clothed education and enforcement team, whose other roles include tackling fly-tipping. It stressed that feeding pigeons would still be deemed a littering offence in future. Local shop worker Mark Schofield, 51, supported the council’s position. He said: ‘If people are fined for dropping a cigarette end they should be fined for dropping any sort of litter.’ It’s not the first time a few crumbs have proved potentially costly. In 2008, Sarah Davies was issued with a £75 fine for dropping a piece of sausage roll while feeding it to her four-year-old daughter Chloe, but a judge in Hull threw the case out. The following year, Vanessa Kelly, 26, was fined £75 for allowing her 17-month-old son Harry to feed bread to ducks in Smethwick, West Midlands.","Bolton council said the woman's actions constituted littering because pigeons are 'vermin' and should not be fed .

Hundreds of meatballs laced with rat poison have been scattered around San Francisco in an apparent attempt to sicken or even kill local dogs. At least two animals have already been struck down after eating the tainted meat, including a seven-year-old dachshund called Oskar who remains in critical but stable condition. Police are warning residents about the nasty prank they called a 'truly unusual' crime after the meatballs were discovered in the Twin Peaks, Diamond Heights, Lower Haight, Cole Valley, Hayes Valley and Bernal Heights neighborhoods. Scroll down for video . Poison: Hundreds of meatballs laced with rat poison, like those pictured, have been scattered around San Francisco in an apparent attempt to sicken or even kill local dogs . Concerned community members have collected and disposed of hundreds of the balls, placed deliberately in areas where dogs frequent. Police still do not know who made the meatballs, believed to contain the poisonous substance strychnine, or left them in the street, but the investigation is ongoing. They told residents at a community meeting last week that so far no reported pet deaths have been linked to the meatballs. Victim: At least two animals have already been struck down after eating the tainted meat, including a seven-year-old dachshund called Oskar, pictured, who remains in critical but stable condition . Mean: Police still do not know who made the meatballs, believed to contain the poisonous substance strychnine, or left them in the street, but the investigation is ongoing . 'We've heard (through social media) that there have been some pets that have supposedly died, but we can't confirm any deaths,' Park Police station Inspector Joseph Nannery said. Nannery said someone may have planted the malicious meatballs because they dislike barking dogs, they feel threatened, or are tired of the pets pooping in the area. Oskar ingested one of the meatballs near Crestline Drive and Burnett Avenue in Twin Peaks. Scattered: The meatballs were discovered in the Diamond Heights neighborhood, pictured, as well as Lower Haight, Cole Valley, Hayes Valley and Bernal Heights . He is being treated at Animal Internal Medicine and Specialty Services after he began having seizures immediately after eating the meat. He has been placed on a ventilator. 'We're still optimistic,' Dr. Carrie Jurney told the San Francisco Examiner about Oskar's recovery. 'We just have to get over a few more humps, but he's a fighter.'

Payout: Alan Whittle, 57, who earned £150,000 a year, received £72,000 compensation after resigning from his job . The former chief executive of a scandal-hit hospital who defied repeated calls to quit received a £72,000 pay-off as 'compensation' when he finally resigned. Alan Whittle, 57, who has a £1.7million pension pot, also received £30,000 in cash tax-free in the months before he quit - on top of his £150,000-a-year salary. He ran Basildon Hospital which was slammed by regulators in 2009 for bad nursing standards, dirty wards and a lack of leadership which led to an estimated 400 avoidable deaths a year. Mr Whittle was engulfed in scandal himself when he walked out on his wife of 28 years Tracy and moved into hospital accommodation with his mistress. He presented the mother of his four sons with an 'exotic' bouquet of flowers on their wedding anniversary in September 2007 before walking out on her minutes later so that he could be with Karen Bates, who was a patient safety manager at his hospital. Mr Whittle, who is a former local government accountant, finally quit his post last September and received his £72,000 payoff as 'compensation for loss of office'. Last night hospital bosses claimed they did not know why he received the severance pay and said it was approved by former hospital chairman Sir Peter Dickson. Payouts are usually made to people made redundant or who are asked to resign. However, the hospital maintained Mr Whittle, who was a local authority accountant before working his way up at the hospital, stood down voluntarily. A spokeswoman said: 'This was a decision of the previous chairman so you would need to ask him why it was approved. We have a new board that was not party to this decision, but we understand Mr Whittle resigned.' Details of the payout were included in the hospital's annual report. Mr Whittle, who earned more than Prime . Minister David Cameron, announced he was leaving in January 2012, but . did not go until current boss Clare Panniker took over in September. Her arrival signalled several changes on the board of directors. Scandal hit: Basildon University Hospital was slammed by regulators in 2009 for bad nursing standards, dirty wards and a lack of leadership which led to an estimated 400 avoidable deaths a year . Dozens of patients died needlessly at Basildon Hospital because of appalling standards, a damning report said. Unannounced visits by inspectors from the Care Quality Commission found blood spattered on curtains and chairs in the A&E ward, a catheter bag on the floor, poorly-trained nurses and patients treated on trolleys. A commode was soiled under the seat, nurses were failing to feed frail elderly people and patients had pressure sores. The report slammed bad management at the 'elite' hospital which was designated as a foundation trust. Local MP Jackie Doyle-Price, who has spoken out about the 'utterly complacent' attitude of management at the hospital, said it was a golden handshake for failure. 'Unfortunately we see this all too often in the NHS, when people fail they get a golden handshake,' she said. 'We need to shine a light on some of those payouts. In my view Mr Whittle should have fallen on his sword a lot earlier. 'The board should have held him to account. By 2005 it was clear Basildon Hospital was failing and in 2009 it was criticised by regulators. 'We pay board of directors to act on our behalf and challenge management. They were turning up and taking the money but not asking questions. 'I am pleased that now we have got rid of all that and there is a chance for this hospital to rise again.' Mr Whittle did not respond to requests for a comment at his home in Chafford Hundred, Essex.","Alan Whittle, 57, was boss of Basildon Hospital which was slammed by regulators for bad nursing standards and dirty wards .

A violent prisoner has escaped for a second time in nine months after he was sentenced for absconding while serving time for robbery and actual bodily harm. Mark Donnison, 43, fled from Hollesley Bay yesterday morning despite a judge telling him he would not be released in the 'immediate future' when he was recaptured after absconding. He had been transferred in May to the open facility in Suffolk nicknamed Holiday Bay because of its 'relaxed' regime. Absconded: Violent Mark Donnison, 43, is on the run for the second time in less than a year after he escaped from an open prison in Suffolk . Donnison was arrested when he was recognised by police officers at a chip shop in Hull four weeks after going missing from North Sea Camp open prison, Lincolnshire, in August last year. He was put back behind bars by a judge at Hull Crown Court where he was told he would not be able to secure an early release when he was jailed for another four months. Judge Mark Bury warned him: 'You could have received a much longer sentence but the reality is, here is a serving prisoner serving a life sentence and the real punishment will come because you will not be able to secure any form of early release in the immediate future.' Donnison was warned that he could . spend life behind bars when he was jailed in 2007 as he would only be . released if it was considered he was no longer a danger to society. His . indeterminate sentence for carrying out a robbery in Hull stated that . he could only apply for parole after serving a minimum of three and a . half years. Donnison went on the run with another prisoner, Gary Lawson, 31, when he absconded from North Sea Camp on August 10 last year. Lawson was serving a life sentence for the murder of pensioner Alfred Wilkins, whose home in Grimsby was set on fire in 2001. Both . Lawson and Donnison were jailed in October at Hull Crown Court for four . months to run concurrently with their existing sentences. His second bid for freedom has sparked outrage with Humberside Police Commissioner Matthew Grove who said resources were being directed towards recapturing him. Missing: Staff at Hollesley Bay realised Donnison had absconded at around 8am on Monday morning . He said: 'I am concerned that a man who is serving a life sentence . for robbery and who escaped from an open prison in August last year has . been put back in another prison from which he has been able to escape . again. 'This news will rightly . raise questions in the minds of residents in Hull and Suffolk as to . what processes are followed by the prison service to ensure the risk of . prisoners escaping is mitigated. Anger: Suffolk Coastal MP Therese Coffey has vowed to raise the issue with the Ministry of Justice . 'I . am sure residents will also be asking themselves why local police . resources will once again be spent on recapturing someone who chooses to . put two fingers up at the justice system. 'These . are questions I will be raising on their behalf with the Justice . Secretary, whom I intend to write to concerning this case.' Suffolk Coastal Tory MP Therese Coffey pledged to take up the case with the Ministry of Justice. 'It . is concerning that an offender with a history of absconding . is put in an open prison,' she added, before criticising the decision to . impose a concurrent jail sentence as punishment for Donnison's initial . escape. 'In my opinion, the sentence should have been . added to run consecutively and not concurrently,' she said. Peter Cuthbertson, from the Centre for Crime Prevention, which calls for tougher sentencing, said: 'The use of open prisons should be scaled back dramatically to prevent cases like this. 'They make a mockery of punishment, and in far too many cases lead to dangerous criminals avoiding justice. This puts the public at risk and wastes police time,' he added. A . spokesman for the Prison Service said: 'The number of absconds from . open prisons in 2011-12 was the lowest level since central records . began, and only those risk assessed as suitable for open conditions are . placed in open prisons. 'Those who do abscond will be returned to a more secure prison and may face further charges.' A spokesman for Suffolk Police said: 'Police are asking anyone who may have seen him or anyone with information about where he is now to contact officers. 'You should not approach him or take any further action. He has connections to the Bridlington and Hull areas.' Donnison is of medium build, around 5ft10ins tall, with tattoos of an eagle on his lower right arm and the name ‘Mark’ across his knuckles.","Mark Donnison, 43, vanished from Hollesley Bay open prison in Suffolk .

She was thrust into the spotlight by Big Brother, became a celebrity overnight and appeared to be constantly in the media headlights until her tragic death from cervical cancer at age 27. Now Jade Goody's life - one that everybody seemed to have an opinion on - will be played out in an opera. The contemporary style performance, written by Afsaneh Gray, takes a close look at Jade Goody's life as a study of modern day 'celebrity'. Tragic: The public celebrity life of Jade Goody, pictured signing copies of her autobiography 'Catch A Falling Star', is the focus of a new opera playing in August . Jade, pictured left in May 2006 posing for the launch of her TV show Just Jade, and right, once she had been diagnosed with cervical cancer, had a life that was played out 'in a theatrical way' in the media, said opera director Pia Furtado . Speaking to the Mail Online, Ms Gray said she was inspired to write an opera on Jade while working in an office as medical secretary. She said women in the office were constantly pouring over Jade Goody's life as it was splashed across gossip magazines, and everybody always had an opinion on it. Some ranged from support for the Big Brother star, others were less compassionate and far more critical accusing her of being 'racist' from her various public outbursts. Realising the strength of feeling . people had on such public figures, Ms Gray decided to write an opera on . 'celebrity' and focus on the tragic life of Jade. 'I like to do things that have some kind of contemporary resonance,' she said. Jade's relationship with Jack Tweed was also a public affair. Following numerous allegations of Tweed being unfaithful the pair broke up, but they later rekindled their relationship . Jade, pictured on her wedding day as she married Jack Tweed on February 22, 2009, died after losing her fight with cervical cancer less than one month later, on March 12 . 'It's important it's not just about Jade Goody, it's about celebrity.' Ms Gray worked with composer Erick Flores over three-and-a-half years to produce the final production. They named the opera, 'and the Crowd (wept)' and were keen to highlight that Jade's name did not appear in the title. Together, they decided that Jade would be played by three people, all on stage at the same time, showing the different sides of the star, performed in the first person as well as the various ways she was perceived in the media. The three Jades, who sing a 'Jade chorus', are played by Cathy Bell, Sarah Minns and Norah King. Throughout the opera it is also narrated in a 'fairy-tale like way', by David Hansford. Jade's tragic story captured the hearts of people across the country and her funeral saw well-wishers throw flowers at her hearse during the procession through Loughton Essex . Fans posted up tributes, right, outside St John the Baptist Church in Buckhirst Hill, Essex, during her funeral after her decorated hearse, left, had driven past . Director Pia Furtado, who has worked on pieces performed by Opera North and the Royal Opera, told the Mail Online she was drawn to the production because of the contemporary and challenging style of the show. She said: 'I think new opera is always . interesting because you're trying to find new voices and (doing) work . that's responding to something very current.' Ms . Furtado says compared with traditional opera, you are working with . contemporary stories and issues, as opposed to trying to layer . contemporary ideas over traditional operas. She said of Jade: 'What a fascinating character whose life was played out in such an already-theatrical way.' Jade shot into the limelight in 2002 when she appeared on the third series of Big Brother. Her new fame led to her own TV programmes and the launch of her own products. While the outspoken Big Brother . housemate found herself a new career through the show, it also saw her . voted as one of the 100 Worst  Britons, in a Channel 4 production. As the poster highlights, left, the opera tells the story of Jade Goody's life from three perspectives, from the first person and from various media archives. Writer Afsaneh Gray, right, says she got the idea for the opera while working . in an office and listening to everyone's different opinions about the Big . Brother star . Things went downhill for Jade when she was accused of being 'racist' on a subsequent Celebrity Big Brother show. She made public apologies to Indian actress Shilpa Shetty once she was booted out of the house, and the next year appeared in a version of India's Big Brother. But the star withdrew early from the August 2008 show after being told she had cervical cancer - a disease that would eventually kill her less than a year later. While her roller coaster life was played out in such a public way in the media, people across the country reacted to it in different ways. Ms . Furtado said of the opera: 'What's interesting about this particular piece was not about her life but how it was consumed and how people reacted to it.' The narration describes how young Jade always had fairytale dreams of stardom, but the tragedy is that her heavenly desires did not turn out how she had dreamt. 'and the Crowd (wept)' will be performed over two nights, on August 1 and 2, at the Tete a Tete opera festival, at London's Riverside Studios in west London.","Story of modern-day celebrity, told through the study of Jade Goody's life .

Broadcasting regulator Ofcom is investigating the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 over their decision to give airtime to Anjem Choudary after soldier Lee Rigby’s murder. Shocked viewers complained when the radical cleric refused to condemn the killing in Woolwich in interviews with Channel 4 News, BBC2’s Newsnight and ITV’s Daybreak following Fusilier  Rigby’s death on May 22. Choudary admitted he knew one of the suspects, Michael Adebolajo, after meeting him at Islamist demonstrations.

She added she was ‘really angry’ that broadcasters were ‘giving a platform to one appalling man who represents nobody’. After receiving 22 complaints from viewers, Ofcom has launched an official probe. The watchdog said there were grounds to look at whether the programmes met ‘acceptable standards’.

It was 1968 and as a penniless, 21-year-old student he couldn't scrape the funds together to buy the Vincent HRD classic. Instead he advised his friend John Lumley to snap it up, insisting it was a fantastic find that would one day pay off. Good turn: Brian Hill was a struggling student when he advised his friend John Lumley to snap up the Vincent HRD in 1968 . Back in the driving seat: More than 40 years after Brian first set eyes on the Vincent, he is now finally able to ride it . Heartbreak: Brian, pictured as a student in 1968, didn't have the money to buy the Vincent at the time . For more than 40 years the pair still kept in touch from time to time and Mr Hill, from Longfield, Kent, always joked that he was now able to pay John £40 for the bike. In 2009, he received a sad phone call to say John had passed away from pancreatic cancer - but in an unexpected final gesture of kindness, he had left Mr Hill the 1937 Vincent Rapide in his will. Generous: Brian advised his friend John Lumley, pictured, to snap up the rare Vincent . The value of classic motorbikes has rocketed in the intervening years, and the rare motorcycle would now be expected to fetch around £225,000 if put up for auction. When Mr Hill received the British-built Vincent, the 15th of just 78 ever made, it was still in bits in the original tea chests it was first sold in. But he was determined to ride the bike just as he had always wanted, and spent eight months and around £10,000 restoring it. Mr Hill, now 66, said: 'My father used to have a Vincent motorbike when I was a child and they really got into my blood. 'He sold it in 1960 when I was only 13 and so I never had the chance to enjoy it. When I got my bike licence I decided I wanted a Vincent. One day I was at a bike meeting when I saw an amazing model, the Rapide, that was made in the 1930s. 'I fell in love with it straight away. Two or three years later I had a call from a friend who told me there was a 1937 Vincent Rapide for sale on the south coast. 'He said it was in bits in a box and that the seller wanted £50 for it. 'Back then £50 was a lot of money and I was still a student. I asked my dad for the money but it was about four times his mortgage and he said no. 'Seeing as I couldn’t buy the bike I phoned a friend of mine, John Lumley, and told him about it. 'John was a bit older and had a good job so he could afford to buy it.' Time capsule: The classic bike arrived in two tea chests and had to be assembled by Brian from scratch . Time and effort: Brian spent eight months and more than £10,000 restoring the Vincent . 'He went to see the seller and managed to knock a tenner off so he got it for £40. 'We remained friends and every few years when I would see him I would joke that I had the £40 to buy the bike now, and he would just smile at me.' Mr Hill said he had no idea that John would have been so generous as to leave the much sought-after Vincent to him. He added: 'It was very sad to hear John had died but at the same time I was told he had kindly left me the same Vincent Rapide I had told him about all those years ago. 'I was incredibly touched by the gesture. When the bike arrived it was still in bits, in exactly the same condition it was in in 1968. 'I never thought for one moment that after 40-odd years I would own the very same bike. I knew John would have wanted me to use the bike so I spent £10,000 restoring it over eight months. 'It is a beautiful bike that still turns heads 75 years after it was made. I’m determined to get out and ride it as much as I can - it’s what John would have wanted.' Vincent Motorcycles were once among the most desired models in the world. The company was founded in 1928 by Philip Vincent after he acquired a small motorbike manufacturing firm by the name of HRD Motors. Based in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, engineers built high-speed motorbikes primarily for the expanding market in the United States. In 1948, the 'Black Shadow' was hailed as the world's fastest production-made motorcycle. A 1952 998cc model set a six-hour world speed record at more than 100mph - an incredible achievement for the era. The tiny British company was so far ahead of its time, it wasn't until the 1970s that Japanese manufacturers came along with faster production machines. Vincent Motorcycles was forced to cease production in 1955 after suffering heavy financial losses. But the fantastic machines built in just 27 years of production have become a cult favourite among enthusiasts and collectors. A string of models have recently sold at auction for more than £200,000. Earlier this year, a Black Lightning model sold at auction for a whopping £246,000.","Brian Hill, of Longfield, Kent, spotted a Vincent HRD on sale for £40 in 1968 .

Mr Capstick told Channel 4 that he and a group of . other walkers had seen two troops making slow progress as they passed in . the opposite direction. ‘One of the soldiers made a . compassionate plea for some drinking water for his colleague,’ he said. ‘I don’t think it occurred to us that fatalities were going to result. ‘But it certainly was slightly odd . that the two soldiers in particular had bunched together and were . clearly in distress. That caused a little bit of alarm among us. ‘But it was a military exercise and you do expect, I suppose, that they are under duress and discomfort.’ Mr Capstick said one soldier was ‘upset’ and asked for water for his colleague rather than himself.

He was struck by a recovery truck, which the toddler's family claimed was going faster than the 30mph speed limit. Mohamed was taken to hospital but died from his injuries. The toddler’s mother Hayat Sharif said last night: ‘My husband was going to take Mohamed to the park before he started nursery at one o’clock. ‘The whole family was inside when I heard my husband shouting.  I ran outside and saw my husband sitting by Mohamed’s body saying, “He’s dead, he’s dead”.’ The 45-year-old mother-of-five said cars always speed down the residential road, and called on authorities to reduce the speed limit from 30mph to 20mph.

A mother and her four children had to flee their beds in the middle of the night when a toy Jeep caught fire in a freak blaze. Denise Gilpin had bought the pink children's Jeep as a surprise present for her daughter Ella-Rose’s fifth birthday on Sunday. She hid it in the garden under a 15ft trampoline next to a pushchair, bike and football kit because she had no room in their house. Shock: Five-year-old Ella-Rose Gilpin had no idea she was getting a toy Jeep for her birthday until the family had to evacuate the house after when it burst into flames . But the Rocket RS Sports Kids Ride-on-Jeep, which cost £139.99, caught fire at 3.30am on Friday morning after a suspected electrical fault - sending Denise and her kids running for safety as their fire alarms sounded. The flames were perilously close to the house at Catterick Garrison, North Yorkshire, and just feet away from an outdoor barbecue with gas canister. Denise said: 'The smoke was billowing from the garden and all I could see was this bright orange light. 'We had our windows open because it was a hot night and it could have easily caught onto our curtains. Freak fire: The Rocket RS Sports Kids Ride-on-Jeep was hidden under the trampoline outside - both of which were destroyed by the fire . The fire in the back garden resulted in the family being evacuated from their home in the middle of the night. The flames were so close to the home that the window sills were melted . 'We quickly evacuated outside of the house, and called the fire brigade. When they arrived, they couldn’t believe how much of a lucky escape we had. 'The barbecue gas canister and gas boiler could have easily exploded and the fire was powerful enough to melt the windowsills on the kitchen.' A single fire crew quickly put out the blaze with a hose reel but it caused damage put at £900 and wrecked the toy, pushchair, bike, football kit and the trampoline. Denise - mum to sons Jamie, 20, and Nathan, 18, and daughters Cheyanne, 12, and Ella-Rose, four - had bought the jeep online from Amazon. Denise Gilpin said she was shocked when the manufactured offered her a replacement . She rang them as soon as their offices opened at 6am and they initially offered her an exchange but have since changed that to a refund. Unemployed Denise, who is currently going through a divorce, said: 'This jeep could have easily killed us. The kids could have been playing on the trampoline. 'I was shocked with disbelief when they offered me a replacement - they should be taken it off the shelves.' She added: 'The Jeep was supposed to be an amazing surprise for Ella-Rose, but that has now been ruined. 'We’re just so lucky that we have not been injured or seriously hurt as it could have been so much worse.' A spokesman for manufacturers Fun4Kids said: 'To say I am a little surprised to hear this would be an understatement. 'I am very familiar with this item which complies fully with European and British safety standards. I have never heard of a battery bursting into flames/exploding materials in my eight years of selling toys I have never come across anything such as this. 'Nonetheless I would like to get to the bottom of the matter. 'We would like to arrange to inspect the complete vehicle so we can carry out further tests to establish exactly if and how this could happen. 'We take matters of safety very seriously and wish to investigate this to the full extent.'

Prime Minister Joseph Muscat has called on his European Union partners for help with the immigration crisis . Malta is overwhelmed by the ‘unsustainable’ numbers of migrants arriving on its shores, the country's Prime Minister has warned. In a desperate appeal to other EU leaders, centre-left leader Joseph Muscat said the boatloads of Africans arriving created 'a national security problem ’. The Mediterranean island, with a population of just 400,000, has become the landing point for many of the migrants seeking a new life in Europe. Since the beginning of the Arab . Spring tens of thousands have made the journey, often in overcrowded and . dangerous wooden boats. Many arrive in Malta or the Italian island of . Lampedusa, hoping to gain access to other parts of the European Union. Speaking . in Rome, Mr Muscat said Malta was being forced to accept a number of . migrants equivalent to 800,000 migrants to the UK or a million to . Germany or Spain. In the past year some 2,000 immigrants have arrived on the island by boat, he said. He said: ‘The people of Malta are not racist and welcome multiculturalism. We are in favour of integration. ‘But the burden should not fall on two countries, one of which is the smallest country in the EU,’ he said. Malta’s situation is even worse than . Lampedusa’s, because the migrants who arrived on the Italian island stay . only a few days before they are transferred to Sicily, he said. Under EU rules, those that land in Malta are not allowed to leave the country. Boatloads of refugees land on the paradise beaches of Malta in search of a life in Europe but the island's prime minister has warned the numbers has created 'a national security problem' Having . helped to bail out the banks of his European neighbours Malta, which . contributes three per cent of its GDP to the EU, more than any other . country, expected more ‘solidarity’ from EU countries, he said. Mr Muscat said: ‘Empty words on solidarity are no longer enough. We have happily bailed out Greece..then Cyprus. ‘Europe was quick in rescuing banks but too slow in rescuing people.’ The . European Court of Human Rights last week forced Malta to cancel two . flights repatriating migrants to Libya after an 11th hour appeal by . NGOs. The NGOs said this was the same policy of ""push back"" that was declared illegal by the court after it was used by Italy in 2009. Today, Mr Muscat said the deportation of migrants to Africa was still a possibility. ‘We cannot rule out any options’ he said.

Tragedy: Mark Hemmings died in agony after being continually refused an ambulance to take him to hospital . A vulnerable man died in agony from gallstones after his desperate pleas for an ambulance to hospital were refused by a 999 call handler who told him to take a warm bath instead. Mark Hemmings died just 30 minutes after he eventually arrived at hospital - two days after he first telephoned the emergency services for help. The 41-year-old had been struck down with painful gallstones, which could have been cured with a routine operation. Mr Hemmings had called for an ambulance on March 29 this year and later tried spoke to an out-of-hours GP. He was finally rushed to University Hospital of North Staffordshire on April 1 - but suffered a fatal heart attack triggered by gallstones blocking his pancreatic duct. To add to his devastated family's distress his 60-year-old mother Sylvia passed away at the hospital on the same day. Mr Hemmings, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, begged a 999 operator three times for an ambulance during the first seven-and-a-half minute call but was refused each time. At one stage the dispatcher even told him to call back if he fell unconscious before dismissing his moans as stomach ache. Eventually the operator said: 'From what you've told me you don't need an ambulance.' But the desperate patient replied: 'But I'm in agony.' He was then advised to take a warm bath to ease the pain and the case was passed on to an out-of-hours GP. Mark waited 90-minutes before the doctor called him back, and told the medic he was in agony and about to pass out in a three-and-a-half minute conversation. Desperate: After two days of asking for help, Mr Hemmings was taken to The University Hospital of North Staffordshire (pictured), but within 30 minutes he was dead . But the doctor refused to come and see him, ordering Mark - who lived alone and could not drive - to get to a surgery. When he failed to turn up for the appointment his records were marked 'did not attend' and no further checks were made on his condition. The 41-year-old was not seen until a care worker found him writhing in agony on the floor of his home on April 1 and called 999. Close friend Dean Rowley, 40, who had been visiting Mark's mother in hospital on the day when mark arrived in A&E said: 'I was really close to Mark when we were boys and even though we drifted apart, I stood over his body and vowed for old times' sake to find answers to what had gone wrong as there is no-one else around to do it. 'What should have been a simple operation was never allowed to happen because he could not get an ambulance. 'His great distress and pain is clear from the calls. 'He even mentions gallstones on both calls but even that didn't bring an ambulance. 'Because he doesn't give the right answers there are catastrophic failings in the emergency system. 'He was trying to do the decent thing and answer the questions honestly - but that did not pay. 'Astonishingly no-one even asks if he is on his own or vulnerable. 'I had a real battle getting the transcripts and won't give up now to make sure no-one suffers in the same way.' Bond: Dean Rowley, left, promised his friend Mark Hemmings, pictured right aged 11 in 1982, that he would try to expose what happened before he died this year . A post-mortem discovered that Mark died after his pancreatic duct was blocked by gallstones. West Midlands Ambulance Service has defended their handling of the case, saying they followed 'national guidelines.' A spokesman said: 'The call was assessed using national guidelines based on the information provided by the caller. 'As a result the patient's condition was judged not to be immediately life-threatening. 'To try to assist the patient, the call-handler made the necessary arrangements for an out-of-hours GP to contact the patient. 'We had no further contact until two days later when a further 999 call was received. 'On this occasion an ambulance and a rapid response vehicle were dispatched, arriving within six minutes. 'Unfortunately, despite best efforts, the man died shortly after arrival at hospital. 'The trust has carried out a full investigation which determined that the calls were handled correctly. 'As part of the process, we have organised a multi-agency meeting with senior clinicians and the family to further discuss the circumstances and establish if any lessons can be learnt.' CALL 1 .

C-H: 'OK I appreciate that but from the answers you've given me you don't need an ambulance but you need to speak to the local GP in the next two hours.' M: 'Do I need to go to the hospital?' C-H: 'No, you need to stay on the phone for a moment. You could try a warm bath but if you collapse, become unconscious, unresponsive, faint, cold or clammy it's 999.

George Zimmerman's lawyers have revealed that the former neighborhood watch volunteer could bring his own lawsuits following his not guilty verdict. Speaking on Good Morning America on Monday, attorney Don West said that Zimmerman, who was cleared of murdering 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, is considering taking action over how his case was handled. 'If you look at this case and take away the emotion of the loss of Trayvon Martin's life... and look at what happened, we have a lot of political and social pressures that [we] normally would not... and there may be compensation for something like that,' West said. He added that they could potentially take legal action over the way Zimmerman was prosecuted, who decided to bring the charges against him 'and everything that's happened to George Zimmerman'. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Attorneys Mark O'Mara (left) and Don West (right) said Zimmerman could bring his own suits following his not guilty verdict on Saturday. They said that he now lives in fear . The charges and subsequent witch hunt came despite the Sanford Police initially choosing not to charge him because of a lack of evidence, he said. It comes as the attorneys said they would now be pursuing action against NBC for how it edited the 911 calls Zimmerman made to dispatchers the night of February 26, 2012. The edited tapes depicted Zimmerman as a racial profiler after he came across the teenager walking through a Sanford neighborhood to his father's home, armed with nothing but a bag of sweets. On March 27 last year, NBC aired a version of the tapes which said: 'This guy looks like he's up to no good. He looks black.' In fact, the full tape showed Zimmerman had only said Martin was black when asked by a dispatcher. Anger: George Zimmerman, pictured with West in court on Friday, could seek for compensation over how he was treated following Trayvon's death, his lawyers have said . George Zimmerman's call to 911: . Zimmerman: 'This guy looks like he’s up to no good. Or he's on drugs or something. It's raining and he's just walking . around, looking about.' Dispatcher: 'OK, and this guy - is he black, white . or Hispanic?' Zimmerman: 'He looks black.' NBC version, aired March 27, 2012 . Zimmerman: 'This guy looks like he's up to no good. He looks black.' 'This guy looks like he’s up to no good,' Zimmerman said on the tapes. 'Or he's on drugs or something. It's raining and he's just walking . around, looking about.' The dispatcher asked: 'OK, and this guy - is he black, white . or Hispanic?' Zimmerman said: 'He looks black.' He sued NBC for defamation over the editing last December, but the case was put on hold pending the outcome of the trial. NBC maintained that other media outlets had also highlighted the racial angle of the killing, and said that if he was convicted, this would show Zimmerman's loss of reputation was his own doing, rather than that of any media outlet. With no conviction brought, Zimmerman is now ready to move forward with the suit, one of his lawyers told the Washington Post. 'We’re going to start in earnest asap, we just have to get the stay lifted which is a ministerial act,' James Beasley said. Outrage: Averri Liggins, 22, of Atlanta, holds a picture of Trayvon Martin during a protest over the verdict . He added that the verdict had shown the jury did not believe Zimmerman was a racial profiler and now 'it's simply time for us to start the case and hold accountable anyone who was irresponsible in their journalism'. Zimmerman's lawyers said on GMA that due to the charges, Zimmerman's life is forever changed. Following the verdict, protests have erupted across the country and their client is now fearful. 'I think he's aware of [the anger . against him], he's been aware of it for 16 months,' Mark O'Mara said. 'He’s become the focus of a lot of people's dismay, disgust, anger about . the event that happened that night.' Asked . if Zimmerman was scared, O'Mara added: 'Absolutely. He's been scared . for 16 months and with anger like this I think he has good reason to be . worried.' Protest: Throngs of marches arrive at Times Square in New York City on Sunday in protest of the verdict . Rage: A man shouts during a protest march against the acquittal in Los Angeles, California on Sunday . West dismissed calls for Zimmerman's gun to be seized - because now he needs it more than ever. 'I don't know how he could not lawfully carry a gun at this point since he has been lawfully allowed to carry one,' he said. 'This is the worst time in his life isn't it?' Protests have spread across the country in the wake of the sensational not-guilty verdict. Demonstrations - from Florida where the trial took place to Atlanta, DC and New York - remained largely peaceful, though Los Angeles protesters managed to shut down an entire freeway and thousands of New Yorkers mobbed Times Square and blocked traffic for an hour. Emotional crowds screamed 'Justice for Trayvon' and carried signs that likened the struggle of the slain teen and his supporters to that of the original civil rights movement.",NBC edited call 'to make it look as if Zimmerman was racial profiling'
"By . Duncan Farmer . PUBLISHED: . 16:00 EST, 13 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:07 EST, 13 July 2013 . Dusk is a wonderful time in the grounds of Lower Barton, a luxurious thatched house deep in the Devon countryside. As the sun sets over Dartmoor and the treetops of Haldon Forest are bathed in the day’s last light, a herd of fallow deer gather in the back garden. While the fawns, only weeks old, gambol in the meadows, the older bucks and does munch apples from the hands of owners Barry and Marthe Gomer. Close to nature: Marte Gomer, 58, feeds the deer at Lower Barton which her and her husband are now selling for £900,000 . By the time night has fallen, the deer have retreated to the woods, and an even more magical show begins. Beneath the window of a downstairs bedroom a group of badgers is clawing at the wall, waiting for Marthe and Barry to arrive with treats of bird nuts and the odd Malteser, which they chomp noisily. The bolder ones even poke their snouts through the cat flap, and when feeding time is over they use the decking as a race track. ‘They started coming into the garden and eating nuts that had fallen from the bird-feeders and then they came closer to the house,’ says Marthe, 58, a journalist. ‘We get pheasants in the kitchen and every morning Barry has to move the buck that sleeps next to his car. If I go for a walk in the fields and woods, fallow deer, cats, pheasants, the occasional badger and two robins trail along behind me.’ Thatched dream: The garden outside the three-bedroom Devon home is frequently visited by the local wildlife . The deer have been giving birth recently and the garden doubles as a creche. ‘Fawns are the funniest, cutest creatures you can imagine – a bit like lambs but even faster and more bouncy,’ says Marthe. ‘And every year we get to watch the rut, in which the bucks fight for supremacy, from the comfort of our armchairs. The noise and bellowing is terrific.’ The couple bought the detached three-bedroom house with 12 acres in 1999 for £280,000, and gradually the local fauna joined them. ‘We decided to buy it before we’d been inside – we’d arranged to meet the estate agent and arrived early, so walked around the garden and found a fawn asleep in the grass,’ says Marthe, who is selling the house through Savills (01392 455755) for £895,000. Although the animals are far from tame, they seem unfazed by human activity. ‘We can have as many as 30 friends eating outside with a herd of deer grazing next to us,’ says Barry, 62, a photographer. ‘We don’t cosset them – we just let them be themselves and that’s what makes it so special.’ High ceilings: The upstairs sitting room at Lower Barton which sits above the pretty village of Higher Ashton in the Teign Valley, seven miles from Exeter . Unexpected guests: When current owner Marthe cooks in the 28ft long, kitchen, she is often visited by the near-tame deer heard, looking for food . The delightful cottage garden has been . fenced to prevent damage from deer, but when dormice set up home in . Barry’s vegetable garden he left them there and has not picked up his . hoe since. Lower Barton sits above the pretty village of Higher Ashton in the Teign Valley, seven miles from Exeter. Internally, the house is a blend of ancient and contemporary. It was built 20 years ago in the style of a country cottage but has high ceilings, large rooms, vast windows and the mod cons not usually associated with thatched houses – as well as underfloor heating and air-conditioning, the house has a Jacuzzi. It is all rather surprising as the house was originally conceived as a modest dwelling for a part-time pig-breeder, but when his business went under it was repossessed and the Gomers stepped in. The kitchen, 28ft long, is the hub of the house and has views over their land and beyond, and when the deer see Marthe at the sink they amble to the window in search of food.

As well as the formal gardens and meadows, the grounds encompass forestry and a brook from which the deer drink. It is hard to see why the couple want to move from this idyllic spot, but they are house-hunting in France. They admit they’ll struggle to find something as beautiful and they will not find the wildlife, as the French tend to shoot anything on four legs. Their cat, Wally, will also miss his playmates. ‘He hides in the long grass until the bucks graze close enough for him to launch himself at their heads,’ says Barry. ‘Then he hangs on until they shake him off  and he’s somersaulted away before making a mad dash for the safety of the house with a buck in full flight right behind him.’","Lower Barton in Teign Valley, Devon is on the market for £900,000 .

A dead whistleblowing lawyer who exposed huge official corruption in Russia was today found guilty of tax evasion by a Moscow court. Sergei Magnitsky was convicted in the 'show trial' alongside British-based William Browder, the head of the Hermitage Capital investment fund, who was tried in absentia. The verdicts are expected to be widely condemned by Western governments and human rights organisations. Convicted: The verdict against Sergei Magnitsky, left, and William Browder, right, came as no surprise . The posthumous case is seen in the US and EU as raising serious issues about the rule of law in Moscow, while also highlighting the dangers faced by Russians who challenge the authorities. 'This show trial confirms that Vladimir Putin is ready to sacrifice his international credibility to protect corrupt officials who murdered an innocent lawyer and stole $230million from the Russian state,' said Hermitage Capital in a statement. 'I did not doubt that the decision would look like this,' said Magnitsky family lawyer Dmitry Kharitonov.  'I know that he committed no crimes.' The case against Magnitsky - who died four years ago - is now closed but judge Igor Alisov was expected to announce a jail sentence for US-born British citizen Browder. The cage in the Tverskoy District Court,  where the accused would normally sit, was empty for the entire trial. Magnitsky died in detention aged 37 of untreated pancreatitis in 2009, after accusing  interior ministry officials of organising an elaborate $235-million tax scam. He was then charged with the very crimes he claimed to have uncovered. Browder insists Magnitsky was tortured to death with beatings and the refusal of proper medical care, and has vowed have those he alleges were behind the plot brought to justice. The caged off seating where defendants would normally be seen is left empty during the bizarre 'trial' Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied Magnitsky was beaten to death, insisting the lawyer died of heart failure . The Kremlin's human rights council agreed there was evidence the lawyer was beaten to death. Putin rejected this saying last year that he died of heart failure. Browder  was formerly a supporter of  Putin who headed an investment fund that was one of the biggest foreign investors in Russia. Now he is a vocal critic of Russian authorities and successfully lobbied for the 'Magnitsky Act' in the US which bans officials implicated in the lawyer's death and corruption case from visiting the US, and freezes their assets. The law caused a storm with Moscow retaliating by refusing to allow Russian children to be adopted to the US. The case against Magnitsky had been closed after his death but re-opened in 2011 despite strong objections from his family. State-appointed lawyers represented the dead man in the trial, though were frequently absent from hearings.","Verdict expected to be condemned by Western governments .

Mohammed Sidda, 67, fell foul of planning regulations in Bolton, Greater Manchester, and must now pay £120,000 to demolish the entire detached house. At April’s hearing at Bolton Town Hall, Dr Sidda’s barrister claimed the issue was due to the fact he had been ill and that his inexperienced son had been left to project manage the construction. Must come down: A retired doctor has been ordered to demolish his dream five-bedroom home (above) after planning bosses ruled it was 'overbearing' But after weeks of deliberation, government planning inspector Richard Perrins threw out the appeal, saying the development had caused 'unacceptable harm to the character and appearance' of the area. He insisted the demolition order must be carried out in the next six months. Dr Margaret Collier, chairman of Lostock Residents’ Group, said: 'This has been a very difficult situation for the applicant and neighbours alike.

'Neighbours are relieved that the planning inspector has upheld the view of Bolton Council.' Dr Sidda had a bungalow bulldozed on the site and had the new house built in 2011. A Bolton Council spokesman said: 'We understand that Dr Sidda has invested a lot of money in this development, and sympathise with his circumstances. 'Nevertheless, planning regulations are in place to protect local residents and the environment against inappropriate developments. 'This property differs significantly from the plans approved, and the Inspector has agreed with the council and local residents that as a result it is unacceptable in its setting, and the only remedy is for it to be demolished.' Bolton Council planning officer Andrew McGlone said: 'It has an overbearing nature, not only (when seen) from Regent Road but from two minor highways either side of the site.' Dr Sidda had worked for the NHS for 34 years before retiring on medical grounds and had undergone a kidney transplant. Dr Sidda was not available for comment.

British fashion photographer Miles Aldridge has pictured some of the world's most beautiful women for Vogue covers and style spreads. While those shoots are often all about beauty and clothes, now he is giving an insight into his own mind with a new exhibition at London's Somerset House showcasing his more creative - and some what darker - side. His collection of technicoloured dream-like scenes of women contrast beauty with tragedy and drama, such as a smashed objects, silent screaming and implicit violence. Venus Smiles #8: Miles photographs Cara Delevingne in dramatic lighting, constrasting her beauty with the blank expression on her face . 'Actress #6': Within the technicoloured perfect world is inserted a disturbing glimpse of extreme emotion . The works, some of which have never been seen before, will be on display at London's Somerset House this summer. 'I . Only Want You to Love Me' is a major retrospective of Aldridge's work, to . coincide with the publication of the book by the same name. Women and colour have long been . Aldridge’s twin obsessions, and he has photographed some of the most . stunning women in the world, including model-of-the-moment Cara . Delevingne. His work is filled with glamorous, . beautiful women posing as dazed housewives and decadent beauties or . sunbathing sexpots and ecstatic Virgin Marys. 'Tan Lines #4': Combining beauty with explicit sexuality Miles pictures a beautiful model fondling herself and sucking an ice lolly . However . viewers will notice that the colourful world of seemingly perfect women . with blank expressions belies a deeper sense of disturbance and . neurosis. Look more closely and there is silent screaming, a head pushed . down on a bed, a face covered in polythene, a woman pushing an empty . swing. The artist revealed the sentiment behind his striking images in an interview with the Daily Telegraph earlier this year. He . said: 'These women aren't blank because they have nothing to say. They . are blank because they're overwhelmed by their world. When somebody is . thinking, they look blank. And it's that moment that I'm trying to . capture. 'When . somebody looks lost in thought they're vulnerable, and you're able to . intrude on that privacy and take a photograph that captures this human . being using their brain, trying to clarify how they got to this . position. 'Why are . they at the sink washing up, or in the playground pushing a swing with . no child in it? To me, the great moments in Hollywood are close-ups of a . woman's face, thinking, and she's just realised that her whole world is . wrong.' The exhibition has been timed to coincide with the book 'I Only Want You to Love Me' by Miles Aldridge . Aldridge’s influences include film . directors such as David Lynch, Alfred Hitchcock and Federico Fellini; the styled elegance . of fashion photographer Richard Avedon and the psychedelic illustrations . of his father, Alan Aldridge. Each . image is immaculately crafted, often starting with story-board drawings . so that the final image lies somewhere between cinema and photography. Luscious colours dazzle from every image – blood red ketchup splashes . against a black and white floor; a mouth drips with gold; egg yolk oozes . across a plate. Miles . will also share an in depth and personal view of his 15 years spent in . the fashion world in an exhibition running alongside the Somerset House . show, called Short Breaths. Not drawing a blank: Miles Aldridge at the opening of his exhibition. He said he aims to show that women are not vacant but thinking by their expression . Unhappy ending: Miles Aldridge and his model wife Kirstin McMenamy at their wedding in 1997, they are now getting divorced . Born in London in 1964, Aldridge studied illustration at Central St Martins, and briefly directed music videos before becoming a fashion photographer in the mid-90s. He has published his work in many influential magazines including Vogue Italia, American Vogue, Numéro, The New York Times and The New Yorker.

Ariel Castro now faces hundreds of new charges relating to the abduction and imprisonment of three young girls in his Cleveland home for about a decade. The 977-count indictment against Castro includes charges of rape and kidnapping and two counts of aggravated murder on accusations that Castro starved and punched one of the women while she was pregnant until she miscarried. The indictment does not include charges that could carry a death sentence, but Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Tim McGinty said he is still reserving that option. In chains: Castro, seen here at an earlier hearing, now faces 977 charges relating to the abduction and captivity of three young women and one of their children . Castro, 53, is charged with kidnapping the three women and holding them captive — sometimes restrained in chains — along with a 6-year-old girl he fathered with one of them. Castro pleaded not guilty to an earlier 329-count indictment. Castro is charged with two counts of aggravated murder related to one act, saying he purposely caused the unlawful termination of the pregnancy of one of the women. The new indictment also charges him with 512 counts of kidnapping, 446 counts of rape, seven counts of gross sexual imposition, six counts of felonious assault, three counts of child endangerment and one count of possessing criminal tools. Monster: Two of the most serious charges that Castro faces are two of aggravated manslaughter when he allegedly punched and starved one of the women until she miscarried a child .

If you've ever queued in a shop in the UK, waiting to be guided to an available cashier, chances are you've heard his measured tones. In a long and slow-moving queue, you may even have wondered about the person behind the voice directing the people in front of you to 'cashier number three, please' - was he real, or perhaps computer-generated? Today, the man behind the voice is revealed as Terry Green, 53, a father-of-one businessman from Stratford-upon-Avon. Scroll down for video . Wait your turn: Terry Green, 53, is the man whose voice controls millions of shoppers in queues across the UK . Every month, an estimated 30m queuing customers are guided by his voice in 8,000 UK outlets including M&S, Waitrose, Boots and the Post Office.  Others stores you will hear Mr Green's voice in are Lloyds TSB, TK Maxx, and Matalan. And Mr Green is not only the voice of the automated queuing system, but he invented it. The company he co-founded, Qmatic, devised what they called 'customer flow management' in the 1980s to help queues become faster and fairer. The system is now used to control roughly a quarter of the world's population - 1.75bn people - in shops around the globe, although Mr Green's voice is only used in the UK. Despite his global success Mr Green, who sold his stake in the company but remains involved as a consultant, has never yet been unmasked. But he is still often recognIsed by his voice alone. He said: 'My claim to fame is a famous voice - and a less-famous face. Post offices across the country use Terry Green's voice to keep the queues fairer and moving faster . 'If you wander up and down most High Streets in this country you’ll hear me saying ""Cashier number three please"" and it does make your voice a bit recognisable. 'If I’m queuing in a shop talking on the phone and a person hears my voice they’ll say ""Gosh, these two voices sound the same"". 'The other day I was doing work for an NHS hospital and people were coming up to me and saying 'so you are the cashier number three person. Say it. Say it.' Divorced Mr Green co-founded Qmatic in 1981 to promote ‘customer flow management’ and counted the Post Office as the first organisation to use the linear queue system. The system has a button so retailers can choose between a male or a female voice, and there are several female voices to choose from, most of them done by professional voiceover artists. The business now has a global turnover of £50m and employs some 300 people, while Mr Green is still fascinated by customer service and wrote a book about it, You're Next, published in 2011. Mr Green says the customer service in queues is vital - and businesses who want to survive should take note . He said: 'You get very focused on how long queues take and how the service is being distributed so I do like to share my thoughts with shop staff. 'If I am in a shop and I get receive good service, I will congratulate the staff but if I receive bad service, I will definitely tell someone about it. 'I had to do it the other day when a friend was shopping for a sofa: the customer service was not great so in the end we bought it online.' Mr Green says despite the boom in online sales, keeping customers happy in stores is still vital. He said: 'We know that the worst thing about face-to-face experiences is badly organised queues. 'If the organisations don’t invest in making the experience as slick as it would be online, they are going to lose business, it’s as simple as that.' His company is now developing a mobile app for shoppers showing the lengths of queues in shops in a given area. Terry Green's is not the only voice we know even if we don't realise it. Travellers on the London Underground will recognise that of Emma Clarke, 42, who tells passengers to 'mind the gap' and warns them which stations are coming up next. Her voice has been used on the Tube since 1999 but in 2007 her contract for future announcements was terminated by staff who felt she had criticised them in an interview. Mind the gap: Most Londoners will be familiar with the dulcet tones of Emma Clarke, 42, on the London Underground . A professional voiceover artist from Cheshire, Ms Clarke is also the voice of many car sat-navs. Sara Mendes da Costa, 47, from Brighton, is the woman behind the Speaking Clock, the fourth holder of the position since the clock's inception in 1936. She was awarded the job in 2007 after a competition was held to find a new modern voice for the clock. Fans of the Lotto will recognise Alan Dedicoat's voice if not his face, as he is the man who announces the winning numbers.  With a catchphrase of 'And the bonus ball is...', Mr Dedicoat, 58, who lives in Harrow, worked his way up from regional radio and reads the news on Radio 2. Meanwhile Peter Dickson's voice is heard in many sitting rooms on Saturday nights - the 56-year-old is the voice of the X Factor.  The Belfast-born radio presenter and voiceover artist has also voiced campaigns for British Gas, Downton Abbey and Heinz.","Terry Green's voice directs 30m UK shoppers to available tills each month .

Trayvon Martin was walking home from 7-Eleven with Skittles and an Arizona iced tea on February 26, 2012 when he was confronted by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman and shot and killed. He was by many accounts an average American 17-year-old going about his business. In the 17 months since he death, the unarmed teenager has become the country's newest race icon. And supporters last night compared him to Emmet Till,the 14-year-old boy who was tortured and brutally murdered by two white men in Mississippi in 1955. Icons: Trayvon Martin, left, has been compared to Emeett Till - the 14-year-old boy who was tortured and brutally murdered by two white men in Mississippi in 1955 . Protestors have turned Trayvon Martin into a Civil Rights icon and argued that his death - and the way it was handled by law enforcement - was heavily influenced by him being a black teenage . The . acquittal of Zimmerman - a half white, half-Hispanic man charged with . murdering a black teenager - has helped create a racial tinder box. Trayvon's supporters say he was targeted because he was a black teenager . walking through a gated community. The attorney representing Trayvon's . attorney poured gasoline on the embers on Saturday night when he . compared Trayvon to Emmett Till and Medgar Evers. Both Till and Evers were two young African-Americans who were brutally murdered by racist whites in the Jim Crow South and whose killers were allowed to walk free by a corrupt, prejudiced justice system. The injustice brought international attention to plight of blacks in the South and helped spark the Civil Rights movement. 'Trayvon Martin will forever remain in the annals of history next to Medgar Evers and Emmett Till as symbols for the fight for equal justice for all,' Benjamin Crump declared at a press conference after Zimmerman's acquittal. Crump called for calm among supporters of Trayvon's family, but added that in 50 years, he believes the verdict by the all-female jury - all but one of whose members was white - would be remembered as an injustice similar to the acquittal of the men accused of killing Till. Till was a 14-year-old black boy by from Chicago was a said to have whistled at a white female shopkeeper when he was in Mississippi visiting family in 1955. Roy Bryant, the woman's husband, and his half-brother J.W. Milam abducted Till, tortured him, gouged out his eye and this shot him dead before dumping his body in a river. An all-white jury acquitted both men despite witnesses who put them at the scene of the murder. They brazenly later admitted to the killing in a magazine article. Milam died of cancer in 1980. Bryant succumbed to the same illness in 1994, having never served  prison time for the horrific killing. Thousands of protestors took to the streets in the spring of 2012 to demand that Zimmerman be arrested and tried for murder - which he ultimately was . Zimmerman's lawyers said he must remain in hiding because of the hundreds, perhaps thousands, of death threats he has received since he shot dead Trayvon . Evers was a 37-year-old civil rights campaigner who was shot in the back by  Byron De La Beckwith, a white supremacist, outside his home in Mississippi in 1963. An all-white jury failed to reach a verdict in the case against De La Beckwith. He went free or three decades until he was re-tried and convicted in 1994. In August 1955, 14-year-old Emmett Till was visiting his family in Mississippi from his home in Florida. At some point, he met 21-year-old Carolyn Bryant, the white owner of a grocery store and struck up a conversation. Accounts of what happened in the store vary. Some say young Till wolf-whistled at Bryant. Others say he grabbed her around the waist and asked her for a date. Still others say the conversation was completely innocuous. Either way, Carolyn was alarmed and told her husband, who vowed revenge on the boy who had 'disrespected' his young wife. Several nights later, Roy Bryant and his half-brother J.W. Milam abducted Till and took him to a family shed. Bryant later recounted in a magazine interview that it had been his intention to beat Till severely and 'scare' him. Instead, Till insisted he had had sexual encounters with white women . That was too much for Bryant, a white southerner. He recounted to a magazine reporter years later that he told Till: ''Chicago boy. I'm tired of 'em sending your kind down here to stir up trouble. God**** you, I'm going to make an example of you - just so everybody can know how me and my folks stand.' They tortured Till, gouged out one of his eyes and then shot him dead execution-style. They then tied a large metal fan to his neck with barbed wire and threw his body in a river. It was recovered days later. Till's murder caused international headlines - made all the more sensational by his mother's decision to keep the casket open at his funeral. Bryant and Milam were put on trial - but both were acquitted by juries comprised of only white men. Their lawyers argued that the body found was not Till's and that Till was never killed. They brazenly later admitted to the killing in a magazine article. Milam died of cancer in 1980. Bryant succumbed to the same illness in 1994, having never served  prison time for the horrific killing. Both cases proved pivotal in the U.S. Civil Rights movements, as they seemed to prove to the country - and to the world - that the Rule of Law didn't apply to blacks in the South. Crump implied on Saturday that Zimmerman's acquittal meant the same thing about the justice system in Florida. He was not alone. Dozens of supporters took Twitter to make the comparison, as well. 'Not guilty. No surprise. Another line in the indictment of America. From Emmett Till to Trayvon Martin, never forget,' tweeted Greg Carr, the chairman of the Howard University Department of Afro-American studies. 'Emmett Till whistled and Trayvon Martin had a hoodie on. They were both killed by white men. Different centuries same problem,' twitter user iBennyTruise wrote. 'Emmett Till all over again.Can’t believe this is where we are as a country. Florida has dragged America back 60 years,' another user said. Until Trayvon's fatal confrontation with Zimmerman, he seemed an unlikely symbol of the civil rights movement. Trayvon was a high school junior living with his mother Sabrina Fulton in Miami Gardens, Florida. He was suspended from school in February for possession of marijuana. Social media posts unearthed after his death reportedly show the teenager smoking the drugs. One picture that surfaced shows him with a semi-automatic handgun as well. Despite attempts by some supporters of Zimmerman to portray Trayvon as a juvenile delinquent, his family maintains he was a 'sweet and gentle' boy. During his suspension from school, he went to Sanford, Florida, to stay with his father and his father's girlfriend - who was renting a townhouse in the Retreat at Twin Lakes - a gates community where Zimmerman also lived. It was there - while Trayvon was walking home from a trip to 7-Eleven to buy an Arizona iced tea and Skittles - that he was spotted by Zimmerman. By all accounts, he was minding his own business and just returning home from the store. Supporters of Trayvon's family say the teen was targeted because he was black and had the hood on his black hooded sweatshirt up. Defense lawyers said that the 29-year-old Zimmerman - who was a neighborhood watch volunteer patrolling the community - was on sharp lookout after numerous break-ins in the area. He called the police and then tried to track down Trayvon. What's next remains in dispute. Zimmerman says the 6-foot-2 Trayvon turned and assaulted him and smashed his head against the sidewalk.That's when Zimmerman opened fire. Prosecutors argued that Zimmerman was the aggressor. Ultimately, the jury sided with Zimmerman and acquitted him on all charges. That has not stopped tens of thousands of protesting the decision - both online and in protests across the country. Even defense lawyers concede that there are many who will not accept the 'not guilty' verdict.","Supporters of Trayvon Martin have argued that the case was about race from the beginning .

A 47-year-old married mother who fled to Canada to avoid a 30 year jail sentence for having sex with a teenager faces being kicked out of the country. Denise Harvey, of Florida, was stripped off her refugee status by Canada's Federal Court and could be extradited back to the US to serve her sentence. Harvey has been told she had a final chance to argue that she should be allowed to stay. Denise Harvey, of Florida, must again make her case for refugee status in Canada after fleeing north of the border to avoid a 30-year prison sentence in the United States for underage sex . Harvey fled from her home in Florida in 2010 after being convicted of having sex with a 16 year old who was friends with her teenage son. She was sentenced to 30 years but while out on bail fled to Canada with her husband and family. She was granted refugee status after saying she faced 'cruel and unusual punishment' from the lengthy prison sentence. Canadian authorities agreed to allow her to stay ruling her actions would not constitute a crime if she had carried them out in Canada. In Canada, the age of consent is 16 unless the older person is in a position of authority over the younger person. The decision was appealed to the Federal Court of Canada who have now stripped Harvey of the refugee status. Prosecutors in Florida are hopeful that Harvey will soon return to serve her sentence. 'We’ve been actively pursuing her but of course we were dead-ended by the Canadian government who granted her refugee status,' said Nikki Robinson, assistant state attorney who was a prosecutor of the original case. 'I’m hoping we’ll see her back. We’ll follow it up with the U.S. Marshal’s Office.' Denise Harvey was arrested in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan (pictured) in April 2011 . Harvey, from Vero Beach, Florida, was convicted of having sex on multiple occasions with a 16 year old she met at her son's baseball matches in 2008 . She began flirting with him and the pair had sex on five occasions, including at the victim's home and in her office where she worked as a mortgage broker. The victim's sister tipped off police after she once walked in on them having sex. After police launched an investigation, Harvey was recorded telling the teen to lie to police and tried to blackmail his sister not to help authorities. After being sentenced to 30 years in jail in 2010 Harvey appealed, and when that failed she fled from Florida. She was arrested in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan in April 2011. Denise Harvey fled to Canada to avoid a 30 year jail sentence for having sex with a teenager (Canadian border control pictured near Vermont) Harvey claimed asylum and was granted refugee status - despite an extradition warrant from Florida authorities. The Immigration and Refugee Board found she was a person in need of protection as someone facing cruel and unusual punishment by Canada’s standards, imposed on her in disregard of accepted international standards. Canada’s Minister of Citizenship and Immigration sought to overturn that decision and the IRB was told it had not provided adequate reasoning on one element of its decision. That element referred to the accepted international standards. Harvey's lawyers have to show that the 30 year sentence if above what other countries would impose for under age sex charges. Lawyers for Harvey have not commented.","Denise Harvey fled her Florida home in 2010 after being convicted of having sex with a 16 year old boy .

Controversial: The 40 Group of MPs argue that a misunderstanding about the benefits system is encouraging some teenagers to have children (file picture) Teenage mothers should lose their benefits if they refuse to live at home with their parents, a group of Tory MPs warned today. David Cameron is urged to introduce tough sanctions on young women to stop the welfare system ‘encouraging them to have a child’. The 40 Group of MPs most at risk of losing their seats at the next election said benefits for teenage mothers should only be paid if they live at home or in special hostels. In a new book the MPs set out a raft of ideas for future Tory policy, including cutting child benefit for parents whose children repeatedly play truant, curbing wind farms and capping the number of non-EU foreign students entering the UK. The group hopes to broaden the appeal of the party, particularly in the north of England. In a foreward to the book, Mr Cameron says the ideas are 'interesting' and 'valuable'. But the Prime Minister added that party members would have 'inevitably different views' about them. The most controversial idea is the proposal to force teenagers with babies to live with their parents. The MPs claim that perceptions of the welfare state mean some young people to think wrongly think that if they get pregnant they will be entitled to free housing. This is ‘encouraging them to have a child’, the MPs argue. According to the BBC, the MPs suggest ‘all benefits to teenage mothers should be made on the condition of them living with their parents or in supervised hostel accommodation’. Interesting: The ideas have been sent to David Cameron, who today met the President of Burma Thein Sein, in Downing Street . Tory MP James Morris, a member of the . 40 Group, admitted the idea was ‘controversial but insisted tougher . action was needed to tackle the welfare state. He told the BBC: ‘I know this is a controversial idea, but it’s one of the ideas that is floated in the book. ‘There . has been a lot of progress made on teenage pregnancy over the last few . years; we still have high rates in comparison with our European . partners, so I think it’s one thing that the Government should be . looking at and the Conservative party should be looking at  as we look . forward to further welfare reform.’ Controversial: Tory MP James Morris said tackling welfare had to be a priority for the future . The 40 Group has been formed of the 40 MPs with the slimmest majorities, who could be most vulnerable at the next election. Mr Morris said in these crucial swing seats welfare reform is one of the top priorities. ‘It’s way up there as a priority and people are very concerned about benefits and the welfare system. ‘And the book we’ve published today is a book which is 40 ideas across the 40 most marginal seats across the country. ‘Welfare reform does form part of it and I think we can be pushing harder on looking at issues around teenage pregnancy, but the book is actually much broader than that. It has ideas around how to improve the health service and tackling the growing problems of mental health and mental illness.  So it’s a pretty mainstream book in terms of its ideas.'","New 40 Group of Tory MPs launch book of policies to win support in 2015 .

A group of climate change protesters who occupied one of the UK’s new gas-fired power stations for seven days have avoided jail sentences. Twelve women and nine men aged 23 to 46 from across the country admitted aggravated trespass after their sit-in at the EDF Energy West Burton power plant in Nottinghamshire last October. At an earlier court hearing the group had been warned that all sentencing options were open, but at Nottingham Magistrates’ Court today district judge Leo Pyle told them custodial sentences would not be imposed. No Dash for Gas activists and supporters outside Nottingham Magistrates Court before their sentence hearing. They had been told they could receive custodial sentences after staging a sit-in at a gas-fired power station . He said: 'It is right to say that I took into account the conscientious motives of all of you.'How this case is sentenced must be fact-based.' The judge said many of the defendants were highly educated men and women who had caring roles in the community, and added: 'Your motives were genuine but you knew what the boundaries were.' Following the announcement that the defendants, some of whom had previous convictions for similar offences, would not be going to prison they cheered and broke into applause in the court room. The campaigners from the No Dash for Gas group arrived in vans at the site in the early hours of October 29 last year. Equipped with climbing equipment and with enough food and drink to sustain them for a number of days, they made their way on to the premises through a hole in the security fence. They had planned the demonstration for around 10 months, and the action saw 16 activists occupy the flues of two of the chimneys at the site. While up there, they rigged a rope between the two chimneys and people were able to travel across and operate a supply line. They all handed themselves in to police at various points during and after the week-long protest.Prosecutor Colette Moore told the court: 'Five of the group were on the ground and detained in that way, the rest came down in the course of the next seven days. 'They were all detained quite peacefully, quite amicably.' The group said they were protesting against moves to build new gas-fired power stations such as West Burton, warning they would leave the UK dependent on a polluting and increasingly expensive fossil fuel for decades. The Government has backed the development of up to 20 gas-fired power stations as part of its strategy for future energy supplies. 'Your motives were genuine but you knew what the boundaries were,' - Judge Leo Pyle . Ministers said that continuing use of gas without technology to trap and permanently store carbon emissions is compatible with targets to cut greenhouse gases to tackle climate change. Arrests were made between October 29 and November 5, when the week-long protest came to an end. Five defendants were given an 18 month conditional discharge and ordered to pay costs of £85 and a £15 victim surcharge. Seven others were given community orders for 12 months and told to carry out 200 hours unpaid work. The remaining nine were were all given community orders for 12 months and told to carry out 150 hours unpaid work. They were all told to pay costs of £85 and a victim surcharge of £60. David Rhodes, defending the group, told the judge the defendants had asked him to pass on that the demonstration was not done on a 'whim' and had been carefully planned. 'The defendants have asked me to convey this was not a stupid prank, nor was it a self-aggrandising stunt,' Mr Rhodes said. 'Each of these defendants cares passionately about the damage being done to the planet by climate change. 'It’s something that drives them very deeply. This was something that had been considered very carefully.' The group considered the protest 'necessary', Mr Rhodes added. 'The sincerity in the integrity of their motivation is the most important mitigating factor,' he said. The defendants had spent weeks planning and practicing the protest and their climbing techniques, it was non-violent, and no permanent damage was caused, Mr Rhodes said. Asking the judge to not impose custodial sentences, he said some similar cases of political protests had seen individuals 'vindicated by history' and the defendants had acted out of the 'highest possible motives.' Operation: The group had planned the demonstration for around 10 months. It saw 16 activists occupy the flues of two of the chimneys at the site . He told the judge: 'These people must be marked out from the ordinary defendants who come before these courts on a daily basis because they come from conscientious motives.' In his sentencing remarks the judge said the 'mass act of aggravated trespass' had resulted in the loss of around £340,000 in labour after 655 workers were turned away from the site during the occupation, and delays in finishing the site cost around £5 million. A statement released by EDF following the sentencing said: 'EDF Energy’s civil case against the protestors was settled in March after they agreed to accept a permanent injunction preventing them from entering multiple EDF Energy sites. 'Following this agreement, the company dropped its claim for civil damages against the protestors.'EDF Energy has invited a range of groups and individuals - including No Dash For Gas - to discuss the company’s response to such demonstrations in future. 'This is being led by Will Hutton, Chairman of EDF Energy’s independent Stakeholder Advisory Panel, alongside panel member, Tamara Ingram. 'They will also be supported by an independent legal adviser. 'An advisory report will be presented to the Panel and the findings will be published in due course.'We share the protestors’ commitment to tackling climate change. That’s why we have committed to reducing the intensity of CO2 emissions from our electricity production by 60 per cent by 2020, and cutting the proportion of CO2 arising from our customers’ energy consumption by 15 per cent by 2020.

Because this is Spain's infamous running of the bulls, where thousands of daredevils race through the streets of Pamplona - with a herd of bulls hot on their heels. Runners - or 'mozos' - raced through the streets of the northern Spanish city of Pamplona today in a hair-raising but relatively clean second bull run of the famed annual San Fermin festival. Scroll down for video . People lean out of balconies to cheer on the brave runners as they dash in front of Alcurrucen's bulls during the first bull run of the San Fermin Festival . Run! The festival is a symbol of Spanish culture that attracts thousands of tourists to watch the bull runs despite heavy condemnation from animal rights groups . Look out! The annual Fiesta de San Fermin was made famous by the 1926 novel 'The Sun Also Rises' by Ernest Hemmingway . The daredevils - quickly followed by the bulls - run through the historic heart of Pamplona for nine days as part of the adrenalin-fuelled fiesta . There were no gorings in the run and four people were treated in city hospitals for injuries suffered in falls, Navarra Hospital chief Javier Sesma said. The early morning race saw thrill-seekers dashing alongside six fighting bulls and six bell-tinkling steers that try to keep the creatures together along the narrow 930-yard (850-meter) course from a holding pen to the city bull ring. Today's run lasted just over two minutes. The run is televised nationally and is the highlight of the nine-day street partying festival, which became world famous following the 1926 publication of Ernest Hemingway's novel 'The Sun Also Rises.' 'Never again,' said Jonathan . Chadwick, 31, an engineer from Auckland, New Zealand, who said it was . his 'first and last time' to run.

The bulls that are run each morning are invariably killed in evening bull fights . The heart-stopping run and subsequent parties were originally organised in honor of San Fermin, patron saint of Navarra . The origin of the controversial fiesta stems from the need to move the bulls from the off-site corrals to the bullring where they would be killed in the evening. Foolish youngsters would dash in amongst the creatures to prove their bravery. In Pamplona the festival is run to honour San Fermin, the city's saint, and runs between July 6 and 14. Runners wear red and white, ask San Fermin for protection, and hold rolled up newspapers in case they need to distract the bulls. They run from the corrals, through the streets, before finally ending in the bull ring. Each year hundreds of people are injured, and occasionally killed, in the fiesta. 'It was really scary,' he added. Ade Erinkitola, a 47-year-old IT worker from San Francisco said it was his first time but he'd be back. 'It was really exciting, my heart was beating really fast. I didn't know what to expect,' he said. Three Spaniards and a 41-year-old man from Pheonix, Arizona, were injured but none were in a serious condition, according to the Navarra regional government press office. The bulls that are run each morning are invariably killed in evening bull fights, and their meat is served up in Pamplona's restaurants. Animals rights groups have previously slammed the event, branding it cruel to the bulls forced to run. A PETA spokesman slammed the event, and called for a boycott of the annual festival.They said: 'In this day and age, it's appalling that sensitive animals are still being tormented and killed in front of a screaming crowd. 'PETA and Spanish group AnimaNaturalis are joining compassionate people from around the world in condemning this cruel blood sport – and in urging tourists to stay far away from the bullfights.' The heart-stopping run and subsequent parties were originally organised in honor of San Fermin, patron saint of Navarra, although the religious aspect has now faded.

When they finish they shout 'Viva San Fermin!, Gora San Fermin,' the official website said. This chant is sung three times before 8am, until the gates are opened and the bulls released. After the launching of two rockets, the bulls charge behind the runners for 825 metres, the distance between the corral and the bullring.

Although Pamplona is arguably the most famous of places for the running of the bulls, the tradition is carried out around Spain. But in one place, people ended up swimming, rather than running, with the bulls. Many jump into the sea during the traditional ''Bous a la Mar' festival in the eastern Spanish coastal town of Denia, near Alicante. Boats could be seen sailing up to the bulls to help guide them to shore afterwards. During this festival, revellers emerging from protective barriers provoke bulls to chase them until they both fall into sea. The bulls are then rescued by small boats which will tow them to safety.

A grandmother in Chicago is being charged with the murder of her 8-year-old granddaughter after firefighters discovered the girl dead at her home, with signs of long-term abuse. Gizzell Ford's body was cold when firefighters responded to a report Friday morning that the child was not breathing. The girl lived at her grandmother Helen Ford's apartment in the Austin area of Chicago, along with her bedridden father and two brothers, 12 and 9. Elder abuse: 8-year-old Gizzell Ford, left, was found dead Friday morning, from an apparent strangulation at the hands of her 51-year-old grandmother, Helen Ford, right . Authorities say Ford was the girl's only caregiver. An autopsy conducted Saturday revealed that the cause of death was strangulation and multiple blunt trauma injuries. The girl's death has been ruled a homicide. Responders found the girl laying on her back in a bedroom with her father. The grandmother denied killing the girl - saying that she had just fixed her a peanut butter and jelly sandwich when the girl complained about being sore. She told her to take a hot bath and got her some water to drink. It was then, Ford said, that the girl stopped breathing. Ford said the injuries on the girl's body were self-inflicted because she was upset her mom wasn't visiting. Ford also said that the mother's boyfriend abused Gizzell. Investigators recovered a pole, twine and cables from the apartment - some of which had blood on them, according to the prosecutor. Several other injuries on the girl's body show that this was a case of long term abuse. Strangled: The apartment building where Gizzell lived with her grandmother, bedridden father, and two brothers. She was found in a bedroom laying face up after being strangled . One head injury was so old that maggots had hatched in it and spread to the girl's scalp. Prosecutors listed several other injuries found on the girl's body at Ford's hearing on Sunday. They found a deep laceration on her buttocks, ligature marks on the girl's ankles and wrists and circular marks which may have been cigarette burns. There were cuts on her face, ears and lips, as well as bruises and puncture wounds on her back, chest and abdomen, with bruising on the front and back of her neck. Neighbors and friends of the grandmother were surprised to here of the possible long-term abuse of her grandchild. One neighbor told NBC Chicago that Ford must have just snapped because 'nobody never seen the woman do nothing wrong around here (sic).' At the court hearing Sunday another man  who said he knew the victim's father and knew Ford since he was in the 5th grade, didn't think she was capable of such abuse. 'It never seemed that way,' he said. But relatives of the victim's mother had another story. Gizzell's uncle Osvaldo Mercado told the Chicago Tribune that Ford kept the girl from her family. 'Helen blocked everybody,' Osvaldo said. She would say '""Gizzell can't talk - she's in the shower, or on punishment."" It was an excuse every time we called.' Remembered: Gizzell's uncle described the girl as smart and well mannered who loved being around her cousins . Mercado said he hadn't seen the girl since Easter. None of the girl's mother's family had been allowed to see her in recent months. Gizzell was supposed to go on a camping trip with her aunt the day she died, but her grandmother wouldn't allowed it, Mercado said. According to Mercado, Gizzell was smart and well-mannered. 'She was outgoing; she spoke to everybody,' he said. 'It was like one big party when she got together with her cousins.' Now, he wants justice and answers for her death. Ford is being held without bail on charges of first-degree murder . Gizzell's two brothers, who were in the care of their grandmother as well, have been placed into foster care. The Department of Children and Family Services is investigating both the grandmother and father for abuse and neglect of the three children.","Gizzell Ford, 8, was found dead at her grandmother's apartment Friday from strangulation and blunt-force injuries .

'Scrummy': Soprano Laura Wright has hit back at comments that classical singers are too thin . ‘Scrummy Soprano’ Laura Wright yesterday launched a war of words with Dame Kiri te Kanawa, describing her recent comments about singers being too thin as ‘stupid’. Dame Kiri, 69, stirred controversy last month when she said of young singers: ‘Sometimes they’re more beautiful than their voice, and that’s a bit of a sadness.’ She added: ‘When I was at the Met [in New York], I would see these young girls, starving hungry but terrified to put on weight. ‘They couldn’t even go down to the canteen and eat in front of anyone because they were being watched. ‘You have got to have beef on you if you’re going to sing.’ Laura, 23, who has sung for the Queen six times in the past year, said: ‘It is so stupid she has highlighted body stuff. ‘I find it strange that she is commenting on girls’ figures.’ ‘She pointed out sexualisation of young women in the classical industry and that frustrates me. ‘I just received my first-class degree at the Royal College of Music and at no point in my four-year course did my figure come into it. ‘For me it is about being healthy, I’m not thin or enormous, but just a sporty shape. I look after my vocal muscles and my other muscles as well and I don’t feel the pressure to diet to go on stage thin.’ The divas’ disagreement comes as both women take to the stage tonight in the last of the Coronation Jubilee Festival Gala evenings at Buckingham Palace. Wright’s reaction to Kiri’s comments are in stark contrast to Welsh star Katherine Jenkins conciliatory attitude about Dame Kiri’s scathing comments about ‘crossover’ singers such as herself. Dame Kiri told The Radio Times in May when Katherine’s name was mentioned: ‘We should talk about serious classical singers if you want to stick to the subject.’ Controversy: Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, pictured performing at the Coronation festival, has said modern young singers are 'more beautiful than their voice' Ms Jenkins, 33, who will also perform tonight, said: ‘I don’t think Dame Kiri ever says these things. I think she’s been misquoted, as is so often the case. ‘When I met her, she was a lovely person, so I’m going to ignore it.’ Meanwhile, Ms Wright has revealed that some of her tutors at the Royal College of Music believed that her heavy concert schedule would be a distraction from her studies. Despite her outstanding academic success, Laura added: ‘Some tutors at the College disagreed with what I have been doing and haven’t been supportive.’","Dame Kiri Te Kanawa said young singers cared too much about appearance .

It hardly looks like the most comfortable of places to build a home, but these two crows decided to build their nest on top of a yacht's mast. The pair of feathered home-makers obviously took the nautical term quite literally when they decided to make good use of the 'crow's nest' of a vessel moored at Aberystwyth harbour, in mid-Wales. Staff at the marina said it is the first time they have seen an actual crow's nest built on the top of a yacht's mast. What a position: These two birds obviously took the nautical term quite literally when they decided to build their home on the crow's nest of a yacht . The crows are understood to have built the nest about two weeks ago, but have only just started sitting in it this week indicating the possibility of eggs. As it looks to be a breeding pair, the crows may not yet number enough to be described by their collective name of 'a murder of crows' but should the eggs hatch, the yacht could quickly become an aviary. 'Why they'd want to build a nest there is beyond me,' said David Jenkins who works at the marina. 'There is a little platform at the top but it really does get windy in that spot with the strong north easterly winds. Bird's-eye view: Staff at Aberystwyth marina have said it is the first time they have seen an actual crow's nest built on the top of a yacht's mast . 'I've never seen anything like it in all my years working down at the marina.' The yacht in question is the 'Scorpio', which belongs to Tal-y-bont couple Mick and Jenny Fothergill. The couple suffered from the devastating effects of last June's flooding and as a result haven't used their yacht because they have been tied up with repairs at their home. 'That's probably why they chose it,' added Mr Jenkins. 'We've had a few ducks making nests on boats over the years but this was a one-off. 'Fingers crossed we might see some chicks, but the danger is then that other birds would continue to use it as a home!' Russell Jones, from RSPB Ynys-hir nature reserve near Machynlleth, said: 'This is a very unusual nesting site in such an open location. Crows usually nest in trees and bushes which give them some cover and protection. 'Although this site is high enough away from predators, another reason for choosing this spot could be because of easy access to food sources. 'The recent cold weather means that the breeding season has been pushed back slightly so they might be laying eggs over the next few days.'

A midwife failed to provide a first-time mother with basic medical attention during an agonising birth, a hearing has been told. Colleen Tyler yesterday told a Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) hearing that she asked midwife Julie Louise Richards for an epidural on multiple occasions as she gave birth to her son Noah. He was later born suffering from severe brain damage and died ten months later. Colleen and Hywel Tyler's first child, Noah, died at the age of ten months due to brain damage that he suffered during his traumatic birth in February 2011 . The misconduct panel was also told how the midwife had said Mrs Tyler ‘shouldn’t move around so much’ in the birthing pool and shouldn't ask if she should push - as she would know instinctively. Mrs Tyler said: ‘I didn’t know what to do and I didn’t have anyone who was going to tell me.’ Ms Richards denies a lack of communication with the patient. She is also accused of failing to recognise, or act on, the fact that Noah’s heart rate was too fast. The panel was told by Mrs Tyler and her husband, Hywel Tyler, that an epidural had been repeatedly requested, but was not given. Instead, Mrs Tyler spent three hours in a birthing pool. Unable to get comfortable, she spent much of the time sat on her hands in an attempt to steady herself in the pool. She said: ‘I didn’t want to get in the birthing pool. I said again and again that I wanted an epidural because the pain was that bad. Noah was starved of oxygen during his birth at the University Hospital of Wales, in Cardiff . Midwife, Julie Richards (pictured), is accused of failing to recognise that Noah's heart rate was too fast. She is also said to have failed to communicate properly with Mrs Tyler during the birth . ‘I just wanted an epidural so that I didn’t have to be feeling the pain anymore. In the end, I didn’t have the energy to keep asking.’ An inquest held last year found that Noah had suffered devastating brain damage after he was starved of oxygen and blood during his delivery at the University Hospital of Wales’ midwife-led unit in Cardiff in February 2011. He died 10 months later as a result of the injuries sustained at birth. At the time, Cardiff coroner Mary Hassell criticised Ms Richards' failure to provide Mrs Tyler with ‘basic medical attention’. Mrs Tyler (left) claims that during the birth she begged Ms Richard to allow her to have an epidural but that she was not give one. She also says that the midwife told her not to move around so much in the birthing pool . In her evidence, Mrs Tyler spoke of the pain of having lost her first-born son. She said: ‘I feel cheated of my son, because he was robbed of the life and childhood that he had every right to have. ‘In this day and age and in a country that is so progressed - that level of care, or lack of care, should never happen. If this had happened to someone else, I wouldn’t believe something like this could happen.’ Giving evidence, Ms Richards, who no longer works for the University Hospital of Wales, apologised to the family for the part she played in their son’s death. She said: ‘I really can’t express how sorry I am for their loss and for my part in it. During an inquest into Noah's death, Cardiff coroner Mary Hassell criticised Ms Richards' failure to provide Mrs Tyler with 'basic medical attention' ‘It will be with me for every day for the rest of my life.’ The apology was first offered through her barrister, Mark Whitcombe, as Noah’s parents gave evidence. In response, Mr Tyler said: ‘That is the first time she has expressed any sort of apology to myself and my wife. ‘We have had apologies from the hospital and from the head midwifery, but this is the first time, over two years later, that she has expressed any sort of apology.’ Ms Richards has now apologised for the part she played in Noah's injury and eventual death . Ms Richards faces serious allegations relating to three separate incidents dating back to 2008. In the first, it is alleged she failed to recognise abnormally high blood pressure in a pregnant woman, or to inform medical staff in December 2008. Secondly, she is said to have booked a patient in to have her labour induced without following the hospital’s labour protocols, or completing full antenatal checks, in August 2009. In relation to Noah’s birth in February 2011, she is accused of failing to recognise or act on abnormal observations – which included that the baby’s heart rate was too fast - and to seek appropriate referral to a medical practitioner. She is also said to have failed to communicate effectively with Mrs Tyler while she was in the birthing pool. Ms Richards also faces serious allegations relating to two other incidents. She no longer works for the University Hospital of Wales (pictured) She is also accused to administering drugs which had not been prescribed by a doctor and without Mrs Tyler’s consent. Ms Richards admits the facts in all three cases, except where she is accused of a lack of communication. The panel is set to decide today whether, on the balance of probabilities, Ms Richards failed to communicate effectively with Noah’s parents. Later this week, the panel will decide whether Ms Richards’ fitness to practice is impaired by reason of her misconduct.","Julie Louise Richards is accused of failing to see Noah Tyler's heart rate was too high before his birth at the University Hospital of Wales in February 2011 .

Test: More than 3,000 Scouts aged 12 to 20 were required to meet a threshold for body mass index to be allowed to take part in 10 day camp at a new location in West Virginia . 'Part of the design in building this . site was to address the need for physical fitness in our youth, which of . course is a longstanding component of Scouting,' said Dan McCarthy, . director of the BSA's Summit Group. 'We . saw this as an opportunity to integrate some new challenges ... so we . deliberately spread the site to enable us to encourage Scouts and . basically require Scouts to move about the site by foot.' 'We required a level of fitness in order to come to the Jamboree that we haven't required before,' McCarthy said. 'And that has motivated an enormous return in terms of both kids and adults getting serious about improving their health.' Soon, the Scouts will know why. Besides offering a whole lot of fun, dozens of venues will test their physical skills and fitness. At some point during the Jamboree, every participating Scout will be asked to take a 3-mile trek up a mountain. New arrival: Tents that will house staff members at the Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve in Glen Jean, W.Va. Some 40,000 Scouts, leaders and others will descended on southern West Virginia for the first ever National Scout Jamboree today . Their reward: A barbecue waiting at the top. 'We certainly want to get the Scouts outdoors, challenge them and have a healthy lifestyle,' said Gary Hartley, the Summit's director of community and governmental relations. 'We talk about the three C's as kind of the pillars, and that is cardio, character and citizenship. We have all of those embodied here.' From 1981 to 2010, the Jamboree was held every four years in Fort A.P. Hill, Va. That gathering on a flatter, borrowed Army base limited the size and scope of the Jamboree's operations. In 2009, southern West Virginia was chosen out of 80 proposals from 28 states as the Jamboree's new home. Along with being the permanent home of the national Jamboree, whose theme is 'Go Big, Get Wild,' the Summit will serve as one of four high-adventure camps for the Scouts and will host the 2019 World Jamboree. 'We required a level of fitness in order to come to the Jamboree that we haven't required before' Dan McCarthy, director of the BSA's Summit Group. While Scouts will be roughing it outdoors, Hartley said walking won't be that rough. It's 1.5 miles from the furthest tent to the center of activity at the Summit, compared to 3 miles at Fort A.P. Hill. Even the short, casual stroll isn't meant to be boring. A 786-foot suspension bridge connecting two of the Summit's six base camps to one of the outdoor activity centers has catwalks on either side. The Summit's offerings are numerous. There are simple activities such as fishing on four different lakes. There's also the chance to get even wetter with whitewater rafting trips and learning to scuba dive and kayak in the Summit's Olympic-sized pools. Among the bigger, more extreme venues, there are 50 mountain bike trails. The 11 BMX tracks and jumps total the size of about five football fields. A paved skateboard park was built by the same team that designed venues for the Summer X Games, and it includes a bowl, a vertical ramp, street-style combinations and a foam pit for Scouts to try out new tricks. 'This is the exact opposite of 'no skateboards or roller blades allowed,''  Hartley said. Some of the venue designs fit in with the BSA's motto of building Scouts' confidence because they enable the youngsters to choose what fits their skill levels. Venues at Fort A.P. Hill addressed only the average skill set. 'Those are very different approaches to what we've done here that clearly is going to excite kids and provide opportunities that we've never had before,' McCarthy said. The planning includes incorporating safety procedures into staff training and venue oversight. Scout leaders want to be careful that exercise doesn't become exhaustion or worse. In 2005, four adult Scout leaders were killed in an electrical accident on the opening day of the Jamboree. In the four days of intense heat that followed, more than 300 Scouts and visitors fell ill. In 1997, a Scout was killed at the Jamboree after the Army Humvee he was driving overturned.","More than 3,000 Scouts aged 12 to 20 were required to meet a threshold .

An Ohio man who suffers from a terminal neurological disease has finally married his partner of more than 20 years after flying to Maryland and exchanging vows on the tarmac of the airport. In an emotional ceremony, John Arthur married Jim Obergefell from his stretcher last Thursday - just two weeks after the Supreme Court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act. 'I'm overjoyed,' Arthur told The Cincinnati Enquirer after the ceremony. 'I'm very . proud to be an American and be able to openly share my love for the . record. I feel like the luckiest guy in the world.' The couple, both 47, said they decided to marry after the momentous court decision - but they could still not exchange vows in Ohio because the marriage ban still exists at the state level. Just married: John Arthur (right), who suffers from ALS, grins alongside his partner of 20 years, Jim Obergefell, just moments after they married aboard a plane in Maryland earlier this month . When faced with where to go, their options were limited due to Arthur's amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - or ALS - a . progressive neurological disease that affects patients' speech and movement, and eventually their breathing. He is bedridden and had not left their home since March. They decided to marry in Maryland as only one . partner had to go for the license before both went for the wedding. Arthur knew he would be unable to make the journey twice. They chartered a small medical plane which cost $12,700 to rent with the help of generous donations from relatives and friends - and people they barely knew. Obergefell flew to Baltimore last Tuesday to obtain the marriage license and flew back just two days later with Arthur so their lengthy relationship could finally be legally recognized. Together: The couple, pictured with Arthur's aunt - who married them - decided to exchange vows after the Defense of Marriage Act was defeated by the Supreme Court but could still not do it in Ohio . John . Arthur suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as ALS or . Lou Gehrig's disease after the baseball player who had the illness. In . sufferers of the disease, nerve cells waste away or die, which leads to . muscle weakening, twitching and an inability to move limbs. The condition means it is impossible to carry out day-to-day tasks such as walking or swallowing. As . the condition worsens, the muscles in the chest area stop working and . it becomes hard for the sufferer to breathe on their own. The disease in incurable and 90 per cent of sufferers die within three to five years of their diagnosis. The condition affects around five in 100,000 people worldwide. After the 90-minute flight, they arrived in Baltimore with a nurse, two pilots and Arthur's aunt, Paulette Roberts, who had been ordained to marry the two men. Remaining inside the plane, they listined to Roberts speak as they gripped hands. 'Twenty-six months ago John was diagnosed with ALS,' she said. 'Since then the amazing relationship between John and Jim has become even closer, even more devoted, even more loving - and it was pretty damn great before John became ill.' After the seven-and-a-half minute ceremony was finished, they drank Champagne and headed back to Cincinnati, finally legally recognized as married - although they had felt they were for years. 'In our minds we've always been married, . but now I can actually say John's my husband and have a piece of paper, . and a Supreme Court ruling, and a federal government that says yes, he . is your husband,' Obergefell told the Enquirer. 'I'm overjoyed that we’ll now have a . piece of paper that confirms what we've always known in our hearts - . that we're an old, married couple who still love each other.' Strong: A sticker on the back of their van shows Arthur who is confined to a wheelchair due to his ALS . The . couple met twice through a friend in 1992 before meeting again at a New . Year's Eve party and experiencing 'love at third sight'. Within weeks, they had swapped rings and months later they moved in together. Just over two years ago, Arthur felt his . left leg dragging during a trip to Finland, and when he returned to the . U.S., he was promptly diagnosed with ALS. His . condition has worsened and is no longer able to walk. There is no cure for the illness, which eventually affects breathing and claims the sufferer's life within two to five years after diagnosis. With the onset of Arthur's illness, the couple felt the weight of not being able to marry; some employers did not allow them to share a health insurance policy, and they had to prepare powers of attorney, which they would not need had they been able to marry. Wedding venue: They stayed inside the plane and married on the tarmac at Signature Flight Support at Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport . They also sold their home and put their new one in Obergefell's name to avoid future problems. Although their exact rights have not yet been defined, when DOMA was defeated they knew it was time to get married - and devised their plan. 'Had the Supreme Court made this decision one year ago, this would've been as simple as us taking a trip because I could still walk,' Arthur said ahead of the marriage. 'It's the progression for me of the ALS, it's just compounded everything. I don't live in a world of regret but I sure wish we were a year in the past.' Next year, residents of Ohio will most likely be able to vote on whether to repeal the 2004 ban on gay marriage.","John Arthur and Jim Obergefell, both 47, married two weeks after DOMA was struck down by the Supreme Court .

"By . Amanda Platell . PUBLISHED: . 18:16 EST, 10 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:18 EST, 10 July 2013 . Controlling: Charles Saatchi is typical of the sort of man who has to have the last word . The last thing Nigella Lawson would have expected when she picked up the Sunday newspapers last weekend was to read that her husband of ten years was filing for divorce. Charles Saatchi chose to announce the end of their marriage in the coldest and most calculating of ways. Each word of his statement made me shiver in recognition. This was the valedictory missive of a controlling man prepared to sacrifice everything just to have the last word. It's only a month since Nigella suffered the very public humiliation of being photographed with her husband's hands around her throat. Everyone was shocked. How could such a strong, beautiful, hugely successful woman let herself be treated that way? When I read the Mail on Sunday headline 'Saatchi: I'm Divorcing You, Nigella', I was hit by a sense of sick dread. Why? Because I, too, have suffered the grave misfortune of falling in love with more than one such control freak in my lifetime. There is a misconception that controlling men seek out plain, meek women. But in my experience, that is not the case. There is, after all, no sport in leading a lamb to slaughter. No, the challenge for such men is to bring a  successful woman down from a great height. That's real power; complete domination. Such men are seductive creatures, shrewdly camouflaging their real character in the beginning, showering you with love so you feel you are the centre of their universe. But then the subtle changes start. There's the carping about the little things, the looks of disappointment, the casually cruel comments about the way you look or gentle criticism of your work, all of which chip away at your self-confidence. Take the behaviour of my ex, Mark, a journalist. I was with him for five years after we met in our late 20s and still wince when I remember how he could turn a compliment into a devastating blow. One evening, for example, after a long day at work, I hurriedly changed in the office loo into a beautiful dress I had bought specially for a party he was hosting. When I arrived, he was sitting on a bar stool surrounded by colleagues. He beckoned me over with a crook of his little finger. With all of them watching, he leant forward and kissed me on the forehead. 'Look at you, darling!' he said admiringly, then whispered: 'That dress does nothing to disguise your bottom, but I love you.' There you have the control freak's sinister double whammy: insult then compliment; knock you down then help you up. Trophy wife: Charles probably regarded Nigella as his prize exhibit - until he felt she was neglecting him for her career . I shudder to this day at the memory of it, and the way he started to begin every sentence with: 'The problem with you, Amanda, is…' A hundred things could ignite his ire: the way I'd cooked dinner, the fact I'd forgotten to pick up his dry-cleaning, or his belief that I didn't pay him enough attention when we went out together. Increasingly, his underlying theme was that he felt I was putting my work before him. I suspect Nigella, 53, found herself in the same situation. Those who know 70-year-old Saatchi say he is a control freak who could not stomach Nigella's success. He is infamous for the way he seeks to arrange everyone and everything around him as though they were exhibits in one of his minimalist art galleries. Nigella - for a while at least - was the prize exhibit. I had first-hand experience of his controlling ways when, in the 1980s, I was marketing director of a major newspaper group and his company, Saatchi & Saatchi, was our advertising agency. Always dressed immaculately in a black suit and white shirt, Saatchi was one of the coldest men I have ever met. He didn't suffer fools gladly, and to him, almost everyone was a fool. We can only speculate what had been going on in their marriage prior to that humiliating, brutish scene in the restaurant. My guess would be that, just like my own relationship with Mark, their problems began had begun many years before. At the beginning, Mark loved having a trophy girlfriend and relished the fact that people recognised me in the street. In the end, though, he perceived my work as a threat: it made me neglect him, he said. It was only by constantly putting me down that he felt he was able to control me and stop me doing the thing he most feared - leaving him. Which, of course, I eventually did. Happier days: The couple dining at Scott's restaurant, the same place where Charles would infamously grab Nigella's throat, precipitating their divorce . What's so ironic is that controllers end up hating the strong, successful woman to whom they were once so drawn. A friend of Nigella's has admitted: 'Charles never liked her being famous. He used to cringe if people came up when they were having a meal. It didn't suit his ego to be seen as Mr Nigella Lawson.' When I read that I almost wept, recalling my ex's reaction when he was sometimes introduced as 'Mr Platell'. It was as though he'd been castrated on the spot. After our separation, he told me: 'I just got sick of living in your shadow.' I wanted to scream back: 'Then try casting one of your own!' To my surprise and shame, I seldom fought back during the relationship. I never said: 'Forget my bum, look at the size of your gut.' I never mentioned the fact that he was stagnating in his career as he criticised the choices I made in mine. Not once did I berate him for not lifting a finger to help in the house, even though I paid the mortgage. My behaviour is, I think, typical of many so-called strong career women. Yes, we can make tough decisions in the workplace, but at home we just seek peace and companionship. We enter the fray each day at work, so it's the last thing we want at home. Nigella's friends say she became the 'ultimate pacifier', wary of her husband's moods and temper. Oh, how I can relate to that. When you're with a control freak, you feel you are walking on eggshells, always trying to second-guess him. Like many successful men, Saatchi was drawn to a remarkable and beautiful woman. Most men would love nothing more than to be married to one of the country's best cooks, yet Saatchi never forgot to mention that he didn't like her cooking and preferred cheese on toast. The controller turns every situation into a new opportunity to abase  their victim - as Saatchi did when confronted by photos taken at Scott's restaurant appearing to show him restraining his wife by pushing on the base of her nose. In fact, he insisted, he was cleaning her face as one might a child's. 'Even domestic goddesses sometimes have a bit of snot,' he said, humiliatingly. He never went to parties, so his wife often went alone, corseted in Vivienne Westwood and looking splendid but sadly alone. The message seemed to be that her silly superficial world was not engaging enough for him. Another ex of mine, a businessman I dated in my late 30s and almost married, used the same ploy. He refused to go out with me and my friends, dismissing them as 'boring' sycophants who were only interested in the fact that I was well-known. It was his way of trying to cut me off from those I was closest to. Thankfully, it didn't work. It takes time and experience to spot the tricks of the controller, and another of my exes eventually revealed himself as one such. The first time I got a big promotion and wanted him to celebrate with me and my workmates, he said he was so ill he had to go to hospital. I rushed home, as he knew I would, only to find him watching TV, saying he was feeling a little better. That pattern of mystery illnesses repeated itself again and again. But as well as playing games with my good nature, this man exploited my insecurities. Even when I was slim, he'd pat my tummy in a seemingly loving way and say: 'Could lose a few pounds there, couldn't we?' Hurtful: Saatchi never forgot to mention he didn't like Nigella's cooking and preferred cheese on toast . Most shockingly, after I'd had a major operation, lost 2st and was skeletal, he hugged me in front of my friends and said: 'Finally she's got her figure back.' When I finally left him, he told friends I'd gone mad and left the country. As with Saatchi, he was desperate to have the last word on the relationship. He even called my friends and said I'd become delusional and was in America with a new boyfriend. It was all untrue. One of my more savvy friends emailed him, copying me and my friends into it, saying: 'That's funny, I've just had lunch with Amanda in Chelsea.' Now I'm in my 50s. I have well-honed radar against such men and try to seek out those who are kind and considerate. I can only hope Nigella learns from her experiences in the same way. Any bruises on Nigella's throat will have healed by now, though I suspect those in her heart will linger. They will heal, however, and she should take comfort in the knowledge that she will never again have to hear those sinister words: 'The problem with you, Nigella, is …'","The way Charles Saatchi announced his divorce shows how calculating he is .

Giants for wrongful dismissal after his sacking over a picture of a teammate's bottom posted to his Twitter . Keith Mason is suing Huddersfield Giants for £300,000 after he was sacked over a tweet featuring a picture of a team-mate's backside. Mason, 31, has taken the Super League side to court following his dismissal last October for gross misconduct. The prop, who was one of the Giants' highest paid players, was sacked weeks after a picture of team-mate Scott Moore's behind was posted to his Twitter account, where it stayed for around 48 hours. The hearing, which started on Monday at Leeds High Court and is slated to last two days, heard the photograph was taken as Mason, of Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, was celebrating after the final game of last season. The court was told that after Mason returned home from the party on September 18 last year, his girlfriend came across the picture, which Mason claims was taken without his knowledge, while looking through his phone. She then uploaded the picture on to his Twitter account, to which he had around 4,200 followers, with the comment 'what the hell is this', the court heard. The court heard many of Mr Mason’s followers would have been Giants fans or rugby league fans in general and could have potentially seen the tweet. Mason went through the club’s disciplinary process and was dismissed for gross misconduct. The court was told the club thought the content of the tweet was contrary to their family values and Mason’s position as a role model. Martin Budworth, for Mason, said: 'He has a considerable number of followers and the club believe the image could have been viewed by a considerable number of people.' At the time of his dismissal Mason was one of the team’s highest paid players. After playing seven seasons for the West Yorkshire team he was sacked with nearly three years left on his contract. Mason, who has brought a case of wrongful dismissal against the club, does not believe all the facts of his sacking add up, his lawyer said. The court heard that just days after he left, the club had hired two new players to fill his position on a lower salary than his. Giving evidence, Mason, who has also played for Wakefield, Melbourne and St Helens and is currently in his second spell with the Castleford Tigers, described himself as 'respected' and a 'professional athlete' and agreed that as a player with the Giants he was 'immersed in holding up family values'. He told the court that ‘Mad Monday’, . when the photo was taken, was a time for the players to let their hair . down and that he was out from Sunday until Tuesday afternoon and had . consumed alcohol. Mr Mason arriving at Leeds High Court today: The prop, who was one of Huddersfield's highest-paid players, has brought a case of wrongful dismissal against the club, claiming all the facts of his sacking do not add up . When he . got back home he said he was 'rather worse for wear and with no sleep' and didn’t know his girlfriend had posted the picture. 'If I’d seen the tweet in the right frame of mind I would have taken it down straight away,' he told the court. 'I’ve never tweeted anything of this nature. 'There is no way ever I would leave a picture on my Twitter to offend anyone, especially someone’s backside.' Powerful: Mason had been a highly paid player . Mr Mason denied deliberately keeping the picture up until his agent told him to take it down. He said his agent never notified him about it and he took it down when he got over his hangover. He said: 'When I came round I took it off. I never thought at the time I would be getting a sacking two or three weeks later.' The hearing continues.","Keith Mason, 31, claims he was wrongfully dismissed by Huddersfield Giants .

Dr Chai Patel (pictured) says terminally ill and elderly people should be given the chance to decide where and how they die . Terminally ill and elderly people should be given the chance to decide where and how they die, a leading care home boss has said. Dr Chai Patel, who runs 230 UK care homes, says that while people are currently being given more and more choice about how they live their lives, they are still offered too little choice about how they die. He believes too many people currently die in ‘completely impersonal surroundings’. In his speech to the National Care Homes Congress today he will say that people should be given the opportunity to draw up a ‘living will’. This would allow them to specify exactly how, where, and when, they want to die. The Daily Telegraph reports that Dr Patel believes the introduction of ‘living wills’ could eventually lead to the establishment of euthanasia clinics in the UK. Dr Patel, who used to head up the Priory Clinics but is now head of HC-One, told the paper that too many elderly people are currently dying on hospital wards rather than in the comfort of their own homes because they are vulnerable to official processes. He said: ‘When you look at severe, chronic conditions like dementia, Parkinson’s disease, motor neurone disease, where the progressive nature of it is going to be so dreadful and everyone knows what the natural progression is, then why can’t we make a grown-up decision about how we want to go? ‘In the past 100 years we have found so many ways to live and we live well, but actually we die really badly.’ Dr Patel’s comments come at a time when the number of people in England over the age of 90 is predicted to increase by 146 per cent over the next 20 years. His views have been supported by the charity Sue Ryder which provides end of life care to terminally ill people. In a new report, the charity argues that people approaching the end of their lives should not have to face the ‘unacceptable trade-off’ of choosing whether to die at home without pain medication or in hospital where they can access the drugs. Dr Patel believes too many people currently die in 'completely impersonal surroundings' in hospital wards . More than three fifths of people polled by the charity and think tank Demos said they wanted to die at home and 78 per cent said pain relief was a top priority for them. But only 27 per cent of the 2,000 people across the UK who were questioned felt that home was a place where they could be pain-free during their final days. Paul Woodward, chief executive of Sue Ryder, said: ‘We are concerned that government and decision-makers are using “dying at home” as a proxy for quality. This is not good enough. Dying at home does not always guarantee a good death. ‘We need to start talking about how people want to die, not just where. Without a clear understanding of what people really want when it comes to care at the end of their lives, we can’t determine whether or not existing support meets their needs. ‘Everyone deserves a pain-free death, in the place of their choosing and to be surrounded by loved ones.’","Dr Chai Patel says elderly and terminally ill people are given too little say over circumstances of their death .

A respected New York City rabbi will appear in court this week accused of impersonating a police officer and pulling over drivers to berate them for going to slowly. Rabbi Alfredo Borodowski, 49, has been . arrested in one case and is being investigated in at least two more. Authorities say the apparent reason for trying to pull people over . was to rage at them for cutting him off or driving too slowly. The rabbi has been fired from a position . at prestigious Temple Emanu-El in Manhattan, one of the world's largest . Jewish houses of worship. He also leads a congregation in Larchmont. He was charged with impersonating a police officer June when he allegedly pulled alongside a woman's car in Mamaroneck, 20 miles north of Manhattan, and flashed a badge while shouting, 'Police. Police. Pull over.' Borodowski . allegedly told investigators: 'That girl was driving too slow and I . hate when people do this.' The woman did not pull over and called . police. Richard Clifford, representing the woman, said Borodowski 'just laid on the horn and started screaming at her' as she obeyed a 20-mph limit in a school zone. He added: 'She was so freaked out with . the horn honking and the screaming that she called police immediately. I . believe my client was in danger with this guy and if she had gotten out . of her car it could have escalated.' Borodowski denied to police he was trying to impersonate an officer, saying that he was telling the woman only that he would be 'calling the police.' He had a badge, which read Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority Officer 1338, which has been confiscated by police. The rabbi has been dismissed from a position at the Temple Emanu-El in Manhattan . Judie . Glave, a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, . which oversees the bridge and tunnel authority, said the badge is . 'totally fake.' Borodowski's lawyer, Andrew Rubin, acknowledged that the rabbi's behavior has been 'manic' and said he's suffering from bipolar disorder. The lawyer said the rabbi will plead not guilty in court this week. A previous hearing was postponed because the rabbi was hospitalized. After Borodowski was arrested a couple contacted police accusing him of trying to pull them over as well. Peter Moses said he was tailgated by Borodowski on a drive from Scarsdale to White Plains. He said Borodowski was 'obviously trying to make me go faster' than the 40mph limit but he said he slowed and the driver passed him and then blocked his path. Mr Moses said: 'He's shouting, ""I'm a . police officer, pull over"" and he's got this little badge that he's . waving at us. I told my wife, ""That's not a police officer."" Borodowski is still listed as rabbi on the website for Congregation Sulam Yaakov in Larchmont (pictured) 'Then he's out of his car and he's screaming, ""I can arrest you! I can have you arrested!"" He added: 'What we want is for the rabbi to get the emotional help he so obviously needs.' A third driver handed State Police a video of a confrontation in April on Interstate 87 near Yonkers. The . man, who has not been named, claimed that he swerved in front of a . driver who then flashed a badge and demanded that he pull over. 'He . was holding up this tiny badge, and I knew the guy could no way be a . cop in any sense of the word,' the driver told The Journal News. The three complaints prompted the trustees of Temple Emanu-El to dismiss Borodowski as executive director of the Skirball Center for Jewish Learning 'in the best interests of the Congregation,' said Mark Weisstuch, administrative vice president. Borodowski was still listed as rabbi on the website for Congregation Sulam Yaakov in Larchmont. A call to the synagogue there was answered by a man who said, 'No comment.

The trio, all from Long Island, coined being a 'betch' while they were at the Ivy League university, Cornell. They initially posted their 'five things betches love' (talking s***, not keeping up with the news, studying abroad, birthdays and diets)  on Facebook and as their popularity soared they developed the website that now has 3.7million page views a month. Samantha told The Times: 'We didn't intend it to be a business. It all just happened.' The site has been so successful in the U.S. - mostly with females aged 18-24 - that they have also published a 'self-help' book, called 'Nice Is Just A Place in France', and an online shop where fans can buy merchandise emblazoned with the betch mottoes including 'I want to lose three pounds'. They now operate from an office in Manhattan with ten staff writers, are in talks for a TV show, and plan to expand abroad, including to the UK, where a number of their betch idols reside including Pippa Middleton and Kate Moss. Success: The website gets 3.7million page views a month and has spawned a book and possible TV show . In their book, they make comments such as: 'Niceness is boring and overrated. Girls who think that being 'nice' is something to aspire to are most likely setting themselves up for a life of mediocrity, boredom, and cats.' They add: 'You should learn to be a girl who looks out for herself first and does not allow others to take advantage of her. Ideally, you should be doing the advantage-taking.' They state that a 'betch' should be 'edgy, speak her mind, and commands a room just by being in it.' And yet somewhat contradictorily, they state this should be done without trying to command any power in the world or by striving for any worthwhile achievements. This is perhaps epitomised by Aleen who studied pre-med at university but has now given up career plans to be a doctor to instead continuing expanding the betch business. 'It's a lot of shock value. We're trying to be funny but hopefully not too horrifying' Thus they now delve out the following career advice in their book: 'It’s important to realise that as a woman, you have the special privilege of not needing to work as hard as men do - in the general sense - unless you want to. 'The truth is that men pretty much gave up their right to demand we do anything, if you consider that for most of human existence, society ran pretty smoothly without our involvement. We don’t have to be the bread-winning gender if we don’t want to be, and we are f***ing happy about that. 'Don’t get us wrong, we’re definitely progressive and want our s***-talking voice to be heard. We’re just saying it’s perfectly okay to let men believe they are superior beings without whom civilization would crumble. Regardless of whether you agree, this ego boost is exactly what they need to do things for you (e.g., pay for dinner, overachieve on work projects, propose marriage).' In line with this, their role models and 'betch of the week' are women who have achieve fame with seemingly little talent such as the Kardashians. They state: 'Make fun of the Kardashians all you . want, but Kris Jenner has essentially manipulated the entire world into . becoming obsessed with her family’s every move. Armed with only a sex . tape and a marital bond to a tight-faced Olympian, the family used what . they had to become an American dynasty.' Get the book, get the T-shirt: Betch fans can buy merchandise featuring their mottoes such as 'I wanna lose three pounds' The betch phenomenon will shock and appall many - but if that's the case you've missed the joke according to the founders. 'Of course it's satire,' Jordana told The Times. 'The betch voice has become very easy to us. It's like an evil whisper in our heads. The alter egos we've made... it's extremely exaggerated and a bit ridiculous.' Aleen adds: 'It's a lot of shock value. We're trying to be funny but hopefully not too horrifying.' However, it seems the trio don't always succeed in this given many of their fans are impressionable young girls who don't get the satire. As a result the website has been criticised for encouraging eating disorders by championing being skinny, even if to them it's tongue in cheek. Samantha told The Times: 'None of us would ever want girls to hurt themselves. I feel bad that people out here might be taking it seriously, but we can't be responsible for everyone who reads our stuff It should be obvious that it is satire.' Victoria Beckham: 'Proof that image means everything' Victoria Beckham . 'Why? Because she was hot, skinny, . never seemed to give a s***, and her Spice Girls alias, Posh, didn’t suggest that . she was a monster, a toddler, or an Asian seasoning. 'The reason why Victoria Beckham . became an icon is proof enough that the image you make for yourself . means everything. 'Sure her cheat days consist of a fish egg and two . strawberries, but if that’s what it takes to be married to David Beckham . and produce a litter of Anne Geddes models while never gaining a pound, . so be it.' Pippa Middleton: 'The only thing anyone says about her is that she's hot' Pippa Middleton . 'When she's not being photographed walking down the street holding a new handbag every other day, she spends two days a week 'working' for her parents' party company and spends all the other days um, going to parties. 'She's even getting paid to (have someone else) write a book about parties. There's something to be said for a betch who literally writes the book on partying. 'But seriously, the girl could be a deaf and blind zombie and no one would know because the only thing anyone says about her is that she's hot.' Kate Moss: 'Almost fat' Kate Moss . 'Kate Moss has been accused of being anorexic since she was 14 years old and betch haters all over the world have been trying to say she promotes anorexia because they’re jealous of her. 'All these activists for eating seriously need to shut up. I mean, Wikipedia says she’s a size 2 and that’s almost fat.' Queen Elizabeth II: 'The Queen of doing nothing' The Queen . 'We usually aren’t huge fans of old people who wear pastel colored hats, but Elizabeth II is the best queen to come out of England since Elton John. 'We were born-again fans when she graced the Olympic opening ceremonies with her famous pout and new Bond Girl status. 'At the tea-scented age of 86, the only thing older than this betch of the week is her tiara. 'Elizabetch is literally the queen of not doing work. Born into a life of luxury, she makes the Kennedys look like the Hiltons.'","Jordana, Samantha and Aleen coined 'betchiness' while at university in U.S.

Engineers in Hong Kong have made a robotic spider that accurately replicates the creepy leg movements of real arachnids. The Robugtix T8 robot contains 26 little motors under its 3D printed case to make the spider move in a way that will certainly scare those terrified of the creatures. Scroll down for video... The Robugtix T8 robot contains 26 little motors under its 3D printed case - three in each leg and two in its abdomen - to make the spider move in a realistic way . Each of the robo-tarantula's legs houses . three motors, with two more used to animate the creature's abdomen, . allowing it to strike scary poses. The 3D printed spiderbot is powered by a microcontroller that runs a movement engine called Bigfoot Inverse Kinematics. The means that the master of the octopod does not have to send the robot intricate instructions. Using a wireless controller, an . individual can select a gait and tell the spider in which direction to . travel, making it ideal for stealth attacks and pranks. The engine handles all the complex mathematical theory and calculations required to control a multi-legged walking robot, leaving the operator free to focus on what it actually wants the spider to do. For example, a user can tell the spider to walk forward at a certain speed, while the engine takes care of detail such as inverse kinematics, leg trajectory planning and motor control. The company selling the robot says: 'This makes it quite easy even for absolute beginners to . play with advanced robotics.' The 3D printed spiderbot is powered by a microcontroller that runs a movement engine called Bigfoot Inverse Kinematics. It handles all the complex maths needed to control a multi-legged walking robot so the user only has to issue simple instructions . Unlike the T8 robot, real tarantulas (pictured) come in over 900 varieties and it is thought that they produce small quantities of silk from their feet, enabling them to cling to smooth surfaces . Owners of the scary toy may want to refrain from shocking a friend with arachnophobia and a good aim though, as the robotic mini beast costs over £900. The robot is the brainchild of a research, engineering and design company called Amoeba Robotics in Hong Kong, which specialises in making innovative robotics systems. It is on sale from the Robugtix website that creates bio-inspired multi-legged robots and is expected to ship in September. Luckily, for those who want more terror for their money there is a slightly less-realistic six-legged robot available for just over £160. The IITSII is a hexapod version of the T8 that contains 18 motors instead of 26, so there are still three in each leg. As there are no motors in the insect critter's body, it can't pose like it's spider peer, but still uses the same engine to move around in a realistic way. Both scary products come as kits and need to be built. The Controllers cost extra but there is scope for technophiles to create their own communication methods with the robots as they are open devices. Users of spider bot can choose between pre-programming their own sequences or directly controlling the robot in real time with . the wireless Robugtix Controller.","The Robugtix T8 robo-tarantula has 26 motors under a 3D-printed shell to move in a super realistic way .

Once Sloanes wore Alice bands, pearls and spent the weekends traipsing around the family estate, faithful spaniel in tow. Not anymore. The Sloane Ranger has evolved into the Sloane Raver: posh, pretty and with plans to party hard - wherever in the world they might be. Led by the Delevingne sisters, Poppy and Cara, London's coolest new style tribe have upstaged Dalson's hipsters; swapping the girls in pearls stereotype for neon shorts and bovver boots, and their spaniels for Harry Styles. So who are the Sloane Ravers? Femail makes the introductions. Sister act: Models Poppy and Cara Delevingne are leading lights of the hard-partying Sloane Raver set .

Never far from the headlines thanks to her penchant for One Direction boybanders and an outlandish approach to fashion, model Cara is the leader of the Sloane Raver pack. Described as 'the new Kate [Moss]' by Mario Testino, 22-year-old Cara has a background that's pure Sloane and is the daughter of former debs' delight, property developer Charles Delevingne, and his wife Pandora - a close friend of the Duchess of York. Regularly seen falling out of nightclubs with her 'wifey', singer Rita Ora, in tow, she's no stranger to controversy - most recently when a suspicious looking packet of white powder fell out of her pocket in front of the paparazzi - although that hasn't stopped her from becoming a designer darling.

'I always liked clothes but I never really understood them - but then I spent so much time with Daphne and Issy [Isabella Blow],' she revealed in an interview with Vogue. 'She took me to Monaco for a Fashion Rocks event once and just walked up to Donatella Versace and ordered her to dress me.

The family of a woman found hanging, bound and naked, from the balcony in her boyfriend's California mansion have filled a $10million wrongful death suit claiming that she was murdered. Authorities ruled Rebecca Zahau's death July 13, 2011 a suicide. It was the second bizarre tragedy in days at the multimillion-dollar Spreckels Mansion in Conrado, California, which belonged to Zahau's boyfriend, Jonah Shacknai - the CEO of a pharmaceutical company. Just two days earlier, Shacknai's six-year-old son Max fell off a staircase in the home and was mortally inured. He died says later in the hospital. Zahau was the only adult home at the time. Controversy: Rebecca Zahau, 32, was found bound, naked and hanging from the balcony of her boyfriend's multimillion-dollar mansion in July 2011 . Police say Rebecca Zahau, seen here with boyfriend Jonah Shacknai, 54, killed herself because she was distraught over the mortal injury Shacknai's son received when he fell while she was home . Now, Zahau's sister and her mother are alleging in a lawsuit that Zahau did not kill herself - but was murdered. They are implicating Shacknai's brother, Shacknai's ex-wife and her twin sister in the death of the death, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune. The lawsuit presents little evidence to support the claims that Adam Shacknai, Dina Shacknai, and Nina Romano are responsible for Zahau's death. The court filing doesn't provide any specific evidence against the three, but alleges 'defendants planned and prepared to batter and murder Rebecca and did thereafter brutally, and with malice aforethought, stalk, attack, choke, bound and hang her.' Jonah Shacknai, the billionaire founder of Arizona-based Medicis Pharmaceutical, is not named in the lawsuit. Shacknai and Zahau had been dating since 2008. Max Shacknai, 6, was mortally injured in a fall while Zahau was home two days before she 'killed herself' An extensive investigation by the San . Diego County Sheriff's Office found no criminal wrongdoing in either . death and no charges were ever filed. The Union-Tribune could not reach the Jonah, Adam or Dina Shacknai or Nina Romano for comment. Authorities said Zahau killed herself because she was distraught over a fatal fall that Shacknai's 6-year-old son suffered at the house two days earlier. His death was ruled accidental. Adam Shacknai was staying in a guesthouse at his brother's historic Spreckels mansion at the time of Zahau's death, the U-T reported. Dina Shacknai was staying in a separate vacation home a few blocks away, and Nina Romano had flown in from Sacramento to be with her sister. Adam Shacknai told police he found Zahau hanging by a rope from a second-story balcony at the mansion, and cut her down. Her hands were bound behind her back, her feet were bound and a T-shirt was wrapped around her lower face. The remodeled mansion was sold last month for $9 million to the owner of a private aircraft company in Utah. This is the balcony where Zahau was found hanging dead - bound and naked .

According to a patent it has been granted, the 'Digital Dash' system would be fitted with laser pointers that track the driver's eye movements as well as cameras that track head movements, and voice controls. It also has 'textured' onscreen buttons - created by notches and grooves in a screen overlay - that have been designed to feel like real knobs and switches and can be used to control car temperature and wipers, for example. Apple's Digital Dash patent is an extension of its iOS in the Car feature of iOS 7, pictured. The feature was announced last month and is due to be released in 2014. It connects wirelessly to iPhones and can be used to take calls on a hands-free kit, for example . This image, taken from an Apple patent, is an early design for a 'Digital Dash' - a car dashboard fitted with a touchscreen. The patent has been granted by the U.S Patent and Trademark Office and the system is an extension of the iOS in the Car plans announced with Apple's iOS 7 . Talking satnavs and taking your eyes . off the road to peer at a small screen could soon be a thing of the past after engineers have developed a portable device that beams directions . onto the inside of a car windscreen. Satellite navigation expert Garmin . has created a portable heads-up display (HUD) that sits on a car's . dashboard and projects turn-by-turn directions on a transparent film . attached to the windscreen. The . directions are sent to the HUD over Bluetooth from a smartphone running . the Garmin StreetPilot or NAVIGON satellite navigation apps. The Garmin HUD will go on sale in September and cost £139. These plans are in addition to the iOS in the Car system announced as part of iOS 7, which is set to launch next year. The plans filed to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office credit Canadian Tim Pryor as the inventor of the dash system. It contains a mix of original designs dating back to 1971 and more modern plans. The patent is called 'Programmable tactile touch screen displays and man-machine interfaces for improved vehicle instrumentation and telematics', or 'Digital Dash' for short. According to the plans, the dashboard would have a heads-up display (HUD) fitted into the driver's armrest to display maps, directions and so on. A touchscreen on the dashboard would respond to . laser pointers that can track the driver's eyes and switch layouts and screens accordingly, based on where the driver is looking. It would also have cameras that . detect a driver's head position so that onscreen information can be moved within the line of sight, for example. Many of the other examples used in the . patent involve images being projected onto the touchscreen, and because . these images could be customised and changed, depending on what tools . and features the driver wanted, the whole system could be programmable. Under Apple's 'Digital Dash' plans, an in-car system is fitted with laser pointers that track the driver's eye movements, cameras that track which direction their head is facing, as as well as voice controls. A heads-up display could be built into the driver's armrest, too . The touchscreen itself is shown as having 'raised ridges, indents or other tactile . properties to facilitate operation without diverting attention away from . the road.'

The new breed, called Autumn Amber, is the same shape and  size as the red raspberry and tastes the same, although some growers have said they are slightly more tangy. And while normal raspberry plants bear fruit only once every two years, the Autumn Amber variety has fruit every year.

The fruit is exactly the same size and shape as its red cousin and even tastes the same, but is an unusually eye-catching shade . The new fruit has been dubbed 'Autumn Amber' because of its warm hue . ‘Normally raspberry plants only grow fruit on them once every two years but the Autumn Amber will have fruit every year. ‘The plants grow to a maximum height of 6.5ft tall and they can be harvested every autumn after planting in the spring. ‘This is the first time people can grow the orange variety in their garden and they can be grown in the ground or in a large container on the patio. ‘They taste very similar to the normal ones you would find in the supermarket but I would say they have more of a tang to them. ‘We suggest putting them in a fruit salad with red raspberries for a good contrast.’ Horticulturalists at a plant research centre in Kent have spent the last 10 years breeding the Autumn Amber raspberry by using natural cross pollination techniques .

QUESTION: I'm wildly in love with my new partner, but he's so boring in bed - he'll only try one position and turn the light off. I've suggested we experiment, but he says men of his age (he is in his late-50s) are creatures of habit. I want to reply that my ex-husband and I (also 50-somethings) were always adventurous, but am scared he might leave me. What should I do? Rowan Pelling says: 'Many women can accept a less exotic sex life in their 50s, in exchange for finding a companion they truly love and trust' ANSWER: Golden rule number one: it is never a good idea to talk to your current love about the fabulous sex you had with an ex. This is particularly true if the five-star bedroom artiste is your former spouse. Many people end up loving a person who doesn't top their personal 'best in bed' poll, but how can it benefit anyone involved to share that knowledge? What you need to challenge is the 'creatures of habit' statement. What your partner means is that he is a creature of habit and frightened of change. Can you track down an area of his life in which he has had to modernise? Does he tweet, or use Facebook, or watch 3D films? All these mediums have only been in widespread use for a decade. Most of us acknowledge our lives can be enhanced by embracing change. If he's not a new media convert, can . you find a place he's visited, or activity he's embraced (dancing, golf, . gardening, crosswords?), that was not previously on his menu? The trick is to persuade your partner that he is not nearly such a stick-in-the-mud as he thinks he is. If you win the verbal argument outside the bedroom, it's more than likely you can win some manoeuvrability inside it. Why not make a pact that you can take charge for one night - and if he doesn't like it, he's back in the driving seat. Make it clear that if a new caress or . position increases his pleasure, you'll continue down that path; but if . it doesn't, then you will desist. Do bear in mind that the whole notion of change almost certainly scares your man, so you have to make adjustments that are gradual, simple and soothing. Don't suggest anything too unusual: your aim is to demystify the concept of sexual adventure. Of course, your partner may be one of those stubborn old-school types, who refuses to budge from his comfort zone. If this is the case, you will have to make some tough decisions. How key is exciting sex to your existence? Many women can accept a less exotic sex life in their 50s, in exchange for finding a companion they truly love and trust. And remember that many women would give their right arm to find a man who desires them and wants to have sex, no matter how repetitive the act. The main thing is that you are in love with him. I presume he's kind, attractive and interesting. Aren't these better qualities than the ability to perform the Kama Sutra's entire repertoire? If your answer to this question is no, then your partner clearly isn't right for you. But before you do anything rash, reflect on the words of one 52-year-old divorcee: 'I can find hundreds of men who want to have wild sex on dating sites, but finding a soulmate who will kiss me tenderly when I'm 80 is like hunting for a unicorn.'","Is it ever a good idea to talk about sex you had with an ex?

Wine may not be the first thing that springs to mind when you think of Luton, but the Bedfordshire town could soon find itself at the heart of Britain's answer to the Loire Valley. Known more for its airport and once being voted Britain's worst place to live, the surrounding area could be the ideal spot to set up one of Europe's largest wine growing areas. Thanks to hotter temperatures, grape harvests are set to boom with projected production already estimated to triple over the next 12 years. And an area stretching from Slough to just north of Luton has been pinpointed by scientists as one of the best and biggest areas for new vineyards. Cheers: Scientists have pinpointed several areas in the south of England which could be prime spots for wine production . Another glass sir: Luton could become the heart of the UK's answer to the Loire Valley thanks to a surge in average temperatures . New rival? The UK's burgeoning wine industry could soon rival that of the fine wines produced in the Loire Valley in France . A study that combined satellite . technology, soil analysis, climate and topography has found that large . parts of the south of England, in the Chilterns and Sussex and in north . Kent from Gravesend to Canterbury are now prime hotspots for potential . new vineyards. The burgeoning English wine industry has . been boosted by warmer temperatures which have provided better grape . growing conditions and seen a surge in alcohol levels in wines produced . here. The increasingly warm climate has seen the 'potential alcohol' of English grapes, which is an indicator of the strength of wine they could make, has shot up from between five and seven per cent to between 12 and 14 per cent. The alcohol potential of grapes is linked to their sugar content - which is all down to how much sun and warmth they are exposed to during cultivation. Met Office records show that average daytime temperatures in July shot up from 21.19C between 1961 and 1990 to 22.01C in the period between 1981 and 2010. On the up: Wine production is expected to rise from its current 2.5million bottles a year to 8million a year by 2025 . Overnight temperatures also rose from 11.56C to 12.24C. Warmer overnight temperatures mean that leaves heat up quicker in the morning and produce sugars for longer during the day. Similar temperature rises occurred in every other month of the year. London-based wine researcher Stephen Skelton told the Sunday Times that when he started out in the industry, English vineyards were growing varieties made to make wines such as Liebfraumilch, German-style wines that are not very popular among drinkers in the UK. But since the 1990s, it has been possible to grow Pinot, chardonnay and meunier grapes - which produce more popular wines. English winemaking has been rapidly expanding since 1989 when vineyards covered just 1,300 acres of the countryside. That figure had increased almost threefold to 3,700 acres by this summer. Around 2.5million bottles of English wine are currently produced every year, but that figure could double in the next two years and could hit 8million by 2025 with the biggest market in sparkling wines. Mike Roberts, co-founder of the Ridgeview Wine Estate in East Sussex told the Sunday Times: 'A key measure is the number of days you get where the temperatures rise above 29C. 'We have seen some bad years, but there is a clear trend. If it continues then there is a bright future for English wine.' Giant vineyards are now popping up in the English countryside - a prime example being the opening of the 300 acre Rathfinny Estate in Sussex. But the weather is not guaranteed. Nyetimber, England's largest vineyard, decided not to harvest its crop last year after bad weather conditions left the quality so poor.

It is known as the food of love – and now it has emerged that music may boost the odds of IVF success. Playing music to an egg in a dish in an IVF lab increased the chances of it being fertilised by 5 per cent, a study found. The Spanish researchers believe that the tiny vibrations produced by music give fertilisation a helping hand. Helping hand: It is known as the food of love - and now it has emerged that music may boost the odds of IVF success . They think the vibrations may ease the passage of nutrients into the egg and speed the removal of toxic waste, so increasing the odds of fertilisation taking place and the embryo surviving. While fully-grown humans may be fussy about the type of music they listen to, embryos aren’t so picky. Pop, classical and heavy metal were equally good, the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology’s annual conference in London heard. The scientists, from the Marques Institute fertility clinic in Barcelona, injected sperm into almost 1,000 eggs and put them on dishes in incubators. They then placed iPods in half the incubators and left them playing music including pop songs by Michael Jackson and Madonna, heavier tracks from Nirvana and Metallica and classical works by Bach, Mozart and Vivaldi. Star: Scientists placed iPods in incubators and left them playing music including pop songs by Michael Jackson and Madonna, pictured . When they checked the dishes, they found that fertilisation rates were higher in the incubators in which music had been played. Researcher Carolina Castello said: ‘When we work in an IVF lab, we try to mimic the conditions in the womb in terms of light and temperature. ‘For instance, we work in low light but nobody has studied the effect of sound.’ Embryos don’t develop the ability to hear for at least 14 weeks, so Dr Castello thinks that the vibrations produced by the music are key. Dagan Wells, an Oxford University fertility expert said that while the idea might sound bizarre, it could have some scientific basis. He said: ‘Embryos produced using IVF sit on a dish, stewing in their own juices but those produced naturally are wafted down the fallopian tubes, rocking and rolling all their way to the uterus. ‘This movement means that the embryo experiences a very dynamic environment, which may have some advantages, particularly in terms of getting rid of waste products. ‘The vibrations caused by music may stimulate this effect. ‘One might speculate that techno music, with its pounding bass beat might do the best job of all.’","Playing music to an egg increased chances of fertilisation by 5 per cent .

An energy saving scheme championed by the Government could be causing homes to overheat.Ministers are encouraging homeowners to improve insulation and install other environmental measures under their flagship Green Deal. But experts warn that while insulation may save energy in the winter, it could trap in excessive heat during the summer months if badly installed. It poses a particular health risk for the elderly, who could ‘die from overheating’. A report by a climate research group warned ‘Green Deal measures could create new problems in the future, with inappropriately-insulated properties experiencing poor indoor air quality and significant summer overheating’. The government's Green Deal initiative is designed to encourage home owners to install green technologies in their homes to help the environment and cut energy bills. However, these same energy-efficiency measures can pose a health risk in hot weather . The Government said it was aware of the risk and guidance is already in place to prevent inappropriate installations. Studies suggest there may be . typically around 2,000 deaths due to heat each year, compared to around . 25,000 as a result of the cold. But according to research group . Adaptation and Resilience in a Changing Climate, ‘if action is not . taken’ on the issue, heat-related deaths could more than double from . 2,000 to 5,000 by 2080. The Green Deal, launched by Chris .

In a study with Prof Li Shao, of the .

Facebook has begun rolling out its Graph Search to English-speaking users, enabling them to find out specific details about their friends.

For . example, users can search for friends in London who are vegetarians, . friends of friends who like yoga, or photos of a boyfriend from . a certain month or year. Scroll down for videos . Facebook has begun rolling out its Graph Search, pictured, which lets users find specific information about their friends using filters. Users can search for people who like cycling and are from London, for example, friends of friends who like yoga, or photos of friends or boyfriends from a certain month or year . One of the Facebook search result pages, showing friends who have interests in common. This search in particular looked for friends 'who like the things I like'. The data it used for this search was based on pages and activities that friends had 'Liked' on Facebook . The tool was launched in January to a select number of beta users and engineers. After months of refining and tweaking, it is now being launched to every Facebook user whose language is set to U.S. English. Unlike searches on Google, which are good for finding specific things like roasted kale recipes or Mizuno running shoes, Facebook's tool is most useful in unearthing information about your social circles. It can help users discover new music or films, or get restaurant recommendations from friends who have been there. Facebook claims that Graph Search is a better way to find out which of your friends have common interests. The first version of Graph Search focuses on four main areas -- people, photos, places, and interests. Facebook gives the following examples for searches:People: 'friends who live in my city,' 'people from my hometown who like . hiking,' 'friends of friends who have been to Yosemite National Park,' 'software engineers who live in San Francisco and like skiing,' 'people . who like things I like,' 'people who like tennis and live nearby' Photos: 'photos I like,' 'photos of my family,' 'photos of my friends before . 1999,' 'photos of my friends taken in New York,' 'photos of the Eiffel . Tower' Facebook's new search bar . Places: 'restaurants in San Francisco,' 'cities visited by my family,' 'Indian . restaurants liked by my friends from India,' 'tourist attractions in . Italy visited by my friends,' 'restaurants in New York liked by chefs,' 'countries my friends have visited' Interests: 'music my friends like,' 'movies liked by people who like movies I . like,' 'languages my friends speak,' 'strategy games played by friends . of my friends,' 'movies liked by people who are film directors,' 'books . read by CEOs' The tool uses ‘intelligent’ interpretation to . allow you to find friends by interest, for example Facebook suggests . typing in text such as 'Friends who like Star Wars and Harry Potter' when planning a film night. Yet it could also be used in the future by advertisers and marketers to learn more about you and target users with more personalised adverts. In recent months Facebook has been encouraging people to enter more information about themselves on their profiles, including work and education history, family information and so on. Graph Search uses any of this information about you that you have shared publicly - plus any pages that you've liked - including relationship statuses, addresses, phone numbers and check-ins. This includes data shared with friends and friends of friends. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Graph Search at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park in January. He said at the time the tool was not a web search and is not an attempt to take on Google. He added that only publicly shared information and information shared with friends is scanned and used for the results . However, any information that is set as private, or has been shared with only a select group of people, will not be used to populate the graphs. Speaking at the launch in January, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg said it is 'not web search’ - but the firm has partnered with Microsoft's Bing search engine in a snub to Google, which has its own social network, Google+. Graph Search will appear as a bigger search bar at the top of each page. When you search for something, that . search not only determines the set of results you get, but also serves . as a title for the page. You can edit the title – and in doing . so create your own custom view of the content you and your friends have . shared on Facebook. Graph search uses the same privacy settings as a user's normal profile - nothing needs to be changed. Soon after Facebook launched the tool a number of joke blogs were set up looking at the less innocuous and more embarrassing queries. For example, with Graph Search you can find out which brand of condoms your friends prefer. A blog called actualfacebookgraphsearches.tumblr.com posted a collection of searches ranging from 'married people who like prostitutes' to 'current employers of people who like racism.' Both yielded more than 100 results. The blog was created to highlight how much personal information people share online. Facebook plans to notify users that it's 'getting easier for people to find photos and other things you've shared with them' along with a reminder that they can check 'who can see my stuff' under their privacy settings. 'The goal is to avoid bad surprises,' said Nicky Jackson Colaco, privacy and safety manager at Facebook. As well as information about a friend's location, likes and favourite films, Graph Search can be used to find photos from a particular time. This makes it easier for users to discover embarrassing baby photos, or photos from university, for example. This image shows photos of friends from before 1999 . But she stressed Facebook's view that the search tool 'indexes information differently than we have ever been able to do before, in a really positive way.' It's easier, for example, to find a long-lost classmate with a common name, or to find common interests with friends of friends. Facebook does not currently show users ads based on what they are searching for but the company may do in the future. Research firm eMarketer estimates that Google will take nearly 42 percent of all U.S. digital ad spending this year, well above Facebook's share of less than 7 percent. With its new search tool, Facebook is clearly trying to divert traffic and ad spending from its rival. Whether this will work will become more clear as more people begin using it.","Graph Search lets users find specific information about their friends - and which ones have common interests - using various filters .

Designers in Seattle have invented the Sense+ docking station, pictured, that doubles up as a smoke and gas alarm. When the built-in sensors detect smoke or carbon monoxide, an app on the docked phone will open and an alarm will ring. The Sense+ can then automatically call a list of customisable emergency numbers . The Sense+ docking station has a built-in photoelectric sensor. This sensor, also known as a photo eye is used to detect the distance, absence, or presence of an object by using a light transmitter, often infrared, and a photoelectric receiver. The Sense+'s photoelectric alarm aims a light source into a sensing chamber at an angle away from the sensor. Smoke enters the chamber, reflecting light onto the light sensor and this triggers the alarm. If this alarm is not manually turned off within 30 seconds, a list of emergency phone numbers is displayed on the iPhone's screen before the system begins automatically calling these numbers for help. The user can also shut down the app or decline from making emergency calls. These emergency numbers can be customised and the app will only call the . numbers added to the Home Group - it can't access the user's phone . book. The Sense+ uses a 'photoelectric' sensor that can detect cold smoke which some traditional smoke alarms have difficulty sensing. This is combined with a carbon monoxide sensor. The designers claim that in certain situations the Sense+ could be more effective at alerting the user to a fire or dangerous gases than wall and ceiling-mounted sensors. However, instead of replacing them, the inventors designed the Sense+ to work with the existing alarms to increase protection. The majority of ceiling-mounted smoke detectors rely on ionisation smoke detection and respond more effectively to smoke caused by flaming fires.

When smoke enters the chamber it reflects light onto the light sensor and this triggers the alarm. The Sense+ device is designed by company Studio Tonic based in Seattle and costs £65. The design team developed the Sense+ after looking at deaths caused by smoke inhalation in houses in developing countries. They discovered that many of these households did not have smoke alarms yet they did have the latest smartphones. This led them to create the Sense+ as a flexible personal alarm . that works as a backup detector and a device that helps quickly when . needed. The current version has been designed specifically for the iPhone 5 yet it also supports the connection of other smart devices through a USB port. The makers also have future versions planned for Android and Windows smartphones. Will Grant, spokesman for Sense+, said: 'Sense+ is an emergency aid solution consisting of an app and a charging dock. 'It uses the latest smoke and carbon monoxide detectors to detect cold smoke and automatically take action for you in case of an alarm. The current version of Sense+ has been designed specifically for the iPhone 5 yet it also supports the connection of other smart devices through a USB port. It was designed by Studio Tonic in Seattle and the makers have future versions planned for Android and Windows smartphones . 'The thinking behind it was to potentially save lives. 'It uses photoelectric technology smoke sensors because it is best for detecting smoke which is the major killer in house fires. 'It also uses carbon monoxide detectors. As invisible, odorless and tasteless, carbon monoxide is a very poisonous gas that can kill quickly and without warning. 'The combination of the two detectors is very powerful especially in situations like caravanning, boating, camping, and travelling. 'We tested the Sense+ against a group of off-the-shelf ceiling type sensors and with the smoke testing the Sense+ always outperformed the photo voltaic models. 'But when the Sense+ was at bedside height, the off-the-shelf models at ceiling height went off quicker.'","Sense+ detector is an iPhone docking station with a built-in smoke sensor .

Former England and Chelsea footballer star Ray Wilkins unleashed a foul-mouthed tirade when he was found to be three times over the legal drink-driving limit, a court heard today. Mr Wilkins, 56, allegedly slurred his words and was unable to stand up when he was pulled over by police as he drove home in May last year. The Sky Sports commentator is said to have called police procedures a  'f****** joke' when he was told he could not call his wife until he had given breath samples. CCTV footage played to the court showed the pundit apparently struggling to complete the tests. Mr Wilkins is heard to say: 'F****** hell, I can’t even phone my missus. This is a f****** joke. I’m not going to bash up anybody... this is ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous.' The 56-year-old was arrested in the early hours of the morning near his home in Cobham, Surrey after an officer spotted his car 'weaving' down the road moments after it allegedly 'lurched' forward and hit a traffic island. North Surrey Magistrates’ Court heard that Mr Wilkins was forced to lean on his Jaguar car for support when he was asking to get out of his car. PC Nicholas Skidmore told the court today: 'There was a strong smell of intoxicating liquor in the vehicle and around him. 'When he got out of the vehicle, he couldn’t stand up properly. 'He had to lean against the car.' The officer - who claimed he did not recognise Mr Wilkins when he arrested him - said the former footballer fell asleep in his unmarked police car. The officer was heard questioning Ray Wilkins about his broadcasting job while he was in custody. In CCTV footage shown to the court, he was heard to say: 'I'm not really into football myself ... are you into it in a big way?' Wilkins answered: 'I have been for many years, yeah.' Paul Lund, prosecuting, said Wilkins would challenge the reliability of the result of his breath test. 'Mr Wilkins says that he can't have drunk enough to produce that high reading,' he told the court. 'That, in the crown's submission, is an assertion without merit. 'At the end of the day, the defence is relying on Mr Wilkins' assertion that he hadn't drunk enough ... he would say that, wouldn't he?' Mr Wilkins, who notched up 84 caps for England during his playing days, was more than three times over the legal drink-driving limit. Heyday: Ray Wilkins played for Chelsea and England during his career as a midfielder.  He denies drink-driving charges . Tests revealed he had 104 and 102 . microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath - almost three . times the legal limit of 35 microgrammes. A roadside reading recorded 109 microgrammes in 100 millilitres of alcohol. Wilkins stared straight ahead as the CCTV footage was played to the court. Pc . Skidmore said he was unable to recall everything Wilkins said while in . custody but added: '(He said) he knew that he had done wrong and he . wanted to speak to his wife as soon as possible.' During his career, the former footballer played at various clubs including Chelsea, Manchester United, AC Milan and Queens Park Rangers and was awarded an MBE in 1993 for services to football. He is standing trial at North Surrey Magistrates’ Court in Staines-upon-Thames, where he denies drink-driving. The three-day case continues.

The final member of a 16-strong mob convicted of killing a 15-year-old schoolboy in an attack planned on Facebook was jailed for 11 years today. Junior Bayode was 16 when he helped hunt down Sofyen Belamouadden, who was stabbed to death in front of hundreds of horrified rush hour commuters at Victoria Station in London. Witnesses said the teenage victim was chased into the Tube station ticket hall in a scene likened to an 'infantry charge' and attacked with a terrifying arsenal of weapons including knives and a samurai sword. Bayode, now 19, was one of those armed with a blade and was caught on CCTV surrounding the victim on the floor as he was hacked to death. Jailed: Junior Bayode is the final defendant to be convicted in relation to the killing of 15-year-old Sofyen Belamouadden at Victoria Station in 2010, and was sent to prison for 11 years today . Violent: Mr Belamouadden died after suffering fatal wounds to his heart and right lung inflicted by weapons including this Samurai Sword recovered by police . Mr Belamouadden died after suffering fatal wounds to his heart and right lung on March 25, 2010. Bayode was convicted of manslaughter at the conclusion of a trial last October, but a jury were unable to agree on a more serious charge of murder. Judge Christopher Moss QC refused permission for a retrial and prosecutors lost an Appeal Court challenge. Today, more than three years and three months after the killing, Bayode was formally acquitted of murder after the Crown offered no evidence and jailed. Bayode was the twentieth suspect to go before the courts and the sixteenth to be convicted of his part in the killing. Judge . Moss said he reduced Bayode’s sentence from 12 years to 11 years for . manslaughter because he is suffering from lymphoma, although it is now . in remission. The judge . added: ‘I have no doubt you travelled to Victoria expecting a violent . confrontation which in fact took place and prepared to take part in it. ‘You . joined the group of killers, you set upon Sofyen as he lay helpless and . defenceless on the floor of the ticket hall. It is said that you were . yourself armed with a knife. ‘The . killing of Sofyen Belamouadden took place in dreadful circumstances in a . public place. You played your part in the death and you stand convicted . of his manslaughter.’ Savage: This knife was found on a bus shortly after the killing of 15-year-old Sofyen Belamouadden . A knife concealed in Metro newspaper found on the C10 bus after the murder of the budding footballer . Evidence: This metal rod or knife sharpener found near seats on a bus after the attack . One of the kitchen knives given to a witness on the C10 bus, shown in images released by police . Bayode was also sentenced to seven years for conspiracy to cause GBH. His conviction came at the conclusion . of a series of five trials spanning nearly two years and comprising the . biggest case the Crown Prosecution Service has ever dealt with. Fifteen others have already been jailed for a total of 129 years. The massacre had been planned the . night before using Facebook and - in a chilling foreshadow of the 2011 . London riots - the instant messaging feature on the killers’ BlackBerry . mobile phones. Det Ch . Insp John McFarlane from Scotland Yard's Homicide and Serious Crime . Command, said: ‘Had it not been for social media - for BlackBerry . messaging, Facebook and telephone usage - they wouldn’t have been able . to organise and get the weapons and numbers and the situation would have . been able to defuse. ‘A quarter of a mile from Buckingham Palace, . half a mile from Scotland Yard and at one of the busiest railway . stations in the country in front of hundreds and hundreds of . eyewitnesses they are brandishing weapons and carrying out extreme . violence. ‘The didn’t think about the consequences.’ Awful: Hundreds of commuters at Victoria Station (file picture) watched in disbelief as the teenager was killed as they caught their rush hour trains . Mr Belamouadden’s . murder was the result of ‘simmering tensions’ between pupils at St . Charles Sixth Form College in Ladbroke Grove, west London, and teenagers . from Henry Compton School in Fulham, where Sofyen was studying. His . attackers used a £3.99 five-piece knife set bought from Argos, as well . as batons, iron bars and a Samurai sword in an act of ‘indescribable . aggression’. This ferocious attack was captured on CCTV inside the station and showed the teenager being knocked to the floor and set upon. The . attacking group, many of whom wore a single glove on their left hand to . identify themselves, thought of the station as their territory. Facebook . was used to recruit troops and weapons, with one attacker asking online . friends for a ‘flick-up ting’ and asking an older friend to ‘buy some . nanks from Argos’, referring to a box set of kitchen knives. Others, . who communicated by BlackBerry Messenger and text message, talked about . the ‘madness’ that was going to unfold the next day. Victoria . Osoteku, who had then just turned 18, bought the weapons from a branch . of the chain store the following day, alongside pastor’s son Femi . Oderinwale, 19. Osoteku, . now 20, and Oderinwale, along with Adonis Akra and Samuel Roberts, both . 19, were each jailed for 12 years after they were convicted of . manslaughter in a series of five trials spanning nearly two years. The . police presence at the station had been stepped up following an . assault the previous day, but officers were unable to prevent the . ferocious violence that followed. Witnesses said the attacking group had . a ‘pack mentality, a collective sense of common purpose, as though they . were a team’ and used an ‘indescribable’ level of aggression. Sofyen . and his friends tried to flee, but he made a ‘fatal mistake’ and headed . into the Tube station ticket hall where he was surrounded and stabbed . at least nine times. Samson . Odegbune, now 19, was seen brandishing a ‘Japanese-style sword’ with a . blade up to a foot long during the chase, during which he told his . victim: ‘I’m going to f*** you up.’ He had bragged on Facebook the previous night: ‘I will bring my Samurai’. CCTV: Already jailed Samson Odegbune was seen brandishing a 'Japanese-style sword' with a blade up to a foot long during the chase, during which he told his victim: 'I'm going to f*** you up' He was on bail at the time of the killing after he was arrested as part of a gang who had been brandishing a similar sword on a bus - though he was never charged. Odegbune, along with Christopher Omoregie, also 19, and Obi Nwokeh, 20, were each sentenced to detention at Her Majesty’s pleasure - the juvenile equivalent of a life sentence - with a minimum term of 18 years after they were convicted of Sofyen’s murder. Odegbune’s minimum term was later reduced to 16 years by the Court of Appeal. Odegbune did not attack Sofyen but instead led others who chased the victim’s friends away from the station. Following the attack 12 of the 20 suspects boarded a bus and appeared ‘hyper’ and ‘pumped up’ to other passengers. One of them was overheard telling a friend: ‘Didn’t you see me run in to the station and shank him?’ Murderers (from left to right): Obi Nwokeh, 19, Christopher Omoregrie, . 18, and Samson Odegbune, 18, were all given a life sentence and told . they must serve a minimum of 18 years . Attack: Victoria Osoteku, left, was seen on CCTV . kicking Sofyen Belamouadden, right, in the head as he lay dying on the . ground . Police officers stopped the bus and found a selection of knives as well as blade-sharpening steels and a schoolbag. Other bloodied knives were found in a knife amnesty bin on Victoria Street. Before officers boarded, one of the youths passed a knife covered in a cardboard sheath to a young mum. She later took the weapon home, . cleaned it and disposed of it but police were able to recover it after . she reported the incident.

Chris Goncalves and Tayo Ajayi, now both 20, received two-and-a-half year jail terms after they were convicted of the same charge. But Ajayi walked free from court to begin studying for a degree in sports coaching, having served the equivalent of 464 days on remand. Amarl Wood, 18, was locked up for 27 months after he was found guilty of an identical charge. He had to serve just 11 days behind bars following his conviction and was allowed to work as a steward at the 2012 Olympics.

But @IDS_MP is not Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith but a parody Twitter account mocking the minister. Gaffe: David Cameron's official account linked to the spoof @IDS_MP account which mocks the government . Reaction: The spoof account was quick to respond to the Prime Minister's mistake . Blunder: Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan does not tweet, possibly heeding Mr Cameron's warnings about the perils of social media . In fact Mr Duncan Smith is not on Twitter at all, preferring to spread his political message on TV and radio, where he today accused the BBC of being 'politically-motivated' in its criticism of his reforms. The clues that the @IDS_MP account was not real were there. The account biography includes 'parodia' and the phrase 'chin chin old bean'. The most recent tweet reads: 'I've always supported a Mansion Tax. Your Tax buys my Mansion. Chin chin!' This morning the account reacted to the Prime Minister's gaffe: 'Chin chin Dave. Round mine for a Pimms later?' The Prime Minister was trying to highlight the new benefits cap which means that the maximum amount of benefits . a family can claim will be limited to £26,000 a year – a figure equal to . a pre-tax salary of more than £34,000. Parody: There were plenty of clues to the fact that the @IDS_MP account was not genuine . Jokes: The spoof account includes a stream of gags about the wealth of Tory Cabinet ministers and their attitude to the poor . Cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith . today accused the BBC of launching a ‘politically-motivated’ attack on . government plans to cap benefits. In . an extraordinary on-air blast, the Work and Pensions Secretary accused . the Corporation of using ‘lots of little cases’ to claim that limiting . welfare payments would not get people back to work. Mr Duncan Smith was grilled by BBC . presenter John Humphrys, after the Today programme aired an interview . with one benefits claimant who said she did not want to leave her home . in London to find work. The minister tore into the BBC’s attempts to undermine his . reforms: 'What you are doing as always happens in . the BBC is seeking out lots of little cases from people who are . politically motivated to say this is wrong.’ Under the benefits cap, couples and . lone parents will not receive more than £500 a week under the new cap, . with single people limited to £350 a week.

The family of Michael Boatwright - who was found unconscious in a Palm Springs motel room four months ago and woke up speaking only Swedish - have revealed themselves after learning of his whereabouts for the first time on Monday. Even though his driver's license says he . was born in Florida and served in the U.S. Navy from 1971 to 1973, . Boatwright has no memory of his life to date and now answers only to . Johan and converses in Swedish to doctors with the help of an . interpreter. Now Boatwright’s sister has revealed that she did not know whether he was alive or dead and that she hasn't seen him for 10 years. Scroll Down for Video . Amnesia: Michael Boatwright awoke to find he had no memory of his past life to date, could not recognize his own reflection and believed he was Swedish . 'I haven’t talked to him in years. He just disappeared,' Michelle Brewer  told The Desert Sun over the phone from her home in Louisiana. She said that she had no way to get in touch with the 61-year-old, even when their mother had died last year, she said. 'He’s always been just a wanderer. Then he’d come back when he needed some money or something from somebody. Then he’d take off again,' she said. Boatwright was overwhelmed by the flood of calls Monday, but wanted to thank those who were helping him piece together his story, hospital spokesman Rich Ramhoff said. Former life; Michael Boatwright served in the U.S. Navy from 1971 to 1973 (left) and was carrying old photographs on him when he was discovered in a Palm Springs motel room in February . His . current persona of Johan Elk, clashes with the Social Security card, . passport and veteran's medical card he was carrying in February and . following mental and physical health exams, Boatwright was diagnosed on . March 13th with transient global amnesia. Doctors . at Desert Regional Medical Center have theorized that his total memory . loss was triggered by some kind of emotional or physical trauma - what . exactly that was though, they admit to drawing a blank on. 'He's . kind of a blank slate,' said Lisa Hunt-Vasquez, the social worker . assigned to track down relatives and help piece his life back together. Searching . on the internet, Hunt-Vasquez has learned so far that Boatwright was a . 3D graphic designer who taught English in Japan for 10 years and then in . China for four. She has discovered on a testimonial on . the website of a TPR English School in Zhuhai, China, that he left his . teaching post one year before his catastrophic memory loss. Baffling: Michael Boatwright is pictured here with two women - one who is believed to be his wife and a little boy thought to be his son . However, every attempt to discover a friend or relative has failed. An address on his U.S. passport for a Japanese woman believed to be his ex-wife was a dead end - as was all the telephone numbers listed on his cellphone. Indeed, the Japanese, Chinese and Swedish consulates have turned up no next-of-kind information. What is known is that Boatwright flew into Palm Springs from Hong Kong on February 24th - which was the last day valid on his Chinese visa. Hunt-Vasquez said that she did not know why he had chosen to fly into California and even contacted local tennis clubs to see if he was scheduled to play - thinking his tennis rackets might be a clue. Upon contacting Dade County Missing Persons Bureau in Florida, she found that Boatwright's parents were deceased and that his first wife divorced him in 1983 - she could not be contacted. It was even thought at one point that Boatwright could have two sisters in Sweden, but again, that has not been confirmed. No Recollection: This is one of the photographs which have failed to jog the memory of Michael Boatwright from his amnesia . For Boatwright, the sheer frustration and confusion of the whole ordeal is maddening. 'When I look at the photos, I see my ex-wife and my son ... my mother and grandmother, but I don't recognize them. I don't know them,' he said. 'Sometimes it makes me really sad and sometimes it just makes me furious about the whole situation.' Indeed, to help Boatwright adjust to his new reality, Hunt-Vasquez has put him in contact with Palm Spring's local Swedish-American community at the Vasa Order of America's Desert Viking lodge in San Jacinto. His friend there, Viola Wyler, told MyDesert.com that despite lucid conversations, Boatwright suffers from detachment from reality. 'All of the events that he talked about, he has never been involved in it; he always feels that he is looking in,' Wyler said to MyDesert.com . Relief: Michael Boatwright uses exercise as the only way to concentrate his mind and not think about his memory loss . From their talks, Wyler surmises that he did indeed live in Sweden in the mid-1980s, but because he has no strong regional accent she thinks that he learned it late in life or has not used it much during his adult life. Even the photographs that he carries do not trigger his memory in any way. Despite the knowledge that he used to be a graphic designer and taught English as a second language, Boatwright has no memory of how to execute the skills he learned during his life. And sadly now, Hunt-Vasquez is worried that he may not be able to stay in the hospital much longer because, despite his amnesia, he is healthy. But, the hospital is also looking for other viable options - 'really try to avoid just him being in the streets.' For Boatwright, though, his daily life is a living hell. 'Walk in my shoes for one day,' he said. 'You'll experience the nightmare of a lifetime.'","Michael Boatwright awoke four months ago with no recollection of who he was and speaking in Swedish .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 22:37 EST, 16 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 23:33 EST, 16 July 2013 . A Texas man convicted of fatally shooting a retired sheriff's deputy during the robbery of an amusement center more than a decade ago was put to death Tuesday. John Manuel Quintanilla received lethal injection for gunning down 60-year-old Victor Billings at a game room in Victoria, about 125 miles southwest of Houston. The 2002 slaying came just a few months after Quintanilla had been released from prison after serving a sentence for several burglary convictions. Asked to make a final statement before his execution, Quintanilla told his wife he loved her. Death by lethal injection: In 2002 within months of his parole after multiple 10-year sentences for burglaries, John Manuel Quintanilla shot and killed a retired sheriff's deputy during a holdup of a South Texas amusement center . 'Thank you for all the years of happiness,' he said. He never acknowledged his victim's friends or relatives, including two daughters, who watched through a window. As the lethal drug began taking effect, he snored about a half dozen times, then stopped breathing. At 7:32 p.m. CDT - 15 minutes after being given the drug - he was pronounced dead. Quintanilla's wife, a German national who married him by proxy while he was in prison, watched through an adjacent window and sobbed. The Texas death chamber in Huntsville: Texas has executed nine people so far this year . Quintanilla, 36, became the ninth Texas inmate to receive lethal injection this year and the 501st since the state resumed carrying out capital punishment in 1982. His was the first of two executions set for this week; the other is planned for Thursday. Quintanilla's punishment was carried out after the U.S. Supreme Court refused two last-day appeals. His lawyers contended his confession was coerced by authorities threatening to also charge one of his sisters and that the statement improperly was allowed into evidence at his trial in 2004. The lawyers obtained affidavits from two jurors who said the confession was a key to their decision to convict him. 'It is clear that Quintanilla would not have been convicted of capital murder if his confession had not been admitted - a fact confirmed by two of his jurors,' appeals lawyer David Dow told the high court. The appeal also argued Quintanilla had deficient legal help during his trial and in earlier stages of his appeals, and that his case would give justices the opportunity to define filing rules in light of recent death penalty rulings from the court. The Texas attorney general's office said the appeal was without merit and improperly filed, and that the juror affidavits also were improper. 'There wasn't any coercion whatsoever,' Dexter Eaves, the former Victoria County district attorney who was lead prosecutor at the trial, recalled last week. He also said that while the robbers, who fled with about $2,000, were masked, witnesses were able to 'describe very clearly who the triggerman was.' Execution room: Texas has executed just over 500 inmates since the death penalty was reintroduced in 1976 . Court records show Billings, a retired chief deputy from nearby Edna in adjacent Jackson County, was at the game center with his wife on the Sunday before Thanksgiving in 2002 when the gunmen came in through a back door. Billings approached one of them and grabbed the barrel of the gunman's rifle 'so no one else was going to be hurt and paid for it dearly,' Eaves said. He said Billings was shot three times, the last one fired while he was on his knees. 'A very cold killing,' Eaves said. During questioning by detectives for an unrelated robbery some two months later, Quintanilla made references to the still unsolved Billings case, then led authorities to a canal where divers recovered items used in the holdup. 'They had the mask, the guns and his statements saying who did what,' Jim Beeler, Quintanilla's lead trial lawyer, said. 'He told them everything.' Beeler said the trial judge overruled his objections and ruled the statements proper and admissible into evidence. He also said Quintanilla signed affidavits ordering that his defense team present no mitigating evidence during the punishment phase of his trial, where jurors deciding his sentence could have considered he had virtually no parental supervision while growing up. 'You want to argue your case, completely and totally,' Beeler said. 'In that situation, we're not being allowed to present our case, based on our client. 'It's extremely frustrating.' Prosecutors bolstered their case for Quintanilla's future dangerousness by presenting evidence he attacked a jailer with a homemade weapon while awaiting trial. 'He did not do himself any favors,' Eaves said. Quintanilla's accomplice, Jeffrey Bibb, 33, is serving 60 years for murder and 50 years for aggravated robbery. On Thursday, another Texas inmate is set for lethal injection. Vaughn Ross, 41, is to be executed for a double slaying in Lubbock in 2001.","John Manuel Quintanilla Jr. was sentenced to death by lethal injection .

Today, she had to make do with a tour of a Devonshire fishing village as another day passed without an appearance from the new third-in-line to the throne. Despite the lack of a new Royal heir, the Duchess appeared to be in good spirits as she toured  the pretty town of Brixham, famous for its fish pie and picturesque harbour, with the Prince of Wales. During the tour, Prince Charles found time to present the King George V Cup to the crew aboard the Pilgrim, a restored fishing trawler and the winner of the town's annual working trawler race. Thanks sir! Prince Charles presents the crew of restored trawler, the Pilgrim, with the silver George V Cup . Welcome: The Prince and Duchess were given a round of applause as they left the boat . Excitement: The Royal couple appeared to be in good spirits as they toured the marina in Brixham . The race, which has been run almost every year since the early 1800s, was originally for the Perpetual Challenge Cup before the race came to the attention and approval of King George V, after whom the modern cup is named. After presenting the silver cup to the Pilgrim and its crew, the Prince and Duchess decamped to one of the Royal National Lifeboat Institute vessels moored in the harbour. The visit to Brixham was part of the . Duke and Duchess' annual three-day visit to the West Country, which yesterday saw . them in the Cornish ports of Bude and St. Austell. It was during a visit to a children's . hospice in Porthpean near St Austell, the Duchess of Cornwall hinted . that royal baby was on the way, telling well-wishers to expect a bundle . of joy by the ‘end of the week’. With a due date of yesterday confirmed by Clarence House, the couple will have been on tenterhooks as they walked through the town, with the baby expected at any moment. Should the child arrive during the couple's stay in the South-west, the drive back to London would take around five hours, although they have no plans to be present at the birth which is due to take place in the Lindo Wing at Paddington's St Mary's hospital. Yesterday's tour took in Bude Town Centre where Camilla, who already has five young grandchildren of her own, was particularly taken with some of the young fans they met.

Camilla gave an impromptu speech to assembled guests at the Porthpean hospice during which she said: ‘We are all just waiting by the . telephone. We are hopeful that by the end of the week he or she will be . here.’ While his father and stepmother are touring Devon and Cornwall, it is understood that the Duke of Cornwall has taken a few days off from his work as an RAF Search and Rescue pilot in North Wales. Following . two long-standing charity polo matches at the weekend, during which the . Duchess decided stay with her parents in Berkshire, he and his wife . will now remain at their Kensington Palace residence. The palace is just a few minutes’ drive from St Mary’s in Paddington where Kate is hoping to have a natural birth. The Duchy of Cornwall is one of England's two Royal Duchies, the other being the Duchy of Lancaster which is held in trust for the Queen. Despite the name, more than half of the 133,658-acre estate is in Devon, while the rest is split between Cornwall, Herefordshire, Somerset and Wales. As the eldest son and heir apparent, Prince Charles has held the Duchy since the moment he was born and it will pass to the Duke of Cambridge when Charles takes the throne. The Duchy of Cornwall itself was created in 1337 out of what was the Earldom of Cornwall by King Edward III for his son, Edward, Prince of Wales who was better known by the nickname, the Black Prince. Although the Black Prince died before he could become king, the Duchy has since been held by every monarch-in-waiting since, with the exception of Charles II, who was unable to occupy the Duchy thanks to the English Civil War. After the Restoration in 1660, the Duchy was returned to the Crown. Annual visit: Yesterday Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall were in Bude, Cornwall .

A U.S. Marine who was among the soldiers captured on video urinating on the bodies of dead Taliban fighters in Afghanistan says 'hell no' he doesn't regret doing it. And, if given the chance, he'd do it again. Sergeant Joseph Chamblin argues that the infamous 2011 incident, which sparked international outrage and strong condemnation by American officials, was an attempt by the battle-weary Marines to execute 'psychological warfare' - defiling the enemy's corpses in a manner offensive to their Muslim faith. Chamblin told WSOC-TV that the insurgents in the video had been planting improvised explosives and were likely responsible for the death just days earlier of one of the Marines' comrades - Sergeant Mark Bradley, 25, Chamblin said. Outrage: The video inflamed tensions between U.S. forces and the Afghans and was called a 'recruitment tool for the Taliban' A Marine officer in charge of snipers shown in a 2011 video urinating on the corpses of Taliban fighters Afghanistan will be court-martialed . Defiant: Sergeant Joseph Chamblin said he has no retreats about urinating on the Taliban corpses, despite being fine $500 and demoted . The 15-year Marine veteran, who lives outside Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in southeast North Carolina, said he wants the public to understand why the Marines urinated on the bodies. The moment came after a furious gun battle between Chamblin and his fellow Marine snipers and the Taliban insurgents. A dozen of the enemy fighters were killed. 'It's not like it was a conscious thought or decision but someone was like, ""You know what, p*** on these guys."" And someone said, ""Yeah, p*** on them,""' he recalled. Chamblin was one of nine Marines charged by the military as a result of the incident. He received a court-martial and pleaded guilty to urinating on the bodies and of dereliction of duty. He was demoted and fined $500. But Chamblin, who is leaving the Marine Corps and writing a book about his combat experiences, remains defiant. 'Do I regret doing it? Hell no,' he told the TV station. And he's do it again, he said. He rejects accusations from military brass and civilian leadership that his actions put more American troops at danger by inflaming religious tensions in Afghanistan. The video was shot following a furious gun battle in which Chamblin and his unit killed a dozen Taliban fighters . 'If anything, it was more of a psychological effect on the enemy because if an infidel touches the body, they're not going to Mecca or paradise. So, now these insurgents see what happens when you mess with us,' he said. Video of the incident posted on YouTube caused widespread outrage among Afghans. The video shows four Marines in full combat gear urinating on the bodies of three dead Afghans in July 2011. One of the Marines looks down at the bodies and quipps, 'Have a good day, buddy.' The Marine Corps said the urination . took place during a counterinsurgency operation in the Musa Qala . district of Helmand province, located in the south of the country. The urination video surfaced amid a . string of embarrassing episodes for U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Chamblin said he believes the dead insurgents were responsible for the improvised explosive that killed his comrade, Sgt. Mark Bradley . American . troops were caught up in controversies over burning Muslim holy books, . posing for photos with insurgents' bloodied remains and an alleged . massacre of 16 Afghan villagers by a soldier. After the video garnered . international attention on YouTube, senior military officials sternly . condemned the behavior of the Marines involved. The video of the men was called a . 'recruitment tool for the Taliban.' Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said he feared that it could set back . efforts to begin reconciliation talks with the Taliban.

A father of two who had longed to own a Harley Davidson for more than 40 years, was killed in a motorcycle accident as he drove his dream bike home from the shop. Barry Strang, 59, was just easing into semi-retirement in Casper, Wyoming, when his wife, Pam, relented on the idea of him buying a Harley. After putting up a Facebook post, proudly boasting of his new purchase, Mr Strang started his drive home, only to crash into a truck and die three miles into the ride. Dream bike: Barry Strang posted a picture of his new Harley Davidson on Facebook shortly before crashing it . Fatal: Barry Strang, who ran hunting expeditions in Wyoming, was killed three miles into his first ride . His wife of 38 years said that when she heard sirens on the day he collected the motorcycle she feared for the worst, according to the Casper Star Tribune. Mrs Strang, who had driven him to the bike store before heading off to another shop, was stuck in the traffic jam caused by her husband's crash on June 27. She called her . sister, who tried to assure her that it wasn't her husband, but Mrs Strang said she knew he had been killed. 'I felt him,' she said. After leaving the shop in Lander, Mr Strang collided with the axle of a truck tractor on a bend and went under the truck's wheels. He had been wearing a helmet but it flew off in the force of the crash, landing 30ft away. Sergeant Steve Townsend, of Wyoming . Highway Patrol, said the crash could have been caused because Mr Strang . was unfamiliar with his motorcycle, according to County 10. 'The . cause of the crash remains under investigation and troopers are . investigating unfamiliarity with the motorcycle as a contributing . factor. Strang had just purchased the motorcycle brand new and had . driven a distance of 3 miles when he was involved in the crash,' he . said. Tragic: Pam Strang was married to Barry, pictured right with their son Justin, for 38 years . Mrs Strang has remained philosophical about the crash, saying that her husband had lived his life to the fullest. 'It . was something he wanted his whole life. It’s like my son . said, ""Dad went out with the biggest smile on his face"".' She added that for years the couple . would go out for dessert at Baskin-Robbins every Friday  and then window . shop at the Harley Davidson store next door. Mr . Strang, who had two children, Justin 21, and Morgan, 17, and a . granddaughter, had told her owning a Harley was on his bucket list. The family, who were originally from California, had moved to Casper in 1988 to make the most of a rural life. Crash scene: Barry Strang's Harley Davidson in the road after the fatal collision .

He had posted on Facebook that his son was taking over the farm so he could start retirement two days before buying his bike. 'He was a rancher by trade and an outfitter by passion,' his brother, Ron, who also lives in Casper said.","Wyoming farmer collides with truck as he takes motorcycle out for a spin .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 13:01 EST, 16 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:14 EST, 16 July 2013 . A reporter who had an affair with Dateline NBC star Chris Hansen has spoken out about what she says is a double standard against women in broadcast media. The outburst comes as 32-year-old Kristyn Caddell released photographs allegedly showing her kissing Hansen, who had previously said reports of the affair had been 'full of hurtful lies'. Miss Caddell claims that she has not been able to find work since their four-month affair was revealed, while Hansen has continued unscathed by the scandal, according to RadarOnline. Caught on camera: Kristyn Caddell says this photo, allegedly showing Chris Hansen and her kissing, proves their relationship . The reporter said she had worked at three stations since the affair was revealed in 2011, but claims she was unable to hold down a job because of the stigma of the relationship. 'No matter what your philosophy is . on someone who has an affair, if it was the man or the woman’s fault, . there are two people involved and if I can’t work, he should not be able . to work,' Miss Caddell told RadarOnline. 'I have lived the double standard,' she . added. 'A double standard is an understatement as to what happens in . this industry. The women get fired and the men keep going.' Miss Caddell met 54-year-old Hansen in Palm Beach, Florida, when she was a news reporter for NBC affiliate WPTV. She claimed he led her to believe his 20-year marriage to Mary Joan was ending and he was therefore able to date. 'I believed him with my heart,' Miss Caddell, who is not married and does not have children, said. 'You can say I was naive, as it was. That was my biggest crime, being naive ... I make one personal mistake and I am [considered] a worthless human being.' Ruined: Kristyn Caddell claims she has been turned down by news networks because of the affair . Denial: When the National Enquirer first revealed the affair, Chris Hansen said the pair were just friends . Hansen, a father who is best known for his show To Catch a Predator, had previously claimed evidence showing his alleged affair was just a picture of him going out to dinner. 'I understand the perceived irony of . the, you know, so-called ""gotcha guy"" getting gotcha-ed,' he said in March last year. 'But what the ""gotcha guy"" got gotcha-ed . doing was going out to dinner.' The National Enquirer had revealed the affair after the pair were recorded enjoying a romantic dinner at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Manalapan, before spending the night at Miss Caddell's Palm Beach apartment. However, in images Miss Caddell has just released, Hansen is shown kissing her. She claims he did not try to hide their relationship at the time, and she believed it was public knowledge before the Enquirer exposed it. 'Chris was flying me all over the . country; putting us up in the finest hotels; having dinner and mingling . with many of his colleagues; having our photographs taken together in . public places ... Chris . gave me no reason at all to believe our relationship was a secret and I . trusted him explicitly,' she said in an open letter to the Enquirer earlier this month. Miss Caddell said she decided to release the images because the affair was still affecting her ability to find work. She told the National Enquirer that potential employers told her they were put off because of the negative publicity surrounding her. 'For the past two . years, I was told that it would be in my best interests not to say . anything. Let it blow over. Just keep trying to truck along and keep . trying to get jobs. “But we . are here two years later and I probably don’t go a day without an . employer tell me they do not want to hire me because of the situation . involving Chris Hansen.' She added: “I . thought by not saying anything, and Chris advised me that it would be in . my best interest not to say anything, that I would continue to go and and . my life would go back to normal. My life has been the exact opposite of . that.' Dreams shattered: Kristyn Caddell says the scandal has ruined her career as a news reporter . The reporter added that she had struggled to break into journalism, and just before the affair, had finally felt like her career was taking off. 'Then, to essentially get taken down, because of a man, who has a lot of money and a lot of fame, it is not a good feeling. That is what happened to me,' she said. Hansen has previously claimed the pair were no more than friends, according to Fox News.","Kristyn Caddell says news stations are put off by 'negative publicity'

Asiana announced on Wednesday it dropped plans for legal action against a San Francisco TV station over the use of racially offensive names - but 83 passengers of the ill fated flight have said they will sue aircraft manufacturer Boeing and the airline. The South Korean air carrier said that KTVU-TV has already apologized for using fake names for four pilots on a plane that crashed in San Francisco on July 6th and that their efforts were better spent on helping the recovery of the survivors and their families. And in a sign of the post-traumatic stress caused by the crash which killed three, Asiana revealed that the four pilots of the Boeing 777 have been hospitalized in South Korea 'for psychological trauma and injuries caused by the incident.' No Lawsuit: KTVU News read these names live on television today stating that the National Transportation Safety Board had confirmed that these were the pilots of Asiana 214 . Broken news: Anchor Tori Campbell read the names off the teleprompter and didn't bat an eye, adding that the information had been confirmed by the National Transportation Safety Board . The Associated Press spoke to officials in South Korea's Land, Infrastructure and Transport Ministry on the condition of anonymity and follows medical checkups the pilots received on returning home over the weekend. Last week, an anchor for KTVU-TV read the fake names – apparently someone's idea of a prank to use fake Asian-style names that sounded out distress calls and curse words – on air and then apologized after a break. Asiana earlier said the report seriously damaged its reputation. It said Monday that it would sue the TV station to respond to the racially discriminatory report that disparaged Asians. The airline had said this week that it would sue the television station because the reporting defamed the pilots and the company.

Aftermath: The wreckage of Asiana Flight 214 on the ground after it crashed at the San Francisco International Airport, in San Francisco . The crash of the Boeing 777 plane resulted in the death of three Chinese teenage girls who were visiting the United States for a summer camp. More than 180 passengers and crew members were injured. 'Asiana Airlines has decided not to proceed with the case since KTVU has issued a formal apology and in order for us to focus all our efforts on managing the aftermath of the accident,' the South Korean company said in a statement, according to Reuters. KTVU-TV was quick to correct the gaffe after an ad break following the humiliating broadcast, clarifying the names were clearly wrong and blaming the NTSB for the incorrect information. The NTSB also apologized, releasing a statement admitting a summer intern had 'erroneously' confirmed the names. 'The National Transportation Safety Board apologizes for inaccurate and offensive names that were mistakenly confirmed as those of the pilots of Asiana flight 214, which crashed at San Francisco International Airport on July 6,' the NTSB said last week.

Horror: This image released by the National Transportation Safety Board, on Thursday, July 11, 2013, shows the charred remains of Asiana Airlines Flight 214 in San Francisco . On Wednesday, a Chicago law firm announced that  it has taken steps to sue aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. on behalf of 83 people who were aboard the Asiana Airlines flight that crash-landed in San Francisco earlier this month, claiming in a court filing that the crash might have been caused by a mechanical malfunction of the Boeing 777's auto throttle. Ribbeck Law Chartered on Monday filed a petition for discovery - a move meant to preserve evidence - in Cook County Circuit Court in Chicago, where Boeing is headquartered. The law firm said in a news release that additional pleadings will be filed against Asiana Airlines and several component parts manufacturers in coming days. Ribbeck said that in addition to potential problems with the auto throttle, some emergency slides reportedly opened inside the plane, injuring passengers and blocking their exit, and some passengers had to be cut out of their seat-belts with a knife.

Three people were killed when the airplane, carrying 307 passengers and crew on a flight from South Korea to San Francisco International Airport on July 6th, approached the runway too low and slow. It clipped a seawall at the end of a runway, tearing off the tail and sending the plane spinning down the runway. The impact caused the plane to catch fire. 'We must find the causes of the crash and demand that the problems with the airline and the aircraft are immediately resolved to avoid future tragedies,' attorney Monica R. Kelly, head of Ribbeck's aviation department, said in a written statement. Boeing spokesman John Dern said the company had no comment.

It also seeks information on the systems that indicate the airplane's glide slope and that warn how close it is to the ground.

A new report from Transparency International, which focuses on corruption around the world, found that a local hospital in one of Africa’s poorest countries was administering the hospital screaming fee to women who 'raised a false alarm'. Hospitals in Zimbabwe charge a $50 (£33) delivery fee on top of that so with the average person's annual income at around $150 (£99), mothers who scream several times may have to part with half of their annual income. New Zimbabwean mothers are charged a $5 (£3.30) 'screaming fee' whilst giving birth in hospital as well as a $50 (£33) delivery fee (stock image) And worse still, the report found that those women who couldn't afford the fees were sometimes detained at the hospital, being charged interest until their family were able to pay off the debts for them. This leads numerous Zimbabwean mothers to give birth at home because they simply can’t afford the charges. The United Nations found that on average eight mothers die every day during childbirth in the poverty-stricken country. The Washington Post reports that Transparency International's Zimbabwe office contacted the national health ministry by sending a formal letter regarding the issue. The report also found that those women who couldn't afford the fees were sometimes detained at the hospital, being charged interest until their family can pay off the debts (stock image) While the health ministry confirmed it had received the letter, they apparently did nothing about it. When the NGO later contacted them to follow up, an official said that they had lost the letter. A member of Transparency International then met with Arthur Mutambara, Zimbabwe’s deputy prime minister, who promised them he would look into the screaming fee issue. The NGO now say they have had no more complaints about screaming charges; however, the $50 (£33) delivery charge still remains. The screaming fee is just one of many examples of corruption in Zimbabwe. It has also been revealed that a staggering 62 percent of people have paid a bribe to a public official in the past year.","Hospital charging $5 (£3.30) for every 'false alarm' they raise by crying out .

A child serial killer has confessed to murdering a 16-year-old boy 21 years ago and dumping his remains in a 58-foot deep lake. Lewis S. Lent Jr., who is serving a life sentence for a separate murder conviction, has described step-by-step how he kidnapped Jamie Lusher from a street in Westfield, Massachusetts on November 2, 1992, and cut short his young life before getting rid of the body in Greenwater Pond in nearby Becket. Police divers from Massachusetts and New York will begin searching for the teen's remains in the 80 acre pond tomorrow, hoping to give his family closure in the cold case. Killer: Lewis Lent, pictured in 1997, has confessed to the slaying of Jamie Lusher, 16, in 1992 . 'To this day, when I see a kid, a 16-year-old kid on a bike with black hair, I will instinctively look,' the victim's father, James Lusher, told reporters today, according to the Boston Globe. 'My closure is finding my son.' Hampden District Attorney Mark Mastroianni, Berkshire District Attorney David Capeless, State Police Colonel Timothy Alben and Westfield Police Captain Michael McCabe said in a joint press conference that Lent confessed to the killing in return for not being prosecuted for the crime. Lent was arrested and charged in January 1994 with kidnapping and assaulting Rebecca Savarese, 12, of Pittsfield. She managed to escaped and alert police. During three days of questioning, Lent confessed to the attempted abduction as well as to two child murders. He was convicted in the 1990 kidnapping and murder of James Bernardo, 12, of Pittsfield.

'Lent is someone who law enforcement here and in other places is very interested in,' he said. 'He is a subject that is on the radar for other cases. This information and the new information gathered from Lewis Lent has reinvigorated investigations.' Jamie Lusher's father said that while Lent obviously dumped his son's body in the pond to hide the evidence of his crime, his choice of where he laid the 16-year-old to rest offered some peace to the family.

Separate convictions: Lent, pictured, is serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole for separate child murders . 'Unwittingly, Lewis Lent put my son where he loved to be — he loved the mountains,' Lusher said. 'So, if in fact they never find anything, he's where he loved to be.' He added that closure was finding his son and that he wasn't bothered about Lent being prosecuted in the killing. 'I couldn't care less what happens to Lewis Lent,' he said. 'He can rot in hell, I don't care.' The boy's sister, Jennifer Nowak, agreed. 'There is no closure unless we have the person,' she said. 'We don't have anything. We've never had anything.'","Authorities announced today that Lewis S. Lent Jr. has admitted to the 1992 slaying of Jamie Lusher, 16 .

An embarrassing paperwork bungle has seen a convicted killer held for extradition over the vicious murder of a 'well-liked family man' in March walk free a month later - and the victim's family is furious. Robert Craig Sandman, 52, was a 'person of interest' in the murder of Donald Singer, found dead and wrapped in blankets in his garage in Duluth, . Georgia, and his red 1988 Porsche missing, in late March. Police arrested Sandman on April 7 for theft after seeing him driving the vehicle in New Mexico, and then discovering he had a warrant out of Georgia in Singer's murder. Sandman was due to be extradited for questioning over the murder that month, but authorities sent the paperwork to the wrong place and let him go. Tragic: Don Singer, who grew up in Sleepy Hollow, was found dead in the garage of his suburban Georgia home in March . Duluth police discovered the . paperwork mix-up on July 10 after looking into Sandman's filed and . finding he was no longer in police custody. According to kasa.com, Duluth police planned to extradite Sandman back to Georgia for . questioning, with an extradition hearing to be held in Sandoval County on . April 19. However, according to a May 13 court order, . District Judge George Eichwald released Sandman from detention because the state of . Georgia failed to organize the extradition within 20 days of the April . hearing. Duluth police Captain Mark Hunter told Atlanta Journal-Constitution Sandoval County . officials sent notice to the state probation office and not the Gwinnett . County Sheriff’s Department, which handles extraditions for its . municipal police departments. 'Gwinnett never received any notice that he was ready for transfer and neither did we,' he said.

'It's tough on everybody. It's tough on the brothers and the sisters. 'It's tough on his children.' Singer’s body was found by his daughter. Torres Cappello said Sandman would still be in custody if 'someone just picked up the phone and followed up'. 'I am disgusted that our justice system released a known murderer,' she told Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 'Now . you have a dangerous man back on the streets. People should be outraged that this could ever happen.' State prison records reportedly show Sandman, 52, served nine years for second-degree murder in New Mexico during the 1990s.

Accused: Desmond Hughes, 65, and his partner have been charged with harassment after putting up security cameras around their house . A former House of Lords special adviser was yesterday accused of using security cameras to spy on a teenage girl next door. Political aide Desmond Hughes, 65, and his partner were charged with harassment after their neighbours alleged the couple had rigged up cameras to watch their house. A court heard that Hughes also stared at Tania Hancock, 18, through her bedroom window.Miss Hancock said her family moved in next door to Hughes and his partner Clare Anderson, 50, in 2011, in the wealthy Cardiff suburb of Old St Mellons. The couple had lived there  since 2006.Hughes claimed he had mounted the devices after receiving ‘security advice’ from ‘senior officers from ex-forces’. But Miss Hancock told the court the couple erected surveillance cameras aimed ‘on to our back garden and pointed directly on to our drive’. She said: ‘It was directly angled. It wasn’t pointed on to his property – just ours. I’m certain it was pointing directly on to our garden.’ Miss Hancock also accused Hughes and his partner of staring at her through the window of her bedroom. ‘They would always look up at my window,’ she said. ‘I was always aware of that from the moment I moved in. ‘They would stand there with their hands on their hips staring up at my bedroom until I moved away from my window. ‘I thought it was odd behaviour to stand and stare up at somebody.’ Adam Corbin, prosecuting, asked when the alleged staring had stopped. Miss Hancock told Cardiff Magistrates’ Court: ‘It hasn’t stopped. It’s whenever they’re on their drive. On trial: Desmond Hughes and partner Clare Anderson both denied a charge of harassment at Cardiff Magistrates' Court . 'My mum would always tell me to . ignore them but it got to the point where I felt really intimidated by . them. Whenever I’m in my bedroom now my curtains are always drawn.’ Giles Newell, defending, said Miss . Hancock ‘can’t be sure what exactly these cameras are focusing on’ and . that she had ‘never asked why they have got those cameras’. Police officer Christopher Fennessy . confirmed there were a number of cameras on Hughes’s property. But he . said no evidence of recordings had been found during a search of the . house. Hughes said: ‘My security advice comes from the security industry as well as senior officers from ex-forces.’ He admitted he had three cameras . attached to both the front and back of his house when the Hancocks moved . in next door, and said that he owned an extensive collection of . ‘firearms, shotguns and various explosives’. But he added: ‘I’ve never had cause to point the cameras in the direction of either the Hancocks’ garden or driveway. ‘They’re just placed there and that was the end of it – they were placed there in 2006.’ He said most of the six cameras were . not even working. Mr Newell told the court Hughes and Anderson had no . previous convictions and the situation between the couple and the . Hancock family had ‘become melodramatic’. Both defendants have denied harassment. District Judge Bodfan Jenkins adjourned the case to today when he is expected to give a verdict. Hughes was a special adviser to Labour’s Lord Corbett, Baron Corbett of Castle Vale. The peer became MP for Birmingham . Erdington in 1983, and held the seat until he joined the Lords in 2001. He died in February last year, aged 78. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Desmond Hughes, 65, and his partner accused of harassment .

The captain of a ship caught smuggling missiles through the Panama Canal gave investigators a big heads up the North Korean vessel was up to no good. As Panama authorities sought to board the ship, its panicked leader had a heart attack and tried to kill himself. The 35 North Koreans aboard, meanwhile, did everything they could to resist arrest ahead of the discovery of weapons system parts buried under sacks of sugar. And it was all over some seriously outdated equipment. Clued in: Photos of the crew of the Chong Chon Gang hang in the ship. As suspicious Panama authorities went aboard to conduct a search, the ship's captain had a heart attack and attempted suicide . Something's wrong here: As Panamanian air and sea police oficers boarded the Chong Chong Gang, the ship's crew of 35 resisted them and then tried to resist arrest . A private defense analysis firm that . examined a photograph of the find said the ship appeared to be . transporting a radar-control system for a Soviet-era surface-to-air . missile system, and Cuba later called the equipment on the boat . ‘obsolete defensive weapons’ from the mid-20th century. A . statement from Cuba's Foreign Ministry late Tuesday acknowledged that . the military equipment belonged to the Caribbean nation, but said it had . been shipped out to be repaired and returned to the island. It said the 240 metric tons of weaponry consisted of two Volga and Pechora anti-aircraft missile systems, nine missiles ‘in parts and spares,’ two Mig-21 Bis and 15 engines for those airplanes. Old school: Military equipment smuggled aboard the ship in under sugar sacks has been identified as obsolete, Soviet-era weaponry . Photos of late North Korean autocrats Kim il-Sung and Kim Jong-il hang in many of the ship's crew quarters. All 35 crew members were arrested . Panama's President Ricardo Martinelli walks up a ramp to the North Korean-flagged ship. He would later post photos of the missiles to Twitter . ‘The agreements subscribed by Cuba in . this field are supported by the need to maintain our defensive capacity . in order to preserve national sovereignty,’ the statement read. It concluded by saying that Havana remains ‘unwavering’ in its commitment to international law, peace and nuclear disarmament. Earlier, . Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli said the ship identified as the . 14,000-ton Chong Chon Gang was carrying missiles and other arms ‘hidden . in containers underneath the cargo of sugar.’ Martinelli tweeted a photo showing a green tube that appears to be a horizontal antenna for the SNR-75 ‘Fan Song’ radar, which used to guide missiles fired by the SA-2 air-defense system found in former Warsaw Pact and Soviet-allied nations, said Neil Ashdown, an analyst for IHS Jane's Intelligence. Sleepy time: One detained North Korean crew member sleeps aboard the Chong Chon Gang . Long haul: Panama's President Ricardo Martinelli gives a thumbs up to workers inside the Chong Chon Gang. Searching the entire cargo hold will take several more days . ‘It is possible that this could be . being sent to North Korea to update its high-altitude air-defense . capabilities,’ Ashdown said. Jane's also said the equipment could be . headed to North Korea to be upgraded. Panamanian . authorities said one container buried under sugar sacks contained radar . equipment that appears to be designed for use with air-to-air or . surface-to-air missiles, said Belsio Gonzalez, director of Panama's . National Aeronautics and Ocean Administration. An Associated Press . journalist who gained access to the rusting ship saw green shipping . containers that had been covered by hundreds, perhaps thousands, of . white sacks marked ‘Cuban Raw Sugar.’ The U.N. Security Council has imposed four rounds of increasingly tougher sanctions against North Korea since its first nuclear test on Oct. 9, 2006. Under current sanctions, all U.N. member states are prohibited from directly or indirectly supplying, selling or transferring all arms, missiles or missile systems and the equipment and technology to make them to North Korea, with the exception of small arms and light weapons. The most recent resolution, approved in March after Pyongyang's latest nuclear test, authorizes all countries to inspect cargo in or transiting through their territory that originated in North Korea, or is destined to North Korea if a state has credible information the cargo could violate Security Council resolutions. Still searching: A worker inspects the Chong Chon Gang at the Manzanillo Container Terminal in Colon City. The country requested help in searching the ship from Colombia, UK, and United Nations authorities . Powerful drug: The ship has been under scrutiny from international authorities since 2009 and Panamanian police originally boarded in the belief it carried drugs . Going home: Panamanian presidential security detail walks on the deck aboard the Chong Chon Gang, which was on its way home from Havanna carrying outdated weaponry . ‘Panama obviously has an important responsibility to ensure that the Panama Canal is utilized for safe and legal commerce,’ said Acting U.S. Ambassador Rosemary DiCarlo, who is the current Security Council president. ‘Shipments of arms or related material to or from Korea would violate Security Council resolutions, three of them as a matter of fact.’ Panamanian authorities believe the ship was returning from Havana on its way to North Korea, Panamanian Public Security Minister Jose Raul Mulino told The Associated Press. Based on unspecified intelligence, authorities suspected it could be carrying contraband and tried to communicate with the crew, who didn't respond. Martinelli said Panama originally suspected drugs could be aboard. International incident: A Panamanian police stands guard in the ship as authorities await the assistance of several other countries, as well as the United Nations . Misunderstanding? Cuba announced late Tuesday that the equipment did indeed come from Havana, but was just going out for repairs . His greatness: A security guard is reflected on a photo of former leader Kim Jong-il and former president Kim Il-sung inside the ship, now swarming with Panama police . Everyone on the boat, called the Chong Chon Gang, were arrested after resisting police efforts to intercept the ship in Panamanian waters on Thursday as it moved toward the canal and take it to the Caribbean port of Manzanillo, Martinelli told private RPC radio station. Panamanian officials were finally able to board the ship to begin searching it Monday, pulling out hundreds of sacks of sugar. Luis Eduardo Camacho, a spokesman for Martinelli, said authorities had only searched one of the ship's five container sections, and the inspection of all the cargo will take at least a week. Panama has requested help from United Nations inspectors, along with Colombia and the UK, said Javier Carballo, the country's top narcotics prosecutor. ‘Panama being a neutral country, a country in peace, that doesn't like war, we feel very worried about this military material,’ Martinelli said. The 35-man crew on board the Chong Chon Gang (pictured at the Panama port) rioted and the captain tried to kill himself when Panamanian authorities intercepted it . The crew have been arrested and the ship has been detained at the Manzanillo International terminal . The president announced the ship had been detained through Twitter . North Korea's government made no public comment on the case. In . early July, a top North Korean general, Kim Kyok Sik, visited Cuba and . met with his island counterparts. Cuban Communist Party newspaper Granma . said he was also received by President Raul Castro, and the two had an . ‘exchange about the historical ties that unite the two nations and the . common will to continue strengthening them.’ The meetings were held behind closed doors, and there has been no detailed account of their discussions. Panama President Ricardo Martinelli tweeted this picture of what he said were undeclared weapons and later identified as outdated, Soviet-era arms . The ship was stopped on the way to the Panama Canal (file picture) on suspicion it was carrying drugs . ‘After . this incident there should be renewed focus on North Korean-Cuban . links,’ said Hugh Griffiths, an arms trafficking expert at the Stockholm . International Peace Research Institute. Griffiths said his institute . told the U.N. this year that it had uncovered evidence of a flight from . Cuba to North Korea that travelled via central Africa. ‘Given . the history of North Korea, Cuban military cooperation and now this . latest seizure, we find this flight more interesting,’ he said. ‘ . The . Chong Chon Gang has a history of being detained on suspicion of . trafficking drugs and ammunition, Griffiths said. Lloyd's List . Intelligence said the 34-year-old ship, which is registered to the . Pyongyang-based Chongchongang Shipping Company, ‘has a long history of . detentions for safety deficiencies and other undeclared reasons.’ Undercover? The bags were labeled Cuban Raw Sugar . Not so sweet: Cuba officially identified the equipment late Tuesday as two Volga and Pechora anti-aircraft missile systems, nine missiles, two Mig-21 Bis and 15 engines for those airplanes . Satellite . tracking records show it left the Pacific Coast of Russia on April 12 . with a stated destination of Havana, then crossed the Pacific and the . Panama Canal on its way to the Caribbean. It disappeared from satellite . tracking until it showed up again on the Caribbean side of the canal, on . July 10, Lloyd's said. The . disappearance from satellite tracking indicates that the crew may have . switched off a device that automatically transmits the ship's location . after it moved into the Caribbean, Lloyd's said. Mulino, . the Panamanian public security minister, said the ship crossed the . Panama Canal from the Pacific to the Caribbean last month carrying a . cargo of sheet metal that was inspected by Panamanian authorities. Griffiths . said the Chong Chon Gang was stopped in 2010 in the Ukraine and was . attacked by pirates 400 miles off the coast of Somalia in 2009. Griffiths' institute has also been interested in the ship because of a 2009 stop . it made in Tartus - a Syrian port city hosting a Russian naval base.

State officers in Texas have arrested a woman after finding the body of 57-year old husband who had been missing for three years. The Texas Rangers dug up Ervin Robinson’s remains in the front yard of the Pelican Bay rural home where he used to live. The Rangers had been investigating Robinson’s disappearance since he vanished in May 2010. Charged: Neola Robinson, 62, is charged in connection with the murder of her husband, Ervin Robinson . Buried: The body of Neola Robinson's husband, Ervin, was found in the front yard of the home where they used to live . Authorities arrested Neola Robinson, 62 on Saturday in connection with her husband’s murder. She is in Tarrant County Jail in lieu of $150,000 bail. She is also on suicide watch and is awaiting a full mental health evaluation. New information in the case led investigators to the Robinson home over the weekend. A criminal background check showed Ervin Robinson had several arrests, including burglary, theft and multiple DWIs. Hidden in plain sight: Ervin had gone missing in May 2010 yet his wife simply told people that he had left her for another woman . Marital troubles: The couple were often heard arguing and had violent episodes but it has still come as shock to many in the community . Neighbors say Texas Rangers surrounded the mobile home on Saturday. Carolann Wheless, a neighbor, said she is shocked by Neola Robinson's arrest. 'In the front yard of all places -- I mean, how do you get away with something like that?' Ms Wheless said. Ervin Robinson has been missing since May 2010. His boss, Michael Wright, filed a missing person's report when he didn't show up for work for nearly two weeks. His boss said he knew something was wrong when Ervin didn't show up for work, or even pick-up his last paycheck. 'Never . missed any time without setting up a vacation or calling in so when he . didn't show I mean it was very uncharacteristic of him,' said Michael . Wright, Ervin's boss. Some neighbors said the couple had a volatile, and at times violent relationship. Others had suspicions that Neola Robinson might have had something to do with her husband’s disappearance. 'I . actually heard [Neola Robinson] tell someone at a bar, ‘You shouldn’t . sit by me, I might kill ya.’ She laughed, then everybody pretty much . just stopped talking to her,' said Lanie Lindsey. Disbelief: Neighbours cannot believe how a woman who is on disability benefits was able to bury her husbands body in their front yard . Good inentions: Although Ervin Robinson had a lengthy criminal history including robbery and DWI, his friends say he was turning things around. His wife remains in Tarrant County Jail on $150,000 bail . But . Lindsey said the suspicions deepened as Shorty’s friends refused to . believe he’d leave town without saying goodbye, and without telling his . boss. 'And get this,' she . added, 'he left his Harley, his prize possession. He was a biker. Who . would do that? That’s when people started getting suspicious. If he was . going to take off, he’d have told someone.'","Ervin Robinson disappeared in May 2010 .

Hundreds of criminals - including more than a dozen murderers - are on the run in England and Wales after absconding, figures revealed today. Authorities admit they are unsure of the whereabouts of more than 800 missing prisoners, including 15 killers serving life sentences. A Freedom of Information Act response to The Times said rapists and other violent criminals were also counted among those at large. The figures revealed a total of 821 prisoners are currently unaccounted for, despite having broken the terms of their parole and being recalled to custody at least 12 months ago. It is estimated that nearly 400 of those who have absconded have fled abroad, while two criminals are thought to have died, the newspaper said. The figures state nearly 500 breached their parole after failing to stay in touch with the Probation Service, while 33 were recalled to face further charges. A Prison Service spokesman said: ‘In more than 99 per cent of cases where an offender has been recalled, the individual has been successfully returned to custody. ‘Where an offender flees the country and their whereabouts are known, the UK does everything it can to return them to custody.’ Absconded: Craig Black, who was jailed for life in 1995, left HMP Leyhill (pictured) in South Gloucestershire . Javed Khan, chief executive of Victim Support, told The .

The sons of a couple found dead in their flat in an exclusive part of London today paid tribute to their mother, who is believed to have been strangled by her husband. A note left outside the Bloomsbury flat where Robert Mercati, 63, is said to have attacked his pensioner wife Margaret before killing himself, speaks of a mother described as 'our strength and the best of us'. Mr Mercati, a grandfather who had been to prison for his part in a £200,000 diamond heist a decade ago, and his wife were found in their flat in Rugby Street, close to Russell Square, on Wednesday afternoon.  They had sons aged 29 and 32. The note believed to be from their . sons reads: 'In loving memory of Mum.  Words cannot express the hole . that will be left in our hearts.  You was (sic) our strength and the best of us. We’ll love you forever and live for your memory. 'You're with your brothers and sisters ...and your Mum and Dad..' and is signed: 'Your sons and family & the bubbas'. Another note left at the scene said: . 'We are so sorry to have lost two beautiful, special people. You will . always be in our memories.' A neighbour of the couple described them both as 'volatile', and said the Mercatis were often to be heard arguing, most recently at 6am on the morning they died.  The neighbour believed Mrs Mercati was attacked some time before noon, with her husband dying soon afterwards. The couple are believed to have been discovered on Wednesday afternoon after one of their sons arrived at the flat and got in through a side door. He called an ambulance and paramedics found the female victim in her 60s, before finding her husband's body behind their flat. A Scotland Yard spokesman said it was . a murder investigation but at this early stage officers were not . looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths. Police were called by London Ambulance Service to the flat shortly before 1.45pm on Wednesday, following reports that a woman had been found injured. The woman was treated at the scene . following an apparent assault but was pronounced dead at 2.10pm. The man . was pronounced dead one minute later. A policeman guards the crime scene in Bloomsbury, central London, as floral tributes are left outside the flat for the couple, named locally as Robert and Margaret Mercati . Flowers left outside the flat bore a poignant note to a mother described as 'our strength and the best of us' Friends and neighbours left flowers and messages in tribute to the couple while officers guarded the flat . They confirmed the deceased are a husband and wife, and next of kin have been told of their deaths. A neighbour who lived close to the Mercatis for several years told MailOnline: 'I knew them both quite well and they were very nice people, always extremely polite and friendly, but they argued frequently. 'She suffered from depression and was house-bound because of that.  I didn't see her out for about two years and then recently I've seen her out. 'They definitely both had volatile tempers  - she was quite argumentative and he had a long history of alcoholism, but he said he'd given up a couple of years ago. 'They were always extremely smartly dressed - his father was a tailor - and were both born in Covent Garden, her in Earlham Street and Bob in Seven Dials.' The neighbour, who said heard a commotion in the couple's flat shortly after Mr Mercati is believed to have attacked his wife, said Mr Mercati would often look after his small grandson in the afternoons. Barber Mus Ismail, 35, who runs the . hairdresser where the Mercatis have been going for years and who cut Mr . Mercati's hair last weekend, said they seemed 'a very happy couple'. Mr . Ismail, who owns Ted's Grooming Room in Theobald's Road, Holborn said: . 'He was in on Saturday, seemed good as gold, no problems at all. 'He was just normal, nothing unusual. They seemed like a happy couple - a very happy couple, nothing out of the ordinary. 'They seemed a lot more together than . not together, they were always going here and there together.  He was a . bit of a character, always bubbly and friendly. Just a character . really.' Police officers stand guard outside the smart Bloomsbury flat where the married couple were found dead . This note was left by a local business, paying tribute to the husband and wife they obviously knew so well . The flat in Rugby Street, close to Great Ormond Street hospital, is believed to be privately owned . Mr Ismail added: 'He had the full treatment, haircut, shave, he looked good and seemed healthy, tanned. I definitely didn't see any problems. 'He's come here since we opened 15 years ago. Before me, it was my dad who used to cut his hair. He comes in with his sons sometimes. 'On Saturday he was really looking good, we just talked casually like ""how you doing?' nothing out of the ordinary. 'Someone popped the same day [he died] and told us. I didn't know what to think, I thought maybe it was a break-in and someone had killed them. 'I just didn't believe it until I saw the flowers outside and the police.' Robert and Margaret Mercati, who had two grown-up sons, were found dead at home on Wednesday . Floral tributes to the couple were left outside their flat in the upmarket Bloomsbury district of London . Post-mortem examinations took place . yesterday at St Pancras Mortuary and gave the causes of death as . strangulation for the woman and injuries consistent with hanging for the . man. In 2004 Mr Mercati was given an . 18-month prison sentence after being convicted of stealing diamonds . worth more than £200,000 from a display cabinet in the upmarket Berkeley . Hotel in Knightsbridge. A . subsequent case at Southwark Crown Court heard that Mercati, then aged . 54, and his friend Stephen Ward, then 31, used duplicate keys to unlock . the cabinets and took gems valued at £209,000 designed by celebrity . favourite Sasha Ratiu. A . diamond necklace, tiara and ring, as well as other rings, earrings, . bracelets, pendants and brooches encrusted with diamonds, rubies, . sapphires and blue topaz were among the 21 pieces of jewellery stolen . from the showcases in May 2003. The couple's hairdresser said he saw Mr Mercati at the weekend and described him as 'bubbly and friendly' The thieves escaped with the jewels, but were caught on the hotel's CCTV cameras and the footage was later shown on Crimewatch which led to police arresting them. The court heard that Mercati suffered poor health and was described as an 'unlikely accomplice' in the crime. In 2011 Robert Mercati was convicted of shoplifting from a designer store in Bicester Village and given a 12-month suspended jail sentence and ordered to do 250 hours of unpaid work. Oxford Crown Court heard that Mercati stole two Alfred Dunhill coats on January 8 2011, and was also present at an earlier theft when his friend Peter Ladlow, also from London, stole a designer bag from Christian Dior a month earlier. Mercati’s lawyer told the court that his client lived on benefits and cared for his wife.

The court was told that he had followed the unarmed youngster through a park because he looked like he was 'up to no good.'

Yesterday protests spread across the country in a second day of demonstrations in the wake of the sensational not-guilty verdict. Demonstrations, from Florida where the trial took place to Atlanta, DC and New York, remained largely peaceful, though Los Angeles protesters managed to shut down an entire freeway and thousands of New Yorkers mobbed Times Square and blocked traffic for an hour.

Tragic: Donations to Susan Taylor's chosen charities have reached £50,000 since she died trying to swim the English Channel . The distraught husband of  charity swimmer Susan Taylor last night spoke of his heartbreak after watching his wife collapse and die as she attempted to swim the Channel. Speaking in Boulogne, where his wife of six years was airlifted to hospital on Sunday, Stephen Taylor, 43, said he was ‘proud to have been part of his beautiful wife’s life’ and was ‘devastated by her loss’. His comments came as donations to Mrs Taylor’s charity pages for terminally ill children and diabetes research soared to over £61,000. The 34-year-old suffered a  cardiac arrest just one mile from France as she pursued her dream of swimming the Channel. Her husband said in a statement: ‘Susan was a determined, strong and dedicated person who gave her everything to whatever she did. 'She would have been so proud of the massive response and support for her chosen charities, Diabetes UK and Rainbows children’s hospice.’ It emerged that Mrs Taylor, of Barwell, . Leicestershire, had vomited several times due to fatigue and a reaction from the salt water. She was dragged from the water by her support team but was declared dead on arrival at Boulogne hospital. Thousands of people have since donated money to the charities, Rainbows Hospice and Diabetes UK, Mrs Taylor was raising money for. The money was boosted when comedian David Walliams - who swam the Channel in 2006 - tweeted the links to the charities to his 1.2million followers. He is believed to have pledged £1,000 after a donation was made under the name of the Little Britain star with the message 'Sending all my love to Susan's family and friends'. Walliams tweeted later: 'Despite the shock & sadness, it's good to see heroic Susan Taylor's charity total rising. Please give what you can...'

I was going to help her achieve her amazing goal that she had set out on two years ago. 'Her commitment to her training meant that she had put on hold her career as an accountant so that she could give, because this was what Susan was really about. 'She was a natural giver. So when Susan approached me two years ago and asked me if I would be so kind as to help her on her journey - she told me that she was swimming for charity, the Rainbows Hospice charity based in Loughborough, my home town. Having taught children with severe learning difficulties myself for a short time, the answer was a no-brainer. 'She then added Diabetes UK - again as a Type 2 diabetic myself, no brainer. On top of this, she endlessly worked as an ambassador for Rainbows Hospice charity.'

The family chose to lay him to rest alongside his great-grandmother in a secluded spot near where Doreen Lawrence used to play as as a child. However, the exact location of the grave . remains a fiercely guarded secret, she said, to allow her to visit him . in peace and quietly reflect. She told the BBC's Panorama programme that his family feared his grave would be desecrated if it was in the UK. Private grief: Stephen's grave is in a secret location in Jamaica, next to that of his great-grandmother . Resting place: Stephen Lawrence's mother says her son is buried in the Caribbean because Britain 'didn't deserve to have him' Fading: Mrs Lawrence said it will soon be time to change the photo of her son on the grave . Mrs Lawrence, who came to the UK at the age of nine, said: 'Here nobody knows where he is. 'Then . again, I don't think the country deserves to have his body there anyway . because they took his life. 'I think it's still the best thing we did, that we brought him here so he can be next to his great-grandmother so she can look after him.' She added: 'I am really pleased I have . buried him here, because had he been buried in the UK his grave would . have been desecrated so many times.' The grave bears a picture of her murdered son which will soon be replaced because it is fading, Mrs Lawrence said. In the programme Mrs Lawrence looks through pictures of Stephen as a child and says she is protective of his memory. She says: 'I don't like the idea of too many . photos of Stephen being out. I just think everybody seems to want to . have photos of him and I just think ""no"". 'The one is enough, that way you have some control.' Mrs Lawrence makes a visit to her son's grave in an area of Jamaica where she used to play as a child . Memory: Stephen's grave in a remote corner of Jamaica. The exact location is a secret, to enable the family to visit him in peace . With his family; Stephen's grave, right, is beside that of his great-grandmother . Mrs Lawrence can also be seen looking at Stephen's cap and jumper, complete with badges, from when he was a cub and scout. She leafs through some of his writings but says she still cannot bring herself to read them. 'I came across this. He did it on April 7, 15 days before he died he did it,' she says. 'I can't read it, I find it difficult, when I look at what he could achieve. I'm not ready to read this yet.' Yesterday there was finally some justice for her son after an 18-year ordeal. As well as the immeasurable grief and anger caused by the murder of her son, she and her husband Neville, their marriage already under strain, were finally driven apart by Stephen's death. As the verdicts on Gary Dobson and David Norris were returned the Lawrences sat ten feet apart, but wept at exactly the same time. During the BBC Panorama programme Mrs Lawrence is seen going through Stephen's childhood belongings . Police set up a mobile surveillance van to prevent Stephen Lawrence’s memorial plaque being vandalised yesterday. The van positioned its cameras on the black marble dedication that marks the spot where he died on Well Hall Road, Eltham, South East London in 1993.It came after a string of racial abuse was aimed at mourners who came to leave flowers on Tuesday by passing motorists after Gary Dobson and David Norris were found guilty of his murder. Police patrolled the road fearing another racist attack could be carried out on the memorial. Dozens of flowers were laid around the memorial – mostly by people who did not know the 18-year-old A-level student. The plaque has been targeted three times in the 16 years since it was positioned at the site of the stabbing. On one occasion it was chipped and it has also had paint and flammable liquids poured on it. After the two men had been found guilty, . Doreen Lawrence was applauded as she read a statement outside the Old . Bailey. But this wasn’t a cause for celebration, she said. ‘How can I celebrate when my son lies . buried? When I cannot see him or speak to him? 'When will I see him grow . up and go to university or get married or have children? These verdicts . will not bring my son back. ‘How can I celebrate when I know that . this day could have come 18 years ago if the police, who were meant to . find my son’s killers, had not failed so miserably to do so?' Of Stephen she said: ‘I now want . people to remember him as a bright, beautiful young man who any parent . of whatever background would have been proud of. ‘He was a wonderful son and a shining . example of what any parent would want in a child. 'I miss him with a . passion. Hopefully now he can rest in peace.’ When she visited Stephen's grave in March she told the BBC that when she returned she would like to be able to tell him that someone had gone to prison for his death. At least now she can. Doreen Lawrence uses her visits to the grave to quietly reflect on her Stephen's life . By PAUL HARRIS AND DAVID JONES . UPDATED: . 05:20 EST, 17 July 2013 . He was 18 and on the brink of fulfilling his ambition to train as an architect. In . school he was a promising student; outside, a burgeoning athlete. By . the time six weeks of evidence came to a close at the Old Bailey, the . jury knew everything about Stephen Lawrence’s death, right down to the . angle the knife was plunged into his chest. They . knew virtually nothing about his life. Remarkably, they were never even . shown his photograph. In truth, his story is unremarkable – but one . which illustrates how a single act of  violence snatched away a young . man’s future and devastated an ordinary, decent family. The . oldest of three children, Stephen was born on September 13, 1974. His . brother Stuart is two years younger and sister Georgina six years . younger. The brothers . squabbled like any teenage siblings, but remained close. Days before he . died, Stephen had forgiven Stuart for dismantling his Sony Walkman to . see how it worked. Stuart, . now a teacher, has previously said: ‘It was great having a big brother. No-one messed with me. Stephen was tall and cool and had lots of . friends.’ When the . children were growing up, the Lawrences did everything as a family. They . attended the local Trinity Methodist Church, where Stephen volunteered . to help old people. The family ate together around the table when . possible and went on traditional English holidays. At . the time Stephen was murdered he was doing A-levels at Blackheath . Bluecoat School, where he was popular, gregarious, confident. He was . never known to have caused a fight. Rio Ferdinand, later to become a . Manchester United and England soccer star, was a fellow pupil. Ferdinand . was a few years below Stephen, but Stephen, a keen Arsenal fan, knew . him through their mutual interest in football. In any case, he was the kind of . figure that new pupils would look up to. When first years arrived, it . was Stephen whom teachers chose as part of the team that showed them . around. They regarded him as a role model and knew his easy manner would . make youngsters feel at ease. He . wasn’t an angel, of course, and during his mid-teens his parents were . worried he wasn’t working hard enough. Later, he realised how important . his exams would be and got back on track. Had his path not crossed with a . group of thugs, he would have made a success of his life. ‘As a young boy Stephen was never a problem,’ his father Neville said. ‘He . had worked out what he wanted to do in life.’ He was a quick learner by . all accounts, and very talented at drawing. An architect where Stephen . did work experience offered to take him on when he passed his exams. Even . at 18 he was quite industrious – he designed and made T-shirts . featuring drawings and cartoon characters, and sold them with a friend . to shops in Camden Town. He also took a part-time job in McDonald’s. Public tribute: Flowers are laid next to the memorial plaque dedicated to Stephen Lawrence on Well Hall Road near Eltham . Like his father, who had been a . champion distance-runner, Stephen was a good athlete. He was . comparatively short at 5ft 8in but sprinted 100metres for Cambridge . Harriers and was the second fastest among his age group. The fact that . he didn’t try to flee the gang is one of the enduring mysteries of what . happened that night. Stephen’s . father, Neville, had wanted to be an architect too. But growing up in . Jamaica, he was so poor that he had to go to work at 14, and he became . an upholsterer. Hence, the family hoped Stephen would realise his father’s unfulfilled dream. At . one point Stephen, who was taken to Jamaica as a baby, even considered . going back to the Caribbean to forge a career there. Instead, the island . was to become his final resting place because his family feared his . grave would be attacked by racists if it was in England. His . mother, Doreen, told the BBC’s Panorama: ‘I am really pleased I have . buried him here, because had he been buried in the UK his grave would . have been desecrated so many times. ‘Here . nobody knows where he is. Then again, I don’t think the country . deserves to have his body there anyway because they took his life. ‘I . think it’s still the best thing we did, that we brought him here so he . can be next to his great-grandmother so she can look after him.’",Doreen Lawrence says she believes her son's grave would be desecrated if it was in UK .

Anger: The hotel in Inverness has come under fire for refusing to serve Mr Forbes the dish he ordered . The page - on which the hotel was branded 'disgusting', 'shocking' and 'disgraceful' for refusing to serve Mr Forbes the meal he wanted - appears to have been taken down. The firm's regional manager Indranil Banerjee issued an apology via the hotel's own Facebook page for the upset caused to Mr Forbes and his family, but insisted staff had not discriminated against him because of his disability.

Miss Cumming said the trio went into the restaurant at the Royal Highland Hotel for a meal, but were told Mr Forbes could not have the fish fingers from the children's menu because it was only for those aged under 12. 'I tried to explain he had Down’s Syndrome and had special dietary requirements,' she said. 'He . can’t eat big portions, only little portions. The waitress went and got . a supervisor but he was like, ""No, you can’t have that"". We just got up . and left.' Miss Cumming said they ate next door at the Filling Station restaurant, where staff 'couldn't have been nicer'. 'We got the kids' menu and everything,' she said.

'I would like to reassure all of our guests that we pride ourselves in providing equal opportunities to our diners. 'I truly regret the distress that Willie and his family have experienced,' he said. He said the family was offered a . choice of meals from the adult section of the menu - which included fish . goujons that would have been provided in a smaller serving.

With pained expressions on their faces, these brave runners take on the world's toughest foot race. In searing 130F heat, they run 135 miles through three mountain ranges in some of the harshest terrain on the planet. The Badwater Ultramarathon started yesterday, with competitors racing from Death Valley to Mount Whitney in California. Hard: Competitors run in the Badwater Ultramarathon in Death Valley National Park, California, which is billed as the world's toughest foot race . Exhausting: The terrain makes the race extremely difficult for the runners, with miles of road visible ahead of the competitors . Red hot: With long, flat, open roads, there is nowhere for these runners to escape from the scorching conditions . Hot: Oswaldo Lopez, 41, from Mexico is doused with water as he races from Death Valley to Mount Whitney, California . Runners battle through the sweltering conditions, on long roads which stretch out for miles ahead. Competitors often pass signs which read 'Caution! Extreme heat danger'. Many runners, who travel to the event from all over the world, try to lighten the strain by dressing in fancy dress. Cooling down: Oswaldo Lopez of Mexico, 41, centre, is doused with water during the 135-mile race . Tired: Keith Straw, 58, wears a tutu as he competes during the marathon. His face shows the strain of the event . Painful: These two competitors look in agony as they battle to complete the race . Brave: Chris Moon, 51, from Britain, and Shannon Farar-Griefer, 52, of Hidden Hills, California, battle the conditions . Disabled Mr Moon wears a prosthetic leg . The Badwater Ultramarathon is not for the faint-hearted. Competitors train all year around for the event, knowing that they will running in some of the planet's toughest conditions. To deal with the searing 55C heat, racers often prepare by sitting in saunas for up to an hour. This helps acclimatise the body to the extreme desert heat which they will experience during the race. With no shade along the route, runners cover themselves with long sleeved shirts and sun hats. However, one of the most important thing for racers to protect themselves against is dehydration. Every few miles, racers take on water from the support teams. They often weigh themselves throughout the race to judge how much water they have lost while racing. One man was pictured at the event yesterday dressed in a tutu while another could be seen in a funny hat and shorts. However, the clothing worn by the . runners show just how careful they have to be, with sun stroke and dehydration a very real possibility.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 10:11 EST, 15 September 2011 . A student has revealed how her life has been made a living hell after she started self-harming - in her sleep. Stephanie Walker, 20, developed the condition at the end of last year. She continued to self-harm on a regular basis since then despite efforts made by her parents to protect her. Doctors are baffled by her bizarre behaviour and she continues to self-harm up to five nights-a-week. Stephanie Walker from Leeds said her bizarre behaviour began last year . She . has become so desperate to stop the night attacks Stephanie takes . anti-depressants and sleeping pills before she goes to bed. Stephanie, . who lives with her mother Lynn, 50, father Peter, 52, and brother Michael 21, . in Leeds, has never harmed herself while awake. Stephanie, a performing arts student, said: 'I'd always been a happy-go-lucky girl.' But one night the student said she woke up to find she had been self-harming. 'I was terrified and it triggered a wave of attacks. 'I went to the doctors where I was prescribed anti-depressants. It seemed odd - I wasn't depressed at all - but the medication worked and the harming stopped. 'But then, a few weeks later, my boyfriend, who had just proposed, told me he wanted to split up. 'I was devastated and the self-harming started again. I'd sleep-walk and self-harm every night.' Dr Dev Banerjee, one of the UK's leading sleep physicians from Spire Parkway Hospital in Birmingham, said Stephanie's case was ""uncommon"". He said: 'Sleepwalkers tend to undertake non-intelligent behaviour, such as simple walking, opening closing doors or even eating. 'Some receive injuries by falling down stairs, punching walls or bumping into things. 'However, it is uncommon to systematically self-harm, which makes this particular case quite unusual. 'It is very odd for someone to take a knife and meticulously cut themselves. 'Naturally if there is a strong history of sleepwalking as a child, then it is very possible that this person may be sleepwalking. 'However, other factors need to be taken into consideration such as depression and whether the self-harm is purposeful and intentional. But people do all sorts of strange things in their sleep. 'I once knew someone who always ate just one scoop of ice-cream when they slept and another who continually sparked up lighters.' Her mother Lynn, a cleaner and father Peter, a bus driver, have tried to make the house as safe as possible for her but the behaviour still continues. Stephanie sees a counsellor twice a week and next month will visit a sleep clinic in a bid to discover the cause of her nightly attacks. Mother Lynn said: 'It is very worrying. Stephanie is a happy and bubbly person in the day but at night something takes over her. 'We hope her seeing a counsellor and going to the sleep clinic we will get to the root cause of her sleep disorder. 'Sometimes I get up in the night to check she's still in bed.' Stephanie, who has been forced to take a year off college to cope with her self-harming, added: 'It is so scary. 'I just want to get back to normal.' Stephanie hopes to get back to studying for a BTEC qualification in Performing Arts later this month.",Stephanie self-harms up to five times a week despite taking anti-depressants .

A mother was horrified after police refused to arrest a drunk driver accused of smashing into her car while she attended a children’s party. Nicola McCormack watched on in shock as the man crashed into both sides of her car before stumbling into the pub next door to carry on drinking. But she was even more livid when police failed to respond to the incident even though they’ve launched a campaign to stop drink drivers. Shocked: Nicola McCormack, pictured, watched on in horror as the drunk man hit her car on both sides, before returning into the pub . Ms McCormack, 30, from Canvey Island, Essex was at a party for around 40 youngsters at Cheeky Monkey’s play centre on the seafront when the driver smashed into her car. The man, thought to be in his 50s, then stunned onlookers by staggering from his vehicle into the Monico Pub next door to continue drinking. Ms McCormack contacted the police after confronting the man in the pub who confessed to smashing her car and told them he was drunk. But she was left gobsmacked when officers told her they could not attend because no one had been hurt, leaving the man free to get back in his car and drive off. She said: 'The police say they are trying to cut down drink driving but then they just let one get away. It is absolutely disgusting. They should’ve come out he was so dangerous in that condition being behind the wheel. 'He could barely speak he was so drunk and just reeked of alcohol. He tried to park on one side of me and crashed into my car, tried to park on the other side and crashed into my car again and then crashed into some wheelie bins. It was just lucky that car park wasn’t filled with all the kids at the time. 'He went into the pub and had some more drinks and then drove off. 'If he had killed someone that would have been entirely the police’s fault for failing to respond. He was putting the public at serious risk.' Concern: Police and Crime Commissioner Nick Alston said he understood Ms McCormack's concerns and frustrations with the police and said he would be following it up with the Essex force . Essex Police has launched its summer drink-driving campaign to crackdown on reckless motorists who get behind the wheel after boozing. The annual campaign encourages residents to dial 999 if they know of someone driving while under the influence. Police and crime commissioner Nick Alston, said: 'It is very important that everyone reports crime to Essex Police. 'Drink driving, if proven by a proper investigation, is a crime. 'My understanding is that Essex Police is actively following up on the information provided to them about this particular incident. 'It is important that the force does so, and I would also expect officers to ensure that anybody reporting suspicious behaviour of this kind is kept informed of the progress of the subsequent investigation.' 'I entirely understand the concern and frustration of the person who reported this serious incident, and I will be asking the Chief Constable for more details about this matter.' A spokeswoman for Essex Police said: 'The incidents relating to a road traffic collision and suspected drunk driver were recorded, the appropriate circulations to units across the district and reporting advice provided.' She added: 'However there were competing priority incidents at this time where offenders were arrested and as such units were committed. 'This was unfortunately a contributing factor to a lower level of service provided in this instance than we would expect. 'The road collision enquiries will be progressed in accordance with Essex Police procedures and a review of the service provided has been undertaken to ensure improved future performance.' Essex Police carried out its summer drink-drive campaign throughout last month. The campaign asked residents to do their bit in supporting police by stopping family and friends from getting behind the wheel if they’ve had a drink, calling 999 if they know someone is drunk and getting behind the wheel and reporting anyone who is known to be a regular drink-driver. During the month-long initiative traffic cops breathalysed 2,616 with 94 people found to be over the legal limit or refusing to provide a sample.","Nicola McCormack claimed her car was smashed on both sides by a self-confessed drunk, on the seafront of Canvey Island, in Essex .

Four of the jurors in the George Zimmerman trial have banded together to separate themselves from on of the other women who helped acquit the neighborhood watchman for the killing of Trayvon Martin. The group released a joint statement after one of the other jurors, identified only as B37, spoke to CNN about their closed-door sessions after the trial. 'The opinions of Juror B37, expressed on the Anderson Cooper show were her own, and not in any way representative of the jurors listed below,' they said in the statement released Tuesday night. In an effort to maintain their privacy, the four women identified themselves only as B51, B76, E6 and E40. One juror- B29- did not sign the document. Inside the courtroom: The unidentified juror said that she felt Zimmerman was justified in killing Trayvon Martin because he felt threatened, even though she admits Zimmerman may have 'enhanced' the story . 'Serving on this jury has been a highly emotional and physically draining experience for each of us,' the statement read. THE ONE WHO SPOKE OUTB-37 is a white woman who is married to an attorney and has two adult children. She said she and her husband used to have concealed weapons permits.THE ONES WHO STEPPED AWAYB-51 is retired, unmarried and doesn’t have kids. She has lived in Seminole County for nine years working in real estate. B-76 is a white woman who has lived in central Florida for 18 years. She manages rental properties with her husband of 30 years. During jury selection, she said she had been the victim of a nonviolent crime. 'Everyone deserves a fair trial,' she said.E-6 is a white woman who is married and has two children. She has worked in financial services and has lived in Seminole County for two years. During jury selection, she said she didn’t know the facts of the case well.E-40 is a white woman who works as a safety officer and recently moved to Seminole County from Iowa. During jury selection, she said she had been the victim of a nonviolent crime.THE ONE REMAININGB-29 recently moved to central Florida from Chicago. She enjoys watching the 'Real Housewives' on television and hadn’t paid much attention to the shooting. A prosecutor described her as 'black or Hispanic' during jury selection. 'The death of a teenager weighed heavily on our hearts but in the end we did what the law required us to do.' Even though they stepped away from juror B37's claims, all six of the women had to agree on the not guilty verdict before it was announced on Saturday night. One of her most controversial claims in the Anderson Cooper interview was that Martin 'played a huge role in his death'. 'When George confronted him he could have walked away and gone home,' the woman, identified only as Juror B37, said in the second portion of her post-trial interview. While she was apologetic to the teenager's family, she seemed more sympathetic to Zimmerman's position in the midst of the fight, as opposed to Martin's own self defense. 'I have no doubt that George feared for his life,' she said to CNN's Anderson Cooper. 'I'm 101% that he should have done . what he did except for the things that he did before,' she said, . referencing Zimmerman's decision to follow the teenager in his car and, . fatefully, get out of the car and confront him. 'When the end came to the end, he was justified in shooting Trayvon Martin. 'He . started the ball rolling, he could have avoided the whole situation by . staying in the car, but he wanted to do good- he had good in his heart, . he just went overboard.' While . Zimmerman himself never took the stand in his own defense, video . recordings of him explaining the situation to police after the fatal . shooting were submitted, effectively giving him the chance to tell his . side without leaving himself open to a cross examination. Cleared: The juror said that she felt that Zimmerman went above the bounds of what he should have done but 'his heart was in the right place' Their side: Gladys and Robert Zimmerman spoke out for the first time in an interview taped on Monday, saying that they fear for their son's life . That was no matter for the juror: I'm . sure there were some fabrications, enhancements, but I think pretty much . it happened how he said it happened.' Initially . this unidentified female juror was planning on writing a book about her . experience on the trial- and even had a literary agent lined up early . Monday afternoon- but after the first portion of her interview was aired . that evening she and the agent decided not to follow up. The second portion of B37's interview was . aired on Tuesday, and she went into more detail about how two specific . tact used by the prosecution may have influenced the outcome. Breaking out in riots: Protests throughout the country, including in Los Angeles (pictured Monday) Mayhem: A group of protestors try to tear down a fence in Los Angeles where the demonstrations turned violent on Monday night and many were arrested . Throughout her interview with Cooper, . the woman regularly referred to the neighborhood watchman as George, and . though she did call the 17-year-old Trayvon, she admitted that she felt . more personally connected to Zimmerman as opposed to Martin. 'Trayvon wasn’t as well known to us because there wasn't as much said about him,' she said. Cooper . brought up the fact that the two legal teams took very different visual . approaches when making their closing arguments, with the defense . holding up a concrete block like a portion of the sidewalk to show what . they contend Martin used to attack. On the opposite end, the prosecution . held up the Arizona Iced Tea bottle and a bag of Skittles, saying that . was the only thing he was armed with. 'The Skittles and the Arizona can were ridiculous to even compare it to,' she said. Martin's materials: Assistant state attorney Bernie de la Rionda held up the Skittles and Iced Tea that Trayvon had on him at the time of his death, saying that was all he was armed with . Hard hitting: By contrast, defense attorney Mark O'Mara held up a piece of the concrete sidewalk that he argued Martin used to bash Zimmerman's head . 'I believe he hit his head on the concrete, I believe he was trying to slam it...it was definitely enough to make you fear . 'I hope (Zimmerman's) family can live a normal life after a while. I don't know how he's ever going to do that.' Yesterday . it was revealed that the first vote that the six-woman jury took behind . closed doors came as a draw, with three wanting to acquit, one ready to . charge him with second degree murder and two for manslaughter. In . today's segment, she made it clear that after hours of discussing the . case and the evidence, the group had shifted to be five in favor of . acquittal with one hold out. 'I wanted to find him guilty of not using his senses...you can't charge him with anything because he didn't do anything unlawful,' she said. Juror B37 went on to sob while saying that she wanted to apologize to the Martin family for the tragedy that they had to go through, but she also had a message for George Zimmerman and his family- after it was revealed yesterday that his parents have been in hiding as well as the former neighborhood watchman and his wife. 'I hope his family can live a normal life after a while. I don't know how hes ever going to do that. He'll never forget but I hope he can,' she said. Her interview aired just minutes before four of the remaining five jurors put out a statement saying that they want to remain anonymous and are formally requesting privacy.","One of the six jurors, identified only as B37, spoke out about the verdict .

Devastating effect: Mrs Garcia went from being a healthy mother-of-four to losing all her hair and fighting depression within seven months . The part-time civil process worker from Victoria, Texas, gave away most of her belongings, arranged for hospice carers to come to her home and drew up a 'bucket list' convinced that she was about to die.

Mrs Garcia was misdiagnosed in 2009 when Dr Qadri removed a benign tumour from her left breast. But it wasn't until she went to another doctor because she was suffering anxiety that she was offered a small amount of hope when a series of scans cast doubt on her original diagnosis. Further tests at a specialist cancer centre in Houston, Texas, revealed that she never had cancer and a subsequent investigation showed that Dr Qadri had misread lab results. Dr Qadri has since died. Although Mrs Garcia said that she was relieved when she found out that she didn't have terminal cancer, she said that she was angry that such a mistake was made in the first place.

Export bar: The work, known as 'Rembrandt Laughing', is said to be a striking example of the Dutch artist's early paintings . An export bar has been placed on a Rembrandt painting in an effort to allow time to raise £16.5million to keep it within Britain. The work, known as ‘Rembrandt Laughing’, is said to be a striking example of the Dutch artist's early paintings and was one of only a few which he executed on copper plates. The painting was bought at an auction in May by the Getty Museum of Los Angeles, California. Culture Minister Ed Vaizey deferred the grant of an export licence for the painting until at least October 15 to allow a chance for the money to be raised. The Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art and Objects of Cultural Interest advised the deferral because it was of outstanding aesthetic importance and of significance for the study of Dutch painting, particularly Rembrandt's work in the 1620s. The picture - known as a ‘tronie’ - may have been a self-portrait but was painted in 1628 to depict an emotion rather than to be a likeness of a particular person. Most of Rembrandt's paintings in UK collections date to after 1631. Mr Vaizey said: ‘The UK's galleries may already have an impressive array of Rembrandts, but nothing from this period of this great artist's career. Hopes: Culture Minister Ed Vaizey deferred the grant of an export licence for the painting until at least October 15 to allow a chance for the money to be raised .

The painting was valued at £1,500 in 2007 . because it was not believed to be a Rembrandt original, but later sold . for £2.2million. It was said at the time that the painting was worth up to £20million. Rembrandt van Rijn is considered to be one of the greatest painters in European art.

Many people are waiting to find out what Kate and William's baby will be called before naming their own . The birth of the most eagerly anticipated baby of the decade is just days away and the world is waiting with baited breath. But while the royal baby is yet to be born - let alone named - he or she is already influencing baby name choices on a wider scale as  traditionally royal monikers see a rise in popularity. A new survey reveals that 22 per cent of expectant parents are taking inspiration from the excitement of the impending royal babies and are strongly considering naming their child after Royals from over the years, with Harry and Sophie topping the list as the two of the most popular names. The study asked over 2,000 expectant parents-to-be whether or not they had planned a name with any kind of Royal connotation for their unborn child, to which just over a fifth of the parents taking part said they had. These respondents were then asked to state what these Royal names were, revealing the top five most popular Royal names amongst expectant parents for their unborn children as Harry, William and Charles for boys and Sophie, Kate and Elizabeth for little girls. Respondents were asked if they believe . that the recent buzz surrounding the upcoming royal births sparked their . desire to want a more traditional first or middle name for their child. Eighty two per cent agreed with this statement. 82 per cent of people surveyed said that the buzz around the Royal births had a huge effect on their baby name choices . George Charles of VoucherCodesPro.co.uk, who carried out the research, said: 'I must say, the result of this study . really surprised us, especially with the . recent trend of celebrities favouring more obscure names for their . children such as Blue Ivy, Apple, Harper Seven, Suri and North. 'It seems . that this celebrity obscurity doesn’t hold as much sway nowadays, and we . Britons are looking to keep things traditional and follow in Royal . footsteps! Harry and William topped the poll for most popular baby boy's names, with 22 per cent and 16 per cent of the votes respectively . The favourite girls' names were Sophie, a nod to the Countess of Wessex, and Kate - after the nation's favourite duchess . 'I don’t mean to sound like too much of a .

'We certainly can’t wait to see what . both impending royal babies will be named - and it will definitely be . interesting to see if the chosen names make expectant parents change . their minds.' Another recent survey found a record numbers of newborn babies are expected to go unnamed this month as parents across the country wait to discover the name chosen by the royal couple. Parents are given six weeks to register their baby's name and that means thousands are expected to pause for thought until they hear the news from Clarence House. Experts believe that thousands of couples are likely to find inspiration in the choice of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and follow suit. Netvouchercodes.co.uk found more than ten per cent  of respondents in their survey of expectant mothers said they were hoping to postpone having to name their offspring until they heard the royal name.

Britain was once famed around the world for being home to a nation of gentle, mild-mannered folk who minded their Ps and Qs. But instead of using the age old phrase 'thank you' to show our appreciation, we are now more likely to say ‘cheers’, ‘ta’ or ‘that’s great’. A new study has found terms such as ‘cool’, ‘brilliant’, ‘lovely’ and even ‘boom’ have firmly rooted themselves in our vernacular. Boom! Like Ali G, Britons have abandoned the well-worn phrase thank you in favour of less formal terms . Other common ways of offering thanks include ‘you star’, ‘super’, ‘wicked’ and ‘okay’. Researchers found four in 10 people . prefer not to say 'thank you' because the phrase is too formal, while 13 . per cent deem it ‘old fashioned’. Of the 2,000 Brits who took part in the study, which was commissioned by banking firm First Direct to launch its new 'Big Thank You' campaign, 83 per cent thought more effort . needed to be made to regularly show gratitude. An alarming six in 10 respondents believed Britain was now 'quite rude'. And while more than half felt appreciated by their partners, only five per cent felt loved by their bosses. 1.       Cheers2.       Ta3.       That’s great4.       Okay5.       Cool6.       Brilliant7.       Lovely8.       Nice one9.       Much appreciated10.     You star11.     Sorted12.     Fab13.     Alright14.     Awesome15.     Merci16.     Gracias17.     Super18.     Wicked19.     Boom!20.     Danke . But despite the apparent shift in our national psyche, two thirds of people still like to regularly appreciate others in everyday conversation, just not necessarily in the most traditional way. First Direct's head of customer communications Zoe Shore said: 'The key thing to remember is that people still like to give and receive thanks, but in the modern world there are a million different ways to do this. 'You’ll probably find that people use different phrases to thank others, depending on what situation they are in and who they are speaking to. 'So words such as boom, cool and wicked might be deemed appropriate with your mates, but not quite so suitable for a work setting, or when talking to an elder. 'But being told you are appreciated, no matter how this is expressed - through words, cards, letters or otherwise - is a great feeling.' The study shows eight in 10 people believe others should always be thanked for kind actions, with 25 per cent saying it doesn’t matter if it’s just a little wave of acknowledgement. But a third of those polled admitted they probably could do with showing their appreciation a little more, such as buying someone flowers, sending a card, or sending a gift. We say thank you to shop workers (33 per cent) more than our parents (26 per cent) or teachers (four per cent). Brits will most commonly thank someone when given change, when receiving a present or if someone buys them a drink. Shop assistants are among the people we thank the most . Other actions which usually result in some form of thank you include someone holding the door open, someone telling you that you look great, or when someone saves a space for you. But when on the receiving end of thanks, 64 per cent say that just hearing those special words - or something similar - makes them feel that everything was worth the effort. Ms Shore added: 'Thanking people is something we’re big on. 'Showing appreciation is a two way thing. Our consistently great customer service means we get thanked regularly, and we also want to say a big thanks to all our customers for banking with us. 'We all show appreciation in different ways - as long as it means something to the person on the receiving end and makes them feel good, that’s all that matters.'","Shop workers top the list of people we are prepared to thank .

A teenager who fell 40ft from a hotel balcony only survived after landing on a car - just days after a British mother of two fell to her death at the same resort. Mikey Hill, 19, slipped and fell after partying with friends in the Mediterranean party resort of San Antonio in the early hours of Friday morning. The teenager, of Wigton, Cumbria, was rushed to hospital and spent 24 hours in intensive care after suffering two punctured lungs, extensive bruising and a dislocated hip after his fall from the Hotel Brisa. Doctors expect him to spend at least three weeks in hospital, but insisted that he is lucky to be alive and was only saved by the car. Mother Susan, 51, said: 'He can't remember how it happened, but doctors said that it was his landing on the parked car that saved his life. 'If he had landed on the concrete, it would have been a different story. I've told him he's one lucky boy.' As millions of jetsetting Brits travel abroad for sun-filled partying, the number of summer tragedies has rocketed in recent years. Mikey's mother said he had been very much looking forward to what was his first lads' holiday with a group of his friends. They arrived at the San Antonio resort on Thursday, and celebrated the start of their holiday by going out together. His fall happened at the end of the night out.

'You hear about these things but never expect them to happen to your family. We're still in shock. 'Mikey was in intensive care for 24 hours, and I think they operated on him. He seems fine now. 'His lungs have got a drain in them to . get all the fluid out. I've spoken to him on the phone and he says he . can't remember anything.

The 66-year-old grandfather was stabbed to death on Saturday afternoon after he went to the aid of an elderly neighbour who was being robbed at his home in the village of Little Gaddesden in Hertfordshire. Earlier today police arrested McLoughlin at a house in Tottenham, north London, on suspicion of robbery and murder. He was taken back to Hertfordshire for questioning about the killing of Mr Buck. This evening police confirmed three more people have been arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender. They are a 54-year-old man from Tottenham, a 45-year-old woman from Edmonton and a 50-year-old man from Hackney.

Not good enough: Chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee said the number revealed that only one per cent of illegal immigration reports result in someone being removed . Only one in every hundred reports of an illegal immigrant results in someone being forcibly removed from Britain, the Home Office has admitted. The figures are laid bare by a new hotline which was set up last year for members of the public to report suspected illegal immigrants. Between September 2012 and June this year, there were 48,660 calls to the Home Office’s Allegations Management System (AMS). Of these, 2,695 led to a visit by an immigration enforcement officer. Those visits resulted in 1,840 arrests and 660 eventual deportations. This means just over one per cent of all reports actually result in a suspected illegal immigrant being removed. The disappointing ratio was revealed by MP Keith Vaz, chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, as the group of MPs heard evidence from the new head of immigrations enforcement Dave Wood yesterday afternoon. Mr Vaz told him: 'It does not seem like a big hit rate to me.' But Mr Wood defended the figures and argued that allegations often do not provide enough intelligence for the authorities to act on. He said: 'The intelligence we get from the allegations often do not provide information likely to lead to an arrest. 'Sometimes it is actionable.' Questions: The new head of immigration enforcement Dave Wood defended the ratio of allegations to deportations . In March the Home Secretary Theresa May abolished the UK Border Agency and split it into two bodies - UK Visas and Immigration and an Immigration Enforcement command, which are now under the control of ministers. Mr Wood is the new head of Immigration Enforcement. Mrs May also gave evidence to the committee in which she acknowledged that the lengthy appeals process used by illegal immigrants to stay in the country must change. 'We need to look at the number of appeals people are able to go through,' she said. Mrs May said the forthcoming Immigration Bill will close down the number of avenues of appeal open to illegal immigrants and result in people being deported more quickly. 'I think members of the public get very upset when they see people going from appeal to appeal trying one route then another. I think we do need to look at that system,' she added.

Eight members of a drug-trafficking gang which flooded the north of England with £25million worth of cocaine have been jailed for a total of 121 years. The men adopted code names inspired by Stanley Kubrick’s cult war film Full Metal Jacket to smuggle drugs from Mexico into Yorkshire. Senior gang member Paul Robinson was . known as 'Colonel' in recognition of his role, while accomplice Frank . Babar used the pseudonym 'G-man' and 45-year-old Richard Stead was . nicknamed 'Ten Seconds'. Nicknames: Richard Stead, left, known as Ten Seconds - a reference to the film Full Metal Jacket - was jailed for 21 years for conspiracy to supply drugs, Brent Padgett, right, was jailed for 16 years . The gang renamed Sheffield 'Saigon', . Manchester was 'Hollywood', and Sheffield's Ecclesall Road - where the . gang met to discuss deals and pick up deliveries of cocaine - was dubbed . 'The Strip'. Prosecutor David Brooke told a six-week trial at Sheffield Crown Court: 'They’ve been both clever and incredibly stupid to use these nicknames as they gave police a very good idea of the part each member played.' Detectives used surveillance, . bugging devices and intelligence to foil the activities of the gang, . which was turning over between £400,000 and £500,000 every month at its . height. The men imported up . to 200kg of cocaine from Mexico over a period of two years, concealed . in the hydraulic arms of scissor lifts. Full Metal Jacket: Michael Dyson, left, 41, was jailed for 18 years after admitting conspiracy to import and supply drugs, and Joseph Fawcett, right, 26, was jailed for 12 years after admitting conspiracy to supply . Police discovered parts for several lifts at an industrial unit in Battersea, London, and another unit at the Wharncliffe Business Park in Barnsley, where they also found a dust mask contaminated with cocaine. The gang was captured after South Yorkshire Police launched a huge investigation in August 2011 involving several other forces, the Serious and Organised Crime Agency and foreign law enforcement agencies. They tailed suspect Carl Carlton in his car to a layby in Rawmarsh, near Rotherham, where he picked up half a kilo of cocaine with a street value of £40,000. After Carlton was arrested police seized his phones and began tracing the rest of the gang, who were dealing in 80 per cent pure cocaine. The pair involved in the exchange were acting for Stead and Robinson. Code names and pseudonyms: The gang referred to Sheffield's Ecclesall Road - where they would meet to discuss drug deals - as 'The Strip' The real deal: The actual Strip, in gamblers' paradise Las Vegas, is slightly more glamorous than the gang's South Yorkshire meeting spot . Several members of the gang lived . luxury lifestyles, the court heard. One defendant, Michael Dyson, had to . be repatriated from the Netherlands for the trial. Stead . brought kilos of cocaine, MCat and Class B drugs into South Yorkshire. He was secretly taped talking about selling drugs and the cost of . barrels of cutting agents used to dilute cocaine. Stead, of Wilthorpe, Barnsley was found guilty after trial of conspiracy to supply cocaine and MCat and was jailed for 21 years. Seven other gang members were also sent to prison. 'Stupid': Police said the gang had been 'incredibly stupid' to use nicknames inspired by the film, as they gave detectives an indication of the role played by each member . Michael Dyson, 41, of the Netherlands and Paul Robinson, 35, of Shafton, Barnsley were each jailed for 18 years after admitting conspiracy to import and supply cocaine and other drugs. Brent Padgett, 30, of Barnburgh, Doncaster admitted conspiracy to supply cocaine and other drugs and was jailed for 16 years. Four other men were jailed for 12 years each after admitting conspiracy to supply cocaine and other drugs. They were: Tristan Clarke, 28, of Sheffield, Joseph Fawcett, 26, of Sheffield, Anthony Urban, 35, of High Wycombe and Frazer Guest, 35, of Chesterfield. Babar, 48, of Richmond, London will be sentenced later after being convicted of conspiracy to import cocaine and concealing criminal property. The court heard he bought a tennis equipment company from ex-Wimbledon champion Pat Cash and a Dragon’s Den entrepreneur Richard Farleigh whom he knew through playing chess. He denied it was a front for his criminal activities. Another defendant, Marco Russo, 41, of Streatham, London was cleared of conspiracy to import cocaine.

A toddler has died after falling four storeys from a block of flats when she climbed out through a window. Muna Mohamed, who was just 18 months old and had just learned to walk, is believed to have fallen from the kitchen of her home after climbing onto a breakfast bar. Neighbours today described the moment the young girl fell to her death from her window. Neighbours described hearing the Muna's mother Layla scream before she ran down the stairs to find her daughter where she had landed on the gravel. Tragedy: The little girl, named by neighbours as 18-month-old Muna, fell to her death from an open window at her family's fourth floor flat in Bristol . Paramedics . fought to save Muna outside the council-owned block in Windmill Hill, . where she lived with her mother, her father Abdirasaq, and her . five-year-old brother Mohamed, but she later died at Bristol Children's . Hospital. Her parents, who are Muslim, are believed to . have been up before sunrise to eat breakfast before observing the . Ramadan fast when the tragedy unfolded early on Monday morning. The family's neighbour Abdul Elmi, . 39, said Muna, who was just learning to walk, had climbed onto a . chair then on to the table before falling out the window. Mr . Elmi, who lives on the sixth floor and was friendly with the family, . who hail from the same part of North Somalia, said: 'They were a nice . family and from the same tribe as us - called Issaq. 'My wife goes to speak to the mum of the family a lot. 'The little girl was a cute little girl and a pudgy little thing who was always by her mother's side. 'My wife heard they were sleeping and . the little girl, she always stays with her mum, but this time she is . starting to learn how to move around and she climbed up a little chair . and table by the window and fell out. 'They are Muslims it is Ramadan. I . don't know what they were doing some people get up and have breakfast . and then go back to bed, but some people don't. It is very sad. 'I'm very frightened for my family now - that could have been one of my daughters,' Mr Elmi said. Sorrow: Flowers and cuddly toys were tied to the railings outside the flats in Windmill Hill in the wake of the child's tragic death . Shock: It is thought the little girl's family were up early on Monday to eat breakfast before sunrise ahead of observing the Ramadan fast . His wife Ayan, 29, said she often visited Muna's mother with her daughters, aged nine, five and four, and three-year-old son. She said: 'When we looked out the window and saw there was a lot going on I had no idea that it was my friend's little girl. 'I went down to knock on the door and there were a lot of police around. 'Muna was a beautiful little girl - very lovely. 'She would always sit next to her mum - she was very content. We are sad about what happened.' Another neighbour, Paul Sheppard, 40, said: 'It’s so sad - a big shock. Everyone in the flats is cut up about it. She was a lovely little girl. 'On Monday morning I heard her mum scream, then she ran out to get downstairs as fast as she could. The police were round here straight away.' Shock: Horrified neighbours living in the building told of their fears for their own children . Sarah O’Driscoll, 28, who lives on the floor below with her seven-year-old son Mitchell, said: 'It’s really scary. 'Having kids, it makes you realise living in flats like this you need to watch them all the time. 'I mean it has been so hot that everyone has had there windows open, you just would never think that kind of thing would happen. 'My son’s seven now, and even though he’s a bit older it still scares and panics me when I can’t see him. 'On the morning it happened I could see the police and paramedics outside but I didn’t know what was going on at first. It’s so tragic. 'I put a teddy out at the tributes because we are all one community here. We are all the same block so it just makes you think. It has been so quiet here since. I think everyone is in shock. 'A member of the family told my sister that the parents, obviously, are in shock. He said the parents took it really bad. It is just so sad.' In mourning: Paramedics fought to save the toddler but she later died at Bristol Children's Hospital . An Eeyore teddy was tied to the railings near where Muna fell, as well as a rabbit teddy with the words 'bless you my little one' scrawled on the label. Another card taped to flowers said: 'To a little angel who was taken young and suddenly, may you rest in peace.' Another said: 'My heart goes out to the family on the tragic loss of their little girl. RIP little angel.' A South Western Ambulance Service spokeswoman confirmed they were called at 6.54am to reports that a young girl had fallen from a balcony. She was conscious and breathing at one point but had suffered serious head injuries and was taken to Bristol Children’s Hospital. Avon and Somerset police spokesman Wayne Baker said the girl died later in the day and because investigations found no suspicious circumstances, the case has been referred to the Avon Coroner. The coroner’s office confirmed that a file on the death had been referred to them, but said that an inquest had not yet been opened.","Girl, 18 months, died after falling from open window of fourth floor flat .

Labour today called for a Downing Street inquiry into the influence of lobbyist Lynton Crosby over government moves to abandon plans for plain cigarette packaging. Ed Miliband accused David Cameron of ‘caving in to big tobacco’ after it emerged Tory election guru Mr Crosby also advises tobacco giant Philip Morris. Pressure has mounted on the Prime Minister since Mr Crosby was hired by the Conservatives to spearhead his bid for re-election in 2015. Row: Prime Minister David Cameron faced repeated questions in the Commons about the business interests of his election campaign chief Lynton Crosby (right) The row dominated Prime Minister’s Questions after the coalition shelved plans to follow Australia in forcing tobacco firms to sell cigarettes in plain packets. Asked if he had discussed plain cigarette packaging with Mr Crosby, whose clients include tobacco giant Philip Morris, Mr Cameron said: ‘He has never lobbied me on anything.’ But Mr Miliband accused him of using ‘weasel words’ and added: ‘He can't deny that he had a conversation with Lynton Crosby about this issue. Even by the standards of this Prime Minister this is a disgraceful episode.’ The Labour party is writing to Labour to Downing Street to demand an inquiry into whether Mr Cameron has breached the ministers' code of conduct. The code states that ministers ‘must ensure that no conflict arises, or could reasonably be perceived to arise, between their public duties and their private interests, financial or otherwise’. The row overshadowed the publication of legislation which would force lobbyists to publicly state who their clients are. Labour . also found itself embroiled in the tobacco lobbying scandal after it . emerged James Barge, a former aide to Mr Miliband, left the party to . join Philip Morris International as a Corporate Affairs Manager. Tory MP Julian Smith today wrote to Mr Miliband to ask if he had ever been lobbied by Mr Barge. 'Clearly it is important to ensure that politicians act with the utmost transparency when it comes to lobbying,' Mr Smith said. In the Commons Mr Miliband told Mr Cameron: 'You are the Prime Minister for Benson and Hedgefunds and you know it. 'Can't you see that there is a devastating conflict of interest between having your key adviser raking it in from big tobacco and then advising you not to go ahead with plain packaging?’ Devastating: Labour leader Ed Miliband said there was a clear conflict of interest between Mr Crosby's work as an adviser to tobacco firms and the government's decision to shelve plain cigarette packets . But Mr Cameron said if Mr Miliband wanted a ‘lobbying scandal’ he should look at his own party: ‘The trade unions buy his policies, buy his candidates, they even bought and paid for his leadership.’ He added: ‘This Government is doing something that they never did for 13 years and that is publishing a lobbying Bill. ‘Let us remember why we need a lobbying Bill: we had former Labour ministers who described themselves as cabs for hire, we had cabinet ministers giving passports for favours, we had a prime minister questioned by the police under cash for honours. ‘They are in no position to lecture anyone on standards in public life.’ Under Whitehall rules it is for the Prime Minister himself - in consultation with his senior civil servant, Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood - to decide whether any alleged breaches require investigation by his independent adviser on ministers' interest. It is also for the PM himself to decide what action should be taken over any breach of the code. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt last night insisted there was a ‘clear dividing line’ preventing Mr Crosby lobbying on public health issues. He told BBC 2's Newsnight: ‘He hasn't lobbied me and he hasn't lobbied the Prime Minister on issues to do with public health and there's a clear dividing line. But there's also transparency, we're not hiding this fact.’ Asked if public health was a whole area Mr Crosby was not allowed to touch, he replied: ‘Yes’.

A Downing Street source refused to answer questions about whether Mr Cameron had conversations with Mr Crosby over cigarette packaging. The source said only: ‘Lynton Crosby's firm advises the Conservative Party on strategy, not ministers on Government policy.’ And Mr Crosby himself declined to answer the same question, telling the BBC: ‘The Prime Minister's said everything that needs to be said on that issue.’ But Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps was more forthright in denying that there had been any conversation. When asked on BBC Radio 4's World At One ‘Did Lynton Crosby have any conversations with ministers about the strategy on packaging for cigarettes?’, Mr Shapps replied simply: ‘No.’","Prime Minister faces questions about influence of Lynton Crosby on policy .

In another worrying find in the wake of . the horsemeat scandal, only one restaurant, Jamie's Italian, could . reliably tell secret diners where their meat had come from. Study: The table was based on nutritional standards, sourcing policies, children's facilities and the experience of 40 mystery diners . Jamie Oliver, who launched Jamie’s .

'Over the years, I’ve learnt that if . you give kids a bit of ownership over their food, they’ll really embrace . it, so that's exactly what we’ve done with our “shake me” salads.

Top rated: A survey based on the experiences of 40 families rated Jamie's Italian, pictured, as the best for children's food . Burger King, which admitted that some of its burgers contained contaminated meat earlier this year, came bottom of the list. A spokesman said: 'At Burger King UK .

Two Beatles tribute bands are involved in a heated court battle over whether one of the musicals about the Fab Four has copied the other. The fight is between the producers of two shows: Let It Be, which is about to open in Broadway after a successful London run, and Rain, the first and longest-running Beatles show that played on Broadway in 2010 and 2011. The creators of Rain are suing their rivals for copyright infringement, and seeking half of their revenue from the show because they claim it uses many of the same songs and has 'similar or identical' artwork. The cast of Let It Be, the Beatles tribute show whose producers are being sued by another musical, Rain . The Rain tribute show is the longest-running and most successful of the musicals devoted to the Fab Four . They also want Rain Corporation to be listed as a joint author of Let It Be, saying that their team had huge involvement in the newer show, advising on script, costume and even wigs. Among the elements of their show that the Rain camp say are copied in Let It Be are musical arrangements (28 of the 31 songs in Rain are in Let It Be), the floppy haircuts, and the between-songs Liverpudlian banter. The lawyer for the Let It Be producers Jeff Parry and Annerin Productions, Peter S Cane, said any show about the same band was working from the same source material. He told the New York Times: 'How do you monopolise the abiltiy to present an impersonation of The Beatles? 'How many different ways can you really do it?  The Beatles acted a certain way, they played certain notes, they spoke a certain way.' A lawyer for the Rain Corporation did not comment but referred back to the legal complaint, which says both camps agreed to work on a joint production in 2005, which became Rain. The real deal: The Beatles, who disbanded in 1970, at the 1967 launch of their Sgt Pepper album . The lawsuit says that Mr Parry wanted to stage a London version of the show, which ultimately became Let It Be, but then sent an email saying the 50/50 agreement was no longer valid and that the Rain producers would receive instead just 7.125 per cent of the revenue. The Rain Corporation is now saying it is entitled to half of the proceeds from Let It Be when it opens in New York next week.","Court battle between producers of rival stage musicals Rain and Let It Be .

A market stall owner has been convicted for selling so-called ‘legal highs’ in the first case of its kind in the country. Hamayan Parwani, 37, was found guilty of selling an intoxicating substance to a person under the age of 18. Leeds Magistrates’ Court heard how a member of staff at Parwani’s stall in Kirkgate Market, Leeds, sold a synthetic form of cannabis to a 16-year-old boy. Landmark: Parwani was prosecuted for selling a form of synthetic cannabis, similar to the one pictured, to a 16-year-old boy . Police officers were keeping the business under observation and arrested Parwani as part of an operation by West Yorkshire Police, focusing on premises which had been given earlier warnings about selling to youths. Stall worker Kebba Kujabi was seen selling the substance to the youngster and admitted the offence when he appeared at court in April. Kujabi was handed a conditional discharge for the offence. Parwani, who was present at the time of the sale, pleaded not guilty on the basis that he himself did not sell the item to the boy. During his trial, the prosecution successfully argued that as Kubjabi’s employer, Parwani was legally responsible in the course of his employment. Parwani, of Old Farm Cross, West Park, Leeds, was sentenced to a 12-month conditional discharge. Danger: Police are warning young people that synthetic substitutes for drugs such as cannabis, cocaine and ecstasy are still harmful . The pair were charged under Section 1 of the Intoxicating Substances (Supply) Act 1985, which was originally brought in to target the selling of solvents. West Yorkshire Police said they used the legislation to target 'legal highs' and hope other forces may follow suit. The drug the teenager was sold wasn't classified at the time of the offence but has since been made illegal. The case comes as part of an ongoing campaign to target the psychoactive substances - which are manufactured as chemical substitutes for illegal drugs  such as cannabis, cocaine and ecstasy - and to raise awareness of the health risks associated with them. Chief Superintendent Paul Money, Commander of City & Holbeck Division, said: 'This is a landmark conviction which represents a real step forward in our ongoing campaign to target the trade in these substances. 'We remain very concerned that so-called ‘legal highs’ are being sold openly in the city and that this makes some people, particularly the young, feel they can take them without risk. 'Just because they can be bought legally, it doesn’t mean they are safe for people to take. 'Experts tell us that most of these synthetic compounds have no real research or testing behind them and are put together in laboratories abroad with the main aim being to circumvent existing drugs legislation and maximise their profits. 'There have been a number of cases both locally and nationally where these substances have been linked to deaths and people being taken to hospital seriously ill. 'We are determined to do all we can to limit the potential risk they present to people. 'The people who trade in these circumstances operate on the margins of legality'","Hamayan Parwani, 37, sold intoxicating substance from his stall in Leeds .

Pope Francis will offer plenary indulgences to participants of World Youth Day - even it is only over the internet . The Pope will offer forgiveness to Catholics who follow services on World Youth Day - even if it is only through Twitter. The Vatican announced Pope Francis will offer plenary indulgences to participants in the festival - his first foreign trip as Pontiff - in Rio de Janeiro this month. Pilgrims travelling to the Brazilian city will be granted indulgences, but in an unusual step, the Argentine Pope has extended the offer to people who participate in the event by watching it on television, listening over the radio or following it on the internet. Plenary indulgences offer a full pardon of the temporal punishment (a punishment due to be suffered either in this life or the next) for sins that have already been forgiven in confession. The church teaches indulgences can reduce time spent in purgatory. Cardinal Manuel Monteiro de Castro, head of the . Vatican office that deals with indulgences, released a decree saying Catholics across the world can receive a partial indulgence if they pray with the Pope for young Catholics. About 2million pilgrims, including hundreds of thousands of young Catholics, are expected to flock to Rio for the event. To receive indulgences from abroad, Catholics must participate in the service 'under the usual spiritual, sacramental and prayer conditions, in a spirit of filial submission to the Roman Pontiff'. They must  participate 'in the sacred functions on . the days indicated, following the same rites and spiritual exercises as . they occur via television or radio or, with due devotion, via the new . means of social communication,' Catholic News Agency reported. Speaking to Vatican Radio, Monsignor John Kennedy, an official at the Congregation of the . Faith said: 'The word indulgence is not very . familiar to many people today, especially to the younger generation. Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims are expected to flock to Rio for World Youth Day. Pictured: Youths carry the event cross as it arrives at Rio's city hall . 'In fact, you might be surprised to know that the Christian . meaning of the word indulgence really comes from Latin ""indulgentia"" and . it means kindness or tenderness, and refers, in this context to God’s . kindness in forgiving the effects of sins. '[Indulgences] are linked to a theme that Pope Francis has . spoken very frequently about since the moment of his election – that is . to say, to the gift of God’s mercy. The huge festival will be held from July 23 to 28. Pope Francis will greet tens of thousands of pilgrims on Copacabana beach on July 25 and during the five days he will be guarded by 600 military personnel. He will also hear the confessions of some of the young Catholics at Rio's Quinta da Boa Vista Park.

Police have found ‘no evidence whatsoever’ that undercover officers were tasked with smearing the family of Stephen Lawrence, a chief constable said yesterday. And the man who made the smear claim has so far refused to speak to the team investigating his allegations. Mick Creedon, who is leading an inquiry into the activities of Scotland Yard’s now-defunct Special Demonstration Squad, told MPs he has not seen anything to back up the dirty tricks allegations. He was responding to allegations last . month from Peter Francis. The former undercover officer alleges that in . the aftermath of Stephen’s murder he was ordered to find ‘dirt’ for use . against members of his family. Mr . Francis, 47, said he was also asked to target Stephen’s friend Duwayne . Brooks, who witnessed the 1993 murder in Eltham, south-east London, and . other campaigners furious at the failure to bring the killers to . justice. Yesterday it . emerged that Mr Francis, who suffered a mental breakdown before leaving . the Met in 2001, has so far refused to speak to Derbyshire Police chief .

Speaking . at a meeting of the Commons home affairs committee, Mr Creedon admitted . his 20-month inquiry – codenamed Operation Herne – had uncovered . references to relatives of the murdered teenager among the files of . Scotland Yard’s undercover units. But he said this was purely because officers were targeting protest groups that they feared could spark violence. Asked if there was evidence of a smear campaign, Mr Creedon replied: ‘No, none. There is limited reporting within our incident room that relates to Stephen Lawrence’s murder, including references to Stephen’s parents Doreen and Neville. ‘There is no evidence whatsoever. We are really keen to speak to officers deployed at that time, including Peter Francis.’ Target? Duwayne Brooks, a friend of Stephen's who witnessed his murder, was among those allegedly targeted by undercover officers who were trying to get 'dirt' on those involved in the campaign for justice . Mr Creedon said he was keen to meet Mr and Mrs Lawrence and hoped to be able to reassure them about his work. He said a public inquiry, which has been called for by the family, may not be the best way to get to the truth. He added: ‘I may be naïve but I hope to explain how we can investigate this and build trust.’ It is understood that Mr Creedon’s team is examining previously archived Special Branch documents and files relating to the Lawrence case in an attempt to establish the truth about Mr Francis’s allegations.

She is the same as everybody . else apart from the fact she doesn’t feel right in her own body. ‘She would rather play with a doll . than a car. She is a girlie girl. She wants all the latest fashions. There is nothing about her which is male. ‘It wasn’t a problem until she got to . primary school at the age of seven-and-a-half. Then she would have to . lie about what she got for Christmas and say a football or an Action Man . when in fact she got a pair of sparkly shoes and a Barbie. Everything . she was having to do was a lie.’ People with gender dysphoria, which is also known as gender identity disorder and transgenderism, experience anxiety and discomfort about the gender they were born with. It is rare, but the number of those  diagnosed is increasing due to growing public awareness. Symptoms can begin at a very young  age. Children may refuse to wear the clothes typically worn by those of their gender, or may dislike taking part in the usual games and activities. While the cause of gender dysphoria is unknown, it is classed as a psychiatric  condition. Research into its causes is  ongoing, with recent studies suggesting it has much to do with biological development. Treatment is varied and aims to help people become content with their gender identity. Some choose to dress and live as their preferred gender, while others take hormones that change their physical appearance. Most transsexuals – those who have  long-lasting and extreme gender dysphoria – seek to have surgery to permanently alter their sex. In 2009, a German teenager became the youngest person to undergo Gender Reassignment Surgery for the condition – at the age of 16. Kim Petras – born Tim - started hormone replacement therapy as part of her gender transition at age 12. She added that her son had known he wanted to be a girl since he was two-and-a-half but was forced to act like a boy at school. He would then act and dress like a . girl when he got home but became a target for abuse as more and more . people realised his secret. His mother added: ‘We went to a . performance at the school and my daughter (the boy) went as herself. Some of the parents were unhappy she was allowed to go into the school. 'They were walking past, coughing and . saying: “That’s that freak family. That’s that freak child”. It’s not a . phase. It’s not a choice – what child would choose to be completely . miserable? ‘I don’t expect people to understand. I just don’t want people abusing my child. I don’t want her to be . called a freak. I want her to be left alone. Some people need glasses. Some people are required to go in wheelchairs. My daughter needs to . dress like a girl because she is a girl.’ The mother added that the school had been very understanding, as had many of her son’s classmates. But some parents said they should have been consulted before an announcement was made to the pupils on their first day back. One parent with a child at the school . said: ‘The headteacher told all the kids that there was a kid at the . school who was a girl trapped in a boy’s body. The parents we spoke to are . absolutely outraged that they weren’t consulted about this. This kid is . just going to be bullied now. Why didn’t the school send us a letter?’ The school head said: ‘We operate an inclusive policy and work hard to ensure all our pupils have the support they need. ‘As part of this, we feel it is . important to encourage discussion and promote understanding. We strive . to make sure that all our children get the most possible out of their . time here and a key part of this is helping pupils understand that all . their peers are unique.’ According to the NHS, an estimated . one in 4,000 people is receiving medical help for gender dysphoria. On . average, men are five times more likely to be diagnosed with the . condition than women.","Boy had to lie about Christmas presents and pretend he was given Action Man figures instead of Barbie dolls .

Two thieves who stole a 'priceless' artwork by the sculptor Henry Moore and sold it at a scrapyard for £46 have each been jailed for a year. Liam Hughes, 22, and 19-year-old Jason Parker stole the Working Model for Sundial - believed to be worth around half a million pounds - from the grounds of the Henry Moore Foundation in Hertfordshire. The pair returned to the artist's former home four days later and tore another sculpture, known as Upright Motive Number 7, from its bronze plinth before making off with the base, which was valued at £100,000. They sold it as scrap for £182.60. 'Selfish': Jason Parker, 19, and Liam Hughes, 22, both from Essex, admitted stealing a Henry Moore sculpture worth around £500,000 and selling it at a scrapyard for £46 . Henry Moore is widely regarded as one of the most important British artists of the 20th Century, and his creations have fetched millions at auction. Neither of the men had any idea of the true value of what they had taken, St Albans Crown Court heard. Sentencing the pair today, Judge . Marie Catterson said: 'The value of Sundial is put at something like . half a million pounds, but the truth is it is actually priceless because . it cannot be replaced should it be lost. 'These . actions were utterly selfish thefts. You were stealing these items for a . pittance as scrap regardless of any damage or impact your actions might . have on others. 'You took . the risk of causing immense damage to the Henry Moore Foundation and you . were risking the permanent destruction of the items that, certainly in . the case of Sundial, are irreplaceable works of art,' the judge added. Stolen: Parker and Hughes took Sundial from the grounds of Henry Moore's former home in Hertfordshire . When the scrapdealer who had . unwittingly bought the items saw an appeal for their safe return on the . television programme Crimewatch, he contacted police and returned both . pieces before they were destroyed. Parker and Hughes, both from . Coltsfield in Stansted, Essex, pleaded guilty last month to stealing the . 22-inch tall Sundial piece overnight on July 10. They also admitted . returning to steal the plinth from another piece between July 15 and 16. 'Irreplaceable': The artist Henry Moore, who died in 1986, pictured with Sundial . The cost of repairing the damage to the artwork the pair tore from the bronze plinth, together with other necessary security works, is estimated at £13,000, the court heard. John Carmichael, prosecuting, added that the thefts had damaged the Henry Moore Foundation's standing in the international art world. 'Perhaps of more significance to the members of the Foundation is that sculptures had to be taken from public view, taken from access,' he said. 'The Foundation is concerned that this weakens its position in the international market. 'If the reputation is that they cannot look after their own works, why would it be safe for them to look after other works. 'Henry Moore is an artist who stipulated that no further works should be made from the casts of his works, so if they disappear and are melted down, that is it,' he added. Carlo Coccaro, in mitigation for Hughes, said the 22 year old 'wishes to apologise' for the thefts. He said: 'They decided to take the metal from that location because they had been told it was a target for theft. It was never their intention to take it for its artistic value. Charles Snelling, in mitigation for Parker, said his client was 'drifting into delinquency' and had been hit hard by his girlfriend’s miscarriage, which happened shortly before the theft. Parker and Hughes were each given a 12 month jail term, which Parker will serve in a young offenders' institution.","Liam Hughes, 22, and Jason Parker, 19, stole the Working Model for Sundial from the artist's former home in July .

The five-year-old victim, Radhika Devi, was found with multiple injuries on July 8, near a highway in Lucknow, the capital city of Uttar Pradesh, northern India. But a postmortem examination report – demanded my family members – concluded she was viciously raped and stabbed before she died of shock and blood loss. Justice: Rape and murder of a five-year-old girl in Lucknow, northern India is latest to expose police negligence when investigating such cases.

Further protests led by poet Sankha Ghosh hit the streets of Kolkata in June to campaign against the gang-rape and murder of a college student in Kamduni village . Senior superintendent of Lucknow Police, Ravinder Goud, said: ‘We have suspended two officers for negligence and formed a special team to investigate the rape and murder of the girl. 'We are yet to find the murderers but we're working on some leads and expect a breakthrough soon.’ The little girl was from a nomadic community. She lived with her mother, Geeta Devi, 34, and two siblings after her father died three years ago. Her mother works selling grinding stones on the highway. Geeta had reported her daughter missing to Gomtinagar Police Station when she couldn’t find her anywhere near her home on the night of July 8. Four hours later passers-by found the little girl's dead body 500 meters away from her slum home with a pack of stray dogs nearby. Local police concluded the girl had come out of her home to go to the toilet and was subsequently attacked by dogs and dragged 500 meters away, towards the highway. But the family was not satisfied and was determined for the girl’s death to be investigated thoroughly. The family claimed the police officers tried to dissuade them from ordering a post-mortem examination, which later confirmed she was brutally raped and murdered. The report found she had 80 stab wounds, 72 of those near her genitals and eight deep wounds on her upper body. Ashamed: An anti-rape protest in Gauhati, India, last December.

'Critical but stable': Nelson Mandela, who was hospitalized on June 8, remains in critical but stable condition, according to the office of President Jacob Zuma . A lawyer acting for the family of Nelson Mandela is facing disciplinary action for allegedly overstating the seriousness of the former freedom fighter's health to fast track a court hearing. David Smith, acting for Mr Mandela's oldest daughter Makaziwe, his wife Graca Machel and ex-wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, told a closed court that the former statesman is in a 'permanent vegetative state' and said doctors had recommended his life-support be switched off. It moved a judge to bring . forward a hearing into whether the bodies of three of Mandela's children . should be exhumed and reburied at a family grave two years after they were removed to a different site by his grandson Mandla. While he made the claim on June 26, it . was only leaked to the media last week, sending shockwaves across the world and prompting an old friend of . Mandela, Denis Goldberg, to speak out saying he had visited him and that he 'responds . to voices and tried to speak'. Now Mandla claims he was given no . notice of the court hearing because of the request for urgency and was . therefore unable to attend to defend his position, the Daily Telegraph reported. He says he plans to file a complaint against David Smith and is even considering bringing a case of perjury against Winnie Madikizela-Mandela for allowing the 'exaggeration' in court. 'My client is deeply upset,' said his lawyer Gary Jensen. 'He respects the wishes . of his grandfather and he didn't want this private family issue to be aired . so publicly in a court but the applicant chose that route and won their case . through devious means.' Nelson Mandela is expected to share the new grave with his children when he passes away. The news comes as Mandela completed one month in hospital with a lung infection. As he lay in his hospital bed, well-wishers from around South Africa visited his home to lay cards and flowers at a shrine that has appeared there in recent days.

Older people with Alzheimer's disease are less likely to develop cancer, and those with cancer are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s, scientists have discovered. A study of more than 200,000 people - the largest of its kind - showed the risk of an Alzheimer’s patient developing cancer was half that of an elderly person without the condition. They also found that having cancer made a person 35 per cent less likely to develop Alzheimer’s. Older people with Alzheimer's disease are less likely to develop cancer, and those with cancer are less likely to develop Alzheimer's . It's hoped discovering the links between the two conditions could lead to better understanding of both. The researchers also hope it could open the door to the development of new therapies. Dr Massimo Musicco said: ‘Since the number of cases of both Alzheimer's disease and cancer increase exponentially as people age, understanding the mechanisms behind this relationship may help us better develop new treatments for both diseases.’ His researchers looked at 204,468 Italians over 60 during a six-year period during which time 21,451 developed cancer and 2,832 Alzheimer's. A total of 161 had both diseases whereas that number would have been expected to be 281 for cancer and 246 for Alzheimer's when considering how often they occur in the general population. Dr Musicco, of the National Research Council of Italy in Milan, said: ‘While other studies have noted this relationship before, this is the largest study to date. The risk of an Alzheimer's patient developing cancer is half that of an elderly person without the condition . ‘It has several strengths over previous studies, such as looking for the presence of the second disease both before and after the first disease was diagnosed. ‘This controls for the possibility the presence of one disease might obscure the diagnosis of other diseases because any new symptoms might be interpreted as a consequence of the already-diagnosed disease, or in the case of cancer, people might assume memory problems were a side-effect of chemotherapy.’ The researchers found the same result in people who died during the course of the study as well as those still living - controlling for the possibility the reduced life expectancy for the first disease would also reduce the likelihood of living to develop the second.","People with cancer 35% less likely to get Alzheimer's .

A man who brutally attacked a would-be burglar leaving him with a broken back has been jailed for four years. Arthur Wilkinson and an accomplice beat Stephen Pugh when they discovered him and two other men trying to steal quad bikes from the defendant's compound in Horden, near Peterlee, east Durham, in January. Wilkinson’s barrister told the court that the defendant had been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder at the time, and how one of the men had pushed him to the ground. Wilkinson, 52, drove wounded Mr Pugh . to the University Hospital of North Durham in Durham with serious . injuries, with the defendant claiming that he had found him in that . condition. The 34-year-old . suffered a broken back bone, a double fracture to his leg, a smashed . nose, a fractured left arm and bruising all over his body. The court heard how Mr Pugh was hit with a wooden bat as well as being kicked and punched. Wilkinson, of Peterlee, denied causing grievous bodily harm with intent, but admitted it after a trial began in September. Robert Adams, prosecuting, told Teesside Crown Court another man had been questioned about his involvement in the brutal attack but no charges were ever made against the man who was named by Wilkinson. Mr Pugh has needed 13 operations since the attack at a yard owned by Wilkinson. In mitigation, Stephen Constantine said a psychiatric report showed that Wilkinson was suffering from post traumatic stress disorder after suffering a violent attack in 2007 which led to him having flashbacks. Mr Constantine told the court how Wilkinson had been pushed to the ground by one of the three men he discovered trying to steal two quad bikes from his compound. Wilkinson, 52, drove seriously injured Mr Pugh to the University Hospital of North Durham . He said: 'This man was in a vulnerable position, physically and mentally, and that had a significant bearing on the way he then reacted.' Judge George Moorhouse sentenced . Wilkinson for four years after taking into consideration his guilty plea . and the contents of his psychiatric report. Mr Pugh was caught trying to steal a quad bike (file photo) He . said: 'You entered a yard where you work to find three men in the . process of burgling your premises, that was a very traumatic experience . for you as evidenced by the psychiatric report. 'It . does seem that the other man involved was the one using the baton and . was most likely to have caused the most extensive injuries. 'Having said that it was a joint enterprise and you must accept responsibility for your part in it.' Mr Pugh is not facing any charges in relation to the case. The . case follows that of Daniel Mansell, 33, and Joshua O'Gorman, 27, who . sentenced to four years in prison following a masked raid on the cottage . in Welby, near Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire. Their victims, Andy and Tracey Ferrie, were arrested after Mr Ferrie opened fire on the pair during the midnight break-in. The . homeowners were held on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm and . spent 40 hours in custody before prosecutors decided they had acted in . ‘reasonable self-defence’ and lifted the threat of charges. Cannabis addict Mansell was shot in the right hand while O’Gorman was shot in the face during the incident in September. At the sentencing in September, Judge Judge Michael Pert QC said burglars who break into country homes can expect to be shot at by their victims. He spoke out after a lawyer demanded leniency for a career criminal who he claimed had been blasted with a shotgun in 'a form of summary justice'. The judge replied: 'If you burgle a house in the country where the householder owns a legally held shotgun, that is the chance you take. You cannot come to court and ask for a lighter sentence because of it.' The case reignited the debate over the rights of homeowners to defend their properties from intruders.","Defendant and accomplice discovered three men trying to steal quad bikes from his compound .

A fit and healthy young man died at the age of 21 because of an undiagnosed and deadly heart condition. Callum Branche, a carer, had a ‘work hard, play hard’ attitude and enjoyed regular games of football with his friends. But he enjoyed life and his work not realising he had the potentially fatal heart condition coronary artery anomalies. The condition means that blood is fed into the heart from the body’s main artery, the aorta, from only one side. Callum Branche, 21, died from a rare and undiagnosed heart condition which meant that blood was only fed to his heart from one side of his aorta . It can be aggravated by exercise as a problem artery can be squashed or kinked under the pressure of more blood being pumped to the heart. Mr Branche, from Little Lever, near Bolton, Greater Manchester, was found dead at his family home by his parents Timothy and Lindsay in April. An inquest was told six foot three inch Mr Branche - described by his family as a ‘gentle giant with an infectious grin’ - had no history of poor health. He was said to be ‘very family-orientated’ and ‘didn’t have a vicious bone in his body’. His father told the hearing: ‘He wasn’t shy of work. He worked hard and played hard. He was very active with how he lived his life.’ His father said: ‘He had his . breakfast then went back to his bed. He came back downstairs and spoke . to us, he was his normal self. ‘There was absolutely nothing to indicate there was a problem at all. He was just his normal self.’ However, . when his parents returned from a shopping trip later that day they . found their son’s lifeless body slumped against a door. Mr Branche, who worked as a carer, was not aware that he had the condition and had no history of ill health . His father desperately attempted to revive him before paramedics arrived, but his son was pronounced dead a short time later. Pathologist Dr Emil Salmo said Mr Branche’s death would have been very sudden and unexpected. He said he died from natural causes, the sudden death being down to an anomaly of the right coronary artery from the left coronary sinuses. He added: ‘It is a condition that would not normally have any symptoms.’ Mr Walsh strongly advised the couple to encourage their two other sons, aged 24 and 26, to go for a medical check-up. Returning a verdict of death by natural causes he added: ‘Callum was a young man who lived life to the full to work hard and play hard - exactly how you would want to have a son. ‘It is devastating for you to go out shopping and you come home to find him collapsed. I am so dreadfully sorry, I cannot imagine what it would be like, it is devastating.’ Mr Branche was found dead at home by his parents, Timothy and Lindsay Branche, when they returned from a shopping trip. Images shows the heart and circulatory system . In a statement Callum’s family said: ‘He would put his big arm around you. He was just a lovely lad. ‘He loved his mum to bits. He loved his job. He loved caring for people and talking to the residents. He was such a caring person and all the patients loved him.’ A spokesman for the charity Cardiac Risk in the Young said: ‘In 1 in 100 people both coronary arteries come from the same side of the aorta. This is called an “anomalous coronary origin” or “coronary artery anomaly”. ‘The unusual origin of the artery means that the artery must take a different route to supply the heart muscle. In the majority of people this causes no problems. ‘However, in a small number, the abnormal route can cause the anomalous coronary artery to be squashed or kinked during exercise. ‘If the blood supply to the heart is disturbed then it can cause chest pains or dangerous arrhythmias. The cause of coronary artery anomalies is not known. However, in most cases they do not appear to be inherited.’","Callum Branche had a heart condition called coronary artery anomalies which meant blood was only fed to his heart from one side of his aorta .

A grieving father has been banned from the GP surgery he has attended for more than 60 years after raising concerns about GPs who failed to spot his son’s deadly brain tumour. Last week Malcolm Buckley, 62, spoke of his devastation that his son, Chris, 34, died of a brain tumour after being told his symptoms were caused by depression. He has now been left stunned after receiving a letter informing him he has a week to find a new doctor as his name is to be removed from the register at Robert Frew Medical Centre in Wickford, Essex. Malcolm Buckley has been banned from the Robert Frew Medical Centre after going public about his concerns that his son could have received better treatment if he had not been repeatedly misdiagnosed . The shock move came just days after Mr Buckley raised concerns about three of doctors at the surgery who treated his son. Mr Buckley said: ‘I’m convinced this is the direct result of me raising concerns about my son’s care in the local paper and the doctors clearly do not like any criticism. ‘People should be aware that if they complain about their GP, they could be struck off. ‘I have been at the surgery 62 years with no previous issues and could now struggle to find another practice.’ Mr Buckley claims he was given no warning of the removal - a move required by British Medical Association guidelines - and was handed ‘veiled threats’ about going to the press with his concerns. The senior councillor at Basildon Borough Council was shocked when he received the letter which stated: ‘Robert Frew Medical Centre has asked contractor services to remove your name from its list of NHS patients. ‘If you are not accepted by another . doctor then your name will be removed from your present doctor’s list on . July 16 when his responsibility for your treatment will cease.’ Mr Buckley’s son had seen three doctors . at the surgery over a year who prescribed him with anti-depressants and . sleeping tablets to deal with his developing symptoms. Chris Buckley, 34, died of a brain tumour in May after being told repeatedly that he was suffering from depression . It was not until Mr Buckley’s son lost the use of his hand that the tumour, which was the size of a tennis ball, was discovered following a trip to Basildon Hospital A&E. Despite a four-hour emergency operation to remove the bulk of the tumour, he died on May 2 this year. Taylor Wood Solicitors, speaking on behalf of Robert Frew Medical Centre, said: ‘The practice has removed Mr Buckley from its list because the doctor-patient relationship, based on trust and mutual respect, has broken down irretrievably. ‘The partners respected Mr Buckley’s right to complain - indeed we have continued to offer GP medical services throughout the complaints procedure. ‘Mr Buckley has articulated in no uncertain terms that he has no confidence in three doctors in the partnership. ‘The partners are on call in rotation and there may well be a situation when the only doctors available will be one or more of the three concerned. ‘Under these circumstances the . practice believes it is in Mr Buckley’s best interest and that of the . partnership that he register with another practice.’ Mr . Buckley’s son went to Robert Frew Surgery in Wickford, Essex, in . December 2011 because he was struggling to talk and could not remember . some words. Taylor Wood Solicitors, speaking on behalf of the surgery, said: 'The practice has removed Mr Buckley from its list because the doctor-patient relationship, based on trust and mutual respect, has broken down irretrievably' He visited the surgery with girlfriend Kelly McCain who had to speak for him because his speech had got so bad and was prescribed with antidepressant citalopram and sleeping tablets. His condition worsened over the New Year and he saw another doctor who prescribed more antidepressants. But by the end of January Mr Buckley was barely able to speak and he was referred to a mental health unit at Basildon Hospital. But when he got to the mental health unit, staff were unable to understand him and he left. When father and late mother, Sylvia Buckley, 59, noticed that he could not use his right hand they were told by NHS Direct to take him to A&E where the tumour was discovered. He was transferred to Queen's Hospital, Romford, where drugs improved his speech but two months later his situation deteriorated rapidly and he died. Malcolm Buckley believes his son may have received better treatment sooner if he had been properly assessed and diagnosed. A practice spokesman speaking on behalf of Robert Frew Surgery said: 'Even though Mr Buckley has spoken publicly, we are unable to discuss confidential details of patient care. 'The GMC conducted a thorough investigation and made no recommendations for action. We offer our sincere condolences to the family.'","Malcolm Buckley has been banned from Robert Frew Medical Centre .

"PUBLISHED: . 22:40 EST, 15 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:50 EST, 16 July 2013 . The death of a Utah teenager is proving to be a mystery to investigators who discovered his body early on Saturday morning. The body of Nathan Tyler Haun, 17, from Spanish Fork was spotted by a driver around 5:30 a.m. lying in the middle of the road, on a lonely stretch of rural highway known as the Arrowhead Trail between Salem and Payson. Police have said they're about to make arrests in the case. Dead: The body of Nathan Tyler Haun, 17, from Spanish Fork, Utah was found in the middle of a rural road in the early hours of Saturday morning . Seargent Spencer Cannon with the Utah County Sheriff’s Department said Haun’s body was badly bruised. Detectives believe Haun may have fallen out of a fast moving car. 'There was a significant amount of trauma that was very extensive from head to toe,' Cannon said. 'There was no chance of survival.' Haun was at a house party on Friday night in Payson just hours before he died. According to investigators, a group of teens who were at the party are staying quiet, possibly because there was underage drinking. Cannon said the teenagers and their parents are not talking and have hired attorneys, which makes Haun’s death look suspicious. Suspicious: Investigators believe Nathan Huan either fell out of a vehicle, but aren't sure if he was inside, on top or was possibly pushed out. Evidence was spread over a 100-foot area . 'They’re not only not cooperating with us, they’re being very uncooperative, so what we’re really not getting the detail we need from the people we think know what happened,' he said. Nathan's father has come forward to say that he believes his son was killed on purpose. Preston Haun told RadarOnline that he does not believe his son’s death was from a random hit-and-run accident and that he believes he knows who is responsible. 'I honestly believe that he was run over by someone at the party,' Preston told RadarOnline on Monday when reached via phone. 'I believe he was run over on purpose. There were no skid marks.  It was like he was hit and they kept on going.' Preston said that the circumstances of his child’s death are suspicious. 'Even if it was an accident, nothing matches up.' Isolated: Nathan's body was found on this lonely deserted stretch of Utah highway. His father, Preston, believes he knows who is responsible and that arrests are just days away . He said that he has heard that his son was 'talking to a girl and maybe there was an argument with people he didn’t know, or people he had only known for a few hours.' Preston told Radar that he believes kids that know about Nathan’s death are not coming forward. Word of Haun’s death is spreading quietly through the community. People who wished to remain anonymous brought flowers to the site where Haun died. 'He was just always friendly,' a woman said. 'He was a good kid.' Police say Nathan Haun got into an argument with another teenager over a girl at the party, but they have ruled out that teen’s involvement in Haun’s death. They hope anyone who has information will have a change of heart and come forward. Rumors have been rampant online, with one friend writing an accusatory note about Nathan’s death . 'How sick are you? To kill someone over something soooo stupid as that. You’re a low person. I hope you burn in hell,' the person wrote. 'It’s a horrible way to die, but yet to be abandoned by people who would supposedly have been loyal to him is difficult,' Cannon added. 'The family is having a hard time with that. In reality we’re not worried about kids having a couple of drinks. We’re worried about what happened to this poor kid.'","Nathan Tyler Haun's body was found lying in the middle of road .

"By . Steve Doughty, Social Affairs Correspondent . PUBLISHED: . 17:30 EST, 11 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:49 EST, 12 July 2013 . Growing numbers of unmarried women in their 20s and 30s who live with their partners do not feel financially secure to have a baby . Half of all abortions are now carried out on unmarried women who are living with a partner, official figures revealed yesterday. The share of terminations performed on cohabitees has trebled in a decade. Last year cohabiting women had 86,764 abortions – 50 per cent of all abortions among women who were willing to give details of their relationships. There were almost two abortions performed on cohabitees for every one undergone by a lone single woman, and three for every one for a married woman. The fast rise in abortion among women in live-in relationships appears partly to result from financial pressure on couples in their 20s and 30s during the recession, who find themselves expecting a baby but can’t afford one. Another factor could be women in co-habiting relationships fearing they could end up being left to bring up a baby on their own if their partner leaves them. The figures may also in part reflect a willingness on the part of women to be open about their living arrangements, when in the past cohabitees having abortions would be more reluctant to admit they had a partner. The number of women living in cohabiting relationships has doubled since 1996, according to estimates by the Office for National Statistics. Around 1.5million women were cohabiting in the mid-1990s. This rose to two million by 2000, 2.5million in 2006, and just under three million now. This landmark in the use of abortion comes at a time when research suggests a typical cohabitation lasts for just three years before it breaks up or the couple marry. Research shows that the number of live-in relationships last three years before the couple either break up or marry . By contrast the average divorce comes after 11 years of marriage and an average marriage lasts for 32 years. In 2002 only 17 per cent of women who had an abortion in England and Wales said they had a partner but were unmarried. This . went up to 31 per cent in 2005 and then to 42 per cent in 2007 and 2008 . as the recession began to bite. The proportion of cohabitees who had . terminations was 49 per cent in 2011, and hit the 50 per cent benchmark . last year. Overall the . number of abortions in England and Wales dropped slightly in 2012 to . 185,122, compared with 189,931 the previous year. The total number of abortions in England and Wales has dropped in the last year . Alongside . the 86,764 performed on unmarried women with partners, 44,923 were . performed on  lone single women, 28,828 on married women, and 10,387 on . unmarried women who would not describe their relationships. Alarmingly, the figures found there were 89 girls under 16 who had a second abortion, including one who went through her fourth termination. The only age group among whom abortion numbers rose was women between 30 and 34, up from 29,579 in 2011 to 30,353 last year. Pro-marriage pressure groups blamed the insecurity of cohabitation for pushing women towards abortion. Harry Benson, of the Marriage Foundation, said: ‘This is what happens when large numbers of couples move in together and become trapped in unhappy cohabiting relationships. ‘The commitment of a couple who decide to marry and build a future is similar to the commitment involved in planning a baby. Cohabiting couples rarely have that commitment.’ A spokesman for the Department of Health said: ‘We are pleased to see that the number of abortions is falling but we know that more needs to be done. Abortions can be traumatic and stressful and should never be seen as a form of contraception.’","Number of abortions performed on cohabitees has trebled in a decade .

A Labrador and a golden retriever – named Kaspa and Oscar - have become the first dogs in the country to look after dementia sufferers. The pair has been drafted in to help Ken Will, 79, and Maureen Benham, 69, who were both diagnosed with dementia three years ago. As their conditions have deteriorated, their dependence on respective partners Glenys Will, 66, and Frank Benham, 74, has increased - until now. Scroll down for video . A Labrador and a golden retriever - named Kaspa and Oscar (pictured with Maureen and Frank Benham) - have become the first dogs in the country to look after dementia sufferers . Thanks to the new Dementia Dog project, Kaspa and Oscar, both aged two, can now support Mrs Benham and Mr Will by listening for a set of alarms which tell them to do specific tasks. Kaspa and Oscar - who moved into the homes in March – know to carry out certain tasks when they hear the sounds. The dogs are able to pull off a duvet to wake up the person, bark, and nudge the person. But one of the most important tasks is to respond to an alert which informs them to pick up a pouch with medication in it and take it to their owner. Mrs Will, from Arbroath, Scotland, who has been married to Mr Will for over 40 years, said: ‘The results have been unbelievable - we've got a lot more from this than we ever expected. ‘To some it might look like we've just got a new pet, but it's no word of lie to say we've got our life back now we have Kaspa. The dogs have been drafted in to help Ken Will, 79 (pictured with his wife Glenys and Kaspa), and Maureen Benham, 69, who were both diagnosed with dementia three years ago . Kaspa and Oscar know how to carry out a range of different tasks when they are alerted by the sound of an alarm. For example, they can wake up their owners by pulling the duvets off their beds . ‘We are going out so much more with the dog and meeting so many new people. We don't have to lock the door to keep Ken inside now. ‘The condition has had a big impact on our lives. Ken used to get very angry and aggressive but when he sees the dog he forgets about all his problems and has a smile on his face. ‘Kaspa is the first thing he sees in the morning and he will bring a toy to Ken straight away and it just lightens the atmosphere from the beginning. ‘Kaspa is also great with nudging Ken every now again to stop him falling asleep, so it helps him keep a lot more active and happier than he did before. One of the most important tasks the dogs carry out is to respond to an alert which informs them to pick up a pouch with medication in it and take it to their owner . After the successes of Kaspa and Oscar, another two puppies have started training to join the programme . ‘He will also bring Ken his medication whenever the alarm goes off, so it means I don't have to be there all the time to look after him. ‘People just don't understand how hard it is living with someone who has dementia. But this scheme has really worked and I hope it can be rolled out across the world. ‘Every morning I would get up and think to myself “I wonder what problems today will bring?”, but not anymore, we're so much happier.’ Mr Benham added: ‘Maureen and I can't imagine going back to what it was like before we got Oscar.’ The project was the brainchild of students at Glasgow School of Arts and was developed by Alzheimer Scotland, Dogs for the Disabled, and Guide Dogs Scotland last year.

A premature baby was found dead in his cot after becoming dangerously dehydrated because doctors allegedly failed to tell his parents how to properly tube feed him, an inquest has heard. Ben Claydon, who was born at 26 weeks with a range of health problems, had been hooked up to a feeding tube at home to receive proteins and nutrients. However, his parents claim his doctors failed to tell them that they also needed to give him water. Ben Claydon, who was born at 26 weeks with a range of health problems, died of dehydration after doctors at Southend Hospital (pictured) allegedly failed to tell his parents he needed water as well as his feeding tube . Ben was born prematurely with cerebral palsy and short bowel syndrome – a malabsorption condition. He died at the age of one. Just days before his death, he had been hit with an infection which caused him to vomit severely, meaning he lost valuable fluids. His gastric nasal feeding tube ensured he got the protein and nutrients he needed, but his parents, who live in Southend, Essex, say they had not been told they also needed to give him water. Southend coroner Yvonne Blake now plans to write to all hospitals in the area to ask for more advice and support to be given to families to ensure babies get the right amount of fluids. The inquest heard Ben’s tube had been replaced by a community nurse the day before he died in July, 2010, but no concerns were raised with mother Natasha, 29. Dr Liina Kiho, a paediatric pathologist at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital, who carried out a post-mortem on Ben, found he had extremely high levels of salt in his body because of his dehydration. She urged health workers to tell parents about the importance of giving their children water as well as their tube feed- especially if they have been unwell. She said: ‘If there is anything in a child's condition which means they are going to lose fluid, which adds to an already vulnerable baby, it should really be taken very seriously. It can be a big challenge for a family having a child with serious medical issues who required nasal gastric feeding. Ben was born prematurely with cerebral palsy and short bowel syndrome - a malabsorption condition. He died at the age of one . ‘It comes down to the fact that the child needs to be monitored by the parents regularly and they need to know how to recognise signs of fluid loss and dehydration and notice the significance of the condition.’ An inquest was originally opened 10 days after Ben’s death but adjourned so more evidence could be collected. Recording a narrative verdict for his death, coroner Yvonne Blake said: ‘Ben was a very premature baby with numerous medical problems. He became unwell through dehydration and this combined with his medical conditions contributed to his death.’ However, Southend Hospital, which treated Ben, insists appropriate procedures are in place to educate parents about fluids and feeding tubes. It claims that before children are discharged, families are given unique instructions on how to care for them to ensure nasal gastric tubes continue to work effectively at home. Southend Hospital, which treated Ben, insists appropriate procedures are in place to educate parents about fluids and feeding tubes . While fluids are needed, the amount varies for each person depending on their medical condition. Follow up home visits are carried out by community nurses working for the South Essex Partnership Trust (SEPT) but monitored closely by staff at Southend Hospital. Wendy Pearson, head of paediatrics, said: ‘All parents of children discharged with a naso-gastric tube are trained by hospital staff and sign a competency to ensure they know what to do before they go home. They are also given information from a consultant and dietician on the right types of feeds and volumes of fluid needed, as the requirements of each patient are very individual. ‘We work very closely with the community teams employed by the SEPT to support the parents of paediatric patients discharged with naso-gastric tubes, and the community team provides a 24 hour on call service available to any parent who has concerns or needs advice. ‘The community nursing team is also able to refer directly to the paediatric assessment unit here at the hospital if they have concerns that a child may be acutely unwell.’","Ben Claydon was born early with cerebral palsy and short bowel syndrome .

Penny Winton, 10, developed Transverse Myelitis (TM) two years ago leaving her paralysed from the chest down and seeing four of everything. She was told there was a 70 per cent chance she would never return to full health, but after a gruelling physiotherapy programme has made a full recovery. Penny Winton, 10, developed the neurological condition Transverse Myelitis (TM) two years ago leaving her paralysed from the chest down and seeing four of everything . Penny’s parents Lynn and Jack say that her condition began to quickly deteriorate after she was bitten by a tick while on a family holiday on the west coast of Scotland. She was diagnosed with TM which is a disorder that attacks on the central nervous system and affects just 300 people a year. Doctors said she would be fine, but in October 2011 her health worsened to the point where she couldn’t even tolerate light. Mrs Winton said: ‘Penny couldn’t go to the bathroom. She stopped being able to move her legs and she was in a lot of pain. ‘Her eyes were crossed. Everything was in four. She said, “Mummy, I don’t know which mummy is you. I can see four mummies”.’ Penny, who lives in Aberdeen, was rushed to Royal Aberdeen Children’s Hospital. At first, doctors thought she had meningitis, but after the results came back negative, Penny was sent for an MRI which confirmed she had developed TM. Penny (pictured with her mother, Lynn) was told there was only a 30 per cent chance of her making a full recovery but after months of physiotherapy she has returned to full health . Doctors treated her with high doses of steroids, but they were not sure how much damage had been done and warned her parents that she may never walk again. Her mother said: ‘We were told that a third of children with TM will make a full recovery, a third will make a partial recovery and the other third will make no recovery at all.’ TM is a rare neurological disorder which results in inflammation of the central nervous system. It can be caused by abnormal activation of the immune system against the spinal cord but it often develops alongside other infections. Symptoms depend on where the spinal cord is affected and on the severity of the damage caused to the myelin and the neurons in the spinal cord. Symptoms include muscle weakness, paralysis, fatigue, depression, fever, headache and incontinence. There are about 300 cases a year in the UK. Treatment usually involves using drugs to reduce inflammation and then physiotherapy to help with rehabilitation. Recovery can take up to two years - one third of patients make a good recovery, one third make a partial recovery and a third show no recovery at all. But Penny battled on and after months of . treatment she relearned how to sit up, before building up her strength . to take her first steps. Penny left hospital just before Christmas, but was still too weak to even carry a bowl of cereal. However, she was determined to keep fighting and wrote a list of goals, including getting dressed and tidying her own room. Seven . months on, Penny has crossed off every item on the checklist and is . able to move around like any other little girl her age. Mrs Winton said if it wasn’t for the hospital staff at the hospital, Penny wouldn’t have made it back to full health. She said: ‘Penny is living proof of what the doctors, nurses and everyone else who works in the hospital can do. ‘If it wasn’t for all the people who worked so hard for Penny, we don’t know where we’d be today. 'These people go the extra mile. ‘It’s absolutely outstanding that we have this incredible support and service on our doorstep and we will always be so grateful for what the hospital did for us. ‘We’ll never know exactly what happened, but all we do know is that we have our little girl back. ‘The medical teams did a fantastic job with Penny, along of course with her determination. They all wanted to make her better.’","Penny Winton, 10, developed Transverse Myelitis after being bitten .

He was born on January 28 this year weighing 9lb 9oz with Transposition of the Great Arteries (TGA) - a condition which means the main arteries are the wrong way around. Oscar Tasker was born with his main arteries the wrong way around and suffered a heart attack during surgery to correct the defect - this caused the left side of his heart to die . The condition, which affects one in 100 babies born in the UK, starved Oscar's body of oxygen. When he was just 15-weeks-old he underwent two emergency seven-hour operations within 24 hours at Birmingham Children's Hospital to correct his arteries. Despite having a 98 per cent success rate, his parents Lois and Jason Tasker were devastated when doctors told them the left side of his heart had died after he suffered a cardiac arrest. Surgeons advised the family to prepare for the worst and even suggested they turn off his life-support machine in order to let him ‘die with dignity’. But his parents refused and he was transferred to a specialist heart unit at Freeman Hospital in Newcastle, 200 miles from their home in Radford, Coventry. Oscar was put on a 'Berlin Heart' - a 15kg machine, which supports the work of the heart and acts as a life-saving bridging device for children awaiting a transplant. Oscar was so ill his mother, Lois, (pictured) was told not to hold him because even the slightest touch could trigger a fatal heart attack . He was put on the heart transplant list but his parents were told to expect the worst and were even advised to turn off his life support machine so that he could 'die with dignity' Incredibly, after just 100 days on the machine, doctors told Oscar's parents that his heart had made an almost full recovery and he was fit enough to come home. His thrilled mother, 28, said yesterday: ‘I was a bit sceptical at first. I didn't quite believe it and still can't get my head round it, the fact that he's much better. I can't wait to bring him home. ‘The time he had on the heart machine may have calmed his heart, that is the only explanation I can think of but I genuinely think it's a miracle. ‘All we were looking for was some improvement and hope that he can get better and thankfully that has happened. The couples' other five children (pictured from left to right: Liam, two, Milo, three, Ryan, seven, Paige, nine, Abbie, 11) were born all perfectly healthy so Oscar's health problems 'were quite a shock', according to mother Lois. His parents, Louis and Jason, refused to give up on him and he was put on a 'Berlin Heart' - a 15kg machine, which supports the work of the heart and acts as a life-saving bridging device for children awaiting a transplant . ‘The doctors made a decision and told us he was off the transplant list last Wednesday. ‘I didn't believe it, I asked them to tell me again, I questioned it at first because I did not expect to hear it, it was a huge relief. ‘When he was really poorly, we couldn't touch him or hold him, it was heart-breaking. ‘It was minimal touch, the most we could do was maybe touch his finger because his heart pressure would go up, the oxygen levels in his blood would fall, we couldn't hold him till he was 14 weeks old. ‘Touching him stressed him out too much and it could have killed him. All I wanted to do was pick him up and cuddle him but I knew I couldn't because it could kill him.’ She explained that most babies have an arterial switch operation and go home two weeks later but Oscar's coronary artery was damaged and he had a massive heart attack which killed the left side of his heart. After 100 days on the 'Berlin Heart', Oscar's parents, Jason and Louis Tasker (pictured), were told that his heart had made a miraculous recovery and that he no longer needed a transplant . She said: ‘It turned into heart failure and nothing could be done except for a new heart. ‘Now, he is not in intensive care we can hold him, have him out when we like, we dress him, bath him, all the things people take for granted. ‘His personality is shining through, he can be a bit grumpy sometimes but that is understandable but on a good day he just smiles and it is amazing to see. ‘My other five children were all perfectly healthy so for this to happen was quite a shock.’ Oscar has now been transferred back to Birmingham Children's Hospital and is expected to return to the family home within the next two weeks. His father, Jason, 33, a bus driver for National Express, said: ‘The left side of Oscar's heart was dead. Mrs Tasker says that she couldn't believe it when she was told that Oscar was so much better but says that she was delighted to be able to hold him and care for him . ‘The surgeons were saying it wasn't looking good. ‘They were talking about switching off his machine to let him die with dignity. ‘Then we were told we could send him to Newcastle for specialist treatment while waiting for a donor heart. It was our last hope.’ He added: ‘It's like something just clicked. Oscar's like a different baby. He smiles at you, he even moves and kicks his legs. ‘It's all beyond our wildest dreams. I'm still in shock. We'd been hoping and praying for a miracle and we thought a transplant was his last hope. ‘We always hoped he would recover, that he'd keep his own heart. Oscar, pictured with grandmother Ann Tasker, has now been transferred from the specialist heart unit at Freeman Hospital in Newcastle, to his local Birmingham Children's Hospital and is expected to go home within the next two weeks . Jason and Lois Tasker whose son Oscar's heart has miraculously healed itself. See NTI story NTIMIRACLE. A baby has amazed doctors and his parents after a heart defect that would have killed him miraculously HEALED on its own. Little five-month-old Oscar Taskerís body was being starved of oxygen after the main arteries to his heart were the wrong way round when he was born. After undergoing two emergency seven-hour operations within 24 hours at Birmingham Childrenís Hospital, things got worse for Oscar. His chances of survival were dangerously slim when he suffered a cardiac arrest and the left hand side of his heart effectively died. However, after praying for a miracle, his parents, Jason Tasker, 33, and wife Lois, 28, have finally got one. Amazingl . ‘This is like a dream to us, this is the thing we've been waiting for but feared was never going to happen. ‘It's not only great news for Oscar because whatever heart he would have had can now go to another child in need.’ Oscar will soon go home to his brothers and sisters - Liam, two, Milo, three, Ryan, seven, Paige, nine and Abbie, 11. Dr Richard Kirk, consultant paediatric cardiologist in charge of Oscar's care, believes time on the artificial 'Berlin Heart' gave the baby's own organ time to recover. He said: ‘Someone up above must have been smiling down on Oscar. ‘We are delighted but still have to be little bit cautious. He's not out of the woods. ‘We just have to hope he continues with his improvements.’ Dr Kirk said since 2005 when Freeman began using Berlin Hearts about 15 children had recovered in the same way as Oscar.","6-month-old Oscar Tasker was born with main arteries wrong way around .

Infants' blood iron levels were better when the cord was clamped later, a review of previous studies showed. Cutting the umbilical cord immediately after birth - currently standard practice - puts the baby at risk of iron deficiency. Cutting the umbilical cord immediately after birth - currently standard practice - puts the baby at risk of iron deficiency . Leaving the cord attached for a few minutes allows the blood in the cord to transfer to the baby. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) is to publish new guidelines next year. In many countries it's standard practice to clamp the umbilical cord connecting mother and baby less than a minute after birth. But cutting the cord too soon may reduce the amount of blood that passes from mother to baby via the placenta - affecting the baby's iron stores. On the other hand delayed cord clamping - which is carried out more than a minute after birth - may also slightly increase the risk of jaundice. The World Health Organisation now recommends cord clamping between one and three minutes after birth. Leaving the cord attached for a few minutes allows the blood in the cord to transfer to the baby . The existing guidance on cord-clamping was published in 2007 when the consensus was that cutting the cord immediately was the best option - something which had been the case for decades. But since then researchers have questioned whether that is still the case. The latest study involving 3,911 women and their babies showed clamping the cord later made no difference to the risk of maternal haemorrhaging, blood loss or haemoglobin levels and babies were healthier in a number of respects. When cord cutting was delayed babies had higher haemoglobin levels between one and two days after birth and were less likely to be iron deficient three to six months after birth. Birth weight was also higher with delayed cord clamping. Dr Philippa Middleton, of Adelaide University, said: ‘In light of growing evidence delayed cord clamping increases early haemoglobin concentrations and iron stores in infants, a more liberal approach to delaying clamping of the umbilical cord in healthy babies appears to be warranted.’ Clamping the cord later did lead to a slightly higher number of babies needing treatment for jaundice which is treated by light therapy. Dr Middleton said: ‘The benefits of delayed cord clamping need to be weighed against the small additional risk of jaundice in newborns. ‘Later cord clamping to increase iron stores might be particularly beneficial in settings where severe anaemia is common.’ The study is published in The Cochrane Library.","Cutting the cord immediately after birth puts baby at risk of iron deficiency .

A blind Chinese student has astounded her teachers by successfully learning to read braille with her lips. Tsang Tsz-Kwan, 20, from Hong Kong, has scored in the top five per cent for nearly all her subjects in the city's college entrance examination despite being blind and severely hearing-impaired. She chose to use her lips instead of the traditional fingertip-method because her fingertips could not read the Braille character bumps that make up the code. Scroll down for video . Tsang Tsz-Kwan, 20, from Hong Kong, (pictured) is blind and severely hearing impaired and started to read Braille with her lips when she was five-years-old. She said she doesn't remember why it occurred to her to try using her lips when she found it difficult to use her fingertips . 'In Primary 1 (the equivalent Reception in the UK when children are aged between four and five), I noticed that she was always leaning forward,' Mee-Lin Chiu, a teacher at the Ebenezer School and Home for the Visually Impaired -- the only special needs school in Hong Kong dedicated to the blind - told CNN. 'She told me it was because she could read more clearly with her lips than her hands.' Tsang admitted that she doesn't quite remember when she started using her lips and why it even occurred to her to try it out . The lips, tongue, and fingertips are particularly skilled at sensing objects and distance however. The skin in these areas can perceive two points that are only one or two mm apart while the legs or back of the hands can only detect two points with a separation of more than 50-100 millimeters. Braille is a series of raised dots that can be read with the fingers by people who are blind. It was invented by Louise Braille, a French15-year-old teenager, in 1809. Braille is not a language. - it is a code by which languages such as English or Spanish may be written and read. Braille symbols are formed within units of space known as braille cells. A full braille cell consists of six raised dots arranged in two parallel rows each having three dots. The dot positions are identified by numbers from one through to six. 64 combinations are possible using one or more of these six dots. A single cell can be used to represent an alphabet letter, number, punctuation mark, or even a whole word. While Tsang is not the first person to lip-read Braille, she is a rare case. Diane Wormsely, a professor at North Carolina Central University who specialises in education for the visually impaired, said it was the first time she had heard of someone successfully using the lips. Tsang added that some people have stared at her when she has tried to 'read' in public. She said that even now, many people find it odd and that it has caused embarrassment when she reads in front of people that she doesn't know. It also poses practical problems, as Braille books are typically large and heavy. Nonetheless, Tsang said she is grateful""to still have a way to learn about the world through the written word. She said that reading is one of her favourite past times and it can help her transcend her disabilities through hard work, determination, and the willingness to push herself outside of her comfort zone. She explained that without the courage to challenge herself, there was no possibility of success. Indeed, despite her disabilities, Tsang has been incredibly successful at school. Braille, a code used by blind people to read documents, is traditionally read by the fingertips. The lips, tongue and fingertips are the only parts of the body sensitive enough to differentiate between objects just one or two mm apart . She scored 5**, the highest possible grade, for Chinese, English, and Liberal Studies; 5* for Chinese Literature and English Literature and 4 for Math. 'I was really astonished and excited when I heard that my results in some of the subjects were far from my expectations,' she said. 'I felt my hard work this year has finally paid off. I'm going to treasure what I still have.' Tsang now hopes to study translation at university, starting this autumn.","Tsang Tsz-Kwan, 20, from Hong Kong, is blind and severely hearing impaired and started to read with her lips when she was 5-years-old .

A mother-of-three has survived deadly meningitis three times after the bug infiltrated her brain via a hole in her skull. Janine Blackhurst, now 39, was first struck down with meningitis when she was five and then went to catch different strains when she was 33 and then 37, just weeks before her wedding day. It was not until the third bout that doctors discovered the hole in her skull, next to her sinuses, that was exposing her brain to the bacterial and viral infections. Janine, 39, (pictured on her wedding day in 2011) has survived meningitis three times. She married shortly after her third encounter with the deadly condition which left her temporarily unable to walk. Three months after her wedding she underwent surgery to close the hole in her skull that was making her prone to the infection . Mrs Blackhurst caught the meningococcus strain of the bug when she was five-years-old. She responded well to treatment and made a full recovery. She then enjoyed good health - apart from frequent colds and flu - until October 2007, when she was rushed to hospital again. Mrs Blackhurst, then 33, was diagnosed with meningitis again but this time it was the pneumococcal strain. She said: 'I thought I’d been unlucky to get it the first time so I couldn’t believe it when they said I had it again.' After spending two weeks in hospital on strong antibiotics, she was finally allowed home. Tests showed Janine had a weak immune system and doctors believed that she had probably contracted meningitis a second time because of this. She was given a series of injections to help boost her immune system. But in 2011 - and just weeks before she was due to marry her partner Stephen Blackhurst, 34 - she was struck down with the same strain of the bug again. Janine (pictured with husband Stephen on their honeymoon) was born with a small hole in her skull which opportunistic bacteria used as a gateway to her brain. When she caught meningitis for the third time, paramedics said her temperature was so high that 'she was cooking inside' Janine, who works in a chip shop, said: 'I developed what I thought was a migraine and took myself to bed only to wake at 6am with the worst pains in my head I’d ever experienced. 'By the time the ambulance arrived, I was fitting and lashing out. The paramedics couldn’t do anything with me. 'I’d become violent as well because of the temperature and I wasn’t responding to the medication they were giving me. 'They then rang for a doctor to come from the hospital to sedate me so they could get me out of the house.' Paramedics told her worried daughter, Bobbi-Jo Caffery, 19, that her mother’s temperature was so high, she was ‘cooking from the inside out.’ At hospital, doctors kept her in a darkened room and ran brain scans. Initially, they thought Janine had suffered a brain haemorrhage but a lumbar puncture revealed she actually had pneumococcal meningitis. Ms Blackhurst's eye became paralysed shut as the infection took hold. Initially, doctors thought Janine had suffered a brain haemorrhage but a lumbar puncture revealed she actually had meningitis for a third time . Ms Blackhurst said she lokoed as if she had suffered a stroke. When she woke from her coma, she could not talk, walk or feed herself . Mrs Blackhurst was immediately given . intravenous antibiotics to fight the infection and spent eight . days in a coma in intensive care while doctors battled to save her. When she woke up, she couldn’t talk, walk or feed herself. She said: 'All my left side seemed to be worse and my left eye wouldn’t open. I looked like I’d had a stroke. 'All I wanted to do was go home as I was due to get married in ten weeks. I was devastated. We’d cancelled the wedding once already back in 2009. 'I told Stephen to call it off but he, Bobbi-Jo and my gran persuaded me to change my mind. 'It was something to work towards. I was determined to get myself better. Everything was organised and paid for.' Brain scans showed that Mrs Blackhurst had a very small hole in her skull (right) which had made her brain prone to infection. During surgery to fix the hole they then discovered that a small amount of brain had grown through the skull which had had to be removed . It was at this point that doctors discovered Janine had a . hole in her skull, just behind her sinuses. They believed that this had exposed her brain to both the bacterial and viral forms of meningitis. To close the hole in Mrs Blackhurst's head, surgeons removed bone from her leg (pictured after doctors extracted a small amount of bone) and grafted it onto the skull . After three weeks in hospital, Mrs Blackhurst was discharged and with the help of physiotherapy she took her first steps. She was referred to a specialist who told her she needed an operation to fill the hole to reduce the risk of her contracting meningitis again - and they could use bone from her leg to do it. Janine decided to go ahead with the wedding and doctors agreed to postpone theoperation. She said: 'It was a lovely day especially considering I nearly didn’t make it. It was emotional for me but I think even more so for Stephen and my family as they were the ones who had to see me so ill.' A month later, Janine went into hospital for the operation. Surgeons were left stunned when what they initially thought might be a polyp, an abnormal growth, in her left nostril was actually piece of her brain that had grown through the hole. Janine said: 'It had grown through the hole and died so they cut it out. I couldn’t quite believe it when they told me. It was weird. Having a defect in the skull which exposes the brain to infection is not unheard off, according to specialist research and education manager Jane Blewitt of the Meningitis Trust. She said: 'A group of pneumococcal bacteria that cause minor infections are very opportunistic and have been known, on rare occasions, to use a small hole in the skull as a gateway to the brain.' Mrs Blackhurst was in hospital for five days and was then released with dressings packed into my nose to keep the bone graft in place.' A week later, doctors confirmed the operation had been a success. Janine said: 'It was such a relief. 'I wasn’t well enough to go on the honeymoon so we had to postpone. We’ve just got back home. We went to Majorca and it was well worth the wait. 'I’m so lucky because things could have been very different. I’m lucky to be alive.'

Scientists believe this is because sunlight raises levels of the feel-good hormones serotonin and dopamine, and of sex-boosting testosterone. Previous research has shown that men have up to 33 per cent more testosterone flowing through their bodies in June than in January, and it is known that men with more testosterone have more orgasms. Britons have more sex in August than any other month. This could be because sunlight raises levels of feel-good hormones, and of testosterone . This is supported by a recent study from the Medical University of Gras in Austria, which revealed that men with more Vitamin D in their blood also have more testosterone in their blood. As Vitamin D levels can be boosted by sunlight, the researchers concluded that men are more likely to have high testosterone levels in the summer. The poll, carried out by sex toy company Lovehoney, revealed that August is not the only summer month that inspires love-making – July was found to be the second sexiest month, and June the third. The researchers believe that other reasons for the increased passion displayed during the summer months could be that people are wearing fewer clothes, and that the sun makes people feel happy and sexy. They also added that people are given more opportunities to have sex when they are on holiday. In contrast, the survey found that the winter months are the most sexually desolate, with people having the least sex in the traditionally romantic month of February. Men have 33 per cent more testosterone flowing through bodies in June than in January, and it is known that men with more testosterone have more orgasms . Researchers concluded that this could be because people have more of the hormone melatonin in their bodies in the winter and that this results in lower sex drive, depression and lethargy. The poll also revealed that 75 per cent of people are happy with their sex life. 1. August . 2. July . 3. June . 4. May . 5. December . 6. September . 7. April . 8. October . 9. March . 10.

'They can use this to make them feel sexier and better about themselves. Women are better at interacting with others than men and they feel better when they do.'

George Zimmerman's chief defense lawyer on Monday called Florida prosecutors 'a disgrace to my profession' for holding back evidence for months and pledged a new effort to impose sanctions against them. Mark O'Mara and co-counsel Don West argued the self-defense case that helped Zimmerman win an acquittal of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges on Saturday for the 2012 shooting death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin. The law requires prosecutors to share evidence with defense attorneys, especially if it helps exonerate defendants. The requirement is known as the Brady disclosure. 'Disgrace': Mark O'Mara accused prosecutors of withholding evidence from his team in the build up to the trial, which is prohibited by the Brady Disclosure . O'Mara accused prosecutors of several Brady violations, which were heard by Judge Debra Nelson before the trial. Nelson postponed some of her decisions on sanctions until after trial, saying the process was time-consuming. 'This is not acceptable, and is not going to be tolerated in any case that I'm involved in,' O'Mara told Reuters in New York on Monday, accusing special prosecutor Angela Corey and lead trial attorney Bernie de la Rionda of Brady violations. 'They are a disgrace to my profession,' O'Mara said, referring specifically to de la Rionda and Corey. 'They said my client was 'lucky' to have been acquitted. Really?' Not guilty: George Zimmerman, left, was acquitted of the murder of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, right, on Saturday . Corey responded that O'Mara's comments were unprofessional and challenged him to point to any judge's ruling that her office improperly withheld evidence. 'Our office adhered to the highest standards of ethical behavior,' Corey told Reuters in a telephone interview. 'Our rules of professional conduct regulate comments like that. I don't think those are the kind of comments that are appropriate.' Her office confirmed last week that it had fired its information technology director, Ben Kruidbos, who had testified in a pre-trial hearing that files he created with text messages and images he retrieved from Martin's phone were not handed to the defense. 'Unacceptable': O'Mara branded State Attorney Angela Corey, left, and her assistant state attorney Bernie de la Rionda, right, as 'a disgrace' to the legal profession . Kruidbos testified last month that he found embarrassing photos on Martin's phone that included pictures of a clump of jewelry on a bed, underage nude females, marijuana plants and a hand holding a semi-automatic pistol. O'Mara said he intends to amend his request for sanctions against the prosecutors in light of testimony from the trial, calling prosecutors' failure to turn over data from Martin's phone records for months 'an undeniable Brady violation.' Prosecutors handed over raw data from Martin's phone, but O'Mara accused them of withholding additional data that had been extracted by Kruidbos. Corey countered that the judge determined the defense was in possession. O'Mara has quarreled with the prosecutors since they charged Zimmerman last year and has become increasingly aggressive in his criticism of the prosecution since his client's acquittal. A jury in Sanford, Florida, found Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter after a three-week trial in which defense lawyers argued that the neighborhood watch volunteer, shot Martin in self-defense.","Mark O'Mara claims prosecutor Angela Corey and team violated legal code .

'I wasn’t going to make the airport,' he said. 'I used the cars to kind of direct me in the direction of the highway - the lights from the cars. And I was able to land on 321 successfully.' Relief: Greene and Cole look at the plane, which landed between them as they drove north of U.S. 321 . Probe: Klein apologized but the FAA will also investigate whether there are any faults with the plane . While he was relieved to have landed without a problem - or without causing harm to himself or anyone else on the road - he was apologetic for the incident. '[I was] frightened, scared,' he said. 'I feel foolish and sorry for all the problems I'm causing people. It won't happen again.' The road was closed until the plane was towed from the highway to the airport around 3 a.m. The Federal Aviation Administration plans to investigate and inspectors will interview the pilot and inspect the aircraft, which will likely take a few weeks.

"By . Mark Duell . PUBLISHED: . 20:55 EST, 15 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:47 EST, 16 July 2013 . An astronomer studying old images of Neptune found a 14th moon orbiting the planet - by accident. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) revealed the find yesterday and said the moon, estimated to be about 12 miles in diameter, is located approximately 65,400 miles from Neptune. Astronomer Mark Showalter, from the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California, was searching Hubble Space Telescope images for moons inside faint ring fragments circling Neptune. Accidental find: This composite Hubble Space Telescope picture shows the location of a newly discovered moon, S/2004 N 1, orbiting Neptune. It's 100million times fainter than the faintest star visible with the naked eye . Neptune's . largest moon, Triton, was discovered in 1846, just days after the . planet itself was found. Nereid, Neptune's third largest moon, was found . in 1949. Images taken by . NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft unveiled the second largest moon, Proteus, . and five smaller moons, Naiad, Thalassa, Despina, Galatea and Larissa. Ground-based telescopes found Halimede, Laomedeia, Sao and Nestor in 2002. Sister moon Psamathe turned up a year later. The expert said: ‘We had been processing the data for quite some time and it was on a whim that I said, 'OK, let's just look out further'.’ ‘I changed my program so that instead of stopping just outside the ring system it processed the data all the way out. 'I walked away from my computer and waited an hour while it did all the processing.’ ‘When I came back, I looked at the image. There was this extra dot that wasn't supposed to be there.’ Follow-up analysis of other archived Hubble images of Neptune verified the object was a moon. The tiny moon has previously escaped detection by NASA's . Voyager 2 spacecraft, which flew past Neptune in 1989 and surveyed the . planet's system of moons and rings. In space: This diagram released by NASA shows the orbits of several moons located close to the planet Neptune. Neptune's largest moon, Triton, was discovered in 1846, just days after the planet itself was found . Mr Showalter said: 'The moons and arcs orbit very quickly, . so we had to devise a way to follow their motion in order to bring out . the details of the system.' 'It's the same reason a sports photographer tracks a running athlete — the athlete stays in focus, but the background blurs.' Neptune's moons and arcs 'smear out' when captured by the Hubble Telescope because of their rapid orbital motion. The astronomer re-processed the images to compensate for this smear and discovered the new moon as an extra white dot that has escaped attention before. Interestingly, the moon is too faint to be seen in individual images but was noticeable when experts looked at sets of ten images together. The astronomer has tracked the moon's movement in more than 150 pictures taken by Hubble from 2004 to 2009. He then plotted a circular orbit for the moon, which completes one revolution around Neptune every 23 hours. Mr Showalter made the discovery after he decided to focus his attention beyond Neptune's faint ring that contains its known moons (pictured). 'I looked at the image. There was this extra dot that wasn't supposed to be there,' he said . Mr Showalter and colleagues are mulling . over a name to propose to the International Astronomical Union, which . has final say in the matter. ‘We haven't really gotten far with that,’ he said. ‘What I can say is that the name will be out of Roman and Greek mythology and it will have to do with characters who are related to Neptune, the god of the oceans.’ The newly found moon, designated S/2004 N 1, is located between Larissa and Proteus. It orbits Neptune in 23 hours. The moon is so small and dim that it is 100million times fainter than the faintest star that can be seen with the naked eye. The considerably bigger gas giant Jupiter has four times as many moons, with 67. The astronomer is pondering names for the new moon but thinks that it may reference Roman or Greek mythology and be linked to characters related to the god of the ocean, Neptune.

The daughter of disgraced music producer Phil Spector has revealed the toll of prison life on her father. Spector, 73, is serving a prison sentence of 19 years to life for the 2003 murder of actress Lana Clarkson. Nicole Audrey Spector, 30, said each time she sees her 'pop' , he looks 'thinner, wispier.' The daughter of disgraced music producer Phil Spector has spoken out about her father's life in jail.  Nicole Audrey Spector, 30, said each time she sees her 'pop' he looks 'thinner, wispier' Before the killing: Nicole poses with her father in 2000- three years before he shot actress Lana Clarkson dead . The music producer who worked with famous bands including The Beatles, is currently housed in California State Prison, Corcoran. In 2009 he was found guilty of shooting the 40-year-old actress in the mouth in the foyer of his sprawling California mansion. Nicole is one of Spector's five children - she was born when the musician was with his then-girlfriend Janis Zavala. Her twin brother  Philip Jr. died of leukaemia, aged ten. Guilty: In 2009 Spector was found guilty of shooting the 40-year-old actress in the mouth in the foyer of his sprawling California mansion . Grim: The sprawling California mansion where Spector shot dead the B-movie actress . Evidence: The Colt revolver found near Clarkson's body is seen here in an evidence photo presented during the trial . Spector . was famous for his Wall of Sound production technique, which scored him . a slew of hits including The Beatles' Let It Be. He also co-wrote 'You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'' for the Righteous Brothers and produced records for the Ramones. Nicole, . who is now a writer, said in an article for The Times insists her . father is innocent: 'My father, who I love like a son, didn’t kill . anyone. Neither of us is supposed to be here.' She said her visits have become less frequent due to not having a home in California. Changing image: Spector in court in 2005, left, and right with his third wife Rachelle Short in 2007 . Sporadic: Over the years Spector, who is famous for his wigs has dramatically altered his appearance . 'The last time I visited was nine . months ago, a fact that makes me anxious and ashamed. I feel I should be . there every weekend. But I don’t have a home in California anymore. I . used to be able to stay in my old room in my father’s house, which he . still has, but his wife won’t allow it, and I’m not up for the fight . anymore.' She is referring to Spector's third Rachelle Short - a model and actress around 40 years his junior. The couple met at a Hollywood restaurant in 2003, shortly after his arrest in the shooting of actress Lana Clarkson. Rachelle went to work as Spector's assistant and was running his . business by the time they married in 2006 in the foyer of his mansion, . where Clarkson was found dead. Spector's . initial trial in 2007 for the murder of Lana Clarkson, who died from a . gun shot wound to the head, ended in a deadlocked jury. But a second jury in 2009 found him guilty of second degree murder with a sentence of 19 years in prison. Throughout both hearings Spector's high-priced defence team had claimed that Miss Clarkson killed herself in a fit of despair over her fading film career. Spector had met the struggling actress, 40, at a Hollywood nightclub where she was working as a hostess at the time, and invited her back to his Alhambra mansion. But while Spector strongly maintained his innocence outside the Los Angeles courtroom, he chose not to put his side of the story from the witness box. His chaffeur Adriano de Souza testified he saw Spector clutching a pistol shortly after Miss Clarkson was shot, saying: 'I think I just killed somebody.' Spector, a man obsessed with guns, liked to dine out on the story that he once pulled a pistol on John Lennon in a recording studio. But in the end, his violent past caught up with the man who worked with stars like the Beatles, Tina Turner, The Ronettes and the Righteous Brothers in his heyday and was credited with revolutionising pop production in the 1960. Wall of sound: Spector (sitting) with George Harrison and the Ronettes including his first wife Veronica Bennett, left . A procession of women gave evidence about Spector's drunken attacks, invariably involving guns. They painted a disturbing picture of an out-of-control maniac, drunk on his own reputation and convinced that he was too famous to be brought to account. Threatened and terrorised by Spector, his victims - who were either dating him or longtime friends - never called police. It was only when Clarkson's body was discovered in a pool of blood in the early hours of February 3, 2003 - with Spector standing over her with a gun - that his previous victims began to come forward. One after another they told the court a variation on essentially the same story; how Spector, a normally charismatic if rather strange man, would fly into a rage after drinking too much and threaten them with guns when they tried to leave.","Spector, 72, shot actress Lana Clarkson, 40, in 2003 at his mansion .

George Zimmerman's parents have spoken out for the first time following his acquittal for the murder of Trayvon Martin, saying that their son is not a racist and that they haven't spoken to him since he left the courtroom on Saturday. Robert and Gladys Zimmerman said that they fear that anytime they call their son, their phones will be tapped, leading to people finding out his location - a hideout so secretive that even they have no idea where he is living. They revealed that their son's legal saga has left them broke. They had to flee their own house and fear for their own lives, as well as George's, following countless death threats. 'Only time will tell,' Gladys said when predicting what whether or not George and his wife Shelly will ever be able come out of hiding. WATCH THE VIDEO HERE . Their side: Gladys and Robert Zimmerman spoke out for the first time in an interview taped on Monday, saying that they fear for their son's life . Breaking composure: George's parents said that he appeared stoic in court in an effort to be serious and unemotional . 'Even for us who have not been living a normal life for the past months, it is hard because we have lost everything,' she said of her and her husband Robert. 'If I was him, I would (stay in hiding),' Robert said during the ABC interview, the first portion of which was aired Monday evening. The Zimmermans have stood by their son since he became the subjects of massive public anger and protests when he was named as the man who killed unarmed Trayvon Martin. They have both given TV interviews before - but never together. Robert is a retired Virginia court magistrate. Gladys is Peruvian by birth and raised the couple's three children. As protests over the verdict rage on, the next step in the legal saga is the prospect that the Justice Department will file civil charges against Zimmerman, potentially trying him on the grounds that the shooting of Martin was considered a hate crime. What's next: Attorney General Eric Holder (right) said that the Justice Department will continue their civil investigation into whether or not the killing of Martin (left) was a hate crime . Gladys said she cannot do say to satiate the protestors who are seeking vengeance for the killing of teenage Travyon. 'This is America, and we went through all of this with the judicial system,' Gladys said. 'They wanted an arrest for my son. They got an arrest. Now lets, you know, find a verdict ... now they have a verdict. 'He . went through the whole process they were pushing for, and now they are . not happy with the verdict, and I pray. I pray for them, for God to . touch their heart.' In their first televised interview with Barbara Walters on ABC News, Robert Zimmerman defended his son, saying that claims that prejudice caused the violent outcome are false. When asked if George is racist, Robert said: 'absolutely not. He's never been taught to be a racist.' 'When George first saw Trayvon Martin he had no idea what color he was. 'He knew he was inside a gated community. He didn't recognize him as living there. It was raining. He was just casually walking very slowly. But George did not initially know what race a person was.' Fighting rages on: A Zimmerman supporter (left) is caught in a war of words with Trayvon supporters in New York's Union Square on Sunday, the day after the verdict was reached . While not going into details, Robert . and Gladys said that their lives have been completely uprooted since the . trial, and that they have been just some on the growing roster of . targets for death threats. 'We've had an enormous amount of death threats,' Robert Zimmerman said. 'George's legal counsel has had death threats, the police chief of Sanford. May people have had death threats.' He said the words that have been sent to them by supporters of Trayvon's family have been sickening. 'Everyone with Georgie's DNA should be killed' - just every kind of horrible thing you can imagine,' Robert said. 'I never thought that we would see so much hatred, and the hatred is not brought on by any racial incident. 'It was brought on by attorneys being totally untruthful, other people being involved, having a certain narrative, having a certain agenda, and making this situation race-based and a political issue.' Their . fear has kept the Zimmermans from reaching out to their controversial . son, with their only interaction being inside the courtroom immediately . following the verdict. 'I hug him, I kiss him and he said ""Thank you mom, I want to go home,""' Gladys told Walters. Asked what they would say to the parents of Trayvon, Gladys said there was little that words could do. 'It's nothing I can tell them, it's only something I can do: I can pray,' she said. 'We are deeply sorry for this tragedy, and we pray for the departed, we pray for Trayvon Martin.'","Gladys and Robert Zimmerman spoke out about how they have only been able to speak to their son George inside the courtroom .

Club Indulge is a London-based club night designed for 'plus-size people and their friends and admirers'. Miranda Cheeseman (left, with plus-size fashion blogger Naomi Griffiths on one of the Club Indulge nights) started the event after becoming fed up with treatment she got in regular venues . People of all sizes are welcome but any judgemental attitudes need to be left at the door. Miranda, from East Finchley in North London, hopes the night will be an escape from the bullying she says her and her friends have endured since they started partying aged 18. She said: 'I have had experiences where a guy walks up to you and offers to buy you a drink and you look over his shoulder and his friends are jeering and laughing and nudging each other I just think it would be nice to go to a place where men buy you a drink and they mean it.' Indulge: The event's website features a voluptuous Jessica Rabbit inspired character . Like regular clubs, there is music, . drinking, dancing and flirting. There's a dance floor and a separate area for chilling and talking. Unlike most other night spots the . dress code here stipulates dressing your fabulous curves to impress (and . they don't want to see anything by size-ist U.S. brand Abercrombie . & Fitch) and there's even a speed meet beforehand so . that anyone that has travelled a long way can meet some new friends . before the night begins. 31-year-old Cheesman, who also works in freelance media production, says she doesn't want this to be just another BBW .

The Wisconsin father who killed his three young girls to get revenge on his ex-wife has been sentenced to life in prison without parole. A jury ruled that Aaron Schaffhausen- who called his wife saying ‘you can come home now, I killed the kids’- was sane at the time of the July 2012 triple murder but he was only today that he was sentenced to spend the rest of his life behind bars. Schaffhausen, 35, had admitted he killed 11-year-old Amara, 8-year-old Sophie and 5-year-old Cecilia at their River Falls home to get back at his ex-wife, but argued he had a mental defect that kept him from knowing it was wrong. Scroll down for video . Behind bars: Aaron Schaffhausen, seen here during the trial, was sentenced to three consecutive life sentences without the chance of parole after killing his three young daughters . Horror: Amara Schaffhausen (center), 11, Sophie Schaffhausen (left), 8, and Cecilia Schaffhausen (right), 5, were found dead in their home and their father is charged with killing them during an unexpected visit . Life sentences were mandatory in each . girl's death, but Schaffhausen had the prospect of supervised release . after at least 20 years in prison. That . was rejected by St. Croix County Circuit Judge Howard Cameron, who . said: 'I don't see mental illness as a mitigating factor.' 'This is a vicious, aggravated crime,' Cameron said before handing down the sentence. The judge chose consecutive life sentences to send a message that 'each child is so important.' Evidence showed that Schaffhausen texted his ex-wife on July 10, 2012, to ask for an unscheduled visit with the girls. She . consented but said he had to be gone before she got home because she . didn't want to see him. The girls' baby sitter told investigators the . children were excited when he arrived, and the sitter left. He called his ex-wife, Jessica Schaffhausen, about two hours later, saying: 'You can come home now, I killed the kids.' Tragic lives taken too soon: Amara, 11, five-year-old Cecilia and eight-year-old Sophie (left to right) were all supposedly happy to see their father when he showed up for the unexpected visit . Police . arrived to find the girls lying in their beds, their throats slit and . their blankets pulled up to their necks. White T-shirts were tied around . their necks. Cecilia's body also showed signs of strangulation. As he did throughout his trial, Aaron Schaffhausen sat impassively as family members and attorneys read their statements. Jessica . Schaffhausen's sister, Mary Elizabeth Stotz, described Aaron . Schaffhausen as 'the darkness, the boogeyman' that every child fears. 'He took their unconditional love for him, and used that love to lure them to get close enough (to) kill them,' Stotz said. 'Their last memory was what an evil killer their dad was.' Eryn . Schlotte, the girls' cousin, said Schaffhausen took away from her 'the . future of seeing them smile, and what I had to look forward to when . school got out. Charged: Lawyers for Schaffhausen, 35, of Minot, North Dakota,initially tried to say that he was insane at the time of the triple murders but the court overruled that ploy . 'I thought . the world was a better place than this. Not a place where someone got . killed before they were even in kindergarten or middle school.' With . family members crying and sharing tissues, lead prosecutor Gary . Freyberg read his statement, saying Schaffhausen used the girls 'as . pawns ... to make Jessica suffer.' 'How . wrong is it to use his intellect, his size and his brute strength not . to protect his children from danger, but to become the most dangerous . person in the world to them?' he asked. Freyberg . said consecutive life sentences with no possibility of release was the . only way for Jessica Schaffhausen to be free of fear that her ex-husband . would someday come for her. Schaffhausen argued that his client committed the crimes to help break his dependency on his ex-wife Jessica, seen here in an old photo with their youngest daughter Cecilia as a baby . Happier days: The prosecution argued that Aaron used his children (Amara at left and Sophie at right) as pawns . Trial . testimony showed that in the months leading up to the killings, . Schaffhausen told several people he had thoughts of killing his . daughters. His ex-wife . testified that in March 2012, he called her from Minot, North Dakota — . where he was working — and told her he 'wanted to drive down there and . tie me up and make me pick which child he killed and make me watch while . he killed them.' He also called his ex-wife repeatedly, sometimes up to 30 times a day, and threatened to kill the man she was dating. Schaffhausen . didn't testify at his trial. His defense attorney argued at trial that . Schaffhausen has a rare mental disorder rooted in deep dependency on his . ex-wife, and believed the only way he could 'solve' his problem was to . commit suicide or homicide.

George Osborne is considering an extra squeeze on benefits to ensure no family can get more than £20,000 a year in state handouts. Treasury aides confirmed that the Chancellor will examine the case for lowering the new benefit cap further if it proves effective in cutting the welfare bill and pushing the jobless into work. The Government’s £26,000 cap came into force this week, despite Labour opposition. An extra squeeze: Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne in the House of Commons, London 2013 . The Mail revealed yesterday that further measures, including a limit on child-related handouts after the first two children and an end to housing benefit for the under-25s, are being considered. Tory sources said Labour’s welfare spokesman, Liam Byrne, had opened the way for further benefit limits by complaining that workless families with six or more children would only be partially affected by the new cap. Until they are transferred to the new universal credit, around 4,000 large families will see housing benefit deducted, but will still receive more than £26,000 in  other handouts. Liam Byrne MP Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions . Jobless lone parents with seven or more children or workless  couples with six or more children will therefore escape the full cap. An unemployed couple with 10 children, for instance, could still receive £41,000 a year  in benefits because of child-related handouts. Labour insists the cap is too low for areas with high property prices, such as London, but Mr Byrne’s decision to highlight this anomaly will encourage the Tories to bring forward legislation limiting benefits for large families and challenge Labour to back it. ‘We are very surprised Labour wants to have this debate, given their out-of-touch opposition to the benefits cap, but now they have started it, there is a good argument for testing whether they’re willing to put their money where their mouth is,’ said a  Tory source. ‘Even if the Lib Dems cannot be persuaded to move further, a limit on child-related benefits could be implemented if Labour is really ready to support it.’ Mr Osborne is prepared to consider cutting the overall £500-a-week cap on benefits ‘based on evidence, not politics’, a source confirmed. The cap was introduced this week based on the average  salary of £26,000, despite claims from Labour MPs and charities that much of the spending is on housing costs and it risks forcing many families into hardship. Polls suggest many voters believe the cap should be even lower and Conservative MPs have suggested it should be cut to £20,000, arguing that workers would have to earn £35,000 before taking home £26,000 after tax. Cutting the cap to £20,000 could save a further £840million a year. Brooks Newmark, a Tory MP on the Commons Treasury committee, said: ‘Many people would be in favour of bringing it down to the real average post-tax pay.’ His colleague Chris Skidmore, the MP for Kingswood, said: ‘The cap remains very high at a time when many people are working and earning less than that. ‘In the longer term, a cap of £20,000 would better reflect  average wages.’ Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said yesterday that in the four London boroughs where the cap had been piloted, a ‘very, very significant number’ of people in affected households had returned to work.","The Government’s £26,000 cap came into force this week .

She's already managed to make an enemy of the usually friendly Holly Willoughby and now it would appear that Katie Hopkins has managed to offend Ultimo boss Michelle Mone too. A bitter Twitter war has broken out between Mone and former Apprentice contestant Hopkins, with Mone questioning Hopkins fame and telling her to keep her 'vile opinions' to herself. Hopkins, who has caused controversy with her forthright opinions on children's names, retaliated by goading Mone about her weight. 'More wisdom from the large lady of the . bra factory in the North? As the tortoise said to the snail. Has anyone . seen me shell?' she wrote. Slugging it out: Former Apprentice star Katie Hopkins and Ultimo lingerie boss, Michelle Mone . Furious: Mone described Hopkins' views on baby names and ginger people as 'vile' Most recently, Hopkins provoked outrage when she said ginger babies were 'harder to love' - much to the fury of Mone and many others. Last night Mone tweeted: 'She won't . employ fat people, judges kids by their names [and] says ginger babies are . hard to love, keep your vile opinions to yourself, Katie Hopkins.' Hopkins, who has stood by her comments about wanting her children to avoid 'the Tylers, the Charmaines, the Chantelles, the Chardonnays,' retorted with a number of vicious tweets of her own. 'Less tweeting, more concentrating 'shell. You just missed that important stitching on the under wire there now.' Furious Mone then replied: 'Leave my multi-million £ business out . of it.. my Tweets are for all the Tyler's, gingers and larger, highly . employable people out there who you've put down.' Responding to the jibe about her weight, Mone tweeted a photo of a healthy salad and shellfish meal and added: '1 week till I take kids . sailing round Spain.Few pounds to shift, thanks for reminding me Miss . Katie Hopkins.' Rude: Hopkins replied with jibes about Mone's weight and the amount of time she spends on Twitter . Outspoken: Hopkins controversial views on baby names have caused a storm - and offended Holly Willoughby . Cashing in: Hopkins has chosen to cash in on the controversy by launching a book named The Class Book Of Baby Names . Members of the public who followed the row on Twitter overwhelmingly took the side of Mone and Hopkins was subjected to a barrage of insulting tweets from her followers. 'Your a vile human being... I actually . feel sorry for your kids,' said one, while another added: 'Michelle: . successful, sexy entrepreneur! Katie: fame-hungry hoor! #nocontest' One follower simply asked: 'and what is you do again Kate ??????' Both Mone and Hopkins have struggled with controversy in recent weeks with Hopkins hitting TV studios to justify her controversial views. Last week, she appeared on This Morning, where she told presenters Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield: 'It isn't just . about class, it's probably about the fact they haven't done their . homework - there's a whole set of things that go with children like that . that is quite a disruptive influence in school.' However Willoughby . struggled to keep calm during the debate, at one point telling her: 'Oh . stop. Stop right there' much to Hopkins' surprise. Hopkins has now cashed in on the controversy caused by her views on baby names and has written an e-book entitled The Class Book Of Baby Names. In the tome, which is already on sale via Amazon, she outlines why some names work and others do not. Highlights include: 'Take Ashley. Shut your eyes and picture mum: legging clad, slightly overweight and clutching Primark bags twice the size of her latest baby. There may be another one on the way, but you can never be sure. 'There only so many times you can hear 'TYLER' yelled aggressively across a playground before you work out Tyler means trouble.' Meanwhile, mother-of-three Mone recently agreed a multi-million pound deal with ex-husband Michael for the control of her company. She revealed she drank up to a bottle of wine a day during her marriage break-up which eventually cost her £24million. The 41-year-old was speaking out for the . first time since her bitter divorce from Michael, who left her for . former employee Samantha Bunn. She was forced to buy Mr Mone out of the . family's Ultimo underwear business in a £24m deal when their marriage . ended in December 2011. Soon after, he announced he was setting up a rival firm with Ms Bunn as chief lingerie designer.","Mone took to Twitter to criticise Hopkins' views on baby names .

A murderer on the run after a knife attack at a paedophile’s home has a fixation with child sex offenders, his ex-wife said yesterday. Convicted double killer Ian McLoughlin, 55, is suspected of a third fatal attack after he was allowed out of jail on day release. He was 21 years into a 25-year minimum sentence – the second time he was let out of prison early, having been freed five years into an eight-year sentence in 1989. Ex-wife Janette Adams, 57, wed McLoughlin in 1983 after he was released from a prison sentence for theft, but they divorced that year after he was arrested for killing a gay man. He was later given eight years for manslaughter. Mrs Adams said McLoughlin – who had reportedly worked as a rent boy – lived on the streets after his parents threw him out at 13. She added: ‘He seems to be very troubled and to have a fixation with paedophiles. 'Considering his past I’m not overly shocked at events that followed. I’ve not heard from him for 35 years.’ McLoughlin is on the run after the death of Graham Buck, 66, on Saturday at the home of a paedophile the killer had met in jail, Old Etonian Francis Cory-Wright, 87. McLoughlin was allegedly robbing Cory-Wright when he is believed to have been interrupted by Mr Buck, who went to help after hearing shouting in Little Gaddesden, Hertfordshire. McLoughlin is suspected of stabbing Mr Buck before fleeing with thousands of pounds. He is then thought to have walked into National Trust mansion Ashridge House and asked a member of staff to call him a taxi, which he took to a pub in Watford. Enlarge . Police looking for double killer Ian McLoughlin in connection with a suspected murder in a quiet village have released this image .

Yesterday, the man who put him behind bars in 1992 for life with a minimum term of 25 years for the murder of his gay landlord asked why he had been allowed out. Retired Detective Superintendent Mike Bennison said: ‘Bearing in mind his previous character he should have stayed behind bars for the rest of his life.’ Family man: Graham Buck, 66, who died in the latest killing, is circled in a family photo .

Tragic: Donations to Susan Taylor's chosen charities have reached £67,000 since she died trying to swim the English Channel . A staggering anonymous donation of £300,000 has today been made to the charities supported by tragic cross-Channel swimmer Susan Taylor. The administrators of her fundraising page were said to be in 'no doubt' the donation is genuine but were waiting for the money to make its way through bank checks before being certain. The donor has asked to remain anonymous and it was possible they might opt not to even have the size of their donation listed on the fundraising website. The money has been pledged to be split evenly, £150,000 each, between the two charities Susan was supporting - Rainbow Children's Hospice and Diabetes UK. As of this morning the combined figure raised stood at £67,000 but that is set to be boosted considerably. Staff at Virgin Money Giving will keep any record of the donation off the list of donors until they are able to confirm the money has been collected and transferred to the bank accounts of the two charities. Karen Payne, spokeswoman for Rainbows Hospice for Children and Young People, said: 'We are aware of an anonymous donation of £150,000 being pledged to our charity but we can't confirm it until the money is in our bank. 'Obviously we are very grateful for all money donated to us and this amount would be great but hopefully you can appreciate we have to be a bit cautious until we receive the money pledged.' Paul Amadi, Diabetes UK’s Director of Fundraising said: 'To receive such a large donation from one person is absolutely amazing and we are extremely grateful. 'We wish the tragic events of Sunday hadn’t happened, but this incredible gift and all the other donations are part of Susan Taylor’s legacy and will go to help people with diabetes and the Rainbows Hospice.'.

'I've had an ambition to follow in comedian David Walliams's strokes and swim the Channel since I was a child,' she wrote. Fundraiser: Mrs Taylor had temporarily given up work to train for the swim . Her mother, Joyce . Wright, said the family had been anxious about the swim, despite her . being in peak physical condition. And she said her 40-year-old son David . felt guilty about being unable to save his sister’s life on the boat. ‘Our son is a paramedic so he’d taken kit with him. He’s devastated. He’s blaming himself,’ added the 68-year-old. ‘But he did everything he . could. He just needs to have a big cuddle when he gets back. Mrs Taylor had spent 18 months . preparing for her arduous challenge in one of the busiest shipping lanes . in the world. She even quit her job as an accountant to train full . time.

'We know Susan wouldn’t have got out of the . water, she wouldn’t give up.’ Susan's father Arthur, 68, added: ‘I’m . devastated. I’ve lost the best person in the world.

I was going to help her achieve her amazing goal that she had set out on two years ago. Tributes: Neighbours at the Taylor family home in Barwell, Leicestershire, paid tribute to a 'truly lovely girl' 'Her commitment to her training meant . that she had put on hold her career as an accountant so that she could . give, because this was what Susan was really about. 'She . was a natural giver. So when Susan approached me two years ago and . asked me if I would be so kind as to help her on her journey - she told . me that she was swimming for charity, the Rainbows Hospice charity based . in Loughborough, my home town. Having taught children with severe . learning difficulties myself for a short time, the answer was a . no-brainer. 'She then added . Diabetes UK - again as a Type 2 diabetic myself, no brainer. On top of . this, she endlessly worked as an ambassador for Rainbows Hospice . charity.' France does not allow cross-Channel . swims to start from its own side because of the dangers posed by . shipping, as well as dangerous currents and changing weather conditions. Mrs Taylor is the eighth swimmer to . die since Captain Matthew Webb made the first unassisted swim across the . Strait of Dover in 1875.

A devoted mother has spent more than a decade fulfilling her daughter's dying wishes after she succumbed to a rare form of bone cancer aged just 17. Rosemary Locock, 57, from Weymouth, Dorset, promised her daughter Karina she would complete her last three requests before she lost her battle with osteosarcoma in 2003. They were to run a marathon, plant roses on her grave and write a book. It has taken more than ten years, but Rosemary has finally been able to keep her word. She not only planted the flowers, but even managed to have a red rose named 'Karina Elouise' in her daughter's honour. After several failed attempts to get a place at the London Marathon, Rosemary went on to run it three times raising money for charity. And finally she managed to self-publish an inspiring book which describes Karina's battle with the illness. Rosemary said: . 'The first thing Karina asked me to do was to plant roses in front of her . grave. But we managed to get a rose named after her. 'We contacted the American Rose Society, who document the names and asked them to call it Karina Elouise. 'The second thing was the London Marathon.

'I did not win, but they got in contact with me and said they were so moved by what I said, so they gave me a place. I ran it three times.' Karina was diagnosed with a rare form of bone cancer in September 2001 when she went to the doctor complaining of a pain in her cheek bone. After an operation to remove the tumour from her face and chemotherapy, she thought she had beaten the cancer but sadly it returned and she died in 2003.

Rosemary added: 'It was very hard for me to write, because it brought back all of those memories of Karina. 'Sometimes I would burst into tears, stop and have to start again. But even when she was ill, she always thought about other people.' More than 200 copies of the book were published with the proceeds going to the hospitals that helped Karina during her illness.

Troops from 13 African countries that took part in the French-led war against al Qaeda-linked extremists in Mali marched with the French military during the Bastille Day parade in Paris to honour their role in the conflict. UN troops in blue berets who are helping to stabilise the west African nation of Mali paraded with thousands of other soldiers down the Champs-Elysees Avenue in France's annual tribute to military might. It marks the storming of the Bastille prison on July 14, 1789, by angry Paris crowds that helped spark the French Revolution. Scroll down for video . France honoured members of the UN stabilisation force to Mali on Bastille Day as they joined the parade along the Champs Elysees . Soldiers from various French regiments, including the Aubagne's 1st Foreign Regiment, pictured, marched along with the African troops who joined together to repel an Islamist insurgency in Mali . Despite the triumphal display, which . included flyovers by fighter jets, tanks and giant trucks mounted with . land-to-air defence systems, the realities in Mali suggest that . President Francois Hollande's military intervention has had mixed . results. The mission he launched in January helped the Malian government retake control of much of the country from al Qaeda-linked extremists who had seized northern Mali and threatened the capital. The nation is to hold elections on July 28, but tensions involving rebel Tuaregs in the north linger, along with political instability. Today's events, however, focused on the positive. 'It's a victory that was won,' Mr . Hollande said in an interview after the parade with the France 2 and . TF-1 in the garden of the presidential Elysee . Palace. 'Look at what happened. It was a victory for Africa, a victory . against terrorism, and pride that we must have.' Soldiers of the Calvi's 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment, France's Foreign Legion, attended the traditional military parade on the Champs Elysees . French students from the military school Polytechnique joined the parade which celebrates the start of the French Revolution in 1789 . He said earlier the presence of African troops in Paris on the French national day was a 'tribute to those who actively helped to banish terrorism from the Malian territory'. Referring to trips he's made to Africa, including a February visit to Mali, four weeks after the start of the French intervention, Mr Hollande said, 'I was saluted in Africa, not for what I said but for what I did.' He noted that some extremists once lodged in Mali escaped into southern Libya and other neighbouring countries. He said those nations need support, 'but we won't make war everywhere.' The military display team, Patrouille de France, streaking over Paris taking in the Pyramide du Louvre . Nine alphajets from the French Air Force releasing trails of the national flag colours, red white and blue, above the crowds . Mr Hollande oversaw the display of military might that France rolls out each year on Bastille Day with Mali interim President Dioncounda Traore and UN chief Ban Ki-moon at his sides. Defence ministers from the African nations represented in the parade also were present. French Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said before the parade that the display is 'the mark of a solidarity that concretely expressed itself in Mali, and of a common destiny, even beyond the limits of continents, of which we have every reason to be proud.' But some critics say the Mali operation and African presence in the parade reflect France's ambiguous and sometimes patronising relations with the continent - especially with former colonies such as Mali - often referred to as Francafrique. The French non-governmental organisation . Survie, which is fighting against neocolonialism, condemned 'the . self-proclaimed role of gendarme of Africa that France claimed in Mali'. The riders of the Republican Guard passing by the Arc de Triomphe on the Place de l'Etoile . Soldiers of the 35th parachute artillery regiment took part in the annual parade in the strong sunshine . 'This parade gives a scent of victory to a military operation which is far from being reasonably presented like that, given the numerous shadows that surround it and the remaining uncertainties concerning its outcome,' said Fabrice Tarrit, the president of the association. The critics also include Africans. 'Knowing the history of France, especially French armies with Africa, it doesn't sound good,' said Senegalese rapper Keyti, whose real name is Cheikh Sene, 40. 'This last decade we've been trying to be really independent from the French army, especially since they had camps in certain countries around Africa,' he said. 'And now with what happened in Mali, what's still happening there, it's like they found another way to come in.' Around 50 Malian troops marched in . formation Sunday followed by soldiers from Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory . Coast, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, . Chad and Togo.

They were followed by troops from the UN stabilisation mission in Mali, which took over the French-led military operation on July 1. Some French soldiers who participated in the Mali operation, called Serval, also marched, and aircraft used in Mali, notably to provide cover for ground troops, were featured in the air display. France had more than 4,000 troops at the height of the campaign, and is now gradually reducing that. France will keep about 1,000 soldiers in Mali after the end of 2013. In all, 4,800 troops marched in front of the presidential stage, along with 241 horses, 265 vehicles and 58 planes. Bringing up the rear was an array of 35 helicopters, used in wartime and for civilian missions. Precision parachutists landed in front of the presidential stand to close the parade.","Bastille Day commemorates the storming of the Bastille, which sparked  the French Revolution in 1789 .
