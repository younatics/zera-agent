Red meat allergies caused by a single, tiny species of tick are becoming increasingly common in a well-known enclave of some of the wealthiest people in America. Tucked away at the tip of Long Island, New York, the Hamptons have long been a refuge for the rich from the sweltering New York City summer. And it may also increasingly be a haven for the Lone Star tick, a small critter that causes a big problem. That is, if  you’re a meat eater. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO... Odd reaction: The increasingly common lone star tick, named for the spot on the female's back, appears to inject a substance when it bites that causes victims to become allergic to red meat, sometimes violently . ‘It's a huge problem out here,’ says Erin McGintee, an allergist in East Hampton, N.Y. told WSJ.com. ‘I've been trying to get the word out.’ There may be a lot fewer filet minons hitting the grill this summer. Symptoms of the strange illness range from mild, like abdominal cramps, to severe, like anaphylaxis and even death. Hives, difficulty breathing, and vomiting are also possible. And they all stem from eating red meat. Though researchers say the symptoms, unlike those from typical food allergies, may take hours to take hold. Burger time? Residents of the Hamptons, New York's summer playground for the rich, are increasingly being bitten by ticks that cause severe reactions to red meat in some people . Little bugger: The head of a lone star tick. Researchers think the bug's bite can inject a sugar called alpha-gal that causes future encounters with the substance, also found in red meat, to trigger an allergic response . Six years ago, Tony Piazza of Southampton, New York says he began waking up unable to breath in the middle of the night, covered in hives. It happened every few months for years and doctors could only say it was some sort of allergy and administer antihistamines. But then Piazza, 49, noticed the symptoms only occurred when he ate meat. First it was lamb, then steak, then burgers. ‘I swore off red meat completely, and the reactions stopped,’ he said. Researchers believe the tick passes on a kind of carbohydrate called alpha-gal that is present in meat. It is believed that, after a tick encounter, some people’s immune systems begin to treat alpha-gal as an allergen. Hence, the often serious reactions. And the problem may be becoming more widespread. The lone star tick—which is not named for the state of Texas, but for the single white spot on the backs of females—was once confined to the ‘tick belt’ of the Southeastern U.S., but has increasingly been found further into Western and Northern states. Along with the tick, the cases seem to be spreading. Hence, the sudden increase of cases in the Hamptons. Worse and worse: And the problem is spreading. Once confined to the Southeastern U.S. 'tick belt,' the lone star tick is now found further west and north, such as in the wealthy Long Island enclave . McGintee said she currently knows of around 70 cases and sees more every week. Unfortunately, there continues to be scepticism  regarding the what exactly causes the reactions. Most allergic reactions are immediate, which means people aren’t always able to identify the cause of their symptoms, much less trace them back to a tick bite that could have occurred been months prior. Confusion: Reactions and triggers vary, making diagnosis difficult. Unlike other food allergies, the meat reaction occurs hours after consumption. And the allergy itself may not begin until long after contact with the tiny tick . The good news: Thankfully, contacts with the vegetarianism-inducing tick can be avoided and scientists think the allergy may fade after years of avoiding subsequent bites . Adding to the confusion is the range . of triggers for the allergy. Some people react more seriously to some . meats than others and some people’s reactions can even be triggered by . something as simple as the gelatin in gelcap vitamins or marshmallows. And even with people like McGintee sounding the alarm, she says ‘There are still a lot of people who don't believe it.’ Despite . the questions and lingering confusion, there is some good news. The . allergy, researchers are finding, seems to fade after years have passed . since the initial trigger so long as recurring tick bites are avoided . and no deaths have thus far been reported.","The Lone Star tick contains a substance that makes people react violently to red meat .
Doctors don't know how long the allergy could last, but its increasingly common and becoming more widespread in the United States ."

A baby girl found naked, lying in her own excrement, and close to death in a car boot may have been hidden there since her birth almost two years ago, a court in France has heard. The baby's Portuguese parents face up to ten years in jail for the alleged neglect of the child, who was only found in the car when the mother took the vehicle to a garage in Terrason, central France. The unemployed couple live in Brignac-La-Plaine in the Correze department in France. The baby, thought to be aged between 15 and 23 months, was found by mechanics when they heard 'strange noises that sounded like moans' coming from the woman's car boot. Neglect charges: The parents of a baby girl found close to death in the boot of her mother's car in France are escorted to court, where prosecutors told how car mechanics made the gruesome discovery . Prosecutor Jean-Pierre Laffite said yesterday that it 'defied imagination' that the baby was forced to live in the car boot undetected after the 45-year-old mother woman kept the baby's existence a secret, even from her husband. Mr Laffite said the baby’s condition had stabilised but that she was ‘seriously retarded’. Garage workers were only made aware of the little girl when they heard noises coming from the boot of the mother’s Peugeot 307, according to The Telegraph. Insisting on opening the boot despite the woman's protests they were horrified with what they found. Guillaume Iguacel, one of the mechanics who made the horrible discovery, said: ‘I’m still having trouble . sleeping. 'It was a horrifying sight, seeing this little girl in her own . excrement, not able to hold up her head, white as a sheet.’ Mechanic's shock: The baby - found in her own excrement in the foul-smelling boot after mechanics heard 'strange noises that sounded like moans' - is thought to have been hidden there from birth . The Portuguese couple faces charges relating to depriving the child of care and food, inflicting . habitual voluntary violence on a child under 15-years-old, and concealing a child's existence. Prosecutors said last night that the woman’s claim that the baby’s father, a 40-year-old unemployed builder, was unaware of the baby’s existence was ‘one of several points being checked out by investigators’. The couple were released under strict bail conditions and their names have not been released to protect the identity of their three other children, a girl aged four and two boys, nine and ten. The children are currently being cared for by Correze social workers. The couple are prohibited from entering their house pending further investigations by police. Hid baby's existence: Neighbours of the baby's parents, from French village Birgnac-la-Plaine (pictured), were shocked to learn the shocking news, one saying 'there was never any trace of a baby' Firemen . who spoke to La Montagne newspaper said that the baby's life ‘was at stake . within a time frame of 15 minutes’ when she was discovered. A juvenile judge will make a ruling in . the next few days on the future of the couple’s four children and . whether the two eldest, the boys, can be returned to their parents. Neighbours of the couple were incredulous at news of the discovery. One villager said: ‘They are people like any others and not dirty. ‘I went to their house several times and there was never any trace of a baby. 'I’m still having trouble . sleeping... It was a horrifying sight, seeing this little girl in her own . excrement, not able to hold up her head, white as a sheet' - Guillaume Iguacel, mechanic who found the baby girl . ‘We never noticed that she was pregnant.’ Another neighbour, Pascale, told Le Parisien: ‘We had the impression that this woman lived in her car. She never left it. ‘I recall seeing her several times a week with her car parked in a little lot about 200 metres from her house but we couldn’t see what she was doing in the boot. ‘We never heard a single cry, never saw a bottle or a pushchair.’ The couple’s three other children had attended the local school and appeared normal. According to Sud Ouest newspaper, it was said that the mother had given birth to the baby in a corridor at the couple’s house aided by a neighbour. The man was allegedly drunk when he was . arrested on Friday night and could only be questioned on Saturday after . spending a night in a cell to sober up.

Scientists surveying the sea floor's gas deposits got a surprise when they spotted a crab snacking on frozen bubbles of methane streaming from a vent, which it mistook for food. They spotted the hungry arthropod while exploring methane gas deposits off the coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia. The deep sea crab scavenges for its meals by tracking vibrations created by movement and sound and was consequently attracted to the stream of bubbles. Scroll down for video . Scientists surveying the sea floor's gas deposits got a surprise when they spotted a crab snacking on frozen bubbles of methane, which collected round its mouth to form a moustache . The icy bubbles might have seemed like a suitable snack to the crab, but froze onto its claws and mouth, creating an amusing moustache. Scientists from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) caught the crab snacking and filmed the arthropod from a remotely operated vehicle offshore of Canada. The underwater site situated just off Vancouver Island has naturally occurring methane vents where gas bubbles  emerge from the sea floor, Peter Walz, an MBARI research technician told Becky Oskin at Live Science. 'It was pretty obvious that the crab was intent on going to the gas vent, but we had no idea what he was going to do or why. 'The crab was doing his own investigation of what we were investigating,' he said. The creature used its claws to 'catch' bubbles of gas and push them into its mouth. Its moustache formed because of the cold temperature of the bubbles and high pressure of the methane on the seas floor. When the gas escapes around 1,260 metres below sea level, the bubbles have a frozen skin - methane hydrate - with the gas trapped inside the icy layer. According to Mr Walz, the skin of the bubbles formed a layer on the crab's claws as when the crab moved them in the stream of bubbles, the gas turned to methane hydrate and stuck to the creature, which also transferred the substance to its mouth. He told Live Science: 'The hydrate forms more readily with increased agitation or shaking, such as the movements of the crab.' The hungry creature used its claws to 'catch' bubbles of gas and push them into its mouth. Its moustache formed because the cold temperature of the bubbles and high pressure of the methane on the seas floor . The animal eventually scraped off the methane hydrate and scuttled away, leaving the distracted scientists to study the Bullseye Vent, which they had come to do in the first place. As well as studying the strange behaviour of the crab, they found large pockets of the gas can change the shape of the seafloor. Peter Brewer, senior scientist at MBARI, said the video illustrates the unusual property of hydrocarbon gas behaviour under the extreme pressure and cold temperatures. The scientists believe it also serves as an example of how organisms living on the seafloor might interact with naturally occurring hydrocarbons.

The battle over national health care is costing President Obama in the polls as he now has his lowest approval rating of his presidency. A new poll put out by NBC and the Wall Street Journal reveals that only 42 per cent of the country approves of the President's job performance. That approval rating is five points lower than it was earlier this month in the heat of the government shutdown following the budget battle. Showing that the federal problems are overflowing into uncharted territory, the new poll reveals that the President's personal approval ratings have flipped from their normal stance- where more Americans like him as a person than those who dislike him. Now 41 per cent of respondents view him favorably and 45 per cent see him in a negative light. Feeling the heat: President Obama's approval rating dropped to its lowest-ever point of 22 per cent while 51 per cent of Americans disapprove of his job performance (which is tied for his highest score ever) Still got some fans: President Obama signs Cathey Park's cast at an event in Boston on Wednesday . Signing off: The President signed the cast as he gave his latest speech in support of the Affordable Care Act . 'Personally and politically, the public’s assessment is two thumbs down,' pollster Peter Hart told NBC. President Obama: 22 per cent approves of his job performance, 51 per cent disapproves . - 41 per cent view him favorably and 45 per cent sees him in a negative light . Congress: 74 per cent think Congress is causing more problems than they are solving . Republicans: 22 per cent approve of their job performance and 53 per cent disapprove . The shutdown: 38 per cent blame Republicans, 23 per cent blame Democrats, and 36 per cent feel that both parties are equally responsible . The negative responses were not limited . to the President, however, as the Republican party in general was met . with an all-time-low of 22 per cent approval and 53 per cent . disapproval. Nearly three-quarters of the respondents said that Congress was causing more problems than solving them. Just slightly more than one-fifth (22 per cent) of the country thinks we're headed in the right direction and half of all respondents think that another government shutdown is inevitable. And finally, 63 per cent of respondents want to vote their Congressional representative out of office. That particular question has been regularly asked in polls over the past decade an the latest response is the highest ever. President Obama's disapproval rating- which measures the portion of the country who actively believes that the President is doing a poor job- came in at 51 per cent. Both in the hot seat: President Obama and the Democrats are not the only ones in trouble as the Republicans, headed by John Boehner, also reached their lowest approval rating . 'Unpopular': The poll reveals that House Speaker John Boehner (left), Senate Majority leader Harry Reid (center) and Senate Minority leader Mitch McConnell (right) are all viewed in a negative light . This is the second time that his unfavorables have reached that high since he took office in 2009. Talk . of fallout from the 16-day government shutdown earlier this month was a . constant concern during the negotiations, and it seems that the fact . that Democrats came out just slightly less-hated than Republicans has . begun to fade. More Americans- 38 per cent- blame Republicans for the shutdown as opposed to Democrats- who are seen as the cause by 23 per cent of respondents- but there is still a sizable group- 36 per cent- who think both were to blame. Pollsters explained that there was no one single problem cited by respondents, but rather it is a result of numerous issues. In addition to the ongoing health insurance roll out and postponed budget battles, longer-lasting controversies like the NSA spying and the handling of the chemical weapons attack in Syria. Looming: Half of respondents said that they felt there would be another government shutdown .","President Obama now has the lowest professional and personal approval ratings of his presidency .

As more and more people are becoming obese, a council has resorted to expanding the size of its graves to accommodate bigger bodies. Rochford Council in Essex, where more than a quarter of the adult population is classified as obese, has agreed to expand average grave sizes by 10 per cent in a bid to cater for larger bodies. The town suffers from above average adult obesity rates and some cemeteries have already struggled to fit some larger coffins into the 9ft by 4ft graves currently provided. Expanding: Rochester Council is digging larger graves in its cemeteries to accommodate bigger bodies . Keith Gordon, Rochford councillor responsible for environment and leisure, said: 'The plots have been increased in size to give everybody a chance. 'The actual graves are getting bigger, as you can appreciate, because some people are getting larger. 'I think it’s something that’s been noticed by councils all over the place, that people are getting bigger.' It comes after many undertakers started providing the option of 'super-size coffins' for larger bodies. Some funeral parlours in Britain have even had to install hoists capable of lifting . 50 stone, purchase reinforced steel trollies and increase the size of their fridges in order to manage larger corpses. Hospital morgues and crematoriums have . already had to make alterations to deal with the changes, such as . installing extra-large furnaces. Wide: Larger coffins that are needed to house obese bodies . While a standard casket typically . measures between 24 and 27 inches wide, manufacturers are now producing . boxes as wide as 52 inches, capable of fitting a person weighing up to . 1,000 pounds. The move comes despite a shortage of space in graveyards across the country which has led to councils considering ‘reusing’ old grave sites. Experts have labeled the space . shortage a crisis with a recent survey revealing some councils could run . out of burial space within the next 20 years. Mr . Gordon went onto explain that two plots can be bought to accommodate . extremely large coffins although a two foot separation between graves is . needed to prevent collapse. He added: 'You can end up with a collapse if you’re not careful, I think that’s uppermost in people’s minds.' Wide load: Obesity is forcing ambulance bosses to revamp their fleets to cope with obese patients . Among the improvements are specially-strengthened stretchers capable of expanding to take extra weight and motorised stretchers to help staff lift heavy patients . Ambulance bosses have also started paying out millions to ‘supersize’ their vehicles to cope with the growing number of obese casualties. The . East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) is to introduce a fleet of 128 . larger ambulances, each capable of dealing with patients who weigh up to . 55st. Its fleet of bigger vehicles, known as ‘bariatric ambulances’, have larger doors and more space inside. They have also been fitted with . specially-strengthened stretchers capable of expanding to take extra . weight, motorised stretchers to help staff lift heavy patients, wider ramps and larger chairs. Statistics released by Public Health . England in September 2013 showed 24.2 per cent of England’s adult . population suffer from obesity.

Former First Daughter, Jenna Bush Hager celebrated Halloween by dressing up her five-month old daughter in an astronaut costume. Her dad, former President George W. Bush was seen holding little Mila in a cute NASA outfit. Jenna tweeted that her father was discussing astronomy with the baby girl. Space baby: Former President George W. Bush holds his granddaughter Mila who is dressed up in an adorable NASA spacesuit for Halloween . For the former President, it will almost certainly have brought back fond memories of his time in office. President Bush championed NASA and its technologies unveiling a new vision for space exploration back in 2004, calling on NASA to 'gain a new foothold on the moon and to prepare for new journeys to the worlds beyond our own.' Had the funding for the Space Program not been slashed by President Obama, a planned mission to the moon would have been ready for launch next year. He'll instead have to keep his dreams invested in his granddaughter and enjoy playing space cadets here on Rarth. After conducting a space walk with the rookie, it was time to hand control of the mission to former First Lady Laura Bush as she took little Mila on a walk on the outdoor patio. Given the Halloween festivities it looks as though it was treats all-round for the family. Mission control: Former First Lady Laura Bush took over duties looking after baby Mila as the two took a walk outside . Meanwhile, the current President and First Lady greeted adorable children at the White House in the annual festivities. The revellry was a bit more ghoulish in New York, as the 40th annual Greenwich Village Parade returned to the city after a year off in 2012 because of the damage that happened during Hurricane Sandy. While the parade that rolled up New York's Sixth Avenue was made up largely of adults given the later start time, the White House party was all about the kids. The fake insects could be seen slithering down from the Truman Balcony along the South Portico, where haystacks and nearly 200 pumpkins dotted the lawn for the annual White House Halloween event.

More than 5,000 people took part in this year's event, the White House said. One of the biggest annual parades wrapped up in New York City's Greenwich Village at around 11pm. The final headcount for the storied mile-long celebration has not been reported but there were no major police incidents. The official number of arrests will not be reported until around 2am local time. This was the parade's 40th year and it was expected to be extra raucous because it was cancelled last year due to Hurricane Sandy. The superstorm hit the North East- badly damaging parts of New York City- just days before Halloween so officials made the decision not to redirect police services from rescue operations to security at the parade route.

Attack of the living dead: A crowd of zombies got into the spirit . Enjoying the night: The parade was cancelled last year due to Hurricane Sandy . Because of the money lost by cancelling the parade at the last minute after the storm, the organizers had no money left to fund the event. 'We asked for grants, we hoped the Bloomberg foundation would give us some money, but nothing was happening,' organizer Jeanne Fleming told the Associated Press. They were saved by a Kickstarter campaign that raised $55,000 and let the show go on. Additional help came from sympathetic business owners, like those who gave them discounted insurance rates.

The body of a missing Pakistani-born model has been found dumped in a ditch out the outskirts of Islamabad. Fehmina Chaudhry, 27, based in Singapore, disappeared last Thursday while visiting her home country to buy property, local police said. Estate agent Maaz Waqar has confessed to the murder of supermodel mother-of-two, originally from Karachi, and is in police custody. Model death: Beauty queen Fehmina Chaudhry, 27, was found murdered on Tuesday after she had allegedly been kidnapped and held at ransom in Islamabad . Chaudhry went missing last week, after which her mother received demands for money in return for her daughter. Islamabad police tracked down Mr Waqar, who admitted to murdering the beauty queen after interrogation. ‘Police arrested the real estate broker and after interrogation, he told officers that he had murdered the model and dumped her body in a stream at the outskirts of the city,’ Islamabad police spokesman Muhammad Naeem said. Miss Chaudhry's promoter in Pakistan, Asif Hashmi, confirmed the death of the model, who was married with a son and a daughter. Mystery: Ms Chaudhry, originally from Karachi, now based in Singapore, had been visiting Islamabad to look at real estate when she disappeared . ‘She was a dedicated philanthropist and she was planning to set up a fashion school in Pakistan,’ Hashmi said, adding that she had won several beauty contests. The officer leading the investigation, Yasir Afridi, said Chaudhry's mother had contacted her for the last time on the evening of October 10, after which she received a text message saying her daughter had been kidnapped. ‘She used to visit Pakistan often to see her mother and was staying at a private hotel in Islamabad where she came to buy real estate for her mother,’ Yasir said.","Fehmina Chaudhry was kidnapped as she looked for property in Islamabad .

The BBC has been accused of wasting the licence fee on ‘boozy farewells’ for its staff after it emerged that it spent more than £2million on food and drink last year. Figures show the BBC spent £42,971 on alcohol and another £33,745 on leaving parties. The corporation ordered in more than 13,000 bottles of wine and 11,000 bottles of beer and cider to fuel a series of celebratory drinks parties and ‘ad hoc team parties’. Another £1,655 was spent on spirits – including 31 bottles of Smirnoff vodka, 15 bottles of Bombay Sapphire gin and a bottle of ten-year-old Isle of Jura whisky. In 2008, it was reported that the corporation had introduced a champagne ban. But last year it splashed out £4,673 on sparkling wine instead. And the food and drink bill shows that the BBC is spending more than £1,000 a day providing free tea and coffee to its staff. In total, the spend on hot drinks increased by around 60 per cent in a year. Another £1.3million was spent subsidising canteens to allow staff to eat cheaply at work, while £293,000 was spent on water dispensers. The figures, released under the Freedom of Information Act, also revealed that staff claimed £3.2million in expenses for meals and drinks when they were not in the office, as well as £187,000 for business entertaining. The expenditure appears at odds with the BBC’s drive to reduce costs, which has resulted in deep cuts to programme budgets and thousands of job losses in recent years. Some £1,655 was spent on spirits – including . 31 bottles of Smirnoff vodka, 15 bottles of Bombay Sapphire gin and a . bottle of ten-year-old Isle of Jura whisky . And the news comes as it faces a scandal over its generosity to departing staff after last month’s revelation that it handed £369million in severance deals in eight years. Yesterday Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘The licence fee should be spent on quality programming, not boozy farewells for departing staff. ‘BBC bosses should focus on reducing the burden funding the broadcaster places on families by ensuring it provided better value for money. That means spending less on subsidised wining and dining.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘We are mindful of our obligation to the licence-fee payer when purchasing food and drink and the BBC has tight guidelines that govern the occasions when alcohol may be bought.’","BBC spent £42,971 on alcohol and another £33,745 on leaving parties .

Katie Hopkins has sparked widespread outrage by mocking the short life expectancy in Scotland just a day after the Glasgow helicopter crash. The former Apprentice star tweeted: 'Life expectancy in Scotland is 59.5. Goodness me. That lot will do anything to avoid working until retirement.' Thousands of web users were offended by the joke, which came the day after a helicopter crashed through the roof of the Clutha pub, killing nine and injuring dozens more. Ms Hopkins initially refused to apologise, instead mocking those who expressed anger, but she has now backed down and admitted the quip was 'terribly ill timed'. Thousands of people have now signed a petition calling for her to be taken off the air by television bosses. The TV personality is well-known as a controversialist, appearing on programmes such as This Morning to give her views on topics such as bad parenting and political correctness. On her Twitter feed, she rails against aspects of modern life in short messages to her 82,000 followers. The tweet about Scotland referred to an official document detailing life expectancy trends across the country - although 59.5 is in fact the 'healthy' life expectancy for Scottish men, not the total figure. As soon Ms Hopkins' message was published on Saturday, other Twitter fans started to suggest that it was in poor taste given the Clutha disaster which happened on Friday night. Controversy: Ms Hopkins' tweet came just hours after the Glasgow helicopter crash . Apology: The former Apprentice star has backed down over the 'terrible timing' of her tweet . Several people accused her of 'racism', while others suggested that she should be reported to the police. The outspoken star started retweeting many of the insults she received, and wrote: 'Yikes, I am being reported to Channel 4 and the BBC. In a moment I will forced to read the Labour manifesto and subscribe to the Guardian.' She added: 'There appear to be a number of conflicting petitions out there to have me hung and quartered. Please do feel free to sign them all. PC tastic'. The most popular petition, 'Remove Katie Hopkins from all programmes and interviews', has attracted 43,000 signatures on Change.org and is directed at producers from ITV and Channel 5. Tragedy: Nine people have died in Glasgow after a helicopter crashed into the Clutha pub . It reads: 'On the 30th of November 2013, Scotland was still in shock and trying to come to terms with a horrible crash that took the lives of innocent people. Within 24 hours of this happening Katie Hopkins posted vile remarks on Twitter about how long the people of Scotland live for. 'This is unacceptable and distressing to those who lost friends and family. We the undersigned are sick and tired of ITV and Channel 5 giving her . airtime and want her banned from all TV shows on your channels such as . This Morning and The Wright Stuff. 'This woman is nothing more than an attention seeker who does not deserve to be a celebrity.' Ms Hopkins finally apologised for the tweet today, saying that it was only intended to relate to the official document and adding: 'I apologise to those I offended. It was poor timing.' She continued: 'The timing was terrible. I apologise to everyone. xx'","Controversial TV personality wrote: 'Life expectancy in Scotland is 59.5. Goodness me.

Opposition fighters and civilians posed . among the rubble of the northern city and clutched flags and signs . featuring messages of defiance against President Bashar Assad's regime. Militants captured security forces in public squares and have driven their bodies through the streets. They have posted guards at state buildings, returned soaring bread prices to pre-war levels and set up a hotline for residents to phone to report security issues, anti-regime activists said. Raqqa is shaping up to be the best test case yet for how opposition fighters will administer territory amid western concerns over who will fill the vacuum if President Assad is ousted. Death toll: The conflict has lasted two-years, with an estimated 70,000 people killed and countless wounded .

Caught in the fighting: A mother and her children remained in the city despite the conflict . The conflict has lasted two-years, with an estimated 70,000 people killed and countless wounded. A a top Sunni preacher, who was a staunch supporter of the regime, was among those killed in the bombing in Damascus last night. The bomber blew himself up inside a mosque in the heart of the capital, killing Sheikh Mohammad Said Ramadan al-Buti as he was giving a sermon, and wounding more than 80 others. In a statement carried by Syria's state SUNA news agency, Preisdent Assad said al-Buti represented true Islam. He said: 'Your blood and your grandson's, as well as that of all the nation's martyrs will not go in vain because we will continue to follow your thinking to wipe out their darkness and clear our country of them.' Earlier this week, Syria's main opposition group demanded a full international investigation into an alleged chemical weapons attack in the north of the country. The Syrian National Coalition has blamed government forces and called for a team to be sent to the village of Khan al-Assal in Aleppo province, where the missile attack reportedly occurred. Split: Raqqa's new rulers are struggling with the same divisions that have hampered the rebel movement . Finger pointing: The rebels and regime have traded accusations about a chemical attack in Khan al-Assal .

'Its use against any . enemy is banned, however all evidence now indicates that the Assad . regime is using these weapons against its own people.' A U.S. official said there is no evidence that chemical weapons were used but a senior Israeli minister said it is 'apparently clear' that such weapons have been used, either by rebels of the regime.

He met the parents of . students who were killed in the civil war, state TV reported. It was his first public appearance outside his palace since January. Activists have reported violence around the country including clashes in Khan al-Assal, where the chemical attack reportedly occurred, suburbs of the capital and near the Damascus Palestinian refugee camp of Yarmouk. The Aleppo Media Center, an opposition media arm, said rebels shot down a regime warplane in the northern province of Raqqa, whose provincial capital fell in the hands of rebels earlier this month. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said troops were trying to storm the rebel-held neighborhood of Khaldiyeh in the central city of Homs, Syria's third-largest. Rebels have been holding the neighborhood for more than a year. In Lebanon, the state-run National News Agency said five rockets fell on the Lebanese side of the border in the town of al-Qasr. It said there were no casualties. The rockets fell two days after the NNA said Syrian warplanes hit targets along Syria's border with Lebanon. Lebanese President Michel Suleiman strongly condemned the air raid while the Foreign Ministry in Damascus denied Syrian aircraft bombarded Lebanon.

Scroll down for video . Mysterious: Mourners at Sutton Road Cemetery in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, have been astounded by the phenomenon - with the caterpillars crawling along dozens of gravestones, benches and trees. Unusual sight: The bird cherry Ermine moth caterpillars, which have created web-like nests and left the graveyard with a ghostly white appearance, even hang from the trees on thin strands of their silken threads . Habitat: In their caterpillar stage, the bugs, known as web worms, weave leaves of trees together . There are no plans to remove the . caterpillars, known as 'web worms', because they do not cause any damage . to the headstones and benches. Julia . Heath, 42, who was left stunned when she visited the graveyard to lay . flowers, said: ‘It really is quite a sight - I don’t think I have ever . seen anything quite like this before. The bird cherry Ermine moth is entirely harmless - unlike many other caterpillars that cause infestations. They can be found across  Europe as well as in northern and eastern Asia. Ranging in size from 0.6 to 1in, they live on bird cherry trees and make an extensive web-like nest. They can eat an entire tree bare although many trees survive with reduced growth in the following growth seasons. In 2011, 20 matures trees disappeared under a web of white silk in Birmingham when they experienced an infestation. Experts . say there are often outbreaks in areas with a group of bird cherry . trees - which are quite rare in England, compared to Scotland. It . is not thought year-on-year climate variations affect the numbers of . caterpillars - but it is believed the rise in reports of recent . outbreaks may be simply because people are noticing the webs more, . following increased publicity. It is not for the faint-hearted because the caterpillars look like maggots or worms which really could make your stomach turn. 'But . there is something quite beautiful too in the way they create the . ghostly white webs that hang from the trees. It would be the perfect . setting for a scene from a horror movie - it reminds me of Tim Burton . films like Sleepy Hollow.' Following a similar phenomenon at the cemetery this time three years ago - which was also  reported by MailOnline - Southend Museum's natural history curator Roger Payne had said the caterpillars would emerge as moths in July. The invasion is not the only of its kind seen this month. As reported last Thursday, a plague of the same bugs has covered pavements, walls and cars in Hampton, south-west London. Today, Mr Payne told MailOnline: ‘Maybe they have received a bit of publicity recently and people are noticing them a bit more. 'Sometimes . you get really specific outbreaks and people notice. Often people see a . tree covered in webbing and think that is unusual and could be spiders. They don't really connect it with thousands and thousands of small . caterpillars. ‘I don't think the climate affects . them very much. It just so happens that somebody long ago thought they would . plant bird cherry trees at the cemetery - and this is an unlimited . supply. ‘It's probably a migrant moth that . laid a few eggs there years ago. It's not a common tree around here in . the South. The only thing that knocks them back a bit are wasp parasites. ‘So that is the main way in which the . population is controlled, because birds don't seem to touch them - I . suspect because they don't taste very nice. The web does offer some sort . of protection.’ Webs: There are no plans to remove the caterpillars because they do not cause any damage to the area .

Road rage killer Tracie Andrews has set up home with a married father-of-four who ditched his wife for her. Two years after she was released from prison for stabbing her fiance Lee Harvey 42 times, she is pictured with new lover Phil Goldsworthy, 52. Now calling herself Jenna Stephens and with her appearance changed by dark hair and plastic surgery, Andrews is reportedly playing housewife at the home he shared with his wife, Linsie, in South West England. Killer Tracie Andrews, who stabbed her boyfriend to death and blamed it on a road-rage stranger, has moved in with a father-of-four who allegedly dumped his wife for her. Killer Tracie Andrews and boyfriend Phil Goldsworthy were spotted holding hands as they strolled round the shops . Andrews, 44, completed jobs around the . 52-year-old's semi-detached house near St Ives, Cornwall, before she . headed out with him to do a spot of shopping, the Sunday Mirror reported. Despite being sentenced to life imprisonment in 1997 for the murder of Lee Harvey, Andrews was released on licence after just 14 years in 2011. Her aim then was to slip back into the community unnoticed and she has tried to build up a new life after her horrific crime. She not only changed her name but also attempted to change her appearance. Phil Goldsworthy is currently divorcing his wife Linsie and has moved in with the cold-hearted killer who stabbed her fiance 42 times with a penknife . Tracie Andrews claimed her boyfriend had been murdered by a stranger . This included a £5,000 operation, paid . for by the NHS, to correct her distinctive protruding jaw. Her mane of . blonde hair also disappeared and was replaced by a dyed black bob. And it would appear that she has formed a new life for herself as she settled into Mr Goldsworthy's home. Mrs Goldsworthy, a mother-of-two, has previously bitterly accused Andrews of being involved in the breakdown of their relationship. She claimed Andrews showered Mr Goldsworthy with gifts, and described how they became close while working together. Last year Mrs Goldsworthy said her husband was 'fascinated' by the cold-hearted killer. 'If we went out with friends, he would say excitedly: ""Guess who’s working at the pub? The woman who stabbed her boyfriend to death"",' she said. 'He would defend her from any criticism, claiming she had changed. 'He used to say she looked like Kat Slater from EastEnders — and he has always fancied her. 'Then he started coming home from the pub at 4am, claiming they were really busy.' After the discovery of a text message between the pair, says Mrs Goldsworthy, she and her husband split up. Andrews stabbed Lee with a penknife 42 times during a violent row. Despite forensic evidence confirming her guilt, she denied the charges at trial . But Mr Goldsworthy has insisted his estranged wife's version of events was ‘all lies’ and that he and his wife broke up before Andrews came on the scene. Andrews tried to convince the nation of her innocence when she gave an interview at a press conference. Occasionally weeping and sporting buises, Andrews clutched Lee's mother Maureen’s hand as she described how a road-rage assailant stabbed 25-year-old Lee following a cat-and-mouse car chase through Worcestershire as the couple drove home from the pub. But her recollection was revealed to be a complete lie. Jealous, possessive and volatile, Andrews had stabbed Lee with a penknife 42 times during a violent row. Despite forensic evidence confirming her guilt, she denied the charges at trial. It was only 21 months after she was convicted that she confessed to killing Lee, claiming self-defence, in a letter to her solicitor, despite Lee sustaining a stab wound to his back.","Held hands with Phil Goldsworthy as they strolled through shops .

All mothers will have heard tut-tutting at the school gates about those children who 'get away with murder'. At the same time, we worry that our own tantrum-prone toddler  is suffering from autism - as one in 100 does - or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Of course, when it's not your own child, it's easy to see these as an excuse for bad parenting. The expulsion from school of five-year-old Harry Reid demonstrated both sides of this coin. While his mother believes autism and ADHD cause his disruptive behaviour, one teacher was said to have called him the naughtiest child she had ever met. Sadly, everyone involved was struggling to deal with this case. Roald Dahl's famously bratty Veruca Salt could have had a medical condition . There is a knee-jerk tendency to claim that doctors are bent on giving every stroppy child a 'chemical cosh' - but this is simply not true. Sometimes, naughtiness genuinely is the symptom of a medical condition. And recognising that is the key  to getting a child help. Being defiant and testing boundaries is just a normal part of growing up. Isn't it counterproductive to classify a child as ill? Of course children have a range of personalities and it is to be expected that some will push boundaries far more than others. Moreover,  all children go through phases, whether they are two-year-olds or teenagers, when they defy authority. This is completely natural. This kind of behaviour can also be a reaction to problems in their environment - is there something distressing going on at home or school, for example? The mental health of children and adolescents is a complex field and the best general advice I can give is to be watchful, without worrying or being overbearing. However, alarm bells should ring when a child's behaviour goes far beyond that of his or her contemporaries, and continues to a point where life at home and at school is persistently being disrupted. In that case, it is absolutely worth speaking to a doctor, as this behaviour could indeed be symptomatic of a medical condition. Debbie Reid and son Harry who has been excluded from his primary school . What kind of medical conditions are we talking about? Today, we believe that up to five per cent of children have ADHD. This diagnosis is made when a child shows a specific set of symptoms that include inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness. It is generally thought to be down to brain function and anatomy, and the condition often runs in families. One possible cause is the mother drinking alcohol and smoking during pregnancy; another is the child watching too much TV. Two-thirds of children with ADHD still have problems as teenagers, and the same proportion continue to suffer as adults. ADHD can often go hand-in-hand with learning disabilities and sleep problems. It is, however, by no means the only cause of disruptive behaviour. What we traditionally think of as autism is often diagnosed before a child begins education, but it is only part of the range of illnesses known as Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD), any of which may cause what looks like naughtiness. In a child with a mild ASD, the symptoms may have been subtle before starting school, or the classroom setting may actually bring out new, previously unseen symptoms. Other health problems such as deafness and epilepsy can also be manifested as difficult behaviour before they are diagnosed. So why are we suddenly giving children these labels - and medicating them - when the conditions used not to exist? We are more aware nowadays of all learning and mental health problems in children. And this awareness is a positive step towards educating and supporting children who may previously have been disregarded by schools. The fact that these conditions are newly defined does not mean we invented them for the sake of it. While many children  are restless from time to time, a child with ADHD is persistently restless and can't concentrate in any situation. These diagnoses are not made in a brief consultation. Information is gathered from the youngster's school and GP, as well as observing him or her in different settings performing different tasks. The features of ADHD have to have been present for more than six months for a diagnosis to be made.On the other hand, children with ASD primarily find social situations difficult. They have trouble understanding other people's emotions, so, for example, may carry on 'misbehaving' even when someone is upset or angry with them. Children with ASD like routine and can express anger and aggression when these are changed. They often cannot understand non-verbal cues such as tone of voice or facial expression, while they can be blunt when talking, which gets them into trouble. Isn't it ludicrous to expect a mainstream school to cope with a child with extreme behaviour even if there is a medical cause for it? If a diagnosis has been made, it is not unreasonable that a school should try to cope. All children with special needs should be 'statemented'. This means a statement of educational need is made and the child is then provided with a plan to meet those needs. They should be assisted within the classroom, which often involves one-to-one help. Properly organised and funded intervention can have a very positive effect. Once a diagnosis is established and a proper plan has been put in place, mainstream schools can cope very well. The diagnosis of a disorder means that parents, teachers and children can be taught how to avoid triggers and manage problem behaviour. How can I get help for my child if  his or her naughtiness does appear  to be excessive? A proper assessment is vital. This can start with a chat with your GP, who may suggest that a formal examination needs to be made by a community paediatric team, which includes an educational psychologist. In some cases the school will actually initiate this. Once a child has been assessed, the appropriate measures should be put in place at the school, whether that is help from a classroom assistant or extra one-to-one care. This should occur in conjunction with therapy or medication for the child, as well as a parent training programme to teach effective communication and the skills required to deal with difficult behaviour.","It is believed that up to five per cent of children have ADHD .

Motoring chain-store Halfords has been criticised by road safety groups for selling key rings apparently promoting drink driving. The stocking-fillers are being sold at several stores across the UK with slogans such as 'M1NE5 A P1NT' and 'W4STED' on them. Ellen Booth, senior campaigns officer for . road safety charity Brake, said they send out 'a very irresponsible message'. Halfords have been criticised for selling key rings that seem to promote drink driving at the same time as police are trying to crack down on the illegal activity during the festive season . Motoring groups have called the £1.99 items 'silly' and 'irresponsible' and are asking people not to buy them . 'They make light of a serious problem on UK roads - traffic is the biggest killer of young people. 'A combination of age and inexperience, means that young drivers are hugely overrepresented in road crashes. She stressed it's particularly important to send out the right messages to young drivers as they are more likely to take risks and are less able to deal with the consequences of the risks. 'That’s why it’s so important that we . send out the right messages to young drivers - that risk taking on roads . is deadly serious. 'It could cost your health or even your life if you take risks like speeding or drinking alcohol or taking drugs and driving.' Hundreds of people are killed while drink driving each year, with 230 fatalities recorded in 2011 alone. Pam Hatton, 42, said she was shocked when she saw the key rings in one of Halford's stores. They were spotted in Cardiff store but are sold in many of the motoring chain's other stores. 'I . couldn’t believe it,' she said. 'I can’t believe a responsible company . would be so stupid as to encourage this kind of behaviour. 'Don’t they know how many people die every year because of drink driving?'' Neil Greig, director of policy for the Institute of Advanced Motorists said: 'These are silly gifts for silly people. 'Clearly . these keyrings are totally out of touch with most people’s views on . driving - sadly safety messages aren’t seen as being as cool as this . sort of thing. They can’t be banned, so our simple message is don’t buy . one. Andrew Misell, director of Alcohol Concern, also criticised the key rings: 'Alcohol and cars just don’t mix, . 'Obviously . these key rings are supposed to be a bit of a laugh, but I doubt anyone . who’s suffered as a result of drink driving will see the funny side.' The novelty items, which Halfords described as 'fun', were on display with Christmas products at the checkout . The key chains were seen on display at the motoring chain's Cardiff store (pictured), but were also thought to be on sale in stores across the UK . The Government advises that any amount of alcohol affects your ability to drive and say 'it’s better to have none for the road'. A conviction for drink driving can lead to a fine of £5,000, a minimum 12-month driving ban and a criminal record. The Institute of Advanced Motorists say being caught drink driving could cost between £20,000 and £50,000 in fines, solicitors fees, increase in car insurance and loss of job. A Halfords spokesman said: 'We take the issues of road safety and drink driving very seriously. Our consistent and strong advice to motorists is not to drink and drive. 'The keyrings are popular with our customers who see them as a fun item and the slogans are not meant to encourage irresponsible driving at all.

American Airlines and US Airways have reached a deal with the government that lets the two form the world's biggest airline . A judge refused to block a merger between American Airlines and US Airways on Saturday evening, saying a bankruptcy judge correctly rejected arguments made by a lawyer for some consumers. San Francisco attorney Joseph Alioto argued that the deal would harm fliers because it would result in less competition and higher prices. U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska repeatedly noted that his arguments relied on outdated facts, had no evidence to support them and sometimes made no sense. The New American Airlines: US Airways and American Airlines officials plan to sign the papers to make the marriage final, prior to the start of market trading Monday . Cleared for takeoff: US Airways CEO Doug Parker, who becomes American Airlines Group CEO on Monday, will ring the opening bell for NASDAQ as the new stock symbol, AAL, starts trading . One happy family: American Airlines and US Airways are set to combine to become the world's biggest airline . 'There is nothing in the record from . which I can make a finding that your clients are likely to be . irreparably injured -- personally,' she said. American . is owned by AMR Corp. and is based in Fort Worth, Texas. The company . has said it plans to complete the merger with Tempe, Ariz.-based US . Airways on Monday. Preska . said a federal bankruptcy judge was 'correct in all respects' in . deciding last week to let the merger proceed. She also refused to stay . the effect of her ruling while Alioto appeals to the 2nd U.S. Circuit . Court of Appeals. Alioto complained Friday to Preska that he'd gotten 'the bum's rush, with all due respect, by the bankruptcy court.' Deal: Under the proposal, American and US Airways would sell 104 takeoff and landing slots at Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington, 34 slots at La Guardia Airport in New York . Preska . said Alioto had failed to show consumers would suffer irreparable harm . or that he was likely to succeed in his effort to temporarily block the . merger until a trial could be conducted on his antitrust lawsuit. Lane . said last week that even if Alioto won his lawsuit, he could demand . additional divestitures by the two airlines but could not wreck the . merger. Alioto's case lacked . proof, said Attorney Dan Wall for US Airways Group Inc. 'We're here on . just attorney argument and rhetoric,' he said . The . merger means American, United, Delta and Southwest will control more . than 80 per cent of the U.S. market. A series of mergers in the industry . since 2005 has reduced nine big airlines to four . In August, the Justice Department had sued to block the merger, saying it would hurt competition and produce higher prices. But regulators settled their case in exchange for the airlines' promise to surrender some coveted landing rights at Reagan National near Washington and LaGuardia in New York and a few gates at five other airports. Competing . low-cost carriers will also be given more access to airports in Boston, . Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles and Miami, the government said. 'This . is very good news and we are grateful to all who have made it happen,' said Doug Parker, CEO of US Airways, and incoming CEO of the combined . airline, which will be based in Dallas/Fort Worth and go by the . American name. 'We are pleased to have this lawsuit behind us and look forward to building the new American Airlines together.' Under the terms of the settlement, the airlines will divest 52 slot pairs at Reagan and 17 slot pairs at LaGuardia. The airlines will also surrender two gates each at Boston's Logan airport, O'Hare, Dallas Love Field, Los Angeles and Miami. 'It provides more competition than exists today in this industry,' Baer said. 'That is good news for consumers all across the country who will benefit from more choices and more competitive airfares.' What next: The settlement still needs to be approved by the Federal District Court in the District of Columbia as well as a judge overseeing American Airlines¿ bankruptcy proceeding. The merger could deal could be done by mid-December . After completion of the required divestitures, the combined company expects to operate 44 fewer daily departures at Reagan and 12 fewer daily departures at LaGuardia than the approximately 290 daily DCA departures and 175 daily LGA departures that American and US Airways operate today. Parker said the combined airline must still decide which destinations to drop because of the lost slots at Reagan and LaGuardia. But he said they would be announced with enough time for the airlines that acquire the slots to decide whether to continue serving those communities. 'We do indeed serve some communities that it is unlikely will be served by those that pick up these slots,' Parker said. Tom Horton, CEO of American, said the loss of slots is relatively modest, totaling about 15% of the combined airlines' slots at Reagan and 7% at LaGuardia. But the airlines said the changes wouldn't reduce total employment at the new company. 'This is an important day for our customers, our people and our financial stakeholders,' Horton said. 'This agreement allows us to take the final steps in creating the new American Airlines.' Saving the day: America West bought out US Airways in 2005. The airline was days away from being liquidated. America West CEO Doug Parker headed up the new airline, a post he still has to this day and will continue with the new American Airlines . End result: After completion of the divestitures, the combined carrier expects to operate 44 fewer daily departures at DCA and 12 fewer daily departures at LGA. Today, the airlines operate 290 and 175 flights respectively at those airports . To maintain its service to small and medium-size airports that US Airways warned might suffer from a reduction in slots at Reagan and LaGuardia, the combined company announced plans to use its gates at Reagan to serve those communities. Another part of the settlement also committed the combined American to maintain its hubs in Charlotte, New York's JFK, Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago O'Hare, Philadelphia and Phoenix. For a period of five years, the merged company will continue daily service from those hubs to each of the states participating in the lawsuit: Arizona, Florida, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Tennessee and Virginia. Delta Air Lines issued a statement welcoming the agreement and saying the airline 'looks forward to the opportunity to acquire slots that will be divested under the agreement, particularly at Washington-Reagan National Airport.' Delta said it is the airline best positioned to continue competitive non-stop flights from Reagan to small and midsize cities that could otherwise see service reduced or eliminated.

Mosques will take the unprecedented step of urging British Muslims to 'wear the poppy, rather than burn it' this week in a bid to counter claims of being unpatriotic. Poppy stalls will be set up at around the country leading up to Remembrance Sunday in a move backed by government ministers and the Royal British Legion.

Woolwich barracks in south-east London. Members of Muslims Against Crusaders burning a large poppy at a protest in Kensington, west London, in 2010 . Britain's Islamic leaders fear that actions by a minority of extremists have led to a perception amongst some that Muslims are 'unpatriotic' or 'disloyal'. One example was a protest held in November 2010 when fanatics set fire to a giant paper poppy outside the Albert Hall in central London. In a bid to tackle that negative perception, the centenary of the First World War next year will be used to highlight that thousands of Muslim soldiers have fought and died for Britain, The Sunday Times reported. Tomorrow the communities secretary Eric Pickles is expected to visit a Muslim-led poppy stall outside Westminster Cathedral in Central London. Stalls will also operate at different locations in the capital this week run by the interfaith charity Faiths Forum and at mosques in Leeds, Leicester and Southampton. Julie Siddiqi, the executive director of the Islamic Society of Great Britain, told The Sunday Times: 'British Muslims should be wearing poppies not burning them.' Extremist Anjem Choudary speaks to a group of demonstrators in central London . She added that the centenary of World War One provided an opportunity to tell young Muslims that 'we are all in this together'. 'How can you question a whole community's loyalty when thousands [of their forefathers] died serving this country?' she said. An estimated 400,000 Muslims fought in the war as part of the British Indian Army, including the sepoy Khudadad Khan who was awarded the Victoria Cross for an act of bravery in Belgium in 1914. Historians put numbers of Indians close to 50,000 injured and 8,500 dead on the Western Front during the war. An estimated third to a half of these war-dead were Muslims, who fought and died alongside their fellow Hindu and Sikh countrymen. The bodies of many of these men were never found and their names are listed on the Menin Gate memorial in Ypres, Belgium. More than 3.5million soldiers from the Asian subcontinent fought for Britain in World War One and Two, with tens of thousands killed in action. Referring to both conflicts, Baroness Warsi, minister for faith and communities, said: 'Sikhs, Muslims and Hindus courageously battled and lost their lives for a country they had never seen and for a king who was not from their land.

Dean Griffin liked the health insurance he purchased for himself and his wife three years ago and thought he'd be able to keep the plan even after the federal Affordable Care Act took effect. But the 64-year-old recently received a letter notifying him the plan was being canceled because it didn't cover certain benefits required under the law. The Griffins, who live near Philadelphia, pay $770 monthly for their soon-to-be-terminated health care plan with a $2,500 deductible. Cancelled: Dean and Mary Lou Griffin, of Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, are among millions of people nationwide who buy individual insurance policies and are receiving notices that those policies are being discontinued . The cheapest plan they found on their state insurance exchange was a so-called bronze plan charging a $1,275 monthly premium with deductibles totaling $12,700. It covers only providers in Pennsylvania, so the couple, who live near Delaware, won't be able to see doctors they've used for more than a decade. ‘We're buying insurance that we will never use and can't possibly ever benefit from. We're basically passing on a benefit to other people who are not otherwise able to buy basic insurance,’ said Griffin, who is retired from running an information technology company. The Griffins are among millions of people nationwide who buy individual insurance policies and are receiving notices that those policies are being discontinued because they don't meet the higher benefit requirements of the new law. They can buy different policies directly from insurers for 2014 or sign up for plans on state insurance exchanges. While lower-income people could see lower costs because of government subsidies, many in the middle class may get rude awakenings when they access the websites and realize they'll have to pay significantly more. Frustrated: The plan they found on their state insurance exchange only covers providers in Pennsylvania, so the couple, who live near Delaware, won't be able to see doctors they've used for more than a decade . Those not eligible for subsidies generally receive more comprehensive coverage than they had under their soon-to-be-canceled policies, but they'll have to pay a lot more. Because of the higher cost, the Griffins are considering paying the federal penalty - about $100 or 1 per cent of income next year - rather than buying health insurance. They say they are healthy and don't typically run up large health care costs. Dean Griffin said that will be cheaper because it's unlikely they will get past the nearly $13,000 deductible for the coverage to kick in. Individual health insurance policies are being canceled because the Affordable Care Act requires plans to cover certain benefits, such as maternity care, hospital visits and mental illness. The law also caps annual out-of-pocket costs consumers will pay each year. In the past, consumers could get relatively inexpensive, bare-bones coverage, but those plans will no longer be available. Many consumers are frustrated by what they call forced upgrades as they're pushed into plans with coverage options they don't necessarily want. Ken Davis, who manages a fast food restaurant in Austin, Texas, is recovering from sticker shock after the small-business policy offered by his employer was canceled for the same reasons individual policies are being discontinued. His company pays about $100 monthly for his basic health plan. He said he'll now have to pay $600 monthly for a mid-tier silver plan on the state exchange. The family policy also covers his 8-year-old son. 'Forced upgrades: Many say they feel forced into taking plans through the Obamacare website that they don't need . Even though the federal government is contributing a $500 subsidy, he said the $600 he's left to pay is too high. He's considering the penalty. ‘I feel like they're forcing me to do something that I don't want to do or need to do,’ Davis, 40, said. Owners of canceled policies have a few options. They can stay in the same plan for the same price for one more year if they have one of the few plans that were grandfathered in. They can buy a similar plan with upgraded benefits that meets the new standards - likely at a significant cost increase. Or, if they make less than $45,960 for a single adult or $94,200 for a family of four, they may qualify for subsidies. Just because a policy doesn't comply with the law doesn't mean consumers will get cancellation letters. They may get notices saying existing policies are being amended with new benefits and will come with higher premiums. Some states, including Virginia and Kentucky, required insurers to cancel old policies and start from scratch instead of beefing up existing ones. It's unclear how many individual plans are being canceled - no one agency keeps track. But it's likely in the millions. Advance notice: Dan Mendelson, president of the market analysis firm Avalere Health, says most policyholders in the individual market will receive some notice that their coverage will change . Insurance industry experts estimate that about 14 million people, or 5 per cent of the total market for health care coverage, buy individual policies. Most people get coverage through jobs and aren't affected. Many states require insurers to give consumers 90 days' notice before canceling plans. That means another round of cancellation letters will go out in March and again in May. Experts haven't been able to predict how many will pay more or less under the new, upgraded plans. An older policyholder with a pre-existing condition may find that premiums go down, and some will qualify for subsidies. In California, about 900,000 people are expected to lose existing plans, but about a third will be eligible for subsidies through the state exchange, Covered California, said Anne Gonzalez, their spokeswoman. Most canceled plans provided bare-bones coverage, she said. ‘They basically had plans that had gaping holes in the coverage. They would be surprised when they get to the emergency room or the doctor's office, some of them didn't have drug coverage or preventive care,’ Gonzalez said. The cancellations run counter to one of President Barack Obama's promises about his health care overhaul: 'If you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan' About 330,000 Floridians received cancellation notices from the state's largest insurer, Florida Blue. About 30,000 have plans that were grandfathered in. Florida insurance officials said they're not tracking the number of canceled policies related to the new law. National numbers are similar: 130,000 . cancellations in Kentucky, 140,000 in Minnesota and as many as 400,000 . in Georgia, according to officials in those states. Cigna . has sent thousands of cancellation letters to U.S. policyholders but . stressed that 99 percent have the option of renewing their 2013 policy . for one more year, company spokesman Joe Mondy said. Cancellation letters are being sent only to individuals and families who purchase their own insurance. However, . most policyholders in the individual market will receive some notice . that their coverage will change, said Dan Mendelson, president of the . market analysis firm Avalere Health. The . cancellations run counter to one of President Barack Obama's promises . about his health care overhaul: ‘If you like your health care plan, . you'll be able to keep your health care plan.’ Philip Johnson, 47, of Boise, Idaho, was . shocked when his cancellation notice arrived last month. The gift-shop . owner said he'd spent years arranging doctors covered by his insurer for . him, his wife and their two college-age students. After browsing the state exchange, he said he thinks he'll end up paying lower premiums but higher deductibles. He said the website didn't answer many of his questions, such as which doctors take which plans. ‘I was furious because I spent a lot of time and picked a plan that all my doctors accepted,’ Johnson said. ‘Now I don't know what doctors are going to take what. No one mentioned that for the last three years when they talked about how this was going to work.’","Millions of people with .

Five elderly people died after  suffering a devastating catalogue of neglect at a care home rated ‘good’ by the official regulator. Another 14 residents died of natural causes after suffering ‘sub-optimal’ care at the home, run by the Southern Cross chain. A coroner yesterday said the Orchid View home was riddled with ‘institutional abuse’ yet the Care Quality Commission had failed to raise the alarm. Victims: Residents Jean Halfpenny, left, and . Doris Fielding, right. Mrs Halfpenny died after being neglected at . Orchid View. She overdosed on the blood thinning drug warfarin . 'Disgraceful: A five-week inquest has heard how residents were given the wrong medication and left soiled . She said staff – several of whom are still working in the care sector – should be ‘ashamed’ of their behaviour, some of which involved shredding medical records in an attempted cover-up. A five-week inquest heard that residents were routinely given overdoses of medication, and were left soiled and in pain during two years of terrible mismanagement and staff shortages. West Sussex coroner Penelope Schofield said the regulator’s positive assessment of the £3,000-a-month home a year before it closed was ‘not fit for purpose’. She ruled that abuse and neglect by staff contributed to the deaths of Jean Halfpenny, 77, Wilfred Gardner, 85, Margaret Tucker, 77, Enid Trodden, 86, and John  Holmes, 85. Mrs Halfpenny died after being given three times the correct dose of the blood-thinning drug warfarin, and had to be admitted to hospital for bleeding. Victims: Enid Trodden, left, and Jean . Leatherbarrow, right, who were two of 19 elderly residents who died at . Orchid View care home in Copthorne where there was 'institutionalised . abuse' Abuse: Wilfred Gardner, 85, who died at the home after being neglected. A coroner was scathing as sher delivered a verdict following a five-week inquest . Lisa Martin, a former administrator who left in disgust and became a whistleblower, said she was asked to shred Mrs Halfpenny’s medical records to cover up the blunder, and new ones were falsified. The inquest came on the day that Health Secretary  Jeremy Hunt said the care of many elderly people in Britain is a ‘national disgrace’. A million older people are forgotten and isolated because no relatives and friends visit them. He promised new measures to beef up inspections of care homes after 112,000 cases of alleged abuse were referred by councils in England last year. Whistleblower: Lisa Martin, former carer at Orchid View, who raised the alarm after 28 separate drugs failings on one night shift . Mr Hunt said ‘something is going badly wrong’ in a society where potentially so many instances are happening every single week. It was revealed during the inquest that nurses shut doors on elderly people who called for help, an elderly woman was left in a toilet and forgotten, and parcel tape was used to secure a resident’s dressing. Miss Martin said the final straw was when she was told by a nurse that they had found 28 drug errors from just one night shift. She called police who arrived the next day. Orchid View was eventually closed down in late 2011 after another CQC probe found it had failed to meet eight of its essential standards of quality and safety. Sussex police began an investigation and five people were arrested, some on suspicion of manslaughter by gross negligence in relation to Mrs Halfpenny’s death. But there was judged to be insufficient evidence to prosecute. A serious case review will now take place into the deaths. It is the latest scandal to hit the NHS watchdog, which is already under fire for failing to spot the scandal at Morecambe Bay hospital where up to 14 babies died from neglect, and then allegedly trying to cover it up. The CQC was also accused of not doing more to stop the horrific abuse of disabled patients at Winterbourne View hospital in Bristol. Southern Cross was once Britain’s biggest care home operator, but collapsed with £1billion debts in 2011 after cost-cutting by a private equity firm, leaving 31,000 vulnerable residents stranded. The inquest heard the multi-million-pound home in Copthorne, near Crawley, had a ‘five star’ feel when it opened in September 2009, and its appearance ‘seduced’ families into believing it was well-run. But witnesses and former staff told how residents were treated with a lack of respect and dignity, and there were problems with medication and staffing levels. Miss Schofield said: ‘There was institutionalised abuse throughout the home and it started, in my view, at a very early stage, and nobody did anything about it. ‘This, to me, was from the top down. It was completely mismanaged and understaffed and failed to provide a safe environment for residents. ‘It’s a heart-breaking case. ‘We all have parents who will probably need care in the latter part of their lives.’ She said it was ‘disgraceful’ that the home was allowed to be run in the way it was and given a ‘good’ rating by the CQC in 2010 – a year before it shut. ‘I question how this could be the case and I question whether the inspection that did take place was fit for purpose,’ she said. Linzi Collings, the daughter of Jean Halfpenny, said: ‘How such terrible standards could go unnoticed by the authorities for so long has left us baffled.’ Anger: Solicitor Ian Christian speaks on behalf of the families of the victims of 'institutionalised abuse' at Orchid View care home . This week the Government announced a . package of proposals to prevent abuse and neglect in care homes, . including hidden  cameras and ‘mystery shoppers’ reporting back on their . experience. Ian Christian, of Irwin Mitchell solicitors, which represented seven of the families at the inquest, described the case as a ‘scandal’ which should not be allowed to happen again. Andrea Sutcliffe, the CQC’s chief inspector of adult social care, said the watchdog had to ‘learn lessons’ from the tragedy and a root-and-branch review had been launched. She said: ‘This was completely unacceptable, and I extend my sympathies to the relatives of everyone who received poor care there.’","19 elderly people died at the 'mismanaged and understaffed' home .

"By . Chris Greenwood . PUBLISHED: . 19:24 EST, 14 November 2013 . Criticism: Thersea May last month said Acpo 'was neither accountable to the public nor able to speak authoritatively on behalf of the whole of policing' A scandal-hit ‘boys club’ of chief constables is set to be abolished after it was severely criticised in a report last night. The Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) faces bring broken up after an independent review found millions of pounds could be better spent elsewhere. Retired Army General Sir Nick Parker said its ‘complex and unorthodox’ structure and status as a private company is unacceptable. He called for its most important responsibilities to be passed to individual forces and its controversial money-spinning offshoots to be cut loose. Sir Nick said the organisation is dominated by an ‘inner core’ of chiefs who preside over an often ‘informal’ body that lacks transparency and accountability. In its place, he said, should be a slimmed-down ‘chief constables’ council’ that better reflects the views of all the most senior police officers in the country. The fate of Acpo now lies in the hands of elected police and crime commissioners who commissioned the review. They wanted to know if the £4.2m taxpayer-funded organisation still has a place in the modern police landscape. Senior figures said they would announce their decision within weeks after consulting with the Government and others. Staffordshire’s police and crime commissioner Matthew Ellis, one of the leading figures behind the review, said its recommendations are ‘straight-forward and sensible’.Asked what would happen next, he said: ‘It cannot be rushed, we are dealing with sensitive and important areas of policing. ‘But there is no doubt at all that we have to improve the way things work, improve transparency and make sure we have an arrangement which fits the policing and wider environment.’ The Home Office has already withdrawn . its funding as responsibility for many areas of police governance were . handed to the fledgling College of Policing. In . a speech last month, Theresa May said Acpo ‘was neither accountable to . the public nor able to speak authoritatively on behalf of the whole of . policing.’ In recent years Acpo has been at the centre of a stream of scandals and controversy amid growing questions over its future. It . has been criticised for spending millions on luxury London flats for . its leaders and hiring former colleagues on salaries of up to £1,100 a . day as consultants. The furore led to accusations from some MPs that it is little more than a ‘boys club’ for serving and retired chief officers. Recommendations: Sara Thornton, Chief Constable of Thames Valley police and vice president of Acpo, said the report would be considered carefully . In September, the Daily Mail revealed its chief executive had been arrested on suspicion of theft after items disappeared from Acpo’s Westminster offices. In his review, Sir Nick said frustrations have been expressed over a lack of transparency on funding, as well as inadequate performance monitoring and auditing at Acpo. He said Acpo’s status as a private company is ‘out of place’ and it should give up its role overseeing the governance and £3m funding of four national police bodies. Instead the National Ballistics Intelligence Unit, National Wildlife Crime Unit, a central freedom of information team and the criminal records office should each be run by a single ‘lead’ force. Sir Nick said two private companies, involved in crime prevention and combating vehicle crime, as well as other profit-making activities, should be merged and run separately. He suggested questions remain over whether decisions made by Acpo are always in the best interests of the public or the ‘more particular requirements of a commercial organisation’. Sir Nick said that Acpo’s role for giving senior officers a ‘professional voice of the service’ remains, but should be replaced by a ‘chief constables’ council’. The retired Army general said the current system does not give ‘sufficient priority’ to finding a consensus among the large and diverse group of chiefs. He said: ‘There is a sense that for pragmatic reasons there is an inner core of more experienced chiefs who have greater influence, and this causes some to sit back and let other views prevail.’ Sir Nick said the police organisation is good value for money, but added that further savings could probably be made. He said: ‘My recommendations highlight that Acpo has carried out some critical and enduring functions, but there is scope for change particularly in the way that these are governed.’ Thames Valley Chief Constable Sara Thornton, the vice president of Acpo, said: ‘All chief officers will want to consider his report carefully and we will work with police and crime commissioners to take forward the recommendations.’ 'Boys club' for top police chiefs may be abolished after report finds £4.2m used to fund it could be better spent elsewhere.'","The Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) faces being broken up .

Saxon Axe, 20, used suntan lotion and a lit cigarette to set fire to his friend's right leg as a prank . A man has been jailed after setting fire to his friend’s leg using suntan lotion and a lit cigarette. Saxon Axe, 20, was on a beach in Weymouth, Dorset, with a group of friends when he picked up an aerosol can and sprayed it on his friend. He then held a lit cigarette to his friend's leg which was covered in the flammable liquid and immediately went up in flames. Axe tried to put out the fire by carrying the victim towards the sea and dousing the flames with water. However, the victim had to be taken to hospital where he was treated for serious burns and is now awaiting a skin graft operation to avoid permanent disfigurement. Axe pleaded guilty to a charge of grievous bodily harm and was given a ten-month prison sentence. Heather Shimmen, prosecuting at Dorchester Crown Court, said that the incident took place on June 19 on Weymouth seafront. She said: ‘The defendant held a lit cigarette to the victim’s leg and it engulfed his leg in flames. ‘The victim tried to extinguish the flames as did a friend, but to no avail.’ John Dyer, defending, said the offence was an act of foolishness. He said the victim was a friend of Axe’s for several years and that his client was ‘full of remorse’ for his behaviour. The incident took place on June 19 on Weymouth seafront in Dorset . Mr Dyer said: ‘There is no malice and no motive, it was just an absolute foolish prank that went wrong. ‘It was a completely thoughtless act which has resulted in very serious consequences.’ In jailing Axe, Judge Roger Jarvis said: ‘You were fooling around and then as part of that you sprayed this victim with suntan lotion and set fire to it. ‘It is patently obvious that was a foolish and dangerous thing to do and wickedly thoughtless so far as you are concerned with some very serious consequences for your victim.’","Saxon Axe, 20, was with his friend on seafront in Weymouth, Dorset .

Travellers staying in Barcelona come from across the world to see the Catalan city's stunning architecture, but many will never have seen a hotel as outlandish as this. Polish architects who dreamt up the Barcelona Rock - a 100m hostel made especially for climbers - say guests can get their night's sleep perched perilously on a rock ledge overlooking the Spanish city. It may be something of a health and safety nightmare and is certainly not what most would consider hotel comfort. But thankfully those intrepid enough to sleep under the stars 100m from the ground are harnessed to the rock ledge to prevent them rolling off in their sleep. The . unusual concept hostel created by UGO was made for the Barcelona 2011 . Bohemian Hostel for Backpackers international competition. Competition . rules asked designers to create a 100 metre tall tower hostel that . includes relaxation areas, stores, cafe and at the same time created a . new city landmark. Polish firm UGO now hope the Barcelona Rock will become a 'unique place' in the Spanish city. The proposed building will have fifty rooms, cinema, spa, cafe,pool, gym, bar, shops, and climbing walls for beginners. Naturally, the architects planned the hostel so that those using the swimming pool can jump from the rock into the water. The unique exterior would be made of rocks so advanced rock climbers can spend the night out using special equipment. The elevation is made of stone blocks, each four meters high, mounted on stilts of reinforced concrete. These blocks are fixed some distance from each other to ensure air penetrates the building.  The advantage of using stone in this climate is that it radiates heat at night and cools the air during the day. UGO boss Hugon Kowalski said: 'Barcelona Rock hostel is supposed to be a unique place. It is supposed to become a new symbol of Barcelona. Rooms with a view: Brave climbers who reach the summit of Barcelona Rock would be treated to glorious panoramic views across the Catalan city . 'In search for inspiration we were trying to find something common for the city's architectural marks such as Sagrada Familia, Torre Agbar or the nearby Museum of Modern Art. 'We found it in Montserrat - in a mountain range near Barcelona, the highest elevation in Catalonia, you can see it from Barcelona. 'The stone from that mountain range was used for the buildings of the old city.' He said the idea was to make the building look like part of a mountain. 'The stone elevation would also be planted with greenery and provide shelter to birds. All mod cons: As well as various hotel luxuries inside, the proposed rock wall harnesses customers to the ledge to prevent them falling off in their sleep . Stunning: The Polish firm behind Barcelona Rock describe the plans for the their building as a 'unique place' in Barcelona . It's hoped the structure would become a natural feature of historic importance in the centre of the metropolis. He added: 'There's a swimming pool, spa, gym, cinema, pub, shops and climbing walls for beginners.

An Arizona man was faced with a nightmare of a hospital bill after slipping and hitting his head in his bathroom. Scott Richardson had just stepped out of the shower on Valentine’s Day, and didn't wake up until almost two weeks later when he was faced with a $150,000 hospital bill. The 65-year-old lawyer from Scottsdale smacked his head on the bathroom floor and was taken to the Mayo Clinic Hospital close to his house. Nothing to drink to: Scott Richardson, 65, was faced with a bill for $150,000 after spending two weeks in a hospital that wasn't covered by his health insurance. His wife Holly, right, had been assured by hospital staff that all bills would be paid for . He was diagnosed with a bleeding ulcer that led to anemia, which caused him to pass out. 12 days after being admitted he was transferred to another hospital in the area before beginning a program of rehabilitation. Not giving up: Mr Richardson tried to negotiate with his insurer, Blue Cross, but was told he would have to settle his bill with the Mayo Clinic directly . The surprise bill came about because the Mayo Clinic was not in his insurer’s network. From the second he was in the ambulance to the emergency room and the intensive care unit, the clock was ticking and charges were racking up. ‘This is not anything anyone would . want to go through. It might have been easier if you did not have . insurance,’ Mr Richardson said in an interview with AZCentral last week. ‘I don’t remember Mayo. I was in the ICU for almost two weeks.’ His wife, Holly, was at his bedside throughout his recover and was told not to worry about the medical costs. Professionals . assured her that even though the hospital was out of network, they were . protected under a federal law called the Emergency Medical Treatment . and Labor Act (EMTALA). The . law was  passed in 1986 to prevent hospitals from refusing to treat . patients without insurance, but it doesn’t force insurers to cover . costs, including when patients are admitted to hospitals without their . consent or knowledge.Although Mr Richardson’s insurer, Blue . Cross Blue Shield of Arizona, paid for most of the bills and gave him . reimbursement checks for $30,000, he still faced a balance of $120,000 . that he was told to settle directly with the Mayo Clinic. The clinic offered to reduce the bill by 20 per cent and organise a payment plan for him. It would have left him paying around $94,000. ‘When an individual comes to Mayo Clinic in a medical emergency, Mayo provides all the necessary care to stabilize and treat patients, regardless of their insurance status,’ Mayo spokeswoman Lynn Closway said in a statement. ‘A patient’s health-benefit plan is determined by their insurance and may provide limited coverage for out-of-network care. Mayo works with all patients to provide guidance and options regarding their insurance coverage.’ Desert surprise: Mr Richardson was taken the the Mayo clinic because it was close to his house. He never considered that he would not be covered by his insurance company or the federal EMTALA law that covers emergency surgery . Mr Richardson said that paying off the bill in full would be financially devastating and it left a bitter taste after paying premiums for years. A lawyer by trade, despite not knowing about EMTALA before going into hospital he looked into the law enough to know that he should have been covered. Upon calling Blue Cross to attempt to reason with the insurance company he said that it like talking to a brick wall with associates unable to explain what he was covered for under the plan. Most of the representatives he spoke with also had no idea about the federal law or whether it even applied in his case. ‘Seventy-five percent of the people I talked to didn’t know what EMTALA was,’ he said. ‘The number of people I talked to who didn’t even know how to spell EMTALA was scary.’ Blue Cross officials defended their so-called ignorance by pointing out the complex nature of health plans and the law surrounding them. They maintain that it would be impossible for every customer service operator to know about every possible scenario. ‘We understand these are difficult issues,’ said Deanna Salazar, senior vice president and general counsel of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona to AZ Central. ‘We go above and beyond to make sure our customers get what they expect from their plans.’ Power of the press: It was only after local media got involved that the Mayo Clinic decided to drop the charges however the hospital maintain hat such media pressure had nothing to do with it . The newspaper and local Phoenix television station got in touch after one of Mr Richardson’s children who works for the local television station put the case on the news. Suddenly, the charges vanished and his $118,000 bill was erased. Blue Cross officials would not discuss the negotiation process nor reveal how the charges were resolved. They would also not share the information with Richardson, saying they do not discuss pricing, however they insist that it was nothing to do with the media’s involvement. ‘Just because patients get bills from a hospital doesn’t mean that’s what they should pay, Salazar said. ‘We can negotiate. We did it on his behalf ... We negotiated so he would have no residual amount owed to Mayo. We view this as a very positive result.’ Mr Richardson is overjoyed by the outcome but he is now worried was would happen to other people who would not have the same access to the media as him. ‘‘What really troubles me, as someone familiar with this field, is what does the average person do?’ he pondered.","After collapsing in his bathroom, Scott Richardson was stuck with an enormous bill his insurer wouldn't pay .

England fans travelling to the first match of next year's World Cup are going to face an army of dangerous creepy-crawlies when they arrive. Cobras, scorpions, and tarantulas are all found in the tropical city of Manaus, while the NHS has also warned against the risk of catching rabies from stray dogs. Roy Hodgson has also voiced concerns about how players will cope in the heat, which averages around 32C (90F) with humidity above 80 per cent. The Brazilian yellow scorpion is among the deadliest in the world and lives in the jungle around Manaus. It's sting can be fatal to humans (file picture) Fans will not want to wander too far off the beaten track in case they encounter deadly coral snakes . The Amazon rainforest around Manaus is home to the Brazilian yellow scorpion, one of the planet's  deadliest varieties, with a venomous sting that can be fatal in children or elderly adults. While tarantulas are scary, they are in fact less venomous than a bee and their bite only causes a small amount of pain . Fans will also want to stay on the beaten track, as the jungle is also home to a variety of coral snakes, which lurk in the tree canopy and on the forest floor and use their fangs to deliver a deadly, paralysing venom when threatened. Tarantulas also live in the loose soil, digging burrows where they wait for prey. While they cannot kill a human, their bites are painful and the hairs on their bodies can cause itching and sore skin. The tropical climate also attracts false water cobras which can grow up to 7ft long and deliver their venom with a grinding, chewing action, rather than a quick strike, which causes bruising and swelling. Aside from the stings and bites, which local hospitals say they can see five cases of every day, there is also a range of diseases to deal with. Mosquitoes in the jungle carry both yellow fever and dengue, viral infections which cause headaches, fever and muscle cramps. There are around 100million cases of . dengue every year and there is no vaccine for it, with symptoms taking . around two weeks to clear up. Supporters are being urged to vaccinate . themselves against yellow fever, which can be fatal as it attacks the . liver, causing jaundice and yellow skin - hence the name. The Arena Amazonia stadium, due to be completed in January, will host England for their opening game against Italy . The tropical heat, with temperatures reaching 32C (90F), brings mosquitoes which carry yellow fever and dengue which can cause fever, muscle cramps and headaches . Rabies is another serious risk from stray dogs found in the city's favelas, or slum districts. The infection is almost always fatal unless it is caught and treated very early on, before symptoms develop.

A milk rota in a Whitehall office was marked ‘restricted’ by mandarins obsessed with security and playing James Bond. An official also landed in hot water for leaving a document marked ‘restricted’ on a printer, even though it was the only thing written on the sheet of paper. Cabinet office minister Francis Maude said the farce had to end because Whitehall had failed to move with the times. Sensitive: A document on what days different milk was bought for civil servants to make tea and coffee was marked 'restricted' by over-zealous security officials . Now the Government's security classifications are to be dramatically streamlined in a bid to improve communication and save millions of pounds. In future all documents will be either top secret, secret or official - after ministers condemned the old six-tier system as a Cold War relic. Mr Maude ordered the shake-up after learning that a document detailing on what days full fat, semi-skimmed and skimmed milk was bought for civil servants to make tea and coffee was marked 'restricted' by over-zealous security officials . He also found emails could not be sent between the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence because their servers worked on different security levels. Instead, staff had to run between the buildings with printouts. The old markings of unclassified, protected, restricted and confidential are being merged into a new ‘official’ band.  Secret and top secret will remain in place. Spooks: Ministers said the view of spies like James Bond, pictured, passing top secret documents around Whitehall had not moved with the times . Mr Maude said: ‘Most people’s image of government security classifications is of M sliding Bond a buff-coloured folder stamped TOP SECRET. ‘But where Bond’s cutting-edge gadgets and cars have moved with the times, our security processes are beginning to show their age. ‘The existing system is confusing and often misapplied. ‘When I heard that a milk rota had been marked as “Restricted” I knew things had to change,’ he wrote in The Independent. ‘One of my team even got in trouble for leaving a document marked “Restricted” on the printer – even though it was otherwise entirely blank.’ Farce: Cabinet Office Francis Maude said he was dismayed at the way blank or innocuous documents were treated as secret . Most staff will now be issued with ‘off the shelf’ computers and mobile devices - such as those used by hospitals - rather than more specialist kit. A laptop with government encryption costs around £7,000 a year to run, whereas in future one to deal with ‘official’ documents could cost £1,000. A Cabinet Office source said the reforms were expected to save ‘many millions of pounds’. More than 700,000 civil servants and military personnel will begin using the new markings from April, with the rest of the public sector following  later. Mr Maude is understood to have handed back his top-security government computer and mobile equipment, and now uses devices with lower encryption. For documents that require a higher level of protection, he apparently only has paper copies. Mr Maude added: ‘Whitehall uses a security classification system designed decades ago. ‘We are changing that and introducing a new system fit for the digital age. It will speed up decisions, make it easier to share information and save hard-working taxpayers' money. ‘There has been a tendency to over mark documents rather than to manage risk properly. ‘This can devalue the basic security principles. ‘We think the most important and sensitive materials should be protected as 'Top Secret' or 'Secret' but for other information the new 'Official' category, with its renewed emphasis upon personal responsibility and accountability, will be appropriate for most of what government does.’","A blank sheet of paper left on a printer was treated as a security breach .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 07:46 EST, 30 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:46 EST, 30 October 2013 . A government scheme forcing the jobless to work in Poundland for free was legally flawed, the UK’s highest court ruled today. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith failed in a Supreme Court bid to overturn an earlier ruling that regulations underpinning the schemes were invalid. But he hailed the ruling which agreed it was ‘ridiculous to say that our schemes amounted to forced labour’. Ruling: The Supreme Court said jobseekers were not given enough information about the sanctions for not taking a placement at Poundland . University graduate Cait Reilly, 24, from Birmingham, challenged having to work for free at a local Poundland discount store. At the Court of Appeal today Lord Justice Pill, Lady Justice Black and Sir Stanley Burnton unanimously agreed that the 2011 ‘work for your benefits’ regulations failed to give the unemployed enough information, especially about the sanctions for refusing jobs under the schemes. It was also a victory for 40-year-old unemployed HGV driver Jamieson Wilson, from Nottingham, who objected to doing unpaid work cleaning furniture and as a result was stripped of his jobseeker’s allowance for six months. Criticism: Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said it was 'ridiculous' to suggest the scheme was forced labour . Lawyers for the pair said the immediate effect of the ruling was that all applicants who had their jobseeker’s allowance withdrawn for non-compliance with the schemes were entitled to reclaim their allowance. But the Supreme Court ruled that regulations did not constitute forced or compulsory labour. While the government took the case to the Supreme Court it fast-tracking retrospective legislation through Parliament. Today Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘We are very pleased that the Supreme Court today unanimously upheld our right to require those claiming jobseeker’s allowance to take part in programmes which will help get them into work. ‘We have always said that it was ridiculous to say that our schemes amounted to forced labour, and yet again we have won this argument. ‘Ultimately this judgment confirms that it is right that we expect people to take getting into work seriously if they want to claim benefits.’ Supreme Court President Lord Neuberger, Lord Mance, Lord Clarke, Lord Sumption and Lord Toulson ruled that the regulations were ‘invalid’ as they did not contain a sufficiently detailed ‘prescribed description’ of the work schemes. It also agreed that Mr Duncan Smith had failed to provide sufficient information about the schemes to Ms Reilly and Mr Wilson. But on the issue of ‘forced labour’ the justices dismissed an appeal by Ms Reilly and Mr Wilson, ruling that the regulations do not constitute forced or compulsory labour. Victory: Cait Reilly, pictured at an earlier hearing, took the government to court over its flagship back-to-work scheme . Ms Reilly said: ‘I am really pleased with today's judgment, which I hope will serve to improve the current system and assist jobseekers who have been unfairly stripped of their benefits. ‘I brought these proceedings because I knew that there was something wrong when I was stopped from doing voluntary work in a local museum and instead forced to work for Poundland for free. ‘I have been fortunate enough to find work in a supermarket but I know how difficult it can be. It must be time for the Government to rethink its strategy and actually do something constructive to help lift people out of unemployment and poverty.’ Phil Shiner, head of Public Interest Lawyers, said: ‘Once again the Department for Work and Pensions flagship Back to Work schemes have been found wanting. ‘Today's ruling from the Supreme Court is of huge constitutional and practical significance. My firm will now get on with challenging, by judicial review, the retrospective legislation which was shamefully rushed through Parliament by Iain Duncan Smith in March of this year.’","Supreme Court upheld earlier ruling that scheme was invalid .

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . PUBLISHED: . 19:44 EST, 17 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:34 EST, 18 October 2013 . British Gas bosses were subjected to a Twitter tirade yesterday as they battled to justify a punishing 9.2 per cent price rise that will add £123 a year to the average dual-fuel energy bill. Customer services director Bert Pijls was on the wrong end of an hour of non-stop abuse during a question and answer session that some described as a ‘car crash’. He went on the social networking site in an attempt to counter negative reaction to the price rise. Mr Pijls insisted the company had no choice but to put up bills in the face of the rising cost of wholesale energy and green taxes. But one Twitter user posted a picture of an old woman wrapped in blankets and huddled next to a heater, writing: ‘Do images like this help you sleep at night, Bertie?’ Lee Vincent wrote: ‘Hi Bert, which items of furniture do you, in your humble opinion, think people should burn first this winter? Felicity Morse asked: ‘Have you found a way to channel angry customer feedback into electricity?’ British Gas, which supplies 7.8million homes, announced a 10.4 per cent rise in electricity prices and 8.4 per cent for gas, to take effect on November 23. Its dual-fuel customers will see their average annual bill rise by £123 to £1,444 after the increases, according to figures from regulator Ofgem. But regional variations in prices mean some customers will see their bills top £1,500 a year. Twitter storm: British Gas customer services director Bert Pijls was subjected to a torrent of abuse on the social media website Twitter during an online Q&A . Enraged: While twitter uses were angry about what they saw as rip off charges they were also able to see the funny side of the social media gaffe . Britain’s biggest energy supplier said . at least £50 of the price rise can be blamed on green taxes and other . measures imposed by the Government. But . this was denied by ministers, and David Cameron hit back by urging . customers to switch away from the company over the ‘very disappointing’ increase. Critics condemned . the increase as a ‘disgrace’ and said it was a betrayal of pensioners . and families who face a nightmare choice between heating and eating this . winter. The price rise . follows an 8.2 per cent increase by SSE last week, while the other big . energy suppliers are expected to follow suit. British . Gas saw profits rise by 11 per cent last year to £606million. More . significantly, profits at its parent company, Centrica, which makes . money from North Sea gas and power generation, surged 14 per cent to . £2.7billion. Ian Peters, managing director of residential supplies for the company, insisted he had no choice but to raise prices. ‘What’s . pushing up energy prices at the moment are costs that are not all . directly under our control, such as the global price of energy, charges . that we have to pay for using the national grid that delivers energy to . the home, and the cost of the Government’s social and environmental . programmes,’ he said. British . Gas put much of the blame for the price rise on green subsidies for . wind farms and new nuclear power stations and the ECO – Energy Company . Obligation – scheme. This involves raising money through bills to . provide free insulation to the homes of the poor. It wants the cost shifted to general taxation, saying this ‘would lower the average annual dual fuel bill significantly’. But Energy Secretary Ed Davey said British Gas should carry the can for higher bills, not the Government. He . suggested the company’s figures about the cost of running the ECO . scheme were bogus saying, they ‘just don’t add up’. Last night Energy . Minister Greg Barker admitted the energy price rises were tantamount to . ‘robbery’. Asked on Channel 4 News if customers were being robbed he said: ‘Absolutely, which is why we are doing something about it. ‘We’ve . made it easier to switch, we’ve made bills easier to read and . encouraged people to penalise the big six by voting with their feet and . going to another supplier. Online gaffe: Twitter users responded by bombarding British Gas customer services director Bert Pijls with lots of questions relating to directors pays and bonuses . ‘By . freezing the bills you kill the independents [firms] who bring choice . and competition to the market.’ Caroline Flint, Labour’s energy . spokesman, said: ‘Even the government minister can see this price rise . today is unfair to customers, but would not refer the rise to the . Competition Commission. We don’t have to, we’ve promised to freeze the . bills.’ High energy bills . have risen to the top of the political agenda following a promise by the . Labour leader Ed Miliband to freeze prices if the party wins power at . the 2015 general election. The Prime Minister said: ‘I think it is a very disappointing announcement by British Gas. ‘There is something everyone can do, which is look to switch their electricity or gas bill from one supplier to another. ‘On . average, this can help people save sometimes as much as £200 on their . bill. So I would encourage customers who are not happy to go to the . switching sites online and see whether they can get a better deal.’ A Downing Street spokesman suggested the Government would investigate ways to make it easier to switch, . John . Allan, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: . ‘Today’s British Gas increase at three times the rate of inflation is a . disgrace. Ill advised: Some twitter users pointed out it might have been a bad idea to hold an online Q&A the same day the company hiked prices . ‘It is going to . hit many households hard at a time when they simply cannot afford it. More than 40 per cent of small businesses are with British Gas and . energy price rises are going to make the cost of doing business even . higher.’ Gillian Guy, chief . executive at Citizens Advice, called on other suppliers to hold prices. ‘Now is the time for energy firms to show an understanding of the . day-to-day lives of their customers and put a freeze on further price . rises this winter,’ she said. Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer group Which?, said more action is needed. ‘We want the Government to intervene to make sure everything possible is done to keep prices in check,’ he said. Consumers . can protect themselves against price rises by switching to fixed rate . deals, some of which guarantee not to raise tariffs until 2017. For . example, First Utility has a tariff fixed until January 2016 with an . average annual bill of £1,274.06, while EDF Energy has a fixed deal . charging an average of £1,339.70 until March 2017.","Price rise that will add £123 a year to the average dual-fuel energy bill .

New DNA tests on a knife allegedly used to murder British student Meredith Kercher show traces of Amanda Knox but crucially none of the victim, a leaked copy of the report has revealed. The court-ordered findings will be revealed in full next week, when the retrial resumes against 26-year-old Knox and her ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 29. It is already being seen by both defense teams as a boost to their cases. As has been typical of the high-profile case, details have been leaked and they reveal that traces of Knox's DNA are on the 30cm kitchen knife, believed to be the murder weapon, but significantly there is no trace of Miss Kercher. The DNA of Amanda Knox (left) has been found on a knife allegedly used to murder Meredith Kercher six years ago but none of the victim's DNA. A retrial against Knox and ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito (right) resumes next week . British student Meredith Kercher was brutally murdered six years ago on Friday while she was studying in Perugia, Italy. Questions still remain over her death . At the original hearing against Knox and Sollecito, the court was told how Knox's DNA was found on the handle and Miss Kercher's DNA on the blade. However a subsequent hearing ruled DNA traces of the victim were so small they were inconclusive. The knife had originally been seized from Sollecito's home in Perugia, Italy, where 20-year-old Miss Kercher was found brutally murdered six years ago this Friday. Knox and Sollecito were originally found guilty of the murder at an initial trial in 2009 but dramatically cleared two years later. Earlier this year, Italy's Supreme Court ordered a fresh trial which began last month. Forensic experts from the paramilitary Carabinieri carried out new tests at their headquarters in Rome and deposited their 'secret' report at the court in Florence. The report says that DNA traces from Knox have been found on the knife in the area where the 'blade joins the handle' but no trace of Miss Kercher or Sollecito. Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito pictured outside the rented house in Perugia, Italy on November 2, 2007, the day after British student Meredith Kercher was murdered . Knox's lawyer, Luciano Ghirga,  said: 'These results once again underline the distance between my client and the murder of Meredith Kercher. This shows that the court was right to dismiss this evidence when the pair were cleared of murder in 2011. 'It once again underlines that this knife is not the murder weapon and the investigators have worked well in difficult circumstances as the amount of DNA on the knife is very, very small.' Sollecito's lawyer, Luca Maori, said: 'This proves that all Amanda Knox did with that knife is pull it from a drawer in my client's kitchen and simply use it for cooking. There is no trace of Meredith on that knife as we clearly proved at the second hearing.' Francesco Maresca, who represents the Kercher family from Coulsdon, Surrey, said: 'This shows that Knox used the knife and put together with the other elements, enables us to pursue the responsibility of those accused.' He added: 'The earlier hearings were told how DNA from Meredith was found on the tip and we will be arguing this point when the trial resumes.' Italian police surround the rented home in Perugia, Italy where Miss Kercher was discovered in November 2007 with her throat cut . Meanwhile prison guard Raffaele Argiro, who Knox accused of sexually harassing her, has been ordered to stand trial for abusing another female inmate at Perugia's Capanne Prison where she was held. Knox said that Argiro would call her to his office and question her about sexual experiences and that he would always attend her prison medical examinations. His trial for abusing an unidentified Milanese traffic warden who was briefly held in the jail is due to start later this month and he denies any wrongdoing in both cases.","Knife originally seized from home in Perugia, Italy, where Meredith, 20, was found .

Staff at a school for  problem pupils have been giving out cigarettes to children as young as 11 and allowing them to smoke in the playground. The cigarettes are taken off the youngsters at the start of the day but given back to them during their morning break and at lunchtime. The controversial policy, approved by a headteacher, was put in place to stop pupils from leaving the site to have a cigarette – as staff are obliged to do. Staff at the Elmete Central School in Roundhay, Leeds, have given children between 11 and 16 permission to smoke their cigarettes during break and lunchtimes on school grounds . But the education authority has . launched an investigation and a newly-appointed head at the Elmete . Central School in Leeds has agreed to end the practice and ban all . smoking on the premises. The school for 75 pupils aged 11 to 16, who have behavioural and . emotional problems, is attended by some of the city’s ‘most challenging . young people’. They had been allowed to smoke between 11.10 and 11.20am and from 12.20 to 1.10pm until the policy was changed on Wednesday. 'Pupils handed in their cigarettes and possessions each morning and were handed back their cigarettes, at the allocated times each day. 'Considering the youngest are only 11, it does not seem right. Staff have to go some way off the school grounds if they wish to smoke.' It is understood the policy was put in place by the previous head teacher as a compromise as some of the children were not attending school and were occasionally leaving the premises when they did attend. It is thought pupils were allowed to smoke in a controlled environment and to keep them on site. The current head teacher has only been in charge for a few days and has agreed to ensure the policy does not continue. Anti-smoking health campaigners have labeled the decision 'inappropriate, wrong and unethical'. And Leeds City Council education chiefs have launched an investigation at the school for 75 pupils with behavioural and emotional difficulties. Deborah Arnott, chief executive of UK anti-smoking health charity ASH, said: 'Allowing children to smoke at school is wrong in so many ways. 'It is illegal to sell tobacco to young people under the age of 18 precisely because tobacco is so hazardous to health and wellbeing. 'It is totally inappropriate and unethical to allow children to smoke in a school environment. 'The . school wouldn’t allow children to drink so why are they allowing them . to smoke? We urge the school to urgently review this policy.' It is believed cigarettes were confiscated at the beginning of the day but then handed back to pupils by staff later in the day . Scott Crosby, regional tobacco control policy manager for Yorkshire and the Humber, added: 'By the age of 15, around one in eight school children have become regular smokers. just one cigarette can make children more likely to start smoking several years later. 'Children who smoke often become regular adult smokers of which half will die as a result of their habit. 'Children will also suffer immediate health consequences from smoking, coughs, increased phlegm, wheeziness and shortness of breath, and take more time off school’. Anti-smoking health campaigners have labelled the decision 'inappropriate, wrong and unethical' Paul Brennan, deputy director for children’s services, at Leeds City Council said: 'We take this issue very seriously and as soon as it was brought to our attention we spoke to the school and issued an instruction that it must stop immediately. 'We are confident that this practice has now ceased. 'The recently appointed headteacher has agreed to review any such practices and to make sure this does not happen in the future we will conduct unannounced visits by local authority staff. 'We have a strict no smoking policy in all of our schools and encourage them to promote healthy lifestyles to all pupils.' The school regularly invites health professionals into school to talk about the dangers of smoking and offers help and advice to stop. The schools website states: 'All staff, including support staff work to remove barriers to learning, and support the pastoral needs of learners.' It also states they work to provide positive role models. A recent Ofsted report noted that the confidence young people have in staff was high.","The Elmete Central School in Roundhay, Leeds, is being investigated .

British Gas, which is about to hit families with big price rises, has been shamed with a record fine of £2.5million for failing customers. The country’s biggest energy firm, with 13million customers, mishandled complaints and left people in the dark about how to get help. The fine, the largest ever imposed by industry regulator Ofgem, is hugely embarrassing for a company which has launched several initiatives to overcome a well-earned reputation for poor customer service. Fined: British Gas's £2.5 million bill is the largest fine ever imposed for customer-service failings . Ofgem said British Gas had failed to re-open cases when customers indicated their complaint had not been resolved. The firm also failed to provide key information about how people could pursue complaints with the independent Energy Ombudsman.

Workers in the private sector have seen no increase in pay in the last year, new figures show. A headline 0.4 per cent rise in total has been entirely fuelled by . increases for public sector staff, the Office for National Statistics said. Even these modest rises in pay have been hugely outstripped by increases in the cost of living, leaving millions worse off in real terms. Pay gap: In January to March this year wages in the public sector were 1.4 per cent higher than the same time in 2013, but private sector wages were flat . Overall wages for all workers increased by just 0.4 per cent in the first three months of 2013, including a fall in March. But this was accounted for entirely by a 1.4 per cent rise in pay for taxpayer-funded jobs. It comes despite the coalition imposing a public sector pay freeze and then capping rises at one per cent for most staff. New . figures showed the number of people out of work rose by 15,000 to 2.52 . million.

The rate of unemployment rose to 7.8 per cent. Total . pay including bonuses from January to March was up just 0.4 per cent on . the same period in 2012, the Office for National Statistics. The . rise was entirely fuelled by increase state-funded jobs, with employees . in the private sector seeing no year-on-year increase in pay at all. The gap between wage rises and increases in the cost of living has widened markedly since last summer, with pay going up by just 0.4 per cent compared to a 2.8 per cent increase in inflation . The figure for March alone showed a fall in pay of 0.4 per cent, the first negative since March 2009.The Consumer Prices Index, which tracks the annual rise in the cost of living, stands at 2.8 per cent. It means wage rises are failing to cover rises in bills for food, housing and shopping leaving people worse off every month. Labour MP Catherine McKinnell said in the Commons yesterday: 'Average earnings are rising at the lowest rate since the end of 2009.' She pointed to a study by the Resolution Foundation, that warned the squeeze on average incomes is set to continue for many years. 'The foundation estimates that... the gap between what people earn and what they would have been earning had their wages risen in line with inflation will have risen to £3,200 by 2017.' Average earnings excluding bonuses rose by 0.8 per cent, the lowest rise since records began in 2001. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ‘Those in work are taking a hammering in their pay packets with wage growth down to just 0.4 per cent, while prices rise far more quickly.‘It's no wonder the economy is struggling when people in work are getting poorer every month.’ After rising for previous quarters, the fissures showed a surprise fall in the overall rate of unemployment to 0.8 per cent . The figures also revealed that the number of people in work fell by 43,000 in the latest quarter to March, to 29.7 million, the biggest fall since autumn 2011. Some 902,000 people had been out of work for more than a year, a 23,000 increase on the three months to December. The number of unemployed 16 to 24-year-olds fell by 17,000 to 958,000. The government claimed there were now more than half a million job vacancies in the UK, the highest number since 2008. The number of people claiming out-of-work benefit Jobseekers Allowance in April fell to its lowest level since May 2011, but still stands at 1.52million. The drop in employment by 43,000 was blamed on a fall in part-time workers and government training schemes. The number of people in full-time jobs rose by 10,000 on the quarter. Employment minister Mark Hoban said: 'There are record numbers of women in work, fewer young people unemployed and more vacancies available for those looking for work. Labour's Liam Byrne accused Tories of bickering over Europe while families were struggling . 'We are also seeing continuing falls in the number of people claiming Jobseeker’s Allowance which is positive. Whilst there has been a disappointing increase in the headline rate of unemployment, we shouldn't forget the progress we are making. 'We are not complacent. To win the global race we need to do all that we can to help people achieve their aspiration to look after themselves and their families.' The number of people classed as economically inactive, including students, people on long-term sick leave and those who have given up looking for work, rose by 47,000 to nine million. Despite yesterday's increase in unemployment, the total is 92,000 lower than a year ago. The unemployment rate from January to March was 7.8 per cent, down from 7.9 per cent in December to February. Liam Byrne, Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary, said: ‘We now have definitive proof the Government has simply failed to get Britain back to work.’ He said the Government had done nothing in the Queen's Speech to help solve the ‘jobs crisis’ and instead Tory MPs were bickering over Europe. ‘Families struggling for work will be asking quite simply, what planet are these people on?’ However, Neil Carberry, director of employment and skills for the CBI, said: ‘Given the challenging economic conditions at the end of last year, it's unsurprising that we're now seeing fewer people in work. ‘What's encouraging, however, is that economic conditions seem to be improving and that full-time jobs are still being created.’ Martin Beck, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ‘Following recent positive news on the economy, the UK labour market data provides something of a reality check. ‘There was a triple whammy of bad news, with employment in the three months to March down by 43,000 and unemployment up by 15,000. Meanwhile, the squeeze on real earnings has intensified.’","Total pay from January to March was just 0.4% up year-on-year .

Scientists have created a new type of material that can be used to create curved smartphone screens that allows pictures and words to be displayed round corners. The lightweight and durable C-Axis Aligned Crystal (CAAC) material means there is no longer any need for wasted space on phone screens. The prototypes, created by a Japanese company, even allow rolling information to run down the sides of a smartphone. The lightweight and durable C-Axis Aligned Crystal (CAAC) material was used to create this prototype smartphone, which has icons down its sides and allows images to 'spill' round its corners. It also allows for rolling text down its sides (pictured right) Semiconductor Energy Laboratory (SEL) showed off its new technology at the FPD 2013 electronics trade show in Japan. Many people have predicted that phones of the future will have curved screens and the crystal-based material means that it is possible to make side-roll and top-roll OLED displays that allow pictures and words to 'spill over' the phone's edges. The CAAC material is less than 100 microns thick and is currently the 'only technology that can display a picture on bent edges,' according to SEL.

In Taiwan, the symbol of luck is a little less glamorous. The Taipei City’s Department of Civil Affairs is calling on pregnant women to donate unused maxi pads or tampons to give out as a good luck charm to people hoping to get pregnant. According to the Taipei Times, . Taiwanese tradition says that pregnant women can share their fertility . luck with others by passing on their unused sanitary goods. Speaking about the bizarre tradition, department commissioner Huang Lu Ching-ju said: 'We hope that Taipei residents who want to get pregnant will be blessed by the lucky pads and that their wishes will come true.' And it seems that some city residents have had some experience with the good luck charm. Civil servant at the Shilin District Office, Hsu Chia-ying - . who is expecting her second child next month - told the paper that many . of her friends had asked for her unused pads or tampons to try and share . her fertility luck.

An honest builder who handed in nearly £18,000 in cash to police after he found it stashed in a fire-damaged flat will go without any reward following a High Court judge's ruling. Steven Fletcher found the hoard of 'neatly bundled' notes in a metal box in a burnt-out property he was renovating in King Street, Leicester, in September 2011. The £17,940 cash haul - all in £20 notes and neatly packaged into £1,000 bundles - was concealed under a kitchen unit. The flat had been empty since a fire gutted it six months earlier and Mr Fletcher immediately handed in his find to police. But a High Court judge has ruled Mr Fletcher does not have any right to the cash after police failed to trace its origins. Honest: Builder Steven Fletcher found nearly £18,000 in £20 notes hidden in a burnt-out property he was renovating in Leicester and handed it in to police . 'Mr Fletcher is an honest man,' noted Mr Justice Lewis, who added: 'He took the find, as any honest person would, to the police.' Police experts and forensic analysts examined the mysterious hoard. Drug-testing was, however, 'inconclusive', although some notes showed minute traces of cocaine. Magistrates nevertheless ordered forfeiture of the cash under the Proceeds of Crime Act after Leicestershire's Chief Constable, Simon Cole, successfully argued that it probably came from 'unlawful criminal conduct'. That decision was later confirmed at Leicester Crown Court. Ruling: Steven Fletcher challenged the forfeiture of the cash under the Proceeds of Crime Act after the origin of the money was never discovered but a High Court judge ruled the money should be confiscated . Mr Fletcher, who was left without a penny from his find even though no-one else had laid claim to the cash, challenged the money's forfeiture at the High Court, insisting there was no evidence to link it to the criminal underworld. However, Mr Justice Lewis said the careful sorting of the notes into bundles of one denomination meant they were 'unlikely to be the profits of legitimate cash trading'. The fact that the cash had been hidden and never reclaimed was also suspicious. The judge left Mr Fletcher with only a tribute to his honesty as he backed the money's forfeiture to the public purse. 'In my judgment the crown court was entitled to infer that the money was obtained by unlawful conduct of an unidentifiable kind,' he concluded.","Steven Fletcher found the hoard of .

Julius Ziga, 34, his then partner Magdalena Ferkova, 33, her sister Iveta, 32, their aunt Alena Lackova, 39, and her husband Jan Lacko, 39, ran a two-year scam swindling the tax credits system. They brought friends and family from Slovakia and the Czech Republic to Nottingham to make benefit claims, then continued to collect the cash after the claimants returned home. Ringleaders: Julius Ziga, left, 34, and Magdalena Ferkova, right, 33, brought Czechs and Slovaks to claim child tax credits in Britain then continued collecting the cash after the foreigners returned to Eastern Europe . Also jailed: Iveta Ferkova, 32, left, and Jan Lacko, 39, right, were part of the gang which managed around 50 fraudulent child tax credit claims to pocket up to £33,000 a week, much of which was gambled away . Between January 2008 and April 14, 2010, the four pocketed up to £33,000 a week, using the cash to gamble in casinos as well as splash out on luxury cars, including a Mercedes and BMW 5 series. Nottingham Crown Court heard the gang managed around 50 false claims to steal £750,000 in tax credits from HMRC - and would have gone on to steal a further £500,000 had they not been caught. Ziga, Lacko and Iveta Ferkova were all jailed at Nottingham Crown Court today for conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation. Lackova was handed a suspended sentence on the same charge. Magdalena Ferkova was not sentenced today with the court told she has fled the country in an effort to escape punishment. An international arrest warrant has been issued.

'They . were then transported back while you managed their claims and bank . accounts in their names. You kept most of the money for yourselves, . sending some, a very limited amount, back to those claimants.' The judge added: 'This was fraudulent from the outset. It was well organised and the sums obtained were considerable.' The gang, including Elena Lackova and Jan Lacko, left, managed around 50 false claims to steal £750,000 in tax credits from HMRC, using the cash to buy cars like the 5 Series BMW pictured left with Magdalena Ferkova . Prosecutor Luke Blackburn told the . court the fraud was uncovered 'by chance' when a boarder agency staff . stopped Ziga at random before he got on a Channel Tunnel train to . Europe. He added: 'When his . phone was analysed they found texts welcoming him to France and Germany . and in a Lidl bag found at an address was documents relating to flights . and trips to Europe.

'The Crown can never know exactly how much money was gambled away in cash. 'But we can say that both Magdalena Ferkova and Iveta Ferkova had active gambling habits. 'Some of the money was used with casino accounts, but we can never know how much was gambled in cash at the casinos. 'When .

Ziga was jailed for four years while Iveta Ferkova was handed a five-year sentence. Lacko was jailed for three years while his wife Lackova was given a two-year prison sentence, suspended for two years. The judge ordered that those going to prison will be deported when they are released after serving half of their sentence. As the foursome were jailed family members who had packed the public gallery stormed out of the court room. Gary Lampon, assistant director of criminal investigation for HMRC, said after the case : 'This gang was extremely well organised and ruthless in their ambition to steal vast amounts of public money at the expense of the British taxpayer. 'They exploited the many individuals they lured to the UK from abroad with the promise of legal employment, but then manipulated and discarded them.' Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: 'It’s deeply worrying that our soft-touch welfare system was so easily exploited by criminals.' A proceeds of crime hearing to determine what assets should be seized from the gang will be held at a later date.","Czech migrants ran two-year scam to swindle child tax credits system .

A Tory councillor named on an arrest warrant over a suspected revenge killing in Pakistan met David Cameron at a 10 Downing Street festival. Abdul Aziz met the Prime Minister at an Eid celebration last month. He is named on an arrest warrant in connection with the brutal killing of his cousin, who was gunned down with a .44 calibre rifle and handgun in Gujrat last year. Mr Aziz, a councillor in Pendle, Lancashire, was invited to the party by East Lancashire MP, Andrew Stephenson. In attendance: Abdul Aziz, pictured centre, poses with PM David Cameron at 10 Downing Street . He defected from Labour earlier this year and was welcomed by the Conservatives - despite the party knowing of the allegations against him. Mr Aziz has always denied involvement in the murder and has said he was in Britain at the time. Wanted: Pakistani police wish to speak with the Lancashire councillor, pictured, in connection with the murder of Muhammad Ilyas . The UK has no extradition treaty with Pakistan so he would have to travel there willingly to be under risk of arrest. Mr Aziz told his local paper after the Eid party on October 21: 'I was proud to see the Prime Minister and enjoyed myself, really. I shook hands with him and he welcomed me. ‘We had a great chat with Andrew Stephenson, too, and we thank him that he recommended us to be invited by the Prime Minister. It was great.’ He is listed on a document that names four men Pakistani police wish to speak to in relation to the murder of Muhammad Ilyas in the village of Domian on May last year, just days after he was elected to the council. Mr Ilyas was shot in the stomach and arm after four armed men burst into his house. Mr Aziz said last month when the allegations surfaced: ‘I don’t know who has accused me or why I am named. It’s the first time I have seen the document. ‘This is an incident that has devastated my family. It can only be to stop me going back to Pakistan to see my family and to help out. People don’t realise that this is my family. It is my cousin who has died. ‘In all my life I have never been in argument or aggressive. This has nothing to do with me.’ Meeting: The PM met Mr Aziz, whose name is listed on a document published by website Political Scrapbook, during an Eid celebration . The arrest warrant - published by the Political Scrapbook website and translated from Urdu - describes the incident was a ‘revenge’ killing ‘done on the hook of Abdul Aziz’. It lists 19 supposed witnesses but does not name Mr Aziz as one of the gunmen in the description of the incident. It is alleged four men, armed with a 30 bore pistol and a 44 bore rifle, entered a house at around 5pm on May 1, 2012, and shot Mr Ilyas in the stomach and arm. Labour MP Graham Jones has written to the Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps, querying why the Prime Minister met Mr Aziz while police want to speak to him. Correspondence: Labour MP Graham Jones has written to Conservative Party Chairman Grant Shapps, pictured, about the meeting . Mr Jones said there were ‘serious allegations’ which involved an arrest warrant for Mr Aziz. He asked whether ‘security arrangements at 10 Downing Street are adequate’ when assessing visitors. Mr Jones, the MP for Haslingden and Hyburn, wrote: ‘Was Number 10 aware that Mr Aziz was wanted in connection with this incident? 'Do you think Councillor Aziz should still be a member of the Conservative Party whilst such questions remain? 'Do you think it is acceptable to the victim’s family that one of the people named on the arrest warrant should be invited to Downing Street and shake hands with the Prime Minister?’ He also queried whether the Conservative party had conducted its own investigation into the allegations. A spokesman for Mr Shapps declined to comment, simply pointing to earlier statements made to the press by Mr Aziz. A spokesman for the Prime Minister said: ‘We don’t comment on security issues. His explanation for the allegations is there.’ Mr Aziz did not respond to the Mail’s request for a comment.","Tory councillor Abdul Aziz met the PM at an Eid celebration last month .

The world number one golfer had to negotiate strong crosswinds and moving traffic . in the opposite lane, but he maintained his composure to hit several solid shots across the two continents. However many Istanbul locals were far from impressed as the publicity stunt, ahead of Woods' £1.5million ($2.4million) appearance at the Turkish Airlines World Golf Final at Antalya this week, caused traffic chaos. Scroll down for video . Fore: U.S. golfer Tiger Woods prepares to slam a golf ball from Europe into Asia along the Bosphorus Bridge in Istanbul . Authorities were forced to halt traffic on one side of the bridge at one of the busiest times of day, causing horrific tailbacks and delays. The Bosphorus Bridge, which stretches for one-and-a half kilometres, is one of two suspension bridges currently spanning the Bosphorus Strait in Istanbul. It was opened in 1973 and currently around 180,000 vehicles pass over it in both directions every day.

Last month Turkey opened a tunnel under the Bosphorus - the deepest submerged railway tunnel of its type in the world. The opening of the major engineering project marked the completion of a plan initially proposed by an Ottoman sultan about 150 years ago. The tunnel is just one of Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan's large-scale plans. Others include a separate tunnel being built under the Bosphorus for cars, a third bridge over the strait, the world's biggest airport and a massive canal that would bypass the Bosphorus. Woods is one of eight top players, including Lee Westwood, Rory McIlroy and Justin Rose, to be asked to perform at the the event. The golfer is ranked number one in the world despite not having won a major tournament since the U.S. Open in 2008. He has bounced back from an embarrassing sex scandal and divorce in 2009, to this year regain his position as the world's highest paid sports star earning an estimated £49million ($79 million). He will reportedly earn around £5million ($8million) for the last month alone after appearing at the Abu Dhabi Championship and in a one-off exhibition match with Rory McIlroy in China. And despite being dropped earlier this year as the face of the franchise, Woods continues to receive payouts from the PGA tour video games. He is also sponsered by Rolex, Upper Deck, TLC Eye Centers, NetJets, Japan’s Kowa and sports nutrition firm Fuse Science. However sports equipment manufacturer Nike remains his most lucrative sponsor paying him an estimated £12.5million a year.","Golfer's publicity stunt ahead of £1.5m appearance at Turkish tournament .

A maths teacher has been arrested for allegedly trafficking methamphetamine in what could be a real-life version of the hit TV series Breaking Bad. Stephen Doran, 57, has been charged by police after he was found with a package believed to contain almost half a kilo of the drug which had been sent to his school in suburban Boston via the US Postal Service. When he appeared in court, bald-headed Doran's lawyer said he has undergone months of chemotherapy for stage three cancer. 'His life was on the line - literally,' he said. In court: Police said they caught math teacher Stephen Doran, 57, with almost half a kilo of methamphetamine . Accused: Doran is accused of having a large package of the drug sent to the school via the US Postal Service . Evidence: Police say they found more drugs, $10,000 in cash, digital scales and 'other items consistent with drug distribution' at Doran's home . The case bears a remarkable resemblance the plotline of award-winning TV series Breaking Bad, in which high school chemistry teacher Walter White begins producing and dealing meth after being diagnosed with cancer. In the show, Mr White - played by actor Bryan Cranston - uses the money to pay for medical bills and support his family believing he has only months to live. Police said Stephen Doran left Match Charter Middle School at around 12.30pm on Tuesday after receiving a large package. When he was pulled over by state troopers they recovered two heat-sealed bags of a crystalline substance which analysts say is consistent with methamphetamine. Police said they were acting on a tip-off and that the drugs had a street value of around $50,000. A search of Doran's home revealed $10,000 in cash, a digital scale and 38 additional grams of a similar substance. The Emmy award-winning TV series starring Bryan Cranston, revolves around the life of Walter White. The middle-aged chemistry teacher had the chance to be a brilliant academic but chose instead to work in a high school. At home he has wife who nags him constantly and a brother-in-law who works for the Drug Enforcement Agency and never ceases to let Walter know he is the alpha male of the family. Then he is diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer and everything changes. Walter encounters an old pupil of his, Jesse Pinkman, who happens to be a local methamphetamine dealer. Using his chemistry expertise, the pair set up as a producers and dealers of crystal meth. Walter's purpose appears to be solely to earn money to pay for his escalating medical bills and create a nest egg for his family after his death. But the change of career and the fear of his mortality also triggers much-deeper changes in this once placid character. The fifth and final season of Breaking Bad will run in the US from August 11. WATCH THE TRAILER FOR SEASON FIVE OF BREAKING BAD HERE: . The teacher has been charged with drug trafficking and also violating the state's drug laws in a school zone. Doran was ordered to remain on home confinement with a GPS device attached to him. He is allowed to leave his house for medical appointments if he posts $10,000 bail. If convicted he faces between eight and twenty years in prison. A spokesman from Doran's school, Mike .

"PUBLISHED: . 15:18 EST, 21 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 15:25 EST, 21 December 2012 . Former lap dancer Nadine Quashie, 29, lost her latest court battle today to sue Stringfellows night club for unfair dismissal . A former Stringfellows lapdancer lost her landmark legal battle to become the first stripper to sue for unfair dismissal today. Nadine Quashie, 29, was self-employed and so could not sue London's Covent Garden nightclub, the Court of Appeal ruled. And Miss Quashie, of Greenford, west London, was compared to a church organist in her fight to be a recognised employee. Employment law specialist David von . Hagen, a partner at law firm Winckworth Sherwood, said: 'Strippers and church organists do . not generally have a great deal in common, but this case brings the two . together because exactly the same legal principles are at stake. 'There have been a number of recent cases where church organists have brought similar actions, claiming unfair dismissal when removed from their post and basing their arguments about being employees, like Nadine Quashie, on the level of control exercised over their work. 'As in Nadine Quashie’s case, the Courts would look at the degree of control the club owners or the church ministers exercise, directing when and what music to play or where and when to dance.' Miss Quashie is now set to continue her case in the highest court of the land . - appealing to the Supreme Court. Today's decision overturned a previous ruling by the Employment Appeal Tribunal that Miss Quashie was employed by Stringfellows because the club imposed contractual obligations on her. Miss Quashie had alleged that she had to work set days and attend meetings at the club - or face being fined. The single mother told the court she had to comply with the club's strict image and dress code that saw her dance topless wearing only a G-string on stage and naked in private. While working she had to be on standby ready to perform free pole dances whenever summoned by the DJ. Miss Quashie also claimed she had to perform free dances for customers 'on the hour every hour' whenever the Motley Crue song 'Girls, Girls, Girls' was played. She said she could be fined £10 for each part of a song or whole song that she missed. She said she would earn up to £1,265 a night as wealthy customers stuffed prepaid vouchers called 'Heavenly money' into her garter. And she had to get a manager's approval for 'any agreement with a customer worth more than £300 to the dance'. At the end of each night, the club had to give Miss Quashie cash for the vouchers she accumulated - minus its fees and commissions and any fines. But Stringfellows revealed to the court how Miss Quashie actually paid them £65 a night - and ended up out of pocket if the club was quiet and punters refused to tip. It argued that her working terms were allegedly so miserly that she was 'often' paying the club to let her strip there rather than vice versa. Lawyers Stringfellows argued Nadine Quashie was not an employee because she had no obligation to work there . Court of Appeal judge Lord Justice Elias today ruled that the EAT made a 'plain error' in concluding that Stringfellows' obligations to Miss Quashie amounted to a contract of employment. He highlighted the evidence that 'the employer was under no obligation to pay the dancer anything at all'. Had Miss Quashie won today, thousands of strippers and lap dancers could have benefitted from her case. They have always been unable to sue even where they work long, regular hours under their club's control. After the judgment Miss Quashie said: 'I am saddened by the judgment but will continue to seek justice and better regulation in the industry. 'The status quo where dancers are denied their basic employment rights cannot continue. I think it is common sense that I was employed by them.' Her solicitor Shah Qureshi said: 'Nadine is naturally disappointed with the judgment and is considering an appeal to the Supreme Court.' Miss Quashie was a women's rights campaigner while studying accountancy and finance at Thames Valley University. She began her legal battle against Stringfellows after she was sacked in December 2008 over drug dealing allegations that she denies. Stringfellows denies that she had to give free dances to customers and has been vigorously contesting her claim of unfair dismissal.","Nadine Quashie, 29, ruled to have been self-employed so cannot sue the club .

A photographer fascinated by rural history has spent ten years touring the UK taking pictures of more than 170 shepherds' huts. Agricultural expert David Morris, 50, has travelled thousands of miles indulging his passion for the countryside. Shepherds' huts - or shepherds' wagons - were used for centuries by cattle herders during sheep raising and lambing. David Morris has spent 10 years touring Britain to take pictures of shepherd's huts such as this Howcroft showman's van from the late 1890s, which is believed to be one of the finest examples in existence . Agricultural expert Mr Morris has a passion for the huts which were used by cattle herders for centuries. Pictured left: A hut at RHS Chelsea 2012 and, right, a living van, used as a timber worker's crew hut . As well as British huts, Mr Morris has sourced pictures from abroad such as this American sheep wagon . Mr Morris has now gathered so many images he has created a book ‘Shepherds’ Huts & Living Vans’ celebrating the humble farming beginnings. The pictures feature huts of all shapes, sizes and designs from across the UK, as well as a number from France and America. Mr Morris, of Somerton, Somerset, said: 'I have always been fascinated [by] rural history. It is something I understand because I grew up in the heart of a rural community. 'I used to restore huts myself and inevitably the historian in me just wanted to look for more. Soon I had so much information I wasn’t sure what to do with it. 'It was only when the shepherds' huts started becoming popular that I decided to make a book out of them.' Mr Morris said his passion for shepherd's huts came from growing up in a rural community . The comfortable shepherds' huts are now making a comeback and are being used by campers . Mr Morris's collection of shepherds' huts pictures have now been published in a new book . The curator of Aircraft, at the Fleet Air Arm Museum, Somerset, added that he had found records of shepherds' huts dating back to 1467. In the 1800s, a shepherds' hut or living van would have been an unremarkable sight in many regions of rural Britain. But by the 1970s most lay abandoned as farming methods and industry left them behind. Today the humble shepherd’s hut is making a comeback and these quirky collectors' items are fast developing a cult status of their own.

Crawling is an evolutionary phenomenon which might have evolved 200-300 years ago thanks to wooden floors in houses, say experts. David Tracer, an anthropologist at the University of Colorado, has found that crawling is not what babies do everywhere across the world, and for good reason. Tracer’s discovery happened by accident, during his time in Papua New Guinea where he had been surveying the Au people since 1988 for studies on child and maternal health and nutrition. Modernisation: Crawling is an evolutionary phenomenon which might have evolved 200-300 years ago thanks to wooden floors in houses, say experts . Not worldwide: Crawling is not what babies do everywhere across the world . A Eurueka moment: Anthropologist David Tracer's discovery happened by accident, during his time in Papua New Guinea where he had been surveying the Au people since 1988 . He was told by one of his graduate students that the Au babies never seemed to be crawling. ‘That’s when the lightbulbs went off,’ says Tracer to PopularScience.com. The babies are carried by their mothers or siblings 86 per cent of the time during the infants' first 12 months, and when they are put down, the young children are usually placed in a sitting position, instead of prone on their stomachs. Au babies go through an upright ‘scooting’ or shuffling phase, in which they push themselves along with their hands while sitting on their backsides. The reason for this is because of parasites on the ground, which are common in the area the Au live. In . Africa, and other similar societies, preventing predator attacks is . similarly a reason why babies do not crawl and are carried throughout . their first year and then walk straight away after that. Safety first: Our closest relative, the apes, rarely put their babies on the ground, but instead teach them to crawl on their mothers¿ bellies . According to Tracer, crawling may have evolved around the same time as wooden floors in houses – only about 200-300 years ago. ‘For most of evolutionary history, kids were not put on the ground to shield them from pathogens or predation, so crawling is definitely the evolutionary novelty,’ says Tracer. Our closest relative, the apes, rarely put their babies on the ground, but instead teach them to crawl on their mothers’ bellies. ‘It almost seems to be there is some kind of phylogenetic heritage to not crawling,’ Tracer says.","Crawling might have evolved 200-300 years ago thanks to wooden floors in houses .

Buying petrol used to be a simple process of filling up your tank, paying the cashier and driving away. But it is set to become the latest shopping experience to bombard customers with a marketing ploy – by scanning their faces. Tesco is to use facial recognition technology to target advertising to each customer queuing at  their tills. Technology: Tesco is to use facial recognition devices to target advertising to customers queuing at their petrol stations . The devices – reminiscent of those seen in the science-fiction film Minority Report – will be rolled out at the supermarket’s petrol stations. Drivers’ ages and genders will be captured allowing the hi-tech screens to display adverts best suited to them. The OptimEyes scanners – developed by Lord Sugar’s company Amscreen, which is run by his eldest son Simon – will also use information such as the date, location and time to adjust which adverts are used. Each screen is fitted with an inbuilt camera which can automatically detect patterns and is programmed to recognise the human face. Life imitates art: The scanners echo the 2002 Hollywood blockbuster Minority Report, in which Tom Cruise¿s character is bombarded with advertising specifically designed for him . The system also has hundreds of visual characteristics stored, such as areas of shadow, logged as  ‘dark zones’, and distances between facial features. The ‘dark zones’ detected to the left and right of a chin, for example, signify long hair. A combination of these different ‘variables’ dictates whether the system identifies the customer as male or a female and within a certain age category. This is the first time the technology is being used in the UK. Amscreen already has contracts to display screen adverts in shops, banks, hospitals and doctors’ surgeries, but these do not use facial scanning technology that tailors the adverts to the people looking at the screen. The scanners echo the 2002 Hollywood blockbuster Minority Report, in which Tom Cruise’s character is bombarded with advertising specifically designed for him. Amscreen boss Simon Sugar said admitted that the device seemed like something from science fiction. Invention: The OptimEyes scanners have been developed by Lord Sugar's company Amscreen, which is run by his eldest son Simon . ‘Yes, it’s like something out of Minority Report, but this could change the face of British retail and our plans are to expand the screens into as many supermarkets as possible,’ he said. He insisted the technology does not store images or recognise individual people, but simply ‘works out gender and sorts customers into one of three age brackets’. The adverts will run for up to  ten seconds each, on a loop of  100 seconds. Mr Sugar added: ‘We’re extremely excited to call Tesco a screen network partner. We believe it’s our flexibility, reliability and measurability that has helped us secure this partnership. ‘For potential advertisers, this means we can now offer various digital advertising solutions to reach the sought-after Tesco shopper.’ The retail giant said the advertising platform would reach more than five million adult customers every week. Peter Cattell, a director for  Tesco petrol stations said: ‘We’re always looking to work with partners who provide innovative ways to enhance the customer shopping experience. ‘This new dynamic screen product from Amscreen provides the perfect means for us to do this. ‘The ability to tailor content based on time and location means it can be extremely useful and timely for our customers.’","Devices will be rolled out at supermarket's petrol stations .

The Melbourne Cup is one of the richest flat races in the world with a total prize money pot of around £4 million. Branded as the race that stops a nation, it has attracted riders, owners and horses from across the globe for decades. It started in 1861, won by a horse named Archer.

Officials watched the Harbord Harbord pub in Middleton, Greater Manchester, after a tip-off that contraband products were being secretly sold without bosses’ knowledge. They followed a suspected rogue dealer from the JD Wetherspoon's pub to a nearby house in Langley. Police found a stash of contraband cigarettes and Viagra-style tablets hidden in an armchair during a raid in Middleton, Greater Manchester . During a police raid at the property, a Samurai sword, a dagger and an air rifle were discovered. Officers also found 20,000 contraband cigarettes hidden in the lining of three sofas, behind books, in divan drawers and a bread bin. Among the concealed packets of Ronson cigarettes - allegedly being traded for around £3 each - were 40 kilos of hand-rolling tobacco and 800 sildigra-100 tablets, which are used to treat erectile dysfunction and are similar to Viagra. No duty had been paid on the cigarettes and hand-rolling tobacco, which was also said to be counterfeit. These illegal cigarettes were found at the house after officers watched the Harbord Harbord pub in Middleton after a tip-off that contraband products were being secretly sold without bosses' knowledge . A 58-year-old man was arrested and interviewed on suspicion of counterfeiting offences. He was released on bail pending further enquiries and must return to a police station next month. Estimates suggest Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs loses around £1.9billion of tax each year because of the huge trade in tobacco smuggling. The illicit trade is said to fund serious crime around Greater Manchester. Coun Jacqui Beswick, from Rochdale council, said: 'I would urge members of the public to report anything suspicious by phoning the citizens advice consumer service on 08454 04 05 06. Alternatively they can contact the police on 101.'","During raid a Samurai sword, a dagger and an air rifle were discovered .

Chief economist at The King's Fund John Appleby it is time to think more 'long-term' about health spending . Health and social care could account for half of all Government spending in 50 years’ time, warn leading analysts. By 2060, 50 per cent of UK public spending could be allocated to treating and caring for people - a stark rise from the 20 per cent currently spent. Analysts at The King’s Fund, an independent health policy body, based their predictions on economic growth and current levels of taxation and government expenditure. Population changes, increases in wealth and medical advances will put relentless pressure on health and social care spending in the future, says a new report. People living longer will also be a factor, but will play a smaller part than assumed. A massive rise in spending was not inevitable, said the report, but possible alternatives include controversial measures such as increased taxation or limiting the scope of publicly funded services. It calls for an ‘informed public debate’ about the choices, with ministers commissioning regular reviews of spending pressures. John Appleby, chief economist at The King’s Fund and author of the report, said ‘While there is nothing inevitable about spending on health and social care continuing to increase in line with historic trends, the pressure to spend more is likely to see it consuming an ever-larger proportion of national income. ‘It is time to think much more long-term about how much we should spend, the benefits of this spending and how it should be paid for. ‘By turning the spotlight on these issues now, we hope to stimulate an informed debate about the difficult choices ahead.’ The UK currently spends around 9 per cent of its national income on health and social care, more than twice as much as 50 years ago. This could more than double again to nearly 20 per cent by 2061, according to forecasts by the Office for Budget Responsibility. Based on projections for economic growth and current levels of taxation and government expenditure, the report estimates this would translate to around half of public spending. NHS Confederation chief executive Mike Farrar said the financial pressures ‘coming down the tracks’ meant there was an urgent need for a sustainable solution. He said ‘There is a growing consensus that the NHS must change to meet the needs of our changing population, make the most of healthcare technology, and live within its means. The UK currently spending nine per cent of national income on health and social care, more than twice as much as 50 years ago . ‘Addressing these issues will require . some tough choices and it is essential that we have open and honest . conversations with the public about what we can afford in the future and . how we will fund it. ‘We . urgently need an all-party debate about how we can establish a . sustainable health and social care system, with radical solutions very . much allowed.’ Dr Peter . Carter, Chief Executive & General Secretary of the Royal College of . Nursing said ‘The health care needs of the country are becoming more . complex and the NHS needs to adapt to these changes while maintaining its core principles.' ‘It is equally important, however, that increasingly scarce funds are not diverted from the frontline into major reorganisations. ‘Nursing staff are integral to supporting patients with long-term conditions and carrying out preventative work in communities. Removing these vital skills and services now is only going to cause greater problems, and higher costs, in the future. ‘We hope this report encourages a longer-term approach to workforce planning to ensure that there is the right number of staff and sufficient resources to effectively deal with patients’ needs.’ A Government spokesman said ‘While The Kings Fund’s predictions are speculative, we agree it is vital to look in detail at the long-term pressures placed on health spending. ‘That is why the Office for Budget Responsibility’s annual assessment of the future growth of health spending will continue to inform the decisions we take. These forecasts will help to ensure that the NHS is sustainable for the future and continues to meet the needs of the entire population.’","Analysts at The King's Fund made prediction based on economic growth, taxation and government spending .

So when police arrived at Lewes bonfire night wearing protective goggles, many thought it was rather an extreme precaution. However, all visitors to this year’s event in Sussex – the UK’s largest and most famous bonfire night – were urged by police to wear such safety goggles to avoid receiving any serious eye injuries. Sussex Police said that wearing goggles to firework displays is ‘a standard procedure if attending firework displays.’ Scroll down for video . Prepared: Police wear eye protection at the annual bonfire revelry in the Sussex town . Dazzling spectacle: Crowds cluster round as dozens of performers with burning torches perform a ceremony - without wearing goggles . All ages: Young participants in the festivities, which also link to the infamous Guy Fawkes Gunpowder Plot against the Houses of Parliament in 1605 . March of the flaming crosses: Lewes residents lined the streets in their hundreds to watch the procession of 17 flaming crosses to represent the Protestant martyrs burnt at the stake in the town in the 16th century . Spectacular show: Participants in the parade hold flaming torches to light up the chilly night air. Forecasters said tonight will be the coldest November 5 for over a decade . Religious connection: The flame procession in Lewes has its roots in the 16th century. In previous years, 80,000 people have lined the streets to watch as many as 3,000 marchers brandishing torches . Step back in time: The shops and buildings on the main streets of Lewes may have changed, but this is one annual tradition that holds strong . Showpiece: Crowds and marchers gathered around the Lewes war memorial to light crosses. An effigy of Guy Fawkes, who died in 1606 after an unsuccessful attempt to blow up Parliament, is also burnt . Last year, 170 people were injured and two visitors received eye injuries that left them permanently blinded. Around 20,000 people travelled by train to Lewes last night – with many more attending from the town itself. Torch-lit parades of people in a variety of outfits, many in period costume, walked through streets packed full with the crowds. A large effigy of Secretary of State for Education, Tory MP Michael Gove, was one of those that were burned. Several people were arrested for illegal possession of fireworks or other offensive weapons. The fiery procession traces its roots to the 16th-century reign of Mary I and the Guy Fawkes Gunpowder Plot of 1605. It . is just one of many November 5 gatherings up and down the country, . which illuminated the night sky with colourful pyrotechnics last night.

Protestant martyrs burnt at the stake in the town between 1555 and 1557 . as part of the Marian Prosecutions. The . purge was initiated by the Roman Catholic monarch Queen Mary, who . reigned between 1553 and 1558, and passed strict anti-Protestant . legislation against anyone guilty of heresy against the Pope. At least three hundred were martyred in just five years - many meeting a fiery end on the stake and others hung, drawn and quartered.

A fiery history: The seventeen flaming crosses in the parade represent the 17 martyrs who were burnt at the stake in Lewes as part of the Marian persecutions against Protestants in the reign of Mary I . History lesson: The Lewes Bonfire Night celebrations mark, in part, the Marian Persecutions of 1555-1557, a purge of Protestant religious reformers during the reign of Roman Catholic monarch Mary I. Heresy against the Catholic faith was punishable by death, with some burnt at the stake, as in Lewes, and other hung, drawn and quartered . While the flames remained alight in Lewes, others in the country saw their Bonfire Night pyrotechnics washed out by heavy rain. A number of fireworks displays were cancelled after heavy deluges of rain caused flash flooding, with Dorset, Devon, Somerset and Wiltshire the worst affected. It follows the cancellation of a number of large displays over the weekend, including one in Newham, East London and in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire.

The 20-year-old Newtown shooter Adam Lanza had been beaten and taunted by his fellow classmates while he was a student at Sandy Hook Elementary, and his mother had considered filing a lawsuit against the school, a relative has sensationally revealed. Speaking exclusively with the New York Daily News, the relative said that the man who would grow up to murder his mother, Nancy, was viciously bullied by his classmates and would come home from class with bruises over his body. Nancy Lanza was ‘irate’ in her belief that the educators at Sandy Hook weren’t doing all in their power to protect her son, they said. The relative told the Daily News that Lanza wouldn’t confide in his mother when she asked him what was wrong. ‘He would just sit there,’ the relative said. Scroll down for video .

Lanza shot dead 20 first graders and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14 in a matter of minutes, making it one of the worst school shootings in U.S. history. Last week, a never-before-seen . photograph of Lanza emerged, along with college records which include . new information about the gunman including that he refused to identify . his own gender when asked to do so in college documents. Lanza . attended Western Connecticut . State University for less than a year after his mom withdrew him from . Newtown High School when he still only 16. When asked his gender on a . student . background information form, Lanza wrote 'I choose not to answer.'

He . also wrote the same in response to the question: 'How do you describe . yourself?', according to records obtained by CBS News. The most recently discovered photo of Lanza was his student .

Students . and teacher who remember him from his WCSU days recall that he was very . quiet and struggled to mix with the other students although that was . largely attributed at the time to him being younger than them. He earned a 3.26 grade point average . while there, but WCSU after less than a year in 2009, he then attended a community . college, but also left that school after a year. Eventually, he worked at a . part-time job for a while repairing computers, but that job ended when . the business shut down. Documentation shows that Lanza refused to identify his own gender and to describe himself when asked by the college . Lanza walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut on December 14th and opened fire killing 26 people, including 20 children, before killing himself. He had killed his mother, Nancy Lanza, in her bed before heading to the school. A bipartisan legislative task force in Connecticut has agreed on a major overhaul of the state's gun laws in the aftermath of December's deadly attack. The draft legislation, announced on Monday, would add more than 100 types of guns to the state's list of banned assault weapons; limit the capacity of ammunition magazines to 10 rounds; ban armor-piercing bullets; require background checks for all weapon sales, including at gun shows; establish safety standards for school buildings; allow mental health training for teachers; and expand mental health research in the state. 'Nobody will be able to say that this bill is absolutely perfect, but no one will also be able to say that this bill fails the test when it comes to being the strongest in the country and the most comprehensive bill in the country,' Connecticut Senate President Don Williams, a Democrat and a member of the task force, said Monday. Last week, documents revealed how the 20-year-old Lanza sprayed 155 bullets at innocent children and educators during a five-minute . rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14. Denial: The NRA refutes the accuracy of the police evidence, saying both Lanza and his mother had no links to the group . The papers also revealed items seized from the home that Lanza shared with his mother. Investigators confiscated an NRA guide to shooting and . three other self-help books, 'Look at Me: My Life With Asperger's', . 'Born on a Blue Day: Inside the Mind of an Autistic Savant' and 'Train . Your Brain to Get Happy.' In a top drawer of a filing cabinet, . they found paper targets. In a duffel bag, they found ear and eye . protection, binoculars, numerous other paper targets and an NRA . certificate in his name. Another certificate was found in the home that belonged to Nancy Lanza, 52. In . response, the powerful gun-rights group denied the accuracy . of the police evidence, saying both Lanza and his mother had no links to the group. 'There is no record of a member . relationship between Newtown killer Adam Lanza, nor between Nancy Lanza, . A. Lanza or N. Lanza with the National Rifle Association. Reporting to . the contrary is reckless, false and defamatory,' the statement said. Roped off: Crime scene tape remained outside Nancy Lanza's Sandy Hook home days after the shooting; five search warrants and the corresponding documents were released last week . According to its website, the NRA doesn't offer formal certificates for membership. The police dossier compiled in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook massacre reveal Lanza had amassed an astonishing arsenal of guns, with thousands of rounds of ammunition, samurai swords, spears and three photographs of what appear to be a dead person covered in blood. Search warrant affidavits relating to the Newtown school shootings were unsealed by a judge in Danbury at 9.01am this morning - providing a chilling picture of the mass murderer in the days before he killed 26 people, including 20 children at the Connecticut school in December. The inventory of the evidence . seized from Lanza's home and the car he drove to carry out the massacre . provided glimpses into the world of a troubled young man, but it does . not answer the question of what could have motivated the attack. Investigators say it will take until June or later to complete the . investigation. Chief prosecutor Stephen Sedensky . confirmed that Lanza killed all 26 victims inside Sandy Hook Elementary . School with a Bushmaster .223-caliber rifle before taking his own life . with a Glock 10 mm handgun. He revealed Lanza had another loaded handgun with him inside the school as well as three, 30-round magazines for the Bushmaster. When . his body was discovered, Lanza's Bushmaster was loaded with 30-round . magazine of which 14 bullets still remained in place with one round in . the chamber.

Police and other officials stand outside Sandy Hook Elementary School in this aerial photograph a day after the mass shooting at the school in December of last year . Upon entering the school, the police documents state that law officials discovered, 'numerous school children and school personnel located deceased from apparent gunshot wounds in the first three classrooms off the main hallway, adjacent to the school's front entrance'. Adam Lanza's body was found dressed in military camouflage wearing a bullet-proof vest on the floor in the classroom. All the weapons Lanza was carrying were legally owned by his mother, Nancy, 52,  who was discovered dead in her bed on the second-floor of the house she shared with her son with a gunshot wound to her forehead and a rifle on the floor nearby. This new information from the police rules out any suggestion that Lanza tried to buy weapons himself before his massacre - which had been speculated previously. A loaded 12-gauge shotgun was also . found on the backseat of the Honda Civic Lanza drove to the school with . two magazines containing 70 rounds of Winchester 12-gauge shotgun . rounds. The Associated Press and other news outlets have reported previously that Lanza showed interest in other mass killings and authorities found literature on other massacres at his house. There have been reports that Lanza was obsessed with other mass killers, including Anders Breivik, who killed 77 people in a shooting and bomb attack in Norway two years ago. Among school shootings in the United States, the death toll from Newtown is second only to the 32 people killed at Virginia Tech in 2007. Malloy announced last week that additional information would be released at his request. He expressed concern that some information about the shooting rampage at Sandy Hook reportedly disclosed by a top state police commander at a recent law enforcement seminar in New Orleans was leaked. 'Like many others, I was disappointed and angered to learn that certain information about the Newtown shooting had been leaked, specifically with concern for the victims' families who may have been hearing this news for the first time,' the governor said in a statement. A column published last week in the New York Daily News, citing an unnamed police officer who attended the seminar, reported that Col Daniel Stebbins discussed evidence that suggested the Newtown gunman studied other mass slayings and dedicated extensive planning to the rampage. The seminar was designed for only law enforcement professionals, and sensitive information dealing with the tactical approaches used by first responders to the Sandy Hook shootings was discussed, Connecticut State Police spokesman Lt J. Paul Vance said. Senate President Donald E. Williams Jr. said this week that legislative leaders hope to review the search . warrant documents before finishing work on a bipartisan bill that . addresses gun control and other issues related to the massacre.

Sheep should be put out to graze on council-owned parks and fields to save the cost of mowers, town hall chiefs were advised yesterday. Cows and sheep could cut the grass without the expense of petrol, mowing machines and workers to drive them, a report said. And it also recommended sending children in care to boarding schools rather than expecting them to live in care homes. Suggestion: A report from the TaxPayer's Alliance has suggested sheep could be put out to graze on council-owned parks and fields to save the cost of mowers . School ties: The report also recommended sending children in care to boarding schools, which would be cheaper than expecting them to live in care homes . The advice said independent schools would be better and cheaper than the care homes and care units used by local authorities, where costs to taxpayers can often rise higher than the fees of the most expensive public schools. The report also called for parking wardens to be made to pay to park their own cars when they drive to work. They should have to pay the price for using taxpayer-run car parks in just the same way as the shoppers and commuters whose cars they ticket, it said. Recommendations: Communities Secretary Eric Pickles urged town halls to follow the advice . According to the report from the TaxPayers’ Alliance pressure group, local authority employees could also contribute in 198 other ways to keeping council tax bills down. Ideas for saving money run from replacing bottled mineral water in meetings with tap water to sacking staff who abuse their taxpayer-backed official credit cards. Councils, it said, should remove road humps and speed cameras, stop town twinning schemes, sack their climate change officers, and scrap the lady mayoress’ clothing allowance. They should also consider saving money by encouraging council tenants to do their own repairs. The 201 ideas were put forward by the public spending pressure group the TaxPayers’ Alliance with the aim of nudging councils towards giving better value for money. It warned that unless local authorities draw up schemes to cut waste there will be growing pressure for increases in council tax, which has already doubled in a decade. An average Band D bill in England is now £1,456 a year. The list of ideas was drawn up by Harry Phibbs, a Tory councillor in Hammersmith and Fulham in London, who said it included items that ‘could be shrugged off as mere common sense - missing the point that common sense is a rare and precious commodity in local government.’ Communities Secretary Eric Pickles urged town halls to follow the advice. ‘This report exposes how there is still massive waste in the public sector,’ Mr Pickles said. ‘There is significant scope for town halls to save taxpayers’ money, helping keep council tax down and protect frontline services. Councils which complain about so-called cuts need to read through this report and justify their spending to local taxpayers. Central government could learn many a practical tip from this too.’ Councils, the money-saving tip sheet . said, could get rid of political advisers, freeze staff recruitment, and . reduce the number of their press officers to match the number of . reporters on their local newspapers. If they do have to recruit, they . can save money by advertising on their own websites rather than in the . Guardian. They should stop paying for translators, diversity officers, fair trade co-ordinators, five-a-day co-ordinators, work experience co-ordinators, and European officers. They could then save money by cancelling frivolous award ceremonies organised to make pointless staff think they have achieved something. There should also be an end to subscriptions for strings of umbrella organisations, including the Local Government Association, which charges some councils as much as £80,000 a year for membership. Councils should withdraw funding from ‘sock puppet’ charities - fake charities which exist to promote political agendas and which rely on taxpayer subsidies. Mr Phibbs said: ‘Some items, such as outsourcing, sharing services and debt interest reduction, can each amount to tens or even hundreds of millions of pounds in annual savings for larger local authorities. ‘This amounts to more than a checklist. It is trying to engender an attitude of getting value for taxpayers’ money.’ The . ideas were condemned by the union Unite. The union, which includes . council workers among its members, said it would be dangerous for . tenants to try to carry out their own electrical repairs. Unite local government officer Fiona Farmer said: ‘The credibility of the TaxPayers’ Alliance has to be seriously questioned when ideas taken from medieval times, such as grazing sheep, are wheeled out in its endless quest for publicity. ‘Has the Alliance worked out how much it is going to cost to buy these animals and pay the substantial veterinary bills? ‘The prospect we face is hundreds of these animals freely roaming around municipal parks ignoring health and safety considerations when children are playing - and being a prime target for urban rustlers.’","TaxPayer's Alliance pressure group put forward 199 ways to save money .

Repairing: Buildings are beginning to be restored in the old part of Mostar following the bloody war between 1992 and 1995 . The conflict centred on whether Bosnia should stay in the Yugoslav Federation, or whether it should become independent. It is now an independent state but under international administration. Its three main ethnic groups are Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims), Croats and Serbs. The war left Bosnia's infrastructure and economy in tatters and around two million people were displaced. Some 100,000 people died and two million people were forced from their homes during ethnic cleansing. The Mehmed Pasina mosque was badly damaged during the Bosnian war but 21 years on and it has been restored . Slow intervention eventually brought peace, but at the cost of ethnic segregation dividing the country between Serbs, Croats and Muslims. And there are still visible signs of Mostar's troubled history. Bosnia has absorbed some 9 billion euros in foreign aid to help it heal from the war, yet Mostar, a town of 70,000 people, has resisted reconciliation. Each side still has its own electricity provider, phone network, postal service, utility services and university. People walk past damaged buildings on the main Marsala Tita street in Mostar in June 1993 but some buildings have now been rebuilt . War-torn: People had to prepare themselves to walk over the bridge in Mostar in 1993 but now it has been rebuilt . Croat and Bosniak schoolchildren attend separate classes, studying from different textbooks. The . latest row over how to reform the electoral code is rooted in a fear by . Bosniaks, who are the minority in Mostar, that they will be dominated . by the Croats. The Bosniaks want safeguards to make sure they are not out-voted. The Croats, in the majority, want the town unified. 'In . a few months Mostar will be just 25 miles from the EU, and we should be . heading towards modern Europe and not back to the Middle Ages,' said . Sladjan Bevanda, a local Croat political leader, told Reuters. Slow intervention eventually brought peace, but at the cost of ethnic segregation dividing the country between Serbs, Croats and Muslims .","Mostar was the most heavily-bombed of any Bosnian city between 1992 and 1995 .

The parents of a star high school athlete who was shot and killed by a neighbor when the 16-year-old crawled into the wrong house in his neighborhood have forgiven the man who killed their son. Shawn and Jennea Gordley today said that they do not blame their son's killer, adding that they understand why Caleb was killed in the upscale northern Virginia neighborhood of Sterling. Police say that Caleb Gordley sneaked out of his parents' house on Saturday night to drink with his high school friends. The basketball star walked back to his neighborhood, hopped a fence and crawled in a back window in the early morning hours. He didn't realize, though, that the house he had entered was not his own home, but rather one that was two doors down from where he lived. Fallen: Caleb Gordley, 16, was shot and killed at around 2.30am on Sunday morning when he entered his neighbour's home two doors down from his own, seemingly by mistake, after a night of drinking with friends . Mourning: Shawn and Jennea Gordley forgave the neighbor who shot and killed their son . The owner, fearing a prowler, shot and killed Caleb. 'I just want you to know I forgive you. I understand this was an accident,' Caleb's mother Jennae Gordley said, according to WJLA-TV. 'I do, too,' father Shawn Gordley added. 'All the answers in the world are not going to bring him back.' Mr Gordley added that he only hopes his son wasn't scared the moment he was killed by the startled neighbor. 'We got 16-and-a-half awesome years out of that young man. And I will hold on to that,' the heartbroken father said. Friends of the teen's are calling the fatal shooting a terrible accident and saying that after a night of drinking, he must have mistaken the house for his own seeing as they are almost identical from behind and he had only lived in the area for a year. 'Knowing Caleb, he wouldn't have bad intentions,' said one in an interview with WUSA9. 'He was a good kid.' Those who know Donald West Wilder II, the homeowner of the property where the incident took place, meanwhile spoke highly of the community-minded firefighter, adding further mystery to the alleged mix-up. According to sources at Park View High School where Gordley was a student, the victim had been out drinking with friends until late on Saturday night and had been dropped off at the quiet Sterling, Virginia cul-de-sac where he lived,  at around 2.30am. Close: Because of the proximity of the houses and the fact that they appear similar at night time, investigators think he may have accidentally gone into the wrong home at the time he was shot . Lookalikes: The star athlete lived in this Sterling, Virginia cul-de sac in the house on the right and may have thought his neighbour's home was his own according to friends . Tragic error? Donald West Wilder II, the owner of the house just two doors down (left) shot the teen thinking he was an intruder after calling 911 but details are still murky as police continue to investigate . For reasons unknown, however, the . popular basketball player and promising rapper went to Mr Wilder's house . and tried to enter instead of his own. Some reports suggest that he may have entered through a back window and set off a security alarm. Though the Loudon County Sheriff's office continues to investigate before confirming details, one law enforcement official told the Washington Post that Gordley had attempted to walk upstairs where the family were sleeping before he was shot. Hearing an intruder, Mr Wilder called 911 to report the break-in but by the time authorities reached the property, a large mansion-style two-storey home on the 45900 block of Pullman Court, Gordely was already dead. Mystery visit: An unidentified man tried to talk to someone at the house where the incident took place but after gesticulating wildly was shut out . Escape: After fleeing in his car, he backed up the street in reverse and ran into the house where Gordley lived with his family . Virginia law permits homeowners to use deadly force if they feel threatened inside their own homes. Neighbour . Joanna Roman, could not understand the tragedy. She described Mr Wilder . as 'a great neighbor, a helper, someone who spends spare time . volunteering to help others. He's an active member of our community. He's a good person.' Similarly, another Pullman Court resident, Khang Nguyen, called Mr Wilder a 'very nice gentleman, very quiet, too.' Star: Gordley was described by students and coaches as an excellent athlete, a popular boy and a gifted rapper who had good intentions . Meanwhile, students and friends of the slain teen have rallied to his defence, calling the shooting 'shocking'. 'He was on the basketball team, baseball... he brought happiness to the whole team,' said one friend. A heartbroken classmate told NBC: 'If you had classes with him, there was no way you weren't leaving that class without a smile.' A promising rap artist as well as a regular fixture on the sports scene, Gordley had been living in the Sterling cul-de-sac with his famly for about a year. Some neighbours admitted that they didn't know the family well and saw other tenants coming and going from the Gordley home since they had moved in. Both their home and Mr Wilder's were built at the same time and look almost identical which may explain the confusion if Caleb Gordley was intoxicated. A full toxicology report is still pending. Earlier today an unidentified man visited the house where the shooting took place and had a confrontation with a man who answered the door. He gesticulated wildly before the man closed the door and then getting in a car, backed up the street, lept out and ran into the home of Caleb Gordley. Police cars returned to the scene and officers were seen coming and going between the two properties all afternoon. At Park View High School meanwhile, grief counselors were on call and an assembly to remember Gordley was arranged for the mourning youngsters who will miss their friend.","Caleb Gordley, a junior at Park View High in Sterling, Virginia was a popular student and star athlete .

Almost half of Britons think the right to work and live in the UK should be blocked for Romanians and Bulgarians, a survey has shown. It comes as Downing Street confirmed it is looking at a possible extension of the length of time new arrivals from the EU have to stay in the UK before claiming benefits. And the Romanian foreign minister urged David Cameron to reject the ‘racist attitudes’ which can dominate the political debate on immigration. The UK government is under pressure to curb entry to the UK when EU restrictions on Romanians and Bulgarians coming here to work are lifted in January . Concerns have been raised in Westminster over the numbers of Romanians and Bulgarians who might come to the UK when movement controls imposed when they joined the European Union expire in January. But Mr Cameron’s official spokesman appeared to reject suggestions the Prime Minister was prepared to defy European courts to impose tougher conditions. ‘The Government acts within the law,’ he told reporters. However it was confirmed that the government is considering extending the amount of time migrants have to be in the UK before they can claim benefits from three months to a year. Mr Cameron's official spokesman told a regular Westminster media briefing: ‘You would expect the Government to be looking at whether there is more that could be done. That process is, as you would expect, going on.’ However he refused to comment on when a decision might be made or what changes might be introduced. David Cameron is considering extending the amount of time migrants have to be in the UK before they can claim benefits . Any extension of the bar on benefits would potentially set up a clash with Brussels and a row within the coalition Government. The European Commission prevents member states from discriminating between their own citizens and those from other European Union members. Meanwhile, an opinion poll for Channel 5 News found 47 per cent of people thought migrants from the two countries should have no right to live, work or claim benefits in the UK and 56 per cent believed immigration had resulted in a negative impact on Britain. One in four people surveyed in the Chancel 5 News poll thought Romanians and Bulgarians should be treated the same as other EU citizens and 18 per cent thought they should have more limited rights to live, work and access welfare in the UK. A third of people surveyed over-estimated the percentage of people born outside the UK living in the country, thinking the figure was over 40 per cent, rather than the 13 per cent indicated in the 2011 census. More than a quarter (27 per cent) of those surveyed said Ukip had the best immigration policies, followed by Labour on 18 per cent, the Tories on 12 per cent and Lib Dems on 7 per cent. Romania's Foreign Minister, Titus Corlatean told Channel 5 News he did not expect a ‘flood’ of migrants from his country to come to Britain after January 1 and attacked the way the immigration debate had been conducted in the UK. He said Mr Cameron should reject ‘in clear terms if it's possible the xenophobic and populistic and once again sometimes racist attitudes which are promoted by some other British politicians’. The Bulgarian ambassador to the UK, Konstantin Dimitrov, also accused some politicians of making ‘highly unacceptable ... prejudicial’ comments about his countrymen. Bulgarian Ambassador Konstantin Dimitrov said he had not heard of any Bulgarians being prevented from working in the UK . Mr Dimitrov told the Daily Telegraph that Bulgarians moving to Britain should not be described as ‘immigrants’. ‘Bulgarians are not immigrants,’ he said. ‘Bulgarians are members of the European Union and are moving freely inside the EU, including the UK.’ Although the transitional controls on freedom of movement remain in place until the end of the year, Mr Dimitrov said he had not heard of any Bulgarians being prevented from working in the UK. He said: ‘In other words, most of all those who wanted to work here, especially since we became a member of the EU in 2007, have managed to do so.’ Occasionally, applications for accession worker cards were turned down but this was for technical reasons such as failure to provide the necessary qualifications, he told the newspaper. :: Channel 5 News carried out an online survey of 1,006 adults from England, Scotland and Wales.

The Church of England will acknowledge its ‘deep grief and shame’ over clerical sex abuse today when it votes to make an historic apology to victims. The move comes as The Mail on Sunday has learned of proposals being actively considered by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby for the Church to set up its first national commission on abuse. In a strongly-worded joint statement issued before today’s vote at Church ruling body the General Synod, Archbishop Welby and the Archbishop of York John Sentamu said the suffering inflicted on children, young people and adults ‘is and will remain a deep source of grief and shame for years to come’. The Synod, meeting in York, is expected to back a motion offering an ‘unreserved’ apology to victims after a series of shocking cases involving senior clergy. Apology: The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby is behind the statement which speaks of the Church's 'grief and shame' It is also set to endorse a major overhaul of its laws and procedures surrounding abuse claims, and insiders said this could include allowing clergy to break the sacrosanct seal of confession – which, although not widespread, is heard in some C of E churches – so they could report major crimes they are told about in the confessional. The significance of today’s debate was underlined by the Archbishops’ statement in which they urge the Synod to fully support the apology, saying: ‘We cannot overestimate the importance of responding appropriately today.’ Their statement said a recent report on abuse cases in one diocese, which warned the Church that it faced a ticking ‘time bomb’, had exposed a ‘painful story of individual wickedness on the part of abusers. ‘It also highlights very serious and serial systemic failures by the Church in dealing properly with information about abuse as well as great suffering on the part of those who not only experienced abuse but then had to struggle for far too long before they were properly listened to.’ The motion, which will be debated this afternoon, urges the Synod to ‘endorse the Archbishops’ statement expressing on behalf of the Church of England an unreserved apology for the failure of its systems to protect children, young people and adults from physical and sexual abuse inflicted by its clergy and others, and for the failure to listen properly to those so abused’. It is only the second time the Synod has been asked to apologise to victims, the first being in 2006 over the Church’s involvement in the slave trade, and Synod members said it was ‘a big step’. 'There have been so many cover-ups, and . the Church is not taking the concerns of survivors seriously that there . is something fundamentally wrong in the system.' - Anne Lawrence, campaigner and clergy abuse victim . The debate follows a string of convictions of clergy who abused scores of victims, and the arrest of former Bishop of Gloucester Peter Ball as well as accusations of a cover up against the retired Archbishop of York, Lord Hope. Senior Church figures are braced for further revelations as more victims break their silence about historic cases, mainly dating from the 1970s and 80s. Archbishop Welby and senior bishops are determined to tackle the issue before it further damages the Church amid accusations that its leaders’ first instincts were to protect its reputation rather than help victims. However, campaigners say an apology from the Synod will be insufficient without a Government-led public inquiry to uncover the full extent of the abuse, and they are angry they have been refused permission to speak in today’s debate. Campaigner and clergy abuse victim Anne Lawrence, who will be at the debate, said the extent of the failings in the Church were ‘as if we had dozens of clerical Jimmy Saviles in the parishes and many of them were known about but nothing happened. It is appalling’. Ms Lawrence said: ‘There have been so many cover-ups, and the Church is not taking the concerns of survivors seriously that there is something fundamentally wrong in the system. The Church is a powerful institution with moral authority but it has used that authority to cover-up serious crimes. There are so many unanswered questions.’ Vote: The joint statement by the Archbishop of Canterbury and Archbishop of York John Sentamu will be put to the General Synod today . The Church has carried out a number of inquiries, including in 2008 a review of files to assess the handling of any past concerns about child protection, but victims say these steps are not sufficient. Sources said the proposed new ‘truth and reconciliation’ commission, which is at a very early stage, would not be an exact parallel to that set up in post-apartheid South Africa, which was presided over by Archbishop Desmond Tutu in the 1980s. But one said that, if it went ahead, it would provide ‘a process of the Church facing the truth that it didn’t do its job properly. It would involve representatives of the Church meeting survivors and acknowledging their responsibility and taking steps to enable survivors to move on’. He said: ‘The outcome should be that survivors come away feeling they have been heard and respected and there has been some measure of justice. We are at a moment in history where more and more people are coming forward. In the end the reputation of the Church is undermined by a denial of the truth.’ The bishop in charge of the Church’s safeguarding policies, the Bishop of Southwell and Nottingham Paul Butler, said: ‘The idea of a truth and reconciliation commission is one of a number of ideas being suggested in our continuing work with survivors. ‘After the Synod debate we will reflect on all suggestions but our main concern is for the survivors and what will be the most beneficial in the future. We will be in discussion with survivor groups on any future initiatives. At the Synod we will vote on ways to tighten up our procedures as well as offering an unreserved apology for the failure of its systems and for the failure to listen properly.’","General Synod expected to back motion offering 'unreserved' apology .

Joy Of Sex author Susan Quilliam says divorced middle-aged women are free to enjoy 'full and active sex lives' that were denied to previous generations . Getting divorced in middle age used to leave many women feeling they had been denied a love-life for ever. But today’s ‘silver splitters’ have full and active sex lives that were denied to previous generations, an expert says. Susan Quilliam, who rewrote The Joy Of Sex to celebrate the book’s 40th anniversary, said women can now sleep with whoever they want after their marriage breaks down and not be judged. The psychologist and sexual relationships expert, who herself has become single at 63 after her 21-year marriage ended, said women no longer fear experimenting with men in bed. ‘In theory, I can, if I so wish, go out and sleep with somebody tonight without opprobrium, without being told I’m a slut,’ she told Cambridge University’s Festival of Ideas. ‘Well, there are some people who will still think I’m a slut, but largely we are lucky. Us women in 2013, we are lucky as no other women before us. ‘We are lucky post Pill and post the Abortion Act to be able to know and decide where, what, who, how and also whether and where to look for sex – and where things are and what to do with them.’ Miss Quilliam, from Cambridge, married her former husband Ian Grove-Stephensen, 56, in 1992. They have no children. Last year she updated the ground-breaking self-help sex manual The Joy Of Sex by Alex Comfort, to celebrate 40 years since it provoked scandal when it was first published in 1972. Miss Quilliam said: ‘Compared to our mothers’ and grandmothers’ generations we have more choice. ‘More choice to have a relationship or not. The choice of whether to have a short-term relationship of just a few hours or a long-term one. ‘We can also choose who we partner with. Our grandparents’ generation was firmly told they had to partner with someone of their own class and age. Wedding: Miss Quilliam, from Cambridge, married her ex-husband Ian Grove-Stephensen, 56, in 1992, left.  She has declined to comment on whether she is currently in any kind of relationship . ‘We can choose a partner who is younger or older, people who do not come from the same background or even the same continent. ‘When the original book came out in 1972, women who were over 50 or 60 years old were seen as past it, whereas they are now seen as attractive. We can have full and active sex lives. I know a lot of women over 50 with good sex lives. ‘Women have become more powerful in society and because of this increase in power have been able to set the rules more. Society is more mature and experience in the bedroom is now seen as being just as compelling as being attractive. Work: Last year, Miss Quilliam rewrote the self-help sex book The Joy Of Sex by Alex Comfort, left, to celebrate its 40th anniversary. Right, her updated version of the manual . ‘Older women now know a lot more about our bodies and how to please a man.’ Miss Quilliam said that in the past women who were widowed felt unable to go out and find a new partner, but she said this has changed. She said: ‘Women do not have to be afraid. They can grab their own life by the scruff of the neck and think, “Let’s do this”. That’s something my mother and grandmother were not able to do.’ Miss Quilliam declined to comment on whether she is currently in any kind of relationship.","Susan Quilliam, 63, rewrote The Joy Of Sex to celebrate 40th anniversary .

"By . Steve Doughty . UPDATED: . 18:03 EST, 29 December 2011 . Taxpayers are funding aid to Brazil even though it has become richer than Britain, Whitehall officials admitted yesterday. Millions has been handed over in development aid in recent years despite the rapid rise of Brazil to the top rank of world economies. And money is still going to the Latin American powerhouse in the week it was revealed to have overtaken Britain in the world’s economic league table. Good times: Brazil, famous for its carnival in Rio de Janeiro (pictured), overtook Britain in the world's economic league table . The continuing aid to Brazil comes against a background of deepening criticism of the Coalition’s foreign aid plans and its determination to keep raising spending on development in supposedly poor countries. David Cameron and his ministers are pledged to raise aid spending, currently worth £9billion a year and 0.57 per cent of national income, to 0.7 per cent. Aid spending went up by £1.24billion in the last financial year alone. Yet money continues to be poured into wealthy and fast-growing countries  such as India, and even aid to China, second in the world economic league, was ordered to come to an end only this year. Much of the money which does go to genuinely poor countries is said by some analysts to be soaked up in corruption or pointless projects. Brazil was this week listed as sixth in the world economic league table by the Centre for Economics and Business Research. The City think tank found that the country’s economy will produce more than $2.5trillion this year, pushing ahead of UK economic product, which will be just under the $2.5trillion mark. According to figures on the website of the Department For International Development, £13.6million worth of taxpayer-funded development schemes for Brazil remain ‘operational’. They include a scheme to work up environmental projects billed at almost £9million, another to ‘improve flexibility, agility and responsiveness in the implementation of DFID regional objectives’ worth more than £1.2million, and unidentified schemes costing more than £2.4million. DFID officials said yesterday that the spending was ‘historic’ and included projects dating from the 1990s, and that they were listed as remaining in operation only because of ‘an IT error’. But they acknowledged that taxpayers’ money is still going in aid to Brazil, in the form of a £730,000 ‘large emerging economies programme’ to ‘develop a shared agenda and promote global poverty reduction objectives.’ This project, DFID said, is to be wound down ‘at the earliest opportunity’. Tory MP Douglas Carswell said the figures showed the ministry was ‘not about helping economies to grow’. He added: ‘Aid spending is more about the commitment of DFID officials to expanding their own budgets than helping economic growth. Powerhouse: Brazil has been listed as sixth in the world economic league table by the Centre for Economics and Business Research . ‘If we really wanted to help economic growth in poor countries we would do it through free trade and cutting tariffs.’ Robert Oxley, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘The international aid budget is full of too many contradictions like this. Why should British taxpayers fund aid programmes in an economy bigger than our own?’ ‘DFID should cut its subsidies to countries who don’t need it and focus on helping the world’s poorest. It’s no surprise that the Brazil has leapfrogged the UK’s economy when ours is still tied down by red tape and plagued by interfering politicians.’ In March, ministers announced the end of development aid to 16 countries considered no longer to need it. They included China, Russia, Vietnam, Serbia and Iraq – but Brazil was not mentioned. A DFID spokesman said: ‘These are old projects in Brazil, most of which date back to the 1990s.’ Population    -       62,262,000 .

This incredible photo shows radio signals glowing blue from the spacecraft Voyager 1 nearly 12 billion miles away. Scientists can't actually see the spacecraft but they can detect its radio light. They used the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) a network of powerful radio telescopes to pick up the signal which looks like a blue speck. It is believed this image was taken on February 21 this year. Suzanne Dodd, Voyager's project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said: 'This image represents the Voyager radio signal as seen by the world's most sensitive ground-based telescope. Outer space: The Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), a network of radio telescopes operated by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, spotted the signal of NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft from 11.5 billion miles away . 'It's just a speck in amongst a sea of darkness.' Earlier today a sound recording was sent back to Earth from the spacecraft as it crossed a new frontier becoming the first spacecraft to ever leave the solar system. The rising tones NASA observed are made by the vibration of dense plasma or ionised gas and were captured by the probe's plasma wave instrument. Speaking in a news conference, Don Gurnett, principle investigator for the Voyager plasma wave investigation, said: 'When you hear this recording, please recognise that this is an historic event. It's the first time that we've ever made a recording of sounds in interstellar space.' Scroll down for video . Somewhere out there: Voyager 1 spacecraft barreling through space. The space agency announced today that Voyager 1 has become the first spacecraft to enter interstellar space, or the space between stars . Voyager 1's current mission, along with Voyager 2, is to explore the outermost edge of the Sun's domain and beyond . NASA officials added: 'There were two times the instrument heard these vibrations: October to November 2012 and April to May 2013. 'Scientists noticed that each occurrence involved a rising tone. The dashed line indicates that the rising tones follow the same slope. This means a continuously increasing density.' A team still stays in contact with the two Voyager spacecraft every day but Voyager 1's extreme distance, currently around 12 billion miles from Earth, means a message takes 17 hours to reach us. Thirty-six years after it was . launched from Earth on a tour of the outer planets, the . plutonium-powered probe is more than 11 1/2 billion miles from the sun, . cruising through what scientists call interstellar space — the vast, . cold emptiness between the stars, the space agency said. Voyager 1 actually made its exit more . than a year ago, according to NASA. But it's not as if there's a dotted . boundary line out there or a signpost, and it was not until recently . that the space agency had the evidence to convince it of what an outside . research team had claimed last month: that the spacecraft had finally . plowed through the hot plasma bubble surrounding the planets and escaped . the sun's influence. While some scientists said they remain unconvinced, NASA celebrated. 'It's a milestone and the beginning . of a new journey,' said mission chief scientist Ed Stone at NASA's Jet . Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. Voyager 1 will now study exotic . particles and other phenomena in a never-before-explored part of the . universe and radio the data back to Earth, where the Voyager team awaits . the starship's discoveries. The interstellar ambassador also . carries a gold-plated disc containing multicultural greetings, songs and . photos, just in case it bumps into an intelligent species. This artist's concept shows NASA's two Voyager spacecraft exploring a turbulent region of space known as the heliosheath, the outer shell of the bubble of charged particles around our sun . It is 36 years since the twin Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft were launched and the pair continue to explore where . nothing from Earth has flown before. Their primary mission was the exploration of Jupiter and Saturn. After . making a string of discoveries there -- such as active volcanoes on . Jupiter's moon Io and intricacies of Saturn's rings -- the mission was . extended. Voyager 2 went on to explore Uranus and Neptune, and is still the only spacecraft to have visited those outer planets. The . current mission for both spacecraft, the Voyager Interstellar Mission, . is to explore the outermost edge of the Sun's domain and beyond. Voyager 1's odyssey began in 1977 . when the spacecraft and its twin, Voyager 2, were launched on a tour of . the gas giant planets of the solar system. After beaming back dazzling . postcard views of Jupiter's giant red spot and Saturn's shimmering . rings, Voyager 2 hopscotched to Uranus and Neptune. Meanwhile, Voyager 1 . used Saturn as a gravitational slingshot to power itself past Pluto. Voyager 1, which is about the size of . a subcompact car, carries instruments that study magnetic fields, . cosmic rays and solar wind. Last year, scientists monitoring . Voyager 1 noticed strange happenings that suggested the spacecraft had . broken through: Charged particles streaming from the sun suddenly . vanished. At the same time, there was a spike in galactic cosmic rays . bursting in from the outside. Since there was no detectable change . in the direction of the magnetic field lines, the team assumed the . far-flung craft was still in the heliosphere, or the vast bubble of . charged particles around the sun . Voyager is bathed in solar wind from the southern hemisphere flowing northward . The Voyager team patiently waited for . a change in magnetic field direction — thought to be the telltale sign . of a cosmic border crossing. But in the meantime, a chance solar . eruption caused the space around Voyager 1 to echo like a bell last . spring and provided the scientists with the data they needed, convincing . them the boundary had been crossed in August of last year. 'It took us 10 seconds to realize we . were in interstellar space,' said Don Gurnett, a Voyager scientist at . the University of Iowa who led the new research, published online in the . journal Science. The new observations are fascinating, . but 'it's premature to judge,' said Lennard Fisk, a space science . professor at the University of Michigan and former NASA associate . administrator who was not part of the team. 'Can we wait a little while . longer? Maybe this picture will clear up the farther we go.' Voyager 1 is capable of returning scientific data from a full range of instruments, with adequate electrical power and attitude control propellant to keep operating until 2020. What bothers Fisk is the absence of a change in magnetic field direction. Harvard astrophysicist Jonathan . McDowell was more blunt: 'I'm actually not going to believe it for . another year or two until it's been solidly outside for a while.' While Voyager 1 may have left the . solar system as most people understand it, it still has thousands of . years to go before bidding adieu to the last icy bodies that make up our . neighborhood. Voyager 2 trails behind at 9 1/2 . billion miles from the sun. It may take another three years before . Voyager 2 joins its twin on the other side.

Shocking footage has emerged of young children and adults suffering horrific burns and caked in a 'napalm-like' substance after a bomb was dropped on a school playground in northern Syria. Witnesses told a team from the BBC’s Panorama programme that a fighter jet had repeatedly flown overhead, as if searching for a target, before dropping the bomb. The disturbing film came to light just hours after MPs voted against military action in Syria, following a chemical attack near Damascus on August 21. Bombing horror: A BBC Panorama team has released footage showing the aftermath of a 'napalm-like' bomb dropped on a school playground in Syria . In the latest attack, which reduced the school playground to mere rubble, more than ten pupils were killed and many more left seriously injured. Those who survived are seen shaking uncontrollably and appear to have suffered burns to more than 50 percent of their bodies. Both adults and children are hurriedly taken into a basic hospital, where the patients are treated on the floor. According to the BBC, their injuries have been caused by a bomb containing a chemical similar to napalm or thermite. The school's distraught headmaster told reporters: 'This was the most horrific thing. We have seen images on TV, we have heard many stories, but we have never seen anything like this before. 'The worst thing in life is watching someone die right in front of you and you can’t do anything. 'There were dead people, people burning and people running away, but where to? Where would they go? It is not safe anywhere. That is the fate of the Syrian people.' A British medic, Dr Rola, who is in Syria with the charity Hand In Hand, treated the victims at the hospital. She said: 'It is just absolute chaos and carnage here. We have had a massive influx of what looks like serious burns, seems like it must be some sort of, not really sure, maybe napalm, something similar to that. 'But obviously within the chaos of the situation it is very difficult to know exactly what is going on.' She added later: 'We feel like some sort of, not even a second class citizen, like we just don’t matter. 'Like all of these children, and all of these people who are being killed and massacred, we don’t matter. 'The whole world has failed our nation and it is innocent civilians who are paying the price.' Horrific injuries: Many of the victims suffered burns covering more than 50 percent of their bodies. Even children like this terribly burned, shaking 15-year-old may count themselves lucky . Meanwhile Mohammed Abdullatif, who witnessed the attack, had a message for the United Nations. 'Dear United Nations, you are calling peace, you are calling for peace. What kind of peace are you calling for? 'Don’t you see this, don’t you see this? What do you need to see? 'We are just human beings, we want to live. It is our right to live,' he said. After viewing the footage, Gareth Owen, humanitarian director of Save the Children, said: 'The BBC's shocking report on the alleged napalm attack on children in a school in northern Syria, shows how schools - which should be places of safety for children - have become targets in this bitter conflict. 'In Syria, nearly 4,000 schools have been destroyed, damaged or occupied since the start of the conflict. 'In many places, children are either too frightened to go to school, or there are no longer any schools to go to. 'Save the Children is helping communities in Syria by keeping schools open where possible and setting up temporary learning spaces where they are not, so 14,000 children can access safe education. 'But we want to do much more. That's why we are urgently calling for unfettered humanitarian access to all parts of Syria, to ensure Syria children are not deprived of the fundamental right to an education.' Distressed: Survivors of the attack were taken to a basic hospital and treated on the floor, where they writhed in pain . Meanwhile, the UN investigation team in Syria to probe the alleged use of chemical weapons in the country have completed their research and are due to leave Damascus tomorrow. Led by Swedish specialist Ake Sellstrom, the team was initially sent to investigate the alleged chemical weapons attack on Khan al-Asal in the Aleppo region on March 19 and two other sites. They later headed to the Damascus suburb of Ghouta, where chemical weapons were allegedly used on August 21, to collect evidence. Up to 1,200 people were killed - including many children - during the horrific attack. Syria has vehemently denied it used stocks of sarin to shell the area.

Forgotten man: The work of Alfred Russel Wallace, pictured, dubbed the 'forgotten father' of evolution, is set to be celebrated by the Natural History Museum in London . While his colleague Charles Darwin is revered as one of the greatest British scientists ever to have lived, Alfred Russel Wallace never became a household name. Many believe the 19th century scientist, who may have even coined the phrase 'origin of species' which became the title of Darwin's earth-shattering theory, could be regarded as the 'forgotten father' of evolution. He also came up with the concept of warning colouration in animals, and the Wallace effect, a hypothesis on how species evolved. Wallace also did extensive fieldwork, first . in the Amazon River basin and then in the Malay Archipelago, where he . identified the Wallace Line that divides the Indonesian archipelago into . two distinct parts. The work of Wallace is now finally set to be celebrated, 100 years after his death, in a series of events at the Natural History Museum in London. A portrait of the scientist is to be unveiled in the museum's Central Hall close to the famous statue of Darwin by comedian and naturalist Bill Bailey tomorrow, and the museum will put an archive of Wallace's correspondence online, as well as displaying some of his most important specimens. The Natural History Museum's Wallace 100 programme was organised to mark the centenary of his death in 1913 and put the biologist back in the spotlight. Both Wallace and Darwin shared authorship of the scientific article that first proposed the theory of natural selection in 1858, a year before Darwin's book On the Origin of Species came out and secured a place in history. Wallace independently came up with the idea of natural selection and founded the science of evolutionary biogeography - the study of the geographical distribution of plants and animals. He made a significant impact in fields as diverse as anthropology and epidemiology, and gathered thousands of previously unknown species in South America and Asia. Overshadowed: Alfred Russel Wallace will finally step out of the shadow of Charles Darwin, left, when a portrait of him will be unveiled at the Natural History Museum in London by comedian and naturalist Bill Bailey, right . Celebration: London's Natural History Museum, pictured, is to celebrate the work of Alfred Russel Wallace 100 years after his death . Natural History Museum curator and Wallace expert Dr George Beccaloni said: 'This anniversary is a great opportunity to raise awareness of Wallace's ground-breaking scientific work, his valuable collections which are still being studied today, and his amazing adventures in South America and South East Asia in search of the process responsible for generating the astonishing diversity of life on Earth. 'Wallace's remarkable accomplishments are not as appreciated today as they were in his own lifetime, and are often overshadowed by Darwin's.' Wallace will also be the subject of a BBC2 series to be screened in the spring and hosted by Bill Bailey, who is patron of the Wallace Fund which is raising money to pay for a life-size sculpture of the scientist. The 'Batocera Wallacei' part of a collection of Alfred Russel Wallace's specimens which has been on display at the Natural History Museum in London previously . Born in 1823, Alfred Russel Wallace was one of the 19th century's most remarkable intellectuals. Not only did he co-discover the process of evolution by natural selection with Charles Darwin in 1858, but he also made very many other significant contributions, not just to biology, but also to subjects as diverse as glaciology, land reform, anthropology, ethnography, epidemiology, and astrobiology. His pioneering work on evolutionary biogeography (the study of how plants and animals are distributed) led to him becoming recognised as that subject’s ‘father’. Beyond this, Wallace is regarded as the pre-eminent collector and field biologist of tropical regions of the 19th century, and his book The Malay Archipelago (which was Joseph Conrad’s favourite bedside reading) is one of the most celebrated travel writings of that century and has never been out of print. In February 1858 Wallace was suffering from an attack of fever in the village of Dodinga on the remote Indonesian island of Halmahera when suddenly the idea of natural selection as the mechanism of evolutionary change occurred to him. As soon as he had sufficient strength he wrote an detailed essay explaining his theory and sent it together with a covering letter to Charles Darwin, who he knew from correspondence was interested in the subject of evolution. He asked Darwin to pass the essay on to lawyer and foremost geologist of his day Charles Lyell if Darwin thought it was sufficiently interesting - probably hoping that Lyell would help to ensure that it was published in a good journal. Lyell (who Wallace had never corresponded with) was one of the most respected scientists of the time and Wallace must have thought that he would be interested in reading his new theory because it explained the 'laws' which Wallace had proposed in his 'Sarawak Law' paper. Darwin had mentioned in a letter to Wallace that Lyell had found Wallace's 1855 paper noteworthy. Unbeknown to Wallace, Darwin had of course discovered natural selection many years earlier. He was therefore horrified when he received Wallace's letter and immediately appealed to his influential friends Lyell and Joseph Hooker for advice on what to do. Lyell and Hooker decided to present Wallace's essay, along with two unpublished excerpts from Darwin's writings on the subject, to a meeting of the Linnean Society of London on 1 July 1858.

A three-year-old girl suffered a fatal brain injury after her head was allegedly slammed against a wall by her mother's boyfriend. 'Bright and bubbly' Lylah Aaron was kicked, slapped and punched in the head by Delroy Catwell, Sheffield Crown Court heard. Catwell is said to have been jealous that the toddler was getting more attention from her mother than he was. Lylah was found to have four broken ribs and the prosecution claim she was assaulted by Catwell several weeks before she died in February. Tragic: Three-year-old Lylah Aaron died from severe brain injuries when she was allegedly beaten by her mother's boyfriend Delroy Catwell . Traces of her blood were found on the carpet close to a crack in the plasterboard wall, which contained Afro-Caribbean hairs, in the main bedroom of her home. While Catwell claims the wall was damaged while he was attempting to kill a spider four months previously, the prosecution say that explanation is 'implausible' and that forensic evidence points to Lylah having had her head smashed off the wall. Catwell, a DJ who lived with Lylah's mother Precious Chibanda in Shiregreen, Sheffield, denies murder. Bryan Cox QC, prosecuting, told the court: 'The couple’s relationship was generally good but sometimes he would complain he felt sidelined and she gave too much to Lylah.' The defendant later told police the girl was full of energy and he 'found it hard to deal with her demands at times.' Emergency services were called to the house by a frantic Miss Chibanda, a nurse at Derby Royal Infirmary, when she found her daughter 'very ill' on February 8. Paramedics discovered Lylah’s body was rigid and attempted resuscitation. She was rushed to hospital on the evening  but doctors could not revive her and her life support machine was switched off. Poignant: Tributes are left outside Lylah Aaron's family home after she died from head injuries earlier this year . Subsequent examinations by medical specialists found both swelling and fresh bleeding around Lylah’s brain. Mr Cox QC said: 'There were numerous bruises over her body, her face, her head and inside and behind her ears. Some of the bruises were small but many were substantial. 'They included substantial bruising to her head, fractures to her ribs and bruising to her arm. 'The injuries indicated she had been subject to a sustained and forceful assault that had occurred within hours of her admission to hospital. 'The couple’s relationship was generally good but sometimes he would complain he felt sidelined and she gave too much to Lylah.' Bryan Cox QC, prosecuting . 'Doctors also found clear evidence of an earlier and quite separate assault, a healing rib fracture and earlier bleeding on the brain. 'Those injuries indicated she had suffered an earlier assault two to five weeks previously.' Catwell had sole care of Lylah on the day she suffered her fatal injuries. Her mother had gone to work and Catwell failed to take Lylah to her nursery where staff described her as 'bright' and a 'confident, bubbly little girl'. He claimed the girl was ill and did not want to go but the prosecution allege he inflicted the fatal injuries before Miss Chibanda returned from work about 4.30pm. Mr Cox alleged: 'The number, type and severity of the injuries sustained by Lylah make it clear she was the victim of a deliberate assault by the defendant.' Lylah’s natural father split with South-African born Miss Chibanda before Lylah was born and Catwell moved in with the mother in her two-bedroom detached home towards the end of 2011. Hunt for clues: A forensics officer enters the Sheffield home of Lylah Aaron. Scientific evidence suggests that her head was banged off a wall in the main bedroom of the house . The mother thought Catwell had taken Lylah to nursery but got a call at work from him saying the child was unwell. She returned home, found Lylah asleep and checked on her three times before she decided to wake her daughter but she was cold and there was no response. Doctors at Sheffield Children’s Hospital found Lylah had bruises to her head and bleeding in her eyes which were fixed and dilated. A pathologist reported that the bruises to Lylah’s head were 'typical of non-accidental injuries' and bruising in and behind the left ear 'suggested impact from a hard object with a straight linear surface.' He went on: 'Other bruises could have been caused by kicks, slaps or punches.' All the bruises had been caused within 24 hours of her death after she had been put to bed the previous evening. Medical experts found scar tissue on the brain indicating a three-week-old injury and the four rib fractures. One of the fractures was about three weeks old while the other three were fresh breaks had been caused by 'squeezing or compression'. Mr Cox said the medics concluded Lylah died from repeated impacts causing fatal bleeding to the brain. The court heard Catwell had also been in sole care of Lylah when the wall was damaged and that the nursery had contacted Miss Chibanda seven months earlier to say Lylah had a bruise on her neck. Catwell told the mother she had banged her head on a sink. When arrested, the defendant said Lylah had been ill for a few days. She was tired and would not eat her breakfast so he put her back in bed and never left the house all day. He told officers: 'I have never hit Lylah. I didn’t cause any injuries whatsoever.' The trial continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Lylah Aaron was 'kicked, slapped and punched in the head' by Delroy Catwell .

The former deputy director of the CIA blasted Edward Snowden during an interview aired Sunday night – calling him a traitor and saying his actions have put Americans at greater risk. Michael Morell, formely the number two spy at the agency, called Mr Snowden’s actions the most serious leak of intelligence in US history – actions that have done far greater harm than good. His comments echo similar remarks made earlier this month by the head of British intelligence agency MI5. He's a traitor: Former CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell blasted Edward Snowden in a 60 Minutes interview aired Sunday night . ‘I do not believe he is a whistle blower,’ Mr Morell told 60 Minutes. ‘I do not believe he is a hero, I believe he has betrayed his country.’ Sharing an opinion held by many U.S. officials, the ex-spook claimed the man revered by many is a reckless traitor who has crippled the States’ intelligence gathering. ‘I think this is the most serious leak – the most serious compromise of classified information in the history of the US intelligence community,’ Mr Morell continued. Saying both the amount and type of information revealed by the spy secret leaker is equally damning, Mr Morell bemoaned the disclosure of the CIA budget. The ‘black book,’ as it is referred to, details the agency’s spending across all activites. He did more harm than good: Mr Morell contends the Guardian's Snowden series put Americans' lives in danger . ‘[Enemies] could focus their counterintelligence efforts on those places where we’re being successful, and not worry as much about those places where we’re not being as successful,’ Mr Morell lamented. When 60 Minutes correspondent John Miller suggested it was like giving a playbook to the other team, the former Presidential intelligence briefer nodded in agreement. If that sentiment sounds familiar, that’s because it is. MI5 chief Andrew Parker earlier this month called the Guardian’s series of collaborations with Mr Snowden a ‘gift’ to terrorists. ‘It causes enormous damage to make public the reach and limits of GCHQ techniques. Such information hands the advantage to the terrorists,’ Mr Parker said in an Oct 9 speech. ‘Unfashionable as it might seem, that is why we must keep secrets secret, and why not doing so causes such harm,' he continued. Mr . Parker claimed in the speech, given at a London think-tank, that there . are several thousand U.K.-based terrorist operatives who have benefitted . from the Snowden exposés. Fury: The spy chief: MI5 director-general Andrew Parker has blasted the Guardian's publication of Britain's espionage capabilities . Even worse, Mr Morell claims, is the possibility that Mr Snowden’s files were compromised as he trotted across the globe from Washington to Hawaii, then Hong Kong to Moscow. ‘We have to assume that any material Mr Snowden had with him when he was in HK, and now in Russia, has been compromised – I think we have to assume that,’ said the former second-in-command. Currently squirreled away in Russia after being granted temporary political asylum, Mr Snowden has rarely been seen in public except to receive an award for ‘Integrity in Intelligence.’ That award couldn’t be more juxtaposed with the way Mr Snowden’s government views him. ‘What Edward Snowden did has put Americans at greater risk because terrorists learn from leaks, they will be more careful,’ said Mr Morell. ‘We will not get the intelligence we would have gotten otherwise.’","Former deputy director Michael Morell recently retired from the CIA .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 13:07 EST, 16 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:22 EST, 16 October 2013 . A Cuban exile and professional hit man assassinated President John F. Kennedy with Lee Harvey Oswald in 1963, an author has claimed. Anthony Summers said evidence shows Herminio Diaz, who was part of the anti-Castro movement that felt betrayed by Kennedy for the Bay of Pigs invasion, was in the U.S. at the time of the killing. Afterwards, Diaz reportedly revealed to friends that he had been part of the murder and after his death in 1966, one moved to Miami and eventually contacted officials to share the story. The . chief counsel of the U.S. House Select Committee on Assassinations, G. Robert Blakey, said . he believed the account and called the new details 'a breakthrough of historical . importance'. Accused: An author has claimed that Heminio Diaz (left), a Cuban exile, was also responsible for the assassination of President John F. Kennedy n 1963. Lee Harvey Oswald (right) was arrested for the killing . The startling claims have been made by Summers in an update to his 1998 book on the killing, 'Not In Your Lifetime' and shared with the National Enquirer. While Diaz's name has been linked to the assassinations before, Summers claims he now has the real evidence - and support from experts - to prove the claims are true. It further fuels beliefs that Kennedy's assassination as he drove in a motorcade through Dallas, Texas was a conspiracy and not carried out solely by Oswald, who was arrested for the murder. Diaz, who had worked for Mafia boss Santo Tafficante Jr. in Cuba and killed a Cuban police officer in the 1940s, arrived in the U.S. a few months before the assassination on November 22, 1963, CIA documents show, the Enquirer reported. Before tragedy: President John F. Kennedy and his wife Jackie Kennedy Onassis smile at the crowds lining their motorcade route in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963 minutes before he was shot . Horror: An image shows Jackie Kennedy leaning over to help her husband just after he was shot . 'Diaz was a professional hit man with a record of political assassinations,' Summers said. 'He was in the country at the right time and was involved in the anti-Castro movement. 'Many people in that movement thought President Kennedy had betrayed them during the CIA-sponsored Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961 and the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, and had a motive to kill him. Frankly, it all adds up.' Summers did not say how Oswald and Diaz would have been acquainted with each other. After the assassination, Diaz was traveling to Cuba for an anti-Castro raid with a friend, Tony Cuesta, who he told about his role in the killing, the Enquirer reported. Diaz died in the raid and Cuesta was hurt after trying to commit suicide to avoid capture - but he was caught and jailed at La Cabana Prison. Claims: Author Anthony Summers said he spoke to another Cuban immigrant who heard that Diaz confessed to the assassination. The new details are an addition to his 1998 book, Not In Your Lifetime . While being treated in the infirmary, he told another anti-Castro inmate, Reinaldo Martinez, about Diaz's confession. After Martinez was released from prison, he went to Miami and eventually contacted G. Robert Blakey, chief counsel of the U.S. House Select Committee on Assassinations, in 2007. Blakey told the National Enquirer that Martinez thought he was going to die so wanted to come clean. 'After speaking with him, I believe he was telling the truth,' he said. 'This is a breakthrough of historical importance.' Summers, who also spoke to Martinez at length, and Blakey said that Martinez had gone to the FBI with his story, but he was told the investigation was closed. In the famous Zapruder film of the assassination, Kennedy can be seen being hit from behind - where Oswald was standing - and then apparently being hit from the front, some experts have said. Blame: Oswald, pictured the day after the assassination, was the only person arrested for the killing. A man who heard Diaz was responsible for the shooting told the FBI - but they said the case was closed . Cyril H. Wecht, a medical examiner who has studied the assassination for decades, said he agrees there was someone else involved. 'Based on the initial backward trajectory of the president's head after being impacted by the gunshot blasts, I believe a shooter operated from the right front of the vehicle behind the picket fence on the grassy knoll,' he said. 'Eyewitness accounts corroborate this.' The Warren Report into the death discounted this and instead only Oswald was arrested for the death. He denied any role in the assassination. Two days after his arrest, he was shot dead by nightclub owner Jack Ruby as he was transferred from police headquarters to jail.","Author Anthony Summers has claimed that Cuban exile shot President John F.

In a victory for affirmative action opponents, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Abigail Fisher in a case that alleged the University of Texas at Austin rejected her application in favor of minority applicants with similar grades and test scores. The court sent the case back to a lower court for another look. The court's 7-1 decision in Fisher v. University of Texas Monday was a blow to advocates of the 35-year-old law that boosts college admissions of African Americans and other minorities. Scroll down for video... Victory: Abigail Fisher, who took her case against affirmative action all the way to the Supreme Court,speaks at a news conference Monday after the high court ruled in her favor 7-1 to send the case back to the lower court . 'I was devastated,' she said to the press four years after her rejection from the selective, highly regarded university. 'I probably would have gotten a better job offer had I gone to U.T.,' she told the New York Times. Another factor fueling Fisher's lawsuit . was that the university has produced diversity by . automatically offering about three-quarters of its spots to graduates in . the top 10 percent of their Texas high schools, under a 1990s state law . signed by then-Gov. George W. Bush. Acting firmly: Fisher maintains she was passed over for minority students who performed as well or not as well as she did in high school by UT Austin admissions . Taking action? Attorney Bert Rein (left), speaks to the media while standing with plaintiff Abigail Fisher, after the U.S. Supreme Court Supreme heard arguments in her discrimination case in October 2012 . The landmark Fisher v. UT Austin case was only one among several groundbreaking cases that SCOTUS has decided this week. Some decisions have been announced, while others are still to come, including the long-awaited DOMA and Prop 8 same-sex marriage cases. TODAY'S DECISIONS . Vance v. Ball State University: The court ruled in favor of Ball State, making it harder for employees to sue employers for harassment because it ruled a person must be able to hire and fire someone to be considered a supervisor in such suits. US v. Kebodeaux: Ruled that sex offenders may still be listed on sex offender registries even if they completed their sentences before the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act came into law. University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar: Decided for the university, ruling that an employee who claims harassment and complains of subsequent punishment must show the punishment would not have occurred if not for the complaint. Mutual Pharmaceutical Co. v. Bartlett: Decided for the pharma company, not the woman whose skin fell off after using their drug, and ruled that federal law trumps state law in cases of the adequacy of drug warning labels. SOME RULINGS TO COME . Windsor v. US: This is the Defense of Marriage Act case. DOMA defines marriage as between one man and one woman at the federal level and opponents believe it's unconstitutional. Hollingsworth v. Perry: This is the case that will decide the constitutionality of California's 2008 voter-passed Proposition 8 that banned same-sex marriage . Shelby County, Alabama v. Holder: Current law lets the federal government monitor voting in areas with a history of discrimination. Opponents seek to strike down that aspect of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. That includes schools where the top level of achievement could be significantly lower than at higher-performing schools. It also includes schools where the student demographics skew toward minorities. Fisher was a good student who played on the soccer team and graduated with a 3.59 grade point average. She graduated 82nd in a class of 674, which put her close to the top 10 percent but not quite close enough, reports Business Insider. The admissions program has been . changed so that now only the top 8 percent gain automatic admission. According to Fisher, minorities who . graduated below her and who participated less in extracurricular . activities at her high school were accepted to the flagship University of Texas system school. Justice Kennedy wrote for the 7 to 1 . majority. He said the New Orleans appeals court that sided with Texas . originally did not scrutinize the case sufficiently enough and in . accordance with the Supreme Court's 2003 upholding of affirmative . action. Justice Elena Kagan stayed out of the . case, presumably because she had some contact with it at an earlier . stage when she worked in the Justice Department. The compromise ruling throws out the . decision by the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, . which upheld the Texas admission plan. More than 8 in 10 African-American . and Latino students who enrolled at the flagship campus in Austin in . 2011 were automatically admitted, according to university statistics. Even among the rest, both sides acknowledge that the use of race is . modest. In all, black and Hispanic students made up more than a quarter of the incoming freshmen class. White . students constituted less than half the entering class when students . with Asian backgrounds and other minorities were added in. Texas argued that race is one of many . factors considered and that whether race played the key role in any . applicant's case was impossible to tell. The . Obama administration, roughly half of the Fortune 100 companies and . large numbers of public and private colleges that feared a broad ruling . against affirmative action backed the Texas program. Among . the benefits of affirmative action, the administration said, is that it . creates a pipeline for a diverse officer corps that it called . 'essential to the military's operational readiness.' Unfair? Fisher speaks to the media after U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in her case in October.

A 17-year-old girl who died when the SUV she was driving ran off the road and slammed into several trees was 13 times over the legal limit, tests have shown. She took the wheel after three teenage boys had driven the car and they are now facing criminal charges, including reckless endangerment. The town of Glastonbury, Connecticut, has been mourning Elisabeth Jane Modlesky, ever since her accident on July 14. Tragic: Elisabeth Jane Modlesky, 17, was killed July 14 when she crashed her SUV into an oak tree . Star: Modlesky was one of the leading point scorers on the Glastonbury High School lacrosse team and was looking forward to her senior year, her coach says. She is seen here with her mother . Horrific: Police say Modlesky lost control of her vehicle and slammed into a series of oak trees . The police investigation into what transpired prior to the crash determined that four juvenile males - who have not been named - and Ms Modlesky were driving in a 2008 Honda pilot, which belonged to the parents of one of Jane Modlesky's friends. Police . said that juvenile No3 was driving the vehicle and dropped off Juvenile No4 at a residence in Glastonbury. Then juvenile No3 continued on and drove to his house and got out. Juvenile No1 then took control of the vehicle and drove to his house where Juvenile No2 got out with him. Glastonbury Police Agent James A. Kennedy said: ‘It was determined that two of the juveniles were well . aware that Jane Modlesky was highly intoxicated. However, despite . knowing this, they allowed her to operate the vehicle.’ He added: 'Jane Modlesky then drove exactly half a mile, before leaving the roadway and striking a tree on Woodhaven Road, which resulted in her death.' A 17-year-old girl was arrested this weekend having thrown two parities while her parents were out of town, police said . Devastating: Modlesky is seen here with her parents as an infant. She was just 17 when she was killed in July . Proud father: Modlesky, seen here with her father, was 'cheerful and bright' and 'any family would have been happy to have her,' says her lacrosse coach . Police have determined that Modlesky was 13 times over the limit when she crashed . Her blood alcohol was found to be 0.27 per cent – 13 times the legal driving limit for someone under 21 - at the time of the crash. In August, a 17-year-old girl was arrested by Glastonbury police for throwing booze-fueled parties. Police . say they handed down the charges in connection with Modlesky's . late-night crash, but have not said whether she was coming home from a . party thrown by the teenage suspect. Police . said they charged the teenage girl - the same age as Modlesky - because . they wanted to 'send a message' to other teens in the town about the . consequences of drinking, the Hartford Courant reports. 'The . bottom line with this arrest is we are hoping to get a message out . there that we are taking this seriously,' Police Chief David Caron said. 'It's . a little disappointing when an incident like this happens and we've . lost a student. But we are going to follow up and we are going to take . this seriously.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 20:47 EST, 20 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:39 EST, 21 September 2013 . When most people think of Theodore Roosevelt, they think of a rough-riding, bear-wrestling frontiersman who tamed the Wild West and who once was shot in the chest at point-blank range but couldn't be bothered with going to the hospital. While many of the legends about the 26th president of the United States are genuine, one of the more iconic pieces of Roosevelt imagery, it turns out, is a fraud. One of the more-famous photos of the leader of the original Rough Riders shows him riding a moose across a body of water. But, as a curator at a Harvard University library has discovered, the image was the product of nothing more than a very basic form of Photoshop. Bull moose? More like bull-crap! Iconic photo of Theodore Roosevelt turns out to be fake . Safari: Just because he didn't ride a moose doesn't mean Teddy Roosevelt wasn't a skilled outdoorsman . Bull Moose: After leaving the presidency, Roosevelt created the Bull Moose Party and ran for president again as the Bull Moose candidate . Heather Cole, curator of the university's Theodore Roosevelt book collection, has discovered that the photo was simply doctored to make Roosevelt appear as though he was riding a bull moose as part of a newspaper's coverage of the 1912 presidential election, in which Roosevelt was running as a candidate from the newly formed Progressive 'Bull Moose' Party. The photo was created by the photography firm Underwood and Underwood and used in a collage titled The Race for the White House.' The collage was published in the New York Tribune on September 8, 1912. Without the back-story of the whole collage, the photo of Roosevelt has been repeatedly taken out of context when viewed by itself as a candid photo of President Roosevelt. But as part of the bigger picture of the collage as a whole, a photographer altering the image to include a moose makes much more sense. Statesman: When he wasn't riding horses, Roosevelt was the first president to fly in a plane and drive a car . The other two men in the original collage were President William Howard Taft riding an elephant and Woodrow Wilson saddled up on the back of a donkey. Taft was running as a Republican, while Wilson was running as a Democrat. The symbolic animals for those parties are an elephant and a donkey, respectively. So, as the founding father of the Bull Moose Party, it only made sense to put Roosevelt on the back of a giant moose. Over the years, as photos emerged of Roosevelt wrangling horses and killing rhinoceroses, it didn't seem too far-fetched that he could woo a moose into giving him a lift across a river. Rough Rider: Roosevelt made a name for himself leading the Rough Riders in the Spanish-American War . Cole theorizes that Underwood used a photo of Roosevelt riding a horse and then carefully taped it over a photo of the moose to make it appear as though he was riding it. Also visible, as Cole points out, is the white line scratched or painted on the photo to approximate a ripple made by Roosevelt's leg in the water.","The original photo was part of a collage during the 1912 presidential campaign .

Raffaele Sollecito, the former boyfriend of Amanda Knox, has told a court spending time in prison was a 'nightmare' and begged jurors to give him his life back. Sollecito broke down at the end of the court appearance in Florence, Italy, today as he denied that he and Knox murdered Meredith Kercher in an emotional 15-minute speech. Today expert testimony during the trial says tests on the presumed murder weapon show a new DNA trace belongs to Knox, not victim Miss Kercher. Scroll down for video . Retrial: Raffaele Sollecito (right) sit in the courtroomin Florence, Italy, for the hearing of the retrial for the murder of Meredith Kercher . The result bolsters the defense, which claims the knife was not the weapon used to kill British student Meredith Kercher. Another piece of DNA on the knife blade initially attributed to Miss Kercher was disputed on appeal. Knox defense lawyer Carlo dalla Vedova said the evidence shows the knife was a simple kitchen knife used by Knox. Earlier evidence showed her DNA on the handle. The expert testified today that the minute new trace showed 'considerable affinity' with Knox's DNA, while not matching those of Miss Kercher, Knox's co-defendant or an Ivorian man convicted in the 2007 murder. Sollecito said he had been portrayed as a . 'ruthless assassin' and said he had suffered since he and American . student Knox were arrested after Miss Kercher’s body was found in the . cottage she shared with Knox in Perugia. 'I have been described as a ruthless killer but I am nothing of the sort,"" said Mr Sollecito, wearing khaki trousers and a brown pullover, the Telegraph reports. The accusations against them were 'absurd', he said during his first appearance at the appeals trial. Sollecito, 29, said the four years he spent in prison after being convicted of murder and sexual assault was something he would not wish 'on anyone in the world'. The IT graduate and Knox drew attention for their behaviour after the Leed's University student's death in November 2007. Sollecito said Knox was his first love and he had met her at a classical music contest ten days before Miss Kercher, from Coulsdon, Surrey, was murdered. 'In Perugia I dedicated myself to my studies, which were very tough, but in the meantime I met Amanda. She was my first true love – I started rather late,' Mr Sollecito told the judge and jury. He admitted smoking marijuana occasionally but said he had grown up in a respectable family in Bari, Southern Italy and had never been in trouble with the law before he was arrested in connection with the murder of the 21-year-old student.

Sollecito said his life was 'quiet and normal life' and neither he or Knox realised how serious the situation they were in was after Miss Kercher's death. They had been living in a 'little fairy tale', he told the court. 'I didn’t take things seriously enough at the start,' said Sollecito, who flew back to Italy for the hearing from the Dominican Republic in the Caribbean, where he was on holiday. Prosecutors allege that Mr Sollecito and Miss Knox, together with Rudy Guede, a small-time drug dealer in Perugia, attacked Miss Kercher to a frenzied assault in her bedroom on the night of Nov 1 during a group sex game. Sollecito said he did not know Guede, who is serving 16 years in jail after being convicted, and that he barely knew Miss Kercher. 'I never knew Guede. We had two very different lives,' he added. He and Knox spent four years in prison until they were aquitted by an appeals court in 2011. 'I was thrown into a maximum security prison. I wouldn’t wish on anyone in the world the experience that I had to go through,' he said. 'It was a nightmare that went beyond any imagination.'

James, a former television executive, surpassed regulars on the list, including James Patterson, Danielle Steel and Stephen King, with estimated earnings of $95 million in the year to June 2013, thanks to the titillating trilogy. 'The e-book format was a key factor, giving readers an easy way to purchase sex-filled sequels - and a discreet way to read them in public,' according to Forbes.com.

Last week a study of Fifty Shades of Grey, the best-selling tale of erotic romance, said the novel perpetuates the problem of violence against women, according to a new study. Reporting in the Journal of Women's Health, Dr Amy Bonomi concluded that emotional and sexual abuse is pervasive in the novel, with the main female character, Anastasia, suffering harm as a result. About 25 per cent of women are victims of violence by intimate partners. ‘This book is perpetuating dangerous abuse standards and yet it's being cast as this romantic, erotic book for women,’ said Dr Bonomi, lead author of the study. ‘The erotic content could have been accomplished without the theme of abuse.’ The book is a best-seller in the US and the UK and in the last 12 months alone has netted author E L James a staggering £61.4million ($94.9million). The strong sales have propelled the London-based author into the pole position on Forbes' list of successful writers - leapfrogging rival James Patterson who trailed by £2.5million ($3.9million). Fifty Shades of Grey, the best-selling tale of erotic romance, perpetuates the problem of violence against women, according to a new study . The researchers, at Ohio State University, conducted a systematic analysis of the novel to clarify patterns consistent with Centres for Disease Control and Prevention definitions of intimate partner violence, and associated reactions known to occur in abused women. Anastasia suffers reactions consistent with those of abused women. She feels a constant sense of threat and loss of self-identity, changes her behaviours to keep peace in the relationship, and becomes disempowered and entrapped in the relationship. The news comes after it was revealed that since the release of Fifty Shades of Grey fire fighters have been called to more and more people who are handcuffed to their beds. London Fire Brigade alone said it had been called to 79 such incidents and urged people to 'always keep the keys handy'. Third officer Dave Brown, said: 'Some . of the incidents our fire fighters are called out to could be prevented . with a little common sense. 'I . don't know whether it's the Fifty Shades effect, but the number of . incidents involving items like handcuffs seems to have gone up.

Dr Amy Bonomi concluded that emotional and sexual abuse is pervasive in the novel, with the main female character, Anastasia, suffering harm as a result . Written by E.L.

Most women spend months hunting for the perfect wedding dress but for one romantic bride, the gown of her dreams was to be found a little closer to home. Lucy Popovic, 31, was married wearing a stunning vintage dress that had already been up the aisle twice before - on her mother and grandmother. First used by her grandmother Mel in 1950, the dress had its second outing in 1974 when Mel's daughter Peggy wore it for her big day before being used for a third time by Lucy. Romantic: Lucy in the vintage dress on her wedding day, flanked by her husband Mark and her grandparents . Beautiful: Lucy posing for a picture after the nuptials (left) and being zipped into the dress by her mother (right) The off-white dress was bought for six guineas - the equivalent of around £172 today - for grandmother Mel's marriage to Ian Calder in London's South Kensington. The dress was then worn by Mel’s daughter Penny in 1974 when she married Harry Dafforn at Hampton Court in Surrey. Lucy, from Solva in Pembrokeshire, decided to continue the tradition and wore the dress when she married her Australian husband Mark Popovic, 35. Lucy, who works in construction, revealed: 'It was a quite nerve racking time because we only got back to .

She added: 'I felt really lucky to be able to wear the same dress that both my mum and grandma had worn. 'The dress you get married in holds such special memories and it was really lovely to wear a dress with so much family history. 'I had always thought the dress was beautiful and hoped that one day I would get to wear it.' Lucy, whose wedding date coincided with her grandparents 62nd wedding anniversary, added: .

Before she could wear the dress, it had to be cleaned with a homemade mixture of aspirin and white vinegar. 'I found the dress looking rather grubby,' said Lucy's mother Penny, 59. 'I researched stain removal for silk on the internet, and after several crushed aspirin and white vinegar stain removals, it looked perfect on Lucy.'","Lucy Popovic, 31, was the third member of her family to wear the dress .

Smokers are being encouraged to attend AA-style meetings on the high street in a bid to help them quit, it has emerged. Boots has set up free ‘Smoke Less’ clinics at more than 500 stores nationwide to encourage their customers to kick the habit. The sessions are being run by pharmacists or healthcare assistants who have undergone training on the NHS’s stop smoking programme and also had some ‘behavioural smoking’ education to help them fully understand why people smoke and find it hard to give up cigarettes. Boots has set up free 'Smoke Less' clinics at more than 500 stores nationwide to encourage their customers to kick the habit . After an initial consultation, where the pharmacist builds up a smoking profile of the individual - for example, why they want to give up, how many cigarettes they smoke and when, a programme of nicotine replacement products, such as patches or gum, are prescribed at discounted prices. The smoker is then urged to attend their first AA-style support group, alongside other addicts or on their own, 10 days later and encouraged to regularly attend weekly or fortnightly meetings to help them to cut down and eventually quit. Incentives being offered to attend the clinics also include 100 extra reward points on their Boots Advantage loyalty card for each time they attend. The sessions have been prompted following a change in guidelines from the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, which for the first time in June advised health professionals to talk about the benefits of ‘harm reduction’ by cutting down on cigarettes, rather than simply concentrating on forcing people to quit completely. Previously, smokers may be forced to wait up to six months should they slip up and admit to having a cigarette before being accepted on a new NHS programme, but the ‘smoke less’ sessions recognise that relapses may occur and do not penalise people for falling off the wagon. If a customer is found to be eligible for a stop smoking programme on the NHS they will still be referred, but will also get help from the Boots programme, allowing the pair to run alongside each other. Lily Nichols, 35, joined one of the ‘Smoke Less’ clinics at her local High Holborn branch of Boots, central London, last month. ‘I started smoking at the age of 16 and didn’t worry about my health until I was in my early 30s,’ she said. ‘I tried the NHS program but couldn’t cut down completely in the shorter time frame, due to social situations, where the temptation was too great. After an initial consultation a programme of nicotine replacement products, such as patches or gum, are prescribed at discounted prices . ‘I wanted to start a family and knew I wasn’t the sort of person who can cut cigarettes out completely but would prefer to gradually cut down first. I’ve been to the Boots clinic three times now, and the advice and help they give you is extremely supportive. ‘I’ve not smoked for two weeks thanks to their encouragement. There was one occasion where I did slip up in the first week and they didn’t make me feel like a failure. ‘I know it’s going to be a long battle, but for the first time I actually feel that it’s achievable.’ Edward Argyle, healthcare buying manager for Boots, said the idea behind the clinics was to provide as much support as possible for smokers once they make the decision to quit or cut down. ‘Following months of customer research we identified the need for a different type of behavioural service for people who wanted to quit or cut down on their smoking, but who recognised that they needed help and support in doing so,’ he said. ‘The ‘Smoke Less’ clinics are a unique service, in the mould of Weightwatchers for slimmers and AA for alcoholics, for people who maybe find it difficult to cut cigarettes out of their lives completely straight away. ‘With the help and encouragement of our pharmacists and other smokers we hope they will be able to reduce the amount they smoke, with a view to coming off them altogether in the long run. ‘We want to help those who cut down from 20 a day to 10, or who want to stop smoking in the week, but carry on at the weekend, as well as those determined to quit completely. ‘The service is also different because we recognise relapses can and will occur and there’s no penalty for this. Instead the clinics will provide support for those who need to get back on track. It’s all about rewarding the effort and not labelling the odd slip up as failure.’ If it proves successful the programme will be run out to more than 1,000 stores nationwide in January.","Smoke Less clinics will encourage customers to kick the habit .

British mother Paula Reynolds has been ordered to return to Italy with her son by a Family Division judge . After her ex-boyfriend allegedly held a knife to her throat, British mother Paula Reynolds fled Italy and came back to the UK with her young son. Now, however, a Family Division judge has ruled she must return. And the 37-year-old has been told she could be arrested and her three-year-old son placed in a state-run children’s home when she arrives in Italy next week. Miss Reynolds fled to her mother’s home in Bala, North Wales, after claiming she had suffered a catalogue of physical abuse at the hands of her Italian former partner – the father of her child. But last week, the Family Division of the High Court ruled she must return her son after the Italian authorities applied using controversial child abduction laws under the Hague Convention. Miss Reynolds said: ‘It’s terrifying as my son could very well be taken away from me while I’m arrested as soon as we land. ‘I left Italy quickly as I needed to be with my family and was terrified that my son would be taken away from me while over there. ‘I believe I’m going to be trapped over in Italy by their courts which will definitely make me stay because I’m a foreigner. I think they won’t even let me visit my family here any more, fearing I’m going to abduct my son.’ Miss Reynolds’ local MP in North Wales, Elfyn Llwyd, said he was ‘desperately worried’ about her case and would be raising it with Nick Clegg at tomorrow’s Deputy Prime Minister’s Questions. He said: ‘For a child to be handed over to his father while he has domestic violence allegations hanging over him or being placed in an institution is totally unnecessary and potentially very damaging to both the child and mother.’ Miss Reynolds moved to Italy from London to teach English in 2002. The former Manchester University post-graduate met the father of her child, a 40-year-old stonemason, in the Alpine town of Trento in 2009. The Family Division of the High Court ruled she must return her son after the Italian authorities applied using controversial child abduction laws under the Hague Convention . Local MP in North Wales, Elfyn Llwyd, said he was 'desperately worried' about the case and would be raising it with Nick Clegg . A year later their son, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was born and they applied for dual nationality, meaning he  has British and Italian passports. But Miss Reynolds claims the relationship turned sour when her boyfriend strangled and punched her during an argument in their apartment in 2011. She says that she made a complaint to the police and a civil court banned him from having any contact with her and his son for four months. An Italian youth custody court later granted him a one-hour supervised visiting order for his son once a week. Miss Reynolds says she had to go to hospital after he became angry at her when he turned up at their apartment and his son did not want to see him. She claims that he punched her in the face and held a knife to her throat while threatening her last year. Following the allegations, Miss Reynolds applied to an Italian judge to return to her mother’s home. However, she flew back to the UK with her son in September after claiming her ex-boyfriend had assaulted her again. British police confiscated their passports last month. And following a hearing last week, a High Court judge ruled they should both return to Italy on Monday. Miss Reynolds added: ‘My son has settled in Wales and is attending nursery here. He has his grandparents, my brother and his children to play with and has been doing really well. ‘I want to settle in the UK with him and have my family-support network, but I fear I cannot because of the Italian courts.’ Her former boyfriend denies attacking her, but it is believed he will face assault charges at an Italian criminal court hearing due to take place later this month.","Paula Reynolds, 37, ordered back to Italy by Family Division judge .

She was described as a warm and caring young woman, with a love for children, a good Christian upbringing and plenty of friends. But a judge has ordered a sentence of 25 years to life in prison for Courtney Kathleen Addington, the 25-year-old who hid her pregnancy from those around her, stuffed her newborn baby in a garbage and left it under her bed until it died. Sacramento County Superior Court Judge Sharon A. Lueras delivered a powerful and emotional speech when handing down her sentence after a 12-person jury found Addington guilty of first-degree murder. Addington secretly gave birth in the bedroom of her family home in Rosemont, California, earlier this year, hiding her pregnancy from those around her by telling them she had been diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome. The night before the birth she had done internet searches on signs of labor and water breakage. Then on the morning January 25, Addington's father found her bleeding profusely. Courtney Kathleen Addington, 25, said in her defense that she did not know she was pregnant and believed that the birth was a 'bowel movement', despite police discovering she had done internet searches on her phone about signs of labor and water breakage . Frail: Courtney Addington was motionless when her sentence was handed down in court. She was arrested about 8.45pm on January 25. She gave birth that morning in secret in her bedroom . Scene: Police searched Courtney Addington's home in Rosemont, Sacramento City, on the day of the birth following information reported by hospital staff. They found the body of her baby daughter in bag under the bed . She told him and emergency room personnel it was the result of a bowel movement. But staff at Mercy General Hospital determined she had recently given birth. The matter was reported to police, who searched Addington's house that night. Under the bed they found a white garbage with the lifeless body of a newborn inside, the umbilical chord and placenta still attached. In another bag they found some bloody towels. She had given birth to the seven-pound, eight-ounce girl who was later given the name Hayden Elaine Addington Minton. 'I have to stand here for Baby Hayden and let her know her life mattered, and her mother must (be held accountable) for ending her life in a cruel and callous way,' Judge Lueras told the court, according to the Sacramento Bee. 'I see this beautiful young woman, who by all accounts is a caring young woman. 'You don’t look like your typical defendant, sitting there. The thought of baby Hayden Elaine gasping for air, the judge said after pausing briefly to compose herself, is 'unconscionable and it’s haunting'. 'It was a live girl. She was 7 pounds,' Judge Lueras said. 'You put her in a plastic bag ... and you left that baby to die.' Courtney Addington (riight), pictured here with a friend, managed to hide her pregnancy by telling family and friends her swollen stomach was irritable bowel syndrome . Good Christian upbringing: Courtney Addington maintains she did not know she was pregnant . 'Heinous crime': Courtney Addington was found guilty of first-degree murder by a 12 person jury . Lueras said she wished she could put Addington on probation and recommend counseling. But her 'horrible choice' merited something far more severe – the maximum possible prison term of 25 years to life. The sentence came down in front of a packed, emotional courtroom audience. On one side sat Addington’s parents, friends and family, who maintained the young woman’s innocence in tearful testimonies before Lueras. 'I love her dearly, and this is so wrong,' her father, Darren Addington, said. 'It’ll be found out in the end.' On the other of the aisle sat the baby’s father, John Minton, and his family and friends. Several members of the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department sat among them. Minton said he was not there to ask for a harsh penalty or leniency for his former girlfriend, who he said betrayed his trust. 'I ask only that we remember what brought us to where we are, and we remember my daughter Hayden Elaine,' he said, before returning to his seat and melting into quiet sobs. Minton posted on Facebook after the sentencing, thanking people for their supported and apologizing for his distant behavior. 'I wanted to say, that I am sorry to all of you who i have kept at arm's length over the course of this last year,' he wrote online. 'It has been a trying one, and the pain is not over for me. But the reason that i kept you all away from me these many months is linked below. I was unable to talk about it, but will answer any questions you have now. It's over. Hayden is resting in peace now.' The father: John Minton, Courtney Addington's ex-boyfriend and the father of baby Hayden, went on Facebook after the sentencing apologizing to friends for his distant behavior, saying he was not allowed to discuss the case but can now 'answer any questions' In representing Addington during the trial, attorney Jesse Ortiz said the woman did not know she was pregnant, lost consciousness because of heavy bleeding during the birth and bagged up the body believing it was the final remnants of her irritable bowel syndrome. On Friday, he continued his defense by filing a motion for a new trial, arguing that deputies illegally searched Addington’s home and that disturbing photos of the dead baby emotionally impacted jurors and hurt his client’s chances for a fair trial. When Lueras denied the motion and moved on to sentencing, Ortiz continued to stand by Addington. 'Ms. Addington is the good person that her family have described,' he said. 'I don’t think it is possible we’ll know specifically what happened on that day, but Ms. Addington didn’t do anything to harm that baby.' Lueras was not swayed. She lamented the difficult sentence she was about to impose, then handed it down and unceremoniously ended the hearing. A bailiff cleared the courtroom as Addington sat there still.","Courtney Kathleen Addington, 25, has received 25 years to life in prison for the first-degree murder of her baby daughter, Hayden .

The £35billion the Government estimates it loses to tax avoidance and fraud is the ‘tip of the iceberg’, MPs said yesterday. Edward Troup, tax commissioner at HM Revenue and Customs, told the Public Accounts Committee they had no projections for how much would be collected if the revenues of major companies that have faced accusations of tax avoidance were included. The ‘tax gap’ of £35bn owed to the Treasury through evasion, avoidance and fraud was revealed this month. Bosses from HMRC, including Jim Harra (centre) and Edward Troup (right), were yesterday questioned by the public accounts committee over corporation tax . However Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons spending watchdog, said it does not include the millions of tax which some argue firms like Starbucks, Google and Amazon should pay in the UK. Grilling senior HMRC officials in Parliament  yesterday, she said: ‘It does not include a lot of what ordinary punters in the street think you should be collecting, particularly in regard to the large corporations. ‘The tax gap is really the tip of the iceberg in the gap between the money that you collect and the money if everyone paid their fair share,’ the public accounts committee chairman said. Ms Hodge named Google, Facebook, Amazon and Starbucks as companies whose tax affairs had sparked public anger and doubts about whether they were paying their fair share in Britain. She said:  ‘It looks to me that you should be litigating. Why have you not chosen to litigate and test your powers? ‘Why have you not litigated against one single internet company?’ She added: ‘Make a few cases, a few show cases. It’s so bloody obvious.’ Margaret Hodge (left), chairwoman of the committee, said it was 'bloody obvious' that HMRC should mount legal test cases against multi-national companies . Labour MP Austin Mitchell said HMRC ‘hounds’ individuals and small firms over small tax bills but takes a ‘supine attitude’ to global firms. However, Jim Harra, Director of General Business Tax, repeatedly refused to comment on individual cases. He would only say: ‘What we have to look for is: is there evidence that the offshore operation does nothing more than rubberstamp.’ Edward Troup, Tax Assurance Commissioner, added: ‘We make sure we collect the tax due under the law.’ Barney Jones, who worked for Google from 2002 until 2006, contacted the PAC earlier this year with claims Google has a system in place which diverts British profits through Ireland to the Bermuda tax haven and accused the company of 'cheating' the British taxpayer. Jim Harra (centre) refused to comment on individual cases while Edward Troup (right) said that 'collect the tax due under the law' Google assert that all its sales are made in low-tax Ireland, rather than the UK, where corporation tax is just 12.5 per cent compared to 23 per cent in Britain. Ms Hodge said his details had been passed to HMRC, who had spoken to Mr Jones but no action had been taken. She demanded to be given a ‘back of the envelope’ figure for how much more tax would be raised if global firms were challenged, but the inspectors said it was not possible. When HMRC had been challenged by MPs about the tax gap before they described it as a ‘health check’ on their performance. Ms Hodge added: ‘It has now gone up. Does that mean HMRC is actually chronically, institutionally incapable of really collecting tax in the way that it should? ‘You say you are doing better and better and if you look at the money it is 0.2 per cent more. ‘In real terms you got less in tax in 2011-12 than you did in 2010-11. It should have gone up quite a lot.’ In January David Cameron told the Davos summit in Switzerland: ‘Businesses who think they can carry on dodging that fair share, or that they can keep on selling to the UK and setting up ever more complex tax arrangements abroad to squeeze their tax bills right down, well they need to wake up and smell the coffee, because the public who buy from them have had enough.’ Ms Hodge said HMRC had failed to act on the Prime Minister’s words.","HMRC bosses accused of being 'chronically incapable' of collecting all tax .

A business promising to bring ‘snuggles’ to the people of Madison, Wisconsin, has shut less than a month after opening, citing ‘harassment’ from city officials who had publicly expressed concerns that it was really just a front for prostitution. The Snuggle House, which offered hugging, cuddling and spooning with professional snugglers for $60 an hour, attracted nationwide attention back in October when it was initially due to open. In the end the business only opened on November 15 after weeks of delays because of inspections by city officials who were concerned that the second-floor business could be a front for prostitution. These professional snugglers are out of work after The Snuggle House in Madison, Wisconsin, shut after being open less than a month . Assistant city attorney Jennifer Zilavy , said her first thought when she heard about the Snuggle House was ‘OK, this is going to be a place of prostitution.’ She said owner Matthew Hurtado initially . had no business plan, no business insurance, no training protocols and . no answers when she asked him what he would do if a snuggler was . sexually assaulted. Snugglers contend that touching helps relieve stress, but before it had even opened Madison police had talked openly about conducting a sting operation and city attorneys were drafting a new ordinance to regulate snuggling. 'There's no way that (sexual assault) will not happen,' said Zilavy. 'No offense to men, but I don't know any man who wants to just snuggle.' Snuggle House owner Matthew Hurtado was accused by local officials of having no business plan, no business insurance, no training protocols and no answers when asked him what he would do if a snuggler was sexually assaulted . On Friday the business posted a message on its Facebook page that it had closed for good. ‘The Snuggle House is Officially Closed - for good. For those people who supported us, thank you. Snuggle on!’ the post read. No specific reason was given, but on Facebook The Snuggle House posted: 'The push back and harassment is not worth it, honestly.' The closing announcement drew scores of comments on The Snuggle House’s Facebook page, most of them sympathetic. Some said they were sad to see the business close so soon; a few said they had been hoping to try the service. Alderman Mike Verveer, who represents the area, said he received quite a few concerned questions from locals residents and businesspeople before the business opened, but no complaints since then. The Snuggle House had opened in downtown Madison, Wisconsin, last month, but announced on Friday that it has closed for good. He said he was surprised to hear that The Snuggle House had closed so soon and so abruptly. 'My guess would probably be that they just didn’t have the business that they anticipated,' he told the Wisconsin State Journal. The Facebook page for the business offers . The Snuggle House’s furniture to local church organizations 'for people . who are in need,' and promises refunds for unused gift certificates. This type of business has been successful in the likes of New York, Colorado, and California. But Wisconsin's ultra-liberal capital city seemed to have deeper concerns than others where similar businesses have set up shop as cuddling has grown into a cottage industry over the past decade. The concept was that clients would be able to book in for an hour of hugs and cuddles for $60 . The Snuggle House claimed it was a legitimate business and its advertising materials included a disclaimer warning that there would be no nudity or sex . Police in Rochester, N.Y., said they've had no complaints about The Snuggery, which offers overnight cuddle sessions. Be The Love You Are in Boulder, Colo., offers cuddles with ‘Snuggle Stars.’ Cuddle Therapy in San Francisco offers packages that ‘focus directly with your current needs around connection, intimacy and touch,’ according to its website. The nonprofit organization Cuddle Party has trained about 100 people across five continents to run group snuggle sessions, said Len Daley, a psychologist who serves as executive director at Cuddle Party headquarters in Montgomery, Ala. Betty Martin, a Seattle-based sex educator who facilities cuddle parties in that city, said she's never had problems with government officials or police. Cuddle Party participants must keep their clothes on and go through a pre-session workshop on how to say ‘no,’ she said. ‘People think if there's touch happening there must be sex happening.

A council worker who tripped over a mop has been awarded thousands of pounds in damages. The 61-year-old cleaner, employed by Rotherham Council, South Yorkshire, was paid £9,128 after stumbling over a mop handle, falling and pulling a groin muscle. Figures released under the Freedom of Information Act have revealed that since 2007 the same council has paid out a whopping £1million in compensation to other workers for minor slips, trips and falls. A teacher, carer, administrative assistant and a weed sprayer received £26,867 between them after falling off chairs. A 53-year-old town hall admin assistant tripped over a 'protruding' dining table leg in 2010 and was handed £14,452. The same year, a labourer was given £10,450 after he was working in the garden of a council house and fell into a hidden pond. A 38-year-old woman housing assistant sued the council and won £16,500 in 2008 after falling because of a pothole in the work car park. A watersports instructor, 25, was given £14,000 compensation after he slipped in a gap in a jetty walkway at a country park. Claims by council employees have cost ratepayers in the town an average of £193,558 a year over the last five years. Robert Oxley of the Taxpayers’ Alliance said: ‘Rotherham Council must cut down on the number and cost of avoidable accidents. ‘The bill to taxpayers for compensation is unacceptably high . While some staff might have legitimate claims because of negligence, there is a worrying rise in compensation culture across local government offices. ‘Taxpayers should not be footing the bill for cases where a bit of common sense would have avoided an accident.' A number of workmen claimed almost £200,000 between them for health problems from using vibrating machinery (file photo) In other claims two home carers, aged . 35 and 65, claimed £9,800 between them after being injured while moving a . patient in bed in October 2008. Four . months later the council had to pay a further £33,740 to another home . carer, aged 44, who developed a back problem from lifting clients. A dozen road workers successfully claimed £184,183 between them for health problems from using vibrating machinery. Claims for hearing problems from working in noisy situations averaged one claim a year totalling £25,155. Deputy leader of the council Jahangir . Akhtar said: ‘From time to time things do go wrong and our staff may . incur a financial loss or suffer a personal injury. Each case is taken . on merit and, in being fair to our employees, we will always accept . responsibility and compensate people in situations where it is proven we . are legally liable to do so. ‘The . council prides itself on its risk assessment and health and safety . policies and continues to invest in this area to maintain our good . record and ensure the welfare and safety or our employees. Rotherham Council has paid out £1million in compensation since 2007 . ‘Examples of work being done include robust training processes for staff and raising awareness of the potential risks in the workplace. ‘Our efforts have resulted in year on year decreases in the number of individually reported incidents in the four years between 2007 and 2010, which has also ensured that the annual sums paid out have decreased significantly.’ The largest single payment was £212,211 to the family of road worker Gordon Duffield, 51, who was crushed to death by a tipper wagon in May 2007. Rotherham Council are not the only ones to use taxpayers' money to pay out large amounts of compensation, however. In April this year, a failed asylum seeker was awarded £750million after he lodged a claim that said his human rights had been abused after he was not allowed to have sex with his girlfriend. It was then revealed that a mistake had been made and a judge struck out his claim. Last year, £18,750 compensation was paid out by Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow, Essex, to a person hit by a bed pushed by a porter. Salford Royal NHS Trust handed £10,860 to a worker injured by slipping over in the shower. And, Rotherham NHS Trust gave £43,500 to a cleaner who suffered breathing problems from toilet cleaner.

These are the images that define credit crunch Britain - or so says a photographer who travelled 16,000 miles visiting towns and cities across the country to see how one of the biggest fiscal meltdowns in living memory affected the average person on the street. Snapper Si Barber embarked on an investigative project to document the real people of the UK and compiled them in a new book which takes its title from David Cameron's much maligned policy idea, 'The Big Society' The photographer began his journey after the collapse of Northern Rock and the start of the financial crisis in 2007. Over the next five years Barber took pictures of Morris Dancers behind safety signs, tattooed EDL activists and lines of trolleys outside closed down shops.

Religious message: In Salford, the face of Hollywood actress Claudia Schiffer, appearing in an advert for luxury cosmetics brand L'Oreal, was obscured by a painting of a hijab . Speaking at the end of his journey, Barber said: 'I started at the same time David Cameron launched his Big Society project, as a polemic. 'I have spent the past few years zipping around the country, looking for things to picture. The results as shocking as they are revealing. Barber’s collection displays a mixture of endearing photographs and more startling ones of religious graffiti and home made drug tools' funerals. Si said: 'The picture of the make shift crack pipe, made out of a Coke can, was taken in leafy Cambridge, a five minute walk from King’s college. It really is surprising what it going on. 'At times it was quite depressing. And there were lots of surprises. It was almost as if I was the one going around blind.

David Cameron launched his Big Society in 2010 as a scheme to empower communities, something he said he was 'great passion.' The Prime Minister wanted dormant bank accounts to be used to help fund post offices, libraries and other community facilities, which would be organised and run by local people. But while Cameron's idea has been brushed under the carpet in recent years, Barber has quietly been photographing the state of the country. He said: 'The Big Society pictures not the movers or the shakers, but those surviving the will of the powerful. The shop workers made to dance for their employers each morning. 'The prostitutes stumbling around the . darkened streets of Bradford looking for punters. The skivers and the . dead squaddies, the lucky and the losers.'

A rare copy of the first ever newspaper printed in Britain is to be auctioned nearly 350 years after it came off the press. The Oxford Gazette was published on November 7, 1665, at a time when London was in the grip of the devastating bubonic plague. It was the first newspaper in the world to be printed in English. Read all about it: This is a copy of the first ever newspaper printed in Britain published on November 7, 1665 . The two-page first edition contained an eclectic mix of news including military and naval engagements, debates in the House of Commons and overseas dispatches. Its front page story was about the Reverend Dr Walter Blandford's election as the Lord Bishop of Oxon. There was also the news of a group of MPs' possible impeachment for treason, and the edition ends with a story noting 1,050 people had died from the plague. The Oxford Gazette was so named . because at the time Charles II had removed his court to the university . city from London, which was being ravaged by the plague. The Gazette was published by journalist Henry Muddiman, and its first publication is noted by Samuel Pepys in his diary. Charles returned to London as the plague dissipated, taking the Gazette with him. It was renamed the London Gazette and the first issue under the new name was published on February 5, 1666. 'Published by Authority': The Oxford Gazette later became The London Gazette, first published on 5 February 1666, and included this edition dated August 24, 1668. The publication is still published to this day as the official organ of Government in which all official notices are printed. The paper is considered the Holy Grail among collectors and is tipped to fetch £15,000 when it goes under the hammer at Mullock's, in Ludlow, Shropshire. It was consigned by a private UK collector. Richard Westwood-Brookes, auctioneer, said: 'This is an incredibly rare example of the very first newspaper ever published. 'It is unclear how many were printed and how many remain, but in private hands there are very few indeed, and you can probably count them on the fingers of one hand. 'It is many years since the last one was sold. 'It is printed on foolscap paper and is in good condition considering its age. Originally this paper was posted to it readers. 'The London Gazette is still published today and records things such as bankruptcies and decorations for servicemen.' The newspaper will be sold at Mullock's on November 5. The world's first newspaper printed in English was published on November 7, 1665. It was the first of the official journals of record of the British government in which certain statutory notices are required to be published. Charles II, pictured right, and the Royal Court had moved to Oxford to escape the Great Plague of London, and courtiers were unwilling to touch, let alone read, London newspapers for fear of contagion. The Gazette was 'Published by Authority' by Henry Muddiman, and its first publication is noted by Samuel Pepys in his diary. The King returned to London as the plague dissipated, and the Gazette moved too, with the first issue of The London Gazette (labelled No. 24) being published on 5 February 1666. During the 17th Century, it was believed that national efficiency depended on the intelligence received by the Crown and that the reckless publishing of news might endanger it. An embargo on the printing of news other than reports of events abroad, natural disasters, royal declarations and sensational crime continued until 1640. This had the effect of delaying the development of the press in the UK. Censorship was introduced in 1643, followed by licensing of news publications. The London Gazette had incomparable sources of information from overseas; in peace time, its 'foreign correspondents' were the British embassies abroad; in time of war the British generals themselves. The first news of Wellington’s victory at Waterloo was carried in the Gazette, and when the newly founded Times stopped its presses to carry the news of this famous battle, it was the despatch which had been published as a Gazette Extraordinary which was reprinted in full.

The researchers at Cornell attempted to teach their knife-happy robot by gentle guiding its arms into the correct position (shown in green) and highlighting incorrect positions (shown in red) By gently guiding its arms, the robot eventually learns that stabbing is wrong and is taught how to handle the knife correctly.

Today robots are reaching new levels of intelligence by being able to process information faster than ever before.

This means that through a process of trial and error and gentle nudging, the robot could learn exactly what it had to do. As the robot executes its movements, researchers  intervene, manually guiding the arms to fine-tune the trajectory. The learning algorithm the researchers provided allows the robot to learn incrementally, refining its trajectory a little more each time. But bizarrely, tasks that most humans find easy, such as balancing a plate full of food or moving a glass of water, are still difficult for robots to learn. The researchers at Cornell attempted to teach their knife-happy robot using something called a ‘coactive learning technique’. This means that through a process of trial and error and gentle nudging, the robot could learn exactly what it had to do. Baxter’s arms have two elbows and a rotating wrist, so it’s not always obvious to a human operator how best to move the arms. To deal with this, the robot displays three possible trajectories on a touch screen where the operator can select the one that looks best. As the robot executes its movements, researchers can intervene, manually guiding the arms to fine-tune the trajectory. The learning algorithm the researchers provided allows the robot to learn incrementally, refining its trajectory a little more each time. Cornell University engineers have taught a robot to work in a mock-supermarket checkout line, modifying a Baxter robot from Rethink Robotics in Boston to 'coactively learn' ‘This research allows the robot to plan its motions appropriately in new circumstances,’ said Cornell University’s Professor Ashutosh Siena told MailOnline. ‘One of the challenges was incorporating user's feedback, which was not correct all the time, and developing a learning algorithm that can learn despite such weak user feedback. ‘Our new algorithm allows learning from intuitive and easy feedback given by non-expert users.

Also, since eggs are fragile, the robot is taught that they shouldn’t be lifted far above the counter. The researchers claim that their technique could one day turn fumbling robots into effective everyday servant. The work, funded by the U.S. Army Research Office, Microsoft the National Science Foundation, will be presented in detail in December.","Video shows robot almost stabbing a professor at Cornell University .

A career criminal has been accused of shooting five people to death – including his mother and an aunt – in a Monday night rampage that terrorized a Texas town. Charles Brownlow Jr., 36, was taken into custody early Tuesday morning by Terrell police after a high speed chase that followed him shooting five people and burning down the home he shared with his mother, according to reports. The final person shot by Mr Brownlow, Luis Leal, 22, was recently engaged and had just become a father, Fox DFW reported. Scroll down for video . In custody: Charles Brownlow Jr., was taken into custody Tuesday morning after a violnet rampage that left five dead in one Texas town . Authorities first became aware of the shooting spree after discovering the body of a woman believed to be Mr Brownlow’s aunt just after 5pm Monday, according to the Dallas Morning News. She was shot in the head, said officials. This would be the first in a series of grisly discoveries. ‘We're all in a state of shock. You have a tendency to think, 'How can that happen here?' Terrell Police Chief Jody Lay said during a press briefing. Shortly after that discovery, according to NBC DFW, police and firefighters responded to a nearby home on fire. The body of a woman believed to be Mr Brownlow’s mother was found inside. Senseless: Store clerk Luis Leal, 22, is wheeled out of Ali's Market after being shot dead by Mr Brownlow - he was a recently engaged father with a newborn son . Records show Mary Brownlow, 63, as living with Mr Brownlow at the Stallings Street address found on fire with a woman’s body inside. The fire is ‘obviously arson,’ an official told NBC DFW. ‘This is a country community, a rural community, people are real close and this is going to have a really big impact on us,’ Chief Lay said during the briefing. Mr Brownlow, who shared that home with his mother, stole her car and continued his violent bender, officials said. ‘This is a good community, and we don't know what happened and what triggered it all,’ neighbour Denise Fields told WFAA. After firing shots at a home thought to be his girlfriend’s – no one was injured, Mr Brownlow is accused of killing two more people. A man and a woman were discovered just before 10:30pm, WFAA reported. A three-year-old child found inside the house of horrors suffered no injuries, amazingly. A family devastated: Mr Leal poses with his son, now fatherless, and fiancee . Scene of a tragedy: Mr Leal's family gathered at Ali's to pay respects to their fallen loved one . A cousin of at least one of the victims, Clarence Graham, couldn’t believe what had happened.‘I'm still in shock about it,’ he told WFAA. ‘I've got to let it soak in. I don't know. It's something that's hard to deal with.’ Only 10 minutes later, Mr Brownlow is said by officials to have shot dead Mr Leal during an attempted robbery at Ali’s Market, a convenience store where he worked, according to reports. Andre Dye, a friend of Mr Brownlow’s, told local media that he doesn’t know what could have caused the shooting spree, that the accused killer is a good man. Footage of the scene showed Mr Leal’s shocked relatives gathered in the parking lot of the usually busy minimart. The violent thug was apprehended just before 1:30am Tuesday after a high speed chase that ended with him hiding in the woods and being found by a combination of a helicopter using a heat detecting camera and K-9 units. Horrified: Terrell Police Chief Jody Lay (right) said Mr Brownlow's actions will affect the town for a long time . Crime scene: Cops swarmed all over Terrell Texas to apprehend Mr Brownlow . Court records revealed Mr Brownlow has been convicted of a litany of criminal offenses dating back to the 1990s. Starting with nine months probation for multiple theft charges in 1998, Mr Brownlow has been in and out of courtrooms most of his life. He has also been convicted of multiple felony weapons and burglary charges, as well as domestic violence, drug possession and burglary of a vehicle. The convicted felon’s most recent sting in prison was from 2008 until 2011, records show. Mr Brownlow is currently in custody. Should he face capital murder charges, he would be eligible for the death penalty.","Charles Brownlow Jr., has been accused of shooting five people dead Monday evening .

When Brave was released, parents were rightfully delighted that finally a Disney film had been made with a strong female role model who didn’t need a Prince to whisk her off her feet. Unlike most other Disney heroines, the animation character of Princess Merida looked like a real girl, complete with the ‘imperfections’ most people have. But now the plucky freckled redhead has been given a makeover for a new range of toys – which critics claim has left the character looking ‘sexualised’. Brave choice? A realistic Merida as she appears in the film (left) and the beautified version as she appears in the new toy range (right) The character’s new doll and its promotional images appear slimmer, older and more glamorous compared with Merida’s more homespun tomboy look in last year’s Oscar-winning Pixar animation. The free-spirited Scottish archer has been given an unrealistically tiny waist, sleekly tousled hair, bigger eyes, a buxom chest, longer lashes and manicured eyebrows. And her new look has not gone down at all well with Brave fans. A petition calling on Disney to return the character to her more realistic origins has reached more than 200,000 signatures in less than two weeks. Merida is not a typical Disney heroine and became popular for her strength, feistiness and skill with a bow . And, according to critics on Twitter, . the makeover has stripped away the positive things Merida represented to . young girls – her confidence, disregard for the way she looks and her . lack of desire to be rescued by a handsome Prince. The mischievous, innocent look in her eye has also gone, they say. Now the petition, on the website change.org has gained the support of one of Merida’s original creators, Brenda Chapman. Mrs Chapman, who was replaced as director by Mark Andrews part way through the production of Brave but maintained a co-director’s credit, said: ‘I think it’s atrocious what they have done to Merida. ‘When little girls say they like [the new toy] because it’s more sparkly, that’s all fine and good but, subconsciously, they are soaking in the sexy “come-hither” look and the skinny aspect of the new version. It’s horrible!' The Disney princess range, with the controversial Merida in the centre . She added: ‘Merida was created to break that mould. To give young girls a better, stronger role model, a more attainable role model, something of substance, not just a pretty face that waits around for romance.’ Other characters in the Disney Princess Collection, including Snow White, Cinderella and the Little Mermaid’s Ariel, all have similar body shapes but appear to not have been altered from the original animations. Disney said it uses different styles of art on characters regularly, ‘changing them to fit their needs at the time’. Following complaints, Disney has removed the new Merida image from its Princess Collection website.","Merida from Brave appears sleeker and 'sexualised' in new incarnation .

Problem: Britain has the third highest proportion of sexually active teens and some the worst levels of underage drinking . Britain has the third highest proportion of sexually active teenagers in the world as well as some of the worst levels of harmful underage drinking, it has been revealed. Shocking statistics published in the medical journal the Lancet show that youngsters are more at risk from binge drinking, drug taking and sexually transmitted diseases than ever before. The research found that sexual activity among 13 to 15-year-olds was highest among girls in Denmark followed by Iceland, the UK and Sweden. Greece and Denmark had the highest rates among boys. The lowest rates in boys were in Belgium, and for girls Israel. England had the fourth highest percentage of youngsters who have been drunk by the age of 13 in a league table of 40 mostly high income countries. Wales was fifth and Scotland eighth. Wales was third for those drinking weekly at the age of 15, with England fourth and Scotland again eighth. The figures are taken from 2006, the last year with internationally comparable data, with new estimates in the coming months set to provide an opportunity for the UK to assess whether policies to reduce harmful drinking among teenagers have had any impact over the past five years. Teenagers' general well being has . improved far less over the last 50 years than that of children under 10 . with evidence suggesting adolescence is not the healthiest time of life, . as is often assumed. A . lack of focus on adolescent health could be described as a 'missing . link' in the approach to health, an international team of scientists . warn. The statistics are revealed in two . studies by Professor George Patton, of the University of Melbourne in . Australia, and colleagues which was published in The Lancet Series on . Adolescent Health. The . first paper says even the explosion in social media such as Facebook and . Twitter has both good and bad points for young people. Peer pressure: Statistics published in the medical journal the Lancet show that youngsters are more at risk from drug taking and sexually transmitted diseases than ever before . While it enables them to be catalysts for community change, as happened in the uprisings of the Middle East and North Africa, it also exposes adolescents to new risks such as cyber-bullying, and sexting, the act of sending sexually explicit or pornographic messages by mobile phone. There are now some 1.8 billion adolescents aged between ten and 24 in the world today, comprising more than a quarter of the population. The researchers said with longer periods in education, and significant delays to marriage or settling down, the period during which young people are exposed to the risks of adolescence has extended significantly. Such behaviours include harmful alcohol consumption and illicit drug use with peers, and sex with more casual partners, increasing the risk of sexually transmitted infections. Prof Patton said: 'The present generation of young people will take a different path through adolescence from previous generations and will face new challenges to their health and well-being along the way.' Programmes to promote maternal, . newborn and child health across countries of all incomes have led to . more children surviving and the current adolescent population boom, . known as the 'youth bulge'. Over . the same period digital media, industrialisation, globalisation and . urbanisation have changed traditional family and community influences, . resulting in less 'social scaffolding' of adolescents. The . researchers said many health-related behaviours that usually start in . adolescence such as smoking and drinking, obesity and physical . inactivity contribute to the epidemic of non-communicable diseases . including heart disease, cancer, diabetes and lung disease. New threat: The explosion in social media exposes adolescents to new risks such as cyber-bullying . Studies on adolescent brains suggest they are more affected than adults by exciting or stressful situations when making decisions. Increased activity in the nucleus accumbens, a reward and pleasure centre, appears linked to this. While the death rate among under fives has declined by 80 per cent or more in many countries in the past fifty years, adolescent mortality has only marginally improved. The major causes of disability-adjusted life years (DALYS), a measure that combines burden of mortality and disease, in adolescents are alcohol use (seven per cent), unsafe sex (four per cent), iron deficiency (three per cent), lack of contraception (two per cent) and drugs abuse (two per cent). Prof Patton said: 'Irrespective of region, most adolescent deaths are preventable and thus strongly justify worldwide action to enhance adolescent health. 'In view of their dynamic and challenging health profile, the contribution of adolescent health to the global burden of disease, and the important effect of adolescents and their health across the life course, adolescents should be more prominent within future global public health policies and programming.' The second paper revealed the UK had the fifteenth lowest rate for adolescent mortality in a league of 27 high income countries. The UK was also mid ranking for both boys and girls in cannabis use. Surprisingly, despite its obesity epidemic, boys aged 13 to 15 in the USA exercised more than boys in any other of the 16 countries reporting data, and American girls had the second highest levels of exercise behind Ireland, which was in second place for boys. The UK finished eighth best for girls in the amount of exercise they did, and fifth best for boys out of sixteen countries reporting data. Prof Patton added: 'For the largest generation in the world's history, the available global profile of youth health is worrying.'","Youngsters 'more at risk from binge drinking, drug taking and STDs than ever before'

The world's longest commercial flight completed its final 9,534mile journey from New Jersey to Singapore this weekend. Singapore Airlines had been running the grueling near-19 hour flight since 2004, but finally decided to pull the journey from its schedules reportedly because it was becoming too expensive to run. The route, best known as SQ21, has been taken out of service weeks after a route linking Los Angeles, California, and Singapore was ceased by the airline in October. No more: Singapore Airlines has decommissioned the world's longest scheduled commercial flight which linked Newark Airport in New Jersey with Changi Airport in Singapore . Singapore Airlines, which announced the decision to stop the routes in 2012, says that the decision was made because it is selling its gas-guzzling A340 jets back to Airbus in exchange for new A380s which aren't designed for such long flights. But reports suggest that the increasing . cost of fuel has meant that the route, between Newark Airport and Changi . International Airport, is no longer profitable. Now that the Singapore to New Jersey route has been taken off schedules, what are the top ten longest commercial flights? According to NJ.com, the price of a barrel of fuel stood at around $28.88 (£17.82) when the route first took off. But the price of the same amount of fuel has shot up to around $107 (£66) today. The route, which flew over the Arctic Circle, set travellers back between $6,000 and $8,000 (£3,700 - £4,936) return and was popular with bankers flying between New York and Singapore. But passengers got business class luxury travel for the price of their ticket. The planes only seated up to 100 passengers, all in business class, with seats measuring 36 inches wide - twice the width of a standard plane seat. Each seat had its own 15 inch television screen and a vast film library of 243 titles to choose from, 358 television shows, an 800 CD library, 22 radio stations and 80 video games to keep them occupied on the long journey. Other airlines operate the same plane with about 250 seats in first, business and economy classes. The non-stop route saved travellers around three hours when compared to a journey including a stop-off elsewhere. Instead travellers wishing to go between New Jersey and Singapore will now have to stop at Frankfurt, Germany. The longest commercial flight available to passengers now is between Sydney, Australia, and Dallas, Texas - a route which is 8,578 miles long and takes around 15 hours and 25 minutes. Costly trip: The airline found the only way to make the routes profitable was by configuring the plane with 98 business class seats that sell for about $8,000 for a return (file picture)","The Singapore Airlines flight linked Newark Airport and Changi Airport .

Many children are sent by parents from the rural regions in northeastern Thailand to Bangkok and other major cities to training camps in the hopes that their sons will become good fighters and be able to help the family financially. Televised fights are the most popular shows on television and the streets empty when big fights are being held, in villages all over the country people cluster around any available television. The popular sport is deeply entwined with the country’s history and was developed centuries ago as a way for Thai men to a way to defend themselves without using weapons. Never-ending invasions from neighbouring countries in the early days of the Kingdom saw the people of Thailand rely on hand-to-hand combat to defend their land. Muay Thai is also called the 'Art of Eight Limbs' or the 'Science Of Eight Limbs' as it uses eight points of contacts: hands, elbows, knees and feet when punching and kicking. The word Muay derives from mavya, a word meaning ‘to bind together’ in Sanskrit.

Former West Ham striker Frederic Kanoute . - also a Muslim - was allowed by Sevilla to wear an unbranded shirt . while they were sponsored by gambling company 888.com. Newcastle signed a £24million deal with Wonga to replace Virgin Money as Newcastle's sponsors last year. The move provoked anger with some fans who were unhappy with the club being sponsored by a company which charges up to 5,853 per cent annual interest on short term loans.

The mother who allowed her son Baby P to be tortured to death is 'desperate' for a new man now she is out of prison, it has been alleged. Tracey Connelly, 32, is said to have disgusted women at her bail hostel, where she has a new identity, with her conversations about men and sex. Connelly was jailed indefinitely in 2009 after she admitted doing nothing while her little boy was tortured to death by her boyfriend Steven Barker and his paedophile brother Jason Owen. Free: Tracey Connelly seen taking a stroll in the park weeks after being released on parole . According to The Sun, Connelly now regularly speaks about sex and men at her bail hostel after being released on parole at the end of October. A source told the paper: 'After being locked up for so long she is desperate for a man. 'And by the way she talks, any man will do.' She has also recently been photographed taking a stroll in a park weeks after her release from prison. Wearing . a brown cardigan, blue trousers, trainers and a colourful scarf, she . was seen walking with her arms folded talking to two companions. She was spotted as she adjusts to life outside prison after being released on parole from jail. Connelly, pictured walking in the park this week (left), was jailed indefinitely in 2009.

The case provoked a national scandal after it emerged that social workers, police and doctors missed a series of warning signs that could have saved the child’s life. As she was granted parole, Connelly had begged for an anonymity order and round-the-clock police protection, but ministers refused. These orders are rare and only four are currently in force. These apply to child killer Mary Bell, James Bulger’s murderers Robert Thompson and Jon Venables and to Maxine Carr, who provided a false alibi for Soham murderer Ian Huntley. Indefinite sentences: Tracey Connelly's boyfriend Steven Barker (left) and his paedophile brother Jason Owen (right) were both convicted of causing or allowing Peter's death . Instead Connelly has been given a new name and released far from her old home where Peter was killed.

The inhabitants of the Solomon Islands - east of Papua New Guinea - are very dark-skinned - but have puzzled scientists for decades with their blond hair. Now a genetic study has found that the islanders have a 'homegrown' gene that gives them blond hair - and it's different from the one in Europeans. ‘Its frequency is between 5 and 10 . percent across the Solomon Islands, which is about the same as where I'm . from,’ said study author Eimear Kenny, PhD, who was born in Ireland. A genetic study has found that the islanders have a 'homegrown' gene that gives them blond hair - and it's different from the one in Europeans . 'Its frequency is between 5 and 10 percent across the Solomon Islands, which is about the same as where I'm from,' said study author Eimear Kenny, PhD, who was born in Ireland . Gathering the data, accomplished in 2009 by Myles and co-first author Nicholas Timpson, PhD, was more difficult. Much of the Solomon Islands is undeveloped, without roads, electricity or telephones . Globally, blond hair is rare, occurring with substantial frequency only in northern Europe and in Oceania, which includes the Solomon Islands and its neighbors. Many assumed the blond hair of Melanesia was the result of gene flow — a trait passed on by European explorers, traders and others who visited in the preceding centuries. The islanders themselves give several possible explanations for its presence - they generally chalked it up to sun exposure, or a diet rich in fish, say the researchers. ‘Within a week we had our initial result. It was such a striking signal pointing to a single gene — a result you could hang your hat on. That rarely happens in science,’ said Kenny. 'It was one of the best experiences of my career.’ In terms of genetic studies, the analysis was straightforward, said Kenny. But gathering the data, accomplished in 2009 by Myles and co-first author Nicholas Timpson, PhD, was more difficult. Much of the Solomon Islands is undeveloped, without roads, electricity or telephones. It's also one of the most linguistically diverse nations in the world, with dozens of languages spoken.‘They have this very dark skin and bright blond hair. It was mind-blowing,’ said Myles. ‘As a geneticist on the beach watching the kids playing, you count up the frequency of kids with blond hair, and say, 'Wow, it's 5 to 10 percent.' Around 5-10 per cent of the population of the Solomon Islands have blond hair - but it's due to an entirely different gene from Europeans . The Solomon Islands: Many assumed the blond hair of Melanesia was the result of gene flow ¿ a trait passed on by European explorers, traders and others who visited in the preceding centuries . Myles and Timpson went village to village explaining what they wanted to do and asking for permission to gather data, Myles speaking in Solomon Islands pidgin, the most widely understood language. When the local chief gave the OK, the researchers recruited participants and assessed hair and skin color using a light reflectance meter, took blood pressure readings and measured heights and weights. They asked the villagers to spit into small tubes to provide saliva to be used for DNA extraction. In the span of a month they collected more than 1,000 samples. Soon after, Kenny joined the lab and started the analysis, selecting 43 blond- and 42 dark-haired Solomon Islanders from the opposite 10 percent extremes of the hair pigmentation range. She used these in a genome-wide association study, a method to reveal differences in the frequency of genetic variants between two groups, that usually requires thousands of samples. Because the vast majority of human physical characteristics analyzed to date have many genetic and environmental factors, Kenny expected an inconclusive result that would require much further study. Instead, she immediately saw a single strong signal on chromosome 9, which accounted for 50 percent of the variance in the Solomon Islanders' hair color. The team went on to identify the gene responsible, TYRP1, which encodes tyrosinase-related protein 1, an enzyme previously recognized as influencing pigmentation in mice and humans. Further research revealed that the particular variant responsible for blond hair in the Solomon Islands is absent in the genomes of Europeans. ‘So the human characteristic of blond hair arose independently in equatorial Oceania. That's quite unexpected and fascinating,’ Kenny said.","Many assumed blonde hair came from Europeans .

U.S. commandos were just hours away from launching a raid this month to capture a militiaman wanted in the deadly Benghazi terror attack, according to officials. Special forces were waiting for orders to capture Ahmed Abu Khattalah, part of the Ansar Al-Sharia militia, but the mission failed to materialize according to CNN. The order never came after a terrorist wanted over the 1998 attack on the U.S. Embassy in Kenya was seized in the Libyan capital Tripoli. Attack: A protester shouts outside the burning U.S. consulate in Benghazi where four Americans were killed in September 2012 . Wanted: The FBI has released the images of three men caught on security cameras at the compound before the attack that it wants to question . Publicity surrounding the October 5 capture of Abu Anas al-Libi, a suspect in the 1998 terror attack, put the imminent Khattalah . mission in jeopardy, according . to some officials. It was feared that a second U.S. raid in Libya could destabilize the country's already fragile government. Raid: Terror suspect Abu Anas al-Libi was caught in an October 5 raid in Tripoli . Khattalah is believed to be behind the . armed assault on the U.S. Embassy that killed ambassador Christopher . Stevens and three other Americans. President Obama said it was a 'priority' to bring the Benghazi suspects 'to justice'. Khattalah is under federal indictment and the FBI is still investigating the attack. The agency has published photographs of people seen at the compound on the night of the raid, who it wants to question. Although the Libyan government publicly denounced the capture of al-Libi it had given the U.S. secret services permission to work in the country. American officials have a list of about 12 suspects they want to question about the attack. However, the planned raid earlier this month may have been one of the closest times forces have come to fulfilling a mission, officials said. Khattalah, who was interviewed by CNN's Arwa Damon in July, has worked openly in Benghazi for months but it was only in October that the U.S. had enough information on his specific whereabouts. A top level meeting was due to get the final sign off from President Obama around October 7, officials told CNN. The mission was never carried out however, in part because publicity over the arrest of al-Libi led the White House to fear a raid in Benghazi would destabilize the already fragile Libyan government. The kidnapping of Prime Minister Ali Zeidan after al-Libi was seized highlighted these concerns, leading U.S. officials to conclude the Libyan government may not survive a second raid. Although the raid was halted, the mission to capture the Benghazi suspects has not been shelved.

Damning: Nurses are ignoring desperately ill patients when they need help, a report has found . Nurses are ignoring desperately ill patients and their relatives when they need help, a damning report has found. In one case, a nurse told the husband of a patient who was being violently ill: ‘I am a graduate. I don’t do sick’. In another, a relative had to wait for assistance until staff had finished bidding on eBay. The report, published yesterday, is based on 2,500 accounts from patients, relatives and carers collected by the Department of Health over the past six months. The testimony includes comments from former nurses, who warn that standards within the profession are declining because of a lack of discipline, compassion and leadership. The review, commissioned by the Department of Health, was written jointly by Ann Clwyd, the Labour MP who broke down in the House of Commons last year as she described how her husband had died in hospital ‘like a battery hen’. Mrs Clwyd was later appointed by the Prime Minister to carry out a thorough review of how the NHS deals with complaints, amid concerns most are just brushed aside. Some of the evidence is damning. One relative said: ‘I went to the nursing station on one occasion to see the entire team bidding at the end of an eBay auction. I was kept waiting, ignored, until it was ended.’ Labour MP Ann Clwyd wept last year as she described how her beloved husband had died in hospital ‘from the cold and from people who didn’t care’. 'He was very distressed': Labour MP Ann Clwyd with her late husband Owen Roberts . She spoke of the ‘coldness, indifference and contempt’ of nurses and how her pleas for help were ‘brushed aside’. Her 73-year-old husband, Owen Roberts, was being treated in the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff for pneumonia. He also suffered from multiple sclerosis. Mrs Clywd, 76, said: ‘He didn’t have any clothes over him, he was half covered by two, very thin, inadequate sheets, his feet were sticking out of the bed at an angle, and he was extremely cold. I tried to cover him with a towel.’ At one stage, she said, her 6ft 2in husband was ‘squashed up against the iron bars of the bed’. She added: ‘He was very distressed and totally aware of his situation and, although unable to speak because of the oxygen mask, he made it clear he was cold and wanted to come home. Well, a few hours later, he died. ‘I kept asking people. I would go into the corridor and there were just no nurses around. I stopped one nurse in the corridor and asked her why he wasn’t in intensive care. ‘She said: “There are lots of people worse than him”, and she walked on.’ The husband of another patient said: ‘When visiting my wife ... after an operation to mend her broken hip, I asked a nurse for help as she was being very, very sick. ‘She announced, “I am a graduate. I don’t do sick” and left me to deal with the situation.’ A former nurse who had been visiting a loved one in hospital said: ‘At some of the most important events of the day, meal times, when it should be all hands on deck, the staff are nowhere to be seen. 'What on earth can they be doing that takes precedence?’ Other retired nurses who contributed to the report warned that the profession had become less caring because it lacked leadership, compassion and a sense of responsibility towards patients. Lack of care: Mrs Clwyd, left, says her husband died in hospital 'like a battery hen', while Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, right, says there can be no 'no place for covering backs' when patient safety is at stake . They said nurses today were more . concerned with complicated medical tasks such as taking readings rather . than changing dressings, washing or feeding. Other . relatives were critical of senior doctors, some of whom were described . as ‘pompous’, ‘arrogant’, ‘condescending’ and ‘uncaring’. Referring . to a consultant, the daughter of one patient said: ‘This was a man with . a train of young doctors in tow, moulding them in the same uncaring . way.’ The report concluded . that there had been a ‘decade of failure’ in terms of the way the NHS . dealt with complaints. Some relatives had been left waiting six years . for an apology. Last year . more than 162,000 complaints were made to the health service – 450 a day . – but many were deliberately ignored or forgotten about. Testimony: In one case, a nurse told the husband of a patient who was being violently ill: 'I am a graduate. I don't do sick'. In another, a relative had to wait for assistance until staff had finished bidding on eBay . Mrs Clwyd said: ‘When I made public the circumstances of my own husband’s death last year, I was shocked by the deluge of correspondence from people whose experience of hospitals was heartbreaking. It made me determined to do my best to get change in the system. ‘We have given patients and their families a voice in this report, and their message to the NHS on complaints is clear. ‘The days of delay, deny, and defend must end, and hospitals must become open, learning organisations.’ Mrs Clywd wrote the report with Professor Tricia Hart, a former nurse and chief executive of South Tees hospital. They call for a major overhaul for how the NHS handles complaints. Recommendations include giving patients a piece of paper and a pen by their bedside to note down concerns or make recommendations for improvements. The report also tells hospitals to investigate every complaint thoroughly and produce a report at the end of each year explaining how they have been dealt with. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘I want to see a complete transformation in hospitals’ approach to complaints, so that they become valued as vital learning tools. 'There can be no place for closing ranks or covering backs when patient safety is at stake.’ More than 2,500 patients, relatives and former NHS staff – including nurses – gave evidence for the report. Here are some of their comments: .","Nurses are ignoring desperately ill patients and their relatives, says report .

An 18-year-old girl who was paralyzed in a car crash last year and told she would never walk again has miraculously defied the odds by walking down the aisle for her sister's wedding. With her brother and the best man at her side at the ceremony in September, Mackenzie Gorden slowly moved forward - achieving her dream and revealing her inspiring determination. She has been able to stand again thanks to a groundbreaking new therapy, 'locomotor', at Craig Hospital in Englewood, Colorado that recreates walking motions by force until the spinal cord learns how to control the muscles. 'I never accepted that I couldn't walk . again,' Gorden, from Lake City, Iowa, told the Denver Post. 'If I don't want to be in the chair, I've got to do . something myself to get out of it.' Fighter: Mackenzie Gorden, 18, is pictured . walking down the aisle at her sister's wedding last month - just 15 . months after she was paralyzed in a car accident and told she would . never walk again . Success! She stands with her brother and brother-in-law after successfully walking down the aisle . Gorden was a cheerleader looking forward to captaining her team on a summer trip to Hawaii when she broke her neck in June 2012 after she swerved to avoid a deer and rolled her truck into a ditch. She could see her cellphone ringing but her limbs were numb and pinned beneath her. Two hours later, an off-duty emergency responder stumbled upon her while out for a motorcycle ride. In the days after the life-changing accident, she overheard doctors saying how she would never walk again and a pyschologist said she should re-think her dream of becoming a nurse. Weeks into her recovery, she spent seven weeks in hospital in Rochester, Minnesota before moving to the hospital in Colorado, where she was taught how to use a wheelchair and start moving her fingers again so she could brush her hair. Stunning: She is pictured left with her sister, Brittanie, and right, back in her wheelchair following the feat . Proud: She is pictured with her parents at her school prom. She is now hoping to become a nurse . Mackenzie Gorden is among thousands of paralyzed patients . who are undergoing a grueling therapy called locomotor. The patient stands on a treadmill with a harness from the ceiling carrying much of their weight. Then as the treadmill moves, therapists recreate the motion of walking by force - moving the limbs and joints as if taking steps. Repetition of this allows the spinal cord to learn to control muscles the brain used to . control. While no two patients respond to the therapy the same way, all do experience a change as a result. One attractive trait of the therapy is that, even if the . patient never walks, the movement - even one created by an outside force - gives massive benefits to the body, such as building muscle and bone density, speeding up circulation and warding off obesity. Then on her first meeting with her care team, one of her doctors, Dr. William Scelza, came in on a wheelchair and she learned he was paralyzed in a car crash when he was 17. She thought: 'If he went to med school. I can be a nurse.' She returned to Iowa for her senior year, where she cheered from her chair and, six months later went for a check up at Craig Hospital, where she learned she was a good candidate to try walking. By the end of the school year, she could stand up for 26 seconds - and appeared in her prom photos standing tall beside her parents and friends. Two months later, she could stand for five minutes. She also began using a exoskelen to help her walk - a frame that supports her legs, keeps her upright and moves by feeling her intentions by how she shifts her weight. 'I feel like I either have on a jet pack or a leaf blower,' she said of the feeling. Life-changing: She is pictured left before the car crash in June 2012 and right in hospital afterwards . Treatment: Gorden undergoes water therapies and a new training called 'locomotor' in which therapists recreate the movement of walking by force before her spinal cord learns how to do it . Persevering: She continued to cheer from her chair throughout her senior year of high school . With the other locomotor therapies, overhead hoists take as much as 30 per cent of her body weight away as therapists push her joints and limbs to recreate walking on a treadmill. By doing this, her spinal cord will learn the movement that her brain once ordered. 'I've never seen her shed a tear,' her mother Karen Gorden told the Post.

Tragedy: Retired headmaster Denis Drew and wife Joyce, both 86, died after they were knocked down while on their regular evening walk . A devoted couple walking hand in hand on a quiet village road were knocked down and killed on the stroll they took together every evening. Retired headmaster Denis Drew and wife Joyce, both 86, were last seen holding hands on their regular evening walk after 54 years of marriage. Both were hit by a blue hatchback car and rushed to hospital. Mrs Drew died hours later and her husband died in hospital after five days in a critical condition. A 20-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of death by dangerous driving and released on police bail after the incident a fortnight ago. The couple's family today described them as 'a duo' who were always holding hands right up until their last moment together. Daughters Sarah England, 53, and Helen Adam, 50, said the deaths had left them 'completely devastated with a huge hole in our lives.' Mr and Mrs Drew were pedestrians as they walked through their home village of Ponthir, near Caerleon, Gwent. The family say one comfort is that the devoted couple were together up until their last moments. Mrs England said: 'Everyone we have spoken to has said they can't imagine one without the other. 'We feel very privileged to have had them as parents. The effect that they had on a lot of people makes us feel very proud of them.' Former RAF airman Mr Drew trained as a teacher - and met his wife on a blind date. He was a headteacher in three primary school in Gwent before he retired. Incident: The couple, who were married for 54 years, were hit as they walked through their home village of Ponthir (pictured), near Caerleon, Gwent . His daughter said: 'He just seemed to have a very gentle and patient nature but he was actually very strong and tough.' Mrs Drew was a registrar of births, deaths and marriages in Pontypool, Gwent, but was a stalwart member of village Woman's Institute. Mrs Adam said: 'She ruled the roost but she also knew if dad put his foot down. They were a duo.' Lifelong friend Glyn Parry, 86, said: 'They were a devoted and loving couple.

Lullabies don’t only help babies get off to sleep, they also ease pain. A study found that Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star, Hush a Bye Baby and other well-loved children’s songs helped patients in Great Ormond Street Hospital feel better. Heart rates dropped and the children, including toddlers waiting for heart transplants and babies as young as a week old, were in visibly less pain. In contrast, reading stories complete with pop-up pictures and animal sounds had no effect. Musical medicine: Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star, Hush a Bye Baby and other well-loved children's songs helped to ease pain in sick children . The researchers say this shows that the effect can’t be explained by the children simply being soothed by the extra attention. Instead, there is something special about being sung to. Researcher Dr Nick Pickett, who has provided music therapy at the world-famous hospital for two decades, said: ‘Parents have been singing to their children for thousands of years and they have always instinctively known that it helps their children relax – but it is exciting to have some scientific evidence that lullabies offer genuine health benefits for the child.’ Dr Pickett sang a selection of lullabies to 37 patients at Great Ormond Street Hospital and monitored their heart rate and signs of pain, including crying, grimacing and squirming. The tests were also done when the youngsters were read to and when they were left to sit quietly. Only the lullabies reduced their heart rate and the amount of pain they were in, the journal Psychology of Music reports. It is thought that the calming tones ease pain by distracting the children from their illness. Ian Bowers, whose three-year-old . daughter Keira has been in hospital since June, said: ‘It perks her . right up.  It makes her feel wanted.  It does leave a lasting . impression.’ Soothing: It's thought that the calming tones of lullabies ease pain by distracting the children from their illness . Professor Tim Griffiths, a neuroscientist with the Wellcome Trust told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that music seems better than story-telling at tapping into the brain’s emotional centre. Dr Pickett said that live music is likely to be better at easing pain than recordings. He said: ‘Babies and young children respond to the singer’s voice first and instruments second. ‘More than one instrument can actually become quite confusing and less effective. 'Facial expressions and visual stimulation during the performance of a lullaby are just as important and live performance allows the adult to adapt their singing depending on the child’s mood.’ Other studies to find that music benefits children’s health include one from the US, in which newborns played lullabies put on more weight and were discharged more quickly from intensive care. Although some hospitals do offer music therapy on children’s wards, it is generally paid for by charity money, rather than the NHS.","Songs such as Twinkle, Twinkle .

A photographer has won a landmark legal battle with retail giant Next after his picture of a stunt biker was taken off the internet, adapted and printed on children's T-shirts without his permission. Father-of-three Allan Potts, 55, captured the image of rider Arran Powley at the annual Shropshire County Show in Shrewsbury in June 2010. It shows the 23-year-old in mid-air with both his hands off the handlebars and his legs to one side of the red bike. But Mr Potts admitted he was stunned when . he spotted his photograph on a child's T-shirt while out shopping, with the biker's head replaced with that of a chimp. Spot the difference: Keen motorcycle photographer Allan Potts' picture, left, was stolen and printed on T-shirts by Next, right, who have settled over the matter . A supplier for the high street chain had found the original picture on the internet and taken it without his permission. The extreme sports photographer launched a legal battle with Next this summer over the unauthorised use of his picture. And in a landmark victory on Friday Next accepted his ownership of the photo and agreed to pay him undisclosed damages. Offending item: Next has accepted Mr Potts' his ownership of the photo and agreed to pay him undisclosed damages after selling this T-shirt . The company will now send all remaining stock of the shirt - which had appeared in its directory, online and in its 500 UK stores - to aid charity Oxfam for its overseas work. It has also emerged Next has even offered more money to buy the image - but he refused 'on principle.' Mr Potts, from Corwen in Denbighshire, mid-Wales, said: 'The original image is so easy to recognise, there was absolutely no doubt in my mind that they ripped off my shot and mass produced it on a T-shirt selling for £5 to £10. 'It was fortunate that my original copyrighted image was so easily recognisable by FMX (freestyle motocross) followers. 'So I was soon alerted to the misuse of this photograph and felt it was vital to take action to stop its use as soon as possible. 'Donating the remaining t-shirts to Oxfam means that some good has come from this episode and will mean that it remains a much more pleasant memory for me than it otherwise could have been.' Charlotte Clode, from law firm FBC Manby Bowdler who represented him, added: 'Allan was understandably worried that it could harm his reputation if it was thought he had sold this picture to the fashion chain. 'We therefore had to act fast to protect his reputation. 'In this case, Allan was able to produce a photograph which was timed and dated as evidence he owned copyright in the image. 'It was also accepted that the photograph was used without his consent when it became apparent that Next's supplier had simply found the original image online. 'Those factors all meant the matter could be resolved promptly by agreement.' A spokesman for Next said: 'The T-shirts have been withdrawn from sale. 'The remaining stock is being collated in our warehouse ready to be donated to Oxfam.' Dispute: Rihanna won a battle with Topshop . over a T-shirt bearing the picture of her face, seen left, which she . claimed is similar to one of her album covers and could mislead fans . into believing the item was 'genuine' Earlier this year pop superstar Rihanna won a permanent ban on Topshop selling t-shirts using her image.

Tragedy: Victoria Harrison, 17, bled to death after an artery was torn during a routine operation, an inquest heard . A teenage hairdresser bled to death over 15 hours after a surgeon tore an artery during a routine operation, an inquest heard today. Victoria Harrison died in her bed at Kettering General Hospital, whose staff failed her in 43 different ways. The 17-year-old was so scared for her life she even texted a picture of her blood-soaked T-shirt to her boyfriend in the hours before she died. She was admitted to hospital for routine key-hole surgery on August 15 last year after suffering abdominal pains. But during the 30-minute operation to remove her appendix, she suffered internal bleeding when surgeons tore a hole in an artery while inserting a micro-camera into her stomach. Staff managed to repair the hole but she lost almost half a pint of blood and she was sent to recover on a ward, but died the next day. An inquest at the Best Western Hotel in Corby, Northamptonshire, heard nurses failed to read her medical notes which indicated she had suffered a large bleed during surgery. She was not properly checked and nurses failed to take her blood pressure which would have indicated her blood loss. Despite complaining of being in pain nurses gave her morphine until she suffered heart failure and died at 7am on August 16. Her death also sparked a huge investigation by hospital into her care. A report by Kettering General Hospital NHS Foundation Trust found staff made 43 errors while caring for Miss Harrison. Bereft: Victoria's mother Tracy Foskett and sister Sarah Francis have demanded answers about how their loved-one died . Damning: A report by Kettering General Hospital NHS Foundation Trust found its staff made 43 errors while caring for Miss Harrison there before she died . The inquest heard her surgeon Shady Hosny said one of the abdominal wall arteries started bleeding during the operation. Within 30 minutes the bleeding had stopped but it was unclear from medical notes how much blood she had lost exactly but Mr Hosny confirmed it was more than normal during such an operation. Life lost: Victoria was admitted to hospital for the simple operation on August 15 this year, but within 15 hours she had died . In a statement read to the inquest he said: 'During the procedure, I noted that there was minimal blood yet as it was a small amount, I was not concerned at this stage and continued to perform the appendicectomy.' Mr Hosny was later exonerated of blame following a hospital investigation. When the two hour operation was completed at 4pm Victoria was then transferred to a recovery ward. Gillian Joy, the recovery nurse looking after Victoria told the inquest she had not been told the patient had bled during the surgery and did not read the operation notes. She said: 'I would expect the scrub nurse to tell me about any excessive bleed. I would have then informed the ward nurse. 'Initially Victoria told me she had a slight pain but she was more concerned about feeling nauseous. 'Later she stated she was pain free and was just anxious to see her boyfriend.' Victoria was then discharged to a main ward at 5.20pm. Julie Walsh, a staff nurse at the hospital, was then in charge of Victoria's care. She gave her painkillers at 6.15pm at which point she was being comforted by fiancé Ashley Warner. Hours after he left he was alarmed when Victoria, who he called 'Tor', texted him a picture of her bleeding. Let down: 'Tor', as she was known to her family, texted her fiancé with a picture of a blood-soaked T-shirt because she was scared . In a statement he said: 'We spoke for about an hour, Tor said she felt fine. 'She was looking forward to coming home the next day and telling me how everyone had to look after her and she wanted a bit of pampering. Family: Victoria's step-father Stan Foskett and her mother Tracy Foskett and her father Andrew Harrison demanded a probe into her death . 'I left at the end of visiting, she still seemed fine, very relaxed and she was texting friends on her mobile phone. 'That was the last time I saw her. 'We were texting each other most of the evening, I've no idea what time it was that I got the first message from Tor saying that she was in pain, but the doctor had been and given her some pain relief. 'A bit later I then got a message saying that she was bleeding from one of the holes from the operation and she sent me a picture. 'She was wearing grey jogging bottoms, I can't remember what coloured top she was wearing, but I could clearly see a large amount of blood on her abdomen. 'There was blood on her T-shirt and I could see the blood coming from one of the holes and I could see where the blood had trickled down her front. 'The next text I got from Tor said ""nurse is here she's sorting it now"".' When Mrs Walsh finished her shift care assistant Debbie Sumpter took over at 5.30am on August 16. She said in a statement read at the inquest: 'I started the rounds at 5.30am and as I was helping another patient I looked over to Victoria and could tell something wasn't right. 'She looked pale and stiff. I went over and shook her and shouted her name but there was no response.' An arrest team then tried to resuscitate Victoria for nearly 40 minutes and she was given two units of emergency blood but she was pronounced dead at 7am. Staff nurse Marites Salvador broke down in tears giving her evidence when she admitted not carrying out 'a proper observation' when Victoria was asleep. She told the inquest: 'I just can't get it out of my mind. 'I saw Victoria lying there and I pulled the emergency cord. 'I didn't do a proper observation as she was asleep and I didn't want to disturb her. 'I'm just so sorry. When I saw her she was reading her book.' The inquest heard Kettering General Hospital carried out an investigation after Victoria's death. Head of nursing practising development Jacqueline Davis said an investigation found 43 different care delivery issues in Victoria's case. The inquest is expected to finish tomorrow. Findings: Victoria's was let down in 43 different ways, Kettering General Hospital has admitted . 1. Wrong surgeon documented on theatre documentation. 2.

Post-sandwich guilt may become a thing of the past thanks to a baker who has created the UK's lowest calorie bread. The London-based City banker-turned-baker has launched Plan Bread - a unique sandwich delivery business that provides a virtually carb-free, low calorie super-bread... made from broccoli. Paul Shackleton, who was made redundant from his trader job at JP Morgan last year, decided to leave the bright lights of the City behind him once and for all, and turn his hand to baking. A dieter's dream: Using all natural produce and broccoli as the main ingredient, Paul created the lowest carb bread in the UK . Banker turned baker: Despite having no baking experience, former banker Paul Shackleton taught himself how to make the lowest carb bread in the UK . Despite having no experience in oven-based work, the 27-year-old set himself the challenge of creating the world's healthiest bread. He spent hours poring over books in the British Library, studying the latest medical research on how food is stored as fat, and meticulously devised more than 150 prototypes before arriving at Plan Bread's secret recipe. Using all natural produce and broccoli as the main ingredient, Paul created the lowest carb bread in the UK - as accredited by UKAS (United Kingdom Accreditation Service). Plan Bread's special recipe has 50 per cent fewer calories and 94 per cent fewer carbs than other popular breads. Low carb: After hours of perfection, Plan Bread's special recipe has 50 per cent fewer calories and 94 per cent fewer carbs than other popular breads . As a comparison, 100g of popular, supermarket-bought seeded loaves have 300 calories and 34g of carbohydrate, while 100g of Paul's bread has only 137 calories and just 2g of carbohydrate. The bread will appeal to the likes of super health-conscious Gwyneth Paltrow, because it is also gluten-free, soy-free, and almost zero GI. Paul, who is based in central London, has spent much of the last six months rising at 2am to bake for the day ahead conducting an extensive testing and sampling programme to ensure that his recipe is perfect. Early riser: Paul has spent much of the last six months rising at 2am to bake for the day ahead . Speaking about his exciting new business venture, Paul said: 'In my old job, I always felt guilty eating unhealthy sandwiches at lunchtime. 'I discovered that my colleagues had cut them out of their diet, with no alternatives available. We all thought, surely there must be a better way. 'That's really how Plan Bread was born - the aim of the venture was always to find a truly healthy alternative to the high street sandwich, where no low carbohydrate option was available. 'It wasn't until I started baking that more and more mates started mentioning that they no longer eat bread. 'Gluten intolerance was also far more prevalent than I had realised. Zero gluten then became a key idea behind the product as well, and I feel really pleased that the sandwiches will be available to as many people as possible, not excluding anyone.' He continued: 'Some people thought I was mad, and, to be honest, at times I did feel a little like an alchemist. But I was always confident in the science behind the process, and am thrilled to have found a result which people are now enjoying. 'We have been very encouraged by the initial feedback to the business and product and will be looking to expand our menu and delivery area throughout 2013.' Plan Bread delivers platters and individual sandwiches to addresses across West and Central London as well as catering for larger corporate events and supplying office canteens. Each sandwich is priced between £3.75 and £4.50 and Paul plans to open a series of sandwich shops around London then look to move to outside London once established. He added: 'The plan is also to greatly expand the range of products. Firstly we are working on a greater line of breads (red cabbage, courgette and some others are in the test stage at the moment). 'Then want to move on to other bread like products namely pizzas.' If there was one food I had to eat forever it would be bread. So when I found out about Plan Bread I was more than excited at the prospect of being able to do 'carbs before marbs'. But with broccoli as the key ingredient, could this really taste as good as a classic hunk of Hovis? After getting over the bread's slightly green tinge, I tucked in. What can only be described as a cross between an omelet and brioche, with more bites, the bread tasted really good. And the best part? The sandwich was crammed full of fresh poached salmon, watercress and a light mayonnaise sauce all for just 219 calories (a Marks and Spencer's equivalent would see you devour over 800 calories). It may not taste as good as a crisp petite pan with slatherings of butter, but this is the perfect lunchtime fix for dieters who are partial to committing the occasional carbicide.","Paul Shackleton, 27, made redundant from London bank job at JP Morgan .

A shipment of highly radioactive material has been safely recovered after sitting in the cornfield where it was found a week ago dumped by truck thieves in central Mexico. The truckload of cobalt-60, a material that can be used to make dirty bombs, was secured on Tuesday evening and the Mexican nuclear safety director confirmed that the week-long saga is now under wraps. Juan Eibenschutz, director general of the National Commission of Nuclear Safety and Safeguards, said a robot was used to scoop up the dangerous material and deposit it in a safe container for transporting to a nuclear waste treatment facility. Carefully handled: A robotic arm was used to recover the radioactive cobalt-60 that was discovered abandoned in the middle of farmland in central Mexico . Under watch: Even though the material was secured on Tuesday afternoon, 100 federal police, marines and local officers are still guarding the area . 'It's been recovered, and it's on its way to the waste site,' he said. Earlier Tuesday, Eibenschutz had said the cobalt-60 was still in the field because emergency workers hadn't been able to get the robot close enough due to bales of corn stalks in the field. He said workers were clearing a path. Containment: The material, which is normally used in making dirty bombs, was stored in a container approved by the country's nuclear safety board . 'Things turned out well,' he said a few hours later. 'The operators of the robot prepared everything and were able to secure the material.' The federal police force said it provided the robot. The final statement revealed that 100 federal police, marines and local officers are still guarding the area. Eibenschutz said a farmer was being checked at a hospital after showing signs of radiation exposure. The . man, who lives in the nearby farming town of Hueypoxtla, told . authorities that he handled the material after finding it in the field . and started feeling sick soon after. The . cobalt-60, which was from obsolete medical equipment used in radiation . therapy, was being transported to a waste facility by a truck that was . stolen at gunpoint early December 2 when the driver stopped to rest at a . gas station in Hidalgo state. Two days later, authorities found the truck abandoned in neighboring Mexico state. The thieves had removed the cobalt-60 from its protective container and left it nearby in the field about a half a mile from Hueypoxtla, a town of about 4,000 people. Found: A container of cobalt-60, similar to this one, was found 1lkm away from the truck it was being carried in . Calming fears: Mexico's National Commission for Nuclear Safety and Safeguards (CNSNS), which reported the theft to the IAEA, said the material posed no risk provided it was not broken or tampered with . Officials have said the material posed no threat to the town, saying it was dangerous only in close proximity. On Monday, a federal judge ordered five people held for 40 days under a form of house arrest pending possible charges. Four of the detainees are suspected in the theft of the truck and the fifth was allegedly a possible buyer of the stolen vehicle, said an official with the Attorney General's Office, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. The farmer exposed to radiation is not a suspect in the case, authorities said.","A truckload of radioactive cobalt-60 was stolen at gunpoint a week ago .

The family of a New Mexico woman who died in 2002 when a tractor-trailer struck her car and buried it in sand, suffocating her as teachers and students at a nearby school frantically tried to dig her out, has been awarded nearly $80 million in damages. Laura Miera of Albuquerque had just dropped off her 14-year-old daughter at Jimmy Carter Middle School and was waiting at a traffic light when the semi exited Interstate 40 and came barreling toward her. The Albuquerque Redi-Mix truck pushed her car to the curb, it rolled, and Miera was trapped as the semi's open load of sand poured down on her. Family: This undated photo provided by plaintiff's attorney Vigil Law Firm shows Laura Miera and her daughter Cassandra . Counselors, teachers and students on . their way to the school tried to dig out the 48-year-old woman by hand. One counselor tried to comfort Miera as the car filled with sand. 'It was devastating,' said Jacob Vigil, the attorney who has represented Miera's family in their 10-year legal fight. 'The school counselor was holding her hand, praying while the sand just rose above her head, and the counselor just kept saying 'Squeeze my hand if you can hear me.' She squeezed for a while until she died.' According to the lawsuit, the semi involved in the crash had an expired registration, three brakes out of adjustment and a driver with two DWI charges before he was hired by Albuquerque Redi-Mix. Scene: The tractor-trailer overturned, burying the woman's car in sand and suffocating her inside, in Albuquerque . Vigil said Tuesday that the judgment offers no consolation. What he and the family hope is that their case will lead to tougher regulations and real consequences for trucking companies that are cited or fined for unsafe operations. 'This is a chronic problem across the country,' Vigil said. 'There are thousands and thousands of trucking deaths every year. It's 25, 50 tons of moving metal at highway speed. They're dangerous.' New Mexico District Judge Shannon Bacon entered the judgment Monday to Laura Miera's estate and her husband, Jose, and now-grown daughter, Cassandra. It includes $60 million in punitive damages. Freak death: On Monday, December 9, 2013, a judge awarded nearly $80 million to the family of Laura Miera who died int he freak 2002 incident, pictured . Bacon entered the judgment against Albuquerque Redi-Mix; Quintana Enterprises Inc.; the companies' owners, John and Barbara Quintana; truck driver Truman Bahe. In a response to the lawsuit, the Quintanas denied violating any state or federal regulations and said the crash and related injuries resulted from the action of others. A message seeking comment left Tuesday at Barbara Quintana's office was not immediately returned. In her order, the judge wrote that the Quintanas' conduct and that of their companies continues to endanger the public and caused Miera's 'slow and painful death.' Still mourning: Miera, pictured left, was dropping off her daughter, Cassandra, at school on that fateful 2002 day . Vigil said her death took an incredible toll on the family. Miera's husband was devastated, and her daughter, an A student, dropped out of school a few months later. 'A day doesn't go by when they don't think about this,' Vigil said. Cassandra Miera Camp, who is now married with two twin daughters and is going to college, testified last week at the trial. But Vigil said the young woman and her father aren't ready to talk publicly about the case. 'They're pretty broken up,' he said. 'They're still grieving.'","Laura Miera, 48, of Albuquerque had just dropped off her 14-year-old daughter off at school and was waiting at a traffic light when a tractor-trailer struck her car and buried it in sand .

A Montana woman on trial for the death of her new husband showed little emotion when she located his body in Glacier National Park days after she told authorities he had driven off with friends and disappeared, friends of the woman testified. Jordan Graham, 22, said after finding Cody Johnson's body that now a funeral could be held and 'the cops can be out of it,' friend Hannah Sherrill testified yesterday. Graham, her mother, brother and friends drove to the park twice in the days after Johnson, 25, went missing on July 7. Graham climbed down a steep slope to a ledge below the roadway and she called out that she spotted the body in a ravine below the cliff. Running out of allies: The teenage brother of Jordan Graham, seen leaving court on Monday, broke down on the stand today as he told how he grew frustrated with her changing stories during her husband's disappearance . 'And then after that she didn't really show any emotion,' friend Cecilia Lewellen said. Prosecutors say Graham knew where the body was located all along. They . claim she deliberately pushed Jordan from that spot during an argument . about her doubts over their eight-day-old marriage when she could have . walked away. Graham has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder, second-degree murder and making false statements to authorities. Her . defense attorneys said the two got into a heated argument that ended . when Johnson grabbed Graham's arm, she pushed back to knock his hand off . and he fell from the narrow ledge. She . lied about Jordan's disappearance at first because she was afraid . nobody would believe that it was an accident, her attorneys said. Found: Jordan led a search party to the spot in Glacier National Park where she knew Cody Johnson's body was . Graham's . brother, Michael Rutledge, testified earlier yesterday that he was . angry with Graham because she had lied again and again. 'She could have told us the truth,' Rutledge testified, sobbing. 'She . told one lie, was asked to tell the truth, and she said it again. And . she had to keep adding more lies to cover it up. And that's maybe why I . was mad.' The . testimony came on the second day of trial for Graham, as prosecutors . dissected her actions from the time her husband went missing on July 7 . until his body was found on July 11 in the national park. Using videotaped statements by Graham and text messages from her friend and her brother, prosecutors showed how her story unravelled. Rutledge testified that he was close to his sister and the 25-year-old Johnson. He said he was with Graham on July 10, when they went with their mother and two friends to a spot called The Loop to look for Johnson's body, but it was too dark to see. They returned the next day, and Rutledge told jurors he wondered why they had gone back to the same place. 'Why aren't we going to other spots? This park is huge,' Rutledge said he recalled thinking. 'But I didn't say anything because I didn't want anyone to be upset with me.' Graham said she couldn't see anything from the road, but she had a feeling, Rutledge said. The others watched as Graham climbed over a retaining wall and made her way down a treacherous rocky slope. Downward spiral: Her defense attorneys are now arguing that Graham, seen here dancing with her husband at their wedding just eight days before his death, was having post-wedding 'blues' She walked along the ledge for a while then shouted that she spotted a body in a ravine, Rutledge said. 'When Jordan claimed she saw Cody, I was in disbelief, so I went down myself,' he said. Rutledge saw the body and said he 'lost it.' He . said he climbed back up to the road and sat at the edge of the rocks . while his sister and a friend went to report the finding to park . rangers, who prosecutors said were surprised that she had been able to . find the body from that location. After Graham pointed out the body, investigators questioned her further. When shown a picture of her and Johnson at the gate of the park, she dropped her story about him going missing after leaving with friend. Close: Jordan's brother Michael said that he had grown close with her sister's husband, Cody (pictured with Jordan), during the two years that the couple dated before their wedding . Graham told them that she and Johnson had argued in the park over their eight-day-old marriage and that he accidentally fell from a cliff when she tried to remove his hand from her arm. There were no witnesses to what happened the night of July 7. Andy . Nelson, Graham's federal public defender, has said Johnson's death was a . tragic accident that occurred after she had finally worked up the nerve . to talk to Johnson about her grave doubts about their marriage. When he grabbed her during a heated argument, she pushed him to remove his hand, the lawyer said. Graham did not want to report the accident because she was afraid, and in her naivete, invented an implausible story, the lawyer said. Explain herself: Jordan, seen here at an October court appearance, will be faced with the task of explaining her bizarre behavior in the days after her husband's death when she lied to family, friends and the police . She told different slightly different . versions to people about how Johnson had left that night with friends . Graham did not know, her friend Kimberly Martinez and police said. 'I was trying to give Jordan the benefit of the doubt, but things weren't adding up for me,' Martinez said. Kalispell police Sgt. Chad Zimmerman, who interviewed Graham the day after Johnson was reported missing, also said her story did not match up with what others had told him. 'I had no way of knowing how much she was saying was true and how much not true,' Zimmerman testified. Graham returned to the Kalispell police station the next day, saying she had received an email from a person she didn't know named 'Tony' who told her that Johnson was dead and to call off the search. Another detective interviewed her about the email and Johnson's disappearance, and Graham's details of that night appeared to contradict what she had told Zimmerman the day before. The email turned out to be a fabrication, sent from an account created that day from a computer belonging to Graham's stepfather, authorities said.

He said: 'Tuesday night was a big game for them, if they'd have won it they'd have had a good chance tomorrow. 'But I have to say they were poor on Tuesday, they looked nervous and they made mistakes. 'There was a huge feeling of deflation around the DW and I think they may bring some of that here.' The pair then moved on to the story of the week: Sir Alex Ferguson's decision to step down at Old Trafford and the subsequent appointment of David Moyes.

Steve Jobs’ liver transplant surgeon is under renewed ethical scrutiny after it was revealed he lived in the billionaire’s Memphis recovery home for two years while Jobs’ attorney paid the bills. Dr. James Eason moved into Jobs’ recovery home soon after performing his surgery in 2009 and then purchased it for himself in 2011 shortly before his patient’s death. Eason has batted off questions about his relationship with Jobs before—and about how the California billionaire so quickly snagged a precious organ in Tennessee—but these new revelations have put the ethical spotlight back on the renowned transplant surgeon. Scrutiny: Dr. James Eason helped extend Steve Jobs' life by over two years with a 2009 liver transplant, but the surgeon's friendship with the billionaire is under renewed scrutiny years later . ‘It strikes me as a potential conflict of interest,’ NYU bioethicist Arthur Caplan told Memphis’s Commercial Appeal. ‘It strikes me as straining ethical credulity to have him there saying, “Well, you know, I just lived here. I was just lucky. And this guy just chose to pay my rent.""’ A call made to Eason's office was forwarded to Jeff Moder, a spokesperson for Methodist Healthcare, the hospital where Eason works. 'We don't have anything to add at this time,' was Moder's only comment on a story he said has already been covered at length. However, Moder declined to comment on behalf of Eason or the hospital as to whether the surgeon was paying rent over the course of the two years he lived in the 13-room home. Meanwhile, it seems clear that he did not personally pay the utility bills or property taxes during those years. The home was owned by a limited . liability company set up by jobs’ attorneys. The bills were paid for . personally by Jobs’ San Francisco lawyer George Riley. According . to the New York Post, Riley used his credit card to pay $8,770 in . utility bills for the home between May 2010 and 2011. Riley wrote personal checks amounting to $23,585 for property taxes on the home between 2009 and May 2011. Recovery house: This 13-room Memphis home is again at the center of debate about Eason, who has now been revealed to have lived in the home for two years while Jobs' attorney paid some of the bills . That’s when Eason purchased the home for $850,000, the same price Jobs paid in 2009. While appearing before a meeting of the Shelby County Commission for an unrelated matter, Eason was asked how he came to purchase the home. ‘It’s a fair question,’ Eason said. ‘When I learned that it was going to be going on the market, I asked the administrator of the LLC if I could purchase it.’ But his succinct answer failed to address the years he’d lived in the home before purchasing it. It also glossed over the years of bioethical intrigue that followed Jobs’ transplant. According to the Commercial Appeal, Eason was going through a divorce when he moved into the home part-time in 2009 while also trying to patch things up with his wife. 'Close friend': Following his transplant, Jobs recovered in the Memphis home. Some question Eason's relationship with Jobs--who quickly got a new liver after being listed at Eason's Tennessee hospital--now that its been revealed that Eason also lived there . Multiple listing is when a transplant patient lists his or her name at multiple hospitals. The method allows patients to be eligible for organs in areas outside the regions where they live. Hospitals tend to look at factors like bank accounts, home life, and support systems when deciding who gets precious organs. This means that mostly just wealthy individuals are able to qualify for transplant lists outside where they live. Jobs had enough money to buy a home in Memphis in which to recover and to quickly fly there when a liver became available. 'And then, in 2010, sometime in spring of 2010, I moved in there and stayed there until I purchased the house. And live there now,' Eason said. While most Americans waiting for transplants do so near their homes and families, those patients with more money and mobility are able to cast a far greater net when searching for an organ. The process is called multiple listing and it gives patients—who are rich more often than not—a greatly increased chance to get a life-saving transplant. Because he had the means to travel and be taken care of outside of his California residence, hospitals outside his place of residence were willing to place him on their transplant lists. While Jobs may have died waiting for a liver in densely populated California, where many were ahead of him on the transplant list, he quickly made it to the front of the line in less populous Tennessee. Eason has addressed Jobs’ luck in the past. ‘He was the top person on that list that day, because he was the sickest person on the list that day,’ Eason said in a statement shortly after news of Jobs’ transplant emerged in 2009. While ethicists and sick patients without Jobs’ money may question the fairness of multiple listing, it is legal. And other patients of Dr. Eason’s might question his relationship with Jobs. According to the Commercial Appeal, the doctor went above and beyond the typical level of care offered to most patients: coordinating his recovery and continued cancer tests, pain treatment, and nutrition. Eason even reportedly ran errands for Jobs and took him on walks in the park. While such intimacy has lent itself to questions about possible preferential treatment given to the billionaire, for his part Eason says they were just friends. ‘We developed a close friendship. And we treated each other like you would do any other friend,’ Eason told the Commercial Appeal. ‘He was a friend helping me out. And I was, you know, looking after the house for him.’","Dr. James Eason has been questioned about the ethics involved in securing the California billionaire a liver in Tennessee .

Nearly two years after elderly couple were murdered execution style inside their palatial home, Massachusetts authorities are renewing their appeal to the public for help in finding the culprit. Real estate developer John ‘Jack’ Magee, 69, and his 67-year-old wife, Geraldine ‘Jeri’ Magee, were found murdered in their Andover home by their daughter December 14, 2011. The couple’s Lexus SUV was found torched the previous night in Boston, about 20 miles away. Mystery murders: It has been almost two years since the bodies of real estate developer John Magee, 69, and Geraldine Magee, 67, were found by their daughter in Andover, Massachusetts . On Tuesday, as the two-year anniversary of the couple’s death approaches, Essex District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett and Andover Police Chief Patrick Keefe said they are still actively investigating the killings. They urged anyone with possible information to contact Massachusetts state police detectives assigned to Blodgett’s office. Jeff Greene, Mrs Magee's nephew, told The Eagle Tribune that the family are still searching for answers and are desperate for closure. He added that detectives working the case have been giving the relatives regular updates on the investigation, but so far there have been no suspects or new leads. 'The investigation remains active and a high priority,' Blodgett said in a statement. 'We will continue to pursue every lead until we find the person or persons responsible for this tragic murder and seek justice for the Magee family in court.' Friends of the Magees said after the double homicide that the couple had no enemies and lived a 'charmed life' in Andover - an area known for organized crime. Their daughter, Holly Magee Senykoff, . was leaving her two children to be watched by her parents as she did . every week when she found their bodies at 9.30am December 14, 2011. John and Geraldine had been shot in the neck, their bodies positioned head-to-head and all shell casings removed from the scene off the crime, suggesting that it may have been a mob execution. Authorities are remaining tight-lipped about the circumstances of . the slayings and provided no public updates on the progress of the . investigation. Crime scene: The victims were found lying head-to-head with gunshot wounds to the neck inside their sprawling $1.25million mansion . Though they did not identify any . suspects or established any motive, police reassured residents it was an isolated killing. John and Geraldine Magee met as . teenagers at Arlington High School and went on to have a long and happy . marriage spanning four decades and resulting in two children, daughter Holly and son John Magee III, who has continued his father's thriving construction business. Their sprawling 5,500-square-foot home at 7 Orchard Crossing, which they built themselves, was put up for sale in June of this year for $1.25million. The price has since dropped to $999,999.","Bodies of John and Geraldine Magee were found December 14, 2011, head-to-head and shot in neck with shell casings missing .

After viewing the horrific video which shows cows hanging from ropes and blistered with seeping sores, Foremost Farms USA declared themselves to be 'extremely disappointed.' 'To protect consumer trust and confidence in the dairy industry, we have discontinued receiving milk from the farm depicted in the video.' Horrible: This cow is bleeding heavily from an open wound and is not being treated by any employee at Wiese Brothers in Wisconsin . Grim: Another cow is hoisted into the air while at Griese Brothers and frantically runs its legs to try and escape . Faced with a public relations disaster, the Wiese family said that they were 'shocked and saddened' at the footage and added they have 'zero tolerance for animal abuse.' They confirmed that the two employees seen in the video had been fired and a third removed from 'animal handling' responsibilities. 'Further action will be taken if the investigation warrants it,' said the statement. The local sheriff's department in Greenleaf said that they are investigating the alleged abuse and will be pressing charges if warranted. The video was shot undercover by a representative of the animal rights group Mercy for Animals in October and November and was then handed over to NBC News. Cruel: This cow is hanging in the air as a forklift truck operated by an employee reverses backwards . Poked pulled and prodded: This cow looks distressed as it is pulled by its head upwards by a tractor . 'No socially responsible corporation should support dairy operations that beat, kick, mutilate and neglect animals,' said MFA’s executive director, Nathan Runkle. 'Due to its complete lack of meaningful animal welfare standards, DiGiorno has allowed a culture of cruelty to flourish in its cheese supply chain.' The gruesome video reveals repeated examples of cruelty towards the livestock at Wiese Brothers farm as bleeding animals are beaten with sticks or kicked and dragged by their legs or necks. Speaking to NBC News, one livestock expert said the video showed unequivocal evidence of abuse. 'Dragging live cows, and completely suspending them with the cow lift is severe animal abuse,' said Temple Grandin, an associate professor of livestock behavior at Colorado State University and an animal welfare adviser to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Reality: This calf has been separated from its mother and could possibly be killed for veal at Wiese Brothers in Wisconsin . 'The actions of these people went beyond rough handling and escalated to the level of cruelty. Kicking, beating, and hard whipping of downed cows is abusive.' Brown County Shefiff's Department said they were in the midst of an investigation after being handed the footage. 'It something we’re looking into right now,' said Captain David Konrath. 'At the conclusion of the investigation we’ll give the case to the district attorney and he will make a decision about whether charges would be filed.' Pizza and the farm: DiGiorno is the most popular brand of pizza in the United States and the milk its cheese suppliers use comes from Wiese Brothers . A Wiese family spokesperson said that they were working fully with Brown County Sheriff's Department and had invited an 'independent animal care auditor from a national evaluation firm' to come to their facility and begin a review of practices within 24 hours of being made aware of the footage in on November 26. 'We are shocked and saddened to see a few of our employees not following our farm's policies for proper animal care. We have zero tolerance for animal abuse. We are committed to providing optimal care and ask all our employees to demonstrate ongoing respect for every animal at all times,' the farm said. The farm, which has 4,500 cows that produce about 350,000 pounds of milk daily, was chosen at random to investigate.","Shocking video shows Wisconsin based Wiese Brothers Farms employees viciously kicking, beating, stabbing and violently whipping cows in the face and body .

A disabled Walmart customer claims he has been banned for life for trying to get the retail giant to honor its price-matching policy. Joe Cantrell, 49, of Queen Creek, Arizona, shops at Walmart because he is disabled and unable to earn a living. When he tried to save a few more bucks by matching prices, he was handcuffed and banned from ever returning to another Walmart store for the rest of his life, he says. But, Walmart says the that Mr Cantrell became aggressive while arguing for the price match and that the manager he was speaking to felt threatened. The employee called the police because he feared for his safety, the company says. Loyal shopper: Joe Cantrell used to shop twice a day at Walmart . Mr Cantrell currently faces charges of threatening, intimidation and disorderly conduct. Mr . Cantrell was banned during a recent stop at the Sun Tan Valley Walmart . while trying to buy ornaments for his family’s Christmas tree, he told ABC 15. ‘I was handcuffed, humiliated and embarrassed in front of everybody at Walmart,’ the loyal shopper recalled. The former professional wrestler told the station he used to visit Walmart twice a day. ‘I just love Walmart and that's why I go,’ he added, before pausing to gather himself and apologizing.‘Sorry I get a little emotional about this, because I'm disabled.’ Mr Cantrell sustained a number of serious injuries in the ring that prohibit him from being able to make any significant income, ad matching was just another way to stretch his precious pennies even further. Banned: This is the notice Mr Cantrell received telling him he is banned from all Walmart stores worldwide . Charged: The price matching guru now faces criminal charges for trying to save a few dollars . Walmart employees told him price matching wasn’t allowed in the store, soon the police arrived. ‘When I left, he turned around and called the Pinal County Sheriff's Office and said he felt intimidated and threatened,’ he explained. ‘I was upset, but never once did I say anything to the gentleman.’ A return visit three days later resulted in the penny pincher being handed a court summons and a notice from Walmart headquarters banning him from any location worldwide – all while he was in handcuffs. Devastated: The disabled former pro wrestler is not allowed back to his favorite store . ‘I felt shamed,’ he recalled. ‘I felt like I was the bad guy, and I know I'm not a bad guy.’ The cops eventually set him loose, he was so relieved he cried over the thought of going back home to his family. Walmart's price matching policy, which is posted online, allows customers to bring in any circular from any competing store . 'If you find a lower advertised price on an identical product, tell us and we’ll match it,' the website brags. A message left by MailOnline seeking comment from Walmart was not returned. The most loyal shopper Walmart likely ever had now faces charges of disorderly conduct, intimidation and threatening – for which he cannot afford a lawyer. Not honored: The chain ousted Mr Cantrell for trying to get them to stick to this guarantee .","Joe Cantrell used to shop twice a day at his favorite Arizona Walmart .

"By . Ap Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:18 EST, 10 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:18 EST, 10 December 2013 . Relatives of a recently deceased 66-year-old woman have discovered the skeletal remains of two infants in a footlocker while cleaning out her mobile home in northeast Ohio, police have confirmed. A man contacted investigators after he and a cousin found the remains on Monday in the locked container while cleaning out his mother's mobile home in North Canton, about 45 miles southeast of Cleveland. Among the remains were a partial skull that witnesses say 'could fit in the palm of your hand'. The woman died in on November 28, police said. The remains of two infants, including a partial skull 'that could fit in the palm of your hand', have been found inside this trunk. The discovery was made by the son of a recently-deceased 66-year-old who was cleaning out his mother's mobile home in North Canton, Ohio . It's not clear how old the remains are, but it doesn't appear the children died recently, North Canton police Chief Stephan Wilder said. Maitenance man Doug Lindower, who was working in the park on N. Main St at the time of the discovery, said he was there when the woman's son opened the blue trunk. 'I just ain't never seen anything like that in my life,' the maintenance worker told Canton Rep. Lindower said the man was 'distraught' at the finding. The remains were in a plastic bag that was in the worn, light blue locker with a small blanket and other items, Wilder said. He said the bag also appeared to contain some sort of cloth that had deteriorated. 'It's a sad case to have to investigate,' Wilder said. The gruesome discovery was made in this mobile home park on North Canton, Ohio, on Monday. Authorities say it could take several weeks to receive the results of a forensic and DNA analysis of the remains . Investigators searched the home but found nothing else noteworthy. The Stark County coroner's office confirmed the remains were those of two infants, and the office plans to have them examined by anthropologists at Mercyhurst University in Erie, Pa. That examination and a DNA analysis could help address lingering questions, including the ages and gender of the children, but it's not clear if there is enough evidence to determine what happened to them, Wilder said. The woman lived in North Canton for the past five years after moving from Louisville, and Wilder said police are not yet sure how long the remains were in the trunk or whether the woman had any knowledge of its contents. Her son, who lives in California, has cooperated with investigators, the chief said. 'I think he was, you know, alarmed or shocked by what he found in his mother's belongings,' Wilder said. Police are reaching out to other relatives in hopes of learning more about the remains.","The son of a 66-year-old woman who died in late November found the bones locked in a footlocker while cleaning out his mother's mobile home in North Canton, Ohio .

"By . Helen Pow and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 18:10 EST, 10 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 21:09 EST, 10 December 2013 . Death sentence: Ronald Clinton Lott, pictured, is scheduled to be executed on Tuesday, December 10, 2013 for brutally killing two elderly women more than a quarter-century ago . An Oklahoma man convicted of raping and murdering two elderly women in the 1980s was executed Tuesday night, after a last meal of fish, fries and hush puppies with tartar sauce and ketchup from Long John Silver's. Ronald Clinton Lott, 53, made no final statement before he received a lethal injection at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester. Lott, the fifth Oklahoma death row inmate to be executed this year, was pronounced dead at 6:06 p.m., officials confirmed. As the curtains opened, Lott looked over at his brother, who raised his fist and nodded. Lott made no final statement. He again looked at his brother in the first row of the viewing room as the drugs were pumped into his body, then Lott's eyes closed. He started breathing heavily and gasped for air three times. Following the pronouncement of death, corrections workers tried to close the curtains, but one wouldn't despite repeated attempts. They ended up hanging a white sheet over the window. An Oklahoma County jury convicted Lott of two counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of Anna Laura Fowler, 83, in September 1986 and Zelma Cutler, 93, in January 1987. He was also convicted of raping the women. State and federal courts denied Lott's appeals. No members of the victims' families were in attendance, but an attorney for Lott was. Fowler lived alone in Oklahoma City when Lott broke into her home through the back screen door and attacked her on September 2, 1986. Authorities said Fowler was raped and a knotted cloth was used to bind her hands. She had multiple injuries, including rib fractures and bruising on her wrists, hands, eyes, lips and cheeks. She died from asphyxiation, and her grandson found her dead on her bed the next morning. Cutler's home was across the street from Fowler and she also lived alone. Police found her dead on her bed on January 11, 1987. The electricity to Cutler's home had been shut off at the breaker box and the phone wire had been cut. She had been raped and had multiple rib fractures and bruising. Prison: Lott made no final statement before he received a lethal injection at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester, pictured . In November, the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board voted 4-1 to deny commuting Lott's death sentence to life in prison. At the clemency hearing, Lott apologized to the victims' families and asked for their forgiveness. 'I'm so sorry for what I've done. And I'd ask them to forgive me,' Lott told board members, victims' family members and others during a teleconference from the Oklahoma State Penitentiary at McAlester. 'I caused them so much hurt and pain.' Lott initially told members of the Pardon and Parole Board that he wanted to waive his clemency hearing, but made a statement after his attorney pleaded with him to do so. He refused to ask the board to spare his life, though, despite his attorney's pleas. Jim Fowler, the son of Anna Fowler, urged the board to spare Lott's life 'and let him rot in that damn cell.' Another man, Robert Lee Miller Jr., originally was convicted of the heinous crimes after he confessed to police in 1987. Miller spent 11 years in prison before DNA evidence finally linked Lott to the slayings. Miller was released in 1998 after seven years on death row. Lott has been on death row since 2001. Stay: Missouri death row inmate Allen Nicklasson, pictured in 2011, has had his execution stayed a little more than a day before he was set to die for killing businessman Richard Drummond in 1994 . Murder: Nicklasson, pictured left in 2008, was convicted of killing a man who stopped on a highway to help him and two other men whose car had broken down . In January, the U.S. 10th Circuit . Court of Appeals in Denver rejected Lott's appeal. He claimed he . received ineffective counsel during the sentencing phase of the trial. He also argued there was prosecutorial misconduct and insufficient . evidence in his case. The execution in Oklahoma comes after a federal appeals court panel stayed a Missouri execution planned for hours later. Missouri . appealed the 2-1 ruling by the Eighth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals . panel to stay the execution of Allen Nicklasson, 41, who was found . guilty of killing a stranger who offered him roadside assistance. Nicklasson has raised claims that his trial and appeals counsel were . ineffective. Nicklasson's execution was set for 12.01 a.m. Wednesday at a Missouri prison. In the Missouri case, Nicklasson was found guilty of murder for the August 1994 shooting of motorist Richard Drummond, who stopped on a highway to help Nicklasson and two other men whose car had broken down. The men had burglarized a home where they stole guns and ammunition before their vehicle broke down. When Drummond stopped to offer a ride, the men abducted him, took him to a wooded area and shot him in the head, according to court records. One of the men, Dennis Skillicorn, was executed in 2009. The other man, Tim DeGraffenreid, was 17 at the time. He pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and received a reduced sentence. Nicklasson and Skillicorn were also convicted of killing an Arizona couple while they were on the run after killing Drummond. Nicklasson would be the second person executed in Missouri this year.","Ronald Clinton Lott, 53, received a lethal injection at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester and was pronounced dead at 6.06 p.m. Tuesday .

Jailed: Wayne Langley, 29, used a pitchfork to attack the husband of a woman he had an affair with. He was found guilty of affray and jailed for two years . Tending manicured lawns and meticulously kept borders on behalf of customers in a genteel market town, they should have been at one with nature. But simmering just below the surface for two rival gardening firms was a tangle of deceit and hatred that would explode in the most spectacular fashion. An affair between one gardener and the wife of his business rival triggered a two-year turf war that erupted into a violent street battle... with the tools of their trade redeployed as weapons. Elderly residents watched in horror as shovels, pitchforks and a claw hammer were wielded with a vengeance. Horticulturalist Ben Smith, who had been cuckolded by Wayne Langley, had his teeth knocked out, while his brother Keith Smith was stabbed and hit with a hammer. A court heard that when police investigated what lay behind the feud, they were told by a relative of Langley: ‘It is all to do with my nephew sh****** that bloke’s wife.’ A jury at Preston Crown Court heard that Ben Smith, 45, had found out about 29-year-old Langley’s affair with his wife and the bad blood between the pair developed into the turf war between the businesses in Poulton-le-Fylde, Lancashire. The brutal climax came on April 3 when Langley and colleagues were selling garden fertiliser door-to-door and found Mr Smith and his brother spreading compost on a front garden. Convicted: Langley's cousin Samuel Pollitt, 27, leaving Preston Crown Court where he was also found guilty of affray.

There was bad blood, resulting in a feud.’ Attack: Ben Smith, 48, and his brother Keith, 53, were laying compost at 10am on April 3 when Langley arrived with his family, enraged that they had beaten him to a customer on the Lancashire street . Wounded: The fight left Ben Smith with fractured eye sockets and missing teeth. His brother Keith was speared in the head . He said a massive fracas erupted with both parties arming themselves with tools from their vans. He . said: ‘Keith Smith saw Langley approaching Ben with the pitchfork and . then threw the spade at him. Despite being unarmed Keith ran towards .

Andrew swung the hammer at Keith’s head striking him. ‘Andrew Pollitt then hit Ben over the head – and the victim remembers nothing else. A number of Ben’s teeth were knocked out.’ Stunned . residents said they saw Mr Smith spitting out his own teeth and being . stamped upon.

Lean' diet has picked up a host of celebrity fans, from supermodels Elle Macpherson and . David Gandy, to actor Hugh Grant and Victoria's Secret model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. And now fitness guru-to-the-stars James Duigan has updated and re-released . his healthy living plan for everyone on Kindle this month, promising to banish yo-yo dieting forever and give . you the streamline body of which you've always dreamed. And for Femail readers, Duigan has filmed a series of . exclusive exercise videos, each targeting a specific problem area, just for us. Last week Duigan revealed how to get the bottom you really want, and this . week tummies are under the spotlight. Scroll down for exclusive video . British model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is a staunch supporter of James Duigan's Clean & Lean diet plan . In today's short video, Duigan reveals three exercises which he promises will give you a flat tummy. The wood chop is one of his favourite exercises, a 'big bang' exercise that uses pretty much every muscle in your body. It involves swiping your clenched hands in outstretched arms from left to right, down to up. The plank helps improve posture and strengthen core muscles by working and switching on abdominals. The tummy vacuum is 'a great way of connecting your brain to your tummy muscles', by teaching them to work properly. It helps you engage muscles in the stomach properly. The three exercises are easy-to-do and can be carried out anywhere at any time. And although . it's loved by supermodels, Victoria's Secret girls and film stars, Duigan says that the real magic is . that is can work for anyone, from housewives to office workers and . everyone in between. Huntington-Whiteley . met James several years ago and is such a fan that she penned the . introduction to his book Clean & Lean: Flat Tummy Fast. Rosie said: 'James knows exactly how I want my body to look: lean, taut and strong, yet soft, curvy and feminine. 'What . I've learned through working with James is that by focusing on creating . a healthy body you can really achieve all of these things, faster than I . ever thought possible. Oh, and by the way, nobody can get a stomach as . flat as James can!' Rosie said: 'James knows exactly how I want my body to look: lean, taut and strong, yet soft, curvy and feminine' Common sense: James Duigan's Clean & Lean plan is loved by supermodels and anyone who wants to detox and tone up . The . diet has never been advertised, but those who follow it (and who follow . Duigan's workouts, which he teaches from his London gym Bodyism, . recently voted as best in the business by Tatler) become enthusiastic to the point of . fanaticism, making the Clean & Lean plan popular through word of . mouth alone. It recommends fresh food, as close to . its natural state as possible. No refined sugar, which Duigan describes as like a 'toxic fat . bomb' for your waistline. Cut back caffeine to one cup of coffee in the . morning. Rely on . natural, nutritious foods to give you energy rather than a roller coaster . of unnatural highs provided by sugar and caffeine that invariably end . in a crash that will have you reaching for the next stimulant, whether . that be coffee, carbs, sweets or wine. And yes, ditch the booze. Fans: Left, supermodel Rosie Huntington-Whiteley . has been following the Clean & Lean plan for some years now, while . right, British model David Gandy is also a fan . In . his new book, Duigan explains that he came up with the term 'clean and . lean' to describe the 'ultimate approach to achieving the perfect body. The word 'clean' here means a body that can deal  effectively with . toxins - one that can deal with few that sneak in (via a glass of wine . or a chocolate bar) and flush them out successfully.' In . his years of studying nutrition, says Duigan, he has discovered that . while you can live off processed low-fat food and diet colas for a while . your body will be so toxic that you'll find it hard to keep the weight . off. 'People come to me . who have tried every single diet out there, yet they can't stay slim . for long.

The relentless, low-level stress of everyday life can also add inches to your waist. When we're frightened, angry, tense or worried our bodies become flooded with adrenalin and a stress hormone called cortisol. The adrenalin keeps us alert and focused, while the cortisol prepares our muscles for a 'fight-or-flight' response. Does stress leave you feeling fat? It also helps the body to release sugar into the bloodstream for instant energy. It's all part of a defence mechanism that allows the body to respond appropriately when faced with danger. While this stress mechanism worked well for us when we were cavemen, modern-day stress, caused by a relentlessly busy lifestyle, is really bad for you. It makes you fat, it wears out your immune system and it increases your risk of serious illness. This is because many of the situations that cause stress nowadays don't present the sort of physical danger that you need to run away from. The result is that fat-storing hormones - and the sugar they help to release into the bloodstream - float around your system, eventually ending up as fat on your tummy and around your waist. They also make you crave more sugar because your body thinks it needs more to keep going. As stress levels subside, your adrenalin levels fall, but cortisol (and the resulting blood sugar) stays in the system much longer. Research shows that fat cells around the stomach attract cortisol, giving you a layer of toxic fat just below your abdominal muscles that's really hard to shift, so doing regular sit-ups is pointless if you always feel stressed. And stomach fat is the most dangerous type because it raises your risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and certain cancers. Constant stress also shuts down the digestive system because your body redirects blood from there to your muscles. So stress can leave you constipated, bloated and toxic. Beating stress is the only way to better health and a better body. From The Clean & Lean Diet by James Duigan .","Australian health warrior James Duigan promotes strong, lean body shape .

Shooting: Daniel Taylor, 18, of Tempe, Arizona was charged with first degree murder in the random shooting death of former Bangor man, Jeff Ward, on Sunday, Dec. 8, 2013 . A teenager twice booted out of a Christmas party in Arizona on Sunday returned a third time dressed in camouflage and wearing a clown mask to indiscriminately fire on revelers - killing one man and injuring a woman. Daniel Taylor, 18, who lives in the same Tempe apartment block where the party was being held, fatally shot Jeff Ward, 28, in the neck and was arrested after a three-hour stand-off with SWAT teams in the early hours of Sunday morning. Taylor, who is unemployed and lives with his mother at 850 S. River Drive, was known to walk around the apartment complex brandishing the handgun he used to kill Ward on his hip and has been charged with first-degree murder and aggravated assault. Tempe Police Sgt. Michael Pooley said . that Taylor initially seemed to invite himself to the party but was . asked to leave when he was told he wasn't invited. He . came back an hour later dressed in a suit but again was asked to leave but then returned for a third time armed with his handgun and dressed in . combat gear, wearing his clown mask. 'He was not invited, but he thought he could just come in anyway,' the sergeant said to Bangor Daily News. 'They asked him to leave. He came back about an hour later, this time he was wearing a suit coat, slacks and a nice shirt. Scroll Down for Video . Stand-off: Daniel Taylor was arrested after a three-hour stand-off between him and Tempe SWAT officers after he refused to leave his apartment complex . The change of clothes seemed to confuse the partygoers but when he was recognized he was told to go. 'He came back about 20 minutes later back in camouflage and had a gun,' the sergeant said. According to court documents, Taylor returned wearing a clown mask, and was spotted hiding in bushes near the apartment, before approaching the patio and shooting indiscriminately at people. Bursting into the party at around 2 am, Taylor, 'reached into the patio area and just started firing rounds, six to eight rounds,' Pooley said. 'Unfortunately, one of those did strike Jeff Ward in the neck' and killed him. He also struck and wounded a woman, whose name and age and where she was hit have not been released as of Tuesday. After frantic 911 calls, police SWAT teams responded and initially, Taylor refused to leave the complex. Deadly: Taylor allegedly shot Jeff Ward, 28, dead and another unidentified woman in the early hours of Sunday . The standoff lasted 3 hours before Taylor surrendered to police. According to court documents, the clown mask was found inside Taylor's apartment and they also recovered a .22 caliber handgun, along with ammunition. Ward is the son of Jim and Debbie Ward of Bangor and also is survived by a sister, Kelly Ward, of Bangor, according to family friend Elizabeth Wilson who spoke to the Bangor Daily News. Jeff Ward was a 2004 Bangor High School graduate and was living and working in Tempe, Wilson said. 'He comes from one of the most loving and giving families I’ve ever known and this loss has fallen heavy on all of their hearts,' said Wilson, a Houlton native living in Portland. 'I reached out to his friends from Bangor, on behalf of his mother, to tell them of his passing. The overall response was shock.' Ward was a former student at Arizona State University, Sgt. Pooley said as he revealed that Taylor's bond has been set at $450,000.","Daniel Taylor, 18, has been charged with first-degree murder after allegedly shooting a man dead at a Christmas party in Tempe, Arizona .

An actress pleaded guilty today to sending ricin-laced letters to President Barack Obama and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg after telling the FBI her husband was responsible. Shannon Guess Richardson, a mother-of-six who has had minor roles in 'The Walking Dead' and 'The Blind Side', entered the plea in Texarkana, Texas in a bid to her cap prison time at 18 years. Richardson, 35, was arrested in June after . authorities said she tried to implicate her then husband, Nathan . Richardson, after he had filed for divorce. Prosecutors claimed Shannon Richardson . mailed three letters from New Boston, outside Texarkana, then went to . police and claimed that her husband had done it. Plea: Shannon Richardson, pictured after a court appearance arrest in June, has pleaded guilty to sending ricin letters to President Obama and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and blaming it on her husband . She told investigators she found a suspicious substance in their refrigerator as well as addresses for Bloomberg and Obama written on a note on his desk. The . letter that was sent to Obama, according to a federal indictment, said: 'What's in . this letter is nothing compared to what ive got in store for you mr . president.' But prosecutors said investigators noted inconsistencies in Richardson's statements and later learned that she had purchased materials online to produce ricin, a toxin that can cause respiratory failure if inhaled. She was charged with one count of possessing and producing a biological toxin. Poses: Her husband said Shannon, who had had minor roles in TV shoes, had always wanted to be famous . Blamed: After sending the ricin letters to Obama and Bloomberg, she allegedly called the FBI and said that she had found notes written by her husband Nathaniel (right) to the president . Her attorney, Tonda Curry, said last month that she and prosecutors agreed to a deal capping Richardson's sentence at 18 years. Prosecutors say Richardson faces life in prison for the charge to which she pleaded guilty. A federal judge ultimately will sentence Richardson at a later sentencing hearing, which has not yet been scheduled. 'Shannon is anxious to admit her role in ordering the components to make the ricin, her role in the letters that contained the ricin, and to tell the government who else was involved in those offenses,' Curry said. Curry did not say more about Richardson's possible motives or whom she might name. While in custody earlier this year, . she gave birth to her sixth child, who is now in the custody of her . ex-husband. Attorney John Delk said that the baby weighed less than two . pounds when it was born. Probe: Investigators can be seen outside the couple's home in New Boston, Texas in June . Locked up: Richardson's lawyer said the plea deal is expected to cap her sentence at 18 years . Richardson already has five children from previous relationships, age 4 to 19. Her husband Mr Richardson, an army veteran, has said she was desperate to become famous. 'She really wanted to be an actress,' he told ABC News in an interview in June. 'She wanted to get her face out there.' Ricin, a highly toxic substance, is found naturally in castor beans, but it takes a deliberate act to manufacture it and use it to poison people, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Exposure to even a small amount of ricin can cause death and no known antidote exists.","Shannon Guess Richardson 'sent President Obama and Mayor Bloomberg ricin-laced letters telling them to keep away from gun restrictions'

He loved his family and he loved life’. New dad Jim Vester, 32, was lured to an Indianapolis parking lot on Wednesday by two men who posted an advert on Craigslist, saying they had an iPad for sale. But when he arrived he was ambushed, gunned down and robbed. Brothers Tyron Kincade, 19, and Tyshaune Kincade, 18, were today charged with his murder. Grief: Jim Vester was killed while trying to buy an iPad for his parents, Janice and Walter. Mrs Vester told MailOnline: I don¿t want to speak about those people, I just want to talk about Jim and his life . Wonderful: Mrs Vester said: 'He loved life, he loved his family, he loved his son and he loved his wife' It has since been revealed that the men are suspects in four other similar robberies, where they lured victims with Craigslist posts and then took their valuables at gun point. Indiana National Guardsman and Iraq war veteran, Mr Vester, 32, leaves behind wife Jamie and one-year-old son Gavin. And his devastated mother Janice today spoke to MailOnline to pay tribute to her beloved son. Mr Vester was trying to buy his mother and father Walter the iPad for Christmas when he was shot. Speaking through floods of tears, Mrs Vester said: ‘He was a wonderful father and a wonderful son. It was his funeral yesterday and about 1,000 people came to the calling and said wonderful things about him. ‘He loved to entertain and to help his family out. He would do anything for us. He was incredibly generous. ‘The detective on the case has kept us well informed, but I don’t want to speak about those people, I just want to talk about Jim and his life. ‘I want to speak about what a great guy he was. He loved life, he loved his family, he loved his son and he loved his wife. ‘All the military people we have spoken to have told us that he was the one who kept them in line, that they could count on Jim for everything. ‘He hadn’t always wanted to be a soldier, but the military was very good for him, it was perfect for him.

Tyshaune Kincade’s cell number allegedly links to all four crimes and police are now looking to file further charges against the brothers . Since the terrible tragedy on Wednesday, details of the case have started to emerge. A police report states Mr Vester arranged to meet someone who had advertised an iPad for sale on Craigslist at around 3.30pm in a car lot outside an apartment complex on Wyckford Drive, Indianapolis. After exchanging texts with the seller, he was confronted by two men in their teens or early 20s. Witnesses say they overheard Mr Vester introduce himself as ‘Jim’ and moments later another man said, ‘This is a robbery’. The second attacker was then heard, saying, ‘God damn’. Soon after there were two gunshots. The two men were seen running away from the scene by another set of witnesses and Mr Vester staggered back to his car, before collapsing. He had been shot in the chest. Police spoke to a friend of Mr Vester soon after his murder and he said the soldier was fully aware the area he was going to could be dangerous and had actually asked others to go with him. Tragically no one was able to make the trip. The Kincade brothers were arrested in connection with the murder and robbery on Friday. They appeared in court on Tuesday and an automatic not guilty plea was entered on their behalf. Police have revealed that investigators recovered a cell phone matching the number Vester contacted when answering the Craigslist ad. Scene: This is the parking lot where Jim Vester was shot dead on Wednesday while attempting to buy an iPad . The phone was inside a vehicle Tyshaune Kincade was driving when he was stopped by police. That same number was also stored inside Kincade’s mother’s cell phone with a photo of her son assigned to the contact. During their search of the Kincade’s home, the teens’ mother also showed detectives where she kept her handgun. She said it was missing and the only people able to access it were her sons. It has also come to light that there have been at least four other robberies in the area, where the victims have been led into a trap by a fake Craigslist posting, before being robbed of cash and mobile phones at gun point. Tyshaune Kincade’s cell number apparently links to all four crimes and police are now looking to file further charges against the brothers.

A 14-year-old girl from Arizona who went missing last Thursday was discovered dead in a Dumpster the following day, and police are now saying that foul play was involved. Two women digging through the trash container for aluminum cans at the Sun Garden Apartments in Mesa early Friday morning discovered the body of Claudia Ann Lucero, police announced yesterday. A resident of the complex told Phoenix TV station KPHO that she heard shouting about 11.30pm Thursday. Scroll down for video . Brief life: Claudia Ann Lucero, 14, a high school freshman from Mesa, Arizona, was found dead in a Dumpster just two hours after being reported missing . Shocking discovery: Two women rifling through the contents of this Dumpster on Brown Road came across a dead body, which was later identified as the missing 14-year-old . Shortly after that, two distraught people ran upstairs and knocked on her door asking to use her phone to call police because they said there was a body in a trash container, the unidentified woman said. ‘Homicide detectives responded to the scene and began their investigation into this obviously suspicious death,’ said Sgt. Tony Landato, a police spokesman. Landato said the teen was last seen at about 6.30am Thursday at her Mesa home. The girl's mother reported her as a possible runaway at 10pm that day, and her body turned up in the trash about two hours later. Last night, some 100 friends and neighbors gathered outside the housing complex on East Brown Road for an emotional candlelight vigil to remember a girl who was described as popular and chatty. Bursting with life: Friends and family said Claudia was talkative, friendly, loved hop hop music, fashion and makeup . Memorial: More than 100 people gathered near the spot where Lucero's body was found, leaving behind flowers, candles and toys . Claudia was a freshman at Westwood High School, where her classmates said she excelled in her studies, was friendly to everyone and loved making people laugh. The raven-haired 14-year-old loved hip hop music, swimming and had many friends, according to her grief-stricken aunt Margaret Lucero, AZCentral reported. 'She used to sit right next to me in one of my classes,' classmate Jose Fuentes told MyFox Phoenix. 'Counselors came in, told us she had passed... I was in shock, couldn't really believe it. Honestly, I just got this feeling in my stomach, like it hurts.' Lupe Lucero, a cousin, said the bubbly teen was interested in fashion and makeup. The girl is survived by her three brothers. Her older sibling, Ricky Lucero, wrote an impassioned eulogy on his Facebook account Monday night, expressing his love for his slain baby sister. 'Why did you have to go lil sis,' Mr Lucero wrote in all caps. 'Wish you could had told [sic] me if there was something wrong or it someone was stalking you or talking dirty... I would have took [sic] care of the problem.' Protective: Ricky Lucero (left), Claudia's older brother, wrote on his Facebook page he wished his sister came to him if someone had been stalking or disrespecting her . Police are not saying how Claudia Lucero die, or whether her murder was preceded by a sexual assault. A makeshift memorial has since sprung up outside the apartment complex on Brown Road, with mourners leaving roses, toys and candles in the teen's memory. The victim’s family have made a public plea asking any witnesses to the crime to come forward. 'That's my sister. For them to throw her in the trash like that just tells me my sister was trash, and she wasn't trash,' Ricky Lucero told the station WAVE3. 'She wasn't trash at all.'

Abandoned babies can be left in a controversial 'baby hatch' at a German hospital where newborns are looked after and put up for adoption. The heated box, lined with a pillow and blankets, is at Berlin's St Joseph hospital. Mothers can leave their unwanted children anonymously at the 'Babyklappe', or baby hatch, and statistics show it is used about twice a year. Abandoned: A baby hatch at Berlin's St. Joseph hospital in Germany. A baby hatch is a place where people can bring babies, usually newborn ones, and leave them there anonymously to be found and cared for . Alarm: he stainless-steel hatch slides out and after a person has placed their baby inside and slid it shut, it triggers an alarm inside the hospital so staff can pick the child up . Hatch: The practice was common in medieval times but has come under fire from the UN recently . The stainless-steel hatch slides out and after a person has placed their baby inside and slid it shut, it triggers an alarm inside the hospital so staff can pick the child up. It takes about two or three minutes for staff to get to the hatch so the parent has enough time to slip away unseen. Inside the box is a letter which tells the mother German authorities will look after the baby for eight weeks. The system can be like a . 'revolving door' as mums that change their mind can come back to reclaim . their babies within two months. However, if the parent does not come back to be reunited with their child after the two months it will be put up for adoption. The practice was common in medieval times but has come under fire from the UN recently. The BBC reports it believes that children have a right to know who their parents are and that right is denied to children left in the baby hatch. There is also fears that, because of the anonymity of the system, fathers of children or other relatives could hand the baby over instead of mothers. The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child says there are baby boxes across Europe but Germany has the most with 99 across the country.

A Los Angeles man who is alleged to have made prank calls to prominent professional sports coaches, offering them jobs, has been arrested. Kenneth Tarr, 32, was arrested yesterday at his home in Hollywood and booked on suspicion of felony eavesdropping. The charge involves recording phone conversations without the consent of the people on the calls, police spokeswoman Sally Madera said. Kenneth Tarr, 32, from Hollywood, who is alleged to have made prank calls about job vacancies for prominent professional coaches, has been arrested . Tarr was being held on $20,000 bail, LA County jail records showed. Madera would give no further details or identify the victims, saying only that Tarr pretended to be somebody else on the calls. But LAPD Lt Mark Reina told NBC news, which first reported the arrest, that the two-month investigation 'includes coaches from across professional sports'. San Bernardino County sheriff's detectives and NFL investigators were assisting in the continuing investigation and more victims were being sought based on a search warrant that had been served, Reina said. A person impersonating a school representative contacted Tony Dungy (pictured), the former Tampa Bay and Indianapolis coach . Police did not know if Tarr had retained an attorney. A phone message left at a number listed in his name was not immediately returned. In October, University of Southern California athletic director Pat Haden said two people pretending to be school representatives contacted two coaches and tried to discuss the Trojans' football coaching vacancy. Haden said one of the pranksters repeatedly tried to speak to an unnamed member of the Denver Broncos' coaching staff about the USC opening. A person impersonating a school representative contacted Tony Dungy, the former Tampa Bay and Indianapolis coach. Afterwards, Dungy talked about his apparent contact with USC on a national radio show, saying he turned down the representative. Steve Sarkisian was later hired as coach. Dungy later tweeted that he had been misled by 'someone acting on their own' and apologised to Haden for the mix-up. Police would not comment on whether the USC calls were part of the investigation.

This was the moment a former city official was led away in handcuffs as she was found guilty of a string of corruption charges after pushing a neighbourhood to the brink of bankruptcy. Former Assistant City Manager Angela Spaccia brought the Los Angeles suburb of Bell - an area where more than a quarter of residents live below the poverty line - to its knees by approving enormous salaries of fellow officials. Jurors today found Spaccia guilty of 11 charges including conspiracy, misappropriating public funds, and falsification of public records. Former Assistant City Manager Angela Spaccia is led away in handcuffs after being found guilty of a string of corruption charges . Angela Spaccia, the former second in command in scandal-plagued Bell, is pictured in court yesterday . District Attorney Jackie Lacey called the verdict 'a victory for the people' saying that they were cheated out of $6million when Bell officials committed 'grand theft by paycheck'. Spaccia did not react to the verdict, but her mother and sister sobbed in the public gallery as the guilty verdict was read out. Although the maximum sentence for Spaccia's crimes is 17 years, the DA's office said that she is likely to receive a much lighter jail term. Spaccia was acquitted of hiding a public document involving the police chief's contract. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Kathleen Kennedy also declared a mistrial on another count after jurors deadlocked. During the trial Spaccia, 55, testified that she knew she was making too much money when her salary exceeded $340,000, but she maintained it wasn't criminal. She was left to stand trial alone after her former boss, Robert Rizzo, pleaded no contest to 69 corruption charges. During the trial Spaccia, 55, testified that she knew she was making too much money when her salary exceeded $340,000, but she maintained it wasn't criminal . Deputy District Attorney Sean Hassett said: 'She was unrepentant and refused to take any responsibility for her actions. They were thieves who used their power to steal money.' Spaccia began her job in 2003, and at first it appeared from the evidence that she was merely acting on Rizzo's orders 'like a brainwash,' juror Marco Islas said outside court. But by 2008 or 2009, things had changed. 'At the end, she knew what she was doing,' Islas said. By the end of her tenure, prosecutors said, Spaccia was making $564,000 a year in salary and other compensation. By the end of her tenure, prosecutors said, Spaccia was making $564,000 a year in salary and other compensation . Rizzo was giving himself an annual salary and benefits package of $1.2 million. His $800,000 in wages alone was double that of the president of the United States. Spaccia was not surprised by the verdicts because the lengthy deliberations - 10 days - led her to believe she would be found guilty of at least some charges, her attorney, Harland Braun, said outside court. 'Every judge and every jury in the Bell case wants to make an example of them,' Braun said of the defendants in the corruption trials. 'The overwhelming sense of the case is when you are making $500,000 a year, you should know something is wrong. 'When something seems too good to be true, it is too good to be true. She realizes that now.' The attorney said that Spaccia always maintained her innocence and never considered taking the same path as Rizzo, who in a plea deal acknowledged taking more than $5 million from the city. He agreed to testify against Spaccia, but the prosecution chose not to call him as a witness. In her testimony, Spaccia depicted Rizzo as a brilliant city manager who morphed into a greedy manipulator of people and money. She pointed out that she was absent when most of the problems occurred, having taken months off to care for a dying grandfather and her son who was seriously injured in a motorcycle accident. She said she became despondent and contemplated suicide after the Bell scandal broke, suffered a mental breakdown and was hospitalized for a time. Spaccia described city employees operating under the thumb of Rizzo who controlled all contracts and salaries. Former police chief Randy Adams testified that he was surprised when his demand for a salary of $457,000 a year was granted by Rizzo without protest. Spaccia seen walking free on bail after her original 2010 arrest for corruption . Adams depicted Spaccia as a powerless functionary who carried out Rizzo's orders. He also identified a 2009 email exchange in which he told Spaccia, 'I am looking forward to seeing you and taking all of Bell's money.' She responded, 'LOL. Well you can take your share of the pie. Just like us. We will all get fat together.' She then referred to what she said was a favorite saying of Rizzo - 'Pigs get fat; hogs get slaughtered' - and added they shouldn't be hogs, according to the email. Adams testified that the comments were made in jest and had been blown out of proportion. He was not charged in the case. Authorities said Rizzo also paid most members of the City Council about $100,000 a year, even though the panel met only about twice a month to handle matters for the city of about 35,000 people. Last March, five former Bell City Council members were convicted of fraud charges after authorities said they paid themselves salaries for sitting on boards and commissions that did no work and existed only to pay the defendants. Rizzo, 59, is scheduled to be sentenced on March 12 next year and could be sent to prison for 10 to 12 years. But he is expected to serve about half of that. He also is under investigation by federal authorities in a tax case.","Angela Spaccia, 55, found guilty of 11 corruption charges by jury today .

An 11-year-old boy found chained to a porch with a dead chicken tied around his neck last month had previously been cut across the face and burned with electrical wires by his foster father, according to an indictment. Authorities responding to a nearby call discovered the boy on the porch in Monroe, North Carolina on November 15, and his foster parents, Wanda Sue Larson and Dorian Harper, were arrested. The couple have now been indicted on child abuse charges and an indictment returned by a grand jury in Superior Court on Monday reveals shocking new details in the case. The couple, a former social services worker and her boyfriend, had legal guardianship of the boy and the indictment claims they heaped abuse on him between August and November. Accused: Dorian Harper, left, and Wanda Sue Larson, right, have been indicted on child abuse charges after a boy in their care was found chained to their porch with a chicken tied around his neck . The document says the boy was chained to a piece of railroad in his room and once, when he tried to escape, he broke his wrist, the Charlotte Observer reported. In another grisly incident, Haper allegedly cut the child's face with a knife and left a two-inch scar. He also allegedly used an electrical wire to burn the boy's face near his eye. They also allegedly stabled the boy's finger and left it permanently damaged, while another assault by the couple left him with a severe cut between his fingers that became infected. The child was never taken to the hospital for his injuries, the indictment said. Harper and Larson now face a combined 21 charges, including several counts of felony child abuse, assault with a deadly weapon and maiming. Cruel: As well as the bizarre chicken incident, the indictment claims the boy suffered cuts and burns to his face. It states that he also broke his wrist and never received medical attention for the injuries . When the boy was found in freezing . conditions, his leg had been chained to the porch railing with a pair of . handcuffs and the dead chicken was tied around his neck with twine. The deputy who found him approached the house and was . confronted by Harper. The deputy asked for Harper's identification and . an explanation as to why the child was handcuffed to the porch. According to WBTV, one of the children . opened the front door, releasing several large dogs who attacked the . deputy. By the time he had the dogs under control, Harper had removed . the child from the porch and left the dead chicken on a barrel in front . of the house. Other officers arrived and following a search of the house, a criminal investigation was opened. It is unclear what prompted the use of the dead chicken and handcuffs on the boy, but one of the boy's older brothers previously suggested the child had psychological issues and had likely mistreated the animal before the incident. Scene: The boy was found at this Monroe, North Carolina home by a deputy responding to a nearby call . Larson, who worked as a child protective services supervisor for Union County, was also indicted for willful failure to discharge her duty as a public figure.

Marijuana smoking laws have been relaxed by Denver City Council, allowing residents to smoke in full view of the general public, so long as it's done on the users' own balcony or front yard. The bill was approved by a vote of 10-3 on Monday night, according to The Denver Post, representing a complete about-face on the issue. Just two weeks ago the council gave preliminary approval to an amendment that would have banned marijuana use on private property if it could be seen or smelled by others. Out in the open: Residents in Denver, Colorado, are now allowed to smoke in public view, such as a front yard, porch or balcony, so long as it is on private property with the expressed permission of the property owner . The amendment was brought forward by councilwoman Jeanne Robb, who was against the 2012 legalization of recreational marijuana in Colorado and Washington state for persons over 21. In her proposal for a public ban, Robb said seeing people light up would send a dangerous message to children and would paint the city in a 'negative smoky haze'. 'We are being looked at nationally,' she told FoxNews. 'It’s really a balance of the rights of those who consume marijuana and the localities where they live. 'The message is clear: do not be blatant. Be discreet. Not in our streets, not in our sidewalks.' However a week later, council members reversed their position and adopted another amendment. A new bill passed by Denver City Council on Monday night in a vote of 10-3 allows residents to smoke in their front yards . The revised measure regulates marijuana in a similar way to that of alcohol, allowing people to smoke on their properties or with permission from the property, even if in public view. Labeled council Bill No. 13-736, it remains illegal for anyone to consume marijuana in public or for anyone under 21 to be possession of the drug. The first violation of those rules can be punished with a $150 fine. A second violation carries a $500 fine and each subsequent violation carries a $999 fine. Monday's decision to pass the measure is final, the council said. Colorado resident Chuck Teeples smokes marijuana during a marijuana legalization rally in downtown Denver . Also this week, a new website was launched as part of a public education effort. In Colorado, legal pot sales start on January 1.

A hallucinogenic drug used in shamanic rituals in the Amazon is growing in popularity in the U.S., researchers have found. Dimethyltryptamine, or DMT, is the active ingredient in ayahuasca, which is a plant-based mixture that can also be smoked to give users a hallucinatory 'journey' more extreme than that of LSD, ketamine or magic mushrooms. Adam Winstock, founder of the Global Drugs Survey, claims it has 'a larger proportion of new users' compared to other powerful drugs. Ayahuasca: A shaman in the Coafan region boils leaves for their psychoactive properties as used in ayahuasca, Ecuador, 2009 . This suggests 'its popularity may increase,' Winstock says in the latest issue of the Journal of Psychopharmacology, according to the Huffington Post. The survey's findings are supported by results of another study, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, conducted by the government, which found the number of people who have used DMT at some point has shot up from an estimated 688,000 in 2006 to 1.47 million in 2012. Smoked: The drug, pictured, which can be smoked is gaining popularity, particularly among young males . Male high school students were the most likely new users, Winstock found, and he says films are to blame for raising awareness about the drug. 'Mainstream interest since the release of the cult film ""Enter the Void"" in 2009 and the 2010 documentary ""DMT: The Spirit Molecule"", followed by a recent article in the influential youth magazine Vice featuring young people who had just smoked DMT will have raised awareness,' Winstock says. The Global Drug Survey is an anonymous study that provides a rare look into the illegal drugs being used at any point in time. Because the study isn't random, it doesn't show the prevalence of certain drugs but it can show, comparatively, which ones seem to be on the rise and how their users take them. According to the 2012 study, . conducted between November and December last year, DMT offers an . 'extreme hallucinatory experience' and users cite a 'bad trip' as a . potential risk. 'The . majority of users rated the effect of DMT as stronger than ketamine, . magic mushrooms and LSD,' the article explains, adding that they call it . a 'journey' rather than a trip to describe how the experience stands . apart, in kind and degree, to anything else. Ayahuasca brew is a combination of two plants that grow in South America. Journey: Users call a trip a 'journey' to describe how the experience stands apart, in kind and degree, to anything else . The first, Psychotria viridis, contains DMT which is listed as a Schedule I drug under the U.S. Controlled Substances Act. By itself, though, DMT has no real effect and requires the second plant in the brew, Banisteriopsis caapi, to enable the brain to neutralize DMT. The brew first came to the attention of Western scientists in 1851, but Amazonian tribes have been using it as a medicinal and religious aid for centuries. In the past decade psychedelic tourism has grown steadily, with Western tourists heading to countries like Peru, Ecuador and Brazil to experience an ayahuasca journey.","Dimethyltryptamine, or DMT, is the active ingredient in ayahuasca, which is a plant-based mixture that can also be smoked .

Witty is free on bail and Janow is expected to surrender on Tuesday. It wasn't immediately clear whether they had obtained lawyers. Brazen: Witty couldn't resist bragging about his daring heist . Sheriff's deputies work near the wreckage of a Porsche that crashed into a light pole on November 30 killing actor Paul Walker . The wrecked Porsche Carrera GT was being hauled by a flat-bed tow truck hours after the wreck that claimed the movie star and friend Roger Rodas, who was driving the vehicle when it crashed. The tow truck stopped at a red light and a male jumped out of a car following it to grab a piece of the car – he then hopped back into his car and sped away, according to police. The tow truck driver immediately reported the theft. A search warrant was executed on Thursday at Rodas’ home, police found the stolen car panel - a part from the sports car's roof - and arrested him on the spot. Witty has since taken to Instagram to apologize for his actions. 'I wanted to say my intensions for the piece I took off the two truck were to make a memorial out of it. Paul was a childhood idol to me and many. Witty, who faces up to four and half years in jail, has written this apology on his Instagram account . Their final ride: The Red Porsche GT in which Fast and Furious actor Paul Walker died along with his friend Roger Rodas . 'At the time I was not thinking about the consequences it could have, I never wanted it to be like this I wasn't going to sell the piece to make a profit. Noboy in this world is perfect, we all make mistakes,' he wrote. 'Some bigger than others. My deepest apologies go to Paul's family. And I'm going to say with confidence that I messed up big time, but continue on with life as should you all.' The investigation into the crash that killed both Walker and Rodas is still ongoing.","Jameson Witty stole a piece of the Porsche wreckage left after the accident that claimed actor Paul Walker's life .

Major Robb McDonald was awarded a Silver Star Monday for his bravery during the September 2012 attack on Camp Bastion, which apparently targeted Prince Harry. The Marine Corps air base in Afghanistan had been raided by 15 heavily armed Taliban insurgents, jets were exploding and a lake of fuel was aflame when McDonald arrived on the scene, and found his commanding officer dead. With some 50 Marines holed up in an aluminum-sided building that officials later called indefensible, the former force reconnaissance Marine who already has two Bronze Star medals for valor in combat, took the helm and led a counterattack, which ended in 14 of the enemy dead and one wounded. Brave: U.S. Marine Maj. Robb T. McDonald stands in front of an audience at Camp Pendleton, California, as he is awarded the Silver Star Medal, Monday, December 9, 2013 . Staff Sgt. Jesse Colburn, an ejection seat mechanic on duty that night, said he and the other 'air wing guys' who only had a month of such training were doing their best until McDonald arrived. He had run a mile over exposed territory, armed only with a pistol, to get to the scene. '(McDonald) walks around with this aura, like, ""Fear not. I'm here."" When he showed up and took action. ...You could see, a lot of Marines took a sigh of relief,' Colburn said, according to UTSandiego.com. The attack killed two men and ended the careers of two generals whose heads rolled because they failed to secure the base after troop withdrawals. Prince Harry was serving at the base when the Taliban fighters dressed in U.S. Army uniforms to unleash the ground assault on September 14 and destroyed or damaged eight aircraft worth a total of $200 million. Serving Royal: Prince Harry was at Camp Bastian when the fighting broke out . Reliving the day: Details of the September 2012 raid were state secrets until September this year . According to an investigation by the U.S. Central Command, the insurgents had split into three teams of five men and began a coordinated, practiced attack with rifles and grenades against the allied forces. But despite the horror, a hero emerged that night. On Monday, a Marine Corps official pinned the Silver Star, the nation's third-highest medal for combat, on McDonald's chest. 'I feel really proud and honored,' the 37-year-old married father-of-two said after the ceremony at Camp Pendleton. He is the 45th Marine to be awarded the Silver Star for the war in Afghanistan. McDonald was executive officer of a Marine Harrier jet squadron at the time of the attack. He was asleep in his room when he was awoken by machine gun fire and he and two others, armed only with pistols, sprinted toward the action, and could as easily have been shot by their own men as the enemy. When he arrived, McDonald realized Lt. Col. Christopher Raible, commanding officer of Marine Attack Squadron 211, was dead. Sgt. Bradley Atwell was also killed and eight other U.S. troops, eight British forces and one civilian were wounded. Ruin: This picture shows what remains of one of the six Harrier jets in the aftermath of the Taliban attack on Camp Bastion on Sept. 14, 2012 . Base: Camp Bastion is the main British and U.S. military base in Afghanistan. Accommodating 28,000 people it is situated northwest of Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand Province and is several square miles in size . McDonald then led U.S. and British troops in a counter-attack and the fight lasted into the early morning of September 15. They killed 14 and wounded the remaining one, who was later interrogated. Raible, nominated for a posthumous Silver Star for his actions that night, was awarded a Bronze Star with V for valor. A year later, the Marine Corps commandant asked two generals, Major General Charles 'Mark' Gurganus and Major General Gregg Sturdevant, to retire an investigation determined they both underestimated the enemy, failed to build a unified security effort and didn't provide proper oversight. In September this year, Britain's Ministry of Defence insisted Prince Harry was treated 'like any other serviceman' during the Taliban assault after a GQ magazine feature suggested he was 'stashed in a secure location’ when fighting started during the Camp Bastion. An MoD spokesman said: 'Claims that Captain (Harry) Wales was rushed to a ""safe room"" during the insurgent attack on Camp Bastion are simply not true. We do not comment on individual security measures for very good reasons, but it would be clear from the extensive coverage of his tour that he was treated much the same as any service member deployed to Camp Bastion.' Prince Harry had arrived for a three-month tour flying an Apache helicopter, prompting the Taliban to threaten to kill or kidnap him. 'We have informed our commanders in Helmand to do whatever they can to eliminate him,' Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid had told the press four days earlier.","Major Robb McDonald was awarded a Silver Star Monday for his bravery during the September 2012 attack on Camp Bastion .

Novelist Jilly Cooper says a fond farewell to husband Leo at his funeral in Bisley, Gloucestershire . Novelist Jilly Cooper has today said a fond farewell to her husband Leo, who passed away following a 12-year battle with Parkinson's Disease. The 76-year-old author welcomed mourners, friends and family for his funeral in the village of Bisley, Gloucestershire - where the couple had lived since 1982. Her husband of 52 years Leo Cooper passed away on November 29, aged 79. The publisher of military books was diagnosed with Parkinson's in 2001. Devoted Jilly - who first met Leo when she was nine years old - refused to put him into care, instead insisting on looking after him at home in Gloucestershire. The novelist confessed that she continued to write fiction as a means of paying for Leo's medical bills. Dressed in a blue patterned dress and black knee-high boots, Jilly sought shelter from the bitter December weather in a black suede coat with a fur trim. Cutting a sombre figure, the How To Stay Married and Riders author, embraced those who joined her and her family to say their goodbyes to Leo. She watched as pall bearers carried his wicker casket, bearing a huge bouquet of cream lillies, into the quaint village church. The couple became an item after the breakdown of Leo's first marriage, after meeting years earlier in the late 1940s at a children's party. Author Jilly recalled in a tribute marking the couple's 40th anniversary and published in the Daily Mail being impressed by Leo after he hurled a 'ruby-red jelly at a tiresome little girl'. When Jilly was 14 years old, Leo sent her a Valentine covered in ruby-red hearts, writing inside: 'Isn't this awful?' And it was 10 years later, while the . novelist was working at the Ideal Home Exhibition, selling candelabra . that she met him once again, at a dinner party. She recalled: 'I found him achingly funny, and he had those dark, untamed, gipsy good looks I've always thought attractive.' Pall bearers carry the wicker casket of Leo Cooper into the Cotswold's church, near Stroud . Former Mail On Sunday columnist Jilly embraces the minister, left, and right is seen leaving the church surrounded by family and friends . The couple met in the late 1940s at a children's party when Jilly was nine. They married in 1961 and later adopted their two children Felix, now 44 and Emily, 41 . To win his future wife's attention Leo, a publisher, sent her proof copies of forthcoming novels, instead of lavishing her with chocolates and flowers. She added: 'Within a few days, I had decided the only ideal home for me was in his arms. 'When he proposed, I ecstatically decided my ship had come home.' The couple tied the knot on October 7, 1961 at Chelsea Register Office, followed by a blessing, a family lunch and a drinks party in the evening at the Basil Street Hotel in Knightsbridge. They returned from their Norfolk honeymoon to set up their first home in Kensington with Leo's cat Michael. Towards the end of the 1960s the Cooper's moved to Fulham and it was their they adopted their two children, Felix, now 44 and a property developer, in 1968. Three years later they became parents to Emily, now 41, and a make-up artist. The marriage was famously happy and survived Leo’s affair in the Nineties, which Jilly described as ‘cataclysmic’. Mourners join Jilly Cooper and her family at the service to celebrate the life of publisher Leo, who died on November 29 aged 79 following a battle with Parkinson's Disease . Dozens paid their respects to the man Jilly described as the 'stalwart captain of my ship' in a tribute piece to mark the couple's 40th wedding anniversary and published in the Daily Mail . The family moved to Putney Common where they acquired pet dogs before finally ending up in Gloucestershire where they lived out the final years of their marriage. Their children gave the couple four grandchildren Jago, Lysander, Acer and Scarlett. In the tribute piece to mark their Ruby wedding anniversary, re-published last week to mark his death, former Mail On Sunday columnist, Jilly wrote: 'What I had wanted to say was that, although on October 7, 1961, I felt my ship had come home, marriage was, in fact, more like a tiny rowing boat with only two oarsmen setting out on a vast uncharted ocean. 'During our marriage we had encountered heavenly sunsets and sunrises and days of blue sky, when Felix, then Emily arrived, when he, then she, sailed through their A-levels, or Leo won prizes for his books. But we had also run into terrible tempests and killer whales, which had almost overturned our boat. 'Felix nearly dying of meningitis, me lurking in the potting shed in Putney for days on end to avoid our creditors, the bank bullying us to sell our home in Gloucestershire. 'Somehow, we’d managed to cling together and row on. 'In all those years, I couldn’t have had a dearer, kinder, more stalwart captain of my ship. 'I remember how, three days after our 40th anniversary party, a little deer wandered out of the sunset across the lawn and, like the finger of God, allowed Leo to stroke her smooth, brown head. 'These foolish things remind me of you.' Jilly and Leo Cooper, pictured left at a polo match, settled in Gloucestershire.

Narrowly beating a midnight deadline, Congress voted on Monday to renew an expiring ban on plastic firearms that can evade airport detection machines. But Republicans blocked an effort to toughen the restrictions - the latest defeat for gun-control forces in the year since the grade school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut. President Barack Obama signed the law before midnight, using an auto pen as he traveled to Africa for ceremonies honoring the late South African President Nelson Mandela. Racing a midnight deadline, the Senate gave final congressional approval on Monday evening to a 10-year extension of the prohibition against guns that can slip past metal detectors and X-ray machines . The device Obama used to sign the bill has been used for the signatures of traveling presidents since the administration of President George W. Bush. By voice vote, the Senate gave final congressional approval to a 10-year extension of the prohibition against guns that can slip past metal detectors and X-ray machines. The House voted last week for an identical decade-long renewal of the ban. GOP senators rejected an effort by Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to strengthen the ban by requiring that such weapons contain un-detachable metal parts. Some plastic guns meet the letter of the current law with a metal piece that can be removed, making them a threat to be slipped past security screeners at schools, airports and elsewhere. Undetectable: Authorities are concerned that plastic 3-D guns could be brought into places such as schools or government buildings where metal detectors wouldn't find them . Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, top . Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Congress should . extend the ban for a decade and study Schumer's more restrictive plan to . make sure it doesn't interfere with technologies used by legitimate gun . manufacturers. He said the bill's recent introduction suggests that ‘the real objectives were things other than just getting an extension.’ At a news conference later, Schumer said he had ‘no ulterior motive’ in proposing to strengthen the ban and said he hoped to find compromise with Grassley in coming weeks. ‘The bottom line is technology advances and it does good things and it does bad things,’ he said. Underscoring the issue's political sensitivity, both of Monday's votes were on unanimous consent requests. That meant any single senator could scuttle the proposals by objecting. It also meant the votes were by voice and that no individual senators' votes were recorded. For a handful of Democratic senators seeking re-election next year in GOP-leaning states, the day's votes could have been difficult. President Barack Obama signed the law before midnight, using an auto pen as he traveled to Africa for ceremonies honoring the late South African President Nelson Mandela . The National Rifle Association, which . has been instrumental in blocking gun restrictions, expressed no . opposition to renewing the law. But the gun lobby said it would fight . any expanded requirements, including Schumer's, ‘that would infringe on . our Second Amendment rights’ to bear arms. The rejection of stricter curbs highlighted the repeated setbacks for gun-control advocates in Congress since last Dec. 14. On that day, a gunman fatally shot 20 first-graders and six staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School before killing himself. Despite that - and other recent mass shootings, including at the Washington Navy Yard just blocks from the Capitol - supporters of expanded gun control are nearing the end of a year in which they have been unable to push any new firearms restrictions through Congress. ‘We're several decades behind the NRA,’ said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. ‘This is a long game, and it's going to take us some time to build up the resources necessary to compete.’ It is almost a year since a gunman fatally shot 20 first-graders and six staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School before killing himself . Congressional Republicans have . resisted tightening the restrictions against undetectable guns, but . those lawmakers - as well as the NRA - have not opposed renewing the . current prohibition. The House approved a 10-year extension last week. Plastic . guns were in their infancy when President Ronald Reagan and Congress . first enacted the ban against undetectable firearms, and when it was . renewed in 1998 and 2003. But such weapons have become a growing threat . and can now be produced by 3-D printers, which are becoming better and . more affordable. Supporters of tightening the rules say the 10-year renewal helps the gun lobby because it reduces Democrats' ability to revisit the issue. The Sandy Hook killings prompted Obama and Democrats to make gun control a top domestic priority this year - but to no avail in Congress. Their most stinging loss occurred in April, when the Senate turned aside an effort to expand federal background checks for would-be gun purchasers, an effort to prevent criminals and mentally ill people from getting weapons. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., center, and Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., arrive to talk to reporters about their effort to renew the ban on plastic firearms that can evade airport detection machines, at the Capitol in Washington on Monday . That measure would have required the checks for all sales at gun shows and online - expanding a system that is currently required only for sales through licensed firearms dealers. Also defeated were proposed bans on assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition magazines.In a measure of GOP opposition and NRA clout, those proposals never even came to votes in the Republican-majority House. But with Saturday's Newtown anniversary approaching, Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Pa., a psychologist, plans to announce legislation on Thursday aimed at boosting federal mental health programs, including treatment, research and training for workers who respond to emergencies. The lack of movement in the Democratic-led Senate has left gun-control groups divided about their 2014 goals. Some are willing to set aside, for now, the push for expanded background checks and settle for more modest changes. By voice vote, the Senate gave final congressional approval to a 10-year extension of the prohibition against guns that can slip past metal detectors and X-ray machines on Monday night . These could include strengthening mental health programs and having states provide more records to the federal background check system. Backing this approach are some Newtown families and the group Americans for Responsible Solutions, formed by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., seriously wounded by a shooter, and her husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly. Others want to continue raising pressure on lawmakers to back strong background check requirements, and they oppose aiming for less. These groups include Mayors Against Illegal Guns, led by outgoing New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an organization that has been spending money against gun-rights congressional candidates and lawmakers. These groups are concerned that Republicans would use votes for weaker efforts to cast themselves as having championed major steps against guns.","The ban on plastic firearms that can evade airport detection has been renewed for another 10 years .

Three courts have now denied the efforts of an animal rights group that was pushing for chimpanzees to be granted the same rights as human beings. The Nonhuman Rights Project filed three different lawsuits in an effort to get four chimps- Tommy, Kiko, Hercules and Leo- the legal rights ‘to bodily liberty’ but the courts rejected their arguments. Tommy, the 26-year-old ape, is owned by Pat Levery in Gloversville, New York, and in spite of the animal rights’ group claims that the animal is confined in a ‘prison’, Mr Levery said that the cage where Tommy lives in is completely adequate. ‘I’d be happy to show you Tommy’s home, to show you how well he is cared for,’ Mr Levery told CNN after the ruling against the lawsuit was announced. Remaining with their owners: Three lawsuits in New York have kept chimpanzees (similar to those above) in the care of their owners even though an animal rights group wanted to have them placed in a sanctuary . The group sought to have a court-backed order handed out that would free the four chimps from their caged confines, allowing them to live the rest of their lives in a primate sanctuary. 'In this case, we are claiming that chimpanzees are autonomous,' the group’s founder Massachusetts lawyer Steven Wise said. 'That is, being able to self-determine, be self-aware, and be able to choose how to live their own lives.' Even before the rejected verdicts were handed down, Wise said he didn’t expect the decisions to be favorable because the judges have no legal precedent to rely on. He added: 'We'll take it to the Appellate Division and then the state Court of Appeals. We've been preparing for lawsuits for many years. These are the first in a long series of suits that will chip away at the legal thinghood of such non-human animals as chimpanzees.' The national group says it is dedicated to changing the common law status of some species other than humans. The group's board of directors includes Wise and chimpanzee research pioneer Jane Goodall. The lawsuits include affidavits from scientists who say chimpanzees have complex cognitive abilities, such as awareness of the past and the ability to make choices, and display complex emotions such as empathy. 'Once we prove that chimpanzees are autonomous, that should be sufficient for them to gain legal personhood and at least have their fundamental interests protected by human rights,' Wise said. Against his will: A nonhuman rights group sued a couple in New York for illegally detaining their chimpanzee named Tommy (who is not pictured above) in a cage on their trailer park and lost the case . If the lawsuits had succeeded, similar ones were planned on behalf of other species considered autonomous, such as gorillas, orangutans, whales, dolphins and elephants. Tommy’s lawsuit was filed in the state Supreme Court in Fulton County, while a different one was filed in Niagara Falls on behalf of Kiko who currently lives in a cage in a brick building. Kiko’s owners Carmen and Christie Presti have said they plan to move Kiko and other monkeys to a new facility on a large rural property. The third lawsuit were filed on behalf of the remaining two chimpanzees who are used as part of locomotion research at Stony Brook University on Long Island. All three have since been rejected. David Favre, a professor of animal law at Michigan State University who's not part of the lawsuit, said chimpanzees ought to have recognition within the legal system. He said animals typically are protected by anti-cruelty and animal welfare laws, but prosecutors often don't pursue animal cruelty complaints. He called the lawsuits 'unprecedented' and said if they had succeeded, 'it would be the first time a court has been willing to step forward and examine the living conditions that a particular chimpanzee is in, and take jurisdiction over the chimpanzee and move it someplace more suitable to its needs.'","The Nonhuman Rights Project argued that four chimps in New York were being 'detained against their will'

A Christopher Walken look-a-like who allegedly tried to abduct a student from a New Jersey college campus nearly three years ago has been found not guilty by reason of insanity. Tony Kadyhrob, 70, was arrested in March . 2011 after trying to force a 19-year-old woman into his car at Rider . University’s Lawrence campus. He has been held in Trenton Psychiatric Hospital since Superior Court Judge Pedro Jimenez ruled last December that he was unfit to stand trial. Tony Kadyhrob, right, was arrested in March 2011 after trying to force a 19-year-old woman into his car at Rider University’s Lawrence campus. When Kadyhrob's mugshot was first circulated on the internet, people commented on his close resemblance to actor Christopher Walken, left . The ruling on Kadyhrob’s sanity was actually made last month, but he hadn’t present and had never been informed of the decision. Kadyhrob eventually discovered the outcome during a court hearing on Monday and he expressed his surprise at the ruling, reports NJ.com. ‘I’m in the dark. I really have no idea what’s going on around me,’ he told Jimenez. Kadyhrob also complained to the judge that he had tried to dismiss his attorney Jennifer Gottschalk. ‘I fired her,’ Kadyhrob said. ‘I have no idea why she’s here right now.’ Kadyrhob’s sister originally retained Gottschalk as private council, but Jimenez requested she stay on the case after Kadyrhob attempted to fire her. She blamed a scheduling error for Kadyrhob having missed his last court date. Tony Kadyhrob, 70, was arrested in March 2011 after trying to force a 19-year-old woman into his car at Rider University's Lawrence campus . ‘Somehow, the facility where he is right now did not get contacted,’ she said. ‘This is the first opportunity we’ve all been present.’ Kadyhrob was declared unfit to stand trial last year after being evaluated by multiple mental health experts. 'He is in a mental unit. He is a paranoid schizophrenic. He hears voices,' his sister explained in 2011. 'He is not a criminal. He has been ill for about 30 years.

Defence chiefs controversially delayed introducing a warning system which could have prevented a mid-air collision between RAF jets that killed three airmen. Squadron Leader Samuel Bailey and Flight Lieutenants Hywel Poole and Adam Sanders died when two £40million Tornado GR4 warplanes crashed during a training mission over north-east Scotland. The fighter-bombers, each carrying a pilot and a navigator, spun out of control and plunged into the Moray Firth on July 2012. Killed: Flight Lieutenant Adam Sanders, pictured, was one of the men killed in the 2012 crash . Wreckage: These chunks of the Tornado jet planes were recovered from the Moray Firth, where the planes crashed last July . But the Ministry of Defence yesterday confirmed it had identified a collision warning system for the fast jets four years before the fatal accident. And the state-of-the-art £53.5million device was not finally approved for the Tornados until October 2012 - three months after the tragedy. Military sources said cost-saving in the cash-strapped MoD meant the RAF was forced to shelve the scheme in favour of other kit. An RAF board of inquiry has completed a report on last summer's collision and handed a copy to the procurator fiscal who will decide whether a fatal accident inquiry (FAI) will be held. The board's findings have not been published. The conclusions of the report are understood to be 'problematic' for defence chiefs, a source told the Mail. Last night Angus Robertson, the Moray SNP MP, said the absence of collision avoidance equipment on the Tornados should be 'an important consideration' for any inquiry into the doomed aircraft. Tragic: Flight Lieutenant Hywel Poole, left, and Squadron Leader Samuel . Bailey, right, also died in the crash . He said: 'No doubt the absence of a collision avoidance system in Tornado fast jets will be an important consideration and these parliamentary answers from the Ministry of Defence shed light on the issue. 'As in all tragic cases which involved the death and injury of service personnel our thoughts must be with those directly and indirectly affected. 'It is imperative that all lessons are learnt from the Tornado collision over the Moray Firth.' Mr Robertson uncovered the delay in the procurement of collision warning equipment for the fighter jets after asking a series of Parliamentary Questions. Defence Equipment Minister Philip Dunne confirmed a 'commercial off-the-shelf' traffic collision avoidance system' was recommended by the MoD in 2008. He said the £53.5million was approved for installation in October 2012 and a contract for the work required was awarded in December that year. Tributes: A family lays flowers at Lossiemouth airbase following the crash . The first two jets to be fitted with the system were delivered to the RAF in August this year. The roll out of the equipment is to be completed by December 2014. Mr Dunne said: 'A Tornado traffic collision avoidance system has been developed which is expected to achieve initial operating capability by the end of next year.' Insiders in Whitehall said the delay in approving the collision warning system had occurred because of a shortage of cash at the MoD. The Tory-led Coalition elected in May 2010 was forced to order the sprawling department to make savings of £4.7billion over five years and plug a £38billion black hole in funding for the equipment programme. 'There was only a limited amount of money,' said one source. 'If you haven't got it, you can't spend.' Defence chiefs might also have thought twice about spending millions of pounds upgrading warplanes that will be taken out of service in 2018. Slavage: The Tornado's wheel is visible as the wreckage is retrieved . Checks: Air ground crew work on Tornado planes at RAF Lossiemouth in the days following the crash . Sq Ldr Bailey, 36, from Nottingham, Flt Lt Poole, 28, from Bangor, North Wales, and Flt Lt Sanders, 27, from Lancashire, died in the accident close to the Beatrice oilfield in the Moray Firth. Sq Ldr Paul Evans survived but was badly injured. The crew were all from 15 (Reserve) Squadron based at RAF Lossiemouth. They were understood to be taking part in practice bombing runs in fog. The Tornado GR4 is a two-seat attack aircraft which is capable of delivering a variety of bombs and missiles, including Brimstone, Paveway and Storm Shadow, has a maximum altitude of 50,000ft and a top speed of Mach 1.3. The Tornado has been in service with the RAF since 1979 and the frontline squadrons are veterans of a string of conflicts with hundreds of hours flying experience. An MoD spokesman said: 'There are already a range of mitigation measures in place to minimise the risk of mid-air collision and tragic incidents such as that in Moray are extremely rare. 'A specifically designed Tornado Collision Warning System, which will be another tool for pilots to use, is currently being trialled and will be in service in next year.'","Three airmen died when two Tornado jets collided over Scotland in 2012 .

The boss of the private company responsible for Army recruitment has blamed Britain 'not having any wars on' after he failed to sign up enough new soldiers. Paul Pinder, the chief executive of Capita which has a £400m Ministry of Defence contract to recruit full and part-time soldiers, made the remark as he was grilled by MPs on his failure to hit targets. He was immediately accused of 'disrespecting' 6,000 service personnel currently battling the Taliban in Afghanistan and those killed and maimed on the frontline during the 12-year conflict. Since Capita took charge of bringing in new recruits the number of interviews and selection tests has plummeted by more than a third. Blame game: Paul Pindar, chief executive of Capita, has been accused of 'disrespecting' 6,000 service personnel currently battling the Taliban in Afghanistan after he said a recruitment problem was caused by a 'lack of war' Just two weeks ago father-of-two Sergeant Major Ian Fisher, 42, of the 3rd Battalion the Mercian Regiment, died in a suicide blast in Helmand. Mr Pinder was being questioned by the Public Accounts Committee on why Capita was failing to meet recruitment targets despite being paid huge sums of taxpayers' money. He said: 'I'm not being flippant when saying this, but we actually have the disadvantage of not having any wars on. 'Soldiers like to join the Army when there's actually something for them to do. It's actually true.' 3,259 potential troops sent to Army selection interviews, compared with 5,042 the previous year. 195 would-be officers were recruited compared to 379 a year earlier. 367 potential Territorial Army troops were recruited by Capita against a target of 1,432. Committee chairman Margaret Hodge said: 'That was awful. It's a kick in the teeth to the soldiers on the ground in Afghanistan.' Mr Pinder last year received £2million in pay and perks compared to the £17,000 salary of a new Army private was roundly criticised last night. Madeleine Moon, of the Defence Select Committee, said: 'This is a pathetic and offensive attempt to excuse his company's failure to recruit service personnel. 'It is insulting to all of the service personnel who have served and are serving our country on a variety of settings around the world.' Colonel Richard Kemp, who commanded British troops in Afghanistan, said: 'For the chief executive of the company that is responsible for recruiting for the Army not to realise we are today fighting a war which has seen some of the most intense battles since World War 2 and in which 446 soldiers have been killed is quite extraordinary and raises further questions about the viability of Capita in this role.' A serving military officer who has fought in Helmand said: 'This is thoroughly disrespectful. His company is in charge of recruiting for the Army - it's astonishing he isn't aware we have thousands of personnel risking their lives on the frontline.' Killed: Ian Fisher, from the 3rd Battalion The Mercian Regiment (Staffords), who died in Helmand two weeks ago . Sergeant Major Fisher was deployed with his company on a two-day operation when a vehicle-borne suicide attack was launched . The Ministry of Defence privatised Army recruitment in April. The ten-year deal was supposed to free 1,000 soldiers from recruitment roles and enable them to return to frontline duties. But problems in installing and using a secure computer system meant Capital had suffered problems in drafting new soldiers. In the first four months of its contract, Capita sent 3,259 potential troops to Army selection interviews, compared with 5,042 the previous year. Only 195 would-be officers were recruited compared to 379 a year earlier. And 367 potential Territorial Army troops were recruited by Capita against a target of 1,432. The row broke out as the Defence Secretary narrowly avoided a humiliating Commons defeat over controversial plans to replace full-time troops with Army reservists. Defence secretary Philip Hammond came under fire is axing the number of regular soldiers from 102,000 to 82,000 while doubling the number of part-time troops to 30,000 to save money. Tory rebels, spearheaded by former infantry officer John Baron, had tabled an amendment urging ministers to halt the shake-up. Mr Baron said: 'Things are not going well, recruitment targets for reservists are being badly missed, Territorial Army numbers are falling and there is a widening capability gap as a result.' His plot was backed by Labour and the DUP. Shadow defence secretary Vernon Coaker said: 'If we don't get it right we are taking risks with this country's defence and security.' But Mr Hammond said the amendment would halt the process of recruiting reservists, sending 'completely the wrong signal to those thinking of joining the reserves'. He said it would 'hit morale among the existing reserve forces and make future recruitment a much more difficult task.' The rebel amendment was defeated by 306 votes to 252, Government majority 54.","Claim made by boss of firm, Capita, with £400m Ministry of Defence contract .

A Royal Marine accused of executing a seriously-wounded Taliban prisoner wrote in his diary that he pleaded with his commander to shoot the stricken man, a court martial heard. The 25-year-old serviceman, identified only as Marine C, described how he desired to kill the injured Afghan insurgent – and was ‘waiting to pop him’. He recorded in his diary that his sergeant, known as Marine A, refused – then blasted the enemy captive in the chest at close range with his 9mm pistol. Marine A is on trial with two comrades, identified as Marine B and C, who allegedly helped and encouraged the killing of the detainee during a patrol in Helmand. File photo . Marine C wrote how he felt ‘mugged off’ that he had not been allowed to pull the trigger. His barrister, Marcus Tregilgas-Davey QC, yesterday told the court martial that the diary should be treated ‘with caution’ as it was 'simply unreliable'. He said Marine C and his comrades had been encouraged to write diaries by the Royal Navy as a ‘coping mechanism’ to deal with the stress of fighting on the frontline in Afghanistan. Some entries had been ‘embellished, exaggerated and distorted,’ Mr Tregilgas-Davey told the seven-strong court martial board. Marine C is on trial for murder along with two comrades, Marine A and B. C and B allegedly helped and encouraged Marine A to kill the detainee during a patrol in Helmand on September 15, 2011. All three deny the charges. Film footage of the shooting, captured on a camera mounted on the helmet of Marine B, has been played to the hearing in Bulford, Wiltshire. The victim was found with an AK47 assault rifle and grenade after an Apache helicopter blitzed him with cannon fire following an attack on a British base. On the video, Marine C can be heard asking if he could shoot the wounded prisoner in the head and heart – but he dismissed this as ‘banter’ to defuse stressful situations. The court martial in Bulford, Wiltshire, continues . Marine C has told the court martial how up to 20 comrades had already been killed or maimed by Taliban bombs and bullets by the day of the incident. Some victims’ blown off limbs had been hung in trees by insurgents as ‘trophies’. In his closing statement, Mr Tregilgas-Davey said Marine C was the point man operating the Vallon bomb detector, sweeping the ground for IEDs. It meant the married marine was most at risk of stepping on a booby-trap bomb. He said: 'It is difficult to think of a more stressful, demanding job. He was physically exhausted, his nerves were frayed, he was jumping at every bang and loud noise.' Referring to the diary, Mr Tregilgas-Davey said: ‘It is not supposed to be a near accurate account of events; in part it was a therapeutic aid, a way of releasing the stress that Marine C was under by putting his thoughts down on paper. 'Some things are factually accurate, some things have been embellished, exaggerated and distorted. 'It is venting the tensions and stresses of an operational tour, combining events and facts with emotions and feelings. That is a heady mix.' He said it was just 'bravado' because Marine C was 'scared and angry'. Mr Tregilgas-Davey said writing down feelings was a recognised psychological technique, outlined in a pamphlet called Royal Navy: Trauma And Resilience which was handed to all troops. He said: ‘It seems a little harsh to encourage an individual to write down their feelings on combat stress and then to use these jottings against that individual. 'Don't condemn Marine C for a couple of pages of a diary written with hindsight, demonstrably false in some places, written as a way of coping with tensions and stresses, not an accurate chronicle of events.' Mr Tregilgas-Davey said Marine C had been ordered away from the victim when he was shot so was ‘not present’. He said: 'It was sudden spur-of-the-moment decision made by Marine A alone, without encouragement or assistance from Marine C.' The court martial continues.

"By . Ian Drury . PUBLISHED: . 20:37 EST, 14 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:37 EST, 14 November 2013 . A Fijian soldier who moved to the UK after serving in the British Army for nine years faces deportation on Sunday because of a simple administrative blunder. Private Filimone Lacanivalu, who served in Northern Ireland, Bosnia, the Falklands and Afghanistan, left  the 2nd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment in 2010. Mistakenly believing Commonwealth troops automatically  qualified to remain in Britain after more than four years in the military, he failed to apply to the Home Office for residency within 28 days of leaving the Army and missed the paperwork’s deadline. Years of service: Filimon Lacanialu, left, is pictured on patrol in the Falkland Islands . Now Pte Lacanivalu, 34, has spent a month detained by the UK Border Agency in an immigration removal centre at Harmondsworth, near Heathrow, awaiting deportation on Sunday. Others held at the centre include murderers, rapists and drug dealers. Last night he said he felt ‘betrayed’ by Britain. He said: ‘It is confusing, sad and depressing. ‘I never dreamt that this is the place that I would end up... I have been let down. I have been betrayed.’ In a plea to Prime Minister David Cameron, he said: ‘Please take account of my military service and what I have done for Great Britain. Release me from here and I will continue my life as usual.’ Pte Lacanivalu’s case has left the Government accused once again of ‘abandoning’ the military, following round after round of spending cuts. It comes after the furore over Fiji-born Lance Corporal Bale Baleiwai, a veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan, who was threatened with deportation because he was disciplined by his commanding officer for a fight with a colleague in 2010. Following an outcry, he was granted an 11th hour reprieve. Campaigners for Pte Lacanivalu will contrast his case with that of foreigners who have been allowed to stay in Britain despite awful crimes, such as Iraqi Aso Mohammed Ibrahim, who left a girl of 12 to die under the wheels of his car. His case also appears at odds with Mr Cameron’s pledge to uphold the Military Covenant, society’s duty of care to servicemen. Pleae: Pte Lacanivalu has begged the Prime Minister to intervene and let him stay in the country because of his military service . Pte Lacanivale, whose uncles served in the Army, including one who fought with the Parachute Regiment in the Falklands, signed up with 2 YORKS in 2001 after seeing photographs of ceremonial parades at Buckingham Palace. He served in Northern Ireland, Bosnia, the Falklands and deployed on two tours of fierce fighting in Afghanistan. He said: ‘That was the first time for me to see people getting wounded and killed.’ He left the Forces in January 2010 but several months later received documents from the Army informing him he should have applied for residency within 28 days. The soldier claimed he was not told of this requirement while in the Army. He hired a solicitor to issue a belated application to remain in Britain but he was informed in September he had been rejected. On October 12 he went to a Home Office centre in Croydon, South London, hoping to resolve the situation but he was detained without being allowed to return to his flat to collect his belongings. Now Vinita Templeton, a solicitor with law firm Duncan Lewis, is planning to launch a judicial review action against his detention, which would include an application to block Pte Lacanivalu’s imminent deportation. Ian Sadler, the father of Trooper Jack Sadler, killed in Afghanistan while Pte Lacanivalu was on the frontline, said he was ‘dismayed’ by the situation. He said: ‘He should be put up in a hotel and a civil servant should straighten this out.’ A Home Office spokesman said: ‘Mr Lacanivalu applied to stay in the UK outside of the period. However, due to his service with the Army his case is now under review.’","Private Filimone Lacanivalu signed up to the army in 2001 .

On the way back down to the CP, it came over the Coy net that 2 more men they'd tracked were up at compound 46 W5S, just West of us, and were about to get smashed by the AH. We went firm to watch/wait to see if we were needed and waited... When the strike when in it was sound, AH let loose with 30mm and the geezer got smashed. As he'd been heading East at the time, across a field, we got tasked to carry out the BDA - since we were only around 500m away. So we headed up there, and as soon as we crossed into the field he was in, behind compound 13, I pinged him. White dish dash, 50 meters North of the tree line we were moving up, in the middle of the field. **** was still moving! 138 30mm rounds hadn't finished him off. I expected him to be in bits! So we drew level with him and went firm, then me and Marine A moved out to him, covering each other a bound at a time, as the others provided our protection. He was down and hanging out but still moving, I said as much to Marine A, as well as I had a headshot, but we cracked on up to him - I'd expected to brass him up there and then, but I followed Marine A's lead. We got to him, and he was in a very bad way, first we did the standard checks, Marine A searched... him, then jumped on him and rolled him over to check under him for any nasties. PGSS had us in full view, as did AH so Marine A was playing it straight. We recovered an old hanging out AK, with 2 mags, as well as a HE Grenade - sneaky ****. Next he started assessing his wound, while I had my pistol drawn on his head in case he tried anything; any excuse to pop him I would, piece of ****. I wanted to slot him bad, but Marine A said no due to the PGSS feed - goes direct live back to Bastion, could wind me up on a Murder charge. As I said before, he was ****** up though his brain just hadn't caught up with his body - he was dead, but he just didn't know it yet. The HE/Incendiary rounds the AH use has fragged up his entire left side, head to toe, and he has 2 or 3 nasty ones up his back - having sucking chest wounds you could have fit 3 fingers in - his lungs and **** hanging out. I felt no pity for him though, **** had just been shooting up our boys at TALANDER and god knows what before that. So once we'd searched and de-armed him, a couple of lads came over to drag him out of the middle of the fields, as we were mega exposed, and into the treeline... everyone else was firm in. This also meant we were out of the watchful eye of the PGSS balloon. Initially Marine A had sent up that this worthless piece of **** was alive, rightly or wrongly, but wasn't keen to call a MERT out; he was nearly dead anyway, don't think he'd of pulled through. Now we were in cover, I was ready and waiting to pop him with a 9mm, one in the heart should do it, but I waited out for the nod from Marine A, kept pressing the point and although for one minute I thought we were actually going to treat and casivac him, Marine A squashed it and sent it up that he'd snuffed it while we treated him. So there I was, pistol drawn, waiting for Marine A to get off the net so I could pop this little **** and be done with it; when Marine A came back over, and thinned me out, to take up arcs with the others. As I walked off towards **** ****, Marine A popped him one himself! I felt mugged off, but job done, little **** was dead at the end of the day. We got some DNA off him, then headed back in. I was pretty threaders; not because I hadn't got to finish him off myself, as he was dead either way, and I'd have gained nothing from it, although I wanted to, maybe just for self satisfaction. I just felt a little mugged off. Still end result was a good one = 1 x dead Taliban **** bag, 1 x AK, 2 x Mags and 1 x Grenade off the streets. Result: NEMESIS x1.

A man desperately searching for a kidney donor for his wife has still not found a match after a year of wandering the streets looking for a stranger who might be willing to donate. Larry Swilling, from South Carolina, made headlines last September when he walked 250 miles wearing a sandwich board with the message 'NEED KIDNEY 4 WIFE'. While a number of kind-hearted donors have offered to help, none of them has yet provided a match and his wife Jimmie Sue remains on dialysis. Loyal husband: Larry Swilling's devotion to his wife led him to walk the streets with a signboard asking for an organ donor . In need: Larry has taken his cause across the community in search of a donor match for his wife . Mr Swilling, 78, has received calls . from as far away as Sweden and Egypt, but the difficulties of organ . donation mean that the saga of his wife's health is not yet over. Mrs Swilling, 76, was born with just . one kidney, and ever since it started failing last year she has been . looking for a replacement. 'I've had calls from miles around,' Mr Swilling told the Daily News. 'I've had calls from Egypt, Sweden, all over.' He has carried on working at a construction firm to support the couple and help pay for his wife's medication. Forever love: Jimmie Sue, left, and Larry Swilling have been married for 57 years . in sickness and in health: Jimmie Sue, left, was born with only one kidney but now she needs a transplant . 'She's my everything,' he told Fox News. 'We've been married 57 years. She's my life.' Despite the debilitating effects of . dialysis, Mrs Swilling is in generally good health, and doctors say that . a successful kidney transplant could bring an end to her medical . problems. However, staff at the Medical . University of South Carolina say that finding a suitable donor has been . difficult despite the positive reaction to Mrs Swilling's story. 'Finding a match is a huge, huge . process,' nurse Sara Parker told Fox News. 'There's so many different . components and several things can rule you out along the way. 'There's blood and tissue that you . have to match. And it has to be a very healthy person who can go through . the surgery and live on one kidney post-operatively.' Donor: As her loving husband, Larry was tested but was not found to be a donor match for his wife . At any cost: Larry told CBS News that he can't imagine life without his wife and he will do anything to find her a kidney . Mr Swilling had been hoping to donate a . kidney to his wife himself, but neither he nor any of their three . children have the right blood type. 'She's my heart,' he told CBS News last year about his quest to find an organ donor for his wife. Jimmie Sue is on a donor list but that could take as long as three years. In . a last ditch effort, he decided to plead with strangers for help. 'I . don't care what people think,' he said, telling his wife 'I'm going to . get you a kidney.' Help: Larry walks with his signboard across the community to broadcast his need . One mission: Larry says he doesn't care what people think of him asking strangers for help . He has taken to the sidewalks and streets of his hometown of Anderson and has even traveled to neighboring communities. Wearing a signboard that reads 'Need Kidney 4 Wife,' he walks up and down busy streets to see if anyone would help. 'If I get a kidney, fine. If I don't, I hope someone else does,' Mrs Swilling said. Donations are being collected for a fund to help the Swillings.

St George Wharf, Vauxhall, pictured in 2007. But the view across London from the Houses of Parliament will be changed forever when five new skyscrapers are completed . St George's Tower - which stands at 180 metres - is near completion. One of the newest, at 594-ft, it made headlines when a helicopter crashed into the crane used to build it, killing two people . The 168metre tower  - designed by U.S architects Kohn Pederson Fox -   will be 50 storeys high, and will contain around 350 private flats and penthouses. The Evening Standard reports that the flats will have winter gardens, terraces or roof gardens alongside communal lounges and a gym. There will be a separate 23 storey . block, which will contain around 100 'affordable homes' - a mixture of . reduced rent and shared ownership accommodation. A . four-storey horizontal office element will link the two buildings, and . at the ground floor there will be shops, cafes and public areas and . parkland. Three other towers will also feature - . One Nine Elms (200 metres high) and Vauxhall Square which will have twin . towers up to 165 metres high. The next, the New Bondway Tower, was unveiled at a public exhibition in Vauxhall at the weekend by joint developers McLaren Property and Citygrove . It comes after it was announced that one of Britain's most iconic skyscrapers could be outstripped by a £1 billion tower - just 23ft taller. A 75-storey residential block is planned within spitting distance of London's One Canada Square, better known as the Canary Wharf tower - which was Britain's tallest building for 20 years. It will be the highest residential building in western Europe, holding more than 700 luxury apartments with breathtaking views over the capital. Irish property magnate Tom Ryan is behind the plans after his firm Ryan Corporation (UK) bought the east London site for £100m. It already has planning permission for the tower but the scheme was put under review during the recession. Mr Ryan is set to enter talks with Tower Hamlets council to change the tower from a mix of offices, homes and a hotel to an exclusive housing-only block whose 714 apartments will cost a staggering £1,600 per square foot.","New towers are under construction at the southern end of Vauxhall Bridge .

Ministers have been accused of sacrificing centuries of English shipbuilding to placate Scottish voters before next year’s independence referendum. The Ministry of Defence announced yesterday that warship construction will end at Portsmouth – home of the Royal Navy since the days of the Mary Rose and Sir Francis Drake – in order to save shipyards on the Clyde. Defence giant BAE Systems announced that it was cutting 1,775 jobs. Some 940 shipyard workers – along with 170 agency workers – will be laid off in Portsmouth, where ships will undergo maintenance. Job cuts: The Ministry of Defence has announced that warships will no longer be manufactured in Portsmouth dockyard, pictured . Naval ships are seen docked at the HM Naval Base in Portsmouth dockyard, the Portsmouth home of BAE Systems . End of an era: Warships will no longer be built at Portsmouth pictured - an announcement that has seen ministers accused of trying to placate Scottish voters ahead of next year's independence referendum . Job losses: Another 835 jobs will be lost at yards in Govan (pictured) and Scotstoun on the Clyde in Glasgow, at Rosyth in Fife and at the firm¿s Filton office near Bristol . Another 835 jobs will be lost at yards in Govan and Scotstoun on the Clyde in Glasgow, at Rosyth in Fife and at the firm’s Filton office near Bristol. However, the Clyde yards won a contract for three offshore patrol vessels to keep them active until the building of a new generation of Type-26 frigates. David Cameron’s official spokesman claimed the Portsmouth dockyard was losing out ‘in the UK national interest’ and repeatedly failed to deny that the decision to prop up the Scottish yards was influenced by the referendum. In a clear signal that Scottish political considerations were part of the equation, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond made it clear that the frigates contract would be stripped from Scotland if voters chose to leave the United Kingdom. ‘The UK has not – except during the two world wars – ever placed orders for complex warships outside the UK, and I don’t anticipate that the UK would wish to do that in the future,’ he said. ‘I think there’s something there that people in Scotland need to think about very carefully.’ But critics warned that the closure of Portsmouth would rob England of its expertise to build the new frigates if there was a Yes vote in Scotland. Going home: Shipworkers leave the BAE systems yard at Govan on the river Clyde in Glasgow tonight . Still going: The Clyde yards won a contract for three offshore patrol vessels to keep them active until the building of a new generation of Type-26 frigates . Threat: In a clear signal that Scottish political considerations were part of the equation, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond made it clear that the frigates contract would be stripped from Scotland if voters chose to leave the United Kingdom . Caroline Dinenage, Tory MP for Gosport, said: ‘Scottish jobs have been protected at the expense of those on the South coast.’ BAE Systems and the MoD said the cuts were necessary because shipbuilding work was declining as the construction of two aircraft carriers neared completion. David Cameron was consulted, but the issue was not discussed in full at the National Security Council, where strategic decisions are supposed to be taken. Speaking out: The decision on where the Type 26 frigates will be built will not be made until the end of next year, after the Scottish referendum in September, but Mike Hancock, the Lib Dem MP for Portsmouth South, pictured, said that could be too late . To plug the gap between the completion of the aircraft carriers in 2015, the MoD said it would commission three offshore patrol vessels to play ‘a key role in counter-terrorism, counter-piracy and anti-smuggling operations’. Work on the vessels is due to begin next year in Scotland, with the first ship being delivered to the Royal Navy in 2017. Shortly after 10am yesterday, workers in Portsmouth were told to attend a meeting with BAE bosses who told them they could apply for voluntary redundancy, retrain or be redeployed to Govan. Painter Jim Wheatcroft, 33, the father of four daughters under 10, has worked at the yard for 17 years. ‘It’s definitely a political decision,’ he said. ‘It’s disgusting. They don’t care about us.’ Shipbuilder James Jackson, 45, from Birkenhead, Merseyside, said: ‘The mood in the room was sour and bitter. They have kept us in the dark for so long and now, just before Christmas, they’ve told us we are going to lose out jobs.’ The decision on where the Type 26 frigates will be built will not be made until the end of next year, after the Scottish referendum in September, but Mike Hancock, the Lib Dem MP for Portsmouth South, said that could be too late. ‘Five hundred years of tradition is going to be swept away,’ he said. ‘If the referendum went against the UK government then it would be very hard to replace what we’ve taken apart in Portsmouth. It’s a very foolish government that puts all its eggs into one basket.’ For more than 800 years, Portsmouth’s proud shipbuilding tradition has played a key role in Britain being a major naval power. In 1194, Richard I – Richard the Lionheart –  built the first dock. Under Henry VII, it grew as a naval base and the world’s first dry dock was constructed there in 1495. His son, Henry VIII – regarded as the founder of the modern navy – added at least 85 ships to the fleet and made Portsmouth its main base. Work on his flagship the Mary Rose began in 1509 and she was later refitted to become the first British warship to have a complete lower deck of guns with hinged ports. Ruling the waves: A battleship for the Royal Navy is launched at Portsmouth in 1899 . In the 18th century, the dockyard, with its engineering and armament yards, was the largest industrial complex in the world. The first iron-hulled warship, HMS Warrior, was built in 1860, ushering in a new wave of shipbuilding. The revolutionary HMS Dreadnought, launched in 1905 by King Edward VII, gave its name to a new type of battleship. During the First World War, 1,658 ships were docked for refit or repair in Portsmouth as personnel numbers rose to 23,000 and for the first time women were employed at the yard. After the war, construction continued but was limited to cruisers and smaller ships. By 1937, numbers had declined to 15,000. Some 2,550 ships were docked at Portsmouth during the Second World War, but the yard suffered major bomb damage and the Royal Navy’s larger ships were moved to ports further north. Numbers employed rose to a record 27,000. After the war, Portsmouth built only destroyers and frigates. The 2,860-ton frigate HMS Andromeda, completed in 1967, was the last of nearly 300 ships entirely built at the dockyard. The renaissance of shipbuilding came in 2006 with the launch of the £80million, 1,300-ton offshore patrol vessel, HMS Clyde. The dockyards were bought by BAE Systems in 2009 and projects included building a 7,000-ton midship section, 5,000-ton stern section and control towers for aircraft carriers HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales. The Portsmouth Historic Dockyard attraction is home to HMS Victory, in which Nelson set sail from the city before the battle of Trafalgar in 1805, HMS Warrior and the Mary Rose. She sank in the Solent in 1545 as she led an attack on the French fleet. The wreck was salvaged in 1982 and finally went on display last May. Labour defence spokesman Vernon Coaker said: ‘Britain must retain a sovereign ship-building capability. None of us want to see Scotland leave the United Kingdom, but we need clarity from the Government about what safeguards are in place to meet all eventualities after next year’s referendum.’ Gerald Vernon-Jackson, leader of Portsmouth Council, said: ‘I condemn the decision to shut down the last remaining shipyard in England with the capability to build advanced surface warships. ‘This decision is bad for Portsmouth, with the loss of many highly skilled jobs, but it’s also bad for the defence of the UK and for the Royal Navy.’ Scots have developed a ‘sense of victimhood’ after the collapse of their heavy industries, one of the country’s most senior judges said yesterday. In a lecture at Lincoln’s Inn, Supreme Court judge Lord Sumption said the push for independence was a result of the failure of Scotland’s steel, shipbuilding and heavy engineering industries and the state takeover of its economy.","MoD announced that warship construction will end at Portsmouth, Hants .

More than 800,000 people will be 'lifted out of fuel poverty' overnight because of a change in the way figures are calculated. However, the Government has been accused of 'shifting the goalposts' by manipulating the number of households classed as in fuel poverty with amendments to the Energy Bill. The changes will mean that 2.4 million people are now classed as fuel poor instead of 3.2 million, but critics claim that in reality this is nothing more than a change in the definition to improve statistics. More than 800,000 people will be 'lifted out of fuel poverty' overnight because of a change in the way figures are calculated . A report from the Commons Environmental Audit Committee pointed out that currently families fall into the category if they spend more than 10 per cent of income on fuel 'to maintain an adequate level of warmth'. But the new indicator would mean they were only regarded as in hardship if they have 'above average fuel costs' that would leave them with 'a residual income below the official poverty line'. Joan Walley, who chairs the cross-party committee, said: 'The Government is shifting the goalposts on fuel poverty so that official statistics record far fewer households as fuel-poor. 'The changes to the fuel poverty definition and target, in part being made through amendments to the Energy Bill, should be stopped unless the Government is prepared to make a public commitment to end fuel poverty altogether.' The Government has been accused of 'shifting the goalposts' and manipulating the number of households classed as in fuel poverty, with amendments to the Energy Bill . Ms Walley warned that the coalition's shake-up of green levies - intended to shave £50 off average annual bills - could end up hitting fuel poor households. 'A short-term bid to cut bills must not throw energy and climate change policy off-course,' she said. 'In the longer term green levies could actually keep bills down if they drive energy efficiency improvements that cut the cost of heating our homes. 'Insulating homes and supporting green technologies is vital to help the fuel poor and cut the emissions causing climate change.' The committee also looked at plans for the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant, and concluded the government was not right to argue that it was not subsidising the project. 'New nuclear is being subsidised and the Coalition should come clean and admit it,' Ms Walley said. 'The Government cannot escape that clear fact by talking about ""support mechanisms"" and 'insurance policies' instead of ""subsidies"".'","Amendments to Energy Bill will see 2.4m 'fuel poor' instead of 3.2m .

A man used his 'passing' relationship with footballer Ashley Cole to tempt two jewellers to a hotel with bags full of diamonds and watches before robbing them, a court has heard. Barry 'Junior' Eaton, 33, is accused of telling Dean Magri and Christopher Agathocleous that Chelsea footballer Cole wanted to meet them at the Verta Hotel in Battersea to buy luxury jewellery on January 29. However, when the two men arrived at the hotel Cole failed to appear. They then went outside, where Eaton, along with his friend Raphael Francis, 23, allegedly beat and robbed them. Barry Eaton, 33, (left) is accused of used his 'passing' relationship with Ashley Cole to set up a meeting with two jewellers at a hotel in South London before allegedly robbing them along with Raphael Francis, 23 (right) The men were wearing balaclavas and brandishing a fake handgun. Francis was arrested by police officers at the scene, while Eaton was taken in for questioning the day after and later charged. Mr Agathocleous's blue leather Hugo Boss bag, containing Rolex diamond bracelets, several loose diamonds, a Casio diamond watch, diamond rings, diamond earrings and a diamond pendant was recovered. However Magri's bag, containing six designer watches worth £110,000, was never found. According to the prosecution, Eaton discussed the possibility of buying jewellery with Cole's 'gatekeeper' but was told the footballer wasn't interested . Opening the case at Kingston Crown Court, prosecutor Luke Ponte said: 'These two men thought they were going to meet a new customer. They thought they were going to meet a very valuable new customer. 'They thought they were going to meet Ashley Cole - who most of you will know as the England and Chelsea footballer, and the rest if you will know as Cheryl's ex. 'They thought they were going to meet him to sell some jewellery because Mr Eaton, in the dock, knew Mr Cole and told them might be in the market for some jewellery. 'But they weren’t going to meet Ashley Cole. They were going to be assaulted and robbed by young men with covered faces, one of whom produced what looked like a handgun. 'The Crown says that Mr Eaton set up the robbery and Mr Francis was one of the robbers.' The court heard Eaton had contacted Cole’s ‘gatekeeper’ Mohammed Ayub about some expensive gems weeks before the robbery. Mr Ponte said: 'Police spoke to Mohammed Ayub, who works as a driver and personal assistant for Ashley Cole. 'You will hear from Mr Ayub that one of the crosses that professional footballers bear, along with a weekly £250,000 salary, is that all sorts of people pester them for all sorts of reasons. 'It is sensible to have some sort of gatekeeper, and for Ashley Cole it is Mr Ayub. If you want to get to Ashley, you go through him first. 'He will tell you that he has known Mr Eaton for two years. He sees him at clubs and occasionally chats to him on the phone or has Blackberry conversations with him. 'He remembers Mr Eaton mentioning, around three weeks before the robbery, he had a contact that could show Ashley Cole some jewellery. Mr Magri worked for Farringdon's (left), while Mr Agathocleous had no shop and loaned his items from other jewellers. The men travelled to the Verta Hotel in Battersea (right) where they expected to meet Ashley Cole . 'He told Mr Eaton that Ashley has his own jewellery designer and didn’t think he would be interested. 'Mr Ayub did not arrange any meeting with Mr Eaton nor has he ever seen any photos of jewellery sent by Mr Eaton.' The court heard Mr Agathocleous, a friend of Eaton, caters for high end clientele and that Mr Magri specialised in expensive watches. He said: 'Mr Margi works at Hatton Cross Jewellers called Farringdons. He specialised in high-end watches. He and Mr Agathocleous had been friends for five years. 'Mr Agathocleous is also a friend of Barry Eaton. Like most people, he knew Mr Eaton by his nickname ‘Junior.’ 'Mr Margi had never met Mr Eaton before the night of the meeting.' Mr Ponte added that Mr Agathocleous loaned the items he brought from other jewellers and was not insured. Eaton and Francis, both from Norwood, South London, deny two counts of robbery and one count of having an imitation fire arm. Francis is also denies actual bodily harm on a police officer.

Police are hunting for this armed robber who they believe is behind four shop raids in the last two months . Police are hunting an armed robber wearing a 'Chucky' mask who is thought to have raided four shops in the last two months. Shopkeepers in Scunthorpe, North Lancashire, are fearful they could be targeted next by the man, who has terrified people by wearing the horror movie mask as he brandishes a gun. Moves have been made by the police to reassure locals that everything possible is being done to catch the man who speaks with a foreign accent and wears a distinctive Adidas tacksuit. However, he has remained at large since October when he carried out his first robbery and has gone on to get away with two more since, though failed on another occasion to get anything after the owner fought him off. During the first robbery, on October 16, the man got away with cash and cigarettes after asking the female cashier to hand them over. On November 8 he made off with more cash after threatening a man with a firearm, but failed on his third attempt a week later, when he was also armed with a handgun. On that occasion the shop owner had been locking up at around 9pm when the armed robber tried to get into the shop. However, after a brief tussle the man managed to lock himself inside and the masked man ran off. In the final raid, which happened on Sunday at a Sainsbury's petrol station, the man escaped again after demanding money. Two men, aged 21 and 24, have been arrested but are on bail until December pending further investigation. Detective inspector James Fairgrieve, of Humberside Police said: 'There are people out there who know who this person is and I am now asking those people to please come forward and speak to police as a matter of urgency. 'The man in the ‘Chucky’ mask has been . targeting a number of commercial properties in North Lincolnshire and . police are carrying out thorough investigations to identify him, however . we need the help of the public to please provide us with as much . information as possible.' The man, who brandished a gun during two of the crimes, is described as speaking in a foreign accent . 'The man has got away with cash from a number of the stores and thankfully nobody was injured. He continued: 'I want to reassure the public that police are doing all they can to identify this man and we will not stop until he is arrested and brought into police custody.' Chucky was made famous by horror film series Child's Play which featured the soul of a serial killer trapped inside the body of a children's doll.

A former Santa Barbara undersheriff who resigned in October has been accused of having a Fifty Shades Of Grey-style affair with a Search and Rescue spokeswoman. Valerie Walston claims she was sexually harassed by Jim Peterson who asked her to use the names Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey, the characters from E L James' trilogy, during their relationship. In a lawsuit filed on November 15, Walston says Peterson, who retired suddenly for 'personal reasons', sent her 11,500 explicit texts, explicit photographs and promised her a promotion if she slept with him. Write caption here . However, the job offer never materialised and Walston claims she was demoted and eventually fired from her 'dream job' after she ended the relationship. Walston claims the tryst constitutes sexual harassment because she only consented after fearing Peterson would damage her career if she refused. According to the Santa Barbara Independent, Walston joined the Search and Rescue Team in 2010 and was made spokeswoman, and in 2012 applied for a job as the Sheriff Department's public information officer when she met Peterson. According to her complaint the next time she met Peterson was three weeks later at a conference when he told her she looked beautiful but told her she hadn't got the job, after which she left the event crying. The pair swapped professional emails afterwards, with Walston messaging first to apologise for being upset, but soon she alleges Peterson began sending flirty messages and innuendos. Walston says the pair swapped mobile numbers and over the course of 12 months exchanged 11,500 texts in which he sent her 'extremely sexually explicit' messages and asked her 'to speak French to him'. She alleges the pair made Bill Brown - the name of Peterson's superior - their safe word in case anything he said upset her, but she didn't stop the conversation for fears about her job. Peterson allegedly sent her pictures of himself 'in different states of sexual arousal' and she sent some images back. After she voiced concerns about him being married and her having a boyfriend, Walston says he responded: 'My wife and I have an arrangement and understanding. Hahahaha.' Call me Christian: in her complaint Walston says Peterson asked her to use Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey instead of their real names in reference to E L James' erotic novel . According to the lawsuit the pair then met in secluded locations including car parks in order to drink and 'kiss, grope, and fondle each other'. One one occasion Walston says she even met Peterson in his suite during the California Undersheriff Conference. However in July Walston was told Peterson had lied to her about the information officer role she was applying for, after which she handed the messages and nude photos to her superiors and an investigation was launched. Shortly afterwards, in September, Walston's job was eliminated and she was made into a marketing officer, before being let go on October 22. Concluding the claim, her lawyer Gerry Tetalman said: 'Ms. Walston’s ""termination"" on October 22, 2013, was clearly pretextual due to the fact that she was forced to engage in a sexual relationship with Mr. Peterson. 'Finally, as a result of everything that has happened, she has also been blackballed in the community and lost everything that she had held so dear to her.' According to the claim's cover sheet, Walston is seeking 'well in excess' of $10,000 (£6,100). On October 14 Peterson handed in his notice, and left his 30-year career in law enforcement just two days later, after serving two and a half years as undersheriff.

Mrs Skinner said they had changed their names once they arrived in England, with Rancadore posing as Marc Skinner. The pair moved to the capital after two acquittals for Mafia activity in 1987, saying they wanted to 'get away' from their surname, infamous in Italy because Rancadore's father was a feared boss of the Sicilian Costa Nostra. They arrived with their two children, Giuseppe, now 36, and Daniela, now 33. Granting conditional bail at Westminster Magistrates' Court, Judge Riddle said: ‘The most recent behaviour complained about was over 18 years ago. ‘My colleagues who refused bail earlier had ample grounds to do so. However, over 14 weeks have passed and the extradition hearing is listed in February, which is over six months after arrest. Admission: Anne and Daniela Skinner leave Westminster Magistrates Court. Mrs Skinner, posted £50,000 cash in surety and Rancadore was told if he is released he will be under house arrest and have to wear an electronic tag . ‘There is no evidence put before me to suggest he had offended here or abroad in the last 18 years.’ After the ruling Rancadore, who had been holding a white bible throughout, blew a kiss to his wife. Rancadore’s father, Giuseppe, was imprisoned as part of the notorious maxi trial in 1987 which saw 475 Mafiosi indicted. Since fleeing from authorities, Anne claims the family have been running an executive travel agency, but that all of their clients have deserted them since Rancadore's arrest. Italian authorities say Rancadore served as 'a man of honour' in the Cosa Nostra, collecting bribes from builders in Trabia near Palermo between December 1987 and April 1995.

Mike Freer has accidentally sent an email to protesters in which he called them 'numb-nuts' and the police 'daft' A Tory MP has called police 'daft' and branded demonstrators 'numb-nuts' in an email accidentally sent to a protest camp on his own doorstep. The email was reportedly meant for a member of Mike Freer's staff but he accidentally copied in members of the Occupy group who were camped on the driveway of his constituency office. Mr Freer, MP for Finchley and Golders Green, has been involved in a week-long standoff with six activists who are opposed to his anti-squatters stance. They had been outside his office on Ballards Lane, Finchley - Margret Thatcher's former constituency HQ - since Friday last week but have since been evicted. According to reports, Mr Freer's staff initially allowed them to camp there to stop them blocking the pavement outside, but became frustrated and eventually hired bailiffs to remove them. According to the Evening Standard, the email said: 'I am mightily peed off at the Police. I feel like sending the Bill to the Commissioner saying your fat advice landed us with the Bill. 'Of course this will inhibit every other demo as we will simply refuse to allow anyone onto our property. So tempting to say — you are all numb-nuts as I am not the owner of the property and it is they you should be dealing with about your presence.' The 'bill' refers to the cost of hiring the private bailiffs used in the eviction. Mr Freer helped to draft a bill which made squatting in residential building a criminal offence, a law which the protesters oppose. Six protesters, including Dominic and Steven Quinn (pictured) were camping outside MP Mike Freer's office until they were evicted yesterday morning by bailiffs . Protester Pete Phoenix, 43, said: 'It isn’t a nice way to refer to your constituents. We have been politely co-operating with the police and we have been very respectful in our protest. 'We weren’t trespassing as he gave us permission. He has been disrespectful to people trying to have their say.' The group, who have now moved across the road, say they plan to stay until Mr Freer joins them for a night to discuss their concerns. It is understood the MP had previously emailed them and asked to meet, an offer they had agreed to. The email was accidentally sent to them instead of being sent to a member of Mr Freer's staff . Speaking about the camp, Mr Freer said: 'The squatters and the camp were disrupting my constituency office and its presence was intimidating. 'A polite request for the squatters to leave was ignored as were instructions on how to arrange an appointment. It was decided that we had no alternative but to lawfully remove the squatters from the property.' Last night 50 activists joined a demonstration at the new camp which was broadcast online. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said the force would not comment on the email. Mr Freer's office has previously said it would not be commenting on the message, and calls from Mail Online were not immediately answered.","MP Mike Freer accidentally emailed protesters on his own doorstep .

Distraught: Navpreet Walia, 40, burned his estranged wife's £68,000 estate, the Court of Appeal heard . A widower who set fire to his estranged wife's £68,000 estate after she died of cancer is being sued by her new lover for a share of the cash. Navpreet Walia, 40, could be left homeless after he 'literally burned' the cash in a fit of grief, in a case which has been compared to Charles Dickens' tragic courtroom drama Bleak House. Mr Walia's wife Jocelyn was 38 when she died of cancer without leaving a will. That meant Mr Walia, from Thornton-Cleveleys, Lancashire, automatically inherited everything she owned despite her leaving him several years earlier for a new partner. When she died her 'articulate and intelligent' husband was so upset that he drew out tens of thousands of pounds in cash and torched it all, a court heard. The assets included her half . share of a £130,000 life insurance policy and the equity in the home . the couple once shared. Her new partner, Felipe Lim, claimed he and Mrs Walia's two children were entitled to a share of the estate and sued him last year at Manchester High Court, which ruled all three were entitled to 'reasonable provision'. Mr Walia appeared to fight that ruling yesterday at London's Court of Appeal, where details of the case were aired for the first time. Simon Charles, for Mr Lim and the . children, said: 'It has been admitted frankly that the money has been . burnt. This is conduct that one should bear in mind when considering . whether to grant Mr Walia the indulgence which he seeks.' Mr Charles accepted bank records tallied with Mr Walia's story but added: 'My . clients have some difficulty accepting that the money has gone. 'Mr . Walia says the money has been burnt. If the money has been burnt, it . doesn’t stop a judgment being entered against other assets held by Mr . Walia.' Lord Justice Davis gave Mr Walia . permission to appeal - on condition that he signs a . sworn statement within ten days 'giving details of exactly how, where and when the . money was literally burnt.' The judge added: 'This is a relatively . modest estate. All this has turned this family tragedy into a modern day . version of Jarndyce and Jarndyce. 'Mr . Walia has suffered significant bereavements in the last year or so; not . only his wife had died but [other family members] have been lost. 'There . is some evidence he has been suffering from a significant depressive . illness [although] he is clearly an articulate and intelligent man.' The judge's allusion to 'Jarndyce and Jarndyce' was a reference to Bleak House, Charles Dickens' masterpiece story of a family at war. The case was compared to warring family members in Dickens' Bleak House (pictured in a BBC version) Bleak: Mr Walia told London's Court of Appeal, pictured, that he could lose his home if he has to repay the cash . The fictional family battled so bitterly over a relative's will that by the time a judge decided who should win the money, it had been completely swallowed in lawyers' fees. The court heard Mr and Mrs Walia wed in July 2003 and had a . daughter, Emma, now eight, before Mrs Walia left their home in Lancaster to form a new relationship. She moved in with her new partner Mr Lim and had her son Philip, now four. Describing the case as 'somewhat unusual', Mr Walia’s counsel, Neil Vickery, told the judge that the widower could lose his home if he has to pay back the burnt cash. When asked if he had burnt the money because he was upset at his wife’s death, Mr Walia said outside court: 'Yes, I was more than upset, but I don’t want to say any more about it at the moment. I’ll put it all down in the affidavit for the judge.' If Mr Walia does not file the affidavit within the 10-day deadline, his appeal will automatically be dismissed.

A Christmas price war has been triggered by IKEA which is offering six foot trees for just £25, which come with a £20 money-off voucher. The deal, which effectively brings the price down to £5 a tree, threatens to snatch a huge amount of trade from garden centres, which typically charge £40 to £50. It will also be a big blow to British growers, who yesterday delivered the traditional Christmas tree to Downing Street for the festive season. Tumbling price: IKEA is offering Christmas trees for just £25 together with a £20 money-off voucher . Blow: The imported Fir trees could cripple British growers, who provided Downing Street's tree yesterday . IKEA is offering thousands of the Nordmann Fir trees from Denmark, plus some from Scotland, for the loss-leader promotion, which is designed to drum up trade both before Christmas and in in its New Year sale. The deal is expected to generate long queues in the car parks at IKEA stores, which are already difficult to get to and through at the best of times. The decision could also turn around a fall in demand for real trees in recent years, with people switching to increasingly lifelike artificial versions or arty options, such as the popular designer paper tree from John Lewis. Research for the Swedish retailer suggests British families spend a staggering £150 million a year on real Christmas trees. It found that the average price for a six foot tree with non-drop needles is £48. However, families in some parts of the country are paying as much as £79.99. Decline: Prices has risen as fewer buyers visit country estates and small-scale growers to pick up trees . It said the city with the highest average price was Southampton at £60, ahead of Birmingham at £56, Warrington at £54, and both London and Thurrock at £52. The cheapest average was Leeds at £40, ahead of Nottingham at £41, Manchester at £43, Cardiff at £44 and Glasgow at £44. Historically, IKEA allowed outside companies to sell their own trees in the car parks of its stores. However, the chain first began offering its own cheap trees last year with the result it ended up with a glut and found it necessary to virtually give them away. In the final days before Christmas it was selling £25 trees for £7.50 and offering customers a £20 voucher. If the customer used the voucher, they were effectively getting a free IKEA tree and £12.50 to spend. Birgit Hartelius, the deputy country sales manager for IKEA in the UK and Ireland, said: ‘There’s something really special about having a real tree in the home during the festive season, but over the years we’ve seen prices rocket to a level that a lot of people just can’t afford.' The Christmas tree offer is not valid at certain IKEA stores in Bristol, Wales, and Croydon, while the £20 voucher has to be used between January 20 and Feb 9.","Trees will cost £25 but come with a £20 voucher for another purchase .

Chancellor George Osborne, pictured yesterday visiting a JCB factory in Rocester, Staffordshire, has been accused of using questionable statistics to claim living standards are rising . George Osborne was accused yesterday of using questionable statistics to claim family living standards are rising. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said voters would be ‘considerably’ worse off at the time of the 2015 election, compared with how they fared in 2010 when the coalition came to power. A childless couple on the median income will have seen their income drop 6.9 per cent from £481 a week in 2010 to £450 a week in 2015. The IFS predicted that the Chancellor will have to slash welfare spending by another £12billion after the next election if he wants to keep the pace of the Government’s deficit reduction programme on course. Failure to fill that black hole will mean that Whitehall departments have to slash spending by 3.7 per cent a year up to March 2019, far deeper savings than the 2.3 per cent a year Mr Osborne has cut by so far. In a further blow to the Chancellor, the IFS said statistics he cited in his Autumn Statement on Thursday to suggest that the disposable income of families are actually rising are ‘not something with which to measure living standards’. Mr Osborne told MPs that official figures for disposable income – the sum families have left after paying essential bills – will rise by 0.5 per cent this year and 1.1 per cent next year. ‘Yes, real household disposable income is rising,’ he said. But the IFS pointed out the statistic Mr Osborne used includes not just household incomes but also the incomes of charities and universities. The think tank said there was ‘something a little bit strange’ about Mr Osborne’s choice of statistic. IFS director Paul Johnson said: ‘It tells us something about household incomes but it should certainly not be used in isolation to measure how they are changing.’ The IFS gave its analysis as a poll showed that more than half of those who saw the Autumn Statement think it was bad for them. Some 60 per cent thought it was good for ‘rich people’ and just 15 per cent said it was good ‘for people like me’. Some 40 per cent said they support Mr Balls’ view that the Chancellor is ‘in denial’ about the cost of living, while only 24 per backed Mr Osborne. The highly respected think tank then backed shadow chancellor Ed Balls’ claims that families are worse off. Mr Balls has claimed the average worker has lost £1,600 a year in earnings after inflation since the coalition came to power. Unpopular: A poll found that only 15% believe the Chancellor's autumn financial statement was good 'for people like me' whereas 60% thought it was good for 'rich people' The IFS said Mr Balls’ measure of living standards is also imperfect since most families judge living standards on what they have left after tax and benefits, rather than simply on their gross incomes used by the shadow chancellor. But Mr Johnson said Labour’s figures were ‘pretty consistent’ with the evidence from survey data on what had happened to household incomes. ‘We do know from household surveys that income fell sharply in 2010 and 2011. It is almost certainly significantly lower now than it was in 2010. And while it should start to grow it will surely still be below its 2010 level by the time we get to the election in 2015.’ Director of The Institute for Fiscal Studies, Paul Johnson, says voters will actually be 'considerably' worse off at the 2015 election compared to 2010 when the coalition came to power . That is helpful for Labour since Ed Miliband and Mr Balls are determined to fight the next election by asking voters whether they are better off than they were in 2015. The IFS warned that deep cuts in public spending are still going to be necessary after the next election, pointing out that just 46 per cent of the cuts Mr Osborne has outlined have taken effect so far. By the end of 2013-14, Whitehall departmental spending will have fallen by just over 8 per cent since the Government’s austerity programme began and without further tax rises or welfare cuts that looks set to rise to 20 per cent by 2018-19. A Treasury spokesman said the Chancellor would not dispute that the statistics he used were imperfect. He said: ‘As the Chancellor said at the Autumn Statement, the effects of the financial crash on family budgets and the cost of living are still being felt. ‘So, where possible, we have found the money to help hard working families by freezing fuel duty, freezing council tax and taking 2.7million people out of tax  by increasing the tax-free  personal allowance.’ Labour frontbenchers yesterday accused Ed Balls of having ‘no plan’ to deal with rising economic growth and said he should be replaced with former chancellor Alistair Darling. Senior sources say the shadow chancellor repeatedly refused demands by members of the shadow cabinet to spell out an economic strategy in the event of a bounce back. Mr Balls was licking his wounds yesterday after his response to the Autumn Statement was widely panned. In his speech Mr Balls went through what one MP called his ‘greatest hits’ of the last three years, denouncing flatlining growth and Mr Osborne’s ‘millionaire’s tax cut’ – but appeared to have little to say about the economy now it is turning around. House prices rose by nearly £14,000 during the last 12 months – and are going up at the fastest pace in more than six years, figures have shown. Mortgage lender Halifax said the value of a typical home hit £174,910 in November, up £13,577 on the same month last year and nearly £2,000 higher than it was back in October. Average prices in the three months to November were 7.7 per cent higher than they were a year earlier, the fastest pace of growth since October 2007. Figures published alongside the Autumn Statement on Thursday show just how lucrative the recovery in the housing market will be for the Chancellor. The Office for Budget Responsibility has predicted that property-related taxes – including stamp duty, inheritance tax and capital gains tax – will total around £155billion between now and 2018-19. That works out as around £71billion more than if the housing market remained flat over the six-year period. Rob Wood, a former Bank of England economist who now works at Berenberg Bank, said that the revival ‘is key to the recovery story’. He went on to say: ‘The booming housing market is a big bonus for George Osborne. It will generate higher tax receipts from the likes of stamp duty. ‘As well as that, the improving housing market is partly behind the rise in confidence in the UK which is boosting spending in shops and VAT receipts.’ But he warned that there was still a risk the housing market could end up ‘getting out of control’ and driving house prices ‘up to their bubble peak’, adding: ‘That is bad news for the medium term.’","The Chancellor told MPs that official .

Writing in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, the report's authors claimed leadership and strategy were 'totally absent' and politicians had 'neglected state policy on child physical activity for decades'. That is despite research showing regular exercise makes children perform better at school, curbs anti-social behaviour and improves their health. The experts also condemned £300 million ploughed into primary school PE in the two years after the Olympics as a 'derisory gesture'. 'It is nearly one year following the . 2012 London Olympics, with political and Olympic bid promises of youth . health and sporting legacies turning rapidly into a distant memory,' they wrote. 'The minimal funding, lack of interest and absence of a child . physical activity strategy strongly support the notion that the state . is failing to act to prevent harm against children and failing to meet . children's basic physical needs, likely to result in the serious . impairment of their health and development. 'This is quite literally indistinguishable from the government's own definition of child neglect.' Inspiration: But the victories of Mo Farah (left) and Jessica Ennis (right) were overshadowed by the report, which said a £300m post-Olympic pot for primary school PE was little more than a 'derisory gesture' The report was written by experts from University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Liverpool John Moores University and the Sydney School of Public Health. Just 21 per cent of girls and 33 per cent of boys aged four to 15 meet minimum levels of physical activity, they said - adding children spend seven to eight hours a day being sedentary. They wrote: 'While physical activity guidelines recommend children to spend at least an hour a day being physically active, schools are able to provide no physical education, optional physical education or limited physical education opportunities. 'Furthermore, a lack of focus, political and public debate on these issues highlights a lack of interest of political parties and education authorities in the physical literacy of our children and future citizens. 'Given the overwhelming evidence supporting physical activity for the physical health, mental health and productivity of children, the lack of policy, lack of cross party debate and interest, lack of leadership and strategic action on physical activity within schools are complicit and tantamount to state child neglect.' The amount of time children spend on PE and sport is neither monitored nor known by the authorities, they said - and there is no statutory minimum time schools must devote to PE. They added that even though Team GB came third in the Olympic medals table, women and men from Britain came first and second, respectively, in Europe's obesity rankings. A Government spokesman said: 'This government is taking decisive action to harness the Olympic spirit and make sure every child has the opportunity to be fit and healthy. 'We have extended our ringfenced funding for primary schools to spend on sport to 2015/16 - with a total of £450m now going directly to headteachers to improve PE and sport in their schools. 'In addition we have spent £3 million to extend Change4Life sports clubs to schools in areas with the highest childhood obesity, we are targeting funding to get more 11 to 25-year-olds playing sport, and we are investing in facilities to strengthen grassroots sport up and down the country.'","Damning report claims fewer than a third of children have basic fitness .

Thailand's political crisis has deepened after its embattled prime minister announced she will dissolve parliament in a surprise televised address. Yingluck Shinawatra . appeared emotional and her voice shook in an emergency broadcast after 100,000 anti-government protesters took to the streets of Bangkok for a 'final showdown'. At least five people have been killed and 289 injured in the latest wave of unrest in Thailand, which has been plagued by turmoil since an army coup in 2006. Emotional: Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra made a surprise emergency TV address saying she will dissolve parliament after 100,000 protestors on the streets of Bangkok threatened to topple the government . Crisis: 100,000 protesters have taken to the streets of Bangkok today to call for the government to end . Protesters waving flags, blowing whistles and shouting anti-government slogans today have blocked the streets and 60 schools have been closed as a precaution. Some have occupied the Finance Ministry and part of a vast government complex for more than a week. There were fears today's protests could end violently when nine groups of demonstrators converge on the prime minister's office. During the broadcast, she said there would be new elections 'as soon as possible, adding: 'After listening to opinions from all sides, I have decided to request a royal decree to dissolve Parliament.' But the move may not halt the country's political stand-off, which deepened yesterday after the main opposition party resigned en masse. Protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban has repeatedly said calling fresh elections would not be enough to end the conflict. Defiant: Thai protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban said people would rise up 'on every street in the country' Fears: As the protests reached a peak today there were fears they could end in violence. Five people have died . Chaos: The column of anti-government protesters has blocked the streets in the Thai capital Bangkok . Suthep, a former deputy prime minister under the previous military-backed government, said the announcement would not stop the march. 'We have not yet reached our goal. The dissolving of parliament is not our aim,' he said. The protest leader was equally defiant yesterday, saying: 'We will rise up. We will walk on every street in the country. We will not be going home again.' Thailand has been plagued by political turmoil since the army toppled Yingluck's brother Thaksin in a 2006 coup. Surprise: Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra during her televised address today . The former leader now lives in self-imposed exile in Dubai to avoid jail . time for a corruption conviction which he says was politically motivated. The Thai elite and the educated middle-class have pitted themselves against Thaksin's power base in the countryside, which benefited from populist policies designed to win over the rural poor. The crisis boiled over last month after . Yingluck's ruling party tried to push through a controversial amnesty bill, which critics said was designed to return Thaksin to power. The violence had only a brief respite last week when both sides paused to celebrate the birthday of the nation's revered king, who turned 86 on Thursday. Today's announcement concerns the . 500-member lower house of parliament, where all 153 representatives of . the opposition Democrat party have resigned. Party . leader Abhisit Vejjajiva claimed the government had become . 'illegitimate', adding: 'The solution to our current problems needs to . start with the showing of responsibility. The prime minister has never . showed any responsibility or conscience.' Yingluck's government came to power in a landslide vote in 2011 that observers said was free and fair. Turmoil: Protesters hold a portrait of the nation's king and a banner reading 'We don't need Thaksin regime' In a speech yesterday, Yingluck said again that she was not trying to cling to power and would be 'happy to resign' if new elections are organised within 60 days and all parties accept the outcome.

David Cameron today visited Norfolk to see for himself the extent of flood damage following last week's huge tidal surge. In Wells-next-the-Sea, the Prime Minister met the residents of homes devastated by a tide which reached the highest level for 60 years. Dozens of businesses were flooded in Wells and nine homes were damaged, despite sea defences which prevented the situation getting worse. Visit: David Cameron talking to members of the Fire Service during a visit to Wells-next-the-Sea, Norfolk . Damage: The Prime Minister with local MP Norman Lamb in a shop which was flooded last week . Smaller communities along the north Norfolk coast suffered even more - in the village of Hemsby, three coastal bungalows fell into the sea. Mr Cameron, who spent last week touring China alongside British business leaders, paid tribute to the emergency services and flood wardens for their response, but said more could be done. 'These were terrible floods and it was a very difficult event but the resilience of people here in Norfolk must be praised,' he told locals. 'The systems worked well, the flood wardens did a brilliant job and the police, fire service, lifeboats and the whole community pulled together. 'This was a bigger flood than 1953 when 24,000 homes flooded - this time only 1,400 homes were flooded. But that's no help for the people whose homes were flooded this time.' Concern: Mr Cameron with RNLI volunteers on the coast at Wells, which was affected by the largest tidal surge in Britain since 1953 . On the waterfront: The Prime Minister poses with the members of the Wells lifeboat crew . The Prime Minister called on insurance companies to pay out promptly, and vowed to ensure that householders had support in restoring their homes. 'There's always more to be done and always lessons to be learned,' Mr Cameron said. 'Whether that's personal flood defences that householders can put in, new flood defences the Government should be funding, or even better working between emergency services and local authorities. 'You can always do more but, if there had been no defences, some 800,000 homes could have been flooded and that shows how far we've come.' North Norfolk MP Norman Lamb, who has helped launch an appeal to assist those affected, escorted Mr Cameron on his visit to Wells. Rescue: Mr Cameron praised the work done by the emergency services during last week's flooding . Plea: The Prime Minister called on insurance companies to pay out promptly for flood damage . They visited the Standard House Chandlery which lost much of its stock as water levels reached four foot inside the store and the Golden Fleece pub on the quay front. Steve Brundall, who runs a restaurant above the pub, said: 'The water came up to the window sill and has damaged the walls, the floors, everything. 'Before the tidal surge we did everything we could to protect the place - we had to drive 30 miles to find sandbags because we couldn't get hold of any locally. 'We're now on the phone constantly to the insurance company, trying to get a pay-out. Hopefully we'll reopen this weekend but it won't be until March that we can have a full re-fit.' Chat: Mr Cameron talking to local police officers in Wells while drinking a mug of tea . Taking stock: The Prime Minister with shop owner John Crooks inspecting the damage in his clothes store . Mike Strong, who co-ordinates the flood response locally, said one obstacle in preparing for the flood had been a 'cry wolf' mentally as locals had become accustomed to regular flood warnings. 'We were going door to door warning people and we were met almost with contempt and derision,' he added. 'There is a tendency towards complacency and, while the flood defences here are very good, people need to be aware that they are only part of the protection. 'The flood has caused a lot of disruption and hardship further along the coast but, if it helps shake that complacency, it could prove a vital wake-up call.' Mr Cameron also visited the town's lifeboat station which was flooded and met RNLI crews.

The 20-year-old also appeared to have his arm in a sling . A Florida man ran from the police and into the jaws of an alligator. When Bryan Zuniga, 20, was pulled over by police in the Tampa Bay area in the early hours of Thursday he ran from the car, Pinellas County Sheriff's Office said. The Tampa Bay area man was found later at a hospital, where he was being treated for alligator bites. He told police that he was attacked by the reptile near a water treatment plant. The alligator left multiple puncture wounds to Zuniga's face, arm and armpit. Police had asked Zuniga, from Pinellas Park, to pull over for failing to maintain a single lane, at 2.50am. When his car stopped however, he jumped out of the passenger door, broke through a fence and disappeared. He has been charged with fleeing police, driving with a suspended or revoked license and resisting an officer without violence. The once endangered alligator has been making a comeback in recent years and can be spotted in most stretches of Florida water. The animals can grow up to 15ft in length and weigh up to 1,000lb. Danger: The once endangered alligator is making a comeback in Florida, where about seven attacks on people a year take place (stock image) They have become so common in Pinellas county that residents have access to a hotline to report any alligators that stray on to their property. Last year there were seven unprovoked alligator attacks on people in Florida, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Zuniga told police that he was bitten in the face and arm during the attack. He was found in St Petersburg General Hospital, Florida, several hours after running from police.

With its 18-carat rose gold casing and a stunning sparkle that comes courtesy of 395 white diamonds, it's safe to say that the Savelli Champagne Diamond phone isn't your average handset. The £35,000 phone is part of a collection so luxurious it leaves Apple's slick new iPhone 5 looking thoroughly cheap and not at all cheerful. Designed by Switzerland's Alessandro Savelli, other phones in the range are crafted from precious metals, jewels and exotic skins. A phone fit for a billionaire: Designer Alessandro Savelli is behind the £35,000 Champagne Diamond mobile . Other luxury features include an ultra-bombé sapphire crystal screen and high-tech android-powered connectivity. But not every phone in the range is sparkling with diamonds. Among the 11 models available is the sleek Black Sport which has a simple inky leather cover, albeit one crafted from alligator skin. And should you have the cash to spare, the phones have gone on sale in the UK at - where else? - luxury department store, Harrods. 'We carefully select the best diamonds . and set them using the ‘serti neige’ or ‘snow setting’ technique,' reveals the brand on its website. 'Stones of differing diameters sit side-by-side, covering the precious metal to enhance the organic curves of each piece. Luxury: Other Savelli models come encased in iguana (left) and python (right) with rose gold fittings .

Swiss watchmaker . Tag Heuer has also created a range of luxury phones, including models . that come encased in exotic skins and decorated with jewels. The Meridiist range, which is sold at Selfridges, includes the Jewellery Pink Sapphire, which is covered in rose alligator skin and is embellished with 47 precious stones. Even more luxurious is the Jewellery Full Diamonds model, which along with white alligator casing, is decked with 211 shimmering white diamonds. Each of the phones in the Meridiist range also comes with a complimentary concierge service, which, according to the brand, can get everything from reservations in the world's most exclusive restaurants to tickets to sold out shows. Precious stones: Tag Heuer's phones come embellished with white diamonds and pink sapphires . Over recent years, pink sapphires have become an increasingly popular part of the jewellers' repertoire. But not everyone is sold on the stones. In her book, Buried Treasure: Travels Through The Jewel Box, author Victoria Finley reveals that the gems aren't quite what they seem. Chemically rubies and sapphires are identical and are both a gemstone variety of the mineral corundum (aluminium oxide). But while sapphires get their colour from trace amounts of other elements such as titanium, copper and magnesium, only rubies contain traces of chromium - the only material to impart a pink or red colour. As a result, writes Finley, while its perfectly possible to get purple, yellow or even green sapphires, there is no such thing as a pink or red one. For jewellers, this creates a problem, as rubies are graded by their colour. Dark 'pigeon's blood' red is considered the most valuable while pale pink is virtually worthless - so much so that unscrupulous dealers will attempt to heat them in a bid to darken the colour, despite a 50 per cent chance that they'll explode instead. So what do you get when you buy a pink 'sapphire'? The answer is a low grade ruby - a classification endorsed by trade bodies such as International Colored Gemstone Association which doesn't recognise pink sapphires. Like brown diamonds, pink sapphires might be pretty, but in reality, they aren't nearly as valuable as you might think.","The handset is the work of Swiss designer Alessandro Savelli .

A second woman who had an extra-marital affair with the Mormon doctor on trial for murdering his wife has testified saying that he talked about ways to kill someone. Anna Walthall took the stand on Wednesday in the ongoing murder trial against Martin MacNeill and she said that she had a six month affair with the married father. Ms Walthall's relationship with MacNeill came months before his relationship with Gypsy Willis, the mistress that he was seeing at the time of his wife Michele's death. 'Pillow talk': Martin MacNeill's former mistress Anna Walthall testified that he told her he knew how to give someone certain drugs and they would die and it would make it look like a natural heart attack . Cold: MacNeill, a doctor, kept his emotions on lockdown during testimony on Wednesday while his daughters frequently cried on the stand as they accused him of killing their mother . Ms Walthall's testimony is particularly relevant because she says that the doctor told her that he knew a way to kill someone and make it look like a natural heart attack. She told the Utah court that during 'pillow talk', MacNeill told her: 'There's something you can give someone that's natural that's a heart attack that's not detectable after they have a heart attack.' That goes directly in line with the prosecution's argument as they allege that MacNeill forced his wife to have a face lift and then he plied her with unnecessary drugs effectively forcing a heart attack. The defense tried to discredit Ms Walthall as a witness by bringing up her former multiple personality diagnosis. She is the second former mistress of MacNeill who has been brought in front of the court, as Willis spent two days on the stand earlier in the week. Today she was just mentioned by three of MacNeill's eight children who were all questioned. All three of the daughters who testified today- Sabrina, 19, Vanessa, 32, and Alexis Somers who now uses her mother's maiden name rather than MacNeill- believe that their father killed their mother in order to pursue his relationship with Willis. Speaking out: Daughter Alexis Somers, who had suspected the affair, also testifies on Wednesday . Warning signs: Alexis Somers, who now uses her mother's maiden name, is a doctor and she questioned why her father was giving her mother so many painkillers in the days leading up to her death . Just days after Michele was found dead in the family's bathtub, Alexis received a phone call from her father saying that he had found a nanny for her younger siblings. She told the court that he started to say that the nanny's name was Jillian and she cut him off. 'You mean Gypsy Jillian Willis? I know that woman and I know that mom was worried about you having an affair with her and you are not to bring her into this home,' Alexis recalled telling her father. 'He got irate. He was screaming at me, ""How dare you, how dare you accuse me?""' The court had never been told that Michele had suspicions about her husband cheating before, but Alexis said that her mother had paid a service to track a phone number that her husband had been calling. That number was registered to Gypsy Jyll Willis. The two other daughters who testified on Wednesday said that  Willis was brought to their Pleasant Grove home just days after their mother, Michele, died in 2007. Other sisters - the MacNeills had eight children - have previously testified that Willis was the doctor's mistress around the time of his wife's death. Heartbroken: Vanessa MacNeill, one of the daughters of a doctor accused of killing his wife in 2007, testified today that she wasn't worried her father was having an affair as the woman was nothing like her mother . Emotional: Vanessa MacNeill is one of four sisters who have testified in the ongoing murder trial . 'She made spaghetti once, and that was the only time she cooked,' said Sabrina, a Utah State University student who was adopted by the family from the Ukraine. 'She didn't do anything.' She added that Willis would go into the father's room late at night and take vacations together - but would leave the house separately to avoid raising suspicions. Vanessa MacNeill, another of the couple's daughters, sobbed as she testified on Wednesday and told juror that she had volunteered to move home and help with her sisters - but her father said no. 'He said that everybody needs to get back to their lives,' Vanessa, 32, said. 'That he was going to hire a nanny… that things needed to get back to normal.' Vanessa was asked to help interview . candidates for the job but only Willis turned up and her father claimed . that all others had canceled, the Deseret News reported. She also said she told her sister, Alexis Somers, not to worry about . the woman after she said she feared she was having an affair with their . father. Testimony: Sabrina MacNeill, 19, said that her father's mistress was hired as a nanny but did little to help . In court: Martin MacNeill, pictured Wednesday, is accused of killing his wife so he could continue the affair . 'I told her not to worry,' Vanessa MacNeill said. 'I was convinced that [Willis] wasn't somebody to worry about, that my dad might be involved with... because she was nothing like my mom.' Vanessa is the biological mother of 12-year-old Ada MacNeill, who found Michele's body on the day she died. The MacNeills adopted Ada, who is expected to testify at a later date. Another of the couple's older . daughters, Alexis Somers, testified Wednesday that Willis would come and . go throughout the day, and seemed more focused on the doctor than the . children. 'I never saw her . pick up the children or do any cooking or cleaning,' Somers said. 'I saw . her follow my dad around a lot. I saw them leaving together often.' Prosecutors . say Martin MacNeill, 57, hounded his wife to get cosmetic surgery so . that he could poison her with prescription drugs as she recovered. She . was found passed out in the bathtub. Mistress: He was having an affair with Gypsy Willis, pictured leaving court on Tuesday, at the time of the death . Picture perfect: Martin and Michele MacNeill, who died in April 2007 after a facelift, had eight children . They say his motive was to get rid of his wife so he could be with Willis. In previous testimony, Willis said she traded text messages with the doctor 30 times that day and that they had been involved in a 'casual' affair for 15 months before the death. She said she texted suggestive photos of herself to him just one day after his wife's funeral - and moved in eight days after that. Within months, he had proposed with a $7,000 ring. Defense lawyers argue Michele MacNeill had a heart attack and fell into the tub in April 2007 in their home in Pleasant Grove, about 35 miles south of Salt Lake City. No witness saw how she got in the tub or how she ended up taking the pills. The trial is in its eighth day and it is expected to run through mid-November.","Former mistress Anna Walthall testified that Martin MacNeill told her that he knew how to make it look like someone had a heart attack .

A vicar claims he will have to leave the country after his Eastern European wife was denied a visa on 'language grounds' - even though she’s an English teacher. Reverend Elwyn Phillips, 55, is quitting the UK and moving to Ukraine to be with his wife Lesya, 36. The couple married earlier this year and were making plans to live in his parish at Cwmbran, South Wales. Visa row: Vicar Elwyn Phillips, 55 says he is being forced to leave the country after his Eastern European wife Lesya was denied a visa on 'language grounds' - despite being an English teacher . But immigration bosses barred her from entering Britain saying she was not able to meet the minimum English language requirements. University educated Lesya is a qualified teacher and gives English lessons in her home city of Kiev. Now Rev Phillips is going to move to 1,300 miles and set up home in the Eastern European country. The clergyman said: 'Lesya’s English is flawless - she obviously has an accent but everyone understands her. 'I just couldn’t believe it when they said she cannot live here on language grounds, it’s ridiculous. 'People from the European Union can come here without being able to speak a word of English. 'Yet you have someone who can speak the language rejected - it just seems so unjust.' Wedding day: Elwyn and Lesya on their wedding day had planned to live in his parish at Cwmbran, South Wales . Rejection: The Home Office rejected Lesya's application to live with her husband Elwyn Phillips on the grounds that her language skills were not adequate . Counting the cost: Vicar Elwyn Phillips, pictured with wife Lesya, is now planning to move 1,300 miles to Kiev to be with her because the couple cannot afford to reapply for her visa . Rev . Phillips, of the Cwmbran Christian Centre, near Newport, South Wales, . married Lesya in Kiev in March and applied for a spouse visa for the new . Mrs Phillips. To secure a visa to live with a UK citizen in Britain, applicants must satisfy strict criteria. Both must be aged 18 or over at the date of application. Your partner is not related to you in a way that means you could not marry in UK law. You and your partner have met in person. Your relationship with your partner is genuine and subsisting. If you are married or in a civil partnership, your marriage or civil partnership is valid in UK law, that any previous relationship has permanently broken down (this does not apply to certain polygamous relationships). You and your partner intend to live together permanently in the UK. You meet the financial requirement. You meet the English language requirement and if you are in the UK and want to extend your leave or apply for settlement in the UK you will need to meet the suitability requirement. Source: UK Border Agency . But the Home Office rejected the application even though Lesya holds a teaching qualification from the National University of Kiev. Immigrant chiefs say they do not consider her degree a 'recognised language qualification,' and that she’s not welcome in the UK. Rev Phillips, whose first wife died of cancer last year, has daughters and an elderly father still living in his home town of Cwmbran. But he says he has no choice but to leave his family and move to Ukraine to be with his wife. The dad-of-two said: 'I’ve secured a Ukrainian visa and put my house up for sale. 'My children are devastated but they understand I can’t be without her. 'Would the Home Office want this for their own family? It just seems completely unfair and inhumane.' Rev Phillips says he has already spent £1,500 on the last visa application and is unable to afford another. A Home Office spokesman said: 'Every visa application is considered in line with the UK’s immigration rules. 'It is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure they provide the required evidence to support their application. 'Mrs Phillips has the right to make a new application for a visa but must provide the correct information to support it.'","Reverend Elwyn Phillips, 55, had planned to live with second wife Lesya, 36, in his parish at Cwmbran, South Wales .

Contrast: The model's elegant ensemble and giant gold necklace jars with her essential surgical mask . Pollution: Smog in Nanjing is now so bad that flights into and across the city have been affected . Air pollution is becoming an increasingly serious issue in the world's most populous country, with scores of coal-burning power stations pushing emissions to a level that is 40 times higher than the safe limit recommended by the World Health Organisation. In Nanjing, and capital Beijing, conditions worsen in winter thanks to additional demand for power and have been exacerbated by the country's rapid urbanisation. And it's not just fashion shows that are affected by the poisonous clouds: so thick is the lingering smog, flights into and across China are regularly disrupted. The current outbreak of smog is affecting the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui and Henan provinces, although the capital has also been badly hit. Emissions: The problem has been caused by increased demand for power during winter and urbanisation . Audience: Like the models, the watching fashionistas were also forced to don surgical masks thanks to smog . Other cities to face smog-related problems during the outbreak, which has lasted for more than a week, include Shanghai and Hangzhou. But it is Nanjing that is enduring the worst of the smog, with officials putting the city on red alert according to Chinese news agency, Xinhua. Speaking to the agency, one woman said: 'It stinks like smoke. The air really scratches in your throat. We've never experienced such terrible smog.' Stunning: Despite the grim cloud of smog that overshadowed the show, the jewels on display proved popular . Hazardous: Air traffic has been badly affected after smog caused visibility to drop to less than 50 metres .

A dog described by police as 'the most dangerous we have ever seen' after it tried to bite a nine-year-old girl's head off has been ordered to be destroyed by a judge. The Japanese Akita, called Diesel, grabbed Amy Hryhoruk and clamped its jaws around her skull in a 'vice-like' grip. Her father Simon managed to wrestle the dog off his injured daughter after sprinting out of his home when he witnessed the attack. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT. Scroll down for video . This Japanese Akita, called Diesel, is to be destroyed after it attacked a nine-year-old girl . The dog has been ordered to be destroyed after it injured Amy Hryhoruk and her father Simon in an attack last year . Mr Hryhoruk managed to wrestle the dog off Amy after it attacked her. Nirmal Singh (right), 60, whose son Amrit Pal owned the dog but admitted being responsible for the animal at the time of the attack, has been fined £750 . The animal had escaped from his owner's home before 'stalking' Amy as she waved goodbye to her grandmother. Amy required 20 stitches following the incident, which happened yards from her home in Rushall, West Midlands, on May 5 last year. Her father had two operations after suffering bites to his hands and legs. The dog was seized by police following the attack and last Friday a judge at Wolverhampton Crown Court ordered it to be destroyed. Nirmal Singh, 60, whose son Amrit Pal owned the dog but admitted being responsible for the animal at the time of the attack, was fined £750. He pleaded guilty to 'allowing a dog to enter a non-public place subsequently causing an injury' contrary to the 1996 Dog Control Act. Akita’s are not on the Dangerous Dogs Act. Amy required 20 stitches following the attack, which happened yards from her home in Rushall, West Midlands . Simon Hryhoruk had two operations after suffering bites to his hands and legs . Singh, of Rushall, West Midlands, was ordered to pay kennel costs of £7,653.81, £1,200 court costs and a £15 victim surcharge. Ordering . the dog to be put down, Judge Michael Walsh said: 'I have absolutely no . hesitation in coming to the conclusion that Diesel is a dangerous dog . and that he poses a significant danger to the public in the event of him . not being subject to a destruction order.' The court heard the dog was so vicious kennel staff have been unable to examine it since it arrived 18 months ago. Amy’s father Simon, 37, a web designer, yesterday recalled the horrific moment he watched as the dog savaged his daughter. He said: 'I literally had just got back in the house when I saw the dog slowly approach Amy, before sprinting and jumping on her. Mr Hryhoruk, pictured in hospital, described the ordeal as 'absolutely horrendous' 'It knocked her over flat and started mauling her. 'Luckily she had turned away. It was just like how you see a tiger hunting its prey on a David Attenborough programme. 'The ordeal was absolutely horrendous, I thought he was going to kill Amy so just jumped on him to pull him off. 'For the last 18 months we have feared . that there was the possibility that the dog would be allowed back which . scared us all, so this is a relief.' The desperate father pulled the dog across a busy road and attempted to wrangle it into the owner’s garden. Amy had been waving goodbye to her grandmother when the dog attacked her . Zaher Afzar, prosecuting, told the court: . 'She was attacked from behind, her head was in his jaws and held there . as if it was in a vice.' Amy’s . grandfather Peter Hryhoruk is now calling for the law to change to mean . owners would face punishment for their dog’s actions even if they were . not present at the time. Mr . Hryhoryuk, a retired Army Colonel, said: 'While we welcome this . conviction and the punishment given we do feel sympathy for Mr Singh. 'Hundreds or thousands of dogs I have dealt with, and Diesel is one of, if not the, most dangerous I have come across' - PC Keith Evans . 'Because of the bizarre way the law works . with dangerous dogs he has had to carry the can so to speak because his . son, who owns the dog, was not in.' Mr Hryhoruk went on to say: 'Amy is very lucky, it could have been much much worse. She has her own retriever, so has not become afraid of dogs. 'Simon though was really scarred. It took a long time to get over the injuries and he found it hard for a long time to cope. 'He would wake up in the middle of the night terrified that someone was going to take Amy.' PC Keith Evans, of the West Midlands Police dangerous dog unit, said: 'The chances of him [Diesel] engaging in such a horrendous attack again are just massive. 'Hundreds or thousands of dogs I have dealt with, and Diesel is one of, if not the, most dangerous I have come across.' The dog had escaped from his owner's home (pictured) before it started 'stalking' Amy . He went on to say: 'This was a horrendous attack on a young girl and subsequently her father. 'The dog displayed a predator-link instinct and when it escaped from the house it stalked Amy. The safest thing was for it to be euthanised.'

"PUBLISHED: . 05:11 EST, 5 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:16 EST, 5 December 2013 . The arms of a robot widely used in keyhole surgery could stall and seize up while performing delicate operations, manufacturers have admitted. Intuitive Surgical, which make the $1.5million robotic surgery system said friction in the arms of some devices might make them stall. The company has put out an ‘urgent medical device recall’ for the robotic arms of its da Vinci Surgical System, which is used to treat cancer and has been credited with reducing the side-effects of surgery. Intuitive Surgical, which manufactures the da Vinci robotic surgery system said friction in the arms of some devices might make them stall. The company has put out an 'urgent medical device recall' for the arms of its device, which is used to treat cancer . The da Vinci has four spider‑like . arms, controlled by the surgeon, which hold cutting instruments to make . tiny incisions and remove cancerous tissue using . images from a telescope to guide the surgeon. It features a tiny telescope, which is placed inside an incision in the patient’s body. The . telescope takes images from two points, which are relayed back to a . console so the surgeon has a 3D image on-screen while he operates. Previous . evidence has shown that using these robots mean significantly less . blood loss, reduced risk of blood transfusion and probably a shorter . overall recovery time. For . surgeons, who control the robot while sitting at a computer screen . rather than standing over the patient, these operations can be less . tiring - and robotic hands don't shake. There have been reported problems with the system, including several disturbing incidents including a robotic hand that wouldn't let go of tissue grasped during surgery and a robotic arm hitting a patient in the face as she lay on the operating table. These accidents - and even several deaths linked to the system - have led to investigation. Now the company has voluntarily admitted that there could be a problem with some of the robotic arms used in its system. The problem could affect 1,386 robotic arms in use across the world, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has been investigating the safety of the robot. A statement on its website said stalling . in the robotic arms of the system could result in a sudden ‘catch up’ if . a surgeon perseveres with a move, despite slight resistance from the . machine. It said: ‘Reports of friction within certain instrument arms can interrupt smooth instrument motion. ‘This . can be felt by the surgeon as resistance in the movement of the master. In this situation, the instrument can stall momentarily and then . suddenly catch-up to the master position if the surgeon pushes through . the resistance.’ The da Vinci has four spider-like arms, controlled by the surgeon, which each hold cutting instruments to make tiny incisions. The hands can then be used to remove unwanted growths and organs, depending on the operation being carried out. It also features a tiny telescope which is placed inside an incision in the patient's body . The system's manufacturer has faced questioning over the safety of the da Vinci system's arms as well as its training procedures, Bloomberg News reported. Last month the FDA warned the number of system malfunctions, injuries and even deaths connected with the robotic device have doubled in 2013 compared with 2012. Intuitive put out its own statement about the recall last month. It said: ‘Intuitive Surgical has issued a field notice informing affected da Vinci S, Si, and Si-e System customers that it is voluntarily initiating a correction for the Patient Side Manipulators on the Patient Side Cart and repairing or replacing them as needed.’ Previous evidence has shown using these robots, rather than surgeon's hands, results in less blood loss, reduced risk of blood transfusion and a shorter overall recovery time . Talking about its safety record, the California-based company said: ‘Out of more than 55,000 procedures completed with this group of instrument arms, there has been one reported instance of interrupted motion resulting in an imprecise cut, along with two additional instances of perceived resistance. ‘No patient complications were reported in association with these three instances.’ The company said it is performing ‘comprehensive’ inspections to test its equipment in the field and repair or replace affected robotic arms. It said that around 70 per cent of the inspections are complete and most of the robotic arms did not require any adjustments.

A 2002 study in the journal European Urology found prostate cancer surgery done by da Vinci robots had better outcomes for continence and cancer control than keyhole approaches done by the human hand. The robot is also now used for heart bypass surgery, heart valve repair and hysterectomy.","Intuitive Surgical, California, makes the $1.5million robotic surgery system .

A rare encryption device invented by the Nazis towards the end of the war, which defeated Bletchley Park's code breakers, is set to be sold at auction. The SG-41Z machine is only one of ten remaining in the world and was produced as a successor to the well-known Enigma machine, which was famously thwarted by British intelligence officers at the top secret location known as 'Station X'. The initial order in 1944 was for 10,000 . machines, but only around 100 were actually produced, initially because . of material problems, and then the end of the war. Sussex auction House Burstow and Hewett are selling an exceptionally rare SG-41Z encryption machine (pictured) which was designed as the successor to the famous Nazi WW2 Enigma machine . Today there only two in working order, excluding the machine that will go under the hammer at . Burstow and Hewett auctioneers in Battle, East Sussex, next Wednesday. The rare device is expected to fetch between £15,000 and £20,000. The SG-41Z model was made with a numeric keypad rather than a letter keypad, and was produced for the Luftwaffe to encrypt weather reports. It was recovered from the sea-bed and restored to a museum standard by an East Sussex-based expert in computer and machinery restoration, although it is not in working order. Head auctioneer Mark Ellin said: 'This lot is extremely rare. Today there are thought to be only around 10 in existence - and only 2 in working order. This model, the SG-41Z, was made with a numeric keypad rather than a letter keypad, and these were produced for the Luftwaffe to encrypt weather reports . 'Station X': Bletchley Park, pictured, was the hub of the British intelligence effort, where the Engima code was repeatedly broken . 'It was brought up from a sunken U-boat a few years ago. 'Some machines were dumped into the sea after the war to stop the enemy getting their hands on them. 'There is ticker tape underneath that the encryption code comes through. It is an amazing thing, there are masses of cogs. I have never seen one before.' Mr Ellin said he has already had some interest in the machine, as World War Two memorabilia can be very collectable. 'I have been doing this a long time and see a lot of the same old things coming through so it is great to see something that I have never seen before and something that most people have never seen before,' he added. Tireless: Intelligence analysts, including these members of the Women's Royal Naval Service, worked tirelessly to break German codes in the Second World War . Alan Turing is considered the father of modern computing and helped win World War II for the Allies . The intelligence war waging in a quiet corner of Buckinghamshire was to be decisive in the Allied effort to win the Second World War. Station X - known now as Bletchley Park - was the hub of Britain's code-backing effort, where hugely talented mathematicians and inventors worked tirelessly to give the armed forces a crucial helping-hand. As Winston Churchill himself made clear, the accurate information which flowed from Bletchley Park every day, at a rate which sometimes reached 6,000 messages a day, saved lives and gave Britain a crucial edge in battle. Alan Turing, the Cambridge-educated mathematical genius, and Post Office Engineer Tommy Flowers, are the two most celebrated figures whose innovations greatly improved the Allied ability to decipher German messages. The Enigma machine, which was on sale commercially in the 1920s, was modified by the Germans to make it more secure. They trusted completely that its codes were unbreakable, and used it for all manner of important communications. However, it was thwarted in part thanks to Alan Turing's 'Bombe' device, which was able to speed up the code-breaking process immeasurably. Turing based his invention on a Polish device, the 'Bomba', which was handed over to Britain just weeks before Poland was invaded in 1939. It was not able to decipher German codes automatically, but once analysts had manually deciphered a few letters by picking out common words, such as the names of German generals or short words such as 'to' and 'they', the device could rapidly test hundreds of other possibilities to put together a code. Over 100 of the machines were built to aid the code-breaking effort, but they were all destroyed when the war ended. A replica was built in 2008, and can be seen at Bletchley Park, which is now a museum. The quest to beat the German intelligence services also resulted in the construction of the world's first proper computer - called Colossus. Developed by Tommy Flowers from a network of thousands of electronic valves, the device was able to crack the Lorenz Cipher, which the Nazi high command used for messages deemed too sensitive for Enigma transmission. The Colossus Mark II, which was five times faster than the original, was finished less than a week before the Normandy landings, and gave the Allies another crucial edge in the last phase of the war.","The SG-41Z device, which was created in 1944, is being sold at Burstow and Hewett auctioneers in Battle, East Sussex, next Wednesday .

As a recent survey reveals that women are more concerned with the state of their skin than any other body hang-up, it is no surprise the skincare business has rolled out a multitude of products that promise to turn back the effects of time. But one area that often gets neglected is the delicate area above the eye because no product has ever been designed to target that specific area - until now. Elizabeth Arden has unveiled PREVAGE Anti-aging + Intensive Repair Eye Serum - an eye treatment that claims to help reduce the severe signs of skin aging in just one use, especially the look of deep lines and crepiness that affect the delicate upper eyelid area. Banish the lines: Elizabeth Arden has unveiled PREVAGE Anti-aging + Intensive Repair Eye Serum which claims to get rid of wrinkles - including those on the eyelid . Developed in partnership with Bascom-Palmer Eye Institute, the leading centre for eye research and aesthetics, the new cream even claims to work in just fifteen minutes. The new formulation combines Elizabeth Arden’s exclusive idebenone technology, the single most powerful antioxidant, with a blend of arazine and thiotaine. Botox in a bottle? The new formulation contains Elizabeth Arden's exclusive Idebenone technology but at £95, it doesn't come cheap . Arazine claims to soothe skin and help reduce signs of ageing caused by inflammation, while thiotaine promises to protect skin from free radical damage due to environmental assaults. It also utilises moisture trap technology - a . complex of hyaluronic acid, barley and sea plant extracts that work to . help lock in moisture and plump and smooth skin. It contains optical diffusers and silicones, which claim to provide a soft focus effect to . scatter light and diminish the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles for . immediate bright and luminous skin. But does it work? Apparently so; 75 per cent of women noted a clinical improvement in deep and fine lines in 15 minutes after use. The results also revealed that seven out of 10 women preferred the new Prevage serum to their regular eye serum. But youth doesn't come cheap: the 15ml serum, which is available in Boots and should be applied twice daily, will set you back £95. Speaking about the product, Dr Yannis Alexandrides, founder of 111 Harley St said: 'While the results published certainly do sound impressive, it’s important to review the ingredients that are giving these ""instant"" results. 'Just a glance at the formula shows that it is rich in hyaluronic acid which superficially plumps the skin surface but the effect is not long lasting. Delicate: This is the first cream that has been designed to be used on the eyelid itself and help reduce the sagging effect . 'The 15-minute promise is largely down to the optical diffusers which are cosmetic agents, these are also found in foundation and concealers and reflect light off the skin, making wrinkles appear less prominent.' Beauty blogger Charlie Lankston of Small Fish Big Pond added: ‘This intensive eye serum applies beautifully - the lightweight formula means it blends effortlessly into your skin and doesn’t feel heavy or greasy around the eyes. 'It is good at tackling fine lines above the eyes, but doesn’t do a huge amount to combat dark circles so isn’t the best option for anyone hoping to fight those at the same time. ‘And while it’s a beautiful product - and of the highest quality - the price is really quite high and makes it out of the reach of a lot of women who won’t be able to afford nearly £100 for an eye serum. 'For those that can afford it and want something high-end to help tackle their lines, this is the perfect product, however for anyone hoping for a bit more of an all-rounder, there are plenty of other options available at much more reasonable prices which may be more suited to their needs.'
