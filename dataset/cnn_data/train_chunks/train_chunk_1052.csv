"Most fugitives don't have time to update their social media accounts. But Annabell Dundon, 24, who is wanted on a European Arrest Warrant after allegedly threatening to kill her brother's ex-girlfriend, has recently posted a series of provocative pictures on Facebook while on the run. Known as Bella, she comes from the notorious Dundon crime family, known for drug dealing, armed robbery and extortion, and is the younger sister of Wayne, John and Dessie Dundon - who are all in jail. Fugitive Annabell Dundon, pictured, has posted a series of provocative pictures despite being wanted by police . The Dundon brothers attempted to organise the purchase of assault rifles and rocket launchers to escalate the gang feuds in their home town of Limerick. The thugs followed in the footsteps of their father Kenneth who was first convicted for assault in 1974. He went on to serve a six-year sentence in London for stabbing Christopher Jacobs, 50, to death. But Ms Dundon's other brother Ger, 26, who was released from prison last year, is now thought to be living in London - and she is believed to be there too. Ms Dundon, who allegedly threatened to kill her brother's ex-girlfriend, posted this picture in September . Another picture shows Ma Dundon, from Limerick in Ireland, posing in a tight black dress in a bathroom . She is wanted on suspicion of threatening to kill April Collins, Ger's former girlfriend. In one photo posted a week ago, she poses with a hand in her hair wearing a jewelled white bra and miniskirt with high heels - showing off her legs and a tattoo on her stomach. In another, she is pictured pouting in a short black and white dress posing with a leg lifted up on a chair. And in another, she poses looking into a bathroom mirror wearing a tight black dress with sparkly studs. Ms Dundon was charged with threatening Miss Collins at Limerick District Court and granted bail with strict conditions. The conditions stated she must stay at her home address in Limerick and visit the Roxboro Garda station every day. But in May last year, she failed to appear for her trial at Limerick Circuit Criminal Court. Ms Dundon's Facebook cover photo is a pair of gun-shaped high heeled shows decorated with bullets .

"Halloween has long been the biggest day of the year over on Today, with the morning show team always devoting much time and energy to their costumes, and this year was no different as the anchors got to show off their comedic chops as classic characters from the long running NBC variety show Saturday Night Live. Even better, the costume department was able to just run upstairs at 30 Rock and grab the same costumes and wigs worn by many of the performers from the actual skits, which provided for some striking likenesses between the actors and anchors. Scroll down for video . The gang's all here: The anchors of Today show off their Halloween looks (left to right) Willie Geist and Tamron Hall (Spartan cheerleaders); Natalie Morales and Peter Alexander (Mary Katherine Gallagher and priest); Al Roker (Blues Brothers); Julia Sweeney and Matt Lauer (Pat); Jenna Bush Hager, Savannah Guthrie and Meredith Viera (Mom jeans); Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford (Wayne and Garth); Lester Holt (Blues Brothers) The perfect cheer: Willie Geist and Tamron Hall (above) showed off their dance moves as The Spartans, the spirited duo first played by Will Ferrell and Cheri Oteri . Mirror Image: Geist and Hall looked nearly identical to Oteri and Ferrell (above) Kicking things off live from New York was actual SNL player Kenan Thompson, doing a cold open appropriate for morning viewers as he delivered the weather as Al Roker. From there, the Saturday Night Live credits got reworked, introducing the Today team in a manner just like the SNL cast, as they hailed cabs, hopped on the subway, and, in the case of Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford, guzzled wine. Then came the skits. The newest kids on the block, Willie Geist and Tamron Hall, gave America Today's take on the very spirited Spartan cheerleaders, complete with a cheer and some carefully choreographed moves to the 90s dance classic that is C + C Music Factory's ""Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)."" Live from New York: The show even did their own version of the SNL title credits to kick things off . Superstar: Natalie Morales (above) got her Catholic school girl on as the very theatrical Mary Katherine Gallagher, a character made famous by Molly Shannon, with a little help from Peter Alexander as a priest . Diva's debut: Morales and Alexander did good work getting down the look and feel of Shannon's debut performance as Gallagher in 1995 with guest host Gabriel Byrne (above) Cheri Oteri and Will Ferrell they were not, but the two certainly had their moves down. And boy were they spirited. Speaking of spirited, Natalie Morales proved to have endless energy as she bounded out after Willie and Tamron as the very theatrical and dramatic Mary Katherine Gallagher. Joined by a dapper looking Peter Alexander, forced into the thankless role of playing the largely silent priest, Morales jumped, stretched and patted her pits just like Molly Shannon first did when she debuted the crazy Catholic school girl almost 20 years ago. Wine's world: The Pinot loving ladies from the show's fourth house, Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb (above), proved to be pretty excellent drag kings, dressing up as Garth and Wayne, the basement dwelling rockers first played by Mike Myers and Dana Carvey . Double take: The ladies bore a striking resemblance to the original duo of Myers and carvey (above) It's Pat: Matt Lauer (above) dressed up as the lovably androgynous Pat, and even got a visit from the lady who created the character, Julia Sweeney (above) The morning show's resident sommeliers, Gifford and Kotb, stepped up to the plate next, and proved to be pretty impressive actors as they delivered a remarkably good performance as basement dwelling Queen aficionados Garth and Wayne from Wayne's World. And in her torn jeans and black wig, Gifford almost looked identical to the original Wayne, Mike Myers. Al Roker and Lester Holt followed the ladies, and while they didn't get to do much acting they did get to belt out a tune as they dressed up, and sang, like The Blues Brothers, the R&B duo created by Dan Akyrod and the late John Belushi. Even better, Akyrod sent in a video giving the duo his blessing. Mom's here: Jenna Bush Hager, Savannah Guthrie and Meredith Viera (above) showed off their derrieres as the ladies from the Mom jeans commercial, originally played by funny ladies Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Rachel Dratch and Maya Rudolph . The original: Rudolph, Dratch, Fey and Poehler in the original commercial (above), which aired in 2003 during the show's Mother's Day episode . Then, for what seemed to be the finale, Matt Lauer came out as Pat, the androgynous beauty first played by Julia Sweeney, who was also on hand to do a little skit with Lauer. This marks a long running tradition of Lauer doing drag on Halloween, having previously dressed up as Pam Anderson, Jennifer Lopez and Paris Hilton. The show had one big surprise however, and ended on a very, very high note, when new moms Savannah Guthrie and Jenna Bush Hager pulled up at the end of the segment in a van and got out to reveal the final costumes of the day - the ladies from the Mom Jeans commercial. Memories: Lauer, as Pat, dreamed of one of Lauer's former drag costumes, Lauer as Pam Anderson . Fiercesome foursome: Morales, Alexander, Geist and Hall kept things going for another hour on Today's Take . Surprise appearance: Dennis Haskins even showed up to reprise his Saved by the Bell role as Mr. Belding (above) The commercial, which first premiered on SNL back in 2003 during the show's Mother's Day episode, was written by Tina Fey, and starred Fey, Amy Poehler, Rachel Dratch and Maya Rudolph showing off a new style of jeans that features pleats and a 9-inch zipper. An applique vest comes complimentary with each purchase. Hager and Guthrie, who were wearing the wigs from the original sketch, were joined by another mom too to round out their group - Meredith Vierra. The three even filmed their own version of the commercial. Everyone gets involved: Even the production team got in the Halloween spirit, dressing up as Conheads . Dancing in the street: Savannah really got into the spirit of her character, making her exit by exiting out of a minivan . Masterpiece theater: Lauer and Sweeney reenacted one of Pat's classic sketches . Following that reveal, there were more bits from the team, with Dennis Haskins showing up at one point in character as Mr. Belding from Saved by the Bell to host a mock talent show that featured Geist and Hall doing another bit and Morales falling into some boxes and  delivering one of Coach Taylor's famous Friday Night Lights monologues as Gallagher. Haskins last appearance on the show came in 2013 on the same day his former Bell costar Tiffani Thiessen was also a guest, an appearance that became memorable after the two had a very awkward exchange on the air when Haskins asked to say hello to a visibly disinterested Thiessen. Darling derrieres: Hager, Guthrie and Viera took some time to show off the junk in their trunk . And there's more: Hager, Githrie and Vierra also filmed a commercial just like the original Mom Jeans ad . Social media response to this year's costumes was almost universally positive, with Twitter and Facebook users showing a particular affinity for the ladies looks as well as Mr. Geist's cheerleader. And while not exactly panned, people had little to say about Roker and Holt's take on The Blue Brothers. Not weighing in yet, though sure to do so soon, are current and past members of Saturday Night Live. Also staying quiet on social media were past Today anchors. Guess that's why they call it the blues: Lester Holt and Al Roker (above) sang and danced as The Blues Brothers . No shade: Holt and Roker had the classic Blues Brothers suit down (above) While also paying tribute to their friends, the Today move to do SNL costumes may have also been an attempt to give some press to the struggling show on a day when the morning show, which is having its own problems with viewership, is guaranteed to have one of their biggest audiences of the year. Now in its 40th season, SNL has been having some trouble bringing in viewers, with the show's recent episode featuring former cast member Bill Hader marking an all time ratings low for the program. The show will no doubt get some help this weekend however thanks to big name host Chris Rock and even bigger named musical guest Prince.

"If you haven't yet heard of Tallia Storm, you soon will. She's only 15-years-old but she's already performed to thousands, signed a record deal and found a mentor in Sir Elton John. The talented teenager from Balfron, Stirlingshire, jokes she's a 'real life Hannah Montana' as she juggles her school work with her fledgling singing career. Like the character played by Miley Cyrus, Tallia is a diligent school girl by day and then performs and rubs shoulders with the stars by night. Rising star: Tallia Storm, 15, has signed a recording contract with Virgin Records . Her path to stardom began when she was just 13 and had a chance encounter with Elton John's partner David Furnish while on holiday with her family. The producer was staying at the same hotel and Tallia plucked up the courage to hand him her demo CD in the hope he and the famous singer would listen to it. She recalled: 'There he was having breakfast, I . wrote a note and put my CD in an envelope and just walked up to his . table. School girl by day, performer by night: Tallia, right, said her life is just like that of Disney character Hannah Montana, played by Miley Cyrus, left, as she juggles school work with her music career . Next big thing: Virgin Records say Tallia is a 'one-in-a-zillion talent' 'I took my . wee brothers for moral support - they were five and seven-years-old so I was . hoping he wouldn't be able to resist a quick chat. I just introduced myself and asked if he would pass it on. 'He was absolutely charming and so nice. He asked where I was from and what kind of music I liked. That was it. I sat back down at my table and we literally checked out of the hotel and left, with me thinking - oh well I tried.' Days later she was stunned when she received a call from the Rocket Man himself. Tallia was about to fly back to UK from . San Francisco when she picked up the phone to Elton, who was so . impressed with her recordings he invited her to open his show. Chance encounter: The singer first approached Elton John's partner David Furnish with her CD, taking her little brothers, left, along for moral support. He passed the CD on to the musician who was so impressed, he asked Tallia to perform with him . She said: 'When I got the call from Elton it was like something out of a comedy. There we . were going through security at San Francisco airport and my mobile rang - . he just said, ""Hello is that Tallia? It's Elton here"". 'My mum . was stressing and shouting at us all, my dad was his doing his own thing . and my sister was three places ahead of us in the queue. 'I . realised my battery was about to die and the big security guard suddenly . shouted and said you're not allowed to be on your phone going through . security. 'So there I was trying to explain the situation to Elton and the phone just died. It was chaotic. 'After we got through security my big sister swapped sim card to her phone and I finally got to speak to Sir Elton.' She spent . six months rehearsing and then took to the stage at the beginning of one of . his concerts for a lengthy five-song 25 minute slot. Rubbing shoulders with the stars: Tallia with model David Gandy, left, and singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran . Music moguls were as impressed with her soulful voice as Sir Elton and she's now been signed up by Virgin Records - who count Katy Perry and J Lo among their clients. The company's chief creative officer and executive vice president Ron Fair said: 'Tallia Storm is a one-in-a-zillion talent and an extraordinary 15-year-old well beyond her years. Her soulful vocals come from a deep place combined with her great melodic gift, beauty and intellect. 'Virgin Records is thrilled she is joining our roster.' Living the high life: But when Tallia isn't performing or recording she says she's just an average school girl . Tallia said she was 'over the moon' to gain the recording contract and now spends half her time at school preparing for her exams and the rest jetting across the world to top class recording studios and red carpet events. She has shared a recording studio with Daft Punk, been a guest singer at London Fashion Week and performed at the Teen Choice Awards after party. She said: 'Now my life is very Hannah Montana. During the week I'm just a regular kid, I just finished my National 5'S (GCSE's) at my local school Balfron High in Stirlingshire and I worked like a dog for them. 'Then after school, I do gigs and sing, sing, sing. At weekends I travel a lot to events, photoshoots and gigs but when I'm home, it's just back to normality.'","Tallia Storm, 15, from Stirlingshire, has signed a recording contract .

"Shopkeeper John Seabright, who fought off two armed raiders who barged into the shop where he works by spraying cleaning fluid at them . A shopkeeper fought off two hammer-wielding robbers who demanded he open the till by arming himself with surface cleaner and spraying it into their eyes. John Seabright, 62, was behind the counter of the Londis shop in Bourton-on-the-Water in Gloucestershire when two masked thugs barged in and screamed at him to hand over cash. At first he tried to grab the hammer of one of the balaclava-clad raiders but he failed. So instead he reached for the £1 bottle of Mr Muscle surface cleaner used to clean the till, and sprayed it straight into the eyes of the men through the holes of their balaclavas. That sent the robbers fleeing empty-handed with their eyes streaming. Mr Seabright said: 'They just burst in through the doors while I was serving. My very first thought was someone was playing a prank. 'They were wearing tracksuits and ski masks and they started screaming to open up the till and waving the hammer about. 'I thought that there was no way they are coming for the tills. I just said no and told them to get out. 'He couldn't reach me with the hammer unless he threw it at me. Another customer tried to tackle him so I tried to grab the hammer but I didn't get it. 'I saw there was some cleaning spray so I picked it up and I sprayed him in the eyes between the balaclava. 'It must have hurt because that was it - he scarpered, him and his mate. I think it made them just give up and scared them off.' Shop supervisor Mr Seabright was working with colleague Jim Wilsdon, 21, when the armed pair stormed the shop. CCTV footage from the shop shows the two robbers, dressed in grey and white hooded tops, barge into the store and make their way towards the counter . After demanding he open the till for them, Mr Seabright, circled, can be seen reaching for the cleaning fluid bottle and spraying it in one of the raiders' eyes . Mr Wilsdon then ushered customers - including a frightened woman and her baby - into the shop's bakery to hide while Mr Seabright tackled the thugs. The 62-year-old, who has worked at the shop for 15 years, said: 'I have to admit that my hands were shaking when I called 999, but I can't say I was really scared. 'I was fine after I had called them and actually I was serving customers before the police arrived, and back at work there at 7am the next day.' General manager of the store Ewen Smith said that he was proud of his staff's reaction. He added: 'They tried to use scare tactics to make John open the tills but John was very instinctive and, after asking him to leave, he blasted the man in the eyes with cleaning product.' The raider wearing the light coloured top managed to flee after Mr Seabright started spraying the cleaning fluid and waited at the door for his accomplice . Mr Seabright's wife Sheila, 70, admitted she was initially angry he had tackled the robbers - but said she was very proud of his bravery. She said: 'Let's just say he got a frosty reception when he came in - I was just so worried. I'm proud of him though, really proud. 'He's had half of the village going into the shop and congratulating him and shaking his hand saying he is wonderful.' The first raider has been described as 5ft 6in to 5ft 11in tall, stocky and wearing a light grey hooded tracksuit top, light grey jogging bottoms and grey face covering, possibly a ski mask. The second was taller and thinner and had a light-coloured jogging top and bottoms that appear to be darker than the top. Police say no arrests have so far been made. Mr Seabright was working with colleague Jim Wilsdon, 21, at the Londis shop in Bourton-on-the-Water, pictured, when the armed pair stormed the shop . Soon after police arrived the store, they then found themselves called to a second similar raid at Ladbrokes in Bishop's Cleeve, 19 miles away. Two masked robbers threatened a staff member with a hammer before demanding money and made off with 'a few hundred pounds'. Detectives suspect the two incidents are connected. But despite praising the actions of Mr Seabright, Gloucestershire Constabulary warn against tackling robbers. A spokesman said: 'The victim’s actions in fighting off the robbers were courageous but we do not recommend people do this generally. 'You simply do not know how an offender may react, or if they would use the weapon they are carrying, so you could be putting yourself at serious risk of harm.'","John Seabright, 62, was working behind the counter at the Londis store .

"Ed Balls was forced to unveil a series of changes to Labour’s mansion tax plan yesterday – including a charge of £3,000 a year on homes worth up to £3million. The Shadow Chancellor’s announcement of the controversial levy on homes worth £2million or more was the centrepiece of the Labour conference – with the money earmarked for the NHS. But it has been attacked by senior Labour figures, who say it will penalise pensioners who live in houses that happen to have soared in value, and the Tories said yesterday that the plans were ‘unravelling’. Scroll down for video . Labour;'s shadow chancellor Ed Balls today promised people earning less than £42,000-a-year will be able to defer paying the mansion tax . Yesterday Mr Balls said he had decided that people with an income of less than £42,000 would be able to defer payment until they sell up or die. He also revealed that Labour’s mansion tax will cost about £250 a month for someone in a home worth between £2million and £3million. This adds up to a maximum £3,000 a year – £500 above the average council tax bill for properties in top rated Band H. Home owners would pay mansion tax on top of council tax. Mr Balls also said foreign owners with second homes in the UK could be forced to pay ‘a larger contribution’ than people living in their only home. Thousands of London homes could be hit by the plan to impose the levy on properties worth more than £2million . Writing in the London Evening Standard, Mr Balls addressed concerns that ‘cash poor, asset rich’ households would suffer. ‘Ordinary Londoners should be protected and wealthy foreign investors must finally make a proper tax contribution in this country,’ he said. The tax would be ‘fair, sensible and proportionate’, he claimed, adding: ‘We will ensure those owning properties worth £2-3million will only pay an extra £250 a month. Owners and investors in properties worth tens of millions of pounds should make a much bigger contribution.’ Responding to the charge that poorer pensioners in expensive properties would be hit, he vowed that ‘long-standing residents’ on less than the higher rate of income tax — that is, less than £42,000 a year — would have a right to defer the charge ‘until the property changes hands’. Senior Labour MPs Glenda Jackson (left) and Dame Tessa Jowell have spoken out about the mansion tax and its impact on London . Mr Balls also addressed concerns that rapidly rising property prices in London would see ever-more households sucked into the tax. He said the threshold would rise in line with the average prices of homes costing £2million and more, rather than in line with average house prices. ‘We will guarantee that more modest properties are not brought into the tax,’ he said. It is estimated that 108,000 homes – the vast majority in London and the South East – will be caught by the tax. James Browne of the Institute for Fiscal Studies offered the Shadow Chancellor some support, saying it was ‘perfectly possible’ that the proposals would raise the £1.2billion that Mr Balls wanted for the NHS. But he said it would mean people with a home worth £3million and above having to pay ‘substantially’ more. Priti Patel, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, said Labour’s plans were in chaos. ‘Labour’s NHS promise has unravelled,’ he said. ‘This panicked change in policy shows Ed Miliband and Ed Balls’s homes tax won’t raise the money they say it will. 'You can’t protect the NHS if you can’t make the sums add up and bankrupt the economy like Labour did last time. ‘The only way to secure the future of our NHS is to stick to our long-term economic plan.’","Shadow chancellor moves to reassure critics in the Labour party .

"The 11th Duke of Marlborough died this morning at the age of 88, Blenheim Palace has said. The Duke, whose full name was John George Vanderbilt Henry Spencer-Churchill, was a cousin of wartime prime minister Winston Churchill and lived at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire. His title will now pass to his son, former drug addict and ex-convict, the Marquess of Blandford, 58. A spokesman for the palace said: 'With great sadness, we announce that the 11th Duke of Marlborough passed away peacefully this morning. Scroll down for video . The 11th Duke of Marlborough, pictured at Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire, with fourth wife Lily Mahtani, has died . Two generations: The Marquess of Blandford, pictured left, will now become the 12th Duke of Marlborough . Blandford being led from his rented Fulham flat in south west London in 1993 at the peak of his troubles . 'Further announcements will be made in due course. As per his wishes, the palace will be open as normal today.' The Duke married four times; first WHSmith heiress Susan Hornby, mother of his first three children, two of whom survive, second Athina Onassis, with whom he had no children, third Rosita Douglas-Sjernorp, mother of his three younger children, two of whom survive, and fourth, Persian-born Lily Mahtani. His four children are the Marquess of Blandford, Lady Henrietta Spencer-Churchill, 56, Lord Edward Spencer-Churchill, 40, and Lady Alexandra Spencer-Churchill, 38. The marquess, his eldest surviving child, battled addictions to heroin and cocaine and three spells in prison, which resulted in his father taking legal action to prevent him from inheriting the 11,500-acre estate, where Churchill was born. The Marquess of Blandford, 58, with his second wife Edla Griffiths (left). Right, the former Duke pictured in 1982 . In 1983 he was fined £100 for assaulting a policeman, and the following year he was sentenced to three months' imprisonment for breach of probation. He was put on probation again in 1985 and fined £1,000 for breaking into a chemist's shop and in 1986 he was convicted of drug offences.  At that time he admitted spending £20,000 on cocaine in four months. From the late 1980s through the early 1990s he chalked up a record of motoring offences and was repeatedly banned from driving. In May 1994, he was remanded in custody for three weeks in HMP Brixton after failing to keep appointments with probation officers, and the following month he was put on probation for 18 months and ordered to attend a clinic for drug addiction. Successor: The Marquess of Blandford has battled drug problems and brushes with the law but is now clean . The 11th duke, seen dressed as the first duke in 2004 and with Princess Anne at Blenheim Horse Trials in 2003 . The 11th Duke, who died early this morning, married four times and had six children, four of whom survive him . In December 1999 he was rushed to hospital with a missing eyelid, a badly damaged nose, three missing teeth and a broken shoulder after a car ran into his Toyota Land Cruiser in Kiddington, Oxfordshire. But he reformed his behaviour, stayed off the drugs, and after a lengthy legal battle, father and son put their differences behind them and agreed that Blandford would inherit the title while the estate would be run by a board of trustees including his younger brother, Lord Edward. The Duke said: 'I think there have been black sheep in every family and there's nothing new about that. We have had some good 'uns and some bad 'uns.' But after the rapprochement, he said: 'I am fully confident James will keep this place going. 'But over the top of him – and over the top of me – are trustees. You can’t predict the future.' The Duke, pictured at Blenheim beside a statue of Queen, married his fourth wife, Lily Mahtani, in 2008 . The 11th duke, pictured left at a countryside event last month, and right with his fourth wife, Lily Mahtani . Blenheim Palace was a reward from Queen Anne to the first Duke of Marlborough for victory over the French . Today the Prime Minister paid tribute to the Duke, saying: 'I am greatly saddened to hear of the death of the Duke of Marlborough. To me, he was not only the Vice-President of my Association but also a good man and friend. 'His Grace will be deeply missed by all those he worked alongside at Blenheim and by the town of Woodstock where he played such a positive and active role in the community he loved. 'My thoughts and prayers are with all his family and friends at this sad time.' The 11th Duke married WHSmith heiress Susan Hornby, mother of the Marquess of Blandord, in 1951 . Blenheim Palace was a gift from Queen Anne to John Churchill, the first Duke of Marlborough, in 1704. It was a reward for his victory over the army of Louis XIV of France in the Spanish War of Succession. Winston Churchill was born at Blenheim, which became a world heritage site under the stewardship of the 12th Duke.  The 200,000sq ft estate has 187 rooms, dwarfing Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle,and attracts about 500,000 visitors every year. Its grandeur registered even with Hitler. According to wartime lore, he planned to move in after invading England and ordered the Luftwaffe not to bomb it. The 11th Duke of Marlborough was born on 13 April 1926, the elder son of the tenth Duke of Marlborough by his first wife, Mary Cadogan. Winston Churchill, the then Chancellor, was his father's cousin and agreed to become his godfather. He was distantly related to the late Diana, Princess of Wales, through the Spencer family, and to the Vanderbilt dynasty via his grandfather, the ninth duke, who was said to have married Consuelo Vanderbilt purely for her cash. John Spencer-Churchill was born in 1926 and his father's cousin, Winston Churchill, right, was godfather . In 1951 he married for the first time, wedding WHSmith heiress Susan Hornby, and they went on to have three children, the eldest of whom, John Spencer-Churchill, died at the age of two.  Charles James Spencer-Churchill was born in 1955, followed by Henrietta Mary Spencer-Churchill three years later. The couple divorced ten years later, leaving the Duke free to marry Athina Onassis, ex-wife of Greek shipping tycoon, Aristotle Onassis. Like his first, this second marriage lasted ten years, after which she left him for her sister's former husband, Stavros Niarchos. In 1972, he married Rosita Douglas-Stjernorp, daughter of a Swedish count, and had three more children. The Marquess of Blandford's first wife, Becky Few-Brown, left, and second, Edla Griffiths, right . Lord Richard Spencer-Churchill was born in 1973 but died four months later.  Lord Edward Albert Charles Spencer-Churchill was born in 1974, and in 1977 Lady Alexandra Elizabeth Spencer-Churchill was born. He inherited the dukedom in 1972 when his father, the tenth Duke, died, and now his oldest surviving son, Jamie Blandford, will become the 12th Duke. Blandford has a son, George Spencer-Churchill, 22, by first wife Becky Few Brown, and daughter Araminta, seven, and son Caspar, five, by his second wife, Edla Griffiths, a Welsh ceramicist whom he met on London's Kings Road.","John George Vanderbilt Henry Spencer-Churchill was the 11th Duke .

"Consultant Rod Irvine who has been suspended amid an ongoing investigation into his treatment of thousands of women . An NHS gynaecologist being investigated over botched surgery has been linked to the deaths of at least three women, nearly 100 cases of serious injury and an allegation of sexual assault, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Consultant Rod Irvine has been suspended amid an ongoing investigation into his treatment of thousands of women across several hospitals over a two-year period. Nearly 100 women are planning legal action against Mr Irvine in what could become one of the biggest surgical scandals in recent years and may leave the NHS with a multi-million pound legal bill. Police confirmed Mr Irvine also faces a criminal investigation over an allegation he sexually assaulted a patient during an examination. Lawyers acting on behalf of women treated by Mr Irvine say the claims include operations on the wrong part of the body, inappropriate treatment, punctured organs and delayed cancer diagnoses. An investigation by this newspaper has found: . Mr Irvine, 61, who was based at Queen Mary’s Hospital, Sidcup, South-East London, was suspended by hospital bosses in November 2012 when concerns were raised following a routine audit of his operations. In July 2013, the NHS wrote to 2,000 women informing them they were carrying out a review of patients treated by the surgeon between August 2010 and August 2012. At the same time, they informed the Metropolitan Police after a woman in her 50s claimed she had been sexually assaulted by Mr Irvine during an appointment in November 2011. He was interviewed in May 2014 under caution but not arrested, and police confirmed an investigation was ongoing. The surgeon is being investigated by the General Medical Council and has been banned from carrying out private work. He is allowed to work for the NHS under strict supervision but has not done so. Jack Sargent’s mother, Susie, died in January 2010 aged 48 following complications from an operation to remove a fibroid. Mr Sargent, 21, from Welling, Kent, said his mother bled heavily after surgery and should have been given a hysterectomy because it was discovered during the operation that she was suffering from a more serious condition. Susie Sergeant, pictured in the late 1990s with her son Jack. She died in January 2010 aged 48 following complications from an operation to remove a fibroid . She died after developing a blood clot which travelled to her lung. Mr Sargent met with investigators at the Trust and said: ‘They told me my mum’s case was one of the ones brought forward as someone whose death needed to be investigated.’ Legal firms are now representing women treated by the surgeon. Irwin Mitchell confirmed it had been instructed by 20 women, Bolt Burdon Kemp is dealing with 28 claimants, Powell & Co has five cases and Hodge Jones & Allen has a further two. Dozens of other potential claims are being assessed. Esther Wilkinson, a medical negligence solicitor at Irwin Mitchell, said: ‘Our clients have suffered life-changing injuries and we are investigating allegations against Mr Irvine including alleged delays in the diagnosis of cancer, a failure to follow clinical protocols, and serious surgical errors.’ The NHS Litigation Authority has reached an agreement with the law firms to enable claims to be settled out of court, but no settlements have yet been reached. Mr Irvine’s employer, South London Healthcare NHS Trust, was dissolved in October 2013 after experiencing financial difficulties. His employment automatically transferred to King’s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, but a spokesman for the Trust said Mr Irvine had not worked at any of its hospitals. He said: ‘Mr Irvine has been employed by King’s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust since our acquisition of the Princess Royal University Hospital [PRUH] in October 2013. He has not worked at any of our hospitals during that time. ‘We are aware that a group of patients have raised concerns about the level of care provided to them prior to us taking over the PRUH.’ Last night Mr Irvine denied any wrongdoing and said his supporters claimed he was the victim of a ‘witchhunt’. He said his complication rate was ‘within national standards’. He added a Trust investigation into Mrs Sargent’s death ‘did not uphold any allegations’ made against him.","NHS consultant Rod Irvine is being investigated over botched surgery .

"Scientist Smile, who has been jailed for ten and a half years after threatening a couple in their own home with a machete . A thug who threatened two pensioners with a machete during a terrifying robbery in their own home has been jailed for ten years. Scientist Smile broke into the couple's property in Merry Hill in the West Midlands, with two accomplices earlier this year on July 6. After gaining access to the house via a bathroom window, the three men disturbed a 60-year-old woman who had got out of bed to go to the toilet around 12.15am. Wolverhampton Crown Court heard that the raiders then dragged the petrified homeowner around the house in her dressing gown back to her bedroom. They then woke the woman's sleeping husband, also aged 60, by punching him in the face and demanding gold and the location of the safe. The couple were also threatened with a machete before the thugs fled with just £100, bank cards and a mobile phone. West Midlands Police launched an investigation and arrested Smile, aged 20, at his home in Handsworth, Birmingham, on July 14 after tracking a stolen mobile phone, which linked him to the crime. He admitted one count of robbery at a previous hearing and was jailed for ten-and-a-half years at Wolverhampton Crown Court. After the case Detective Constable Nick Taylor, from Wolverhampton CID, who investigated the raid, said: 'This was a violent and terrifying attack on a couple in their own home. 'Both the occupants of the house were assaulted as their attackers clearly believed there were items of significant value inside the house but ultimately fled with very little. Smile, 20, of Handsworth in Birmingham had admitted one count of robbery before he was sentenced at Wolverhampton Crown Court, pictured . 'This is a significant sentence for a man who showed no mercy in his determination to get what he wanted. 'Hopefully the sentence offers some comfort to his victims whilst sending a message that this kind of crime will not be tolerated, and comes with lengthy sentences.'

"Guilty: Calliope 'Ope' Saaga from Sartoga Springs, Utah, admitted to taking money families had 'scrimped and saved' for a 2012 band trip that never happened . A travel agent who was paid $360,000 to organize a high school marching band's trip to Hawaii faces 20 years in prison - because he pocketed the fee and spent it on a 47-day trip to Las Vegas. Calliope 'Ope' Saaga from Sartoga Springs, Utah, pleaded guilty on Wednesday to taking the money families from Willard High School in Missouri had 'scrimped and saved' for. The 40-year-old, who worked for Present America Tours LLC, was supposed to book plane tickets, lodging, transportation, meals, tours and insurance for more than 300 students and chaperones on the 2012 trip. Instead he used the funds - wired to him $30,000-a-time by the band's boosters - for gambling, flights and his personal lifestyles. Under an agreement, he pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud. He faces a sentence of up to 20 years in prison, a $250,000 fine and an order or restitution, according to the Springfield News-Leader. Julie Germann, a Willard school board member who was at the hearing, told the paper: 'I was hoping he would turn around just once and look at us and acknowledge who he stole from. There were kids and families that scrimped and saved for this opportunity.' Chris Church, who was thew band's director for 32 years added: 'The kids and the parents and the families in Willard want justice, want restitution and want to see that this man never does this again. 'Until everything is finalized, you're still holding your breath. That was a lot of money for these families.' Saaga, had previously set up a number of Willard band trips and had built a good working relationship with the school. Germann said he was 'a delightful person to work with' and wondered what happened in his life to make things go so wrong. Throughout the process, he temporarily 'lulled' the band's boosters into suggesting his trip was being planned on schedule. Following the hearing, he was released on bond until the next hearing which is expected in two or three months.

"Jesse Matthew, the prime suspect in the kidnapping of University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, was driving a cab the night Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington vanished in 2009, it was revealed today. Matthew, 32, was arrested last month and charged with abduction with intent to defile in the Graham case after leading police on a manhunt that ended in Texas. Graham, 18, a sophomore at UVA, was last seen on a surveillance video walking with Matthew on the Charlottesville downtown mall on the morning of September 13. She hasn’t been seen or heard from since. Scroll down for video . Taxi driver: Jesse Matthew (pictured), 32, was driving a cab the night Morgan Harrington, 20, went missing in Charlottesville in October 2009 . The 32-year-old nursing assistant also has been linked by DNA evidence to the disappearance of 20-year-old Morgan Harrington five years earlier. The young woman went missing October 17, 2009, after attending a Metallica concert at John Paul Jones Arena in Charlottesville. The Virginia Tech student's corpse was discovered on a farm in Albemarie three months later. Speaking to federal and state officials, Matthew’s former co-workers recalled that on the night of Harrignton’s disappearance, the suspect was working as a cab driver. Charlottesville taxi driver Melvin Carter Jr also told NBC29 that he had been told by a police detective that Ms Harrington got into a cab after the fateful rock concert. Prime suspect: Matthew (left) has been charged with abduction with intent to defile in the disappearance of UVA sophomore Hannah Graham (right) Another victim: Morgan Harrington, 20, was found dead on a farm three months after she was seen leaving a Metallica concert . ‘[They] said yes, she did jump into a taxi cab her last time being seen alive,’ said Carter, Jr. ‘He could have made an impression on her because what I heard from her mental state, she was upset, so she may have found someone who was loving and trusting and comforted her,’ Carter speculated. Following the 20-year-old’s disappearance, Matthew was interviewed by police along with dozens of cab drivers who were behind that wheel the night of October 17, 2009. Captured: Matthew was extradited from Galveston County, Texas, last month following a manhunt .

Premonition: Matthew's fellow cabbies recalled how at times he would get upset when they would jokingly compare him to a sketch of Harrington's killer and a suspect in a 2005 rape . Two weeks ago, police working on the Harrington and Graham cases recovered Matthew's old cab from a Virginia farm. Meanwhile, federal and state investigators have interviewed about 20 taxi drivers in Charlottesville asking about Morgan Harrington and Matthew's demeanor. Dan Harrington, Morgan's father, released a statement Thursday saying their family have been hoping that more pieces of the puzzle would come together. ‘It's exciting, it's encouraging to hear but it's still sad for us too,’ the statement read. ‘It will hopefully open up more doors for us.’ Filled with hope: Dan Harrington, Morgan's father (left), released a statement Thursday saying their family have been hoping that more pieces of the puzzle would come together .

People who knew Matthew in 2009 told CBS6 how they would joke with him that he resembled a sketch connected to a 2005 rape case in Fairfax and the Harrington case. Matthew at times would ignore their jabs, but every once in a while he would appear shaken and take off on his own for hours. The FBI indicated that based on forensic evidence, Harrington’s killer also raped a woman in Northern Virginia in 2005 .","Matthew's former co-workers in the taxi industry told police he was driving a cab the night Harrington went missing .

"More eyewitnesses have come forward in the shooting of Michael Brown and backed up previous claims that the teenager did nothing wrong in the moments before a police officer killed him. Tiffany Mitchell, who watched the shooting unfold, told CNN on Wednesday that the police's version of events - that Brown assaulted the officer and tried to grab his gun - was not true. Brown did not enter the police vehicle, as authorities have claimed, but there appeared to be a struggle at the window, Ms Mitchell said. Scroll down for video . Tiffany Mitchell (pictured right on Wednesday) and Piaget Crenshaw (left) were eye-witnesses to the Michael Brown shooting on Saturday. They backed up a previous witness's claim that Brown had done nothing wrong before he was shot up to eight times by a Ferguson police officer . Ms Mitchell recorded video of the aftermath of the shooting which included the horrifying moment that a man, believed to be Michael Brown's uncle, rushed up to the teenager's lifeless body . A police officer rushed  to push the man back from the body of 18-year-old unarmed Michael Brown following the police shooting on Saturday . 'It looked as if Michael was pushing off and the cop was trying to pull him in,' she told CNN. Michael Brown pictured in January 2013. He was shot dead on Saturday by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri . 'The cop shot a fire through the window. Michael breaks away and starts running away but the officer continued shooting.' Ms Mitchell had gone to the Ferguson, Missouri neighborhood on Saturday to pick up an employee, Piaget Crenshaw, for work. Ms Crenshaw, who lives in an apartment with a balcony overlooking the street, also witnessed the incident. Before the shooting, it appeared that the 18-year-old and police officer were 'arm-wrestling', she told CNN. Both women said that a shot was fired and that Brown started running away from the officer and the patrol vehicle. They said that the officer chased the teen roughly 20 feet down the street and fired shots at him  in the St Louis suburb. The 18-year-old turned and raised his hands in the air, the witnesses said, but the shots kept coming. In the chaotic aftermath of the attack, news of the shooting spread quickly. On cellphone footage shot by Ms Mitchell, a man believed to be Michael Brown's uncle approached the body to see if it is his nephew.A police officer rushed up to the man and pushed him back. Ms Mitchell and Ms Crenshaw have given statements to St Louis County police who are handling the investigation. The reports from the two women appeared to confirm an earlier eye-witness account from Brown's friend, Dorian Johnson, who was walking with the teenager when police approached them. Mr Johnson, 22, said that he and Brown were walking home from a store when the cop told them to get out of the street and 'get the f***' on to the sidewalk'. Dorian Johnson (pictured left on Tuesday) with his attorney Freeman Bosley (right) said that police shot his friend Michael Brown who was unarmed and raised his arms . Johnson said they kept walking after explaining to the officer they were almost home. The officer then pulled his truck in front of them and blocked the road, Johnson said. The officer threw open the door which slammed closed again after bouncing off Brown, the friend said. It was then that the officer grabbed his friend by the neck. Mr Johnson told MSNBC on Tuesday: 'The time frame was 60 seconds or less, it got out of hand really quickly.' He said that the officer had drawn his gun by this time and threatened to shoot Michael. 'I seen the fire come out of the barrel,' he told the network. 'I could see so vividly what was going on because I was so close.' Johnson said the first time the officer fired, he and Brown got scared and ran away but he could already see that the teenager had blood coming down his shirt where he had been shot. The 22-year-old ducked behind a car but Brown kept running. 'He shot again, and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air, and he started to get down,' Johnson said. The 22-year-old said: '[Brown] stopped, turned with his hands up and said ''I don’t have a gun, stop shooting!'' 'But the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and fired several more shots.' The body of Michael Brown lies in a Ferguson street on Saturday. The unarmed teenager's death, at the hands of a police officer, has sparked riots in the quiet suburban neighborhood . The eye-witness said despite the teenager's protests, the officer shot again, hitting Brown and leaving him on the ground. Mr Johnson told the TV station that he ran in terror to his apartment and vomited, before checking he had not been shot. He came out from his apartment to see his friend lying dead in the middle of the street. 'We wasn’t causing harm to nobody,' Johnson added. 'We had no weapons on us at all.' The 22-year-old spoke to MSNBC on Tuesday alongside his attorney and former St Louis' mayor, Freeman Bosley Jr. The lawyer said on Tuesday that he had offered police the opportunity to interview his client about Saturday's tragic events but they initially declined. Mr Johnson was finally interviewed by the police on Wednesday. Police have offered a different version of events of the altercation which led to the fatal shooting on Saturday. Authorities said that while the officer was exiting his car, he was physically assaulted by Brown and there was a struggle over the cop's weapon. Police do not dispute that the officer shot the subject multiple times and that the deceased was not armed. Ferguson police said on Tuesday that they would not be releasing the name of the officer involved in the shooting because of death threats on social media. Brown's shooting has sparked riots in the streets of suburban Ferguson, Missouri, where 70 per cent of the population is African-American but in a 53-strong police force there are only three black officers. Riot police deployed tear gas and bean-bag rounds on Monday night to disperse an agitated crowd. Mr Johnson said that he was still in shock over his friend's death and how quickly the situation escalated. He described the 18-year-old, who was due to start technical college on Monday, as 'a quiet, kind and gentle' person.","Eyewitnesses Tiffany Mitchell and Piaget Crenshaw said on Wednesday that the police officer tried to pull Michael Brown into his patrol vehicle before a shot was fired .

"He had his hand and part of his arm torn off but that didn't stop shark attack survivor Sean Pollard giving his footy mates an inspiring speech from his hospital bed ahead of their grand final match. The Bunbury man was due to play for his South Bunbury Football Club on Sunday but he was mauled by a shark at Wylie Bay at Kelpids Beach, about 6km east of Esperance on Western Australia's south coast on Thursday morning. While his team mates huddled around a mobile phone in the change rooms to hear Mr Pollard speak before taking on Carey Park at Hands Oval in South Bunbury, the club also read inspiring letters from witnesses who helped rescue the surfer after the attack.

Scroll down for video . He had his hand and part of his arm torn off but that didn't stop shark attack survivor Sean Pollard giving his footy mates an inspiring speech from his hospital bed . Mr Pollard swam back to shore after being attacked and was pulled from the water by Peter Rothnie and Dean Gaebler before the pair, along with nearby beach goers helped assist him. ‘I have never seen a more courageous human being and probably never will,"" Mr Rothnie wrote in the letter to the team, according to The West Australian. ‘His desire to live another day, his desire to see (girlfriend) Claire, his family and friends and, dare I say it, his footy mates was above and beyond comprehension. ‘The amount of determination Sean had to get himself to safety and then the determination he showed to keep calm was simply nothing short of miraculous.’ Sean Pollard was mauled by a shark at Wylie Bay at Kelpids Beach, about 6km east of Esperance on Western Australia's south coast on Thursday morning .

Mr Pollard's uncle, Kim Fergusson, issued a statement on behalf of the family on Monday, thanking the rescuers and crediting them with saving his life. He said Mr Pollard's partner and the family had remained by his side since the ordeal. ‘Sean has said his first goal is to stand and receive a group hug from his family, such is the character of this remarkable young man,’ Mr Fergusson said. He said Mr Pollard's traumatic injuries were being closely monitored by doctors at the hospital with the recovery plan from each procedure requiring the intervention of many medical professionals. ‘What is aiding Sean's recovery is his physical fitness, as a result of his healthy lifestyle and active sporting interests,’ Mr Fergusson said. ‘However, his injuries are severe so there will be a long road ahead.’ The family has set-up the Sean Pollard Appeal on Facebook, seeking donations to help with his rehabilitation . Mr Fergusson said the family had been overwhelmed with offers of support from the public, which he described as very comforting. The family has set-up the Sean Pollard Appeal on Facebook, seeking donations to help with his rehabilitation. Natalie Banks, founder of the No WA Shark Cull campaign, has also launched an Indiegogo fundraiser for Mr Pollard, so far raising more than $6000. Collection tins remain at the Esperance Shire's administration and leisure centres and hundreds of dollars were raised through the grand final to help fund his long road to recovery. The state's Fisheries Department responded to the attack by catching and killing two young female white sharks on drumlines - the first time the protected species had been killed by WA officials. An examination of Mr Pollard's surfboard indicated a white shark was responsible. But scientists could not determine if either of the caught sharks had attacked the victim because they often disgorged stomach contents. Mr Pollard had reportedly claimed to have been attacked by two bronze whalers but Fisheries said white sharks sometimes had a bronze discolouration.","Sean Pollard was mauled by a shark at Wylie Bay at Kelpids Beach on Western Australia's south coast on Thursday .

"The wheels may have come off Texas Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Wendy Davis' campaign with a video ad that uses an empty wheelchair to target Republican Greg Abbott, the Lone Star state's partially paralyzed attorney general. The two pols are locked in a bitter struggle to succeed Gov. Rick Perry; the ad, which Davis unveiled Friday has attracted widespread criticism from everywhere except her campaign office. Abbott, 56, has been a paraplegic since age 26 when he was paralyzed by a falling tree during a run. The Davis ad uses an empty wheelchair to symbolize her critique of his handling of victims' legal claims. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Texas Republican Attorney General Greg Abbott's wheelchair is the centerpiece of an attack ad from his opponent for the governor's mansion, Democratic legislator Wendy Davis . Davis, a rising star in the Democratic Party, shot to fame with a 13-hour filibuster last year to protest legislation that restricted abortions . Republican Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott has been a wheelchair-bound paraplegic since a tree fell on him during a run three decades ago . 'A tree fell on Greg Abbott. He sued and got millions,' the ad's narrator says. 'Since then, he's spent his career working against other victims.' 'Abbott argued a woman whose leg was amputated was not disabled because she had an artificial limb,' the ad alleges. 'He ruled against a rape victim who sued a corporation for failing to do a background check on a sexual predator. He sided with a hospital that failed to stop a dangerous surgeon who paralyzed patients.' Abbott's campaign fired at Davis, a state senator, with both barrels after the ad went viral for all the wrong reasons. 'It is challenging to find language strong enough to condemn Sen. Davis' disgusting television ad, which represents a historic low for someone seeking to represent Texans,' the campaign's deputy communications director, Amelia Chasse, said in a statement. 'Sen. Davis' ad shows a disturbing lack of judgment from a desperate politician,' she said, 'and completely disqualifies her from seeking higher office in Texas.' Her campaign stood its ground, claiming the ad shows that 'after rightly seeking justice for himself, Greg Abbott turned around and spent his entire career denying that same kind of justice to other victims.' The three most recent published polls show Abbott leading the race by an average of 11.3 percentage points, according to Real Clear Politics. Davis stepped away from a backbench in the Texas legislature in 2013 when she spent 13 hours filibustering a law written to limit the number of clinics in the state that could perform abortions. After she successfully ran out the clock on the legislative session, Gov. Perry called lawmakers back for a special session to pass the bill anyway. The pink sneakers she wore during the marathon as supporters flooded the capitol rotunda became a rallying cry for the state's liberal minority, and she was quickly urged to run for governor. A right-wing pundit labeled her 'Abortion Barbie' weeks later. That epithet has stuck. It appeared on 20 posters that showed up in Hollywood, California in May when Davis traveled there to raise money. A Republican donor paid for the posters, designed by street artist Sabo – the same anonymous man who created posters mocking Barack Obama and actress Gwyneth Paltrow this week when the president spoke a a fundraiser she hosted at her expansive Los Angeles home. Lightning rod: Davis' May 2014 fundraising trip to California brought political jabs out of the woodwork, including this mocking poster . A star is born: Abortion rights activists packed the state capitol to congratulate Davis after her 13-hour filibuster . Online reactions ranged from the angry to the sarcastic, including this tweet . Journalists, usually impartial observers, got in on the act by mocking the Davis campaign's ad strategy . The wheelchair ad has attracted slings and arrows from both right and left. Republican National Committee spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski called it 'ridiculous.' Fox News Channel co-host Bob Beckel, a liberal voice who managed the 1984 presidential campaign of Walter Mondale, offered some of the harshest words. 'This isn't a Hail Mary,' he said during a broadcast of 'The Five.' 'This is a Hail Mary to lose. This is like running the other way with the ball.' 'This is the kind of thing that you never, ever do, is take advantage of some of your opponents physical or mental ... conditions,' Beckel said. 'It's almost certain to backfire in every direction you could possibly imagine.'","State Sen.

"Victim Jonny Shaw, who tracked down the thief who stole his power tools using eBay and then confronted him . A handyman who had his power tools stolen found the items for sale on eBay - and then tracked down the thief himself after police told him they weren't going to investigate. Jonny Shaw feared he would have to fork out £4,000 to replace his collection of electric saws, screwdrivers, drills and other tools after they were taken from his Ford Transit van in Colne, Lancashire. In the hope they might turn up online, Mr Shaw began trawling through the online auction site two days after the theft as police told him they weren't going to do anything about it. The former special constable then found his tools on sale, and decided to pose as a prospective buyer. He then won the auction with his bid and told police where he would be meeting the man for the stolen goods, and suggested they be there to arrest the thief. And after agreeing that he would cough when it was time to pounce, officers then swooped on Julian Morris, 35, and arrested him on his doorstep. When they went inside his house, they found most of Mr Shaw's tools. Today Morris, of Oswaldwistle in Lancashire, was warned he faced jail after admitting handling stolen goods - including a multi-tool, planers, saws, jigsaws, drills and nailers - at Burnley Magistrates' Court. Mr Shaw explained: 'That morning I reported it to the police but they weren't doing anything about it and were just giving me a crime reference number - although an officer did come out to see me. 'I just gave up because they get so much of this sort of thing and I understand it's hard for them to chase up. I knew I'd be given a crime reference number so because of that I wanted to look for the tools myself. 'I was mad. I've had my tools stolen before and had to buy them again. I was going mad, this was my livelihood and a lot of people were let down because of it. 'I have 10 men under me and we were having to hire tools in for three or four days. The lads couldn't work that day, it had a big effect for three or four days. It was an absolute nightmare.' Two days later, Mr Shaw began his own investigation and logged on to eBay suspecting the tools may have been put up for auction. To his surprise he then found the tools were being sold by a user with the eBay ID JuMorris79. The 26-year-old said he recognised the tools straight away as he had marked some of them with his initials. He said: 'I thought the tools would probably be sold on the internet so I had a look. I couldn't believe he had put them on so soon. I got robbed on a Tuesday and by the Thursday they were on eBay. I kept a watch on them on the site and two days later he put some more on. 'At first I thought that they couldn't be mine but they had obvious modifications done to them and I was zooming in on the pictures and the serial numbers. 'I thought ""they are definitely mine"" and I thought ""I've got to win them"" and put a decent bid in. I was winning them and beating people. I did it on my girlfriend's account so he wouldn't know it was me. It was quite nerve wracking.' Mr Shaw successfully won the auction and contacted the seller to get his address, telling him he could come and collect them. He added: 'I told police and they said they'd have to get a warrant and that would take two days. 'I thought, ""I'm winning these back."" I rang the inspector and said that I knew they were mine straight away. He was really good and said he'd meet me round the corner of the address. 'On the day of the pick-up I had my mate with me because he wanted to come and I had all the barcodes of the tools written on my hand and my friend had to text the inspector saying ""yes come round"". We parked at the end of the drive so he couldn't shoot off. It was like something off the TV. Julian Morris, who admitted handling stolen goods and was warned that he could face jail . 'This guy came out of the house and he had my tools. He kept coming to the door with everything else that had been robbed. I identified all the tools. I said to my mate that if I start coughing that means they are my tools. 'As soon as he came out I started coughing. The police came flying around the corner in a van and a car and started running up the drive. He had his back to them so he didn't know what was going on and they pinned him. Just before, I had said ""they are my tools"". 'He didn't know what to do, he said, ""Let me say sorry to my wife"". His wife and kids were there, I felt awkward because she was crying. 'When I found the tools the Burnley police were brilliant. After the inspector was saying ""good work"". I always wanted to be in the police but when I did it I didn't like it - it was too much paperwork.' At Burnley Magistrates' Court Tracey Yates, prosecuting, said Mr Shaw contacted police, who were then on standby when he went to collect the tools. She added: 'When the defendant opened the door and brought the items, he identified them as clearly having been stolen from his van. The defendant was arrested.' Morris's address was searched and officers returned further tools to Mr Shaw. Six items which had been stolen were not recovered and that included a £25 wallet and £275 cash.The defendant's van was searched and four snap bags cannabis were found. In interview Morris said he got the tools from somebody he knew - but refused to name -and claimed he was gullible. He said he would have got the money either through PayPal or cash. He had 14 offences on his record. Morris, who was not legally represented, told the court: 'We had just had a baby and I was skint.' He described himself a a 'car booter' said someone he had met at a sale asked him if he wanted to sell some stuff on eBay for them and he would get 20 per cent. He added: 'He told me he had bought them at a car boot. To be honest, I didn't ask any questions. I'm sorry.' Morris who also admitted possessing cannabis was bailed until November, for reports. The chair of the bench told him there were 'all options open' for sentencing and added: 'That can be right through to custody.'","Jonny Shaw feared he would have to pay £4,000 to replace his stolen tools .

"Buried in the Sierra Nevada jungle in the north of a country that is assailed by preconceptions, Colombia’s Lost City remains a lot like Colombia itself - unexplored and off-limits for most travellers. The thrilling journey to reach these ruins left by the Tayrona civilization could provide a good starting point for a classic Indian Jones adventure. But while it is mainly the long decades of drug-related violence that have kept tourists away from Colombia, it was a much more romantic turn of events that resulted in this archaeological marvel being largely hidden from the world. Travellers attempting to reach Colombia's 'Lost City' must make a 15-mile trek into the Sierra Nevada jungle . Locally referred to as La Ciudad Perdida, these intriguing leftovers are believed to have been built around 800AD - and were only stumbled upon by accident by tropical bird hunters in the early 1970s, five centuries after the Tayrona Amerindians had fled the area following the Spanish invasion. During the interim, the remains of the city were lost from sight, consumed by the jungle. But now, they could be Colombia's answer to Machu Picchu - having been painstakingly cleared and opened up to tourists. Of course, visitors have to get there first - and the gruelling 15-mile trek is no mean feat. The journey is traditionally offered as a five-day trip. My local guide Pedro looks at me in slight disbelief when I tell him I want to attempt the journey in three. Take a look: The route into the jungle offers breathtaking views of Colombia's Sierra Nevada mountain range . He has, he informs me, only done this a handful of times before. ‘Are you sure?’ he enquires. The reason for his trepidation becomes clear when we set off the next morning. Within half an hour of our departure, we are briskly negotiating a steep two-mile climb. It seems to go on forever. Eventually, the dusty track which has been carved into the mountainside spits us into dense jungle. Had this been Colombia’s rainy season (between April and November), it would have been virtually impossible to tackle such a treacherous route in such a short amount of time. But the forecast on this occasion is dry, the slopes are firm underfoot, and the rivers are low. Only another seven hours to go today: The route to La Ciudad Perdida is challenging, particularly during the rainy season between April and November, when the steep slopes become wet and the rivers are high . Instead, we quickly find that our main obstacle is the stifling jungle heat. From now on, all of my belongings seem to be wet. A good supply of shirts and quick-drying garments is a must on a trip like this. Some much needed respite from the sticky humidity comes as we make our first lunch stop. We waste no time diving into the icy water behind our camp to cool off underneath the waterfall and the deserted plunge pools of the Buritaca River. Usually this would be the place for the first overnight stop. But our three-day itinerary means we now pack up and press on, meandering through the forest and past a succession of primitive villages - still inhabited by groups of local Kogi Amerindians who work in the forest, dressed in their Stetson hats and Wellington boots. Making a splash: Much needed respite from the sticky humidity is offered by plunge pools in the Buritaca River . Steady as he goes: River are crossed by wading through the water barefoot. During the wet season, the rivers can reach waist height and backpackers are often toppled by the strong currents . Four more hours of steady marching take us to our camp for the evening. We arrive just before nightfall. It has been a steady seven hours on foot. 'Beds' for the night, visible in the failing light, will be the hammocks which hang from the rafters of a small wooden cabin by the river’s edge. In the absence of electricity, dinner is prepared over a log fire and eaten by candlelight on long 'banquet' tables. These also accommodate a group of backpackers who are wearily making their return journey from the Lost City. Those hankering after an old-fashioned adventure will be right at home in this jungle. It offers an experience as authentic as it is challenging – although the odd luxury can still be found in the form of fresh grilled fish and a chilled beer at dinnertime. Humble accommodation: Walkers en route to the Ciudad Perdida sleep in hammocks slung from shelters . Welcome fuel: Dinner of grilled fish (and cold beer) being prepared on a wood-burning stove at the campsite . The next morning, we set off at 6am, after watching the sun rise over breakfast. I have managed a surprisingly good night’s sleep in my hammock, with the only interruption coming from the concerto of noise provided by the local wildlife. A combination of chirping and humming plays out until dawn - while, during the night, the shrubbery around the campsite is lit up like a Christmas tree by the glow of a thousand insects. We travel along a clear path - but the rivers that flow across it are barriers that have not, so far, been lowered by the steady increase in tourism to the Lost City. Every waterway has to be waded across in bare feet, with backpacks held above the head for balance. Strong currents frequently topple travellers attempting to traverse the rivers waist-deep in the wet season. On the up: The final challenge in reaching the Lost City comes in the form of more than 1,200 stone steps twisting up and disappearing high into the mountainside before finally emerging at the entrance to the site . There it is at last:  The 1,200-year-old ruins of the 'Lost City' were only re-discovered in the 1970s . At one crossing, a rather ramshackle, hand-operated cable car provides meagre assistance. The final challenge in reaching our destination comes in the form of more than 1,200 stone steps, which twist up and disappear high into the mountainside - before finally emerging at the entrance to the Lost City. It is the same staircase that was stumbled upon by accident in the 1970s, when La Ciudad Perdida and its stone terraces were re-discovered by local hunters. But the sheer effort required to get to this spot has ensured that, for all its beauty, the site remains free of the crowds that are bussed in to Peru’s Machu Picchu on a daily basis. A world of wonder: The trek to La Ciudad Perdida showcases the best of Colombia’s natural beauty and wildlife . When we arrive, we have the entire site virtually to ourselves, the only sounds coming from several squawking birds in the distance. We are provided with breathtaking views of the horizon, which can change almost by the hour. High visibility over the Sierra Nevada mountain range can swiftly turn to rolling mist over the tree-tops. Although Colombia has enjoyed an increase in tourism over recent years after slowing shedding its reputation for danger and violence, this reversal in fortune suffered a setback in 2003 when eight foreigners hiking to La Ciudad Perdida were kidnapped by guerrillas and held for three months. On the way back home: Simon prepares for the long four-hour drive along the coast to Cartagena . It was not until 2005 that the military was sent in, allowing treks to the Lost City to resume. The route is now closely monitored by troops. While the trek to La Ciudad Perdida offers the best of Colombia’s natural beauty and wildlife, it is the 'nearby' city of Cartagena that provides travellers with a taste of the country’s intoxicating culture. A four-hour bus ride west along the Caribbean coast from Santa Marta take visitors to this beautiful, medieval walled city. Old and new: Cartagena provides travellers to Colombia with a taste of the country’s intoxicating culture . The old town’s mix of energetic nightlife and vibrantly coloured  streets manages to attract tourists and backpackers, while the city’s thriving corporate district is abuzz with new investment. It may be the Lost City that provides a glimpse back at Colombia’s history. But Cartagena is a nod to the future of this stunning South American country. Delta (0871 2211222; www.delta.com) flies from London to Bogota via Atlanta from £860 return. Business class flights start at £2330 return. Treks to the Lost City (La Ciudad Perdida) can be booked with Magic Tours (www.magictourcolombia.com), based in Santa Marta. The trek costs around £175 per person, including food, accommodation and National Park entrance fees. English-speaking guides should be requested for non-Spanish speakers.","Ruins, known locally as La Ciudad Perdida, were re-discovered in the 1970s .

"A university fraternity has been suspended after allegedly giving a quiz to its members that asked: ‘If I could rape someone, who would it be?’ The University of Vermont is investigating the source of the survey, who saw it and how it was used by Burlington brotherhood Sigma Phi Epsilon. Almost 20 years ago the same fraternity was criticised over sexual questions, after it asked students what they would do with a stripper. Scroll down for video . Question: The University of Vermont is investigating the source of the survey, who saw it and how it was used by fraternity Sigma Phi Epsilon in Burlington . The survey begins with basic questions about the student’s name, subject studied and their favourite memories, reported CBS affiliate WCAX. It then asks 'Where in public would I want to have sex?', 'Who's my favourite artist?’ and ‘If I could rape someone, who would it be?’ ‘The fraternity has instructed the chapter to cease all operations, pending further investigation,’ a spokesman at the fraternity’s headquarters said. ‘Any behaviour that demeans women is not tolerated by the fraternity,’ the national  Sigma Phi Epsilon spokesman - in Richmond, Virginia - added. Past: Almost 20 years ago the same fraternity (house pictured) was criticised over sexual questions, after it asked students what they would do with a stripper . Campus police are now trying to establish if criminal charges could be pressed over the incident, reported the Burlington Free Press. 'Any behaviour that demeans women is not tolerated by the fraternity' Sigma Phi Epsilon national spokesman . ‘We don’t know what we’ve got right now,’ a university spokesman said. ‘We don’t know which individual or individuals are involved.’ The fraternity’s national office sent a representative to Burlington on Tuesday as they aim to find out more about the incident. In July 1993 the national office revoked the University of Vermont chapter’s charter for at least three years, reported the Burlington Free Press. Upset: Student Meredith Knowles said she was 'greatly offended' by the question as someone she knew was raped, 'so it hits close to home' This was after a video emerged of potential new members being asked to tell a story, a racist joke and describe their sexual encounters. 'I am greatly offended. Someone very close to me was actually raped, so it hits close to home' Meredith Knowles . The university found out about the latest incident over the weekend after a tip-off from a student. The fraternity has around 45 members. English Professor Nancy Welch made a link between the incident and cuts to the ‘Women's and Gender Studies' budget. Women’s right group FedUp has called for the fraternity to be shut and the university to launch a campaign against ‘sexism and rape culture’. ‘I am greatly offended,’ student Meredith Knowles told WCAX. ‘Someone very close to me was actually raped, so it hits close to home.’ See video here .","University of Vermont investigating source of survey .

"David Moyes has been counted out of one of the plum jobs waiting to be filled at the end of the season. Bayer Leverkusen would have been the perfect fit for relaunching the 50-year old Scot’s managerial career after the shock of being sacked just 10 months into his Old Trafford tenure. They are on the look out for a new boss after firing former Liverpool defender Sami Hyypia earlier this month and are on course for a Champions League place. Additionally, Moyes spoke of his wish to manage a top German side in a recent interview. But Sportsmail understands Leverkusen’s board have ruled him out on grounds of price and profile. Ruled out: David Moyes is too expensive to be considered for the Bayer Leverkusen job . They want a younger coach in the mould of Borussia Dortmund’s Jurgen Klopp and are unwilling to pay any more than £1.2million a year for the right man. The initial response from the Bay Arena is that Moyes – like former Chelsea boss Roberto Di Matteo, who also briefly came under consideration – would be too expensive after earning £5m a year at United. They are also unconvinced that Moyes, who turns 51 on Friday, fits into the category of coach they are looking for after making a policy decision to try and unearth the next Klopp and setting their sights on three targets. One of the trio, 40-year old Thomas Tuchel, has already ruled himself out after declaring he intends spending at least one more season at Mainz, where he took over in August, 2009 and reeled off seven straight wins at the start of the 2010-11 season, including a victory at Bayern Munich. But Red Bull Salzburg’s Roger Schmidt and Augsburg’s 39-year old coach Markus Weinzierl are still in the frame and look to be locked in a straight fight to succeed Hyypia. Sacked: Sami Hyypia (centre) was ousted by Bayer Leverkusen earlier this month . Down and out: Hyypia was sacked but Leverkusen are on course for a Champions League spot . Click here to see David Moyes' job options . Weinzierl’s stock has been steadily rising and reached new heights recently when his unfancied team beat Bayern to end the European champions’ remarkable 53-game unbeaten run, while Schmidt has suffered only six defeats in 47 games as Salzburg boss and has just steered them to the Austrian title by finishing an incredible 24 points ahead of Rapid Vienna. News that Leverkusen are currently looking no further than those two may well come as a disappointment to Moyes, who admitted in an interview with France Football just 16 months ago: ‘I always had the hope of being a coach abroad,’ he said. Straight fight: Roger Schmidt (left) and Markus Weinzierl are in the frame to replace Hyypia at Leverkusen . ‘If I had the choice, I would probably go to Germany, in part because they have a mentality there that is similar to mine but also because I am fascinated by what happens in German football. They seem to have found a way of producing young players.’ Unfortunately for Moyes, they also seem to have found a way of producing young coaches, and Leverkusen are closing in on two of the brightest, rather than venturing further afield, for their next managerial appointment.","Moyes spoke in recent interview of wish to manage in Bundesliga .

"A Detroit-area couple who first met at a support group for weight loss surgery patients have married after losing an amazing combined total of 380 pounds. Crysta Danaher, 34, and Bill Anderson, 44, were married on Saturday at Henry Ford Wyandotte Hospital, Michigan, where they both had bariatric surgery and later met. Anderson has gone from 459 pounds to about 250 pounds since his May 2008 operation and his new wife Danaher has lost about 180 pounds since her 2009 procedure.

Anderson, left, has gone from 459 pounds to about 250 pounds since his bariatric surgery op in 2008, while Danaher, right, has lost about 180 pounds since 2009 . The surgery and support group have ‘changed everything,' said Anderson, who has since run two full marathons and more than a dozen half-marathons. ‘There isn't any aspect of my life it hasn't changed,’ he told The Detroit Free Press. ‘From being able to run to finding love, it's changed everything.’ The couple decided to get married on November 1 as is an important date in their relationship - they had their first date on November 1, 2011 and exactly two years later Anderson proposed to Danaher in Central Park, while in the city to run the New York City Marathon. When it came to choosing a venue, the couple couldn't think of anywhere more fitting than Multi Purpose Room A at Henry Ford Wyandotte Hospital. The couple wed in Multi Purpose Room A at the Henry Ford Wyandotte Hospital, the venue of their first meeting . Here comes the bride: November 1 as is a special date for the couple.

That is where they had first met in the support group where bariatric surgery patients could talk openly with others about their struggles to lose weight. The hospital has hosted weddings before in its chapel, but never in one of its meeting rooms. Although the hospital is in the middle of renovations, construction crews managed to finish the room in time for Bill and Crysta's big day. The ceremony was officiated by the couple's yoga teacher and about 100 friends and relatives managed to squeeze in on Saturday. A reception was held afterwards at the Italian American Hall in nearby Wyandotte. While their guests sat down to enjoy a traditional wedding fare, the happy couple had to be more careful about what they ate as the surgery shrinks has shrunk the size of their stomachs. The couple plan on honeymooning in Cancun, where Danaher admits they may indulge a little. 'We're probably both going to be hurting on the honeymoon because we'll try things we shouldn't,' she said.

"Although the FA Cup first round is new territory for Warrington Town, their manager Shaun Reid does have cup experience to draw upon, and not only as the younger brother of former Everton star Peter. As a Rochdale player, he remembers standing toe to toe in the tunnel with Vinnie Jones for a League Cup tie when Wimbledon's Crazy Gang were in their pomp. 'Vinnie said to me: 'I've done your kid and I'm going to do you'. I knew then it was going to be a battle,' recalls Reid. Former Sunderland boss and current Mumbai City manager Peter Reid, alongside brother Shaun . Shaun Reid is determined to follow in his brother's footsteps and make the grade as a manager . 'He was taller than me but I used to like them big. We kicked seven bells out of each other, we might as well not have had a ball, and some of the things that were said would get you put in jail today. 'After the game we had a pint in the lounge at Spotland and he said: 'Oh my God, I thought I was the maddest footballer on the planet'.' So Reid is not the type to be intimidated by League Two Exeter City in the first live FA Cup tie to be screened by the BBC since 2008. Having spent his career in Peter's shadow, tonight is Shaun's time in the spotlight. He is the first Warrington manager in their 65-year history to take them to this stage of the cup. To do it from the Evo-Stik Northern division — the eighth tier of English football — is some achievement, which is why their fans snapped up the 2,500 tickets within hours. Their Cantilever Park ground, by the Manchester Ship Canal, has never seen anything like it. Average home gates rarely top 250 and the Warrington players earn about £80 a week. Reid Jnr takes time out for a coffee ahead of his side's FA Cup meeting with Exeter on Friday night . Reid, 49, says: 'I am a hothead, I wear my heart on my sleeve and I probably need to calm down or I'll have a cardiac arrest. Football is about passion. If you can get 18 or 20 people in the dressing room with the same desire, you can achieve. 'My problem is I cannot accept people going onto a football field and not giving everything. You're not always going to have the best match in the world but you can stop your opponent from having the best match.' Sometimes that passion has spilled over and he has received more than one touchline ban for berating referees. But Reid, who played more than 400 games in the Fourth Division, has worked hard to tone down his behaviour and promises he will not be swearing on the touchline as this game will be beamed into family homes all around the country. Eighth tier outfit Warrington take on League Two side Exeter City in the BBC Two televised FA Cup game . 'Officials are in the game to improve as well — I try to improve them!' he smiles. 'One thing I won't do is jeopardise my club and its standing in the community. Unless they have an unbelievably good bleep machine, you won't hear me using bad language. The dressing room will be my domain, in there I will be myself.' 'I do overstep the mark at times but I am improving. I take advice from people, I speak to Peter because he's been through most things in football and he knows me inside-out.' What differentiates Warrington from most non-League underdogs is that there is potential to grow. 'I was brought in by Toby Macormac (Warrington's chairman) to try and achieve Football League status,' said Reid. 'Warrington is supposed to be a rugby league town but I don't believe that because there are more kids playing football than rugby. Fact. Peter Reid celebrates promotion to the Premier League with Sunderland  at Wembley in 1999 . The 58-year-old also managed Leeds United for a brief spell in 2003 . 'There are 200,000 people in this town and the Warrington Wolves average gate is about 10,000. So there are 190,000 people out there who might just want to come and watch a football team.' 'This cup game is a start. Words can't describe how special it is for the people who have worked behind the scenes for years. 'We've come so far. I joined in 2012 when we didn't have any players. I used to take a clipboard with the names of 50 players coming in for trials. It started from there.' Players to look out for include goalkeeper Karl Wills, rated one of the best outside the League, defender Craig Robinson whose brother is MK Dons boss Karl, and former Liverpool trainee David Mannix. Lewis Field, a fitness instructor nicknamed 'Jesus' by team-mates because of his beard and flowing locks, scored the goal against North Ferriby that got Warrington here. World Cup winner Roger Hunt, who played for Warrington between 1955 and 1958 when they were known as Stockton Heath Albion, still lives locally and joined the squad for the first-round draw. The 49-year-old looks on during a training session with Warrington Town last week . For all the success he enjoyed at Liverpool under Bill Shankly, he never forgot his first club. 'I owe Warrington a lot,' says Hunt. 'It was our manager at the time, Freddie Worrall, who persuaded me to join Liverpool rather than Swindon even though they were offering less money. He said I'd be happier staying in the north west. I am glad I took his advice.' One of Warrington's directors is their local MP David Mowat, who joined other businessmen to save the club from administration in 2008. Mowat said: 'We are closely knitted into the fabric of community life.' It is hard to think Warrington's big night under the lights would have been possible without Reid, whose obsession with football once saw him walk out on a career's advisor at school who suggested farming. 'Football is my fix, the thing that gets me up in the morning,' he said. 'You can't explain to people who say it's 'just football'. Please don't say that, particularly when you see how special this has been.'","Shaun Reid is looking to follow in the footsteps of his brother Peter .

"An inseparable father and son who were staying in adjoining rooms at a hospice in their final weeks battling cancer died of the disease within a day of each other. Eileen Thurlow, 71, has been left devastated by the death of both her husband Eric and her son Dean after both succumbed to cancer. The pair spent a lot of time together as they loved fishing and travelled around the country together to pursue the sport. Dean Thurlow (left) died just a day before his father Eric (right).

Dean, who has an eight-year-old son, became ill four years ago. His father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer about 15 months ago and underwent surgery and chemotherapy but died this week. Dean was taken into Pendleside Hospice on September 25, with his father following him just weeks later on October 8.

"The brutal murder of Clare Wood at the hands of her ex-boyfriend led to new laws being introduced to protect women from men with a violent history. Leading the charge for change was Clare's heartbroken father, Michael Wood, a retired prison officer from Batley, West Yorkshire, who would never had imagined he would one day be rallying MPs and making impassioned speeches in the Palace of Westminster. This year Clare's Law (officially called the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme), was finally passed five years after her murder. Now her father has spoken of his grief and how her death forced him to fight for justice. Crime that shook Britain: Clare was murdered by her boyfriend George Appleton but her legacy has resulted in a law to help other women find out about their partner's violent pasts . Unexpected campaigner: Clare's father, pictured with her when she was younger, felt he had to fight for justice for other women following his daughter's death . He said of the campaign: 'I was handed a baton, which I really couldn't put down. The more I held onto it, the bigger it got. It sparked something off in the media, the papers; I was inundated. 'I ended up talking in the Palace of Westminster. I ended up talking to women's groups. Before Clare died, I wouldn't have said boo to a goose. But I was encouraged on by people who said ""You're doing right. What you're asking is common sense.""' Mr Wood called for a change in the law and better communication between police forces so that women can be given information about a partner's previous history of violence if they request it. The law has now been implemented but it came too late for single mother Clare, 36, who was strangled and set on fire by her ex-boyfriend George Appleton at her home in Salford, Greater Manchester, in February 2009. Clare had met her killer on Facebook and had no idea he had a history of violence against women. However, she soon discovered his aggression and had contacted the police on various occasions to complain against offences he had committed against her. When she tried to leave him, he committed the fatal attack and then later killed himself. In a new interview for a documentary, 'Crimes That Shook Britain' on the Crime and Investigations channel, Mr Wood said he had taken an 'instant dislike' to Appleton and knew he was 'basically rotten' when his daughter brought him home. He said he tried to dissuade Clare from continuing their relationship to no avail. However, despite his misgivings about Appleton, he had no idea at the time about the terrible way he was treating his daughter . All the way to Downing Street: Michael's actions led to Clare's Law being passed as the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme. He's pictured here with his partner Elizabeth, left, and MP Hazel Blears . He said: 'To find out that my daughter had been interviewed by the police on five or six occasions, that there’d been a stopper put on her letterbox because he had threatened to pour petrol and set the house on fire. If I had known, I would have been down there in a second I really would. 'I'm not the tallest of fellas, and I've met bully boys all through my life, and bullying doesn't stop at the playground gates, it continues in life. And I had recognised that in George Appleton too late.' On the night she died, Appleton went to Clare’s house and strangled her in her bed then set her body on fire. 'To know that a member of my family spent their last minutes on this earth kicking, screaming and fighting. Because some idiot couldn't take no for an answer. It leaves me dumbfounded, it really does,' Mr Wood said. He added: 'Even now it still puzzles me. The mentality of George Appleton to take my daughter's life and then take his own. For what?! What the hell did any of it achieve?! Nothing! Nothing!' But Mr Wood has been able to achieve something after campaigning for Clare's Law which was championed by MPs including Hazel Blears and Theresa May. The bereft father said he knew he had to do something to prevent another family suffered like he had. Gone but not forgotten: Michael can't bring his little girl back but he wanted to prevent other women becoming victims of domestic violence . He said: 'It dawned on me that for every person like me or every girl that was killed like Clare, I likened it to like dropping a pebble into a pond. There was two parents, brothers, sisters, uncles, aunties, grannies, family and friends all with the same sorrow, the same grief, the same mental torture of ""why didn't I see it coming?""' But he admits while Clare's Law will never pout an end to domestic violence, he hopes it will go some way to helping other sufferers. It is this thought that allows him some peace and hope after his years of grieving. He said: 'I would like to think that now at least one girl in the UK who had the sense to go to the bobbies and say, ""has he?"" escapes what happened to my kid. And that would be just the icing on the cake. I ask for no more than that. If I've saved one, I'll be delighted.' Speaking on the documentary, Theresa May said the implementation of Clare's Law shows progress is being made but there is still a long way to go to end domestic violence. She said: 'Sadly the figures that we see for violence against women and girls remain quite stubborn. I mean it's quite difficult to change those. But I think the changes that the government has made; I think the new tools and powers we've introduced are an important part of changing. 'But it is about changing culture and attitudes as well. There is still a lot more to do. The government has done a lot but there is a lot more work to do and we will continue to focus on this because I want to see an end to violence against women and girls. I want to see an end to domestic violence. It is an abhorrent crime.' Crimes That Shook Britain: Clare Wood is on CI at 9pm on 21 September .","Clare was murdered in 2009 by her boyfriend .

"Passengers on flight MH370 died of oxygen starvation hours before the pilot performed a controlled ditching in the Indian Ocean, according to a new study into the disaster. Analysis by a veteran air accident investigator suggests that all 239 people lost consciousness up to four hours before the Boeing 777 disappeared beneath the waves. The most likely scenario is that pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah deliberately depressurised the cabin, thereby depriving those on board of air, the research concludes. Scroll down for video . Theory: Geoff Taylor (left) and Ewan Wilson who have written a book which claims the pilot of MH370 cut off the oxygen supply to the passengers before deliberately crashing into the Indian Ocean . Although oxygen masks would have dropped down automatically from above the seats, their supply was limited to just 20 minutes. Those unable to grab a mask, including sleeping passengers, would have passed out within the space of a few minutes. The entire 'ghost plane' - including her cabin crew whose air supply is only marginally longer, would have slipped into a coma and died shortly after from oxygen starvation. Ahmad Shah, who locked his co-pilot out of the cockpit, survived long enough - either by repressurising the aircraft or from breathing his own, more extensive air supply - to evade radar and 'execute his master plan', researchers have concluded. He then performed a controlled ditching in the sea, which would explain why no debris has been found because the plane landed and sank in one piece. 'Mentally ill': The book claims the most likely scenario is that pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah (above) deliberately depressurised the cabin then flew for another three hours before ditching into the sea . The theory is the result of the first independent study into March's disaster by the New Zealand-based air accident investigator, Ewan Wilson. Wilson, the founder of Kiwi Airlines . and a commercial pilot himself, arrived at the shocking conclusion after . considering 'every conceivable alternative scenario'. However, he has not been able to provide any conclusive evidence to support his theory. An earlier report from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) also concluded that passengers may have died from hypoxia. And Malaysian authorities previously named Ahmad Shah as their prime suspect. The . remarkable claims are made in the book 'Goodnight Malaysian 370', the . culmination of a four-month study into the incident, which Wilson . co-wrote with the New Zealand broadsheet journalist, Geoff Taylor. Wilson, . a qualified transport safety investigator, said: 'One of our objectives . in writing this book was, in some small way, to convey the human . stories of the tragedy. 'Our . other, more important task was to pursue the truth about what really . happened; that is one small contribution we felt we could make to this . whole, terrible affair. 'We could never have foreseen the information we uncovered, or their implications. 'Neither could we have imagined the horrific scenario that our research suggests took place on board that fateful plane.' Wilson and Taylor's entire scenario makes for difficult reading. They . believe that Ahmad Shah, who they have concluded was suffering from . mental illness, tricked his co-pilot Fariq Hamid into taking a break . about 40 minutes after take-off. After . locking Hamid out of the cockpit, Ahmad Shah made his last broadcast to . air traffic control - 'Goodnight, Malaysian 370' - before switching off . the aircraft's air-to-ground communication links. Alone . at the controls, he took MH370 up to 39,000 feet and de-pressurised the . aircraft, giving passengers and crew less than 60 seconds of Time of . Useful Consciousness (TUC). Search . continues: Officials claim they are 'making progress' as they continue . to scour 60,000 sq km of sea for the plane. The orange line indicates . 'high priority' search areas; the yellow has been searched already . Ahmad . Shah could not have prevented the plane's oxygen masks from . automatically dropping down or an automated emergency announcement in . English. But Flight 370 was a . night flight and, with the cabin lights off, the majority of passengers . would have been asleep, or close to it. And for 227 of the 239 passengers, English was not their first language. Cabin crew would have tried to help those on board, but would have had to have donned their own facemasks first. 'It would have been a frightening and confusing time throughout the cabin,' Taylor said. 'By . the time some of the passengers had woken up groggy, heard the . commotion and looked around in confusion, it would have been too late . for them. 'Those passengers . who did not react within 60 seconds or less would have lapsed into . unconsciousness and death would have followed within four to six . minutes.' International . effort: Australia's deputy prime minister Warren Truss unveiled the . latest search plan at a press conference in Canberra earlier this month. The . government has contracted a new firm to take up the search . Those who had found a mask would have had between 12 and 22 minutes of breathing time before blacking out. The cabin crew's oxygen supply would have lasted for about 70 minutes, depending upon the height of the aircraft. By the time MH370 returned to cruising altitude, everyone on board would have perished. Ahmad Shah would have had three hours' worth of oxygen - plenty enough, the authors believe, to carry out the 'final act of his performance'. They conclude that he set a course for the southern Indian Ocean and, after the fuel ran dry, glided the aircraft for a further 100 nautical miles before performing a controlled ditching on the surface of the water. Wilson, a trained commercial pilot, said: 'Ahmad Shah was a man known for his methodical, thorough nature, for his love of the technical, and probably for his ego, too. 'This would have been his final sad act to his family and to the world: ""find this one"".'","Book claims pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah deliberately depressurised cabin .

"Caged: A picture of Hassan taken in April this year . An alleged pirate kingpin has been arrested in a Hollywood-style sting that lured him from Somalia to Belgium to work on a fake documentary about high-seas crime. When Mohamed Abdi Hassan arrived in Brussels on Saturday he expected to sign a lucrative contract to be an expert advisor on a documentary. But instead he and an alleged accomplice known as Tiiceey were arrested at the airport and immediately jailed. Federal prosecutor Johan Delmulle said Abdi Hassan was charged with hijacking the Belgian dredger ship Pompei and kidnapping its crew of nine in 2009 and participating in a criminal organisation. A U.N. report last year called Abdi Hassan 'one of the most notorious and influential leaders' of a major Somali pirate organisation that roamed the seas hijacking ships for ransom. '(He's) one of the most important and infamous kingpin pirate leaders, responsible for the hijacking of dozens of commercial vessels from 2008 to 2013.' Delmulle said. The Belgian ship Pompei which was allegedly hijacked by Hassan and his gang . Hassan, who is known as 'Big Mouth' is thought to be one of Somalia's most influential pirate leaders . In 2009, Somali pirates released the Pompei's crew after 10 weeks because the ship's owner paid a large ransom. Belgium caught two pirates involved in the hijacking, convicted them and sentenced them to nine and 10 years in prison. 'Too often, these people remain beyond reach while they let others do the dirty work,' Delmulle told reporters. Malaysian authorities almost captured the reclusive Adbi Hassan in April 2012 but a document from the Somali transitional government let him slip back home, the UN report said. Belgian authorities then went undercover to nab him, because they knew he traveled very little and that an international arrest warrant would produce no results in unstable Somalia. They approached Tiiceey, dangling a fake job as an adviser to a fake movie about piracy that would 'mirror his life as a pirate', Delmulle said. He took the bait. The prosecutor refused to divulge any more details on the sting. The two Somalis will appear in court today in Brugge.","Mohamed Abdi Hassan thought he was going to advise on documentary .

"Police have issued a warning to online daters after a New Zealand woman, 28, was allegedly gang-raped by a group of men on Saturday night in Sydney's south. The New Zealander was on a business trip when she met up with a man from mobile dating app Tinder. The woman told police they met at a restaurant in Kings Cross - Sydney's inner city - before the pair moved on to a bar in Martin Place and was later joined by the man's friends. But she believes her drink got spiked after she felt dizzy, numb and later found herself at an unknown property. She says this was where she was sexually assaulted by the group of men. Scroll down for video . Police warned that Tinder-users should take extra caution when meeting people from online as they are of 'sexual predators out there who use modern technology to find potential victims' This comes after a New Zealand woman met up with a man at Kings Cross, Sydney's inner city, on Saturday night after speaking to him through mobile dating app Tinder . Police say the pair then moved on to a bar in Martin Place where they were joined by the man's friends . The woman was able to leave the property, believed to be in the Botany area in Sydney's south, on Sunday morning. She told colleagues about the incident before they informed police. Police warned that Tinder-users should take extra caution when meeting people from online. 'The vast majority of people who use dating websites and apps do so for the right reasons but there are a number of sexual predators out there who use modern technology to find potential victims,' Detective Inspector Michael Haddow said. He further advised that those thinking of meeting someone from dating websites or apps should bring a friend on the date. 'It's absolutely vital that people using dating websites and apps remember that how a person portrays themselves on the internet can be very different from their real life persona,' Detective Inspector Haddow said. 'With this in mind, we strongly advise people that if they decide to meet a person they have been introduced to via the internet, then ensure the meeting is in a public place and take a friend along with you. 'Having a friend there ensures that one of you can always keep an eye on your drink, and you have someone to turn to who can help you out should you feel threatened or uncomfortable. 'If it's not possible to bring a friend with you, then, at the very least, stay in regular contact with a family member or friend, keeping them abreast of how the night is going and where you may be heading to.' The man, who met the New Zealand tourist in Kings Cross, is described as being of Pacific Islander/Maori appearance. The woman was treated at a Sydney hospital on Monday but has now returned to New Zelaand where she is being supported by family.

"Former Australian politician Pauline Hanson . Another Australian public figure has come forward to say that she is 'offended' by Muslim headscarves, just days after Prime Minister Tony Abbott publicly branded the burqa as 'confronting'. Pauline Hanson - who once made headlines when she warned that Australia was in danger of becoming 'swamped by Asians' - has spoken out in support of the burqa ban, saying that 'people wearing full face coverings, including women, are known to have hidden bombs underneath'. 'I'm offended by the burqa, and opposed to even the niqab,' she declared in an opinion piece published by The Courier Mail on Saturday. This follows Prime Minister Tony Abbott's announcement that he found the burqa 'confronting' on Wednesday while Palmer United Party Senator Jacqui Lambie continues to call for burqas to be banned. Ms Hanson showed her support for Ms Lambie, saying that she speaks for many Australians. The former leader of the One Nation Party agrees that no one should wear headscarves in parliament, banks or public place for security reasons and says she feels bad for the women who she believes are obligated to wear such garments. Ms Hanson says it is her understanding that every terrorist attack has been by Muslims and states wearing the headscarves create fear and is 'not the Australian way of life'. The former politician says Muslim women should abide by the Australian law and further urged the government to take a stance. Scroll down for video . Pauline Hanson says she is offended and opposed to Muslim headscarves such as the the niqab (pictured) Ms Hanson supports the calls to ban the burqa (pictured), saying that 'people wearing full face coverings, including women, are known to have hidden bombs underneath' Her controversial views are well in line with Ms Lambie's, after the outspoken senator clashed on live TV with a Muslim woman as she continued to call for burqas to be banned. In a spirited debate on the Seven's Sunrise program, Palmer United Party Senator Ms Lambie said the debate was a 'national security issue' because people needed to be identifiable. But Muslim Women's Association executive officer Maha Abdo, who wears a hijab, laughed off her comments, insisting someone wearing a burqa is not a threat. Ms Abdo insisted Muslim women were allowed to lift their veil to show their faces to authorities. Palmer United Party Senator Jacqui Lambie (left) in a heated debate about the burqa ban with Muslim Women's Association executive officer Maha Abdo (right) on Seven's Sunrise program . Prime Minister Tony Abbott says he finds the burqa 'confronting' and wishes 'it was not worn' The senator also praised Prime Minister Tony Abbott for his 'courage' and 'strength' in publicly branding the burqa 'confronting' on Wednesday. 'I've said before that I find it a fairly confronting form of attire, and frankly I wish it was not worn,' Mr Abbott told reporters. 'But we are a free country and a free society and it's not the business of government to tell people what they should and should not wear.' For a brief moment on Thursday, there was even a plan to keep Muslim visitors who wanted to watch proceedings at Parliament House in a glass enclosure. The plan was quashed late last night by Prime Minister Tony Abbott, following community uproar and backlash from members of his own party. Last month, Ms Lambie re-posted a meme of a woman wearing a burqa holding a gun which was captioned: 'For security reasons it is time to ban the burqa'. Ms Hanson became the centre of a racist storm following a maiden speech to the House of Representatives in 1996 where she voiced her opposition to immigration and multiculturalism, while also claiming that Australia was 'in danger of becoming swamped by Asians'.","The former leader of the One Nation Party says Muslim headscarves create fear .

"DJ Neil Fox today vowed to clear his name after being arrested over over alleged sex offences against two women. Speaking outside the £3million home in Chelsea, south-west London, which he shares with his 41-year-old wife Vicky and their three children,  Fox said he had found yesterday ‘stressful’. The 53-year-old Magic FM breakfast show host - who was bailed last night after questioning at a Metropolitan Police station in central London - insisted he would ‘work hard to clear my name’. 'I'll work hard to clear my name': Speaking outside the £3million home in Chelsea he shares with his wife Vicky, 41, and their three children, Neil Fox (pictured above) said he had found yesterday 'stressful' Radio DJ: Neil 'Dr' Fox was arrested at the studios of Magic FM in central London, just moments after he finished presenting his breakfast show yesterday morning. He was then questioned at a police station . Broadcaster: Fox has been married to wife Vicky - pictured together in 2012 (left) and last year (right) - since 1999. He was bailed last night after being questioned over alleged sexual offences . Fox, who wore a black shirt and jeans and appeared to be exhausted, told reporters this morning: ‘Obviously I had a very stressful day yesterday - it was a complete surprise. ‘I haven’t really got much very to say in terms of a statement at the moment. I need to go and speak to my lawyer and see where it all stands and just see where we are.’ The father of three was questioned for more than seven hours over four alleged offences. Three against him are historic and the fourth relates to an incident earlier this year. He added: ‘I’ve got three young children trying to get on with their school life and you have to respect their privacy in all of this. It’s nothing to do with them, obviously. On TV: Fox (far right) is perhaps best known as one of the judges on Pop Idol with (from left) Simon Cowell, Pete Waterman and Nicki Chapman. He has also presented a Channel 5 show based on the Top 40 Chart . Earlier this month Fox (right) hosted Magic FM's London's Biggest Breakfast which was attended by Mayor Boris Johnson (left), who hosted a breakfast club at the event. He joined the commercial radio station in 2005 . ‘It’s to do with me and the serious allegations made against me, and obviously what I want to do is work hard to clear my name. As and when I’ve got more to say I will.’ Today, Fox missed his morning show on Magic - which he has presented for nine years. He was arrested at the central London offices of the radio station yesterday just moments after coming off air at 10am. Officers searched his Chelsea home, as well as a countryside property he owns in West Sussex. A Scotland Yard spokesman said yesterday: ‘The man was arrested at a business address in W1 and taken to a central London police station. ‘Officers subsequently searched addresses in SW6 and the Littlehampton area of West Sussex. The man has now been bailed to return on a date in early December pending further inquiries.’ Radio star: Fox (left, in 2011), who is known by nicknames 'Dr Fox' and 'Foxy', started his career in local radio. He is also pictured (right) with Pamela Anderson at the National Television Awards in 2002, where Pop Idol won . The probe – the latest in high-profile inquiries into the conduct of ageing celebrities – does not fall under Operation Yewtree, which investigated the Jimmy Savile scandal. A spokesman for Bauer Media confirmed Fox had been arrested. He said the presenter would be off air from today ‘to enable him to devote his full attention to dealing with these matters’. The spokesman added: ‘All other aspects of his contract will remain unchanged while matters are resolved. We can make no further comment at this stage.’ Fox rose to fame as a radio DJ in the 1990s, but is perhaps best known as one of the judges on Pop Idol, a forerunner of The X Factor, alongside Simon Cowell , Pete Waterman and Nicki Chapman. The series ran on ITV from 2001 to 2003 and set the format of TV talent shows based on audience voting for the next decade.

"Dementia is now the leading killer of women, claiming almost 32,000 lives a year . Dementia is now the leading killer of women – claiming almost 32,000 lives a year. Official figures show three times as many deaths are caused by dementia and Alzheimer’s as breast cancer, while it is the third biggest killer of men. Dementia rose as a proportion of deaths in women from 11.5 per cent in 2012 to 12.2 per cent in 2013. Experts believe rising numbers may partly result from better awareness of the disease and willingness of doctors to record it on death certificates. The Government’s drive to improve rates of diagnosis and tackle the stigma surrounding dementia may also have boosted the figures. Coronary heart disease remains the leading cause of death in men – accounting for one in six deaths. Almost 38,000 men died from acute heart conditions including heart attacks last year, while 31,850 women died from dementia. Cancer is the leading killer of men and women when all subtypes of the disease are combined, accounting for three in 10 deaths, says the data from the Office for National Statistics. Overall, according to the ONS, there were 506,790 deaths registered in England and Wales in 2013, a rise of 1.5 per cent compared with 2012. Of these, 261,205 were in women and 245,585 in men. There has been a dramatic shift in the causes of death since 2003 with heart attacks plummeting as a proportion of the total, down from 22 per cent to 16 per cent in men and from 15 per cent to 10 per cent in women. Over the same period of time, dementia trebled as a cause of male deaths - up from two per cent to six per cent - and more than doubled in women, up from five per cent to 12 per cent. Dementia overtook heart disease as the leading cause of death in women for the first time in 2012. Experts believe rising numbers may partly result from better awareness of the disease and willingness of doctors to record it on death certificates . Gavin Terry, Policy Manager at Alzheimer’s Society, said: ‘With 225,000 people developing dementia every year and numbers set to soar, dementia is one of the biggest health and social care challenges the UK faces. ‘For too long dementia has been wrongly seen by many clinicians as a natural part of ageing and, as such, they have failed to record it as a cause of death. ‘Increasing awareness of the condition has started to combat this, and these figures are likely to be a product of that.’ Hilary Evans, Director of External Affairs for Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: ‘Age is the biggest risk factor for dementia, and with women living longer than men, we would expect to see this reflected in cause of death. Sadly, about half a million women in the UK are living with dementia. ‘The figures highlight dementia as a huge problem that we cannot shy away from any longer. Dementia and Alzheimer's now claim three times as many lives as breast cancer . ‘Encouragingly, the statistics reveal that other health conditions, such as heart disease, are beginning to be tamed and this has come about due to improved research into treatment, prevention and better public health. ‘We must now turn our attentions to dementia – our greatest health challenge – and invest in research that will drive better prevention and treatment of the condition.’ Professor Peter Weissberg, Medical Director at the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘heart disease continues to blight the lives of thousands of people and families. ‘We’ve made great progress over the last 50 years but we still need to fund much more research to stop people dying needlessly, and to help the increasing number of people living with heart disease.’ Professor Peter Johnson, Cancer Research UK’s chief clinician, said: ‘Cancer remains a huge challenge. 'Although we have made great progress against it, it’s still the highest cause of deaths in England and Wales. ‘This is partly because people in the UK are living longer – cancer is more common in older people because there is more time for faults in cells to develop – these faults trigger the disease. ‘The good news is that thanks to research, survival from cancer has doubled in the last 40 years.’","Dementia now claims almost 32,000 lives a year - more than heart disease .

"As a father of two young boys the one thing I dread is the infuriating battle of wills that breaks out whenever it is time to put on their coats and shoes to leave the house. So, when my wife suggested our first family skiing holiday the idea of kitting them out each morning in stubborn skiing boots, uncomfortable helmets, and easily lost gloves, goggles and lift passes made me develop a sudden enthusiasm for staying put in London and visiting lots of museums. I was overruled, of course, and so we headed for the French Alps. David Dillon and wife Elizabeth and their two sons Thomas (left) and Jack on the slopes of the French Alps . The four-star Chalet Hotel Les Deux Domaines in Belle Plagne is the ideal base from which to explore Paradiski, the linked areas of La Plagne and Les Arcs, offering 464 miles of pistes and 141 lifts . I was looking forward to saying 'I told you so' as the boys struggled at the equipment hire shop. My wife, Elizabeth, who is a much more experienced skier than me, was wondering what all the fuss was about. Thankfully I was proved wrong.The local ski hire staff were both thoughtful and slick and Thomas, nine, and his seven year-old brother Jack were measured up and fully equipped along with a dozen other British children with astonishing speed and ease. Our boys were waiting by the hire shop door eager to get on with the holiday frustrated only by their dad who was still struggling to get his boots on. David and with his wife Elizabeth (left) and his sons Jack and Thomas (right) enjoying their winter break . We were staying at Esprit Ski's flagship four-star Chalet Hotel Les Deux Domaines in the charming resort of Belle Plagne. This village sized, family-friendly destination benefits from the extensive facilities of the La Plagne resort of which it is a part, but is more relaxed and charming than some of the other more sprawling resort towns. It is an ideal base from which to explore Paradiski, the linked areas of La Plagne and Les Arcs, offering 464 miles of pistes and 141 lifts. The hotel is modern and well equipped but does not suffer from the jarring ugliness of other large hotels in some French resorts. Instead it nestles unobtrusively just a short walk from the atmospheric town centre. The Dillon boys loved ski school and were swiftly measured up and  fully equipped along with other children . David found it a delight to watch his boys shepherded off to ski school in the morning . The boys' room, with en suite shower was huge and sunny. Two balconies (both with reassuringly high safety rails) offered magnificent views across and down the pretty Tarentaise Valley and were a wonderful spot to enjoy afternoon tea. Thomas and Jack chose to sleep together in a comfortable double sized sofa bed but there were facilities to sleep at least three more kids easily. There was plenty of room to hang damp ski clothes and to scatter toys brought from home. Elizabeth and I were in an adjoining en suite bedroom - also surprisingly large, with modern furnishings, contemporary decor and a large bathroom with shower and bath. We were on the third floor, conveniently just along the corridor from the boot room from which you can ski straight on to the piste. Rosy-cheeked and fearless: Jack, seven (left) and nine-year-old Thomas on the balcony of their room . The resort has a good-sized indoor swimming pool with a huge hot tub inside and another outside from which guests can admire the view and wave to skiers passing on a nearby gondola lift . There is a good-sized indoor swimming pool with a huge hot tub inside and another outside from which you can admire the view and wave to skiers passing on a nearby gondola lift. Thomas and Jack were always keen to go swimming – even after a long day skiing - and I found it a great way to relax. The peaceful spa, which overlooks the pool has a steam room and sauna and two highly skilled masseurs, trained to melt away the aches and pains. Evening meals are organised so that children eat separately from their parents. I have heard sneering criticism of this kind of arrangement - cited as evidence that unlike others in Europe we English don't really like our kids - what rot! Our children relished the chance to lark about and swap tales of derring-do with new pals they'd made in ski school and would have been dead on their feet had they stayed up late enough to eat with us. The writer highly recommends the resort for those planning their  their first family skiing holiday . The ideally located resort had magnificent views across and down the pretty Tarentaise Valley . To be honest after a long day skiing it was a relief to simply hand them over at the restaurant at around 6pm and leave the staff to shepherd them through the noisy and raucous meal knowing that we could enjoy a quiet and relaxing five course feast, with wine, once they'd gone to bed. After dinner the fun continued for the children with lots of organised activities. You can sit back and let them run wild safe in the knowledge that they are loving every minute of it and are safe in the hands of the bright, young and enthusiastic staff who are all British. When it is time for the kids to go to bed a member of staff keeps a reassuring eye on them until you turn in yourself. The ever present army of Esprit Ski staff are the hotel's greatest asset. It was a delight to watch our boys shepherded off to ski school in the morning too busy and excited for goodbye kisses and good luck wishes. And what a joy to see them just two days into the holiday snaking their way down a blue run, rosy cheeked and fearless. As I looked on I was puffed up with fatherly pride and dying to give them a hug. At the Bellecote Glacier marvelling at the impressive ice sculptures in the Grottes de Glace, or ice caves . Memorable holiday: David puffed up with fatherly pride when he saw how well his children were skiing . I am not going to beat around the bush. If you are planning your first family skiing holiday and you want someone else to take the strain, you should stay here. Our boys loved ski school in the morning and were happy to join us on the slopes after lunch. The nursery slopes are a good size for those who need to build confidence and access to them is easy and efficient. It was holiday packed with memories I will treasure all my life. On one exciting outing we took a trip up to the top of Bellecote Glacier at 3,417m to see the impressive ice sculptures in the Grottes de Glace, or ice caves. Jack loves polar bears and was overjoyed to come face to face with one carved into to ice.The run down was too difficult for me and the boys so we came down in the bubble car while my wife skied and met us for a hot chocolate lower down in the valley. This year I'm sure the boys will be racing down with their mum - I'll stick to the bubble car.

"Love suits the Doctor. He might be likely to get both his alien hearts broken by his new time-travelling companion, Clara (Jenna-Louise Coleman), but he's full of the joys of spring. In this week's wild and witty episode of Doctor Who, he was kissing any girl who came within reach — a smacker on the forehead for Clara, a peck on the cheek for poor blind Ada, and a full-on scorcher on the lips for detective Jenny Flint. She slapped his face, of course. Just for form's sake. But the romantic twist has been a welcome wake-up slap for a much-loved TV institution that was getting tired. The first half of this series, last autumn, sagged badly in the middle as the storyline about his two previous companions, Rory and Amy, trudged on. Love suits: Matt Smith and Jenna-Louise Coleman, stars of Doctor Who, have produced some zingers . Rory was so wet, Amy was so impressed with herself, and the pair of them deserved to be parked permanently in a black hole. The Clara episodes, by contrast, are zingers. They crackle with fun and playfulness. And they are daring — the Doctor didn't appear until 14 minutes into the story on Saturday, and when he did it was a genuine shock. There were some good visual gags. Investigating a mysterious Lancashire mill in 1893, Clara broke into the cavernous engine hall to discover it was empty, apart from some gramophones playing the deafening sound of heavy machinery. For a flashback sequence, the Doctor — in tweeds and a high-crowned Derby hat — appeared in flickering sepia, as if shot on a hand-cranked motion picture camera. And best of all, when Jenny Flint took on a gang of brainwashed Victorian thugs, she stepped out of her crinolines to reveal a leather cat-suit — just like Mrs Peel in the cult Sixties series, The Avengers. It was no coincidence that the actress who played Emma Peel was cast here as the villainous Mrs Gillyflower — Dame Diana Rigg. The Dame was splendidly nasty as a temperance campaigner with a gigantic red leech from the Jurassic era suckling blood on her breastbone. 'Sheer pleasure': Shaun Evans as Endeavour Morse in the ITV Inspector Morse prequel Endeavour . But the best lines went to Jenny, the alien consulting-detective Vastra and the psychotic Sontaran valet, Strax. As the trio leapt into a Hansom cab in London, Strax reminded them of the dangers that lay ahead: 'I strongly advise the issuing of scissor grenades, limbo vapour and triple blast brain splitters. Remember, we are going to the North!' With Torchwood over and The Sarah Jane Adventures brought to an untimely end by the death of actress Elisabeth Sladen, there is space in the schedules for a new Doctor Who spin-off. These three characters deserve their own crime series — Vastra is a scaly green version of Sherlock Holmes, Jenny is her Watson and Strax is a lunatic Mrs Hudson. Good spin-offs are sheer pleasure, as Endeavour has proved. Like Doctor Who, this prequel to the crime classic Morse is television you can watch twice — once for the story, and again for the details. Watch carefully, and you spotted a push-along carpet cleaner, which was no more than a rotating brush and a pan on the end of a stick: we all had those, stored upright like a broom in the cupboard under the stairs. And short trousers on a snowy day: little boys weren't allowed to wear long trousers until they were 11, and never mind if it was below freezing ... good for the circulation. I spotted only one detail that would have made the set more authentic — in the newspaper office, the reporters had battered Imperial typewriters, but no sheaf of discarded papers on a metal spike where unwanted articles were left to die a death. The spike was the ultimate elf 'n' safety horror: ask any journalist of a certain vintage, and we'll tell you tales of hacks who spiked their own hands, elbows and even heads. Such scratches would mean nothing to young Morse, who during this short series has been stabbed, has almost fallen from a college roof, and who last night was shot in the hip. Another detail is revealed — now we know why, in later life, Morse was troubled by an old wound that made him limp. Take a note of that, Sergeant.","Doctor Who, BBC1, Saturday; Endeavour, ITV, Sunday ."
"Two leading women's charities have warned making it illegal for women to drink while they are pregnant could 'undermine their autonomy . Drinking during pregnancy could be classed as a criminal offence, in light of a landmark case due to be heard at the Court of Appeal tomorrow. A council in North West England is seeking criminal injuries compensation for a six-year-old girl with 'growth retardation', caused by her mother's alcohol consumption during pregnancy. If the court agrees that the woman committed a crime, it could pave the way for a pregnant woman's behaviour to be criminalised. However two women's charities have warned that any such ruling could 'seriously undermine women's autonomy while pregnant and their freedom to make decisions for themselves'. The case is of 'profound social significance' and could establish a legal precedent which could be used to prosecute women who drink while pregnant. There are fears it could mean other aspects of women's behaviour - such as medication taken during pregnancy or her choice of childbirth - could also have damning implications. Charities also fear women with addictions could choose to abort their unborn children rather than face criminal prosecution. Ann Furedi, chief executive of bpas, and Rebecca Schiller, co-chair of Birthrights, said: 'Making one particular form of behaviour during pregnancy into a criminal offence would lay the ground for criminalising a wide range of other behaviours because they may too pose a risk to the health of the baby.' Similar developments in the U.S. have resulted in women being imprisoned. As a result, the National Advocates for Pregnant Women in the country has urged caution over this UK case. It has called on the court to 'reject efforts to create criminal penalties as a mechanism for addressing health problems women may face during pregnancy'. Scroll down for video . In the case, to be heard this week, the little girl was born with Foetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), which can cause stunted growth, facial abnormalities and intellectual impairment. The syndrome was diagnosed 252 times in England between 2012 and 2013. But the charities claim that there is 'continuing uncertainty' in the medical profession over the relationship between drinking and harm to the foetus. And they say mothers and their babies would not be best served by treating pregnant women with drug or alcohol abuse problems as criminals. The Court of Appeal will decide if the mother of a six-year-old girl born with foetal alcohol syndrome committed a crime in drinking alcohol while she was pregnant. The case could set a legal precedent, criminalising women's behaviours while they are expecting . Lawyers representing the local authority are seeking to prove the six-year-old's mother committed a crime under the Offences Against the Persons Act 1861. The case will be heard at the Court of Appeal tomorrow. In January, it emerged they had failed in their bid to win compensation on the child's behalf from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA). A written ruling by the Upper Tribunal of the Administrative Appeals Chamber said the child was born with foetal alcohol spectrum disorder as a 'direct result' of her mother's drinking. Foetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) is a complex condition, denoting a collection of features including retarded growth, facial abnormalities and intellectual impairment. There remains uncertainty in the medical community over the relationship between alcohol consumption and harm to the foetus. While it occurs in babies born to alcoholic women, most babies of alcoholic women will not be affected, as other factors, including nutritional status, genetic make-up of mother and foetus, age and general health, are also thought to play a role. There were 252 diagnoses of FAS in England in 2012 to 2013. But it concluded: 'If (the girl) was not a person while her mother was engaging in the relevant actions then... as a matter of law, her mother could not have committed a criminal offence.' Neither the girl nor the mother was identified in the ruling. bpas and Birthrights said criminalising mothers is not the way to best help them or their children. Instead, pregnant women with addiction problems need rapid access to specialist support services, as do children born with disability caused by drug or alcohol abuse. Ms Furedi and Ms Schiller said: 'Viewing these cases as potential criminal offences will do nothing for the health of women and their babies. 'There is a strong public interest in promoting the good health of pregnant women and babies, but, as long-standing government policy recognises, this interest is best served by treating addiction and substance abuse in pregnancy as a public health, not criminal, issue. 'As well as undermining women's ability to make their own choices while pregnant, women with substance addictions may avoid engaging with health services or feel compelled to terminate their pregnancy rather than continue and face criminal sanctions. 'It could also make health professionals responsible for reporting women in their care to the police. 'Both the immediate and broader implications of this case are troubling.'","Court of Appeal will decide  if girl born with growth retardation, caused by her mother's drinking during pregnancy, should receive compensation .

"Celebrity chef Bill Granger has sold his spacious Californian-style bungalow in Sydney's beachside suburb of Bronte for about $3.5 million, just over a month after he opened a brand new restaurant at nearby Bondi Beach. Granger and wife Natalie Elliott, currently base in London, bought the four bedroom, two storey home on Yanko Avenue in 2008 for $2.88 million. Property agent Pauline Goodyer had quoted more than $3.3 million for the home ahead of Saturday's auction. The 590 square metre block is within walking distance of the sand and surf at Bronte beach and the popular new Bills Bondi restaurant. The house boasts 'idyllic' north-east facing gardens, period features and ocean views from the upper level. Of course, it also features a designer open plan kitchen and dining room, a reflection of the 'sunny, easy-going, generous' approach to food and dining that has made Granger and his restaurants so popular around the world. Celebrity chef Bill Granger's house in Bronte, east Sydney, has sold for about $3.5 million, just six weeks after he opened a brand new beachside restaurant at nearby Bondi . The four-bedroom, two storey home boasts private gardens and ocean views from the upper level . The open-plan kitchen and dining room of the Bronte home reflects the relaxed, communal approach to dining that has made Granger's restaurants so popular around the world . The generous wooden deck backs onto a luscious green garden, punctuated by palm trees, and bathes in sunlight . When Bills Bondi opened in September, the 45-year-old said: ‘It’s hard to believe that we’re only just opening in Bondi in 2014.' ‘Bondi beach and Bills go together like surfers and boardshorts, limes and mojitos, and … hotcakes and honeycomb butter? We can’t wait to welcome you into our newest urban beach house, at the very sunny heart of the fabulous city where it all began.’ The self-taught cook dropped out of art school at the age of 24 to open his first ‘Bills’ restaurant in Sydney’s Darlinghurst in 1992.

"A celebrity psychic has sacked her husband and son-in-law from their roles in her management team after they were filmed threatening and hurling homophobic abuse at a sceptic who was handing out leaflets outside her shows. Sally Morgan's husband, John Morgan, and son-in-law, Daren Wiltshear, were caught on camera by Mark Tilbrook as he stood outside a London theatre distributing leaflets that questioned whether psychics really could speak to the dead. Mr Morgan was shown approaching Mr Tilbrook, 30, and threatening him with violence if he did not leave, saying: 'I'm gonna knock you out sooner or later... 'So f*** off before I do you.' Scroll down for video . Sceptic Mark Tilbrook, right, was handing out leaflets outside Sally Morgan's live show when he was threatened . The psychic's husband John Morgan is seen on footage filmed by Mr Tilbrook hurling homophobic abuse at him . Menacing: When Mr Morgan threatens to attack Mr Tilbrook, he is joined by son-in-law Daren Wiltshear, above . Last night Mrs Morgan, 63, who styles herself as 'Britain's best-loved psychic' and who gave readings to the late Princess Diana, announced she had sacked her two family members after seeing the footage. She gave the news in a statement on her website, saying Mr Morgan and Mr Wiltshear will 'have nothing more to do with my business', and adding: 'Right now I honestly have no idea what is going to happen to my marriage.' The video, which has just been released to coincide with October being 'Psychic Awareness Month', was filmed outside the Shaw Theatre in north London in April this year, shortly before Mrs Morgan gave one of her 'Psychic Sally: On The Road' shows. Mr Tilbrook, who was handing out leaflets entitled 'Look After Yourself' to audience members attending in the hope the psychic might contact dead relatives, said he had a video camera because Mr Morgan had been 'threatening and abusive' at the two previous shows he had leafleted. The footage shows the psychic's husband coming up to him and telling him he was taking legal action against Mr Tilbrook. When Mr Tilbrook refused to leave, saying he was doing nothing wrong, Mr Morgan launched into a tirade of abuse, saying: 'I'm gonna knock you out one day because you are a nuisance... The tape, which was uploaded to YouTube, began showing Mr Morgan telling Mr Tilbrook he was suing him . But the encounter quickly soured, with the psychic's husband threatening Mr Tilbrook with physical violence . As Mr Morgan continues to threaten Mr Tilbrook, he is joined by his son-in-law and Mrs Morgan's tour manager . 'One day you're gonna be lifted and you'll disappear somewhere.' He went on: 'You're a prat and I'm losing my temper, because I'm gonna knock you out sooner or later. 'So f*** off before I do you.' He is seen continuing in this vein, becoming increasingly agitated despite Mr Tilbrook's refusal to fight back, saying: 'I'm gonna hit you in a minute.  I'm gonna knock you out.' At this point, Sally Morgan's son-in-law, then tour manager, Mr Wiltshear, approached and added: 'I've seen him do it and you really don't want him to do it.' Mr Morgan, who also threatened to 'flatten' Mr Tilbrook, hurled homophobic abuse at him as well, saying: ''You're a poof as well - we know all about your life.' He added: 'You know, you look pale.  Are you on drugs or has someone s****** you too much? 'One of your boyfriends been ** **** ****?' Mr Tilbrook put his footage, which he says bears at 2012 date stamp because he used a 'cheap camera', on YouTube, where it has had more than 120,000 views. 'You look pale': The abuse becomes homophobic, as Mr Tilbrook is accused of sleeping with various men . Initially Mrs Morgan apologised for the remarks made on the tape, and in a statement she put out on Friday accused Mr Tilbrook of 'persistent hounding', saying her husband had reacted 'angrily' because of his 'ever-growing concern' for her safety. However last night she published another statement, saying: 'I have come from a family background that has always been very accepting, many of my friends are gay and I have always felt happy that I am often referred to as a gay icon through my work. 'I am utterly ashamed and devastated at the behaviour of my husband John and son-in-law Daren, and neither of them will have anything to do with my work, my business, and right now I honestly have no idea what is going to happen to my marriage.' Enigmatically, the statement concluded: 'There will be many more important decisions being made over the course of this week.' Mr Tilbrook told MailOnline today that his leaflets were not specifically about Sally Morgan, saying: 'I just wanted those who were attending a psychic show to have all the information they needed to make an informed choice about whether psychics have real powers or whether they just appear to have them.' He added: 'From the very first time I was handing out leaflets on the street, John Morgan harassed and threatened me - telling me to ""F*** off before I floor you"". 'Not once did I ever approach him, and I would have preferred it if he had just left me alone.' Mr Tilbrook said Mr Morgan's behaviour was 'inexcusable', and said he was angry that Mrs Morgan had initially 'inferred what happened was justified because I was somehow ""hounding"" them.' He added: 'The reaction from Sally Morgan's team has been totally unjustified and threatened my right to free speech.' Mrs Morgan did not reply to MailOnline's requests for a comment.","Sceptic Mark Tilbrook was handing out leaflets outside psychic's live show .

"'Crying': Shrien Dewani (pictured earlier in the trial) told police that his wife Anni was the one who decided to visit a dangerous South African township on the night she was shot dead, a court heard today . Shrien Dewani told police that his wife Anni was the one who decided to visit a dangerous South African township on the night she was shot dead, a court heard today. In a statement provided to police just hours after the 2010 hijack, Dewani is quoted as saying: 'I think my wife talked to [taxi driver] Zola about the townships. 'Zola then took us into the townships because my wife told him that's what she wanted.' The claim was revealed to Cape Town's High Court by South African police officer George Stefanus, who said he interviewed Dewani around four hours after their car was ambushed by gunmen. Asked about the Briton's reactions at the time, Stefanus told the court: 'He was crying. What he also said was: ""I hope they didn't kill Anni"" and 'I hope Anni's okay"".' The policeman's recollections came on a torrid day for the prosecution, which argues that Dewani both planned and paid for his wife's murder on their honeymoon. Prosecutor Adrian Mopp had sought to reveal to the court a cache of 53 sexually charged e-mails sent to Dewani by an older man over a three-month period a year before Anni's death. The e-mails, Mr Mopp said, would help the court understand the prosecution's version of how Mrs Dewani died - a story, the lawyer admitted, that some 'may find peculiar'. Former Metropolitan Police IT expert Mark Roberts had flown to South Africa from Britain to present the e-mail evidence, which he discovered on Mrs Dewani's laptop computer. But before he was able to do so, Dewani's defence barrister Francois van Zyl objected to their disclosure, pointing out that the 34-year-old businessman already admits to being bisexual. 'This is communication between the accused and another person from June to August 2009 in which they discuss their sexual preferences - what one man wants to do the other', van Zyl told the court. 'Amongst this are two instances - maybe three - in which they clearly have discussions about whether to come out and also about marriage. 'It is clear that the accused is [sexually] conflicted. The advice from his friend is that commitment is serious but if that is what he wants, he would support him and so would his family.' Wealthy: The millionaire with his wife Anni, whom he is accused of murdering by hiring hitmen to stage a violent carjacking on their luxury honeymoon in South Africa four years ago . Van Zyl admitted that while the 17 pages worth of email messages contain a wealth of detail about Mr Dewani's sexual activity, they should have no bearing on his murder case - particularly since they were sent only shortly after Dewani first met his wife-to-be. Prosecutor Adrian Mopp argued however that they should be revealed because they show how Shrien Dewani was 'confused' about his sexuality. 'But we know he was confused!', said Judge Jeanette Traverso before ruling that the emails should remain secret. Murder scene: The taxi where Anni Dewani's body was found in the  Cape Town township of Gugulethu . Mrs Dewani was murdered on the evening of November 13, 2010, after the taxi she and her husband were travelling in was hijacked in the dangerous Cape Town township of Gugulethu. The taxi's two hijackers ejected first the driver, Zola Tongo, and then Shrien Dewani before heading deep into the Cape Town townships where they killed Anni with a single bullet to the neck. Shrien Dewani, who spent four years fighting extradition from the UK to South Africa to face trial, denies all involvement in the crime. His murder trial, which started last week, was adjourned until next Monday after Cape Town's High Court heard that one of the prosecution lawyers had fallen ill.","Millionaire revealed wife's wishes in statement hours after taxi was carjacked .

"More than 3,100 students — nearly half of them athletes — enrolled in classes they didn't have to show up for and received artificially inflated grades in what an investigator called a 'shadow curriculum' that lasted nearly two decades at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The report released Wednesday by former high-ranking U.S. Justice Department official Kenneth Wainstein found more far-reaching academic fraud than previous investigations by the school and the NCAA. Many at the university hoped Wainstein's investigation would bring some closure to the long-running scandal, which is rooted in an NCAA investigation focused on improper benefits within the football program in 2010. Instead, findings of a systemic problem in the former African and Afro-American Studies department could lead to NCAA sanctions and possible dismissal of additional UNC staff. Too good to be true: It has been revealed that more than 3,100 University of North Carolina students, nearly half of whom were athletes, received artificially high grades through a 'shadow curriculum' which operated at the school, according to a report released Wednesday . Evidence: Kenneth Wainstein lead the investigation into claims the staff designed classes to keep certain students, like athletes, from flunking out. Pictured above at a news conference announcing the report on Wednesday . 'I think it's very clear that this is an academic, an athletic and a university problem,' chancellor Carol Folt said. The report outlined courses in the former African and Afro-American Studies department that required only a research paper that was often scanned quickly and given an A or B regardless of the quality of work. The school's board of trustees and the panel that oversees the state's university system reviewed Wainstein's findings during a closed-door meeting earlier Wednesday. A half-dozen officials and UNC Athletics Director Bubba Cunningham declined to say whether anyone would lose their job. The NCAA hit the football program in 2012 with scholarship reductions and a postseason ban, though the academic violations focused mainly on a tutor providing improper help to players on papers. The NCAA said it reopened its investigation in June because new information was available. Wainstein's staff has briefed NCAA investigators at least three times, plans another briefing on the final report and has 'enjoyed a strong cooperative relationship,' according to the report. The report outlined how the fraud ran unchecked for so long, as well as how faculty and administration officials missed or looked past red flags such as unusually high numbers of independent study course enrollments. It said athletics staffers steered athletes to classes that also became popular with fraternities and other everyday students looking for an easy grade. University Chancellor Carol Folt keeps her head down as she prepares to address members of the media about the academic irregularities on October 22 . 'By the mid-2000s, these classes had become a primary — if not the primary — way that struggling athletes kept themselves from having eligibility problems,' the report said. The school hired Wainstein in February. Unlike previous inquiries by former Gov. Jim Martin and the school, Wainstein had the cooperation of former department chairman Julius Nyang'oro and retired office administrator Deborah Crowder — the two people blamed for the irregularities. Nyang'oro was indicted in December on a felony fraud charge, though it was dropped after he agreed to cooperate with Wainstein's probe. Crowder was never charged. It was Crowder who started the paper classes as a way to help struggling students with 'watered-down requirements' not long after Nyang'oro became chairman of the curriculum in 1992, according to the report. Though not a faculty member, she managed the courses by registering students, assigning them topics and then handing out high grades regardless of the work. By 1999, in an apparent effort to work around the number of independent studies students could take, Crowder began offering lecture classes that didn't meet and were instead paper classes. After her retirement in 2009, Nyang'oro graded papers 'with an eye to boosting' a student's grade-point average, even asking Crowder's successor to look up GPAs before he'd issue a grade for a course, according to the report. UNC President Tom Ross shares a private conversation with Cancellor Folt at a meeting on the investigation Wednesday . Nyang'oro stepped down in 2011 as chairman after accusations of undetected plagiarism surfaced against a former football player. In all, athletes made up about 47 percent of the enrollments in the 188 lecture-classified paper classes. Of that group, 51 percent were football players. Wainstein's staff reviewed records dating to the 1980s and interviewed 126 people, including men's basketball coach Roy Williams, who said he trusted the school 'to put on legitimate classes,' according to the report. Former basketball player Rashad McCants, who told ESPN in June that tutors wrote research papers for him and that Williams was aware that of no-show classes, didn't respond to numerous requests for interviews, according to the report.","Report released Wednesday reveals more than 3,100 students  received artificially inflated grades from classes designed to boost their GPA .

"For the first time ever, the United States government is acknowledging the existence of the enigmatic military base in the southern Nevada desert famously known as Area 51. But its purpose, according to recently released documents, is far less spectacular than most UFO enthusiasts would have hoped. The National Security Archive at George Washington University recently published a report entitled 'The Secret History of the U-2.' It chronicles the history and importance of the spy planes that were frequently used during the Cold War. In their research for the report, the NSA the researchers obtained declassified documents about the planes that actually reference Area 51 on several occasions - as well as a map of the secret base. The documents were obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request made in 2005. It does exist! For the first time ever, the United States government acknowledges that Area 51 exists . Area 51 typically is associated with governmental secrecy, particularly . in terms of UFOs and extra terrestrials. Conspiracy theorists often . claim that a downed alien spacecraft is being held and studied in the . facility, based more on the fact that the government has - until now - . never acknowledged that the base exists and kept the goings on inside . its walls a secret than actual, documented facts. Of the many UFO theories, conspiracy buffs also believe the site was used to - among other things - hold meetings with extraterrestrial life forms, design exotic energy weapons, develop means for weather control, develop time travel and host meetings of the shadowy Majestic 12 one world government organization. In developing the U-2, the government needed a secret - and reliable - test facility somewhere in the United States. On April 12, 1955, scouts were flying over the Nevada desert when they spotted Groom Lake, according to 'The Central Intelligence Agency and Overhead Reconnaissance,' an . internal CIA history of the U-2 program written by Gregory . W. Pedlow and Donald E. Welzenbach that was declassified when the NSA submitted their FOIA request. Secretive: In 1955, the U.S. government needed a secret place to test the U-2 spy plane . The CIA chose Groom Lake in Nevada and brought the first U-2s there in July of 1955 . Cold War: The U-2 played enormous role in the Cold War and flew countless missions over the former Soviet Union and Cuba . 'On 12 April 1955, Richard Bissell and Col. Osmund Ritland (the . senior Air Force officer on the project staff) flew over Nevada with . Kelly Johnson on a small Beechcraft plane piloted by Lockheed’s chief . test pilot, Tony LeVier,' the document reads. 'They . spotted what appeared to be an airstrip by a salt flat known as Groom . Lake, near the northeast corner of the Atomic Energy Commission’s (AEC) Nevada Proving Ground.' The men agreed that Groom Lake was the perfect spot for the new, top-secret base, and asked the AEC to add it to its real estate holdings in Nevada. Conspiracy: UFO junkies believe the government is hiding a crashed alien spacecraft at Area 51 . The Perfect Spot: Scouts looking for a place to test the U-2 decided Groom Lake - later Area 51 - was the perfect spot . 'President Eisenhower also approved the addition of this strip of wasteland, known by its map designation as Area 51, to the Nevada Test Site,' the history continues. 'The outlines of Area 51 are shown on current unclassified maps as a small rectangular area adjoining the northeast corner of the much larger Nevada Test Site. To make the new facility in the middle of nowhere sound more attractive to his workers, Kelly Johnson called it the Paradise Ranch, which was soon shortened to the Ranch.' The first planes were delivered to Area 51 on July 25, 1955, and the trials began two days later. The first documented test flight occurred on August 4, 1955. The employees who worked at the base actually were flown in from Burbank, California on Monday mornings and returned on Friday afternoons, beginning on October 3, 1955. The Air Force took over the base when the CIA was done with it in 1957, and continued using it as a training ground for U-2 pilots. The new declassified documents don't reveal any earth-shattering details, but as Jeffrey Richelson, a senior fellow with the National Security Archive who found the documents, points out, 'It marks an end of official secrecy about the facts of Area 51 . 'It opens up the possibility that future accounts of this and other aerial projects will be less redacted, more fully explained in terms of their presence in Area 51,” he tells the Las Vegas Sun.","The government says Area 51 was developed so the CIA could test Cold War-era U-2 spy planes .

"Russell Bishop, cleared of the famous 'Babes in the Wood' murders, could now be freed from a life sentence he was later given for the rape and attempted murder of another young girl . The child sex attacker who was the prime suspect in the notorious 'Babes in the Wood' murders in 1986 could soon walk free from jail. Tragic Nicola Fellows, 10, and Karen Hadaway, nine, went missing 28 years ago today and their bodies were later found in a park in Brighton, East Sussex. Russell Bishop, then 19, was found not guilty of the killings a year later but was jailed for life for the attempted murder and rape of another young girl in 1991. Now Justice Secretary  Chris Grayling has approved his case for review in a decision which could see Bishop walk free from prison. Nicola and Karen, who were neighbours on an estate in Brighton, were last seen alive on October 9, 1986, after going out to play. Relatives and friends, including Bishop, also from Brighton, joined more than 150 police officers in a hunt for the girls. They were found strangled in the city's Wild Park the next day, huddled together with Karen's head resting on her friend's lap. Police believed they knew their killer and arrested Bishop - then a teenager who lodged at Nicola's house for a short time - three weeks later. He was charged with double murder but was cleared at a trial at Lewes Crown Court in December 1987. Bishop was later sentenced to life imprisonment after being convicted of the abduction, molestation and attempted murder of a seven-year-old girl. He is serving a life sentence for those crimes and is one of the longest-serving prisoners in the country not convicted of murder. The latest decision by the Justice Secretary will see a ruling on whether he should be released from the prison within six months. Nicola Fellows (left) and Karen Hadaway (right) were found dead in a park in Brighton, East Sussex in 1986 . The girls' disappearance sparked a huge search, involving more than 150 police officers and scores of locals . A statement from the parole board said: 'We can confirm that it has received a referral of Russell Bishop's case from the Secretary of State for Justice and that his case is currently under review.' Bishop has always denied the murders, but his potential freedom comes as a blow to the girls' families, who remember them at the scene of their death each year. Nicola's uncle, Nigel Heffron, 60, recently spoke of his 'frustration' at the lack of answers over the crime. Mr Heffron said: 'Each year we hold a vigil in the park by the memorial and go there to remember them. 'It is a cold case. We haven't had any updates from the police. Each year goes into the other and we still look for answers.' Mr Heffron's brother, Ian, has  said of Bishop's potential freedom: 'This is something that stops Nicky and Karen's families from being able to get on with their lives, even after this long. 'Every two years we have to go through this. We need him to be locked up for life and to get justice for Nicky and Karen to ever get any closure.' The girls' families say they are frustrated the case has still not been solved 28 years later . October 1986 - Nicola and Karen were snatched off the street close to their homes in the Moulsecoomb estate in Brighton after going out to play. Their bodies were found the following day, huddled together in a nearby park. Bishop, who knew both girls, was arrested three weeks later. December 1987 - A jury took a little over two hours to find the roof tiler  Bishop, then 19, not guilty of the murders. 1991 - Bishop was jailed for life for the kidnap, sexual assault and attempted murder of a seven-year-old girl from Brighton two miles from where Nicola and Karen were found. 2005 - A repeal of double jeopardy laws meant Bishop could have faced a fresh trial if substantial evidence came to light, but the following year, the High Court ruled there was not enough evidence. 2014 - Justice Secretary Chris Grayling approves his case for parole for review. A decision is expected in the next six months. Police in Sussex say the 'important' case is regularly reviewed and they hope forensic technology may help .","Nicola Fellows, 10, and Karen Hadaway, nine, found dead 28 years ago .

"Shabazz Suleman is feared to have fled to Syria to join ISIS militants . An 18-year-old boy in the middle of A-level preparation is the latest youngster feared to have fled to Syria to join jIhadists. Shabazz Suleman left his home in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, earlier this year while on study leave for his exams from the town's Royal Grammar School. It is not yet known whether Shabazz has gone to carry out aid work or fight. Thames Valley Police confirmed it was working with Royal Grammar School, rated outstanding by Ofsted, since his departure. Counter terrorism officers are reportedly planning a visit, as it was revealed a Twitter account used by Shabazz to post Islamic content has been removed. Former pupils at the school include England rugby players Nick Beale, Matt Dawson, and Tom Rees, in addition to golfer Luke Donald and the late rugby player Nick Duncombe. A letter sent to parents of pupils informed them the force's Prevention Team would be visiting to give youngsters a talk. 'I wish to reassure you that we are working with the relevant authorities and will continue to do so. 'We are also aware that there will be interest amongst the school and we have arranged for all pupils at the school to be spoken to by ‘The Prevent Team’ from Thames Valley Police,' head teacher Roy Page, wrote. 'Shabazz was a pupil at the Royal Grammar School High Wycombe from September 2007 until May 2014, when he left on examination leave to take his A levels in Economics, Psychology and History. 'We have fully cooperated with the relevant authorities and will continue to do so.' Scroll down for video . Supt Ed Mclean, Local Police Area Commander for Wycombe, said: 'Whilst I would not look to comment on any specific case I would like to say that my team have been liaising and supporting the Royal Grammar School and we continue to work with the communities of Wycombe to identify and prevent vulnerable people from travelling to Syria by highlighting the associated dangers. 'I would encourage anyone who is concerned that persons may be planning to travel to Syria to contact us or trusted community leaders. 'Anyone who does travel to Syria will find themselves the focus of a police investigation.' The 18-year-old (right) left Buckinghamshire after going on study leave for his A Levels in May . Shabazz was a pupil at The Royal Grammar School High Wycombe which is said to be working with police . A friend of the Shabazz, who did not want to be named, said he had spoken with the youngster about the situation in Syria where extremist Islamic militants have waged a campaign of violence against civilians, military troops and rebel fighters. 'Before leaving to go to Syria, I spoke to him at length about what he thought of the situation over there - and he expressed support for what he called the Islamic Caliphate,' he told the Tab newspaper. But the boy's mother insisted her son had gone to Syria to offer aid in conflict zones. Wycombe MP Steve Baker said he was aware someone from the community may have gone over to Iraq or Syria and strongly advised people not to travel to those areas. Mr Baker said: 'I was aware there was a possibility a person had gone over. I’m also aware that it’s not known whether he is fighting or delivering aid. 'He has apparently previously been involved in providing aid in Syria. Yusra Hussein (left) is suspected of fleeing Britain to join ISIS in Syria. The 15-year-old's mother (right) has made an emotional plea for her to come home . 'In any event it’s not advisable for anyone to travel to Iraq or Syria. I am very grateful to the whole Muslim community in denouncing IS. 'It’s absolutely clear they are denouncing ISIL and the task and responsibility of all politicians is to hold our community together so that all our people can flourish. 'Clearly the departure of people from Wycombe to Syria is a challenge for us. 'I stood up in the Commons and said that the first young man had acted disgracefully towards our community and the Prime Minister agreed. 'I am absolutely convinced that the vast majority of British Muslims just want to live their lives in peace. It’s critical that we all unite to combat extremism.' The boy's mother has denied claims he has travelled to the Middle East for violent reasons, telling the press: 'He has gone to do aid work there'. It comes as the mother of 15-year-old Yusra Hussein made an emotional plea for her daughter to come home. The schoolgirl from Bristol is feared to have fled to Syria to either join ISIS fighters or was lured there after joining a jihadist dating website.","Shabazz Suleman left home in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, in May .

Tahmooressi’s detention brought calls for his freedom from US politicians, veterans groups and social media campaigns. A US congressional committee held a hearing on the case. In Mexico, possession of weapons restricted for use by the Army is a federal crime, and the country has been tightening up its border checks to stop the flow of US weapons that have been used by drug cartels. In his truck when he crossed the US-Mexico border in March, Tahmooressi was carrying a rifle, shotgun, pistol and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. His attorney, Fernando Benitez, argued that Tahmooressi carries loaded guns with him because his weapons, which were bought legally in the US, make him feel safer. He added that the veteran is often distracted, which could have contributed to him becoming lost. In his order issued last Friday, a Mexican judge did not make a determination on the illegal arms charges against Tahmooressi but freed him because of his mental state, according to a statement from Mexico's embassy in the US.","Andrew Tahmooressi, 26, was released from jail October 31 and returned to Florida the following day .

"A Chinese holidaymaker unwittingly sparked a biosecurity scare at New Zealand’s busiest airport after snake fillets were discovered in a package thought to contain tea. A sealed plastic bag containing the snake meat was packed by the tourist’s mother and was ‘crawling with insects’ when it was opened by a quarantine inspector at Auckland Airport last week. Government officials said the woman presented the seemingly innocent package upon landing and was not certain that it actually contained tea. Scroll down for video . Snake bite: A package containing python fillets sparked a biosecurity scare at Auckland Airport last week . Python fillets, bottom right, are sold at an outdoor market . Brett Hickman, detection technology manager for New Zealand’s Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI), said: ‘It became clear the contents were definitely not tea when our quarantine inspector opened the package and discovered fresh fillets labelled as python. ‘The meat could have had diseases damaging to our native reptiles. And contributing to the biosecurity risk, it was crawling with insects.’ After the unusual discovery the airport raised its biosecurity alarm as a precaution. MPI did not fine the passenger as she had declared the item. The holidaymaker declared the package upon landing but did not know that it contained exotic snake meat . Mr Hickman said: ‘She did the right thing by alerting us she was carrying food items, and we congratulate her for that.’ MPI gave the confiscated python fillets to the country’s Department of Conservation as it may be subject to the Trade in Endangered Species Act. Mr Hickman said quarantine inspectors regularly intercept ‘biosecurity risk items’ in misleading packaging. The Department of Conservation seized the snake meat as it may be subject to an endangered species act . He said: ‘A lot of stuff from some countries gets vacuum-packed in whatever packaging a shop happens to have at the time. 'It means our inspectors have to open everything they are not sure about. ‘We don’t see a lot of snake products like this, although occasionally we find snakes preserved in bottles of wine from places like Thailand and Vietnam.’","Passenger's mum slipped snake meat into a package though to contain tea .

"For most people, dangling over the edge of the tallest man-made structure in the U.S. is a terrifying prospect. But this is what several daring workers were doing today as they took stain samples from the 'stainless' steel surface of the Gateway Arch in St Louis. The first stage of the sampling, costing $340,000 in total, saw men rappel down the 630ft monument's west face for the first time in its 49-year history. They removed rust-colored stains from its surface, before sending them to the National Park Service for testing in a bid to figure out what is causing them. Scroll down for video . Daring: A construction worker dangles from a rope as he takes stain samples from the 'stainless' steel surface of Gateway Arch in St Louis .

Above, the man was dangling near the top of the Arch, which is the tallest man-made structure in the U.S . In the past, officials have struggled to find the source of the mysterious stains, with engineers across the U.S. agreeing the Arch should be cleaned soon. This has been deemed particularly important as the iconic Missouri monument has not been cleaned since it was first topped off in 1965. So, to obtain samples of steel to test, construction employees were forced to dangle over the side of the famous Arch from ropes, STL Today reported. They were then required to use suction cups to hold themselves in place while they took samples from the west side of the monument's north leg.

However, the work has not always been plain sailing - construction companies have been forced to delay the project several times due to  weather. In the past week, strong winds and heat from the sun beating down on the Arch's metal sides have led to the sampling being put back.

"An incredibly offensive selection of costumes offers men the chance to dress up as 'fat women' this Halloween. The costume collections, which are available through a variety of online retailers, including Amazon.com, feature designs such as 'Tinker Belly', 'sexy fat cheerleader' and 'fat fairy' - there's even a 'fat lap dancer'. Many of the outfits are designed and sold by online costume retailer Fun World, who proudly feature the costumes in the 'humorous' category of their website. Fun or offensive? Two of the fat women costumes available include a 'sexy fat cheerleader' or a 'plus size Miss Oktoberfest' Bad-taste Baywatch: Many of the costumes, including this take on popular TV show Baywatch, are sold on Amazon.com . Other brands such as Smiffy's, Rubie's Costume Company and Forum Novelties, all offer their own takes on the offensive costume trend. Lisa Wade, professor of sociology at Occidental College, expressed her outrage at the outfits in a piece on The Huffington Post. 'An excellent piece of evidence that femininity is hilarious or ridiculous in U.S. culture, or even frightening or disgusting, is the fact that men use the category ""woman"" as a Halloween costume,' she wrote. 'Many costume manufacturers (or homemade costume makers, for that matter) add fat hatred to the mix. Because there is nothing more disgusting and hilarious, we are told, than a fat woman. 'Except, perhaps, a fat woman who fails to be properly humiliated.' Earlier this week, Walmart came under fire after describing its plus size women's Halloween range as 'Fat Girl Costumes'. It is believed that an employee working for the store, which later apologized for the incident, posted the offensive description on its website in error.

Bad taste: Many of the outfits, including this stripper costume (left), are designed and sold by online costume retailer Fun World, who proudly feature the costumes in the 'humorous' category of their website .

'We worked to remove it as soon as possible and we will ensure this never happens again.' Wonder Woman, The Queen of Hearts, a witch and a female vampire were among the costumes in the section. The retailer removed the rude category after it sparked an outcry on social media.

"The boyfriend of a woman whose remains were found in 55-gallon plastic drum filled with concrete hidden in a storage facility has been charged with her murder. Scott Wobbe, 37, of Westland, Michigan, is accused of killing 22-year-old Theresa DeKeyzer of Warren. Wobbe, who's been jailed on a probation violation in Midland County, has been charged with first-degree murder, kidnapping and dismemberment or mutilation of a body. Scott Wobbe (pictured) is arraigned on charges of first-degree murder, kidnapping and mutilation of a dead body in the death of Theresa DeKeyzer, 22, in mid-June near her Warren home . Police found DeKeyzer's (pictured) body at a Detroit-area storage facility three months after she was reported missing . He was arraigned and held without bond Tuesday morning, reports Mlive.com. Her family appeared at Warren's 37th District Court for the hearing - her mother Marie Dekeyzer wore a t-shirt with the words 'Justice for Theresa' across the front as did other supporters. Police found DeKeyzer's body at a Detroit-area storage facility in September, three months after she was reported missing. Wobbe reported that he last saw DeKeyzer on June 16 near her Warren home - he was the last person confirmed to have seen her. Marie Dekeyzer, second left, mother of Theresa DeKeyzer, is supported by family members during the arraignment of Wobbe, at Warren's 37th District Court . DeKeyzer's family launched a campaign after she was reported missing to find her . In her home, police found that she had left behind her cellphone charger, a half-finished cigarette resting in an ashtray, and a medical marijuana card prescribed for depression/anxiety. Wobbe reported that he last saw DeKeyzer on June 16 near her Warren home . Her body was found at Travel Trailer Storage in Plymouth Township after Warren police executed a search warrant, Plymouth Township detective Charlie Rozum said . DeKeyzer was identified by her tattoos, clothing, and jewelry. There were also crime scene photos available from a domestic assault reported the day on June 15 before her disappearance when, according to police, a drunken Wobbe assaulted her. Wobbe reportedly dragged her out of his car by her shirt and punched her in the face. A neighbor intervened, and he had fled by the time police arrived. At some point during the night, DeKeyzer apparently walked to a gas station for cigarettes. Wobbe told police he picked DeKeyzer up from the gas station and they went back to his house and made up, the Detroit News reported. Wobbe told police he dropped DeKeyzer off, at her request, near Nine Mile and Van Dyke at 6 a.m. on June 16. DeKeyzer's aunt, Kathi Olechowski told CBS Detroit: 'We knew the suspect who should've been looked at right away, and it took the police awhile to listen to us; but it looks like he's finally gonna get his due, and we're ecstatic about it,' Olechowski said. 'Why she went back to him we'll never understand, but, I mean, who else were they gonna look at? I mean, honestly…he's nothing but trouble, that guy.' Wobbe faces life in prison if convicted on the murder charge.

"Pot of gold: The elaborate Japonisme urn which was initially valued on the Antiques Roadshow at £10,000 . It was a wedding gift that for years was commandeered as a goalpost by his children – so Terry Nurrish was stunned when this ornament was valued at £10,000 on the Antiques Roadshow in 1991. But the retired farmer decided to keep hold of the antique for a just little longer... and it turned out to be a wise decision. It has now sold at auction for a staggering £668,000, the most expensive sale price of any item valued on the long-running show. Mr Nurrish, 68, was given the ‘jardiniere’ by his parents, who picked it up as part of a £100 ‘job lot’ of antiques in 1946. Unbeknown to the family, it was a French ‘Japonisme’ enamel and bronze ornament made in 1874 by the renowned Christofle for the Paris Exhibition. Over the years his children kicked footballs at it in their dining room, as thanks to its long thin stand it measured up at 5ft tall, making it a perfect goalpost. Mr Nurrish, from Fulstow near Grimsby, first took the jardiniere to BBC1’s Antiques Roadshow, where Eric Knowles valued it at £10,000. He then kept it for more than 20 years, before eventually deciding to sell it at auction at Christie’s in London. After giving money to his family and paying for holidays and a BMW, Mr Nurrish returned to the Antiques Roadshow 23 years later to tell his story. Scroll down for video . In an episode due to be broadcast on Sunday, he told Mr Knowles and presenter Fiona Bruce: ‘My parents went to this house clearance sale and my mother saw the plant pot and fell in love with it. 'My brother and sister never took an interest in it but I really liked it, and when I got married my mother gave it to us as a present. Stunned: Terry Nurrish, left, with expert Eric Knowles and the valuable ornament on the programme in 1991 . Return: Terry Nurrish, centre, returned to the show to share his story with Eric Knowles, left, and Fiona Bruce . ‘We kept it in the dining room and our son used to use it as a goalpost. It was only when I took it to the Antiques Roadshow that I realised it was valuable. Even then I kept it for over 20 years because my mother always loved it. ‘But I realised I couldn’t just leave it to one person, so decided to sell it and share the proceeds. 'The auctioneer started the bidding at £100,000 and I just thought “blimey”. Then it kept going and I was getting redder and redder in the face. It was incredible.’ But despite the urn’s high sale price, Mr Knowles insisted he didn’t undervalue the pot in 1991, saying: ‘Back then, there was not the same demand… it’s a market that has sprung out of nowhere. 'My estimate may seem on the low side, but the auction estimate was £60,000 to £80,000. So it made half a million more than the auction estimate.’","Mr Nurrish's parents bought pot as part of £100 'job lot' of antiques in 1946 .

"FBI agents created a fake news story mimicking The Seattle Times web page and used it to capture a suspect in a series of bomb threats there in 2007. The agents created a fake Associated Press story and posted in on a bogus website 'in the style of The Seattle Times,' the newspaper said. The piece was about a series of bomb threats being called into Timberline High School in Lacey, located an hour south of Seattle. Police there had asked the FBI to help them find the suspect after the school had to be evacuated twice after a number of threats were called in. The Seatle Times says FBI agents created a fake news story resembling its style to catch a suspect in a series of bomb threats to a local high school . FBI agents baited the story with tracking software that reveals the location of a person who clicks on it. Then they sent it to the suspect's MySpace account — and eventually arrested an unnamed juvenile on June 14, 2007. The allegations were revealed in documents obtained by the Electronic Frontier Foundation in San Francisco. Seattle Times Editor Kathy Best was furious.

'Not only does that cross a line, it erases it.' 'Our reputation and our ability to do our job as a government watchdog are based on trust,' she added. 'Nothing is more fundamental to that trust than our independence — from law enforcement, from government, from corporations and from all other special interests.

"Australia’s national security service has warned against banning the burqa, claiming it would only bring ‘negative’ consequences for the country. ASIO said that preventing Muslim women from being allowed to choose if they want to wear the full body covering in public would only increase ‘tensions and distrust between communities’. The news comes after Senator Jacqui Lambie unveiled her wish to make it illegal to wear the burqa in public, unless the individual was wearing it for newly specified reasons. In a report sent to police and government departments, obtained by the Sydney Morning Herald, ASIO strongly stated that a burqa ban would provide ‘further fuel for extremist propaganda, recruitment, and radicalisation efforts.’ Scroll down for video . ASIO has warned against banning the burqa in Australia in a report sent to police and government departments . ASIO noted that stopping women wearing a burqa in public could lead them to become isolated at home. There are also reportedly fears that banning the clothing could stop the agency’s best community sources from coming to ASIO with information, but this was not stated in the report. On Monday, it emerged Senator Lambie had submitted a draft Private Members Bill to parliament that would impose jail time and fines of up to $68,000 for adults who force children to wear a burqa in public. The Private Members bill, if introduced, would also see severe fines and prison sentences for forcing an adult to wear a full face covering, with a fine of $34,000 or six months in prison. In the bill, the Palmer United Senator wrote: ‘For basic security reasons and the need for assimilation, identity-concealing garments should not be allowed in Australian public or Parliament house.’ Senator Lambie has submitted a draft Private Members Bill to parliament to stop women wearing the burqa . She proposed that on the spot fines should be issued to members of the public who breach the laws. ‘Any person who is deemed by a police officer to have worn any identity concealing garments in public unlawfully, will be issued with an on the spot fine or charged with an offence which carries a maximum fine of $3,400,' she said. Ms Lambie added that the system would be ‘very simple and similar to way traffic infringements are handled by police'. She said the only exception for wearing facial coverings was in private places of worship, for reasons of anonymity and on health or professional grounds. My Lambie also addressed the stunt in Monday, which saw three men attempt to enter Australia's Parliament House wearing a Ku Klux Klan hood, a niqab and a motorcycle helmet. Prime Minister Tony Abbott  backed down on plans proposed by Speaker Bronwyn Bishop and Senate President Stephen Parry to ban the body covering in Parliament . 'The facial covering farce and stunt which occurred in Parliament house yesterday, was caused by a leadership failure created by the PM and the Liberal National Parties.' Earlier this month, radical new measures were announced by Parliament House that were set to force women wearing the burqa to sit in an enclosed room behind glass screens. However, Prime Minister Tony Abbott then backed down on the plans proposed by Speaker Bronwyn Bishop and Senate President Stephen Parry. Mr Abbott is said to have been forced to ask Ms Bishop and Mr Parry to reconsider the plan due to extreme public backlash. The PM previously sparked controversy when he called the burqa 'confronting', claiming 'frankly I wish it weren't worn'.","ASIO has stated the negative effects of a burqa ban in Australia .

"Chantae Gilman pleaded not guilty to rape at King County Superior Court, Seattle, after being accused of breaking assaulting a man as he slept . A mother-of-three accused of breaking into a man's apartment, pinning him down and raping him while he slept has pleaded not guilty. Chantae Marie Gilman, 26, appeared at King County Superior Court, Seattle, accused of climbing into bed with a 31-year-old man and having  intercourse with him while he slept. The alleged victim, who did not know Gilman 'but recognised her as a drug user in the area', woke to find her on top of him, pinning his hands down over his head, according to the charges. He said he asked her to get off him during the attack in June 2013, but she refused, telling him 'to be quiet', court papers say. The 31-year-old man from West Seattle was able to force his way out from under her and told her to leave, but she refused again and asked for a cigarette. He pushed her out the door and threw a cigarette at her, slamming his door shut, they say. The charges don't indicate how Gilman was able to gain entry into the man's residence. He later went to Harborview Medical Center for a sexual-assault examination, and female DNA was recovered during the exam, charging papers say. Gilman, who recently gave birth to a baby girl, was a month into a  drug and mental-health treatment programme when she was booked into  the King County Jail, Seattle, on Tuesday. A motion by a defense attorney  to reduce her $100,000 bail was denied by King County Superior Court Judge Patrick Oishi. The alleged victim had a sexual-assault examination at Harborview Medical Center after the attack and female DNA was recovered, charging papers say. Gilman was interviewed by police but said she did not recall being in the man's home or having sex with him. The alleged victim, who did not know Gilman (pictured) 'but recognised her as a drug user in the area', woke to find her on top of him, pinning his hands down over his head, according to the charges . She told a Seattle police detective she suffers from bipolar disorder and psychosis, according to charging papers. At some point, Gilman provided a DNA sample, which was later matched by scientists at the State Patrol crime lab to the DNA from the man's sexual-assault exam. According to a letter in the court record written by the clinical supervisor of the Spokane drug-treatment program, Gilman arranged for Child Protective Services to provide respite care for her newborn daughter while she is in custody awaiting trial. According the the police report, on the night of the attack the man had attended a birthday party for a neighbor known to Gilman. 'Once arriving home he fell asleep on his bed,' reported Detective Roger Ishimitsu. 'Victim slept very hard due to a long day.' He woke at 2 a.m. to find the 5'7''. 240-pound Gilman on top of him with his erect penis inside of her. His hands had been 'pinned down over his head,' according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.

"The childhood home of novelist Dame Daphne Du Maurier has been put on the market for £32million. Cannon Hall, where the English author and playwright moved with her family when she was nine years old, is a six-bedroom, Grade II-listed home near Hampstead Heath in north London. The family moved to the 18th century home in 1916 and the Rebecca author's father, actor Sir Gerald du Maurier, lived there until his death in 1934. Stately: Daphne du Maurier's childhood home in Hampstead Heath, north London, which she moved into when she was nine, has gone on the market for £32million . Rich history: One of the five reception areas in the huge home, where actor Sir Gerald du Maurier lived from 1916 until his death in 1934 . Pride of London: The home has been described as one of the finest in London, and boats a billiards room as well as a separate cottage in the grounds . The stately home, which dates from 1730 and is set among half an acre of land, was also used for filming Otto Preminger's 1965  thriller Bunny Lake Is Missing, starring Laurence Olivier. The house has three floors, and boasts an indoor swimming pool, a billiards room, five reception rooms and a separate cottage for staff. There is a former coachman's house with stables in the courtyard which has a weatherboard clock and turret. A blue plaque honouring Sir Gerald sits on an outside wall of the house he shared with his wife, the actress Muriel Beaumont. Ornate: The mid-eighteenth century style staircase, with twisted balusters and carved brackets, leads up to the gallery landing, which overlooks the hall below . Splashing out: The house, which has an indoor swimming pool, will cost any  buyer £32million, plus huge annual fees if Labour's mansion tax comes into force . Honoured: A blue plaque on the outside of the house to mark Sir Gerald du Maurier, Daphne's father, whose own father George was a Punch cartoonist . The current owners have now put Cannon Hall on the market with Glentree International and Savills for £32 million - making it one of the most expensive properties for sale in the capital. Prospective buyers also face an extra in £2million in stamp duty, plus a whopping annual bill if Labour were to introduce a 'mansion tax'. Trevor Abrahmsohn, boss of Glentree International, described Cannon Hall as 'one of the most cherished and historic residences in Hampstead'. He added: 'It must rank as one of the prize gems of the English Heritage stable. 'It is steeped in provenance and this is more an opportunity to buy a property that has remained in private hands for many decades than just another trophy home for sale. Film set: Cannon Hall, which dates from 1730, was also used for filming Otto Preminger's 1965 thriller Bunny Lake Is Missing, starring Laurence Olivier . Perfect setting: The mansion has half an acre of  beautiful gardens, but is also just four miles from London's West End . The grand entrance hall, which extends nearly the depth of the house, and the wide staircase are two of Cannon Hall's most impressive and distinguishing features. The staircase, created in the mid-eighteenth century style with twisted balusters and carved brackets, leads up to the gallery landing, which overlooks the hall below. Frank Townsend, from Savills, said: 'Cannon Hall is one of London's finest period homes. 'The property is located less than 50 yards from the rolling acres of Hampstead Heath, yet less than four miles from the heart of London's West End. 'There are only a handful of properties in Hampstead with the physical stature of Cannon Hall - and with the du Maurier and Olivier connections as well, certainly makes it the most iconic of them all.' Daphne du Maurier was born in 1907 to two famous actors - Sir Gerald du Maurier and Muriel Beaumont. Her elder sister Angela also became a writer, and her younger sister Jeanne was an artist. Her grandfather, George du Maurier, was a French-born cartoonist and author,  best known for his cartoons in Punch - so the future Dame du Maurier came from a rich history of extremely talented creative minds. Now, she is perhaps most famous of them all. Some of her most popular works include Jamaica Inn (1936) and Rebecca (1938), both of which have been made into hit films - Rebecca even won an Oscar for Best Picture in 1941. Dame Daphne du Maurier at her home in Cornwall, not long before her death in 1989, aged 81 . Du Maurier was born in London and moved into Cannon Hall when she was nine. Some of her early work was published in her mother's magazine Bystander, which helped get her career going. Her first novel, The Loving Spirit, was published in 1931, and she went on to have almost 30 more works of fiction published, including novels The Scapegoat, The House on the Strand, and The King's General, and short story The Birds. She was often called a romantic novelist, though hated the term herself, and many of her stories did not follow the traditional format of a romantic novel in that they did not have happy endings. Her short stories, meanwhile, were often works of terror, and some were said to be ahead of their time. This includes The Doll, a tale she wrote when she was 21 about a mechanical sex doll. Du Maurier also ventured into play writing - she adapted Rebecca for the stage, and  wrote two others, The Years Between and September Tide. She moved into non-fiction as she got older, writing biographies of her own ancestry. She married Major Frederick Browning, who later became a Lieutenant General, in 1932, and had three children with him. She died on April 19, 1989, aged 81, at her home in Cornwall.","Cannon Hall is a six-bedroom, Grade II-listed home near Hampstead Heath in north London .

"Panic erupted aboard an easyjet flight to Nice on Monday when the plane was struck by lightning moments after taking off from Geneva airport in Switzerland. Then after flying to the French Riviera, the plane lurched back into full flight just 200 metres from landing due to a 'blocked runway' and diverted to Milan. Shaken passengers then had to wait another seven hours before another plane was sent from London to return them to Nice. Accident: An easyJet flight was struck by lightning only ten minutes after leaving Geneva Airport (file photo) The route the plane was forced to take - despite reaching its destination and then having to fly off . The drama began when lightning struck flight EZY1377 just ten minutes after taking off from Geneva's Cointrin airport on Monday morning for the 45-minute flight to the south of France. The pilot was told he could not return to the ground and continued to Nice, where bad weather had created a aircraft 'traffic jam' on the ground. The plane then turned suddenly and regained altitude just seconds from landing, and continued another 45 minutes to Milan in northern Italy. Furious travellers said they were then offered just £7 each to buy a 'complimentary' lunch while they waited until 4.40pm for a second plane to take them back to Nice, landing at 5.25pm. The scene over Nice (not from actual incident) - but passengers never actually landed there . However, flyers said the cheapest meal available was £10. Swiss passenger Franca Scuderi told Switzerland's 20 Minutes online news: 'First we were hit by lightening which caused a lot of concern aboard the plane. 'Then we continued to Nice where just 200 metres from the runway we lurched up again and were told we were going to Milan. 'Once there, we were offered nine euros each to buy food and drink, but the cheapest meal in the restaurant was 12 euros. The day was a shambles.' A spokesman from easyJet told Mail Online: 'easyJet can confirm that the flight EZY1377 from Geneva to Nice was diverted to Milan due to thunderstorms over Nice. The aircraft landed routinely in Milan and all passengers disembarked normally. 'Once landed, the captain took the decision to request a replacement aircraft as the original plane was declared unserviceable due to lightning damage. Aircraft are built to withstand lightning strikes. 'A replacement aircraft arrived from Luton in Milan at 16:18 local time. The passengers have been provided with vouchers for lunch at Milan airport. 'The safety of its passengers and crew is the airline’s highest priority and we would like to apologise to any affected passengers for any inconvenience.' Back in July this year travellers on board the flight from Bristol to Barcelona were left terrified when the bolt shook the plane, causing many to burst into tears. The Airbus A319-111 was forced to land at Spain's Reus Airport due to thunderstorms when the lightning strike happened. The flight, from Bristol Airport, was due to arrive at Barcelona International at 10.10am local time. But, just minutes before landing, the plane was struck by the freak storm. A member of the public captured a lightning bolt striking a plane flying into Birmingham . The airport was closed, with many other planes also forced to land at Reus. And in March a flight from Amsterdam to Birmingham was hit by three bolts of lightning. Passengers heard a 'massive bang' - but the plane landed as normal. Incredible photos taken by a member of the public at ground level, capturing the storm, caught a picture of one bolt striking the plane. Passengers spoke of a 'massive bang' as one of the bolts struck the body of the KLM service from Amsterdam, but the blasts had no effect on the landing, which proceeded as normal to touch down.","easyJet flight struck by bolt 10 minutes after taking off from Geneva .

"Settlement: Manwin, owned by Fabian Thylmann (above), alleged that ICM Registry had engaged in price-gouging over its sales of .xxx domain names . The owner of YouPorn faces charges of avoiding paying tax on the £60million his online sex empire is said to earn each year. 'King of Porn' Fabian Thylmann, 34, is being held in a police cell in Cologne, Germany, after he was extradited to his home country from Belgium, where he now lives. Thylmann's online porn video network includes seven of the world's most popular adult sites - including YouPorn, Brazzers, PornHub and MyDirtyHobby - run under the auspices of industry-leading umbrella company Manwin. Over the past decade, the reclusive computer programmer - nicknamed the The Ruler in the Realm of Lust by Germany's Focus magazine - has revolutionised the business of pornography consumption. His websites operate by the same principle as YouTube, allowing visitors - around 16 billion per month - to watch videos for free and generating income through advertising. Sex 'pay sites' appear alongside and offer longer, full-length porn videos. Only a fraction are reported to use these, but this is sufficient to bring in revenues in excess of £60m each year. The rise of YouPorn and similar free sex sites has crippled the traditional porn industry, which offers sex film cinemas, pornographic DVDs, magazines and sex shops. Now, Thylmann has been accused of being a tax evader by Germany's Die Welt newspaper, according to the Independent. Die Welt claims that German porn . actors who performed in videos in their own country were paid by a . subsidiary company in Cyprus. Die . Welt claims this form of remuneration is in flagrant breach of German . tax laws - but Thylmann denies avoiding tax and maintains that he was . merely minimising his tax burden in accordance with widely accepted . practice. X-rated: Thylmann, 34, owns seven of the world's most successful sex sites, including YouPorn, on which users can watch adult videos for free . His lawyers will now have to convince German state prosecutors that there is no case to answer. Thylmann is not what you might expect from the owner of the world's most successful porn sites. He is married with two children and graduated from Brussels' international school after moving from the German city of Aachen to the Belgian city with his parents as a teenager. After working as a computer programmer, he started Manwin, which now controls and largely dictates the terms of a booming global online sex-video market, including the content of individual films . His breakthrough came in the late . 1990s when he was still working as a programmer. Thylmann developed . software called Nats (Next-generation affiliate tracking software), . which linked up the vast number of internet pornography sites for the . first time and enabled visitors to select sex films according to . personal preference. 'Nats . was very easy to use and could do what the others couldn't,' Thylmann . told Germany's FT at a porn industry conference in Las Vegas last year. 'Our . objective is actually rather banal,' he added. 'We want to create as . many opportunities as possible for people to spend money.' Manwin claimed that it was forced to buy expensive .xxx domain names that it already had purchased in .com . In 2006 he secured a licence for the Playboy label, which gave him control of all of its television and online productions. YouPorn followed the same year. Its formula is to offer visitors free and unlimited viewing of videos drawn from a vast and constantly updated library of professional and 'amateur' sex films. The company now employs a staff of 1,000 across the globe and has over 35 subsidiaries in Luxembourg, Canada, Cyprus, Germany, the US, Britain and Ireland. Visitors to Manwin's porn sites have . to go through the motions of an age filter - they press a panel . declaring that they are 18 or over before entering. The variety of pornography available on the sites caters to almost every erotic predilection, fantasy and fetish. Thylmann's sites show videos including German Lesbian Granny Sex Orgy or Mother-in-Law Seduces Shy Cleaner. Thylmann said he was glad to be interviewed because it 'cleared up rumours' and 'dispelled conspiracy theories' concerning his identity, but he disappeared from view until his arrest last Tuesday. Luxembourg-based Manwin, which also runs Playboy.com, filed a lawsuit in California last month to block a new .xxx domain. It claimed that introducing the alternative suffix - which costs more than ten times the domain name fee charged by other registers - was the first step towards making it mandatory, meaning governments could easily censor by blocking access to all .xxx sites. Manwin said it would not allow its content to be used on any sites with the suffix, with Thylmann saying: 'We oppose the .xxx domain and all it stands for. It is my opinion that .xxx domain is an anti-competitive business practice that works a disservice to all companies that do business on the Internet.' The domain names cost £38 per year from ICM Registry, and a one-off fee of £100 and £200.","The German was extradited from Belgium back to his home country .

"A video taken by a news crew 14 years ago has provided a glimpse into the life of quadruple amputee Sean Petrozzino, 30, who is a person of interest in his parent's murder. The footage taken in 2000 shows him as a 16-year-old at a fundraiser in Florida following his fight with bacterial meningitis which claimed both his hands and feet. Surrounded by family, friends and supporters, he tells WKMG Local 6 it is the 'best thing he has had in five months' and is 'overwhelmed' by the turnout. His mother Nancy, 64, who was gunned down along with her husband Michael in their Orange County home on Tuesday, looks teary-eyed as the camera pans to her. She said she had 'no idea' the event would be taking place and was in 'awe' of the 'wonderful people' who attended. Past: Footage taken in 2000 shows Sean Petrozzino as a 16-year-old at a fundraiser in Florida with his mother Nancy (left) following his fight with bacterial meningitis which claimed both his hands and feet .

Emotional: His 63-year-old mother, who was found murdered in her Orange County home on Tuesday, saidshe was in 'awe' of the 'wonderful people' who showed up to the event . Coverage: His inspirational battle with the disease made the headlines 14 years ago, with news crews visiting him in hospital following procedures and at home . Recent photo: Police on Wednesday released this surveillance shot of Petrozzino from when he withdrew cash at an ATM on Tuesday . Petrozzino's inspirational battle with the disease made the headlines when he was a teenager with news crews visiting him in hospital and during events. Recent posts on social media suggests he and his family were happy. Some pictures were taken at Disney World where his father worked. But earlier this year he broke up with his wife Cynthia and moved in with his parents only a week before they were found dead. Soon after making the gruesome discovery, the Orange County Sheriff's Office held a press conference, asking about the whereabouts of the couple's son Sean Petrozzino, 30. They say he may be driving a red Toyota with a license plate number of 112VZY, which neighbors say is his father's car. Sean (right) reportedly moved back home with his parents last week after breaking up with his wife Cynthia (left) Sean Petrozzino has not yet been named as a suspect in the case, but police have named him a person of interest and believe he is armed and dangerous and possibly headed to south Florida. Sean and his great Dane moved back in with his parents last week after separating from his wife. The former couple's home in Georgia is allegedly in foreclosure. Sean is also a quadruple amputee after a teenage bout with bacterial meningitis. In 2000, he underwent 13 surgeries to remove the infection which resulted in the loss of both his legs and he only has part of one hand left.  He is able to walk with the use of prosthetic limbs. 'I've known Sean since he was 16 years old,' mother in law Cathleen Horne told the Sentinel. 'This just seems bizarre. It seems like a bad dream.' 'We met Sean about a week-and-a-half ago,' neighbor Richard Ellwood told My Fox Orlando. 'He was introduced to me by Nancy as their son.' Mr Ellwood went on to describe the couple as nice people who had lived in the neighborhood for several years. 'It's difficult to imagine someone who would have that much rage, whoever did this,' he told WKMG. Before their deaths, Mr Petrozzino worked at Walt Disney World and his wife worked as a teacher at Andover Elementary School. Anyone with information about the son's whereabouts are being asked to call a Crimeline at 800-423-TIPS. Drove off? Police say Sean may be driving this red Toyota with a license plate number of 112VZY. Neighbors say it was Sean's father's car . Victims: Michael (left) and Nancy Petrozzino (right) were found dead in their Orange County, Florida home Tuesday morning . The Orlando Sentinel spoke to Jerry L. Saunders of ABC Prosthetics and Orthotics, who verified that handless people indeed have the ability to fire a weapon. It's also known that Sean Petrozzino is able to manage other finer tasks such as using an ATM. Police verified this late Wednesday when they released surveillance footage of Petrozzino as he used an Orlando cash machine on Tuesday, most likely after his parents were slain. What's more, police are searching for Petrozzino as he's thought to potentially be on his way to South Florida and behind the wheel of his father's red Toyota. Home: Above, the scene of the 'suspicious' deaths in Orange County.

"Veteran disc jockey Paul Gambaccini has told of his ‘12 months of horror and trauma’ after being told he will not face sexual assault charges. The 65-year-old was arrested by officers from Operation Yewtree last October following allegations of sexual abuse. After almost a year the Crown Prosecution Service yesterday confirmed that they will not be taking any further action against the openly gay DJ. The radio DJ denied allegations of historic sexual offences when he was arrested by Operation Yewtree detectives last year . But at the same time the CPS revealed for the first time that the allegations against him involved two underage boys who were around 14 and 15. No mention of alleged paedophilia had been made public before. Gambaccini previously compared his situation to the deep injustice inflicted on impoverished black Americans in Alabama in the 1930s. Last night after learning he could not face charges, he said: ‘Since I was falsely accused last year, the Scottsboro Boys have received posthumous pardons and I have been completely cleared. These are results. Mr Gambaccini (left) presenting Top of the Pops with David Hamilton and Mike Read. Gambaccini will not face further charges over alleged sex offences . The presenter joined the BBC in 1973 as a reporter for a music show. He is pictured with Noel Edmonds as he celebrates his last ever breakfast show with, from left to right, Peter Powell,  paedophile Jimmy Savile, Dave Lee Travis, Noel Edmonds, Simon Bates, David 'Kid' Jenson and Tony Blackburn . ‘There may be members of the Press who will ask me to give interviews or make provocative statements. I will politely decline. ‘To discuss horror in this way is to trivialise it. I will never trivialise the 12 months of trauma to which I have been unjustly subjected. I would like to thank my friends, my lawyers and the people of this country for their support during the past year. ‘Wherever I have gone, I have been stopped in the street by members of the public offering encouragement. I am very grateful. I’ll be back at work soon Thank you.’ The CPS said that it had already informed the complainants there would be no charges, but it would write to them in more detail, and would offer a meeting should they want the failure to charge discussed further. After almost one year, the CPS confirmed they will not be taking any further action against the openly gay DJ . Jimmy Savile (left) was exposed as a serial child abuser in a documentary shown two years ago. Since then, a handful of British celebrities have been faced trial for sexual offences including Max Clifford (right) who was sentenced to eight years in jail . The CPS statement has added fuel to controversy over the wide-ranging Operation Yewtree inquiry, launched in the wake of the late Jimmy Savile being unmasked as a prolific paedophile. Other celebrities including comedians Jim Davidson and Jimmy Tarbuck have had their names dragged through the mud after Yewtree investigated them over decades-old allegations. In July, Stephen Fry blasted Yewtree for gaining convictions for less than half the suspects. Last night Conservative MP Nigel Evans – who resigned as House of Commons deputy speaker before being cleared of sex assault charges in court in April – called for suspects to be guaranteed anonymity unless charged. Rolf Harris (left) was found guilty of 12 counts of indecent assault and Stuart Hall (right) is serving a 30-month sentence . Gambaccini’s solicitor Kate Goold complained that the US-born DJ, who lives in London, had fully cooperated throughout his ordeal but his bail was repeatedly extended with little explanation. She added: ‘We are delighted with the outcome but deeply concerned at the length of time it took to resolve this investigation. Paul made his innocence clear at the outset and questions remain as to why this investigation took so long.’ Last night, the CPS insisted its mention of the age of the boys at the time of the alleged offences, and its public explanation of how it would discuss the lack of charges with them, were all ‘in accordance with guidelines’. Dubbed the Professor of Pop for his encyclopedic knowledge of music, Paul Gambaccini had been a BBC radio DJ for 16 years when he was arrested last year. The 65-year-old, who is openly gay, was born in New York. He gained citizenship to the UK in 2005 despite starting with with the Corporation in 1973 as a reporter on John Steel's Radio 1 show, Rockspeak. He read politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford University as well as studying at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. Despite his success, Mr Gambaccini said he was victim to homophobic treatment within the BBC where his personnel file was reportedly marked with a Christmas tree as he was 'camp as Christmas'. He entered into a civil partnership with model Christopher Sherwood in 2012. Following an ITV documentary in 2012 which exposed the depraved paedophilia of Jimmy Savile, Gambaccini publicly condemned the Jim'll Fix It star, describing him as 'an enigma'. 'He was not all good, he was not all bad, he was an enigma.,' he said on Daybreak. 'You just didn't mess with Jim. 'He was the governor, because after all he had been the first great club DJ, he had been the originator of Top Of The Pops and you just let him have his turf. 'And none of us were interested in going there. 'At social occasions we would all be together, but Jim would not be. He had his own life,' he said on live television. He added he had been waiting for 30 years for the public to be made aware Savile's abuse. 'I’ve been waiting for this to come out for 30 years, but then he did raise millions for charity. 'This comes out when he’s dead because he had an imperial personality in showbiz, and I’m not talking about personal life.' 'Once he was phoned and he said, ""Well, you could run that story, but if you do there goes the funds that come in to Stoke Mandeville Hospital. ""Do you want to be responsible for the drying up of the charity donations?"" And they backed down.'

"The Curry family never knew what killed Thomas in 1925 when the boy was only 17, but they buried his body in Pennsylvania in a cemetery plot with his great grandparents. At least, they believed they did. When anthropologists dug up his coffin Tuesday they found no body, only wooden boards, reports CNN. A team of University of South Florida anthropologists has worked to exhume and identify the bodies of students buried at Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys, where 100 students died between 1900 and 1952. Discovery: Erin Kimmerle has lead a team of researchers and students from University of South Florida and dug up Curry's casket, but found only planks of wood (photos from University of South Florida) As the school's campus was becoming a series of graveyards, Curry died 'under suspicious circumstances while escaping Dozier twenty-nine days after arriving,' according to court documents. The coroner at the time told the family there was no known cause of death, though a ledger noted he was 'killed on RR Bridge Chattahoochee, Fla.' The cemetery where he was buried has a document simply saying he was 'killed by train.' Then in 2008 a death certificate was turned up at Dozier during a state investigation saying that Curry died of a crushed skull but the cause was 'unknown.' That led  anthropologist Erin Kimmerle up to Old Cathedral Cemetery in Philadelphia, where she hoped to answer questions of one more student's death. The casket they found had the same thumbscrews as coffins found on Dozier's campus, but when they opened it, all they found was wood. 'Layers of pieces of wood,' says Kimmerle. 'It was completely filled with wooden planks.' Crosses: The campus at the school became a series of graveyards, as officials buried scores of boys who had died while attending, sending others like Curry home to families . Exhumed: Anthropologists from the University of South Florida, led by Erin Kimmerle, have worked to identify grave shafts and exhume bodies . Plots: The arrangement of graves on the grounds is at times orderly and other times haphazard, and Kimmerle believes more graves are yet to be discovered . Forensics: University students assisted in the digs, which are intended to find human remains and investigate if possible the causes of death . 'Where is he?' said a shocked Pennsylvania state police corporal Thomas McAndrew at the graveside. The Dozier school, which only closed in 2011, has been described as a veritable hell of violence and torture, with with one staff member describing 'boy hunting' to the Tampa Bay Times, where armed guards or convicts from the nearby prison known as 'dog boys' tracked down escapees. Back at Dozier, surviving charges say they were lashed, and some alleged they were sexually abused and raped, though some former administrators have denied the abuse. That is where Curry fled from just before he was found lying by the train tracks with a fatal head wound, and someone worked to ensure the body was not discovered. 'Something was shipped up from Florida, and it was buried, and someone believed it was Thomas Curry,' Kimmerle said later. When the school sent the coffin to his grandmother back in 1925, no one apparently checked the contents inside before a Catholic ceremony was held and he was buried. Kimmerle has contacted relatives of Curry's, and one cousin, 61-year-old Eileen Witmier, who is the granddaughter of Curry's mom's sister, has provided DNA samples researchers hope match to use to identify Curry if his body is found. 'Their interest lies in justice being served,' said Cpl McAndrew.","Thomas Curry, 17, disappeared from the Arthur G.

"From a young age, Sally Cudmore knew she had a sixth sense. But it was only when she began training as a nurse five years ago that the 43-year-old realised how far her supernatural abilities stretched. The mother-of-three, from Blackheath in London, claims she started seeing visions of the future while working on a special care ward - and ended up giving up her nursing career to answer her calling as a medium. When patients were dangerously ill at Lewisham hospital where she worked, she would see red and black surrounding them, indicating their death was imminent. And after just a year, she gave up her career to pursue her gift and bring comfort to grieving relatives. Sally Cudmore, 43, says she was plagued with supernatural visions while working as a nurse in Lewisham . Sally says she began to see the spirit of a young girl when she was eight but she pushed her psychic abilities to the back of her mind. When Sally began training as a nurse, she said she was unable to shut herself off from the spirit world. 'As a trainee nurse I quickly got used to death and I cared for people in their final days,' she said. 'But it was the spirits coming back that I wasn't ready for. Life in a hospital was harder than I could have imagined. 'I trained on a special care ward in Lewisham Hospital where patients were dangerously ill and I started to see events of the future before they happened in my head. 'I knew someone was going to die when I saw red and black surrounding them and it became really upsetting. Sally,  left, as a baby, and right, aged six and dressed as a nurse, gave up her career to become a medium . 'There was one occasion where a patient's family were all remarking how well she looked and how they thought she was getting better. 'I saw the red and black surrounding her and within the hour she was dead. I'm only human and it does get to you - especially when it's children.' But while her visions showed her tragedy, she also found that she could use her powers to bring comfort to grieving relatives and often approaches strangers to pass on messages. 'I would see family members that would be coming for their loved ones. I was able to pass on messages and comfort people in their grief. Sally, pictured at seven, says she knew she was psychic from a young age when she began to see spirits . 'That was when I started to realise that I had a gift and I should use it to help people.' 'I've done it so many times. I've been in Asda or Sainsburys and if I've seen a spirit there I have to give the message. 'Sometimes people are a little bit apprehensive when I approach them but once they hear the accuracy of the message they are usually really grateful. 'I feel like I have a duty to comfort people who are grieving.' After just a year of nursing training, Sally said she 'felt like she had no choice' but to accept her calling. In 2011, she helped the police find an elderly woman with dementia who had been missing for four nights. Sally said she pointed to where the woman was on a map and police officers tracked her down. 'I felt a strong connection with her and I knew that she was alive, but if she wasn't found she would be dead within 24 hours. 'I pointed out where I thought she was on the map and the police found her in an allotment. She had been sleeping on the ground for days with no food and water. 'The doctors said she was three hours from death. If I hadn't connected with her she would have died - I saved her life.' But not all of the reaction is positive and she is now more wary about what she reveals in her readings. She said: 'I saw a triangle when I spoke to one lady. I said to her, 'I can see you, a man and another woman'. 'She told me that she knew her partner was having an affair and when I gave her the other woman's name she confirmed it. 'But later I got a phone call from her partner and he was furious and demanding how I knew the information. 'It came out later that he was having an affair and I'd confirmed his girlfriend's suspicions. 'I'm a lot more wary with that sort of thing now.'","Sally Cudmore, 43, from Blackheath in London, says she was plagued with supernatural visions while working in a hospital .

"It was the pursuit of a healthier lifestyle and a home to raise their young son that led Ray and Marie Butler from London to Scotland at the turn of the millennium. And when they set eyes on Penninghame House – with its sweeping tree-lined approach, castle-like entrance and magnificent halls – they knew immediately they’d found the perfect place for them. The house is set in 100 acres of deer, fox and pheasant-laden woods near the town of Newton Stewart – and has access to an abundance of sea trout and salmon in the River Cree. Captivating gome: Ray and Marie Butler transformed former prison Penninghame House near Newton Stewart in Scotland into a £2.62million pound estate with 13 bedrooms and five cottages . But the tranquil estate also has an intriguing past: one of its former uses was as an open prison. In the early 1950s the Prison Service bought Penninghame. It could hold 85 prisoners and many of them would work on the estate and in its garden centre, which was open to the public and sold local produce. Some of the inmates, who were considered no danger to the public, travelled outside for work as part of their rehabilitation. But by the late 1990s the prison was operating well below capacity, and it closed due to budget cuts in 2000. When the Butlers took it over, they turned much of the estate into a different kind of rehabilitation centre – a retreat offering a variety of courses to improve people’s emotional and physical health. Entrepreneur Ray, who started his own building company when he was just 18, previously ran two restaurants and an alternative health clinic in London. As well as the health retreat and a cooking school, Ray and Marie have turned Penninghame House into a sumptuous family home. Away from the main house, the property also includes cottages and stables and there is planning permission for a pool and leisure complex. Penninghame’s history goes right to the heart of Scotland’s heraldic ancestry. The land ownership can be traced back to the monarchic Stewart dynasty, through the tumultuous period of Mary, Queen of Scots and the reign of Queen Anne, and into the industrial age and beyond. Transformation: As a jail, Penninghame could hold 85 prisoners and many of them would work on the estate and in its garden centre, but  closed due to budget cuts in 2000, when the Butler's bought it . The striking Victorian facade, built in 1869, melds into a property dating from the early 17th Century which was once owned by the Earl of Galloway’s family. The last Earl to own the estate was John Stewart, the 7th Earl of Galloway, who was a Lord of the Bedchamber to King George III. In 1825 it was bought by Conservative MP James Blair, who made his fortune from plantations in the West Indies. At its largest, the Penninghame Estate comprised 37,000 acres, with 40 farms and 30 full-time staff. The house, which is 46 miles from Dumfries and 76 from Glasgow, was used as a hospital during the First World War, after which it returned to use as a private home. In the early 1920s, when it was the home of mill owner Henry Oxley, the estate was recorded as covering 18,000 acres. Ray’s knowledge of the history of the building was added to by a real-life account of the Oxley era, after an elderly former servant asked to visit. OId owner: Portrait of John, 7th Earl of Galloway, the last of his line to own Penninghame House . Ray says: ‘The lady worked as a housemaid and remembered fondly the large parties and dinners during that period, and that Oxley dressed formally each evening and ate in the large dining room.’ The renovation work was a labour of love. Ray says: ‘The oak staircase and all of the imported pitch pine floors were stripped back and oiled. Each of the 88 windows was given individual attention. 'We invested in a new heating system and did major work on the electrics and even added a gym studio.’ The house now has grandiose formal rooms adorned with a spectacular array of fine art, collectable antiques and wood-burning fireplaces. The couple also installed a contemporary kitchen and living area they call Little Sweden, which is inspired by Marie’s roots. And they obviously run deep: the couple are selling because they are moving to Sweden to be closer to her family. ‘The house has served us well,’ says Ray. ‘When we came to Penninghame we were given a very good welcome to the area by the neighbours and people in the community.’ He does not fish, shoot or hunt; however, he says Penninghame is perfect for those with a passion for the great outdoors. Another draw is Penninghame’s proximity to some of the world’s best golf courses, such as Turnberry and Royal Troon. At the front of the property there is a helipad that doubles as a bowling green – and Ray says: ‘We’ve had friends who’ve flown to London by helicopter.’ As well as 13 bedrooms, the house comes with ten bathrooms and five reception rooms. The official valuation of the property – which Scottish law insists upon – has set the minimum price for offers for the house alone at £1.5 million. Five other properties on the estate are for sale, with minimum prices ranging from £220,000 to £350,000. For the whole estate, offers over £2.62 million will be considered.

"Oscar Pistorius's sister left court in tears today after accusing a self-confessed hitman of mouthing abuse at her during her brother's sentencing hearing. Aimee Pistorius claims underworld gun-for-hire Mikey Schultz mouthed 'f*** you' after she expressed discomfort that he was occupying seats normally reserved for the sprinter's family. The dispute came on another dramatic day in court as the Paralympian battled to avoid a jail term for killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. It began with warm applause for Judge Thokozile Masipa's 67th birthday, but descended into scenes of near farce with the Pistorius family demanding immediate police protection. Mr Schultz, who arrived at court shortly before the lunch break, claims a police officer motioned that the only seats available were next to the Pistorius family. Scroll down for video . Oscar Pistorius's sister, Aimee (left), cries alongside aunt Lois during testimony at her brother's sentencing hearing. In a separate incident, she left court in tears after accusing a hitman of mouthing abuse at her . Hitman: Mikey Schultz, the self-confessed killer of South African mine magnate Brett Kebble, claims he and a friend were told by the Pistorius family to move from their seating area 'like we were dogs' But within ten minutes taking his seat, tattooed Mr Schultz had stormed out of court, claiming the athlete's family had told him and his friend to move 'like we were dogs'. Complaining loudly to reporters, he said: 'Who do they [the Pistorius family] think they are? Do they think they own the front row?' Once Judge Masipa had adjourned for an early lunch, the clearly distressed and tearful Miss Pistorius reported the incident to her brother Carl, prompting him to ask for immediate police protection for the family and for Mr Schultz to be banned from court. Outside the Pretoria high court, Mr Schultz joined two friends - both known rivals of the double amputee - where he gave an impromptu television interview to deny Miss Pistorius's story. He said: 'Clearly the Pistorius family are a bunch of liars, just like Oscar' adding with a heavy hint of sarcasm: 'They are the victims, always the victims.' He denied mouthing any abuse. Mr Schultz, whose immunity from prosecution for his role in the 2005 contract killing of mining magnate Brett Kebble was ironically negotiated by Gerrie Nel, is not known to have any direct 'bad blood' with 27-year-old Pistorius, unlike the two friends who flanked him outside court. Steely glare: Oscar Pistorius walks past former South African footballer Mark Batchelor, who claimed the athlete once threatened to break his legs after believing he had slept with his then girlfriend Samantha Taylor . Former South African footballer Mark Batchelor (in white shirt) accompanied Mr Schultz outside court . Pistorius is said to have threatened to 'break the legs' of Mark Batchelor, a retired footballer, whom he suspected his girlfriend Samantha Taylor of cheating on him with, and Jared Mortimer, who sent the athlete flying to the floor after they were involved in a scuffle at a nightclub in July. As the burly trio of Mr Schultz, Mr Mortimer and Mr Batchelor huddled together rather menacingly at the entrance to the court house during the lunch adjournment, Pistorius narrowly missed a potentially excruciating encounter. As the Paralympic gold medallist strode purposefully up the road in search of lunch, a gaggle of police officers had to run to catch up with him to offer rather tardy protection. Today was not the first appearance that Mr Schultz has put in court. On Tuesday, he sat with Mr Mortimer, Mr Batchelor and Miss Taylor on benches reserved for the Steenkamp family and their friends. Their glowering presence clearly unsettled Pistorius in the dock, leading his uncle Arnold, the patriarch of the sprinter's family, to have his nephew escorted home from court by police out of 'fear for Oscar's safety.'","Aimee Pistorius claims self-confessed killer Mikey Schultz mouth 'f*** you'

"For the second straight year, youth and adult membership in the Girl Scouts has dropped sharply, intensifying pressure on the 102-year-old youth organization to find ways of reversing the trend. According to figures provided to The Associated Press, the total of youth members and adult volunteers dropped by 6per cent over the past year — from 2,994,844 to 2,813,997. Over two years, total membership is down 11.6per cent, and it has fallen 27per cent from a peak of more than 3.8million in 2003. While the Girl Scouts of the USA have had an array of recent internal difficulties — including rifts over programming and serious fiscal problems — CEO Anna Maria Chavez attributed the membership drop primarily to broader societal factors that have affected many youth-serving organizations. Smart cookies: For the second straight year, youth and adult membership in the Girl Scouts has dropped . 'Parents and families are less financially stable, frequently working two jobs or more, leaving little time to volunteer or take their children to extracurricular activities,' she said. In hopes of stemming the decline, the Girl Scouts are revamping their online platforms with new toolkits. One is aimed at streamlining the process of joining the Girl Scouts; another seeks to help volunteer troop leaders plan an entire year of meetings and activities with a single online visit. 'These tools will dramatically decrease the amount of time a volunteer has to spend preparing so that they can spend it serving the girls,' Chavez said. A crucial challenge, she said, is supporting the current ranks of volunteers and recruiting more adults to join them. A breakdown of the 2014 figures shows 809,413 adult leaders and 2,004,584 youth members. In 2003, there were about 2.9million youth members and more than 900,000 adults. In some regions, a shortage of volunteers is forcing Girl Scout councils to turn away girls who want to join. Chavez said there are about 30,000 girls on waiting lists nationwide. 'The need for what Girl Scouts has to offer is not decreasing — more than ever girls need our time and our commitment,' she said. 'Our challenge is to meet them where they are with enough caring adults to serve them.' Last year, the Girl Scouts enlisted First Lady Michelle Obama to make a video pitch for more adult volunteers. This year, there's a national recruitment campaign on Facebook. Campaign: Last year, the Girl Scouts enlisted First Lady Michelle Obama (pictured planting seedlings at the White House with Girl Scouts in 2012) to make a video pitch for more adult volunteers . Just two years ago, the Girl Scouts celebrated their centennial with a host of upbeat activities, but it's been a rough stretch since then. There was disgruntlement in some regional councils related to a deficit-strapped pension plan, as well as revenue shortfalls that prompted the national headquarters to trim about one-fourth of its staff through buyouts and layoffs. Many alumnae — including some who were active as volunteers — complained publicly about the closure of some Girl Scout camps and what they perceived as a misguided shift away from camping and other traditional outdoor activities. Chavez defended the changes, which included new programs seeking to boost girls' competency with money matters and encouraging them to pursue careers in science and technology. The Girl Scouts also have defended their decision to enter a business partnership with Mattel, the manufacturer of Barbie dolls. There's now a Barbie patch that girls can wear on their uniforms and a Barbie Girl Scout doll. Two consumer advocacy groups — the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood and the Center for a New American Dream — have urged an end to the partnership, saying Barbie is a flawed role model for little girls. If there's a broad theme to the Girl Scouts' current outreach efforts, it's to depict its programs as invaluable in helping girls grow up to be leaders, particularly girls disadvantaged by poverty and racial or ethnic disparities. The Girl Scouts Research Institute recently compiled a comprehensive study, 'The State of Girls,' that assesses how the organization can help address social, economic, and health issues affecting the 26 million girls ages 5 to 17 in the U.S. That mission — as well as the membership problems and the new outreach strategies — will be discussed next week at the organization's national convention in Salt Lake City. Some other youth organizations also have been losing members, for reasons including competition from youth sports leagues and a perception by some families that they are old-fashioned. The Boy Scouts of America lost 6 percent of its membership last year; its youth membership has dropped from 3.3 million to about 2.5 million since 2002. The Boy Scouts alienated some conservatives last year by deciding to accept openly gay boys for the first time, while angering gay-rights supporters by maintaining a ban on gays serving as adult leaders . By contrast, the Girl Scouts have long had inclusive membership policies, although there have been some defections by families who felt the organization had become too liberal. American Heritage Girls, formed in 1995 as a Christian-oriented alternative, now claims more than 35,000 members.","Over two years, total membership is down 11.6per cent, and it has fallen 27per cent from a peak of more than 3.8 million in 2003 .

"The Weather Channel has released an official statement arguing that man-made global warming is real, just days its co-founder said it does not exist. The group claims said the planet is 'indeed warming,' with temperatures increasing 1 to 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit (0.6°C to 0.9°C) in the last 100 years. The Atlanta-based channel also states humans are helping make the planet warmer as a result of burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. Scroll down for video . The Weather Channel has released an official statement arguing that global warming is real, just days its co-founder John Coleman (pictured) said it does not exist. In a letter attacking the UN, the 80-year-old from San Diego, said that what 'little evidence' there is for global warming points to natural cycles in temperature . 'Potential outcomes range from moderate and manageable to extreme and catastrophic,' it said in its statement. 'Impacts can already be seen, especially in the Arctic, with melting glaciers, thawing permafrost, and rapid retreat and thinning of sea ice, all of which are affecting human populations as well as animals and vegetation. 'There and elsewhere, rising sea level is increasing coastal vulnerability.' 'The bottom line is that with the rate of greenhouse gas emissions increasing, a significant warming trend is expected to also continue,' it added. John Coleman (left), is pictured here in 1981 as ABC-TV's Good Morning America' meteorologist. He claims 'rfforts to prove the theory that carbon dioxide is a significant greenhouse gas and pollutant causing significant warming or weather effects have failed. There has been no warming over 18 years' The statement contradicts the views of John Coleman, co-founder of the Weather Channel, who last week said the belief humans are causing climate change is not backed up by science. In an open letter attacking the UN, the 80-year-old from San Diego, said that what 'little evidence' there is for global warming points to  natural cycles in temperature. 'There is no climate crisis,' he wrote. 'The ocean is not rising significantly. The polar ice is increasing, not melting away. Polar bears are increasing in number. 'Heat waves have actually diminished, not increased. There is not an uptick in the number or strength of storms. The statement contradicts the views of John Coleman, co-founder of the Weather Channel, who last week said the belief humans are causing climate change is not backed up by science . Dr Jason Box tweeted this provocative statement after a Swedish study found methane leaking beneath the Arctic . The planet is 'f**cked' after scientists found huge plumes of deadly methane escaping from the seafloor. This is according to Dr Jason Box who claims that methane will be the main driver of climate change if it escapes into the atmosphere. He said: 'If even a small fraction of Arctic sea floor carbon is released to the atmosphere, we're f'd' The scientist, based at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, tweeted the provocative statement after a Swedish study found methane leaking beneath the Arctic. Some of this methane – which is over 20 times more potent than CO2 at trapping heat - is now making it to the ocean's surface. The leaking gas from the seafloor may have its origins in collapsing clusters of methane trapped in frozen water due to high pressure and low temperature. Scientists at Stockholm University called the discovery 'somewhat of a surprise,' which, according to Dr Box, is an understatement. 'We're on a trajectory to an unmanageable heating scenario, and we need to get off it,' Dr Box told Brian Merchant at Motherboard . 'We're f**ked at a certain point, right? It just becomes unmanageable. The climate dragon is being poked, and eventually the dragon becomes pissed off enough to trash the place.' 'I have studied this topic seriously for years. It has become a political and environment agenda item, but the science is not valid.' Though the Weather Channel did not mention Mr Coleman, the statement was published just days after his views were widely reported. According to The Express, Mr Coleman based his research on the findings of the NIPCC, a non-governmental international body of scientists. Their role is to offer an second opinion of the evidence reviewed by the UN's International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC has warned that no one will be untouched by climate change with storm surges, flooding and heatwaves among the key risks. The report said that violent conflicts, food shortages and serious infrastructure damage were also predicted to become more widespread over the coming years . 'There is no significant man-made global warming at this time, there has been none in the past and there is no reason to fear any in the future,' added Mr Coleman. 'Efforts to prove the theory that carbon dioxide is a significant greenhouse gas and pollutant causing significant warming or weather effects have failed.' The IPCC has warned that no one will be untouched by climate change with storm surges, flooding and heatwaves among the key risks. The report said that violent conflicts, food shortages and serious infrastructure damage were also predicted to become more widespread over the coming years. It also claimed that the world is in 'an era of man-made climate change' and has already seen impacts of global warming on every continent and across the oceans. It highlighted that in recent decades, Earth has seen changes in water resources as a result of melting glaciers and differences in rainfall, and reductions in wheat and maize yields. In the wake of the report's publication there were renewed calls from scientists and campaigners for action to cut greenhouse gases and to help vulnerable people adapt to already-unavoidable impacts of climate change. In order to minimise the risk of human interference in the climate system, the international community has agreed limit temperature rise to 2°C above pre-industrial levels. Projected temperature change from 2081-2100. For the first time, the report connects hotter global temperatures to hotter global tempers. Top scientists are saying that climate change will complicate and worsen existing global security problems, such as civil wars, strife between nations and refugees . 'We live in an era of man-made climate change,' said Vicente Barros, co-chair of the IPCC study on climate change impacts, vulnerabilities and adaptation, from the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina. At the time of the report, one of its contributors has accused the IPCC of being too 'alarmist' – and demanded his name be withdrawn. Professor Richard Tol, an economist at the University of Sussex, said the drafts had been changed to make the findings more 'apocalyptic'. He said colleagues 'drifted too far to the alarmist side' and were likening climate change to the 'Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse'.

Denesevich wore a wire as part of the plot, which lead to the arrest of six people who had stolen more than 1,200 identities. At his sentencing hearing on Friday, the court heard how Denesevrich fled to Canada in 2012 after police approached him over his crimes. However he returned to South Florida following the birth of his son. 'I came back here for my son,' Denesevich told the judge, according to WPTV. 'I'm extremely sorry to my victims.' FBI agents also appeared in court to corroborate Denesevich's work for them. Before: Derek Denesevich's attorney declined to comment on his client's decision to get the luxury car tattoo, however the Florida father is now having all his facial ink removed .

As a result he received a sentence of one year and three months, following by three years of supervised release. However he must pay back the $57,328 he stole as part of his tax fraud scheme. Part of the money will be paid by Porscha Kyles, the Clerk of Courts employee who helped him with the scam. She is serving three years for her crimes. Although he is trying to erase his facial tattoos, Denesevich is said to have a tattoo on his back featuring his own face, complete with the Bentley logo on his forehead.","Derek Denesevich, 26, of Lauderhill, Florida, was facing four and a half years prison on charges of aggravated identity theft in 2011 and 2012 .

"An American who is back home after being detained for nearly six months in North Korea said Friday that he left a Bible in a nightclub hoping it would get into the hands of what he called the country's underground Christian church. Jeffrey Fowle said he traveled to the country as a tourist but saw the opportunity as a way to follow the Christian mission 'to carry the Gospel to all corners of the oath.' 'I knew it was a risk, that I was taking a gamble, but I felt compelled to do that to aid the underground church in some small way,' Fowle said in an interview in his lawyer's office. Released: Jeffrey Fowle talks about being detained in North Korea for nearly six months, in Lebanon, Ohio. He said by leaving a bible in a night club he hoped to reach the hermit kingdom's Christian underground . Emotional reunion: One of his children ran into his arms when he touched town on US soil last week . 'I felt once I left the Bible somewhere that God would take it the rest of the way into the hands of some kind of Christian organization, and I'd be able to waltz out of country fat, dumb and happy, no problem,' he said. 'But God had other plans.' Fowle, 56, arrived in North Korea on April 29. The married father of three returned home last week after negotiations involving retired diplomat and former Ohio Congressman Tony Hall. Fowle, who conducted several interviews Friday about his detention, was relaxed and comfortable during a 45-minute interview. He said he went to North Korea to experience the country and that spreading the Gospel was a secondary motivation. He'd previously traveled to Bosnia and Mongolia, he said, saying he liked 'out-of-the-way places.' He was aware of warnings about travel to North Korea but went anyway, knowing that American tourists had gone and returned over the past decade. Tourist: The 56-year-old (pictured with his family) said he said he went to North Korea to experience the country and that spreading the Gospel was a secondary motivation . Embrace: His children did not know that there father was returning after being detained for six months . Fowle, an equipment operator in the city of Moraine street department, said he paid about $3,900 for the tour, plus about $700 for a flight to Beijing. He said criticisms that going on such a tour would help the North Korean government continue its oppressive ways was a 'legitimate question,' but he doubted his money went far. 'My fees wouldn't have bought a tank, that's for sure,' he said. Fowle said he left the Bible — with his name in it — in a bathroom under a trash bin at a nightclub in the northern port city of Chongjin and hoped a Christian would find it. He chose that city and the nightclub in the belief there would be less security. He bought the English-Korean Bible before his trip. Instead, his tour guide asked the next day if anyone had left a Bible there and he owned up to it. He was detained a few days later while going through customs before departure. Fowle was taken to a hotel for about three weeks and questioned, then moved to another facility. He wrote a confession and answered questions about his motivations. He said authorities couldn't believe he had acted on his own, but he made clear it was his own decision. He was treated well and was comfortable but was in his locked quarters 23½ hours a day, he said. Actions: Fowle said he left the Bible — with his name in it — in a bathroom under a trash bin at a nightclub in the northern port city of Chongjin and hoped a Christian would find it. He owned up to his tour guide the next day . He was allowed to speak in September to Western news organizations, including The Associated Press, in five-minute interviews. He said he was given 'talking points' for those interviews, meant to convey his 'desperate situation.' The intention, in his mind, was 'to have the U.S. government or some other entity step in to help resolve that situation.' He said he never considered going off script, although he did reject requests that he try to be more emotional and more demanding of the U.S. government. Fowle said he felt that would make his situation worse at home. Fowle said his release came as a surprise — he thought he was about to be taken to prison — and he was told by an American who helped him escort him home that the North Korean government was responsible for his return. Fowle said he knew there was a risk but believed it was worth taking to get the Bible into the hands of North Korean Christians. In hindsight, he said, he wouldn't do it again. Movement: Fowle was taken to a hotel for about three weeks and questioned, then moved to another facility. He wrote a confession and answered questions about his motivations . His family suffered in his absence, especially after the city of Moraine was forced to terminate him when his leave was exhausted. His wife, Tatyana, works only part time. But some good has come of the incident, he said, including a deeper appreciation for his family. He apologized to his wife in a letter from North Korea and has pledged to be a better, more attentive husband and father. 'You don't know what you've got until it's taken away from you forcibly,' he said. 'You don't appreciate what you've got.' Fowle said he will be glad to return to his job with the city of Moraine, a Dayton suburb. The city agreed to give him his street department job back but said risky travel in the future would result in his firing. Fowle said he agrees with the requirement and has no plans for missionary work in 'closed countries' in the future. U.S. officials are trying to win the release of two other Americans who are being held in North Korea, Matthew Miller and Kenneth Bae. Fowle said he had had no contact with Miller or Bae.

"David Cameron is under intense pressure to crush Ukip in next month’s Rochester by-election after senior figures in his own party blamed him for the Eurosceptic party’s surge. After losing the previously safe Tory seat of Clacton to Ukip, the battle in the seat of Rochester and Strood, Kent, has become a critical test of the Prime Minister’s authority, warned MPs. The Tories had been braced for defeat in Clacton where the Ukip candidate was Tory defector Douglas Carswell – a popular MP in the constituency. Nonetheless, there was alarm at the scale of his triumph. Scroll down for video . David Cameron has pledged to throw 'everything he can' at Rochester as the Conservatives face potential upset in another 20 key marginal seats where a Ukip swing could had victory to Labour . Mr Carswell recorded an overwhelming victory over the Conservative candidate with 59.6 per cent of the vote and an increased majority of 12,404. The Tories took 8,709 votes, or 24 per cent. Labour took 3,957 – some 11 per cent, meaning its share of the vote more than halved. Sources at Tory HQ said they were now planning to recruit Labour and Lib Dem voters – who strongly dislike Nigel Farage – to vote Tory in a ‘keep Ukip out’ campaign in Rochester, where former Conservative MP Mark Reckless has also defected to Ukip. The Prime Minister is promising to ‘throw everything he can’ at the contest, which is expected to be much closer than in Clacton. Conservative party chairman Grant Shapps said the by-election results at Clacton and Heywood had been ‘an alarm clock message, a stark warning’. But he warned Ukip voters that the person with a ‘big smile on his face’ would be Ed Miliband, who would ultimately be handed victory if the rise of Ukip continued to split the Tory vote. After the result, former Tory deputy chairman and pollster Lord Ashcroft, a regular critic of Mr Cameron said scathingly: ‘The Conservative Party leadership must take a large part of the credit for the rise of Ukip.’ Mark Reckless holds up a newspaper announcing that Douglas Carswell has been elected as the first Ukip MP as he seeks to follow suit in another by-election next week . And veteran right-winger Sir Edward Leigh also blamed his party’s leaders for the rise of Ukip, saying the result in Clacton was a ‘warning shot’ across the party’s bow. ‘A whole host of errors conceived or approved of by Tory bigwigs has fostered the steady loss of votes to the Faragists,’ he said. Sir Edward said ‘coalition with the Liberals, increased taxes on the middle classes, cuts to the armed forces, failed and wasteful green policies, failing to deliver the promised referendum on Lisbon, the massive increase in international aid spending, and controversial and revolutionary social policies such as same-sex civil marriage’ had all contributed to the result. He suggested that collapsing the Coalition would show disillusioned potential Tory voters that Mr Cameron was serious about addressing their concerns. ‘In order to reconnect with our supporters, we need to break up the Coalition,’ he said. One senior source on the powerful 1922 Committee of backbench Conservatives said the Rochester by-election had become ‘more important’ as a result of Thursday night’s results. But he said Mr Cameron had ‘belatedly come up with the right prescription’ when he promised big tax cuts and reform of EU free movement in his party conference speech earlier this month. However, another senior backbencher warned Mr Cameron could face ‘a real crisis’ if Ukip wins in Rochester. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said voters in Clacton could see the economy was improving but still felt a ‘lack of security’ and were ‘frustrated about what they perceived as an influx of immigrants, mostly from Europe’. ‘They were adamant that they wanted this controlled, in or out of the EU, and they wanted to have their say on whether we left the EU,’ he wrote on the ConservativeHome website. ‘They were also disenchanted with what they perceive as Westminster insincerity. Mr Reckless defected to Ukip last month on the second day of their conference, and has been heavily criticised as a traitor by some Tories . Nigel Farage was out celebrating until 4.45am with his new Ukip MP after Douglas Carswell stormed to victory in Clacton with a majority of 12,404 votes . ‘Many were clear that they understood that the by-election was an opportunity to send a signal to the Government. Yet, despite all this they couldn’t have been clearer that they were also ready to be persuaded to vote Conservative at the General Election, that they understood the difference in the two votes.’ Mr Duncan Smith added that he was ‘struck by the fact’ that many voters ‘still don’t realise that they will decide Britain’s future only if the Conservatives are in power after the next election – that it is only David Cameron who is committed to deliver that referendum they want’. Eurosceptic Conservative MP Mark Pritchard admitted he had been ‘attracted’ by Ukip. But he insisted he had been persuaded to stay by Mr Cameron’s promise last year of a referendum on Britain’s EU membership. ‘I came to the conclusion that if I really want to renegotiate the United Kingdom’s relationship with Europe, the only party that can deliver that is the Conservative party,’ the Wrekin MP said. Mr Pritchard said he did not believe any more Conservative MPs would defect to Ukip before the next election. Greg Hands, the Government’s deputy chief whip, agreed, saying: ‘Part of my job is to know the Conservative Party and I am confident that there won’t be.’ Former Conservative MP Jerry Hayes, a barrister, said Ukip had ‘officially replaced the Lib Dems as the spittoon for the aggrieved, the nutters, the no-hopers and thoroughly p***** off’. One poll has put Mr Reckless, who defected from the Conservatives to Ukip last month, on course for victory in Rochester and Strood. However, the Tories have yet to select a candidate and strategists are confident they can defeat the MP – who lacks the personal appeal of Mr Carswell – by winning back supporters flirting with Ukip. They are also drawing up plans to woo Labour and Lib Dem voters who dislike Ukip – a tactic credited with delivering victory in a by-election in Newark earlier this year. Labour may have been given a scare in Heywood and Middleton, but the truth is Ukip still remains a far bigger risk to the Tories . The outcome of the General Election in May is now almost impossible to predict. For the Tories, the by-election results were abysmal. In Heywood and Middleton, their vote collapsed in a seat where they performed respectably in 2010. In Clacton, they suffered a swing against them to Ukip of 44 per cent. For the Liberal Democrats, the outcomes just confirmed their catastrophic decline since their U-turn on tuition fees. At Clacton, they even lost their deposit. Labour, too, was shaken. Heywood and Middleton is the sort of safe, northern constituency they should win easily. But they triumphed by just 617 votes after a swing of 18 per cent to Ukip. That demonstrates the potential threat that Ukip represents in Labour’s heartlands. If the voting patterns seen on Thursday were to be replicated in a General Election – which, of course, they won’t be – the outcome would be astonishing. A similar swing to the one in Heywood to Ukip would see Farage lead his party to an overall majority with 331 seats. Labour would lose 32 seats of its current 257, the Lib Dems 52 out of the 57 they won in 2010, and the Tories would lose 246 MPs, leaving them with just 57. If Ukip’s success at Clacton were to be repeated next year on a national scale, then Britain would virtually be a one-party state. But by-elections are totally different from General Elections. Ukip cannot fight on a national scale as intensively as they did in Clacton, while their efforts will also be undermined by the first-past-the-post system. And here is the silver lining for Labour. Even with the powerful campaign mounted by Ukip, Labour were still able to hang on in Heywood and Middleton. Indeed, their share of the vote actually went up by 1 per cent. The lesson is that Labour’s safe seats remain resilient. The truth is that Ukip remains a bigger danger to the Tories. Polling shows that 14 per cent of people who voted Tory in the 2010 General Election plan to vote Ukip next May, whereas the figure for Labour is 6 per cent. That gives Ed Miliband a key advantage in many of the crucial marginal constituencies. Based on the latest polls, it is possible Labour could take some 20 of these from the Conservatives – seats that would stay Tory if it was not for Ukip stealing their votes. In addition, there are five marginal Lib Dem seats which are key Tory targets that could remain out of David Cameron’s hands because of the greater number of Tory switchers to Ukip. That is why Miliband may still win an overall majority. The latest average of the polls puts Labour on course for a majority of 18 in the Commons. If the Tories lose the Rochester and Strood by-election, they will be in real trouble.","David Cameron says he is prepared to throw 'everything we can' at election .

"He may be famous for fighting crime, but Mr Incredible turned Bad Guy this week when he was filmed attacking Batgirl in Los Angeles. The two superhero impersonators came to blows in front of hundreds of tourists outside TCL Chinese Theater on Hollywood Boulevard on Tuesday. The scene was made all the more bizarre when other costumed characters in the vicinity including Star Wars' Chewbacca and Where's Wally (also known as Waldo) stepped in to break up the scuffle. Superhero scuffle: Mr Incredible and Batgirl impersonators came to blows on Hollywood Boulevard on Tuesday . Even Nightmare on Elm Street's villainous Freddy Krueger turned hero as he attempted to protect Batgirl. The incident was caught on camera by Filmon.com crew, who were filming nearby when the fight kicked off. It is currently unknown what sparked the brawl, and the clip begins with the two characters already in a vicious tangle. As the camera approaches, it follows Chewbacca as he marches over to where Mr Incredible and Batgirl are wrestling each other. Fighting crime: Where's Wally (or Waldo), Freddy Kruger and Chewbacca intervened in the fight . The actor dressed as Pixar's Mr Incredible is shown attempting to pin Batgirl up against the wall as she fights back, with Chewbacca attempting to pull him off of her. A woman in a Where's Wally costume also approaches to intervene, followed by Krueger. The video cuts to Mr Incredible attacking Batgirl again, shoving Where's Wally into the street and dangerously close to traffic when she tries to stop him.

"Notorious New York Yankees third-baseman Alex Rodriguez allegedly paid his cousin a total of $900,000 to stop him from exposing his suspected use of performance enhancing drugs, it was revealed today. The allegations concerning Rodriguez’s financial dealings with his relative, Yuri Sucart, were outlined in documents filed last week in US District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The court filings, obtained by the New York Daily News, state that in June 2013, the Yankees slugger paid just short of a million dollars to Sucart in so-called hush money. Scroll down for video . 'Hush money': Court filings state Alex Rodriguez paid his cousin Yuri Sucart one payment of $700,000 and three more totaling $200,000 as part of settlement in 2013 . Sucart is facing federal charges in connection to a doping scandal revolving around the Florida rejuvenation clinic Biogenesis of America, which rocked Major League Baseball last year. More than a dozen prominent baseball players ended up suspended for their alleged ties to the notorious clinic that was peddling illegal human growth hormones. Rodriguez was hit with a 211-game suspension in August, but was allowed to play 49 games in the 2013 season pending his appeal. That same month, Biogenesis founder Anthony Bosch agreed to enter a guilty plea to one count of conspiracy to distribute testosterone, and he is currently awaiting sentencing. Infamous: The New York Yankees third-baseman was among more than a dozen players who were suspended last year over use of performance enhancing drugs . According to court filings, Alex Rodriguez signed off in June 2013 on a confidential settlement with his cousin, whom he had previously named as his supplier of PEDs, paying him $700,000 in one payment, followed by three more installments totaling $200,000. Six months earlier, Sucart's former attorney, Jeffrey Sonn, allegedly wrote a letter to Rodriguez demanding $5million and a 'life estate' for his client and his wife. Sports Illustrated magazine reported in 2009 that Rodriguez had tested positive for anabolic steroid use in the 2003 season. He later admitted using the drugs but dragged the name of his cousin Mr Sucart into the scandal claiming that he had encouraged him to take banned drugs and helped administer them. Ready for comeback: The 39-year-old slugger is said to be laying the groundwork for his comeback . Sucart was subsequently banned by the Yankees from team flights, facilities and trips. Rodriguez has not publicly commented on these latest revelations. The 39-year-old slugger, who has three more years left on his contract with the Yankees, is said to be laying the groundwork for his comeback. 'At some point in the future, Alex will have something to say,’ Ron Berkowitz, Rodriguez’s representative, told ESPN New York. ‘Today is not the time. When it is time, everyone will hear from Alex. Right now, he is working out and ready to return for 2015.’","Court filings state Rodriguez paid Yuri Sucart one payment of $700,000 and three more totaling $200,000 as part of settlement in 2013 .

"Dozens of tourists have been struck down with the same illness while heading to a popular holiday destination. While on their way to the Blue Mountains in NSW many of 25 Japanese visitors on the same tour bus started showing symptoms of food poisoning. Most of the people on board were suffering from diarrhoea and vomiting, The Sydney Morning Herald reported. Earlier that morning they had all been on a stopover in Brisbane where they shared a meal. Dozens of Japanese tourists on a tour bus were struck down with a violent stomach illness on Tuesday . Paramedics were called to a street in Chipping Norton where they assessed patients . Some tourists had to be transported to hospital via ambulance . Just after 1pm on Monday paramedics were called to Governor Macquarie Drive in Chipping Norton when the tourists were apparently en route to Katoomba in the Blue Mountains. Pictures show the medics geared up assessing the sick holidaymakers, checking blood pressure and other symptoms. Wearing masks and other protective gear they checked people one by one by the side of the road before transporting some of them in ambulances. Others who weren't as sick piled out of the bus and sat by the side of the road wearing face masks . A spokeswoman for south-west Sydney Local Health District said the patients were exhibiting signs of food poisoning . Four people were admitted to Liverpool Hospital and are now in a stable condition . Initially the first sick tourist was quarantined in the bathroom of Murray coach the group were travelling in, a witness told the website, before more of the passengers began to fall ill. Michael Akkari said the patients were transported to hospital in the coach, which was used as a 'quarantine capsule'. 'The less sick ones sat on the grass strip beside the bus. They were obviously concerned, but there were a few laughs being had,' he said. A south-west Sydney Local Health District spokeswoman confirmed to Daily Mail Australia they were taken to Liverpool Hospital, where four people were admitted. She said that all were in a stable condition, and had exhibited the same symptoms consistent with food poisoning. Another spokesman made it clear to The Sydney Morning Herald 'this is definitely not a case of Ebola'.","The tourists fell ill on the way to the Blue Mountains in NSW .

"To share or not to share? That is the question. Parents fear they could lose friends on social media and become a 'baby bore' by bombarding Facebook's news feed with photos of their children. The rise of social media has seen users share personal photos on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, but a study taken by Tinybeans, an Australian-born social network app for parents, reveals 50 per cent of parents worry 'over-sharenting' will annoy friends. Despite three quarters of Australian parents worrying about the safety of sharing baby pictures on social media, one in 10 parents admit their concern is losing friends. Tinybeans user Lee Bradford joined the social network site after realising all her baby pictures were annoying Facebook friends . Despite three quarters of Australian parents worrying about the safety of sharing baby pictures on social media, one in 10 parents admit their concern is losing friends . This follows last month's warning to mothers who post baby pictures publicly, after Instagram users were caught stealing newborn and toddler photos, re-posting them to new accounts, and then inviting followers to create elaborate story-lines with the children. The practice is called 'baby role-playing,' and a quick search for the hashtag '#babyrp' has revealed hundreds of these accounts exist, with new ones popping up daily. The scenarios - which take place in Instagram comment sections - usually involve one user acting as the parent or caregiver and another pretending to be the child, who's been given a new name. Though most of the back and forth is relatively innocent (swaddling or feeding the baby, for example), occasionally the scenarios turn extremely sexual and violent. Safety prompted three Australians to build a secure and private social media network for parents who love taking pictures of their kids and sharing them online. Sarah-Jane Kurtini, co-founder of Tinybeans, said the study found 50 per cent of parents were sharing up to five photos  everyday. 'As most new parents know, you want to share your precious moments and not have to worry about security and privacy issues,' Ms Kurtini said. 'As Tinybeans is a private social network you can confidently share your precious moments without risking alienating friends who may not like having their feeds clogged with your baby pictures.' Founders of Tinybeans Sarah-Jane Kurtini, Stephen O'Young and Eddie Geller . Lee Bradford said she  was taking up to 100 to 150 photos of her daughter, Isla (pictured), each day . The organisation focuses on the well-being of a child and allows parents to create a journal-like account. 'Our users own their content and we provide value beyond printing services and sharing photos through our focus on helping families raise their children and support their child's development.' First-time mother Lee Bradford  knows the anxiety of 'over-sharenting' all too well. She told Daily Mail Australia she was taking up to 100 to 150 photos of her daughter, Isla, each day. 'I copped quite a bit of slack because I posted one too many photos - waking up photos, sleeping photos, side photos,' she said. 'At the start everyone was really excited but eventually my friends were commenting on the photos saying ""Oh, another photo of Isla - hasn't she changed since the last 48 photos you've put up."""" Ms Bradford, who lives in Bondi Beach, Sydney, explained her reasons for sharing pictures of her daughter was to let her family, who are not Sydney residents, see Isla grow up. 'I realised it was becoming an issue. I actually had people unfollow me and unfriend me,' she said. Losing Facebook friends was not Ms Bradford's only fear, she held concerns for her daughters safety and made sure she would never post photos of her naked, at the beach or potty training. Instagram users were caught stealing newborn and toddler photos, re-posting them to new accounts, and then inviting followers to create elaborate story-lines with the children . Tinybeans offered piece of mind to Ms Bradford and meant annoying friends on Facebook would no longer be a problem. 'When you first become a parent it is the proudest moment of your life and you feel like the whole world feels the same but they actually don’t,' Ms Bradford laughs. 'Tinybeans is a safe community where I can post anything I want and I know that people want to see it. 'I am on another website called Bondi Babies which has 4000 followers and people are constantly asking for a media outlet that lets them post photos of their children that allows their family and friends access. 'I am fast to jump on and tell them all about Tinybeans.' But this is not something that only Ms Bradford enjoys, she said even Isla has an input with her Tinybeans page. 'Most of the time she is quite particular about what photos are being taken of her and she says ""Mummy have we 'beans' it?"", Ms Bradford said. 'She (Isla) has a very solid understanding of who gets to see it.' Tinybeans has been established since 2012 and now has half a million users who use the social network site. The platform was thought of by co-founder Stephen O'Young who wanted to find an easy and safe way to share moments of his son. The idea was then recognised by Eddie Geller and Sarah-Jane Kurtini who jumped on board to be apart of Tinybeans. Instagram users were caught using a practice called 'baby role-playing.' A quick search for the hashtag '#babyrp' has revealed hundreds of these accounts exist, with new ones popping up daily .","50% of parents say they are scared of annoying Facebook friends with 'over-sharenting'

"A businessman who built his own £325,000 toll road to bypass roadworks has said a lack of support from the council means he will not break even. Mike Watts claimed Bath and North East Somerset's reluctance to  install signs and grant planning permission will hurt him financially and result in motorists travelling miles out of their way. The 62-year-old became fed up of a 14-mile detour caused by roadworks after just a few hundred metres of highway were cordoned off due to a landslip. Scroll down for video . Mike Watts, 62, said the council's reluctance over installing signs to highlight his £325,000 private toll road means he will not be able to break even . So Mr Watts rented an empty field next to the popular A431 between Bristol and Bath and spent more than £325,000 to build his own road which he has charged people £2 a go to use since August. In doing this he became the first private individual to build a British toll road in more than a century. He needs 150,000 cars to use the road before Christmas and is already ahead of schedule after recouping two thirds of his risky investment. But, despite more than 125,000 vehicles driving across the toll road he has now said a lack of support from the council means he will not break even. He said he was 'at a loss to understand' why the local authority had not given the support he feels he has needed. 'There are more signs up now saying 'road closed' than before we opened the toll road,' Mike said. The toll road in Kelston, Somerset, which charges £2 for each car has attracted more than 125,000 vehicles . Mr Watts was  was fed up of an hour long detour caused by roadworks after just a few hundred metres of highway was cordoned off thanks to a landslip . 'We have been promised that they would look at the signage. 'Signage on the highways is detrimental to the public gaining access to the toll road. 'We still need not far short of 50,000 [vehicles] in order to break even,' he said. 'It is now a race against time. We were never driven to try and make a quick buck. 'In fact if anyone wanted to make a quick buck I would advise them not to build a toll road.' His planning application for the temporary road was submitted in August costing Mike around £25,000. 'Right up till today there have been constant objections from highways,' he said. 'There have been objections on the website regarding archaeology - where have they dug that up from at this late stage?' The application was due to be considered on Wednesday, but Mike said, in view of the latest objection, he would now need more time to prepare. Toll road cost £150,000 to build and has with running costs of £150,000, plus £25,000 for a planning application . A Bath and North East Somerset council spokeswoman said: 'The road is a private road and not designed to any highway standards. 'The Highway Authority has never been approached with a view to formal adoption of the road and in the absence of any formal consents it is not recognised as a public road. 'This is reinforced by Toll Road which has disclaimer signs informing motorists use the road at their own risk. 'The Council has made a considerable effort to work with Mr Watts and officers and Members have met with him several times. 'We have no obligation to allow his signs on the public highway but have done so; we have also provided expertise, advice and our ground investigation results free of charge. 'The road signs relate to the closure of the road and not the toll road. They are rightly placed on the road rather than on the pavement where they would force pedestrians into the road near a traffic junction and school. 'The Council has been very accommodating with regards the toll road signs and offered to amend this layout and include toll road signage. 'We offered Mr Watts the use of electronic signs (at his cost) and also for his traffic consultant to be involved in designing signage. Neither offer has been taken up. He became the first private individual to build a British toll road in more than a century in August this year . 'We are now nearing being able to determine the application and will seek to do so as soon as possible after considering all the representations received. 'This road is open to the public and has to comply with the normal safety standards. 'To be able to consider this retrospective planning application, we have had to ask the applicant for further details about the construction of the road, including visibility standards and road stability - but we have not delayed the application without good reason. 'The Council has no intention of forcibly closing the toll road.' Despite the fact that the council does not recognise the toll road as an official road and a planning application has yet to be dealt with, Mike said he had received a bill for business rates.

"Five-year-old cancer patient Ashya King has been seen for the first time since undergoing brain tumour treatment - on a family trip to a pizza restaurant. The little boy was pictured clutching a favourite toy and looking healthier than he has done for weeks in an image shared by his older brother Naveed. He said his little brother was 'recuperating nicely' as he enters the final week of his proton beam therapy in Prague. Five-year-old cancer patient Ashya King has been seen for the first time since undergoing brain tumour treatment - on a family trip to a pizza restaurant with his older brother Naveed . Naveed King (right) said his little brother, pictured left before his treatment, was 'recuperating nicely' Ashya has already undergone several rounds of the treatment, with the thirtieth and last of the sessions set to take place on October 24. He was diagnosed with a brain tumour at the end of July and after several operations was set to have chemotherapy and radiotherapy at Southampton General Hospital. But his parents were concerned that this would leave him in a semi-vegetative state and fled the hospital with their son in September. Instead, the pair wanted to have the boy treated with proton beam therapy in Prague. When the NHS said it would not fund the treatment, they fled to Spain where they planned to sell a house before travelling on to Prague. However, Hampshire Police issued a European Arrest Warrant after discovering the family had left hospital in the UK and the couple were held by police in Malaga in Spain. Ashya was taken to hospital and the Kings were told none of the family could visit him. The couple were held in prison for 72 hours before international outcry - including criticism of the 'heavy handed' treatment from Prime Minister David Cameron - led to the order to release them. Following tests Ashya was deemed suitable for proton beam therapy, and in an usual move the NHS agreed to fund the treatment on September 26. Brett King (left) and his wife Naghemeh (right) fled Southampton General Hospital with their son Ashya because they wanted him to have proton beam therapy for his brain tumour . Ashya's family took him out of Southampton General Hospital in a bid to raise money to fund proton beam therapy at a clinic in Prague to treat his brain tumour . His 20-year-old brother revealed that Ashya, who has to be fed through a drip, had even managed to eat a small amount on his own while on the trip to the pizza restaurant. Jana Kulhankova, of the Proton Therapy Centre of Prague, said the boy had been moved into his own private room following his last round of proton beam therapy. 'Ashya left the intensive care unit on Tuesday and has been put in an individual room,' she said. He has 'started to put on weight, he is smiling, and he is reacting to the gestures of his parents and those close to him,' she added. His father, Brett King, said the family are now considering the next step of his treatment which could see them head to Spain. He said: 'Now Ashya has started his proton beam therapy, we need to be thinking about what comes next. 'He still cannot move on his own and he can't talk properly either so we need to think about physiotherapy and occupational therapy for him. 'We have got a doctor who works in Madrid coming to see us soon so he can assess Ashya and his condition. But he will definitely need ongoing treatment in a hospital so we won't be coming home for a while.' He added that Ashya still needs to be fed through a tube and they are still working out the best way to get him to the hospital in Spain. 'Once we meet the doctor, we will have a better idea of what lies ahead,' he said. Brett and Naghemeh King with their son Ashya, 5, at the Motole University Hospital as he waited to have proton beam therapy at a clinic in Prague . Last week it was revealed that the charity which received £50,000 in donations to fund specialist brain tumour treatment for the five-year-old has refused to hand over the cash. Kids n Cancer collected donations of around £50,000 from people supporting the plight of Ashya. The charity says the money was donated for the  proton beam therapy to treat Ashya's tumour. However it said as the NHS had now decided to fund the therapy, the cash will be spent on other children who need treatment. Ashya's older brother Naveed claimed Kids n Cancer have labelled his family 'greedy', and said the charity had never given them money and was refusing to help them cover legal costs. The charity said it was not able to use the money to cover the legal costs incurred by the family because this was not part of the charity's aims. It said Kids n Cancer exists to fund proton beam therapy to help children and their families, and insisted it had not suggested that legal costs would or could be covered by donations.","Ashya King has been seen on a family trip to a pizza restaurant .

"Back by popular demand, a university brought in some irresistibly cute baby animals as part of their 'stress less' strategy in the lead up to final exams of the year. Students of The University of Canberra, in the Australian Capital Territory, bonded with their cuddly and furry friends to help ease their pre-examination jitters. But it's not the first time a petting zoo has paid a visit to the campus, according to the campus life coordinator Dave McCarthy. Irresistibly cute baby animals such as this kitten was at The University of Canberra, in the Australian Capital Territory, on Thursday . Kollie Chan gives this puppy a big cuddle to help her de-stress from her exam studies . Dragomir Mladenovic lovingly looks down at his new furry friend during 'stress less week' 'We've been holding the petting zoo on campus for three years now and the students love it,' Mr McCarthy told Daily Mail Australia. The university's stress less week is held each semester, a week before the exam period begins. Various activities are held throughout the week - a free brekky, barbecue and some acoustic tunes - to treat the students before they embark on a stressful few weeks of exams. Mr McCarthy believes it's an effective strategy which has grown in popularity each year. 'It's because we know that when you hold a kitten, everything just seems okay,' he said. 'You really can't be unhappy if you're around baby animals. 'And we love seeing the pure disbelief on the faces of students when they see a goat on campus.' This goat enjoys a good feed from his student friend as they bond at the petting zoo . Guinea pigs take a well-earned lunch break. The animals visit the university twice a year, just a week before exams . The lambs made themselves comfortable and lounged around during the day . This semester the tiny kittens were a massive hit and in many cases were used as a shoulder accessory, Mr McCarthy said. 'We had lambs, puppies, chickens rabbits and guinea pigs and a pig but the most amusing part of the day was watching people trying to take selfies with the goats,' he said. As for the cage of mice that came along for the fun - they weren't so popular among the students. 'I guess we just wanted a bit of diversity,' Mr McCarthy said.","A petting zoo was at The University of Canberra as part of their 'stress less week'

"Donald Trump has no doubt that his son Eric's wedding to Lara Yunaska will go off without a hitch, despite her recent horse riding accident. The billionaire businessman told MailOnline that 'it's going to be interesting' for Lara, who broke both wrists from falling off a horse last week, to fit her casts into her dress at the wedding on November 8. 'She'll either disguise it, or else she'll hold it up proudly. That'll be interesting, right?' he said. Scroll down for video . The show must go on! Donald Trump has no doubt that his son Eric's wedding to Lara Yunaska will go off without a hitch in two weeks, despite her recent horse riding accident . Trump added that even though her wrists are injured,  it won't have any effect on exchange of rings. 'At least her fingers are exposed. So the ring is good,' he said. 'It's too bad,' he said of the accident. 'But she's really strong, and they dig each other, so that's important.' After she sustained her injuries last Thursday, 31-year-old Lara posted a handful of understandably morose photos of her bandaged wrists to Instagram, captioning one: 'Wedding countdown: 2 weeks and 2 casts to go! #HopeImAFastHealer.' This is an optimistic outlook, since a broken wrist typically takes between six and eight weeks to heal. Optimistic: 'She'll either disguise it, or else she'll hold it up proudly. That'll be interesting, right?' he said of the casts she has to wear for two broken wrists sustained from falling off a horse . I do: Trump added that even though Lara's wrists are injured, her fingers are fine - which means it won't have any effect on the wedding ring exchange . Pushing forward: When asked whether it will affect the wedding plans, the real estate mogul said: 'I don't think so. Naah. No, they're not going to change any of it' Still, the whole family seems to be remaining positive. 'She's doing fine. She fell off a horse, she hurt her wrist, but it's fine. It's not a big deal,' said Trump. 'She's got a cast on it, a small cast on it. And she'll be just fine. No big problem.' When asked whether it will affect the wedding plans, the real estate mogul said: 'I don't think so. Nah. No, they're not going to change any of it.' On Monday, Lara confirmed that she would be getting married as planned by posting a snap of herself on a horse, with the caption: 'There are inherent risks that we all take in life. When you truly love something, it's worth it. Positive: On Monday, she posted on Instagram: 'I wouldn't take back one day of riding - stuff happens. I will ride again and it will be better than ever. Most importantly, I still get to marry the love of my life on Nov 8th' Wedding bells: Lara and Eric, who have been together for six years, announced their engagement last July . 'I wouldn't take back one day of riding - stuff happens,' she added. 'I will ride again and it will be better than ever. Most importantly, I still get to marry the love of my life on Nov 8th.' And the bride-to-be shared the same sentiment with her future father-in-law. 'I asked her that question, is she going to keep riding horses, and her indication was, yes, definitely,' said Trump. Lara, a former personal trainer and now associate producer for Inside Edition, is known to be an avid horse enthusiast, often sharing photos of herself with her prized horses from her home in Westchester, New York.

"Richard Bacon, pictured with his wife Rebecca, who says that he is worried about the poverty gap . Broadcaster Richard Bacon has condemned the gap between rich and poor in Britain – while renting out his home for £15,000 a month. The former Radio 5 Live host calls for an end to an unfair system in which ‘the rich get richer and the poor get poorer’ in an interview to promote the Channel 4 programme How Rich Are You?, which he presents. But that hasn’t stopped him cashing in on the soaring rental value of his £3 million home in North London’s trendy Belsize Park. Bacon, 38, who is moving temporarily to Los Angeles with his wife Rebecca and their two young children, has put the property on the rental market for £3,500 a week. The house, which has more than doubled in value since he bought it seven years ago, is on the books of an upmarket estate agent. It says clients looking for a long-term let will appreciate its off-street parking, 90ft garden and summer house, which can double as a guest room or study. In the interview, which appears in this week’s Radio Times, Bacon complains: ‘Our wealth gap is the worst in Europe. ‘Countries with big inequality gaps have big prison populations, have worse obesity rates, are less trusting, and have higher rates of violence. 'The gap matters, and we want people to understand that. Inequality is a great issue of our time without people being aware of it.’ Scroll down for video . Bacon added: ‘We’re all talking about ebola and ISIS but this is something that is really affecting our country.’ Adding that ‘a debate could start a revolution’, he admits: ‘My house has gone up in value by an absolutely ridiculous amount. ‘I am relatively wealthy and I have had a lot of luck. ‘But that troubles me and it always has. The rich just get richer. Wealth begets wealth. The more you have, the more you get.’ The broadcaster, who was famously sacked as a Blue Peter presenter in 1998 for taking cocaine, left Radio 5 Live in September after four years presenting the mid-afternoon show. The shake-up at the station also saw the departures of Victoria Derbyshire and Shelagh Fogarty. His agent, Russell Garnett, said Bacon would be working on various projects in the US but was not leaving Britain for good. Courtesy of playsuperme . The house, which has more than doubled in value since he bought it seven years ago, is on the books of an upmarket estate agent . The house also has a 90ft garden and summer house, which can double as a guest room or study . According to Channel 4, How Rich Are You?, which is screened tomorrow night, is about Britain in an age polarised between bling and benefits. Bacon told The Mail on Sunday: ‘It examines the polarisation of wealth in the UK and the factors at play determining social mobility. I’m aware that I am relatively wealthy and luck has played a large part in that, particularly in the housing market. ‘Actually, that kind of luck is partly what this show is about.’","Former Radio 5 Live host called for an end to an unfair poverty system .

"It looks like any other office building in New York's Financial District. But 27 Cliff Street has a little more to it than the steady drone of keyboard-tapping and murmured phone calls. It is home to a raucous swinger sex club - and the police claim they are powerless to shut it down. Unsuspecting: This grey office building in New York's Financial District houses a raucous swingers club . The Amsterdam Society, based on the third floor, describes itself as 'the sexist place around' that is 'one part Ibiza style-night club and one part playboy mansion'. It hosts 'wild weekly events' that have enraged their neighbors - three tech companies and a research business. According to the New York Post, the NYPD raided the premises on September 19, but found the antics to be legal as the participants are not paying for the service. They handed the group a summons for selling alcohol before leaving them to continue the event. The club's next event 'Freaky Friday' charges an entry fee of $80 to couples and $20 to ladies - and $120 to 'select men'. It advises participants to 'get naked and have fun' after having their body painted. They are told 'bring your own lock' and there will be 'adult toy giveaway' at some point during the event. Wild: The website advertises 'sexy events' on the third floor of the block which is shared with tech companies . Week night: Workers have blasted the group for the smell and noise left by their parties during the week . On Mondays, guests are treated to a free buffet served by a 'sexy bartender' before they 'dance, drink and watch football'. And the building's other tenants are not happy about it. 'This is an office building. We saw them move eight mattresses up there!' one worker told the Post. 'That was horrendous.' Another said: 'We come in in the morning and you can smell cigarette smoke in the halls. 'We found drugs in the lobby. There's condoms in the trash in the back. 'It's horrifying.' A third raged: 'If they can go that long, God bless them, but we shouldn't have to hear it.' The owner of the building has now filed a lawsuit again the Amsterdam Society, which allegedly claimed to be a video production company when they signed the lease.","27 Cliff St houses tech companies, research firm and swingers club .

"Fishing is known to be a sedentary sport but four men in the Northern Territory have given it a dangerous twist. Risking their lives, the fisherman decided to try and reel in sharks to the shore using a simple rope and a lump of fish as their bait. The bizarre tug of war game that ensued, filmed at a bay in the Cobourg Peninsula, 350 km east of Darwin in the Northern Territory, has been posted on YouTube. Four men went fishing for sharks on the Cobourg Peninsula, 350 km east of Darwin in the Northern Territory . Bull sharks are aggressive and are thought to be responsible for the majority of near-shore shark attacks but the men did not seem bothered. They laughed and joked as they chucked the lump of fish attached to a rope into the water. ‘I’ve got a nibble... here we go,’ shouts one of the men as the rope starts to thrash around. ‘You still got it,' he says reassuring the man holding the rope. The fisherman attached a lump of fish to a thin rope and flung it in the water just metres from where they stood . As a shark took hold of the bait a man cried 'I've got a nibble' and held on tightly . A wrestle ensued as the shark thrashed around in the water and the men tried to pull it to shore . But the rope came away clean with no sign of the fish or the shark . During their numerous attempts in the full-length video the rope comes away clean with no sign of a shark or the fish. 'You've just got to keep walking backwards while it’s shaking its head,’ another man says, implying he’s a bit if an expert. They continue their mission laughing as one man gets dragged into the water and another runs in to back him up. Meanwhile, their friend tries to sneak up to a shark in the shallow water and grab it with his bare hands. Fortunately on this trip the biggest injury they suffered was just a case of bad rope burn.

"Two superheroes have been caught on camera racing each other in a high-speed showdown on water. In perhaps a preview of what fans can expect from the 2016 blockbuster Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice, the two caped crusaders were filmed trying to one-up each other in a barefoot water ski competition. The humorous video in fact stars members of the GB Barefoot Team and was created by 19-year-old Tom Wadsworth, of Bad Wolf Editing. It's a bird ... it's a plane: Superman shows off his flying moves on water in a new video on YouTube . Battle it out: He faces off with Batman as the pair attempt outdo each other in barefoot water skiing skills . Filmed at Weaver Sailing Club in Frodsham, Cheshire, in October, the talented sportsmen battled windy conditions to perform a series of stunts. 'Glass-like water and zero wind is what is required for a good performance,' Tom tells MailOnline. 'The day that we did the shoot, we got up at six o'clock in the morning and it was pouring with rain and howling a gale.' Despite the poor weather, the skiers filmed continuously for 'four to five hours' to get the perfect shot. Speed demon: The superheroes are actually members of the GB Barefoot team . Caped crusader: The sport involves skiing at speeds of up to 40mph barefoot while performing tricks . The superheroes attempted to outmanoeuvre each other as they show off one-handed, no hands and backwards moves while skiing at speeds of up to 40mph. GB Barefoot Team was formed in 1971 and its handful of members include three championship winners, Dave Small, Ted Baber, and Adam Chalk (who appears in the film as Superman). The video has amassed over a thousand views since it was uploaded to YouTube four days ago. The idea came to Wadsworth ( who confesses to being more of a Batman fan) after he watched Man of Steel. He says: 'I wondered, how could I make someone fly like Superman without a multi-million pound budget? Can fans expect some barefoot action on film? Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill star in the 2016 blockbuster . 'This is when I stumbled upon barefoot waterskiing, which was new to me. These two ideas coupled together could make for a really good video and it had never been done before.' Tom is currently studying Product Design at Loughborough University, and has been working on his Bad Wolf Editing YouTube channel in his spare time for a few years. His aim is to turn the hobby into a career. 'It's my true passion,' he says. His editing skills have already landed the budding filmmaker several opportunities, like travelling to Iceland to film the Northern Lights, and to Yellowstone National Park to capture wildlife.","Humorous video was created by 19-year-old Tom Wadsworth .

"A Mayfair casino will not have to pay top poker player Phil Ivey £7.7million in winnings after a High Court judge ruled his 'edge-sorting' technique amounted to cheating. The 38-year-old American had sued Crockfords Club over a version of baccarat known as Punto Banco which he played at the London casino over two days in August 2012. After four sessions, Ivey was told the money would be wired to him and he left for the United States, but it never arrived, although his stake money of £1million was returned. Losing hand: A Mayfair casino will not have to pay top poker player Phil Ivey £7.7million in winnings after a High Court judge ruled his 'edge-sorting' technique amounted to cheating . Genting Casinos UK, which owns more than 40 casinos in the UK including Crockfords, had argued that the technique of 'edge-sorting' which Ivey used - which aims to provide the customer with an element of 'first card advantage' - was not a legitimate strategy and that the casino had no liability to him. Edge sorting involves observing minute details on the reverses of patterned cards, enabling the punter to identify their suit and number. Those with sharp enough vision can eventually overcome the 'house edge', particularly if a croupier is tricked into altering the position of the deck. Its lawyers told Mr Justice Mitting that Ivey’s conduct defeated the essential premise of the game of baccarat so there was no gaming contract or constituted cheating. They said their croupier was tricked into helping Ivey 'edge sort' after he pretended to be a highly superstitious player with obsessive rituals. He successfully convinced staff to let him play repeatedly with a single pack of cards, claiming he believed it was 'lucky'. But the deck had a pattern suited to the 'edge reading' con, the court heard. Ivey's counsel, Richard Spearman QC, had told the court that edge-sorting involved nothing more than using information that was available to any player simply from viewing the backs of the cards which the casino chose to use and making requests of the casino - which it could accept or refuse - as to the manner in which play was conducted. Legal action: The 38-year-old American had sued Crockfords Club over a version of baccarat known as Punto Banco which he played at the London casino over two days in August 2012 . How to win: The technique of 'edge-sorting' which Ivey used - aims to provide the customer with an element of 'first card advantage' MR IVey lives in Las Vegas, has won the Poker World series ten times, and is described on their website as 'arguably the best poker player in the world'. The casino's counsel, Christopher Pymont QC, said that Ivey was not a well-known advantage player at the time of his visit but was, in their eyes, an old VIP customer and they trusted him accordingly. It argued that edge-sorting was not a widely known or practised way of playing baccarat in the UK. Ivey, who was accompanied at Crockfords by another professional gambler, Cheung Yin Sun, who introduced him to edge-sorting, said cheating was anathema to advantage players like him. Champion: Ivey lives in Las Vegas and is described on the World Series of Poker website as 'arguably the best poker player in the world' 'We observe the unwritten doctrine: how do I find a legal way to beat the house? Any method that could amount to cheating would breach the doctrine and cause you to be ostracised by your fellow players - we are all very careful to stay the right side of the line and we discuss advantage play strategies at length.' He said he was very angry when he heard the casino would not be paying out his winnings: 'I was upset as I had played an honest game and won fairly. 'My integrity is infinitely more important to me than a big win, which is why I have brought these proceedings to demonstrate that I have been unjustly treated.' A spokesman for Crockfords said today: 'Crockfords is pleased with the judgment of the High Court today supporting its defence of a claim by Mr Ivey. 'It is our policy not to discuss our clients' affairs in public and we very much regret that proceedings were brought against us. We attach the greatest importance to our exemplary reputation for fair, honest and professional conduct and today's ruling vindicates the steps we have taken in this matter.' Speaking through a spokesman today, Mr Ivey said: 'I am obviously disappointed with this judge's decision. As I said in court, it is not my nature to cheat and I would never do anything to risk my reputation. 'I am pleased that the judge acknowledged in court that I was a truthful witness. 'I believe that what we did was a legitimate strategy and we did nothing more than exploit Crockfords' failures to take proper steps to protect themselves against a player of my ability. 'Clearly today the judge did not agree.' Lawyers for Mr Ivey were refused permission to appeal although they can renew their application to the Court of Appeal directly.

"Brazilian Felipe Nasr has joined Sauber in a shock appointment. Just days after announcing Marcus Ericsson as one of their drivers for 2015, the cash-strapped Swiss marque have now decided on an all-new driver line-up for 2015 by bringing Williams test driver Nasr on board. It means Adrian Sutil and Esteban Gutierrez must find new drives for next year. Brazilian Felipe Nasr will race for Sauber next year in a surprise move by the Formula One team . Nasr was Williams test driver this season and is seen here during practice for last weekend's US Grand Prix . Nasr's appointment is likely driven in part by his ability to bring in around £10-12million in personal sponsorship from Banco do Brasil. Ericsson, previously with Caterham who are now in administration, adds another £10-12million. Team principal Monisha Kaltenborn said: 'We have been following Felipe's career path for some time now, and he fully deserves his position in Formula One having had a very successful career in junior categories. 'We are happy he will be driving for our team next year. This means that Brazil will have one more young and talented driver in the sport. Marcus Ericsson will team up with Nasr at Sauver having been at Caterham who are now in administration . 'Banco do Brasil has been an important partner for Felipe so far, and we are delighted such a renowned company is continuing to support him during this important step. We look forward to this partnership.' Nasr, 22, a former British Formula Three champion GP2 runner-up this season, said: 'It is a very important step in my career to sign with Sauber for the 2015 Formula One world championship. 'This is an unforgettable moment I owe to all of those who have supported me - my family, my friends, my sponsors, my teams and my country. 'Today the dream has come true. Sauber was responsible for the arrival in F1 of great names such as Felipe Massa, Kimi Raikkonen, Robert Kubica and Sebastian Vettel. 'I am proud now to also be part of this racing family. I had a wonderful year at Williams where I learned a lot and prepared myself to be a race driver in Formula One.'","Sauber have overhauled their line-up for next season .

"When it comes to the political arena, he's never been one to pull any punches. And Boris Johnson seemed determined to keep that same philosophy today when he came face-to-face with a new set of competitors. The London Mayor took to the boxing ring in North Woolwich, London, where he sparred with young boxers at the Fight For Peace Academy. Donning his usual shirt and tie, Mr Johnson's gloves were heard snapping against the pads as he entertained the waiting crowd with a series of theatrical ducks and dives. Scroll down for video .

Serious: Mr Johnson's gloves were heard snapping against the pads as he entertained the waiting crowd at the Fight For Peace academy . He was seen grimacing and struggling as he landed his best right-handed punches onto the pads . Members cheered and applauded as Mr Johnson stared into the eyes of his various sparring partners . Despite not being naturally light on his feet, members cheered and applauded as Mr Johnson pulled on his most serious facial expressions and got to work with his bright red gloves. He then stared into the eyes of his sparring partner, before delivering a series of right-handed punches. Ebenezer Ayerh, youth engagement officer, said the Mayor was on site for around an hour, during which he met academy members. He also spoke on the phone with founder Luke Dowdney, who is visiting the sister club in Brazil, before observing a training session. Afterwards, Mr Johnson tweeted: 'Great visit to @fightforpeace in Newham to see great work they are doing with young people in local community.' In 2010, Mr Johnson pledged money to Fight For Peace, as part of a collective £2.4m funding for 18 projects across the capital. The aim of the money was to help increase participation in sport among Londoners. Fight For Peace uses boxing and martial arts to work with young people in the borough at risk of crime and violence.

It's a knockout: Mr Johnson got a sweat on as he delivered his blows, much to the delight of the academy members . The London Mayor has previously praised boxing clubs for being 'overflowing with effort, discipline, respect and comradeship' Since its conception in 2007, 7,000 people have accessed the academy, from all over London. In the past, Mr Johnson has made no secret of his support for boxing clubs in the capital, saying: 'London’s network of fine amateur boxing clubs embody all that is wonderful about sport. 'They are overflowing with effort, discipline, respect and comradeship which are great skills for young people.' It's not the first time Mr Johnson has shown his competitive side in recent weeks. Earlier this month, Mr Johnson joined in a children's football match outside City Hall to promote a new health report aiming to get more children involve in sport. But Mr Johnson ended up issuing a public apology for his behaviour, after sending a nine-year-old stumbling to the floor during the friendly kick-about. The scene sparked shouts of 'Referee!' from the side-lines.","London Mayor visited Fight for Peace (FFP) Academy in North Woolwich .

'The sandwich is actually pretty good. It's actually really good,' Mr Bellamy chimes. The new push comes as McDonald's fights to boost its performance in the U.S., where sales slid 1.5per cent at established locations in the most recent quarter, following a 0.2per cent dip for last year. In addition to increased competition, McDonald's is trying to keep up with changing tastes, with places such as Chipotle marketing their food as more wholesome alternatives. To improve the image of its food, McDonald's recently rolled out chicken wraps with sliced cucumbers and the option to substitute egg whites in breakfast sandwiches. It also plans to eventually let people swap out the french fries in value meals with options like salad or vegetables.","A new behind-the-scenes video takes viewers inside the Lopez Foods production facility in Oklahoma City .

"The father of Anders Behring Breivik has told of his anguish at not having done more to extinguish the extreme views that led his son to massacre 77 people in Norway in 2011. Jens Breivik's dreams are still haunted by the image of his son indiscriminately shooting students at point-blank range on the island of Utoya as he trampled over their classmates' corpses, in what became the largest killing spree by a single person in history. Yet while his nightmares are filled with visions of a monster, his memories are of an angelic five-year-old boy who enjoyed playing in the woods near his home and going on play-dates with his friends. Scroll down for video . Jens Breivik's (left) dreams are still haunted by the image of his son (right) indiscriminately shooting students at point-blank range on the island of Utoya, trampling over their classmates' corpses in what became the largest killing spree by a single person in history . 'What he did was terrible, I can never forgive him for that. Yet he is still my son. I feel sorry for him because I still think that there is some humanity in him,' Mr Breivik told the Daily Mirror from his home in Limoux, France. Breivik detonated a bomb in central Oslo on July 22, 2011, killing eight, then took a boat to an island where the ruling Labour Party were holding a summer camp and shot dead 69 more people, mostly teenagers. Angelic? Yet while his nightmares are filled with visions of a monster, his memories are of an angelic five-year-old boy (above) who enjoyed playing in the woods near his home . He was sentenced to 21 years in jail, the maximum in Norway though the term can be extended if there is deemed to be a risk he would commit new crimes. He now refuses contact with his father, unless Mr Beivik joins his fascist one-man terror cell. 'Last year I phoned the prison to ask if I could visit him,' he told the paper. 'Four months later, I received a letter. It was cold and formal. He addressed it to 'Mr Jens Breivik' and signed it 'Anders Behring Breivik'. 'He was pursuing his ridiculous ideas. He said he'd only accept a visit if I became a fascist and joined his political regime. He won't have contact with me.' Jens Breivik, 78, has had only intermittent contact with his son since losing a legal battle for custody after a divorce from Anders' mother when he was four. Now he wonders what more he could have done to win custody of his son and prevent his son from becoming 'so evil'. 'At that time there was no precedent for a father to gain custody of a child after a divorce. I had to accept that his mother could keep him,' he said. 'I think if I had fought harder, if I had taken him with me, he would definitely have been another person today.' He said at first Breivik showed no signs of extremism, rather, he seemed a happy child. He said when Breivik was 11, he moved back to Oslo from Paris to be closer to him. 'We had good times together but it lasted only until 16, and then I lost contact with him,' he said. 'He became a member of a gang.' Evil: Breivik detonated a bomb in central Oslo on July 22, 2011, killing eight, then took a boat to an island where the ruling Labour Party were holding a summer camp and shot dead 69 more people, mostly teenagers . Happy family? With sister Elisabeth and mother Wench, who took custody of Breivik following the divorce . He said he didn't hear from him until he received a brief phone call from his son saying he was 'doing well' with a company and two employees. Mr Breivik is racked with guilt over not making more effort to see his son during that time. In 2011, he retired to France with his second wife Wanda, 74. He heard nothing of his son until images began appearing on televisions across the world of a man dressed in a policeman's uniform walking calmly through Utoya island shooting dead anyone who crossed his path. Smiling killer: Breivik was sentenced to 21 years in jail, the maximum in Norway, though the term can be extended if there is deemed to be a risk he would commit new crimes . But even then, Mr Breivik did not connect his son with the massacre. It was not until the killer's name was revealed that Mr Breivik understood the horrifying truth. 'I was quite paralysed, I was in shock, I understood nothing,' he told Reuters last month. 'I was in a sort of coma.' But he says one of his greatest fears is the fact his son's fascist, anti-immigrant views seem to be getting ever more extreme in jail. But nevertheless, every thought he has about his son and that unspeakable summer's day in 2011 always comes back to one question: 'I have asked myself, 'Am I to blame for him becoming so extreme?' I ask, 'Could I have prevented it in some way?' 'I don't have an easy answer. It is very difficult being the father of a mass murderer. It keeps me awake. It worries me all the time.'","Jens Breivik, 78, lost custody of son when Anders was four years old .

"Scientists have completed an 'autopsy' - or rather a necropsy, which is an autopsy for animals - on a 9,300 year-old bison. The incredible discovery of the remarkably intact animal was made back in July 2011, but now scientists have taken a look inside. And they have revealed the 'mummy' has a complete brain, heart, blood vessels and digestive system. The 9,000-year-old bison (pictured) was discovered in July 2011 in a remote part of Russia, but scientists have now performed a necropsy revealing it to have a complete brain, heart, blood vessels and digestive system despite dying towards the end of the Ice Age . The most complete frozen mummy of a steppe bison, an extinct bison found on steppes throughout Europe, Central Asia, Beringia, and North America, was found in the Yana-Indigirka Lowland in the Sakha Republic, Siberia. A necropsy was performed to learn about how this animal lived and died at the end of the Ice Age. It showed the animal had a relatively normal anatomy with no obvious cause of death. However, the lack of fat around the abdomen of the animal suggests it may have died from starvation. 'This is a very rare find,' Dr Olga Potapova from the Mammoth Site of Hot Springs in South Dakota told MailOnline. The necropsy on the Yakutia specimen is the first in on the world on such an old bison. Scientists from a number of Russian and US institutions carried out a full anatomic necropsy. This involves removing and describing every organ as well as conducting microbiological and genetic tests and looking for parasites. Histology samples - those showing the microscopic anatomy of cells and tissues of the animal - are thought to prove the most interesting, as scientists will be able to  study parasites attached to ancient bison for the first time. Researchers hope to map a model of an ancient pasture by studying remains of the foods in the bison's digestive organs and to publish their research next year. 'It is one out of three relatively complete steppe bison mummies that exist in the world, and it is the most complete out of those three. 'The body is in excellent condition. Normally, we find the mummies that are significantly damaged by predators in the past, or by modern arctic foxes and others, as soon as mummies are thawed out from the permafrost. 'Such processess happen very quickly, and a mummy that thaws out during summer may be gone in a few months forever. Dr Potapova adds that the bison belongs to an extinct species that was found in the early Holocene epoch - 9,000 to 12,000 years ago. She says there are very few records from species at the start of this epoch, known as the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary. 'This mummy gives us an opportunity to look beyond what for most of the paleontologists impossible to dream of - the opportunity to study genetics and morphology of preserved organs of this animal,' she said. From the necropsy the scientists discovered that the brain appears to be complete, although it has shrunk to 36 per cent of its original volume. However it had retained the bulbs, nerves and even medulla oblongata that once allowed the animal to think. Organs in the throat such as the trachea appeared to be close to their normal sizes, as did the heart, blood vessels, stomach and penis. Some parts of the animal were significantly shrunk though, including the lungs, liver and left testicle. And, as mentioned, the lack of fat in the abdomen and neck suggested it died of starvation. The bison’s brain was frozen by the freezing conditions in northern Siberia, leaving its brain remarkably intact. Here a CT scan of the brain is seen. The scientists hope to map a model of an ancient pasture by studying remains of the foods in the bison's digestive organs and to publish their research next year . 'This is a very rare find,' Dr Olga Potapova from the Mammoth Site of Hot Springs in South Dakota told MailOnline. 'It is one out of three relatively complete steppe bison mummies that exist in the world, and it is the most complete out of those three' 'The Yukagir bison mummy became the third find out of four now known complete mummies of this species discovered in the world, and one out of two adult specimens that are being kept preserved with internal organs and stored in frozen conditions,' said Dr Potapova in a separate statement. 'The next steps to be done include further examination of the bison's gross anatomy, and other detailed studies on its histology, parasites, and bones and teeth. 'We expect that the results of these studies will reveal not only the cause of death of this particular specimen, but also might shed light on the species behavior and causes of its extinction.' Dr Evgeny Maschenkofrom the Palaeontological Institue in Moscow, added: 'The exclusively good preservation of the Yukagir bison mummy allows direct anatomical comparisons with modern species of Bison and cattle, as well as with extinct species of bison that were gone at the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary.' Scientists from a number of Russian and US institutions carried out a full anatomic necropsy, which involves removing and describing every organ as well as conducting microbiological and genetic tests and looking for parasites, on the ancient bision . The creature was found perfectly preserved in July 2011 in the Sakha Republic, also known as Yakutia, where woolly mammoth remains have previously been found. The period began between 9,000 to 12,000 years ago at the close of the Ice Age. Earth began to warm and tundra became forest. Very large animals that had adapted to extreme cold like the woolly mammoth and woolly rhinoceros became extinct - although woolly mammoths may have lived side-by side bison in parts of Russia for a short time. Humans began to hunt smaller animals. One species, Bison priscus to which the bison undergoing necropsy might belong, lived in western Europe, central Asia and later in north America before dying out for an unknown reason. Its body became visible after part of the shore collapsed into the water. 'The discovery has an enormous value for scientists since it is the best preserved bison ever found,' said Dr Albert Protopopov, chief of the Mammoth Fauna Research Department of the Yakutian Academy of Sciences, back in March. He told The Siberian Times: 'We have ascertained that the bison lived 9,000 years ago, at the very beginning of the Holocene epoch and died aged approximately four. 'By that time, many mammoths had died here, but the bison still lived.' 'The careful and thorough examination we have begun will give us answers to many questions, first of all as to why did the bison die out'. Scientists from the Yakutian Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Geology of Diamond and Precious Metals, Yakutsk Agricultural Research Institute and the Agricultural Academy of Yakutsk  carried out the full anatomic necropsy , which involves removing and describing every organ as well as conducting microbiological and genetic tests and looking for parasites. They were joined by the Russian Academy of Sciences and Mammoth Research Centre experts from the US. American scientists have long been studying . bison living in North America and hope to compare them to the animal's . Yakutian relatives. The scientists hope to map a model of an ancient pasture by studying remains of the foods in the bison's digestive organs and to publish their research next year. A close-up of a cross section of the rib cage shows the level of preservation of the ancient animal . The 9,000-year-old bison was found perfectly preserved in July 2011 in the Sakha Republic, also known as Yakutia (pictured) on the shore of a lake in the north of Ust-Yana district, where woolly mammoth remains have previously been found . The scientists hope to map a model of an ancient pasture by studying remains of the foods in the bison's digestive organs and to publish their research next year. Yevgeniy Maschenko, senior researcher at the Mammals Laboratory of the Russian Academy of Science Palaeontology Institute, said in March: 'This is the first study of an ancient mammal for the last 20 years. 'We have a team of experts from various fields. We are keen to learn the animal's morphology. 'All . its internal organs will be weighed and described. All tissue samples . will be taken. Any morphology study [the structure of an animal] is . connected to the study of animal's adaptation to his environment and in . this particular case to study the palae-ecology will be very . interesting. Here, scientists begin the necropsy and it is possible to see the animal's perfectly-preserved hair. Remarkably the brain still had the bulbs, nerves and even medulla oblongata that once allowed the animal to think . He said that histology samples - the samples showing the microscopic anatomy of cells and tissues of the animal - will prove the most interesting, as they will be the first chance scientists have to studying parasites attached to ancient bison. 'Perhaps they didn't preserve, but we will find their DNA and the traces of their activity,' he said. 'By performing biochemical tests and then comparing them by identical tests of currently living worms we will be able to find out what kind of parasites lived 9,000 years ago. 'This will be done thanks to a new technology aimed at studying invertebrates' DNA. It will be used for the first time on the extinct animal'.","Scientists have conducted a necropsy on a 9,300 year old bison .

"Could this be Andy Kaufman's best joke yet — or just another hoax claiming the legendary comedian is still alive? A friend of Kaufman's claims in a new book that the comedian faked his own death in 1984 and will soon emerge for a comeback. Bob Zmuda, who is famous for being Kaufman's close friend and writing partner, says that Kaufman began talking about faking his passing long before his lung cancer death in May 1984, aged 35. 'Could you imagine how this is going to blow everyone's mind?' Kaufman told Zmuda, according to claims from his book 'Andy Kaufman: The Truth, Finally,' as reported by the New York Post. Zmuda — who is not the first person to make fake-death claims about Kaufman — says he had many conversations with his comedic partner about pulling the macabre stunt. Scroll down for video . Best joke ever? A new book about legendary comedian Andy Kaufman claims he faked his own death in 1984 and is about to make a comeback, after his self-imposed 30 years away from the spotlight . Kaufman became serious about the issue in 1982 and wasted no time confiding his plans to Zmuda, the Post claims. The two met at the Canters Deli in Los Angeles, where Zmuda refused to take part in the stunt fearing legal repercussions. Shortly after that, Kaufman told him he would 'fake my death by making people believe I had terminal cancer,' the Post reported. 'People get really wigged out when you start f---ing with death,' Zmuda told the comedian, according to the newspaper. Later, when Kaufman began to cough randomly, Zmuda confronted him and said: 'Stop with the coughing already — I think it's a dead giveaway.' 'I don't know,' Kaufman shot back, according to the Post. 'Everyone seems to believe it.' Kaufman then began joking that he was dying because he 'ate too much chocolate,' but later changed his mind. 'Maybe I'll just stick with cancer,' he said, according to the tabloid. Zmuda . points to one of Kaufman's scripts — written some four years before he . died — as evidence that the comedic genius was already planning on . making a swift escape from life. The . script, from 1980's 'The Tony Clifton Story,' says: 'Tony Clifton, at . the age of 45, died of cancer at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Hollywood, . California.' Four years later, 35-year-old Kaufman would die of the same disease — at the same hospital. Then he outlined his plan for Zmuda. 'If I was going to be a little boy about it, I'd go into hiding for one or two years,' he said, according to the Post. 'But if I was going to be a man about it, it'd be 20 or 30 years.' Kaufman's comedic collaborator, Bob Zmuda, co-wrote the book that claims Kaufman is returning soon with the comedian's girlfriend, Lynne Margulies. She does not think Kaufman may still be alive . By that point, Zmuda says, the whole thing started to feek 'pretty f---ed up.' 'Bob it's who I am and what I do,' Kaufman told Zmuda, according to the Post. 'Nothing could ever top it. 'I've given it great thoughts. Besides, I'm getting psyched — I'm starting an entire new life.' Kaufman then apparently found a body double — who was actually dying of cancer — and started to mimic the man's condition and appearance so his illness appeared legitimate. Once that man died, he was buried as Kaufman while the comedian took off to begin a new life away from the spotlight. Zmuda says he's finally telling his story after giving Kaufman the 30 years he said he'd take to hide before coming back and revealing his prank. Andy Kaufman portrays character Latka Gravas on the sitcom 'Taxi' in 1979 . He co-wrote the book, which comes out October 7, with Kaufman's girlfriend Lynne Margulies. But Marguiles —  who Zmuda claims was not let into Kaufman's supposed fake death  — defends yet another theory of how her boyfriend passed. In the book, she 'floats the possibility' that Kaufman was bisexual and actually died of AIDS, the Post reported. Marguiles and Zmuda claim that Kaufman would often pick up men for sex in San Francisco's Castro District, according to the Post. Kaufman asked the couple to keep his sexuality a secret until his parents died, the duo claims. Since his death in 1984, Kaufman has been the subject of many fake-death hoaxes. Even some of his closest friends still believe he may have pulled off the stunt. Supposed Kaufman appearances, sometimes as his character Tony Clifton at comedy clubs, began shortly after his death. Kaufman performs at Carnegie Hall in New York City . Just last year, a 24-year-old woman emerged at the Andy Kaufman Awards in New York City — and was introduced by Kaufman's brother Michael as the late comedian's daughter. Michael Kaufman told the crowd at the Gotham Comedy Club that he had received a letter from his brother some 15 years after his passing, and that he was alive and well, according to Hollywood Reporter. Then just a few days later, Michael Kaufman appeared on CNN to say he'd been duped. 'I believe I am part of a hoax,' Kaufman's brother said. George Shapiro, Kaufman's longtime manager, told CNN that he saw the comedian die. 'Andy's very much alive in our hearts, but I don't think his body is around,' Shapiro told CNN. 'He died. I was in the hospital.' The hoaxes have become so intense, the Los Angeles County Coroner last year re-released Kaufman's death certificate to put an end to the speculation. In a statement, the coroner's office said only: 'Andy Kaufman is dead.'

"A traumatised policeman says he'll never forget the look of pure hatred in the eyes of a man who doused the officer in petrol, then tried to strike a lighter.

'The look of pure hatred and rage in your eyes as you came at me with the bucket and then again as you thrust the cigarette lighter into my chest and attempted to strike it - I will never forget that look.'

His life had changed forever knowing that had the lighter sparked, he would be dead or terribly burned. 'Despite my lack of physical scarring, you have permanently changed my life nonetheless.' Cregan's lawyer Robert Kane said his client, whose main problem was alcohol, had a horrific childhood but had the support of his siblings and daughter.

"This time last year Andros Townsend was on the verge of something big. Handed his senior England debut by Roy Hodgson in October 2013, the Tottenham winger scored a rasping shot from 25 yards against Montenegro which all but guaranteed the Three Lions’ place at the 2014 World Cup. That strike against Montenegro was voted the fans’ favourite of England’s qualifying campaign. Andros Townsend scored with this rasping drive for England against Montenegro in October 2013 . The winger was hailed by fans after his performance that helped England qualify for the World Cup . Townsend (centre) missed out on England's World Cup squad through injury . 108 - minutes in the Premier League . 234 - minutes in the Europa League . 0 - goals . 0 - assists . (Towsend's only goal this season came for England against San Marino) He was a regular under then Spurs boss Andre Vilas-Boas, a marauding presence on the wing, reminiscent of a certain Gareth Bale who’d just moved to Real Madrid for a record £87million. Since then, his star has faded. The hype stalled. An ankle injury hindered the 23-year-old from ever reaching Brazil. And this season the regular outings at White Hart Lane have become numbered under Mauricio Pochettino. All of Townsend's Premier League appearances this season have come from the bench . He was ruled out for 10 weeks with ligament damage less than two months before the World Cup began and, with that dream shattered, his luck in north London hasn’t improved since. Townsend has become an unfortunate bit-part player for Tottenham, featuring for just 108 minutes in four Barclays Premier League appearances, starting none. He has fallen down the pecking order at White Hart Lane with Nacer Chadli, Erik Lamela, Christian Eriksen and now Ryan Mason preferred by Pochettino. ‘Hopefully, with a few more games in the Europa League and the cup games, I might be ready to challenge for a Premier League spot,’ Townsend says. More than a month has passed since he uttered those words, and the winger remains another young English player struggling to establish himself. It is not entirely dissimilar to the treatment of England Under 21 striker Harry Kane. Pochettino doesn’t fancy either in his Premier League starting XI, and so whets their appetites in the Capital One Cup and Europa League. The winger has had to settle for a starting berth in the cup competitions under Mauricio Pochettino this season . Townsend is poised to take to that role once more in Greece on Thursday evening when Tottenham face Asteras Tripolis in the Europa League, and will be keen to score his first goal of the season for the club. The competition is arguably Pochettino’s best chance of qualifying for the Champions League, with the winner being gifted a place among football’s elite next year. From playing in front of 84,000 fans at Wembley to about 8,000 in Tripolis, though, can prove frustrating. Last year he was battling with Raheem Sterling and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain for his right to be in the England team, now he is warming the bench most Saturdays. Jan Vertonghen said in October 2013: ‘I never enjoyed it when he played on the right wing and I was at left-back (in training). ‘I was asking, “Why is this guy not playing every week, with this talent?"" ‘I think Andros can be our new Gareth Bale.’ The 23-year-old started both Capital One Cup ties against Nottingham Forest and Brighton (above) Harry Kane (far right) is another young Englishman struggling to get Premier League action for Tottenham . He has not been able to settle at White Hart Lane, having been sent out on loan to nine different clubs since 2009. The man that impressed down the right flank in between injuries last year must be beginning to feel his 15 minutes of fame have been and gone. ‘I’ve been out injured watching the Barclays Premier League and seeing everyone doing well,’ he said during a previous injury. ‘That just gives me an incentive to come back and to play even better than I was before.’ Chance would be a fine thing for the Young Lion, and less than 30 minutes here and there in the Premier League may not keep the still-young winger satisfied for long.","Andros Townsend made his England debut in October 2013 .

The . scenes of frenzied Black Friday shoppers more closely resemble hoards . of starving refugees clamoring for vital supplies rather than bargain . shoppers slugging it out for a cheap phone. This year many of the nation's . shoppers had their turkey dinner extra early to take advantage of Thursday evening openings at many stores. Stores typically open in the wee . hours of the morning on the day after Thanksgiving that's named Black . Friday because that is when they traditionally turn a profit for the . year. But Black Friday openings have crept . earlier and earlier over the past few years. Now, stores from Target to . Toys R Us open their doors as early as Thanksgiving evening. Target opened its doors at 9 p.m. on . the holiday, three hours earlier than last year. Sears, which didn't . open on Thanksgiving last year, opened at 8 p.m. on Thursday through 10 . p.m. on Black Friday. Toys R Us opened at 8 p.m., an hour earlier than . last year. And scores of other stores such as Macy's opened at midnight . on Black Friday. Near-riot: Crowds at Wal-Mart battle it out for the bargain cellphone deal . Video: Shoppers fight over cheap cellphones at Mal-Mart stores . Video: Near-riot over the cell phones in Burlington, N Carolina . The earlier hours are an effort by . stores to make shopping more convenient for Americans, who still face . economic uncertainty. Many shoppers are worried about high unemployment . and a package of tax increases and spending cuts known as the ‘fiscal . cliff’ that will take effect in January unless Congress passes a budget . deal by then. At the . same time, Americans have grown more comfortable shopping on websites . such as Amazon.com, where they can get cheaper prices and buy from the . comfort of their home or office cubicle. ‘I ate my . turkey dinner and came right here,’ said Rasheed Ali, a 23-year-old . student in New York City who bought a 50-inch Westinghouse TV for $349 . and a Singer sewing machine for $50. ‘Then I'm going home and eating . more.’ Indeed, retailers . were betting that the earlier openings would draw shoppers who prefer to . head to stores after their pumpkin pie rather than get up early the . next morning. When . Macy's flagship Herald Square store in New York opened its doors at . midnight, for instance, about 11,000 shoppers showed up. Overall, . about 17 percent of shoppers said earlier this month that they planned . to take advantage of Thanksgiving hours, according to an International . Council of Shopping Centers-Goldman Sachs survey of 1,000 consumers. Bargain hunter: A lady in a blue top fights through the crowds to get at the phones . Suddenly there is a surge and the woman in blue gets pushed back . But not to be outdone, the lady in blue uses her bulk to push past her rivals as she fights to get to the goods . Finally the woman muscles her way to the front and grabs herself a cheap phone . In addition to expanding their hours, . many also are offering free layaways and shipping, matching the cheaper . prices of online rivals and updating their mobile shopping apps with . more information. ‘Every . retailer wants to beat everyone else,’ said C. Britt Beemer, chairman . of America's Research Group, a research firm based in Charleston, S.C. ‘Shoppers love it.’ Hardcore . holiday shoppers took advantage of the earlier hours. There were 11 . shoppers in a four-tent encampment outside a Best Buy store near Ann . Arbor, Mich., in the afternoon on Thanksgiving. The purpose of their . wait? A $179 40-inch Toshiba LCD television is worth missing . Thanksgiving dinner at home. Jackie . Berg, 26, of Ann Arbor, arrived first with her stepson and a friend . Wednesday afternoon, seeking three of the televisions. The deal makes . the TVs $240 less than their normal price, so Berg says that she'll save . more than $700. That has put pressure on brick-and-mortar stores, which can make up to 40 percent of their annual revenue during the two-month holiday shopping season, to compete. That's becoming more difficult: the National Retail Federation, an industry trade group, estimates that overall sales in November and December will rise 4.1 percent this year to $586.1 billion, or about flat with last year's growth. But the online part of that is expected to rise 15 percent to $68.4 billion, according to Forrester Research. As a result, brick-and-mortar retailers are trying everything they can to lure consumers into stores by making shopping as easy as possible. They tested the earlier hours last year, but this year more stores decided to open their doors on Thanksgiving.

But while waiting in line they were also using their iPhone to do some online buying at rival stores. ‘If you're going to spend, I want to make it worth it,’ said Caitlyn Maguire, a college student, who spent a total of $175 on Amazon.com, Best Buy and Radio Shack during her two-hour wait. While shoppers snagged early deals, some workers were expected to protest the earlier hours. In fact, a New York-based union-backed group of retail workers called Retail Action Project is planning protests in the Manhattan borough of New York City on Thanksgiving in front of several stores, including AnnTaylor, Forever 21 and others that are opening at midnight on Black Friday and earlier. ‘It shows that the companies are not valuing their workers. They're looking to their workers to squeeze out more profits,’ said Carrie Gleason, director of Retail Action Project. Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, has been one of the biggest targets of protests against holiday hours. Many of the company's stores are open 24 hours, but the company is offering early bird specials that once were reserved for Black Friday at 8 p.m. on Thanksgiving instead. Crowds at Walmart stores battle it out for cheap cellphones . The issue is part of a broader campaign against the company's treatment of workers that's being waged by a union-backed group called OUR Walmart, which includes former and current workers. The group is staging demonstrations and walkouts at hundreds of stores on Black Friday. Mary Pat Tifft, a Wal-Mart employee in Kenosha, Wis., who is a member of OUR Walmart, started an online petition on signon.org that has about 34,000 signatures. ‘This Thanksgiving, while millions of families plan to spend quality time with their loved ones, Wal-Mart associates have been told we will be stocking shelves and preparing sales starting at 8 p.m.,’ she wrote on the site. Shortly after midnight, OUR Walmart said workers walked off their jobs in stores in Dallas, Miami and Kenosha, Wis., on Thursday. But a spokeswoman for the group did not immediately give numbers on how many workers participated. For their part, retailers say they are giving shoppers what they want. Dave Tovar, a Wal-Mart spokesman, said that the discounter learned from shoppers that they want to start shopping right after Thanksgiving dinner. Then, they want to have time to go to bed before they wake up to head back out to the stores. Still, Tovar said that Wal-Mart works to accommodate its workers' requests for different working hours. ‘We spent a lot of time talking to them, trying to figure out when would be the best time for our events,’ he said.Kathee Tesija, Target's executive vice president of merchandising, said Target's 9 p.m. opening struck ‘a perfect balance’ for its customers. When asked whether it's faced any criticism from Target employees, she noted that the chain also works with workers to accommodate their needs. But, ultimately the company serves the customer. ‘We thought long and hard about when the right opening time would be,’ she said, adding that Target ‘wants to make sure we are competitive.’","Footage filmed at Walmart stores in Georgia and North Carolina show crowds trampling over each other to grab an exclusive cut-price offer .

"The wife of a fraudster who pretended to be in a coma for two years wrote a stream of self-pitying letters claiming her husband was unable to move or speak and even tricked their local MP into intervening in his case. Helen Knight wrote the letters trying to convince people that her husband Alan, 47, was in a coma as he tried to dodge court over claims he was scamming a neighbour. She even told her local MP Geraint Davies and the local press that her only way of communicating with him was when he squinted his eyes. Scroll down for video . Helen Knight, whose husband Alan, pictured, pretended to be in a coma for two years, wrote a stream of self-pitying letters claiming her husband couldn't move or speak . Conman Alan Knight (pictured) of Swansea, South Wales faked that he was in a vegetative state after he scammed his next door neighbour out of £40,000 . The mother-of-three from Swansea pretended her husband was in a 'vegetative state' - when in fact he was spotted on CCTV wandering the aisles of Tesco and was spotted on family holidays. Yesterday, Knight admitted 19 charges of forgery, fraud and theft for over more than a year at Swansea Crown Court. The court was told how he 'systematically' funnelled £41,570 out of a neighbouring pensioner's bank account which he used to pay for holidays and to buy a caravan in Dorset. Officers tried to 'at least twice' to bring him court but each time he admitted himself to hospital claiming his condition had worsened. Now it has been revealed that Mrs Knight, 33, won the support of their local MP Geraint Davies, who wrote to police on their behalf after her husband was accused of fraud. Mrs Knight even told her local MP Geraint Davies and the local press that her only way of communicating with her husband was when he squinted his eyes . The family GP also backed her claim that Knight was unable to attend Swansea Crown Court because he was in a coma. Mr Davies, Labour MP for Swansea West, today spoke of his fury about being duped by the scammer and his wife, and called for Knight to face the full force of the law when he is sentenced. 'I went to see Helen Knight, who told me what of appeared to be on the face of it a case of police brutality against a man who was disabled by a medical condition,' he told MailOnline. 'I then made representations for them in good faith which has turned out to be a complete farbrication and hoax. 'They came up with a very detailed fantasy and spun a web of lies - and to say I'm disappointed is an understatement. 'I just hope that Alan Knight is now made an example of by the justice system.' In letters to her local newspaper Mrs Knight begged for help in dropping her husband's case. She said: 'My husband is quadriplegic and in a comatose condition, bed-bound at home. 'I can tell when he is in pain because he goes very red in the face and sort of squints his eyes very tightly like a child who's going to cry. It's the only indication I get.' But despite claiming her husband was in a vegetative state, CCTV images showed him (pictured left in a blue t-shirt) entering Tesco supermarket in Trostre, Llanelli, west Wales . Knight is now facing jail after befriending neighbour Alan Richards then taking £41,570 from his bank accounts between 2008 and 2011. But he tried to beat justice claiming he was a quadriplegic - and was even hooked up to oxygen and had no movement from the neck down. Mrs Knight's letters added: 'My husband has been on bail for nearly five years. 'Last night his solicitor attended my home and stated my husband must attend a hearing at Swansea Crown Court. 'They have had a recent medical letter from his GP stating very clearly as above but are not bothered. 'Obviously any movement is not possible. All involved with my husband's care are outraged. 'There has to be some sort of human rights here, but no one is taking them into consideration. And no one is listening to me. 'We have been through absolute hell and we are going through absolute hell. Former soldier Knight claimed he went into coma several years after breaking his neck in a fall while pulling down a garage door . Local MP Geraint Davies, pictured, agreed to intervene on behalf of the lying couple . 'This case is ridiculous. It's dragged on too long. It's one hurdle after another. 'It's extremely hard going and it's like talking to a brick wall all the time. 'There have been continuous demands for him to attend court and they won't accept his condition. It's horrendous. 'I've told them the doctor has written to them, the MP has written to them. 'I don't feel like I'm being listened to and I don't know where to turn next.' Meanwhile journalists who also visited the Knights' home have also told of how they too were taken in by the fraudster. Photographer Darren Britton, who took pictures of Knight, said: 'He was very convincing - he was twitching as he was laying down in bed. 'His wife was crying, she seemed to be distraught. I had no idea he was pulling such an elaborate con trick - he has taken a lot of people in.' Former soldier Knight claimed he went into a coma several years after breaking his neck in a fall while pulling down a garage door. His wife claimed police dragged him out of the family home in his pyjamas and even dropped him when they lifted him from his special orthopaedic bed. Mrs Knight claimed it left her husband in terrible pain and suffering seizures brought on by police manhandling him. At the family home today Mrs Knight said: 'I do not wish to make any comment, thank you.' Swansea Crown Court heard how Knight was rumbled after CCTV captured him walking around the Tesco and driving his car to Dorset. He was seen in his car at the Severn Bridge tolls on his way home from Christhurch, Dorset, where the family have a holiday caravan. Pictured on Tuesday outside Swansea Crown Court, Mrs Knight pushing her husband in a wheelchair. His wife claimed police dragged him out of the family home in his pyjamas and even dropped him when they lifted him from his special orthopaedic bed . In letters to her local newspaper Mrs Knight begged: 'My husband is quadriplegic and in a comatose condition, bed-bound at home . Police also found the family's Tesco loyalty club card to trace his movements on shopping trips around South Wales and Dorset. Judge Paul Thomas said Knight had been 'putting it on' and had 'managed to pull the wool over the eyes' of the family GP. The judge said: 'Having seen the CCTV evidence from Tesco and driving the car I have come to the conclusion he is putting it on. 'Although a very accomplished and determined actor, he is not in the condition he claims to be. 'The conditions he claims to be suffering from are simply non-existent.' 'He has been monitored, despite attempts to maintain the fiction. He was seen wiping his face and writing things down, which are inconsistent with being paraplegic or in a coma.' Judge Thomas added: 'Aspects of this case in my experience are unique, and a strong message needs to be sent out to anyone who seeks to adopt similar tactics. Detective Con Paul Harry, who led the case, explained: 'In my entire career this is the most calculated, long-term deception of a vulnerable, elderly neighbour I have ever seen. 'He had constantly avoided court for two years, costing police, the NHS and the court system thousands of pounds'. Knight was remanded in custody after admitting theft and forgery charges. He was told he is 'likely' to be jailed when he is sentenced next month.","Helen Knight wrote the letters to convince people her husband was in coma .

"When housewife Jamie Jones found herself a bit lonely, instead of taking up a conventional hobby, or meeting new friends in her area, she started penning letters to American prisoners- with her own husband’s encouragement. She had begun the letter writing in September 2012 as something to do to fill her time but then she fell in love with one of her pen pals, who was locked up for murder. She felt compelled to confess her feelings to her husband Scott but he then banned the 27-year-old, from Southampton, from writing to the criminal ever again. Scroll down for video . Pen pals: Jamie Jones started penning letters to American prisoners with her husband's encouragement but then she fell in love with one who had been convicted for murder . However, he said he was happy for her to keep her 14 other prisoner pen pals, convicted for crimes including drugs, bank robbery and assault. ‘Scott told me to stop writing to Jack,’ Jamie explains. ‘I think he was worried I would fly over to be with him. But he still lets me write to the others as he thinks they appreciate hearing from me.’ Unable to work due to a prolapsed disc, full-time mother-of-one Jamie decided she needed a hobby in September 2012. With Scott working long hours as a driver and canvasser, and their son, Darren, five, at school, Jamie began writing to US criminals after reading about it in a magazine. Bored housewife: Jamie's husband Scott worked long hours as a driver and canvasser, so she began penning letter to US criminals after reading about it in a magazine . Opening up: Jamie was penning letters to prisoners convicted for crimes including drugs, bank robbery and assault. Right: An unnamed prisoner she was writing to . She found a website featuring their profiles. Each one included the inmate’s name, where they came from, the crime they’d committed, their sentence, release date, and a photo. ‘I asked Scott what he thought and he said it would give me something to do,’ Jamie says. ‘He also thought it would help the prisoners feel like they had support.’ Looking through, one profile stood out. ‘Jack was 26 like me and he’d written in his profile that he wanted to get his family out of poverty when he was released,’ Jamie explains. ‘I liked that about him. We also had the same star sign, Leo. ‘At first I was nervous about what to write. I told him I was from Canada and had moved to England to marry my husband who I’d met online. I said we had a son, Darren, and I enjoyed making new friends.’ Passing her days: Jamie found a website featuring their profiles or prisoners - each one included the inmate's name, where they came from, the crime they'd committed, their sentence, release date, and a photo . Betrayal: Scott found out about her falling in love with a prisoner and was angry. 'He said he'd trusted me and I'd betrayed him. I told him that if he'd paid me more attention I wouldn't have looked elsewhere,' she said . When Jack replied, he told Jamie he’d been in prison for nine years, since he was 16. To begin with they wrote once a day. After two months they were emailing each other back and forth throughout the day. Jamie says, ‘I started to see Jack as a best friend, someone I could talk to about anything, even my marriage, so I confided in him that me and Scott were arguing all the time. ‘I felt Scott didn’t understand how lonely I was. Jack Bear, as I’d nicknamed him, knew what it was like to feel isolated.’ Then, last September, when Jack and Jamie had been writing for a year, he sent a letter confessing he had feelings for her. ‘I was stunned,’ Jamie says. ‘I told Scott and thought I’d have to stop speaking to Jack as he’d said he loved me. ‘But he said as long as nothing came of it, I could carry on writing to him. ‘I was relieved he didn’t want me to stop, but I was angry too. ‘Why wasn’t my husband jealous that another man loved me?’ Staying in touch: After Scott found out she fell in love with one prisoner, he banned her from writing to them but didn't mind her writing to 14 other inmates, including one who'd killed his wife in a motorcycle accident. Pictured are two unknown criminals she wrote to . With Scott’s encouragement, Jamie even started to write to some other prisoners. But as time went on, Jamie realised it was Jack’s letters she looked forward to most. ‘My feelings for Jack had deepened. I wondered if it was possible to be in love with two people at the same time,’ Jamie admits. ‘Confused, I confided in Scott’s stepdad. ‘But Scott found out and was angry. He said he’d trusted me and I’d betrayed him. I told him that if he’d paid me more attention I wouldn’t have looked elsewhere. ‘He wanted me to stop speaking to Jack. He was worried that as I’d moved to England to be with him, I could move again to be with Jack. ‘So I contacted Jack to tell him Scott had found out I had feelings for him, and I could no longer write to him.’ Jamie didn’t hear from Jack again. Sticking together: Jamie said she is trying to salvage her marriage and that what happened with Jack has made her and Scott stronger as a couple. 'We've realised what we have together. I hope one day Scott can forgive me,' she said . But Scott didn’t mind her writing to 14 other inmates, including one who’d killed his wife in a motorcycle accident. His name was Shaun and he’d been convicted of drunk driving and homicide. ‘When I read his letter, I felt so sad,’ Jamie says. ‘He’d loved his wife so much.’ Few husbands would be as understanding as Scott. ‘He still supported my writing,’ Jamie says. ‘He said he thought my letters would keep the prisoners sane and feel like they had a connection to the outside world. I like hearing that I’ve brightened up someone’s day with my letter. ‘I want to show that it’s not a bad thing to write to these people, they’re not bad people.’ Now Jamie receives around 20 emails a day and says nothing will stop her writing to the men. ‘They’re not just my pen pals anymore, they’re my friends,’ Jamie says. ‘But I’m trying to salvage my marriage. What happened with Jack has made me and Scott stronger as a couple. We’ve realised what we have together. I'm so happy Scott's forgiven me.'

"The convicted killer boyfriend of a top aide to Bill de Blasio's wife has reportedly left explicit comments on a hip-hop blog touting his love for violent sex. Rachel Noerdlinger, 43, the chief of staff to the New York Mayor's First Lady Chirlane McCray, has been in a serious relationship with ex-convict Hassaun McFarlan, 36, since 2010. McFarlan, whose criminal past, which also includes drug-trafficking and driving offenses, was revealed last week, has now also been linked to distasteful and explicit posts on a music blog, in which he allegedly solicits women to talk about violent sex with him. Dangerous liaison: Rachel Noerdlinger (center), newly appointed chief of staff of the first lady of New York City, has been living with convicted killer Hassaun McFarlan (right) since 2010 . The comments, posted on the Hip Hop News 24-7 blog, ask female users whether they are 'turned on when a man plays rough with you'. the New York Post reported. Another post complains about the sexual abilities of black women - and implies that most of them can't pay their way. It says: 'Trying to find the right black woman with a mean [sex act] game is like trying to find a black woman with good credit.' The words were posted in 2011 under the pseudonym 'stop end frisk'. They have since been deleted but can be seen in search engine data for old versions of the pages. Friends in high places: Noerdlinger (center) pictured with her current boss, Mayor Bill de Blasio (left), and her former employer, Rev Al Sharpton (right) Noerdlinger has rounded on the comments - which she acknowledged as coming from her boyfriend - describing them as 'reprehensible'. The chief of staff joined Mayor de Blasio's team in January as an aide to McCray, and has attended high-level NYPD meetings. This has raised some eyebrows given her live-in partner's attitude to police, whom he has described as 'pigs'. His criminal past, dredged up last week by DNAInfo, goes back to his first arrest at age 15 for shooting to death an older boy in a dispute over a goose-down jacket in Harlem. Most recently, he got in trouble with the law last year when he nearly ran over a New Jersey state police officer while driving his girlfriend’s Mercedes-Benz, according to court records obtained by the news site. Two of McFarlan’s five arrests on charges ranging from driving on a suspended license to drug trafficking took place while he was dating Rachel Noerdlinger. Secret intel: Noerdlinger's critics have expressed concern that the top aide has been allowed to attend high-level NYPD meetings while dating a criminal . The 43-year-old chief of staff got her start as a publicist representing attorney Johnnie Cochran and prominent civil rights leader Rev Al Sharpton, who later hired her as a public relations adviser for his organization the National Action Network. All the while, Noerdlinger's live-in boyfriend has been raving against police officers on social media. In one post, which has since been removed along with McFarlan's Facebook account, he reportedly wrote: 'I cant come outside without the pigs f***ing with me in the hood.' When asked whether the bombshell revelations could result in her dismissal, de Blasio’s spokeswoman Rebecca Katz said: 'Rachel’s not going anywhere.' On top of her game: Noerdlinger, pictured here in 2013 with Al Sharpton and Aisha McShaw, got her start as a publicist before joining the civil rights activist's National Action Network . Katz, however, pointed out that 'no one at city Hall condones criminal behavior or disparagement of the NYPD, including Rachel.' The spokeswoman went on to say that Ms Noerdlinger, a single mother of one, was 'a strong and independent woman' whose core values and believes are in line with the de Blasio administration. Patrolmen's Benevolent Association President Pat Lynch, however, expressed concern regarding Noerdlinger's access to sensitive police information and called into question the aide's judgement. ‘It raises serious questions about her judgment and character and the quality of the counsel she provides to City Hall,’ he told the Post. ‘She should not be in that position.’ Attorney Jeffrey Lichtman, who represents Hassaun McFarlan and Rachel Noerdlinger, hit out at her critics saying that she performs her duties as a chief of staff without any input from her boyfriend. ‘To her credit, she’s a loyal woman and a strong woman and she would not put her career ahead of people she cares about,’ said Lichtman. When approached over the comments, McFarlan refused to respond. The 43-year-old chief of staff, pictured here in November 2013 - around the time of her boyfriend's latest arrest  - is a single mother of one .","Rachel Noerdlinger, 43, has been dating Hassaun McFarlan, 36, since 2010 .

"This is the touching moment a former college football player took to the field again - to propose to his girlfriend during half-time.

"Britain's Secretary of Defence Michael Fallon (right), pictured with  General Sir Nicholas Houghton, said he was ‘appalled’ that legal challenges over incidents in Iraq and Afghanistan cost the taxpayer £85million . A crackdown on ‘absurd’ human rights rulings which threaten to hamper British troops carrying out vital missions was last night signalled by the Defence Secretary. Michael Fallon said he was ‘appalled’ that legal challenges over incidents that happened in Iraq and Afghanistan have cost the taxpayer £85million – money which could have been spent on new kit. The Government is determined to introduce laws restricting a string of court judgements which decree that the European Convention on Human Rights applies on the battlefield. Mr Fallon said the prospect of health and safety-style laws applying to the war zone could seriously impact on Britain’s military capability. Ministers fear the situation has become so farcical that troops will in future have to telephone a lawyer before taking action - even when they are in the heat of battle. The Defence Secretary even raised the extraordinary possibility of platoons taking their own legal advisers on patrol. A series of court rulings in both Britain and Europe have extended the reach of human rights laws over military actions and, critics say, opened the door for a raft of civil claims against the Government. Last year, the families of some British soldiers killed or injured fighting in Iraq were given the go-ahead to bring compensation claims against the Government. The Supreme Court ruled that cases of troops killed while driving poorly-protected Snatch Land Rovers could be brought under the ‘right to life’ enshrined in article two of the ECHR, potentially outlawing the future deployment of troops with outdated equipment. New figures from the Ministry of Defence reveal the overall cost of legal challenges against the Ministry of Defence have topped £85million for the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Millions of pounds have been paid out in compensation to suspected enemy fighters killed or detained on the battlefield. Asked at the Tory conference about rulings that the ECHR should apply on the battlefield, Mr Fallon said: ‘I’m appalled. It’s not just being used, it’s being abused. Mr Fallon said the prospect of health and safety-style laws applying to the war zone could seriously impact on Britain’s military capability. Pictured: British Royal Marines from 40 Commando in southern Iraq in March 2003 . ‘We already have military law and we already have international humanitarian law, we certainly do not need European law in this area hamstringing the efforts of our armed forces in very dangerous situations, the efforts that they make to keep people safe, to detain suspected terrorists and so on. ‘What I’m appalled about was to find that the MoD has already spent some £85million of taxpayers’ money, not on the armed forces, on new kit or equipment, but on London lawyers who are bringing forward these fairly spurious cases. That seems to me very wrong.’ He said Lord Chancellor Chris Grayling was considering bringing forward legislation which restricted the application of European laws on military operations. Mr Fallon added: ‘Otherwise, we’ll end up with every platoon taking a legal adviser out on patrol and that quite simply unacceptable.’","Crackdown on 'absurd' human rights rulings signalled by Defence Secretary .

"Changing tyre: Nine out of ten new vehicles are now sold without a full-size spare wheel as standard, according to research undertaken by a car website . The reluctance of car-makers to provide traditional spare tyres has led to a huge rise in puncture call-outs in just four years, research reveals today. Nine out of ten new vehicles are now sold without a full-size spare wheel as standard, according to car website HonestJohn.co.uk. Around a quarter (27 per cent) are fitted with the ‘space-saver’ tyre, which cannot be used for long distances, and less than half (46 per cent) come with a repair kit – usually comprising an air-pump and a self-sealant. Other alternatives include cars fitted with ‘run-flats’, tyres that are reinforced to allow the motorist to continue driving on a puncture for a limited time. The trend has led to a huge rise in the number of wheel-related call-outs to breakdown organisations. The RAC alone says it has seen the number of motorists calling for roadside recovery due to tyre-related breakdowns rocket from 293,000 in 2010 to 357,000 in 2013 – an increase of nearly a quarter. The rise in calls from drivers without a traditional spare tyre is even more dramatic – up from 29,000 in 2010 to nearly 94,000 in 2013. Remarkably, the RAC predicts it will handle more than quarter of a million such calls next year – a near nine-fold increase on 2010. The RAC has developed its own ‘universal spare wheel ‘ which – which fits eight out of ten cars - and has been used more than 30,000 times since launch in January. A smaller version is being tested for cars like Ford Fiestas and Fiat Puntos . The HonestJohn report says that among the worst manufacturers for lack of a traditional spare tyre or ‘space-saver’ are Volvo, Vauxhall, Porsche, MINI, Mazda, Dacia and BMW, which don’t provide one. Among the best are Italy’s Alfa Romeo, Korean car-maker SsangYong and Japan’s Suzuki which do. It notes: ‘The phasing out of the spare wheel by car manufacturers has resulted in a surge of tyre and puncture related problems, with almost one in three of HonestJohn.co.uk readers reporting a tyre-related breakdown in the past two years. ‘With puncture and other tyre-related breakdowns on the rise, these cutbacks can come at a huge cost to the consumer, with some having to pay more than £600 to buy a full-size spare, in addition to the necessary jacking kit and brace.’ The report notes that the smaller ‘space-saver’ tyres were the most likely spare wheel fitted as ‘standard’ and were provided in just over a quarter (27per cent) of all cars in the research. But the report notes: ‘However, the space-saver is not designed to be driven for long distances, with most having a maximum recommended speed of around 50 mph, restricting drivers to short distances.’ A BMW X6's spare: Around a quarter of vehicles are fitted with the ‘space-saver’ tyre, unsuitable for long distances; less than half (46 per cent) come with a repair kit – usually an air-pump and a self-sealant . The demise of the spare tyre is being accelerated by European Union pressure on car-makers to cut pollution and CO2 emissions from vehicles while improving fuel efficiency, say experts. Dan Powell, managing editor of HonestJohn.co.uk explained that the EU test-cycle for determining a car’s CO2 emissions uses a car’s weight to calibrate the rolling road for the test. The heavier a car, the more fuel it uses and the more CO2 emissions it generally produces. Governments – including the UK – tax a car according to how much CO2 emissions a car produces according to a ‘polluter pays’ principle. So lighter cars usually qualify for lower tax. Mr Powell said: ‘For many car manufacturers, the spare wheel is seen as an easy route to cut weight. A typical 17-inch alloy wheel weighs about 20kg, which can add up to nine grams of CO2 to the vehicle’s emissions. 'In the short run, the owner benefits from lower vehicle tax, but in the long run they could be punished by a costly call out at the roadside.’ RAC technical director David Bizley said: ‘The motor industry is under pressure to meet European and UK greenhouse gas emissions targets and reducing the weight from cars by scrapping the spare wheel helps to make vehicles more fuel efficient. ‘So car manufacturers are increasingly supplying emergency puncture repair kits consisting of a tyre sealant and inflator pack instead of a spare wheel.’ But many drivers find emergency tyre repair kits ‘awkward and messy to use’, he said. And often they can’t drive the car away afterwards as sealant kits only work with small holes. Mr Bizley added: ‘Many people don’t realise they don’t have a spare this until it’ s too late. They often say I’ve just spent £20,000 to £30,000 on a new car and I don’t get a spare.’","Around a quarter of new vehicles sold come with only a 'space saver' tyre .

"Nearly three-quarters of all Airbnb rentals in New York City are illegal because they violate zoning regulations and other laws, according to a new report released on Thursday. Airbnb in the City was compiled by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and has found that commercial operators are abusing the website which promotes itself as part of the ‘sharing economy.’ While Airbnb likes to promote how the service can help homeowners supplement their income and give visitors more usual traveling experiences, the report found that large commercial operators supply more than a third of the units being advertised and generate more than a third of the revenue. Nearly three-quarters of all Airbnb rentals in New York City are illegal, according to a new report released by Attorney General Eric Schneiderman on Thursday . The report, which is based on four years’ worth of data that the attorney general only secured after a court fight, found that a small number of landlords are using the home rental service to run what amount to illegal hostels. Following the release of the report, Airbnb - which is valued at $10 billion - admitted that better regulation would help ensure it doesn’t become overrun by large-scale commercial operators. ‘We need to work together on some sensible rules that stop bad actors and protect regular people who simply want to share the home in which they live,’ spokesman Nick Papas told the New York Times. Schneiderman and city regulators are set to announce a new joint enforcement initiative on Thursday to shut illegal hotels down. Regulators will investigate violations of building and safety codes and tax regulations. Airbnb seeks to promote how the service can help homeowners supplement their income and give visitors more usual traveling experiences . ‘Anyone operating an illegal hotel should be on notice that the state and city will take aggressive enforcement actions in this area,’ Schneiderman told the Times. ‘A slick advertising campaign doesn’t change the fact that this is illegal activity.’ Airbnb has said that the vast majority of properties advertised on the site are not ‘illegal hotels’ ‘Most of our hosts are regular New Yorkers, and the overwhelming majority live outside of Manhattan,’ said Papas. He said that New York’s ‘myriad’ of complex housing rules make it difficult to prove the report’s claim that 72 percent of listings were illegal . ‘Every single home, apartment, co-op and living space in New York is subject to a myriad of rules, so it’s impossible to make this kind of blanket statement,’ he said. ‘That kind of uncertainty and lack of clarity is exactly why we’re advocating for clear, fair rules for home sharing.’ According to Airbnb only 18 percent of its New York rentals are 'where the hotels are,' which it defines as Midtown Manhattan . According to Airbnb only 18 percent of its New York rentals are 'where the hotels are,' which it defines as Midtown. The attorney general’s report found that the most popular rental areas were all in Manhattan - the Lower East Side/Chinatown, Chelsea/Hell’s Kitchen and Greenwich Village/SoHo. These three accounted for 40 percent of private stay revenue, or $187 million. Reservations in Queens, Staten Island and the Bronx accounted for just 3 percent, or $12 million. In April, in the midst of Airbnb’s negotiations with Schneiderman over turning over its data, the company said it was expelling hosts with 2,000 listings in New York because they ‘weren’t providing a quality, local experience to guests.’ A Quinnipiac poll last month revealed that 56 percent of NYC residents agreed that New Yorkers should be able to rent rooms to strangers like a hotel, while 36 percent said no.","New report released by NYC Attorney General Eric Schneiderman on Thursday claims majority of listings violate numerous regulations .

"Some may say that a cafe with no bacon is like a pub with no beer but a business has been forced to take the popular breakfast item off the menu. The smell of bacon cooking can really get your taste buds going but a bridal store in the Wintergarden shopping centre in Brisbane, Queensland has complained about the fatty aroma coming through the air conditioning vents from the nearby Gramercy Coffee cafe. After cooking bacon since January last year, cafe owner Mitch Suchowacki received a letter from the centre's management last month pointing out that his lease did not allow him to cook items that required an extraction fan. Mitch Suchowacki has been banned from using bacon at his cafe and now uses jamon instead . Mr Suchowacki said he had been approached by management earlier in the year about the quantity of bacon being cooked. 'We used to just fry it on the grill which was quite smelly I guess, so then we started baking it in the oven which heavily reduced the smell and we thought everything was good because we hadn't heard anything since that,' he told Daily Mail Australia. But now the bacon has had to be replaced on the menu with jamon - thinly sliced cured ham. Mr Suchowacki is disappointed about the way the issue had been handled with Winnie bridal shop. 'We have had zero communication with the bridal store which has frustrated me a little bit,' he said. 'If they had just approached us I would have been very happy to look at the options, or rework our menu, or do whatever is possible because we don't really want to be at odds with another tenant.' Mr Suchowacki (far right) with his staff at Gramercy Coffee cafe  where the smell of cooking bacon has upset a nearby bridal store . However, Mr Suchowacki understands why his fellow tenant was upset about the situation. 'I would not be happy if I felt that a smell detracted from business - so I really get where they are coming from but i just felt that the way it was handled by themselves and management wasn't an appropriate way to do it.' But he added that there also needed to be a 'level playing field'. 'You can always smell different things from the food court and I think that's an attractive part of the centre - to have a bit of a sensory experience, so I'm not sure why we are the only ones who have this issue when there is so much going on in the centre,'he said. The Wintergarden shopping centre's management was uncontactable on Sunday but The Courier Mail reported that a centre spokesperson said the cafe's lease stated that cooking bacon 'is not and has never been permissible'. Mr Suchowacki said most customers had accepted the menu item exchange with only a few upset that they can't have their 'Saturday morning bacon and eggs.' Daily Mail Australia contacted the Winnie bridal shop but did not hear back before publication. It stipulates in Mr Suchowacki's lease agreement that he was not to cook food which needed an extraction or exhaust fan .","Gramercy Coffee cafe has been banned from using bacon .

"A mother's leg ballooned to twice its size after she was bitten by what is believed to be a false widow spider. Shireen Larsen, 33, from Enfield, Middlesex, feared she would lose her leg after an infection from the bite caused the limb to turn black, yellow and covered in huge blisters. She also began vomiting after being bitten by the venomous creature in the beer garden of the Crown and Horseshoe pub, Enfield. Scroll down for video . Shireen Larsen (left), from Enfield, north London, feared she would lose her leg after it swelled to twice its size when she sustained a bite from what is believed to be a false widow spider (right) Ms Larsen initially went to her GP and was given antibiotics, but she had to be rushed to nearby Chase Farm Hospital after the infection caused her leg to double to twice its size. She spent three days being treated in hospital and is still struggling to walk. Ms Larsen, a learning support assistant, said: 'I had to go to the hospital. I was completely petrified; I thought I was going to lose my leg or something worse because of the bite.' The mother said she watching her daughter and her friend's child play in the garden when she felt a sharp bite on her leg. She then felt a tingling, followed by a numbness, as the infection began to take hold. She said: 'I was sitting in the beer garden while my daughter and my friend's child were playing and I felt a sharp bite on my leg. 'I brushed the spider off immediately and my leg started to go numb and felt itchy. My condition deteriorated and I started vomiting and huge blisters swelled up on my leg.' Ms Larsen saw her GP, who prescribed her antibiotics. But her condition soon deteriorated and she says her leg doubled in size. Three days later, she went to hospital, fearing she might lose her leg. As well as her leg turning black and yellow, it also became covered in huge blisters, pictured . Earlier this week, hairdresser Andrea Wallace told how she had to have one of her fingers amputated after a bite from a false widow spider that she sustained in Seaham, Country Durham, led to her catching a flesh-eating bug. Ms Larsen said: 'At the hospital, the bed was not working properly so I had to prop up my leg with a stool which meant I had a very uncomfortable night's sleep. 'I don't know if it was a false widow or not but the people at the hospital said they had never seen a bite like it before.' Ms Larsen is now out of hospital. She has been prescribed ten different types of medication. They've inspired terror into millions, sparking complaints that their danger has been over-hyped. So what are false widow spiders? Much of their reputation is thought to be thanks to the black widow, which although similarly named is far more dangerous and has been known to kill children, ill or elderly people. Although its bites can be intensely uncomfortable - swelling hugely when infected - the false widow (above) is not known to have caused any deaths in Britain. By comparison, around four Britons each year are though to die from bee or wasp stings when they have an allergic reaction. False widow spiders are distinctive with their shiny, black flesh, bulbous bodies, thick legs and skull-like patterns. Millions of false widows, Britain's most venomous spider, are found across the UK and the population is growing. Also known by its Latin name Steatoda Nobilis, its first British sighting was in Torquay, Devon, in 1879 and is thought to have remained largely in southern England. But the Natural History Museum says warmer summers mean the spider is spreading north, a theory backed by wildlife sightings. Describing the spider, she said: 'It was a small dark brown or black spider but it was hard to tell because it was night time. 'I am originally from Zimbabwe and I have seen all sorts of spiders out there but this is the first in this country. You can still see the bite on my leg even now. 'I think people should be made aware that these spiders are out there in Enfield and people should be on the lookout.'

As Britain's most venomous spider species, false widows made headlines last year when victims told how they had suffered huge wounds and almost lost limbs. An entire secondary school was shut in October last year in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, after an outbreak of the arachnids in its ICT block had to be fumigated. In the worst cases, suspected bite victims have been treated in hospital or complained of ongoing health problems several months later. But many experts insist the spiders are not particularly dangerous and will only bite if approached or handled. There have been no reported deaths from the spiders in Britain, where they are believed to have arrived on crates of fruit from the Canary Islands in the 1870s. It is thought many of the worst reactions happen when bites become infected, rather than being linked to the spider's venom itself.","Shireen Larson, 33, from Enfield, Middlesex, was bitten in pub garden .

"Joan Rivers' personal doctor has said reports she took a selfie with the star before the procedure that allegedly killed the comedienne are 'lies'. Dr Gwen Korovin - who was not authorized to be in the room at the time of the fatal treatment - has also released a statement saying she has 'no comment' to make about the tragic incident. Reports suggest the 'throat specialist to the stars' took a photo of the 81-year-old inside Yorkville Endoscopy clinic on August 28 before the star stopped breathing while undergoing a procedure on her vocal cords. However sources close to the ENT have accused CNN - who originally published the story - of 'making up lies'. Scroll down for video . Dr Gwen Korovin has released a statement saying she has 'no comment' to make about the tragic incident . According to TMZ she has also denied performing a biopsy on Joan. However it is unknown whether she performed any other procedure while in the room. Attorneys from Abrams and Fensterman acting on behalf of the medical professional released a statement  today, saying she is 'respected and admired' in the medical community, but will not be discussing the incident. It read: 'Gwen S. Korovin M.D. is a highly experienced, board certified otolaryngologist. She maintains priveleges at one of the city's most prestigious hospitals. She is respected and admired by her peers in the medical community and she is revered by her patients. 'As a matter of personal and professional policy, Dr Korovin does not publicly discus her patients or their care and treatment. Further, Dr Korovin is prohibited by state and federal confidentiality laws from discussing her care and treatment of any particular patient. 'For these reasons, neither Dr Korovin nor her attorneys will have any public comment on recent press reports regarding her practice. We ask that the press pleases respect Dr Korovin's personal and professional policy of not discussing her patients as well as the privacy of her patients.' The doctor who counts Hugh Jackman, Julie Andrews, Lady Gaga, pop princess Ariana Grande and Celine Dion among her celebrity patients, is an esteemed ear, nose and throat specialist based in Manhattan. Joan arrived at the Upper East side clinic for an endoscopy with gastroenterologist Dr. Lawrence Cohen, Yorkville's medical director, on the morning on August 28. She died on September 4. The procedure was intended to help diagnose her hoarse voice and sore throat, and involved the insertion of a camera down her throat. An ear, nose and throat specialist - who was not certified by the clinic, as required by law - then performed a biopsy on the star's vocal cords. The doctor was described by the source as Joan's personal ENT specialist who is reported to be Dr Korovin. Response: The 56-year-old, pictured outside her Manhattan home this weekend, has released a statement via her lawyers which says she cannot comment on the tragic incident which led to the 81-year-old's death . It has been reported that Joan's vocal chords began to swell during the biopsy, cutting off the flow of oxygen to her lungs, which led to cardiac arrest. The comedienne was then rushed to nearby Mount Sinai hospital from the clinic. However, she never regained consciousness and died days later after being taken off life support and spending her final days with her daughter Melissa Rivers by her side and her loved ones paying their final respects. Dr  Korovin has been earmarked as one of the top specialists in the country and is the choice of many celebrities. She has even been involved in a documentary with Celine Dion. During a clip from the program, Dr Gwen Korovin is seen conducting an laryngoscopy on the Canadian singer, using a camera to examine Dion's vocal chords as she sings a few notes. The two go on to share a few laughs in Dr Korovin's clinic room, covered with framed photos of her famous clientele.

"The United States has no plans to restrict travel from African countries hard-hit by the Ebola virus epidemic, the Obama administration said Monday. At the same time, the president's chief spokesman said the U.S. won't absolutely rule it out. 'A travel ban is not something that we're currently considering,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters. 'We feel good about the measures that are already in place,' he insisted. White House on tilt? Obama's aides are facing tough questions from reporters who demand to know why planes from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea are still allowed to land at US airports amid an Ebolaepidemic . Now arriving in the US: 77 sick patients believed to be infected with Ebola have been stopped from boarding planes bound for America, and the White House says that's enough to suggest the planes can still come . Global village: West African nationals can connect to the US via Nigeria or Europe and the White House says the planes have to continue flying if supplies and aid workers are to reach those in need . 'Our experts continue to be confident that the medical infrastructure that we have in this country is sufficient to prevent an Ebola outbreak from occurring,' Earnest said. He continued Monday to project confidence, which some have interpreted as reassuring while others see it as complacency. Still, he adopted a never-say-never attitude when pressed on the subject. 'This is something that we regularly assess and re-assess, and – so I wouldn't rule out any changes in the future,' he said. Earnest explained that a back-and-forth flow of aviation traffic is needed in order to fight the Ebola outbreak from an ocean away. 'We're relying on the commercial transportation system to move supplies and personnel into the region,' he said. 'So we don't want to obstruct one of the core components of our strategy.' The administration is relying heavily on what Earnest called 'a multi-layered screening protocol' to spare Americans from the kind of public health devastation that has brought three countries to their knees and killed thousands. 'There are extensive screening measures on the ground in west Africa where this outbreak has occurred,' he said, adding that 'there's guidelines and guidance and training that has been given to flight crews.' 'There also is a protocol in place for Customs and Border Patrol officers who are manning our ports of entry,' Earnest added, 'to be on the lookout for individuals, again, that may be exhibiting symptoms of Ebola – in other words, that are contagious with Ebola.' But health officials said Sunday that they are considering the approval of new measures designed to provide the U.S. with one extra firewall, such as checking the body temperature of everyone who enters the U.S. from an affected nation. Death toll keeps tolling: Red Cross workers loaded the body of this Ebola victim onto a truck for disposal on Sunday . Setting boundaries: US Air Force personnel mark out the location of a future field hospital in Liberia with razor wire, which could be needed to keep hordes of patients out of the few clinics available . Other pandemics have seen similar strategies. In 2009, at the height of the avian influenza scare, China and other Asian nations required temperature checks of every passenger deplaning in Beijing and other major points of entry. But those modest steps, like the more drastic travel ban proposals, are just drawing-board ideas. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Dr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday that a 'discussion is underway right now' and 'all options are being looked at' for new U.S.-based screening plans. But the question, he told CNN, is whether 'the extra level of screening is going to be worth the resources you need to put into it. At a press conference Sunday, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention chief Dr. Thomas Frieden declared: 'There's no doubt that we can stop Ebola in this country.' He also said current screening protocols in Africa have stopped 77 potentially Ebola-infected people from boarding planes to America. The Ebola virus is transmitted via contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person. The current strain of the virus is believed to have killed about half of the people it has infected in Africa. U.S. officials stressed Friday during a White House press conference that America's public health system is more robust and will adequately protect the public.","77 people have been prevented from boarding US-bound planes in west Africa, but the CDC doesn't know what it doesn't know .

"Pretty in a shimmering navy silk cocktail dress, Monaco's Princess Charlene looked every inch the royal mother-to-be as she arrived for an event in Palm Springs hand-in-hand with her husband. The royal, 36, is expecting twins in December and her bump was clearly visible as she made her way into an awards ceremony held in honour of her late mother-in-law, Princess Grace. Monaco's ruler, Prince Albert, and his wife have spent the last week in the US on behalf of the Princess Grace Foundation, which supports up-and-coming actors. Not long now: Princess Charlene is nearly seven months pregnant and due to give birth in December . But after it was revealed that the Monégasque royals were expecting twins last week, all eyes have been on Princess Charlene's bump. Clearly unfazed by the attention, Charlene looked relaxed and happy and beamed at well-wishers as she arrived for the event. For his part, Prince Albert was every inch the protective father-to-be, clutching his wife's hand and smiling solicitously as he ushered her into the venue. The Monégasque royal couple are currently in California on behalf of the Princess Grace Foundation and have attended several receptions, including the Palm Springs ceremony, since arriving. While much of their schedule has focused on the work of the Princess Grace Foundation, the couple also took time out to visit a children's centre in Rancho Mirage on Saturday. All smiles: The couple smiled at each other as they arrived for the Princess Grace Foundation event . Tour: The couple have spent the last week in the US, attending events for the Princess Grace Foundation . There, the couple were introduced to Barbara Sinatra, the fourth and final wife of singer Frank, with Prince Albert gallantly planting a kiss on Mrs Sinatra's hand. And Mrs Sinatra isn't the only big name well-wisher to meet the couple during their tour of California. As news of the impending arrival of twins broke, the couple were rubbing shoulders with director Adam Shankman and Glee star Jayne Lynch, at a gala supper in Los Angeles. The day before, the couple had lunched with another set of A-listers, among them Jerry Bruckeimer, Mel GIbson and Sylvester Stallone. The high-profile events were all for the Princess Grace Foundation, which awards fellowships and grants to promising up-and-comers in the entertainment industry, including dancers and actors. Albert is the vice-chairman on the board of the organisation, and is often in attendance at its events, one of which is an awards ceremony. Charity: On Saturday, the couple spent the day at the Barbara Sinatra Children's Center in Rancho Mirage . Gallant: During the visit, Prince Albert planted a kiss on Barbara Sinatra's hand . Princess Charlene, who is nearly seven months pregnant, is also involved with the Foundation's activities and has a charity of her own, the Princess Charlene of Monaco Foundation, which focuses on sport, swimming in particular. But with twins on the way, talk has now turned to the succession, with pundits left contemplating the question of how the birth of multiple babies might affect the succession. According to Monaco's constitution, the first-born baby is the closest in line to the throne, with priority given to males. But should both babies be boys - or indeed girls - working out which is first could prove a constitutional headache, with some arguing that the second baby born should be first in line as that child was conceived first. Looking good: For the visit to the children's centre in Rancho Mirage, Charlene was pretty in gold and cream . Succession: Since the couple announced twins were on the way, talk has turned to the succession . This is not the first time that the question of Monaco's succession has become vexed, with Prince Rainier quietly changing Monaco's constitutional laws in 2002 to allow his daughters, Caroline and Stephanie, and their children to inherit the throne should Albert fail to marry and produce an heir. Now, however, those changes are obsolete with not one but two heirs on the way - much to the excitement of Prince Albert. In June, the royal told the Associated Press that he and his wife were 'overjoyed', 'thrilled' and 'very excited' about the impending arrival of their child - or children, as they are now known to be.

The delighted father-to-be also spoke of the precautions the pair were taking, adding that they are 'taking every cautious step to make sure everything goes well'. Albert, 56, has two other children - daughter Jazmin Grace Grimaldi, born in 1992 to American Tamara Rotolo, and Alexandre Coste, born in 2003 to Togolese air hostess, Nicole Coste. Under Monaco's inheritance laws, neither of Prince Albert's two illegitimate children have no claim to royal titles and are not considered his official heirs. His daughter Jazmin was born in California to a former waitress with whom Prince Albert had a brief fling. Now 22, she recently graduated from Fordham University in New York. His son Alexandre, now ten, lives with his mother, a former Air France hostess from Togo, on the French Riviera. Prince Albert reportedly demanded DNA tests for both children before accepting paternity. With an average of 3.5 sets of twins born per 1,000 pregnancies, an instant family of two babies - even royal ones - isn't unusual. Georg Friedrich, Prince of Prussia is one royal parent of twins, who with wife Princess Sophie of Isenberg welcomed Carl Friedrich and Louis Ferdinand in 2013. Another is Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark and his wife Mary, who became parents to Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine in 2011. Prince Louis Alphonse, Duke of Anjou is yet another royal father of twins, following the birth of Prince Louis, Duke of Burgundy and Prince Alphonse, Duke of Berry, to his wife María Margarita Vargas Santaella in 2010. But although royal twins are fairly frequent among European dynasties, among them the Monégasque couple, British royals are an entirely different story with just one set born in the last 2,000 years. Born to King James I of Scotland and his wife Joan Beaufort in 1430, Alexander and James were the first and only twins born to British royal parents. Tragically though, Alexander, the eldest of the two, died before reaching one - with his younger brother later taking the throne of Scotland as James II. During his marriage to Mary of Guelders, James sired no fewer than seven children, all of them in separate pregnancies. Despite the lack of British royal twins, odds have shortened on another set of royal twins - belonging to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - being announced. While the Monégasque rules of succession are clear, the British rules aren't set in stone, although as the new baby - or babies - will be spares, the question of who inherits what is less vexed. In theory, with Prince George already in the royal nursery, the new babies would come behind him with the elder becoming the spare while the younger would have no real role. As for which parent is responsible for the Monégasque royal twins - or the British ones, should they come to pass, Consultant Gynaecologist Dr Andrew Paterson says both could be behind a multiple birth, although the mother is the more likely candidate. ‘Twins are not genetically based,' he explains. 'Monozygotic twins are more rare and when a single fertilised egg divides in two, creating identical twins. ‘Another way is when a mother release two eggs at ovulation and both are fertilised, creating non identical twins. ‘If either the mother or the father have twins in their family, the chances of them having twins is higher.’ A crown fit for two? Princess Charlene and Prince Albert II of Monaco announced on Tuesday that they expecting twins - which has led many to speculate which baby will inherit the throne . Wedding bells: Charlene, 36, a former Olympic swimmer from South Africa, married Prince Albert in July 2011 . 'The truth is that, I'm sorry to say, Albert hasn’t seen Alexandre since a brief visit last September,' she claimed. 'It has become impossible since he married that girl.' In 2005, Prince Albert said in an interview with Larry King that while Alexandre will never inherit the throne, 'he will be very well taken care of' - presumably financially. While it's rare for a noble figure to have twin heirs, it has happened before - most recently in 2009, when David Cholmondeley, the seventh Marquess of Cholmondeley, welcomed twin boys with his wife Rose Hanbury, a former fashion model 23 years his junior. Born by C-section three months premature, the boys were named Alexander Hugh George and Oliver Timothy George. Older by a few minutes, Alexander is the heir-apparent to the Marquessate and bears the courtesy title Earl of Rocksavage. Oliver is known as Lord Cholmondeley.

"The Godfather's Michael Corleone: Italian courts are trying to ensure their mobsters' sons don't go down the same route by taking them from their families . First Italy fought its mafia mobsters by confiscating their wealth. Now judges are taking away something more precious: their sons. Riccardo Cordi', a shy 18-year-old scion of one of Italy's most notorious mob families, is a pioneer in a new strategy to fight the mafia by exiling crime clan sons from their homes and families. Riccardo is the first of about 20 sons sent into a kind of rehab away from the mob by juvenile courts in the southern region of Calabria, home to the dangerous 'ndrangheta syndicate. By age 16, Riccardo seemed destined to go the way of his father, a reputed boss gunned down in a turf war, and three elder brothers in prison on mafia-related convictions. Their photos line the wall of the fortress-like Cordi' home in Calabria, seen in an exclusive visit by The Associated Press, in a testimony to the rule of blood in the powerful 'ndrangheta. But when Riccardo was charged with attempted theft and damage to a police car, judge Roberto Di Bella followed up his acquittal with a startling order: The 'ndrangheta family prince would be sent away to Sicily until he turned 18. Di Bella had sent Riccardo's three brothers to prison and wanted to spare the last son a similar fate. He cited legal provisions that allowed courts to remove minors from families incapable of properly raising them. Riccardo's mother seethed, but there was nothing she could do. 'If you don't like it, we'll take him away anyway,' the judge told her. Riccardo was placed in a Sicilian facility for troubled youths where nobody cared that he was a Cordi'. Rules were rigid, including no going out at night. Everyone made their own bed and sat down for meals at a communal table. 'It was tough. I was counting the days,' Riccardo said in interviews with the Associated Press. The judge put Riccardo under the wing of a fledgling psychologist, Enrico Interdonato. The psychologist had helped launch a courageous band of youths who encourage Sicilian business owners to stop paying 'protection' money to the Mafia. It was an audacious pairing, because the Cordi' crime clan was itself alleged to be in the protection racket. This unlikely mentor helped Riccardo understand the terrible human toll of organized crime, taking him incognito to ceremonies for Mafia victims. Italian Carabinieri police officers stand in front of the entrance of a Calabrian court after a bomb explosion: A court sent Riccardo Cordi', an 'ndrangheta family prince, away to 'rehab' in Sicily until he turned 18 . If the psychologist acted as a surrogate brother, a construction company owner practically became Riccardo's second father. Mariano Nicotra told Riccardo what happened when he refused to pay protection money: His car was torched, his daughter ostracised. Nicotra even gave away the family dog, because Mafia threats made walks dangerous. Slowly Riccardo began to change. Twice a week, he helped out at an after-school center for children from broken homes, even though doing something for nothing is an alien concept in the 'ndrangheta. He moved stiffly, always buttoned up, wearing a jacket even at outings at the sea. But he came willingly, a supervisor recalled. One day, he surprised everybody by clucking like a hen to make the children laugh. 'Ndrangheta heartland: The beach near the town of Locri, Calabria, were Cordi' is from . Riccardo's exile wasn't all hard work. On Saturday nights, Interdonato took Riccardo out for pizza and beers, and even to discos. There, he earned respect because of his personality, not his name. Just weeks before he was due to leave, Riccardo rebelled. He packed his bags. He wanted out. His mother helped persuade him to stay. On his 18th birthday - February 8, 2014 - Riccardo's exile ended. The after-school center treated him to a birthday cake with strawberries. Soon afterward, he returned home to Locri. In a letter to Corriere della Sera in May, Riccardo made clear he wasn't repudiating his family. But he wrote that he now wants a 'clean' life. He recalled how one morning in exile, he went to the sea, from where he could see Calabria. 'This time, however, I saw it from another perspective: I was seeing it from another place,' he said. 'But it was I who was different.'","Riccardo Cordi, scion of an 'ndrangheta family, was exiled for three years .

"They are more used to spending their nights out on the tiles. But prolific party-goer Kate Moss, fellow supermodel Naomi Campbell and rocker Noel Gallagher, 47, have agreed to stay in and watch TV for charity. The trio are taking part in a special celebrity Gogglebox sketch to raise money for Channel 4’s Stand Up To Cancer fundraiser. Scroll down for video . Kate Moss and fellow supermodel Naomi Campbell will be taking part in a special celebrity Gogglebox sketch . The hit reality TV series which launched in 2013 features a selection of families and couples watching television at home and commenting on the programmes they view together. Only on October 17 those watching the TV programmes selected and sharing their opinions with the viewers at home will be a little more glamorous. Moss normally refrains from commenting in public so for many viewers at home this will be the first time they will hear her speak. The supermodels will be joined by Noel Gallagher for Stand Up To Cancer fundraiser . The 40-year-old mother-of-one is said to have agreed to take part as she is a fan of the programme and enjoys watching Bake Off and X Factor and is also partial to the US sitcom Modern Family. Miss Campbell, 44, who will next star in US TV drama Empire is glued to American show Housewives of Atlanta. Last night a source said: ‘The sketch will help to raise money for charity and Kate is good friends with Noel and Naomi. When she knew she would have them by her side she did not hesitate to agree. ‘Kate likes watching TV and is a fan of Googlebox, Bake Off and X Factor.’ Moss and Campbell,who both grew up in London, have been firm friends since the 1990s as they flew around the world modelling and often found themselves working together. Describing their enduing friendship which has spanned 25 years, and providing an indication of what viewers can expect when they tune in to watch the sketch, Campbell has said in the past: ‘What’s Kate like? Well, she’s honest, loyal and straightforward. 'There’s no bullshit. She’s not pretentious in any way. What you see is what you get. I love that about her. After all, we’re both from south London — I’m from Streatham, she’s from Croydon — and from working-class families. She’s never tried to be anything else and nor have I. We know our roots.’ Moss and Gallagher became friends following the success of Oasis during the 1990s Britpop era. Googlebox launched on screens in 2013 and became the surprise hit of the year and has been equally as successful this year. The show regularly sets Twitter alight as viewers are bowled over with its depiction of ordinary folks and the dynamics of their relationships and family lives. The format has been sold all over the world, with American and Chinese broadcasters first in the queue to snap up the show.

"Normally all eyes on are on the politician's wives and their outfits during party conference season. But Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg was in the spotlight today after bizarrely wearing not one, but four different outfits in a single day. As he battled against claims the Lib Dems are indecisive and struggle commit to a course of action, he wore a suit for TV interviews, a smart casual outfit for a school visit and a black shirt and chinos for a Q&A session which looked more suited to the garden centre than the conference hall. He then switched back to his blue suit before the day was out. Embarking on a media blitz this morning, Nick Clegg (left) wore a dark blue suit, blue shirt and pink tie for his interviews on Sky News. Then on a visit to Castlehill Primary School in Glasgow, Mr Clegg wore jeans and a pale blue shirt (centre), but by this afternoon he was in grey chinos and a black shirt (right) Mr Clegg began the day with a media blitz of TV and radio interviews, appearing on BBC Radio Scotland, BBC Breakfast, 5Live, BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Sky News, Sky News Radio and ITV's Good Morning Britain. In all of the interviews he wore a dark blue suit, light blue shirt and a pink tie, despite listeners to radio shows being unable to see him. Barely an hour later he visited Castlehill Primary School in Bearsden, East Dunbartonshire, with his wife Miriam. To speak to the schoolchildren, Mr Clegg wore dark jeans, a light blue shirt and brown suede shoes. Aimed at promoting Lib Dem policies on childcare and school dinners, the couple tried their hand at making scones. Returning to the SECC conference centre on the Clyde, Mr Clegg took questions from Lib Dem activists in the main hall. But not before dipping into his wardrobe again, and pulling on a black shirt over a pair of light blue chinos. Mr Clegg had his suit on for appearances on ITV's Good Morning Britain (left) and even a radio interview on LBC (right). He was later spotted back in his suit at the end of the day . Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg today looked to wife Miriam for support as he warned his party has the 'fight of our lives' to survive at the next election . Mr Clegg and his wife Miriam visited Castehill Primary School in Glasgow to try their hand at making scones . The couple were all smiles as they chatted to pupils and were presented with a posie of Scottish thistles . There was much speculation that the Deputy Prime Minister was wearing jeans to address the party faithful, on what is a working day. But aides were quick to stress: 'They are chinos not jeans.' He was later spotted back in his suit at the end of the day . Earlier he teamed the ensemble with a brown sweater and bookish glasses while he waited for Vince Cable's keynote speech. The bizarre decision to dress down on a work day came as Mr Clegg warned his party they face the 'fight of our lives' to stay in power. The Lib Dem leader admitted his party faces a tough battle to cling to office after the general election in May, but insisted he would set out red lines for entering a new coalition with either the Tories or Labour. Asked if he would rather get into bed with David Cameron or Ed Miliband in a new power-sharing deal, Mr Clegg joked 'it's Miriam every single time'. Mid-afternoon Mr Clegg added a brown sweater to his ensemble as he waited for Vince Cable's keynote speech . No-one could quite understand why Mr Clegg chose to address delegates wearing a black shirt during a Q&A . During the Q&A session in the main hall of the SECC, Mr Clegg was asked about drugs, devolution, press regulation and arms sales . According to a poll published tonight, most voters, 56 per cent, believe the Lib Dems have become irrelevant. The ComRes survey for ITV News found just 26 per cent disagree. Just 14 per cent trust Mr Clegg to keep the promises he makes while 63 per cent believe the Lib Dem leader will break his pledges. Some 44 per cent of adults believe it was a mistake for the party to go into Coalition with the Conservatives in 2010 and 42 per cent feel betrayed by Nick Clegg. But ousting the Deputy Prime Minister and replacing him with a new leader would mean just 18 per cent are more likely to vote for the Liberal Democrats. Mr Clegg has come under pressure to spell out what his key demands would be before entering into a coalition with Labour or the Tories. But in keeping with the Lib Dem reputation for indecision, he insisted he would decide - but not yet. He said: 'Those are decisions and bridges, if you like, you can’t possibly cross until you hear what the bosses in all of this, the British people, have to say to us politicians in the ballot box at the next election.' Mr Clegg struck a casual pose on the main stage, in contrast to David Cameron and Ed Miliband's more formal looks at their party gatherings . The Lib Dem leader added: 'I really do think that if either Labour or the Conservatives were to run this country on their own again, the country would go backwards. It would go backwards economically under Labour, it would go backwards socially under Conservatives. 'I'm really pleased that we are the party saying that there's a more hopeful, positive vision of the future built around a simple old-fashioned liberal concept, which is opportunity for everybody.' A major split has opened up between the Tories and Lib Dems over how £25billion can be raised to eradicate the deficit after the election. Last week Tory Chancellor George Osborne made clear it should come entirely from spending cuts, including £3billion from freezing benefits. But Mr Clegg has insisted some of the money should come from tax rises. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'Our overall approach is that we want to maintain roughly what we have done in this government, which is that the bulk of the savings come from spending reductions, about 80 per cent but about 20 per cent come from tax increases.' On BBC Breakfast, Mr Clegg hinted that he would allow an in-out referendum on Britain's membership of the EU if he entered a new coalition with the Tories. 'We have said in law for the first time ever, if there is a change in the rules of the European Union, the so called treaties, powers are moved from Westminster and Whitehall to Brussels, there will be a referendum. 'I have gone even further than that, I have been saying for as long as I have been leader of this party, when that referendum takes place, the decision should be in or out. 'Our position is clear, there will be a referendum, we have guaranteed it in law, when the rules of the game change in the European Union and new things are asked of the United Kingdom and I believe that when that is held the question on the ballot paper should be in or out.' Appearing on Sky News Radio/IRN, Mr Clegg admitted to mistakes in the early days of the coalition, saying he disappeared into the 'boiler room' of government to make 'gory decisions' but failed to speak to the public about what he was doing. On the school visit this morning Nick Clegg's wife Miriam wore black trousers and a red print top, but for her husband's Q&A she wore a beige dress and bright orange shoes . In an apparent show of solidarity, Mrs Clegg's striking footwear matched the Lib Dems' official colours . Nick Clegg's wife Miriam sported two looks today, wearing black trousers and a red print top to Castehill Primary School in Glasgow this morning, before changing for her husband's Q&A into a beige dress and bright orange shoes.

"Furious: Russian Natalia Pereverzeva stunned judges and her countrymen by launching a furious tirade at the state of her country during a beauty pageant .

Astonishing Natalia Pereverzeva was competing in the Miss Earth competition, an event similar to Miss Universe and other pageants but with a twist - competitors are expected to be both gorgeous and environmentally aware. When Natalia, 24  was asked a question about what makes her proud of her country, she initially used glowing, if slightly odd, words about her homeland, according to Radio Free Europe. She said: 'My Russia, it is bright, warm, patched, but it is so pleasant to slumber under it on a winter evening when the storm rages outside. 'My Russia, it is a kind cow with very big eyes, funny horns and always chewing its mouth oh, what sweet milk she gives! Oh, how it smells -- meadow herbs and the sun.' But then she suddenly and angrily rails against widespread corruption in the troubled nation. 'But my Russia -- it is also my poor, long-suffering country, mercilessly torn to pieces by greedy, dishonest, unbelieving people,' she said. 'My Russia, it is a great artery, from which the 'chosen' few people draining away its wealth. My Russia is a beggar. 'My Russia cannot help her elderly and orphans. From it, bleeding, like from a sinking ship, engineers, doctors, teachers are fleeing, because they have nothing to live on.

"The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday blocked key parts of a 2013 law in Texas that had closed all but eight facilities providing abortions in America's second most-populous state. In an unsigned order, the justices sided with abortion rights advocates and health care providers in suspending an Oct. 2 ruling by a panel of the New Orleans-based U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals that Texas could immediately apply a rule making abortion clinics statewide spend millions of dollars on hospital-level upgrades. The court also put on hold a provision of the law only as it applies to clinics in McAllen and El Paso that requires doctors at the facilities to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. The admitting privileges rule remains in effect elsewhere in Texas. Thwarted: The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday blocked key parts of a 2013 law in Texas that had closed all but eight facilities providing abortions . Protesters on both sides of the abortion debate appeared in Austin, Texas in July 2013 (file photo) Justices Samuel Alito, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas said they would have ruled against the clinics in all respects. The 5th Circuit is still considering the overall constitutionality of the sweeping measure overwhelmingly passed by the GOP-controlled Texas Legislature and signed into law by Gov. Rick Perry last year. Even as it weighs the merits of the law, the appeals court had said it could be enforced - opening the door for the emergency appeal to the Supreme Court. 'We're seeing the terrible impact these restrictions have on thousands of Texas women who effectively no longer have access to safe and legal abortion,' said Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America. 'We're relieved that the court stepped in to stop this, and we hope this dangerous law is ultimately overturned completely.' Abortion opponents predicted they will ultimately prevail. 'This does not protect the health and safety of women who are undergoing abortion,' said Joe Pojman, executive director of Texas Alliance for Life. 'This is definitely a short-term loss, but not necessarily a long- term loss.' The fight over the Texas law is the latest over tough new abortion restrictions that have been enacted across the country (file photo) Stopped: The justices suspended an appeals court ruling that Texas could immediately apply a rule making abortion clinics statewide spend millions of dollars on hospital-level upgrades (file photo) The 5th Circuit decision had blocked an August ruling by Austin-based U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel, who had found that requiring hospital-style upgrades was less about safety than making access to abortion difficult. Yeakel's ruling temporarily suspended the upgrade rules before they could go into effect Sept. 1 - and the order from the Supreme Court means they are on hold again. Allowing the rules on hospital-level upgrades to be enforced - including mandatory operating rooms and air filtration systems - shuttered more than a dozen clinics across Texas. Until the nation's highest court intervened, only abortion facilities in the Houston, Austin, San Antonio and the Dallas-Fort Worth areas remained open. And none was left along the Texas-Mexico border or outside any of the state's largest urban areas. Some other clinics had closed even earlier amid enforcement of the rule on admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. That portion has already been upheld twice by the appeals court. The court also put on hold a provision of the law only as it applies to clinics in McAllen and El Paso that requires doctors at the facilities to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals (file photo) The fight over the Texas law is the latest over tough new abortion restrictions that have been enacted across the country. The office of Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, a Republican who is the favorite in next month's governor's race, is leading the defense of the law. Democrat Wendy Davis launched her campaign for governor behind the celebrity she achieved through a nearly 13-hour filibuster last summer that temporarily blocked the law's passage. Davis said she was 'thankful that women can continue to make their own personal decisions.' Abbott's office said he would continue to defend the law. Attorneys for the state have denied that Texas women would be burdened by fewer abortion facilities, saying nearly 9 in 10 would still live within 150 miles of a provider. The law's opponents note that leaves nearly a million Texas women embarking on drives longer than three hours to get an abortion. Hilltop Women's Reproductive Services in El Paso has been referring women who want abortions to another clinic it owns in New Mexico. Gloria Martinez, Hilltop's administrative nurse, said she would call state officials Wednesday before deciding whether the clinic will resume performing abortions.","The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday blocked key parts of a 2013 law in Texas that had closed all but eight facilities .

"Gunfire echoes across the desert plain as a Kurdish army commander, crouched on a dusty ridge, takes his finger off  his AK-47 trigger and lifts his binoculars. ‘They’re definitely getting closer,’ announces Shehab Ahmed Hamed a few moments later in a theatrical whisper. By ‘they’ he meant the Islamic State militants fighting Kurdish armed forces, or Peshmerga, only a mile and a half away in the village of Shovepelke. Thankfully we could only hear their guns, not see them, though that was scant comfort. ‘We need your British warplanes more than ever now,’ said Shehab after a long sigh. Scroll down for video . Thin line of defence: Fighters beneath the Kurdish flag near Makhmour . We didn’t know it at the time – it was late yesterday morning – but as he spoke two RAF Tornadoes carrying laser-guided bombs were already flying over Northern Iraq, prepared to strike at IS targets. Here in northern Iraq, on the frontline in the battle against IS, British assistance – any assistance from above, in fact – would indeed be most welcome. Behind us, at the foot of the Karajokh mountains, the fearful Kurdish town  of Makhmour shimmered in the distance. Its people feel trapped, surrounded – and very scared. Makhmour fell to the Islamists a month ago, only to be reclaimed by  the Peshmerga a few days later. But there are increasing concerns that without the support of coalition jets, it may fall again soon. ‘Please tell David Cameron that IS are all around us,’ says 22-year-old Marwa Fazil, who returned home yesterday after fleeing in terror last month with her children, aged two and three. Her husband stayed to fight with the Peshmerga. There was, she recalls, ‘a sick feeling of dread in my stomach’ when the ominous black flags of IS were raised across the town, when its terrorists swept from house to house, pillaging and killing and burning down shops. Bullet holes scar the walls of buildings, broken glass still carpets the pavements. ‘It keeps returning, that feeling. I don’t know how long it will be safe here,’ says Marwa. ‘We all fear them coming back and I am terrified something will happen to  my children.’ Enemy camp: Image from an IS video said to show recruits preparing for jihad . All over the town, David Cameron’s name is invoked with an almost strange frequency by both young and old. They whooped with joy, they said, when the Commons voted in favour of air strikes. ‘We keep a close eye on what goes on in UK,’ explained Shehab later, a patterned scarf hung around his waist in traditional Kurdish fashion. ‘We have to. What is decided in your country can make the difference between life and death here.’ As if suddenly embarrassed by this melodramatic flourish, he quickly laughed. ‘Of course, we know the names of Manchester United’s new signings too.’ Makhmour, with a population of around 6,000, is 30 miles from the city of Erbil, the oil-rich capital of Iraqi Kurdistan, which IS has coveted for months. Buoyed by the capture of Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city, the jihadists managed to reach Erbil’s margins in the summer, but were repelled. ‘They want to take Makhmour again because it is the last place before Erbil,’ said another Peshmerga fighter, Idres Salem Muamed. ‘It is strategically important to them.’ Directly opposite the cafe in the centre of the town, where Idres sat drinking tea with other Peshmerga soldiers yesterday morning, were the burnt remains of an electrical goods store. ‘They [Islamic State] did this when they were here; they burnt down a lot of our houses and shops,’ said Idres. ‘Near here they killed a child, a boy, who was fleeing with his mother and father. We knew they were coming. We could see the black flags flying from their cars. We evacuated all the women and children – most went to the mountains – but there was not enough Peshmerga to fight back. Strong holds: The green lines show the increasing hold IS has over the region . ‘So we had to retreat and regroup and then we came back after a few days in greater numbers – 600 of us in  all from all over the region. The Islamists  soon took flight.’ It is only now that the women and children are beginning to drift back and many, like Marwa, already wish they hadn’t. In their absence the men of the town, ranging in age from 17 to 70, took up arms. Few had any military experience. They are a volunteer army ready to fight alongside the Peshmerga. Three miles away the front line is formed of mounds of earth. At the point where Shehab watched and waited yesterday, there was a cluster of tents, some plastic chairs and the Kurdish flag atop a pole that kept threatening to keel over. In all, it isn’t much of a bulwark against marauding terrorists. ‘But it’s the best we’ve got at the moment’, said Shehab. Alternately peering through his binoculars and aiming his gun, Shehab said fighting was raging ‘beyond the clump of trees in the far distance’. He added: ‘This morning the IS took control of Shovepelka and another settlement, Hoshtralok, which is nearby. But the Peshmerga has now moved in and there is fighting from close quarters. It has been going on since nine o’clock this morning.’ 'It is vital that Britain get involved because it gives legitimacy to our war. It means it is not just the US and a few others, but Europe to' As well as help from above, the soldiers beseech the UK to ‘send us weapons’. In Makhmour, at least, they possess only archaic rifles and ‘not enough semi-automatics’. In comparison, the IS terrorists’ arsenal is sophisticated, much of it the latest hardware from the United States. At the Peshmerga’s regional HQ, a few miles down the dusty desert road to Erbil, it is this subject that senior commander Najdt Ali Salin is constantly turning over in his mind. ‘Air strikes alone are not enough,’ he said. ‘We don’t need soldiers from Britain and America but we do need some of the marvellous weapons you have in the UK. ‘The air strikes have helped us a great deal, allowed us to recapture lost land, towns and villages. We need more, though, to strengthen our positions around Makhmour and push them [IS] further back. ‘It is vital that Britain gets involved because it gives legitimacy to our war. It means it is not just the US and a few others, but Europe too. ‘But more sophisticated weapons, are essential if we are to win this war. I do not wish to be ungrateful, I was delighted to hear the news about your Parliament’s vote.’ Elsewhere in the HQ, which was occupied briefly by IS, a less senior soldier boasted about recent successes. ‘We have killed 47 IS militants in villages around here in the past week, ‘ he said as he flourished his mobile phone, full of pictures of dead bodies. Back at the front line, Shahab had tilted his binoculars upwards and was scanning the skies. There was still no news about Britain’s Tornados – which did not, in fact, strike at IS targets yesterday. ‘They may be further north around Mosul,’ he said. ‘Never mind. Perhaps next time for us.’","In Iraq they 'whooped with joy' that the Commons backed air strikes .

"Afghanistan swore in Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai as its second elected president on Monday, embarking on a new era with a national unity government poised to confront a resilient Taliban insurgency by signing an agreement with the United States that would guarantee a continuing American military presence. As Hamid Karzai left the political stage, the new president was locked into an uneasy partnership with his defeated rival, Abdullah Abdullah, who became the country's first chief executive. With a hug for the cameras, both sides appeared determined to reach across factions and avoid a descent into an abyss similar to what has happened in Iraq, where the government's failure to mend lingering sectarian divisions following a full U.S. withdrawal helped give rise to the brutal Islamic State group. Scroll down for videos . Ceremony: Afghanistan's new President Ashraf Ghani (centre) arrives for inauguration as president in Kabul . Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai is expected to sign an agreement with the United States that would guarantee a continuing American military presence . John Podesta (pictured), a senior adviser to President Obama, said that the new Afghan government was expected Tuesday to sign the agreement . John Podesta, a senior adviser to President Obama, said that the new Afghan government was expected Tuesday to sign a security agreement that provides a legal framework for the United States to keep about 9,800 troops in the country to train, advise and assist Afghan national security forces after the current international combat mission ends on December 31. That number of troops is expected to be cut in half by the end of 2015, and the U.S. would leave only about 1,000 in a security office after the end of 2016. Karzai, the outgoing president, had refused to approve the deal, which is intended to help Afghan security forces combat the resilient Taliban insurgency. The Afghan government also is expected to sign an agreement this week with Nato that would outline the parameters of 4,000 to 5,000 additional international troops - mostly from Britain, Germany, Italy and Turkey - to stay in Afghanistan in a noncombat role after the end of this year. Without a post-2014 residual force, U.S. military officials say there is a risk that the Afghan security force will deteriorate, units would run out of fuel, pay systems would fail and there would be a reduction in the overall readiness of the Afghan police and army. Swearing in: At a handover ceremony in the country's capital Kabul this morning, Ashraf Ghani (centre left) was formally named president. The event marked Afghanistan's first ever democratic transfer of power . They say al-Qaeda is in 'survival mode' in Afghanistan, but that if all international forces left this year, the terrorist network would see it as a victory, regroup and again use the region to plan and conduct operations against the West. But there are serious questions about the ability of the Afghan security forces to take on the militants, even with a residual U.S. force - down from a high of more than 130,000 U.S. and Nato troops in Afghanistan several years ago. 'Afghanistan doesn't have the full military necessary to defend the country,' said Mohammad Doud Kalakani, a member of the Afghan parliament. 'No air force, no tanks, limited artillery.' U.S. House Armed Services Committee Chairman Rep. Howard 'Buck' McKeon, R-Calif., said Monday that he hoped President Barack Obama will view the signing of the security agreement as a 'roadmap for a robust continued engagement, and not a path to premature withdrawal.' Setting aside rivalries: Moments after Ghani took the presidential oath, he swore in his election challenger, Abdullah Abdullah (centre) as chief executive . McKeon also wants the administration to rethink its plans to draw down U.S. forces. 'We are witnessing now in Iraq what happens when the U.S. falters on that commitment and adopts a posture inconsistent with our security interests,' McKeon said. U.S.-Afghan relations will likely improve under Ghani Ahmadzai, a 65-year-old numbers-based technocrat who worked at the World Bank. Karzai, the country's only leader since the 2001 U.S.-led invasion, frequently criticized the U.S. government and irritated American leaders with his mercurial behavior; Karzai was criticized in turn for his inability or unwillingness to tackle corruption in his own government. On Monday, however, Karzai wore a wide smile as he greeted his presidential guards upon entering the palace, where he presided over the first peaceful transfer of power in the nation's history. It was made possible by a constitution that he helped draft and that prohibited him from serving a third five-year term. Ghani Ahmadzai's first act in office was to swear in Abdullah as chief executive, a role that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry helped create to give voice to both Afghanistan's northern and southern flanks of power. Outgoing: Afghanistan's former president Hamid Karzai arrives for the inauguration of the country's new president at a ceremony in Kabul this morning . 'Afghans have taken a moment of challenge and turned it into a moment of real opportunity,' Kerry said Monday in a statement congratulating both men. The deal settled months of political tensions that threatened to push the fragile country into civil war. But it remains to be seen how well the two Afghan leaders will work together, and whether the agreement will last. They still must agree on Cabinet appointments. The nearly six-month-long election was marred by allegations of massive vote fraud, a staple of Afghanistan's last two presidential votes. Ghani Ahmadzai won a June runoff with 55 per cent of votes cast, according to official results, though one million votes were thrown out. Abdullah's coalition continues to believe the election was stolen but accepted the chief executive compromise to avoid violence. Bloodshed may be in Afghanistan's future anyway. Taliban militants this summer - for the first time since attacks truly picked up in 2005 - fought Afghan Army troops instead of the powerful U.S. and Nato military machine. The Afghan army saw its fatality rate skyrocket and the Taliban make gains. Ghani Ahmadzai has said he would also welcome talks with the Taliban, who control vast rural sections of southern and eastern Afghanistan. 'We are tired of war,' he said in his inauguration speech. 'Our message is peace, (but) this doesn't mean we are weak.' Peace did not prevail on Monday, according to police reports. A suicide bomber detonated explosives at an intersection that leads to Kabul's airport, killing a half dozen people. A bigger attack took place in eastern Paktia province, where a car bomb and gunfire attack by militants sparked a battle that killed seven Taliban fighters, four police officers and two civilians. The dual attacks served as a reminder that Taliban violence remains a part of daily life despite the deaths of more than 2,000 U.S. service members in Afghanistan since the 2001 invasion that toppled the Taliban regime for harboring al-Qaeda militants responsible for 9/11. 'I hope Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai can bring peace and the rule of law in Afghanistan as former Afghan President Hamid Karzai could not bring peace,' said Abdul Rahman, a 30-year-old police officer. 'Our people have been suffering from the instability and poverty.' The new president made pledges sure to please not only the international community but many Afghans as well. Ghani Ahmadzai said that women will play a prominent role in government and that corruption will be tackled. He introduced his wife to the country, a sharp contrast to Karzai's wife, who almost never appeared in public. Ghani Ahmadzai wore a dark black turban popular in the country's south as he swore in his two vice presidents and then Abdullah and his deputies. Abdullah, a former foreign minister, spoke first and thanked Karzai for his service and the people of the country for casting votes in the millions despite threats by Taliban militants. 'We are committed as one in the national unity government,' Abdullah said. 'Our commitment will be fulfilled together as a unified team to create national unity.' Ghani Ahmadzai then congratulated Karzai for a peaceful and democratic transition of power, and he thanked Abdullah for making the national unity government possible. 'We want to be held accountable. I am your leader but I am no better than you. If I make mistakes, you should hold me accountable,' Ghani Ahmadzai said. Though Kerry played a big role in reaching the deal, he did not attend the inauguration. Only one world leader was in attendance: Pakistani President Mamnoon Hussain. Karzai, who has cautioned the successor government about its future dealings with the U.S., took a bold swipe at the U.S. during his farewell address last week. 'They should take a careful path with America and the West,' Karzai said. The U.S. has invested $104billion in Afghanistan since 2001 to train and equip the country's security forces, pave roads, upgrade hospitals, build schools and help modernize the nation, but the United States was omitted from a list of countries Karzai thanked in his speech. The U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, James Cunningham, said Karzai's remarks were ungrateful and not representative of widespread Afghan public opinion. In his statement, however, Kerry paid tribute to Karzai, who inherited a broken country when the Americans and their allies chose him more than a decade ago as a leader they hoped could cross ethnic lines, embrace former enemies and bring Afghans together. 'It's no secret that our relationship with President Karzai has been punctuated by disagreements,' Kerry said. But 'he is a nationalist, a patriot, and an important figure who stepped forward when his country needed him, and helped profoundly shape one of the most challenging periods in Afghan history that has seen remarkable progress.'","Afghanistan swore in Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai as its second elected president .

"Animal patrol officers were forced to shoot a giant black bear with a large tranquiliser dart after spending an afternoon climbing trees. Residents in Ridgewood, New Jersey awoke to find the large animal clambering through the neighbourhood. At one stage, officials wanted news organisations with helicopters to 'buzz' the large beast to force him from the tree. Scroll down for video .

"A 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' sequel will premiere on Netflix the same day it's out in theaters - in what could be a massive shift for the way we watch cinema. 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: The Green Legend' - a sequel to the Academy-award-winning martial arts film released in 2000 - will hit screens big and small on August 28, 2015. In the first deal of its kind, the Weinstein Company, which is chaired by Bob and Harvey Weinstein, will produce the film for Netflix and IMAX cinemas. It will not appear in other movie theaters. Netflix hopes the deal will show Hollywood that the time has come for a new model for releasing films. Success! Netflix has scored a victory after securing a deal so subscribers can stream the 'Crouching Tiger' sequel next year on the same day it comes out in theaters. Pictured, co-founder Marc Randolph last week . It will cost Netflix subscribers nothing extra to view the new release next year. A subscription to the service costs $8.99 a month. 'The moviegoing experience is evolving quickly and profoundly, and Netflix is unquestionably at the forefront of that movement,' Harvey Weinstein said in a statement, CNN reported. The companies said in a statement that the deal will give 'consumers and exhibitors around the world unparalleled flexibility in how, when and where they enjoy a major motion picture'. The companies have not released the financial details of the deal. No other studios, including Warner Bros. or 20th Century Fox, have yet expressed an interest in running premieres in homes and in cinemas simultaneously, CNN reported. New model: The first 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' (pictured) earned more than $210 million worldwide and it has yet to be seen how releasing its sequel on Netflix will affect cinema sales and relationships . There are fears that a similar deal could sully relationships with theaters such as AMC and Regal Entertainment, which rely on ticket sales to stay in business. Under current contracts, theaters - Regal Entertainment, AMC Entertainment and Cinemark - get to show movies for three months without competition. the New York Times reported. Yet Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos said he hoped that their partnership with the Weinsteins would encourage others to get behind the new model. 'What I am hoping is that it will be a proof point that the sky doesn't fall,' Sarandos told the New York Times. 'These are two different experiences, like going to a football game and watching a football game on TV.' Netflix has long said the model of screening films before they hit the small screen is old-fashioned. Getting in on the action: The Weinstein Company, which is chaired by Bob and Harvey Weinstein (pictured), is producing the 'Crouching Tiger' sequel for Netflix and in IMAX cinemas . 'By the time we could watch a movie in the subscription window, it's a year after it's been in the theater,' Sarandos told CNN in an earlier interview. The company has so far had success with creating their own content, such as Orange is the New Black - and Sarandos suggested they might move this way for film, too. How the simultaneous release will affect earnings at the box office is yet to be determined. The first 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' earned more than $210 million worldwide, and it ranks as the best-selling Chinese language film in domestic box office history.","'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: The Green Legend' will be available to watch on Netflix and in IMAX theaters on August 28, 2015 .

"A stroke victim is hoping to smile for the first time in 10 years - with the help of transplanted muscles from her forehead. Sara McKay, 45, suffered a  stroke, leading doctors to diagnose a life-threatening brain tumour. The mother-of-two from Consett in County Durham, has spent years learning to walk and talk again. She lost the ability to smile after the left side of her face was paralysed. Now she has undergone an operation at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary, where surgeons removed muscles from her forehead and replanted them into her left cheek, in an effort to bring some movement back to her face. Sara McKay, 45, from Consett in County Durham has just undergone an operation which could help her smile again, after a stroke and a brain tumour left her paralysed and without movement on the left side of her face. She says her husband George, 43, has been her 'lifeline' Mrs McKay said: 'Hopefully this will try to help my mouth to move, meaning that I can fully smile again. I knew if I didn't get it done, I would always regret it. 'I'm now waiting to see if the operation's been successful; they said it could take a little while.' As her husband George, 43, is in the army, Mrs McKay was living in barracks in Germany when she first fell ill in 2004. She said: 'George was in the Scots Guards and we were living in Munster with our two children. 'In June 2004 I had a stroke and, when tests were carried out, they discovered a brain tumour on my brain stem. 'By the following year the tumour had started to grow and suddenly I was in a 'live or die' situation. 'There was no option but to have an operation to remove it. 'I'd lost all movement down one side and, following the operation, I had to learn how to walk and speak all over again.' Throughout her illness, Mrs McKay said husband George became her lifeline. 'He was always there for me,' she said. 'If it hadn't been for him I don't know how we would have got through everything.' The couple returned from Germany in 2008 and Mrs McKay is continuing with her rehabilitation. Determined not to be beaten, she now goes to the gym and can walk with the help of a stick. Mrs McKay's condition also left her with facial palsy, meaning the left side of her face was paralysed. Surgeons at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle removed muscles from the top of Mrs McKay's forehead and planted them in her cheek in the hope of allowing her to smile . It prevents her mouth from moving on one side, but she has always hoped that one day she would be able to smile again. Finally, this summer surgeons at the RVI removed muscles from the top of her head and planted them in her cheek in the hope of allowing her to smile. She is now waiting to see if the operation will work, and is coping with the help of her husband and two children Samantha, 21, and Robert, 19. Her daughter Samantha said: 'My mum has been through so many operations but always came back fighting strong. 'Dad looked after me and my brother, as well as being deployed to Iraq. They are both my heroes and I'm so proud to call them my parents.'","Sara McKay, 45, suffered a paralysing stroke caused by a brain tumour .

"Ofcom chief executive Ed Richards will step down from his £393,000-a-year job at the end of the year, he announced yesterday. The former adviser to Tony Blair, who applied unsuccessfully to lead the BBC in 2012, said it was ‘the right time to move on’ after eight years at the helm of the broadcasting regulator. Mr Richards, 49, has not lined up another job and will not be able to work for another organisation in the broadcasting or telecoms sector for 12-months after his departure without the approval of Ofcom’s chairman Dame Patricia Hodgson, to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. Stepping down: Ofcom chief executive Ed Richards will step down from his £393,000-a-year job at the end of the year, he announced yesterday . During Mr Richards’ tenure, Ofcom has repeatedly been accused of being too lenient on broadcasters who upset viewers with lewd or violent programmes. Last year, campaigners said the regulator was ‘out of touch’ after it failed to take action over a string of controversies. Simon Cowell’s shows The X Factor and Britain’s Got Talent have repeatedly been cleared by Ofcom despite attracting hundreds of complaints. In October last year, The X Factor results show sparked 317 complaints when singer Lady Gaga stripped to her underwear before the watershed and posed suggestively. Controversy: In October last year, The X Factor results show sparked 317 complaints when singer Lady Gaga stripped to her underwear before the watershed and posed suggestively . Cleared: Ofcom also cleared a BBC Comic Relief broadcast, in which Rowan Atkinson dressed as the Archbishop of Canterbury and gave a fireside homily in which he exhorted viewers not to 's*** your neighbour' Even though the episode was watched by nearly a million children and prompted fury from campaigners, Ofcom decided not to investigate, saying it had not broken its broadcasting code. The same year, it also cleared an offensive BBC Comic Relief broadcast, in which comic Rowan Atkinson dressed as Church of England leader Justin Welby and gave a fake fireside homily in which he exhorted viewers not to ‘s*** your neighbour’ and to ‘give us your bloomin’ wonga’. Ofcom have now hired headhunters Zygos to find a replacement. Culture Secretary Sajid Javid must approve the candidate. Approval needed: Culture Secretary Sajid Javid (pictured) must approve Mr Richards's replacement . Mr Richards’ departure comes at a significant time ahead of the 2015 general election and doubts about the governance of the BBC, which Ofcom does not regulate at present. The Conservative Party warned it would curb Ofcom’s power before the 2010 general election, but Mr Richards appeased some critics by slashing its operating costs by a third. During his tenure as Ofcom chief executive, he was involved in the row over Rupert Murdoch’s abortive bid to buy all of BskyB and claimed to have pushed down broadband and phone call prices. But he was criticised by some for his huge pay package, which included a £284,000 salary, a £30,000 bonus, plus a generous pension and other benefits. The announcement came as his partner, Delyth Evans, steps up her campaign to become a Labour MP at the forthcoming election. A former Welsh Assembly member, Miss Evans stood down as chief executive of the charity Dress for Success earlier this year to become candidate for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire. Yesterday, Mr Richards said: ‘It has been a privilege to lead Ofcom during such an exciting and dynamic period in the evolution of the UK’s communications sector. ‘It is never easy leaving a job that you enjoy greatly but I have always felt that once I had completed eight years as chief executive this would be the right time to move on.’ In 2012, Mr Richards applied to replace Mark Thompson as director general of the BBC. He missed out to George Entwistle, who resigned after just 54 days following the Jimmy Savile and Lord McAlpine Newsnight scandals. Dame Hodgson said: ‘Ed has been an outstanding chief executive. Under his leadership, Ofcom has helped to deliver superfast broadband, 4G, lower prices, innovation, competition, and sustainable public service broadcasting in the UK. He leaves an impressive legacy. On behalf of the board I would like to thank him for his enormous contribution.’ A spokesman for Ofcom said: 'When broadcasters break the rules, we take robust action to protect audiences, and we continuously monitor audience attitudes to ensure our regulations are in line with people’s expectations. 'Ofcom has fined broadcasters more than £15m in the past decade.’","Ed Richards will step down from his £393,000-a-year job in December .

"David Moyes was escorted into Borussia Monchengladbach's stadium by Toni Kroos' agent on Friday night after being alerted to a contract stand-off between the Germany midfielder and his Bayern Munich bosses. Bayern striker Mario Mandzukic and Monchengladbach midfielder Patrick Herrmann were believed to be the two main points of interest for the Manchester United manager when he booked his seat at Borussia Park for the Bundesliga fixture, which the visitors won 2-0. But while both are under review at Old Trafford, Kroos has dramatically emerged as a viable target after his representative Sascha Breese, from the Sports Total agency, met Moyes and coaches Phil Neville and Steve Round and sat with them at the game. Hard worker: Manchester United manager David Moyes with Toni Kroos' agent (right) in Germany . Toni Kroos is just 24 but already has 41 appearances for Germany under his belt. Joining as a youngster from Hansa Rostock in 2006, Kroos has flourished into a pass master in Bayern Munich's star-studded midfield. Alongside Bastian Schweinsteiger, Javi Martinez, Thiago or any of Bayern's other superstars, Kroos can pull the strings, drifting into the space behind the forward-thinking Thomas Muller, Mario Mandzukic, Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery. Fans of Manchester City won't remember Kroos's last visit to England too fondly, when he played all 90 minuted of the humbling 3-1 Champions League win at the Etihad earlier this season. Kroos was also instrumental when Bayern performed a similar feat against Arsenal last campaign. He bagged the first goal in the 3-1 win at the Emirates Stadium. At 24 and with a stack of Germany caps to his name, Kroos is a perfect fit for the area of United's team in most urgent need of improvement, and the Germany midfielder could be prised away after stalling over a new deal at the Allianz Arena. His current deal runs out at the end of next season, and Bayern chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge admitted: 'It is always about money in every agreement, and talks have so far failed to lead to a new contract for Toni. We are interested in prolonging his stay with us.' Bayern would doubtless ask at least £25million for Kroos, but United have illustrated their willingness to spend big by agreeing a £37m fee for Chelsea's Juan Mata. Bayern are also hoping to open contract talks with Mandzukic, but United will be heartened by news of a fall-out between the free-scoring striker and coach Pep Guardiola. Mandzukic, whose contract runs until 2016, was evidently accused of lacking enthusiasm in training and axed from the squad for Friday night's game. ‘Mandzukic could pack his bags,' said club legend Franz . Beckenbauer. 'I see Lewandowski in . the attack, his playing style is suited for (Pep) Guardiola's ideas . than that of Manduzkic. ‘There . are even more reasons why he could leave - even without him, Guardiola . could still count on Thomas Muller and Mario Gotze in attack.’ Raconteur?

Monchengladbach striker Max Kruse (left) is interesting United but Bayern's Dante (right) isn't . Significant lead: Bayern Munich's victory took them 10 points clear at the top of the Bundesliga . The goalscorers: Thomas Muller (right) and Mario Gotze (second left) were again key for Bayern . As for the match itself, Muller set up . one goal and scored a penalty to help the Bundesliga leaders go 10 points clear as the league . resumed after the winter break. Despite . the absence of key players, including the injured Franck Ribery and . Bastian Schweinsteiger, Bayern picked up where they left . off in December to stretch their unbeaten run to 42 consecutive league . games. After a nervous . opening spell in which third-placed Gladbach squandered a . golden chance, Bayern, who have now won their last nine league games, . settled and came close when Gotze's shot scraped the post. Gotze started in a lone striker role after Mario Mandzukic was dropped . from the squad for not having trained well, according to sports . director Matthias Sammer. He . soon had better luck when Muller raced down the right wing and cut the . ball back for his Germany team mate to drill into the net for the lead . after seven minutes. Gladbach . were constantly on the backfoot against a Bayern side who never hit top . speed but controlled possession, using defender Philipp Lahm as a . holding midfielder while Spaniard Thiago orchestrated the game. The . hosts did come close twice on the stroke of half-time with Bayern . goalkeeper Manuel Neuer palming a Kruse shot on to the post and denying . Juan Arango from close range.

"A father who suffered a horrific car accident while working for multinational company Kellogg’s has revealed how they terminated his employment via email when he wasn't well enough  to get back to his job soon enough. Scott McAtamney, from Rockhampton, had been working as a sales rep for the food company in Queensland for seven years and was on his way to set up a sales display when his car was reportedly hit by another driver in January 2013. ‘For a company as big as Kellogg’s, I carried my name on their shirt for seven years and they gave me the least amount of money they possibly could,’ Mr McAtamney told Daily Mail Australia. ‘I just couldn’t fathom what I’ve done for them to sack me by email,’ he added. ‘What really hurt me is I left work for something that wasn’t my fault.’ Scott McAtamney suffered over 10 broken bones and brain damage during a car accident in January 2013 . The father of two has now been fired from his job as a sales rep at Kellogg's . During the accident, his white Ford Mondeo smashed into a tree as it flew off the road and left Scott with life threatening injuries. The 41-year-old suffered brain damage, a collapsed lung, and a broken back, along with a broken shoulder bone, wrist, ankles and five smashed ribs. Since the devastating crash he has developed post-traumatic stress disorder and has seen the return of his epilepsy, triggered by the brain damage. ‘The pain is ongoing but at the end of the day I am lucky to be sitting here now. I’m scared about what it’s going to be like later on in life… I’ve got two beautiful kids so I look at them to be OK,’ he said while describing his agonising pain. The driver who clipped him didn’t stop and was never identified. The father-of-two explained that he found out too late past the legal claims period that he could have claimed compensation from third party insurance. Since the devastating crash he has developed post-traumatic stress disorder . Mr McAtamney’s wife is also an on the road sales rep and he now worries for her own safety every time she leaves for work. ‘I give her a kiss and hope she drives safely. I just think every day “what if she doesn’t come home” though,’ he explained. The sacked salesmen tried to go back to work - despite doctor’s advice that it was too soon - and felt panicked on the roads every time a car came past. He’s been seeing a psychiatrist and a neurologist over the past 12 months but ‘doesn’t even like driving to the corner shop’ now. ‘I went back to work before I should have because I needed the company car. It was six months after the crash and I was doing restricted hours… but the doctors said it was doing more harm than good for my post-traumatic stress,’ Mr McAtamney said. Mr McAtamney says looking at his children has helped him to stay positive . Since the accident Mr McAtamney 'doesn't even like driving to the corner shop now' Mr McAtamney's wife is also a sales rep and has to drive a lot for her job, which worries him . The dad can no longer afford to send his daughter to day care and looks after her at home . It was then that Kellogg’s said they would ‘probably have to’ let him go. Mr McAtamney admits that Kellogg’s haven’t done anything wrong legally but he is angry about how they handled his termination. ‘At this stage I’m just that angry and my heads screwed up… there are days when I won’t even answer my phone to my mates. ‘I’m not trying to play the violin and get people to feel sorry for me… I’m angry that I gave them 110 per cent for seven years and they go on about “K Values” but I was treated like this,’ he said. Mr McAtamney received four weeks’ pay from Kellogg’s and 'any remaining annual leave entitlements' when his employment was terminated by email on October 8. During the accident his car smashed into a tree as it flew off the road and left Scott with life threatening injuries . His white Ford Mondeo was destroyed during the accident . The 41-year-old's lung collapsed during the accident and he was forced to a have blood transfusion . Mr McAtamney received an email from Kellogg's on October 2 informing him that he would be losing his job . In the email, seen by Daily Mail Australia, Kellogg's says: 'This letter confirms your employment has been terminated effective on 8 October 2014 on medical grounds.' It goes on to say that Kellogg's does not 'agree' with his views 'regarding the company's responsibility arising from the car accident'. Mr McAtamney said with a $300,000 mortgage to pay, he has been forced to pull his daughter out of childcare. Meanwhile, WorkCover Queensland are covering 75 per cent of his former wage until he can find a new job if and when he is fit enough to work again. A Kellogg spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: 'This was a complicated issue as a valued staff member had suffered terrible injuries in a car accident almost 18 months ago.' 'The company has been working with Scott in this period and we believe we have taken a reasonable and considered approach. 'Over the past 18 months, Kellogg had facilitated Scott’s return to his role with reduced responsibilities and working hours. As soon as Scott was able to drive again, a replacement vehicle was provided to him. 'In the interim, Kellogg had organised a hire car for his use. Due to his health, Scott was unable to continue work, and it’s highly unlikely he’ll be able to return to work anytime soon. 'With this in mind, Kellogg had made the difficult decision to end Scott’s employment. WorkCover is continuing to provide Scott with support, which includes medical and financial support, as well as re-training options,' the spokesperson explained. Kellogg's paid Mr McAtamney full time workers compensation following the accident and when he returned to work in a reduced capacity, he was paid a salary as well as his workers compensation payment.","Scott McAtamney was working as a sales rep for Kellogg's for seven years .

"America's largest anti-sexual assault organization is slamming Maroon 5 and Adam Levine for what they are calling a 'dangerous' new music video. The video, for the group's new single, Animals, follows Levine, 35, as he stalks, unknowingly photographs and ultimately sexually assaults a woman as the two are covered in blood. The woman is played by none other than Levine's real-life wife, South African-born Victoria's Secret model Behati Prinsloo. Scroll down for video . Too far? Adam Levine and Maroon 5 are being slammed by an anti-sexual assault organization over their music video for their new single Animals . Bad premise: In the video, Levine plays a butcher who stalks, unknowingly photographs and then sexually assaults a woman . Casting couch: The woman in the video is played by Levine's wife, model Behati Prinsloo, who he married earlier this year . Yuck: The two also get covered in a whole lot of blood . 'Maroon 5's video for Animals is a dangerous depiction of a stalker's fantasy — and no one should ever confuse the criminal act of stalking with romance,' Katherine Hull Fliflet, the vice president of RAINN, said in a statement. 'The trivialization of these serious crimes, like stalking, should have no place in the entertainment industry.' RAINN, an acronym for Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, is an organization best known for operating the National Sexual Assault Hotline and carrying out programs to prevent sexual assault, help victims, and ensure that rapists are brought to justice. Dapper dude: Levine has yet to comment on the controversy . Trouble: The Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network called the music video 'dangerous' Creep: Levine follows the woman the entire video . In the video, Levine, 35, plays a butcher who develops an unhealthy obsession with a female customer, played by Prinsloo. He follows her in the streets, photographs her, breaks into her home and then lies in bed with the woman as she sleeps. This then culminates with the two having sex in a fantasy sequence as they are both covered in blood. More trouble: The National Sexual Violence Resource Center also slammed the video, saying Levine treats the woman like a piece of meat . Also quiet: Prinsloo has also declined to comment on the controversy . Unknowing victim: prinsloo, playing the woman, is unaware she is being followed in the video . And RAINN is not alone in voicing their concern with the message this video sends, as the National Sexual Violence Resource Center is also taking Levine to task for treating the woman in the video like a piece of meat, this according to TMZ. Oddly enough, neither organization made any mention of the song's lyrics, which includes lines like, 'Baby, I'm preying on you tonight / Hunt you down eat you alive,' and 'Maybe you think that you can hide / I can smell your scent from miles / Just like animals.' Neither Levine or Prinsloo have commented on the controversy.

"Scientists have uncovered the genetic mechanism which appeared to have led two HIV-infected men to experience a 'spontaneous cure'. They say the discovery could lead to new treatments for the disease. Both men were infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), one of them 30 years ago, but never developed AIDS symptoms. The French group looked at two 'immune' individuals, a 57-year-old man diagnosed HIV-positive in 1985, and a 23-year-old diagnosed in 2011, and sequenced their virus genomes. A rare group of people -- fewer than one percent of those infected -- are naturally able to rein in viral replication and keep the virus at clinically undetectable levels. They are known as 'elite controllers', but the mechanism by which they keep the virus at bay remains a mystery. The French group looked at two such individuals, a 57-year-old man diagnosed HIV-positive in 1985, and a 23-year-old diagnosed in 2011, and sequenced their virus genomes. Though they remained infected, standard tests could not detect the virus in their blood. The team found that in both cases, the virus was unable to replicate in immune cells due to mutations in its genetic code. The AIDS-causing virus remained in their immune cells but was inactivated because its genetic code had been altered, the scientists said. The change appeared to be linked to increased activity of a common enzyme named APOBEC, they theorised. The 'apparent spontaneous cure' throws up an intriguing avenue for drug engineers, the team said in a statement. 'The work opens up therapeutic avenues for a cure, using or stimulating this enzyme, and avenues for identifying individuals among newly-infected patients who have a chance of a spontaneous cure.' The work, published in the journal Clinical Microbiology and Infection, was carried out by scientists at France's Institute of Health and Medical Research (Inserm). HIV replicates by invading human CD4 immune cells, which it reprogrammes to become virus factories. A rare group of people -- fewer than one percent of those infected -- are naturally able to rein in viral replication and keep the virus at clinically undetectable levels. They are known as 'elite controllers', but the mechanism by which they keep the virus at bay remains a mystery.

Though they remained infected, standard tests could not detect the virus in their blood. The team found that in both cases, the virus was unable to replicate in immune cells due to mutations in its genetic code. The researchers suggested spontaneous evolution between humans and the virus, a process called 'endogenisation' that is believed to have neutralised other viruses in humans in the past. A similar process has been witnessed in a population of koalas that has integrated an AIDS-like virus into their genes, neutralised it, and were passing resistance on to their offspring. 'We propose that HIV cure may occur through HIV endogenisation in humans,' the team wrote. 'These findings suggest that without therapeutic and prophylactic strategies, after several decades of HIV/host integrations and millions of deaths, it is likely that a few individuals might have endogenised and neutralised the virus and transmitted it to their progeny,' they added. HIV within the blood-stream: HIV replicates by invading human CD4 immune cells, which it reprogrammes to become virus factories. 'We believe that the persistence of HIV DNA can lead to cure, and protection, from HIV.' The approach hitherto has been the opposite: to try and clear all traces of HIV from human cells and from cell reservoirs where they hide. 'We suggest that persistence of integrated HIV DNA is not a barrier, but on the contrary, may be a prerequisite to HIV cure,' said the study authors. 'We propose a new vision of HIV cure through integration, inactivation and potential endogenisation of a viral genome into the human genome.' - Not unique - . The team said they did not believe the two patients were unique or that the phenomenon was new. And they called for 'massive sequencing' of human DNA, particularly from Africans who had been exposed to HIV for longest, to find further proof. Only one person is thought to have ever been cured of HIV: Timothy Ray Brown who had bone marrow transplants as a treatment for leukaemia, from a donor with resistance to HIV. A baby given anti-AIDS drugs immediately after birth for 18 months, was at first also thought to have been cured, but the virus later came back.","Fewer than 1% of those infected are naturally able to rein in viral replication and keep the virus at clinically undetectable levels .
They are known as 'elite controllers'
Researchers say AIDS-causing virus remained in their immune cells but was inactivated because its genetic code had been altered ."
"Alicia Blagg and Rebecca Gallantree won England's second gold of the opening day of the Commonwealth Games diving competition by stealing first place on their final dive. After Jack Laugher won gold in the men's 1m springboard event in Edinburgh, Blagg and Gallantree followed suit in the women's synchronised 3m springboard. It took England's medal tally at the Royal Commonwealth Pool - which also hosted Commonwealth Games events in 1970 and 1986 - to three from three events. All smiles: Blagg and Gallantree pose with their gold medals after winning the synchronised 3m springboard . Disbelief: Blagg puts her hands to her mouth after realising that she and Gallantree had won gold . England's Sarah Barrow and Tonia Couch claimed silver in the women's synchronised 10m platform on Wednesday afternoon. Blagg and Gallantree scored a high of 72.54 for their fifth and final dive - a forward 3 1/2 somersault - to take gold with a total of 300.24. Canada's Jennifer Abel and Pamela Ware (295.65) claimed silver and bronze went to Australia's Maddison Keeney and Anabelle Smith (294.72). The English success comes before Tom Daley has taken to the boards. Daley's competition begins on Friday with the men's synchronised 10m platform before the individual event he won in Delhi in 2010 takes place on Saturday. In sync: The English pair won their event with their last dive of the day . Great start: Team England won three medals from the opening three events on the first day of diving . For Blagg and Gallantree it was an unexpected triumph, with both enduring injury-plagued 2014 seasons to date. 'I just can't believe it,' Blagg said. 'That last dive it was either a medal or no medal. We had no idea. We thought we were in fourth or fifth. 'To do that dive and then see the scoreboard ranked first it was the best moment of my life. Just disbelief.' Gallantree added: 'We knew we could do a good one (last dive). We have been struggling with it a little bit in training; the timing's been a bit off. 'We've worked really hard on it over the last couple of days. 'To do it in that situation, last dive, when it really mattered, and to do that to get the gold is just amazing.'","Their win made it three medals for England on the opening day of diving .

"Jose Fonte has admitted mistakes like his wayward back-pass in Monday's 2-1 defeat to Manchester United threaten to derail Southampton's impressive Premier League start. Southampton captain Fonte's heavily undersold back-pass to keeper Fraser Forster gifted the lurking Robin van Persie the opening goal at St Mary's. Dutch striker Van Persie then volleyed the winner in the second half after Graziano Pelle had dragged Saints onto level terms.

Keen to make amends for his costly early error, Fonte (left) tries to close down Wayne Rooney . Fonte shouldered the blame for Saints' third straight defeat on his 200th club appearance, then challenged the squad to cut out the costly mistakes. 'It was frustrating: apart from my mistake and that free-kick in the second half, we weren't in danger,' said Fonte. 'They didn't create much, whereas we were in control of the game. 'We were dominating, but we have to stop these mistakes and to try to avoid them because they're costing us. Graziano Pelle brought Southampton on level terms when he rifled home their equaliser in the 31st minute . 'When you play in a game like this and play in the way we did - especially in the first half - then I think it's disappointing for everyone. 'We certainly didn't deserve to lose. We were as good as, if not better than, them - that's why it's disappointing. 'We lost the game because of ourselves.'

Boss Ronald Koeman admitted his side had only themselves to blame for Monday's defeat to United, and Fonte could not argue. Saints travel to early-season strugglers Burnley on Saturday, with Portugal defender Fonte determined to put an end to the run of defeats. 'Unfortunately, we made a couple of mistakes and that cost us some points,' said Fonte. 'We need to learn from it quickly because, at the highest level, the big teams with top-class players will punish you - that's what's happened in the last three games. 'I'm disappointed and frustrated, but we need to pick ourselves up because we have another game on Saturday and we need to get some points.'","Robin van Persie seized on Jose Fonte's early error to score .

"Bronwyn and Jim Monro adopted Nishantha from Sir Lanka into their family when he was 16 months old . When Bronwyn and Jim Monro were told  that their adopted son was schizophrenic 20 years ago, they had no idea what the illness was or what it would come to mean for their family. Their son’s diagnosis, when he was 18-years-old, came after a ‘screaming episode’ in the park near their home in the sought-after suburb of Balmain, in Sydney’s inner west. ‘He was screaming and running around the park. We called the ambulance and police… there are steep cliffs in the park and we were scared he was going to jump off,’ Mrs Monro told Daily Mail Australia. ‘That’s really scary when you don’t understand that they are mentally ill, you don’t know what to do.’ The couple, who are both retired teachers, adopted Nishantha into their family at the age of 16 months, in 1976. He was abandoned at birth and found on the doorsteps of a children’s hospital in Colombo, the capital city of Sri Lanka. They will never know if his mental illness is genetic because the hospital had no records of who his biological parents are. ‘I used to wonder if the rejection from his parents caused his illness,’ Mrs Monro recalled. She said Nishantha was ‘tricky’ from a young age. He would skip classes at school and teachers would describe him as ‘very bright but quiet difficult to manage.’ Mrs Monro, 66, and Mr Monro, 69, already had two biological daughters, now aged 43 and 40, when they adopted him. Three years later they also adopted Chaminda, who became Nisantha’s brother. The couple first took Nishantha to a councillor when he was only little. ‘We knew it was quite difficult to come from overseas and fit in and Balmain is a very yuppy area, there weren’t very many black kids around back then,’ Mrs Monro explained. The Monro family: Kara, Chaminda, Zoe, Nishantha, Jim and Bronwyn (from left to right) lived in the sought-after suburb of Balmain in Sydney's inner-west as the children grew up . Nishantha Monro, pictured here at the age of 18, was diagnosed with schizophrenia 20 years ago . Although Nishantha has never spoken about being bullied growing up in Sydney, his mother conceded that he may have had a hard time. At the age of 15 he took an overdose. ‘I was highly alarmed but I had no idea it was about mental health, it just wasn’t spoken about at the time,’ Mrs Monro said. ‘When he took his overdose we still didn’t know he was going to develop schizophrenia. I didn’t even know what it was when he got the diagnosis at 18,’ she added. The Monros had no history of mental health illness in their family and even the doctors at the time of Nishantha’s overdose did not suspect he was schizophrenic. The terrifying incident happened in 1994 and Mr and Mrs Monro were told their son simply had a personality disorder. A psychiatrist said ‘he’s very spontaneous, he doesn’t think’. Nishantha, seen here at four years old (left) and in the park at the age of eight (right),  was 'tricky' from a young age. Teachers would describe him as 'very bright but quiet difficult to manage,' his mother said . Nishantha was a member of his local scouts group. In this photo he is off to a jamboree at the age of 14 . At 17, Nishantha had started drinking. He was sneaking out at night and taking drugs and when he was 18, after the screaming incident in the park, he punched a hole in the wall and left home. ‘We didn’t understand so we were in this mode of disapproval. He didn’t talk about his feeling but we never invited a discussion because we thought if we used strong parenting we could “sort it out”,’ Mrs Monro said. When Nishantha left home he began drinking a lot. ‘After his landlord chucked him out of one flat, he moved to another place opposite a bottle shop,’ she added. His mother agrees that his drug and alcohol use may be a way to block out his schizophrenia. And last November he stopped taking his prescribed medication, claiming it made him sleepy. ‘He’s still so impulsive and we wonder whether the medication affects his enjoyment of the drugs , the medications are supposed to dull you down a bit and we wonder if they do that inhibit his ability to feel pleasure in life,’ Mrs Monro explained. Bronwyn and Jim Monro want to speak openly about their son and reduce the stigma around schizophrenia . By the age of 21 Nishantha, seen here with his adopted brother Chaminda, had left home and was battling with an alcohol addiction . Nishantha lives in a housing commission building in Redfern. His mother has concerns about him living there because there are ‘drugs and alcohol everywhere’. He’s provided with a disability pension, while Mrs Monro - who worked as a teacher for 42 years - now acts as his carer. ‘He wants to live with us but that would give him more money for drugs and alcohol. When you are not in this drug world it’s very hard to understand. I do try to be positive.’ Over the years Mrs Monro and her husband Jim have gone from knowing nothing about schizophrenia and mental health to educating themselves so that they can not only understand and help their son but also share their experience with other families. They run the Balmain schizophrenia carers group once a month and Mrs Monro also runs a carers group for older ladies in Belmore . ‘We’ve done a lot of courses so we’ve got more educated and informed about drug matters. 'You have no idea what a nice person my son is': Mrs Monro described her son as 'quirky' but said she has never once been scared of him. He is seen here in 2009 at 32 (left) and at 27 in 2002 (right) Mrs Monro said the happiest times she shares with her son are when he opens up to her about his feelings . ‘A burden shared is a burden halved. Just listening to others and being able to share my story means a lot to me… Jim and I believe we need to be open about mental health so people don’t get caught like we were,’ she said. Mrs Monro wants to reduce the stigma around schizophrenia and wants the world to know that the illness does not make someone dangerous. She said she has never been concerned for her own safety around her son. ‘You have no idea what a nice person my son is; he has a quirky personality and is so engaging when he’s functioning well.’ Nishantha is now using meth amphetamine, commonly known as ice, which Mrs Monro said makes him ‘cranky and irritable’ and means he does ‘a lot of screaming’. ‘He tells us he’s been screaming on the bus and in his flat. But my son is not violent.’ For Mrs Monro, the happiest times she shares with her son are when he opens up to her about his feelings. ‘He doesn’t very often say it but sometime he says “I know you love and care for me” and he says “I don’t have any friends now, you and dad are the only people”. Jim Monro, a retired TAFE teacher, seen here with Nishantha on October 21 2013 . Bronwyn (pictured) said she has spent years learning about schizophrenia so she can empathise with her son . ‘The other good moments are when you feel like you can understand him and can stand in his shoes for a few minutes. The only way I could get an insight into his perspective is to do all this training. Jack Heath, CEO of national mental health charity SANE Australia said carers are under pressure . ‘When you grow up in a moralistic upright church way like we did sometimes it’s hard to understand.’ Bronwyn and Jim want to open the discussion around mental health and not turn people off the subject and are supporting charity SANE with a new drive for carers. Over the last decade in Australia, the delivery of mental health services has shifted from institutions to the community, which often means that families carry more and more of the burden of supportive care. More than 230,000 Australians have schizophrenia and it can have a profound effect on those close to them as family members may have feelings of guilt and shame and may have to cope with loved ones who have difficult and demanding behaviour. A new health coaching service for carers of those living with schizophrenia will also soon be launching called CareCompass and a new resource has been launched to help share information called Full Story Schizophrenia. Jack Heath, CEO of national mental health charity SANE Australia told Daily Mail Australia: ‘When a family is first struck by an incident of severe mental illness, they don’t know what to do and where to turn to. But if they feel part of community it helps.' Mr Heath explained how carers also need a break. 'I've spoken to so many carers over the years and it's challenging for them... they tend to through everything  and not remember to look after themselves and they get quite high rates of depression themselves,' he said. For more information for families and friends with loved ones living with schizophrenia, a new resource has been launched: www.fullstoryschizophrenia.com.au.","Bronwyn and Jim Monro adopted their son when he was abandoned at 16 months on the doorsteps of a children's hospital in Sri Lanka .

"Sole suspect: Luis Alonzo Alfaro, 17, has been charged in the deadly Texas school knife fight that left one of his classmates dead and three others injured . The 17-year-old Texas high school student accused of stabbing a classmate to death and injuring three others told police that it all started from bumping shoulders in the cafeteria. Luis Alonzo Alfaro has been charged with murder in the deadly knife fight that left 17-year-old Josh Broussard dead inside Spring High School Wednesday morning. Following his arrest, Alfaro allegedly confessed to the killing, telling detectives he and the victim had a run-in inside the cafeteria at around 7am, which quickly escalated to a bloody fight. The 17-year-old allegedly told police that he bumped shoulders with Broussard, and the two exchanged some words. Alfaro then shoved the teen, and then another student punched him on the left side of his face. Alfaro then pulled a pocket knife out of his shorts and swung it at his adversary while covering his own face with his other arm, according to his statement to police cited by MyFox Houston. Broussard collapsed in the hallway and died after sustaining multiple wounds to his abdomen. After fatally stabbing Brossard and injuring three other students, Alfaro attempted to flee, but was apprehended a short time later.

"What do a Harlem man, a guy who flew from Nigeria to LAX and thousands of other feverish worrywarts across America have in common? They've all checked in to hospitals in recent days believing their headaches and nausea could be the dreaded Ebola virus. And they've all been cleared. Their numbers are also growing. Since Thomas E. Duncan became 'America's patient zero' on September 30, the CDC says its gotten over 800 calls per day from local health workers and other officials desperate to know, 'Does my patient have Ebola?' Ruch of false alarms: A Harlem man checked into New York's Bellevue hospital on Wednesday over fears he had the dreaded Ebola virus. Doctors later cleared him . In all cases except Duncan's, that answer has been an emphatic no. But after the widely panned government response in Dallas to Duncan's diagnosis and thanks to a steady stream of suspected case news stories every day, the false alarms aren't expected to end any time soon. Los Angeles and New York City have seen two of the most recent of these cases. On Wednesday, a Harlem man checked into Bellevue hospital complaining of a fever and was initially treated as a potential Ebola case, according to the New York Post. The man had recently traveled from Nigeria and was suffering from diarrhea and vomiting, but was apparently given the okay. 'There's nobody with Ebola and nobody suspected of having Ebola at Bellevue,' a hospital spokesman told the Post. The Los Angeles case in Inglewood on Tuesday was actually one of 8 in the county who've been tested, according to KTLA. All tests have come back negative. Another major city where multiple false alarms have made headlines is Washington, DC, where Ebola was ruled out as a potential cause of illness in a man at Howard University Hospital just days after Duncan's diagnosis. Around the same time, at nearby George Washington University, a patient was found to have the flu and not Ebola, as was initially feared. Hands are tied: The CDC says any potential Ebola patient is someone with a fever who's recently traveled to West African nations currently dealing with the Ebola outbreak, so hundreds or even thousands of people in America have become--if ever so briefly--suspected cases since 'patient zero' Thomas Duncan was diagnosed Sept. 30 . A third Washington-area patient, in the suburb of Rockville, had Ebola ruled out as a possibility that very same weekend. On Wednesday, an American Airlines flight landed at Midland airport in Texas and passengers filed out wearing masks after a passenger 'exhibited one symptom of the Ebola virus on a flight from Dallas.' She too, experts ruled, is Ebola-free. According to Forbes.com's math using CDC's numbers, some 5,000 Ebola false alarms have been sounded since Duncan was diagnosed. As news of Duncan's Wednesday morning death was still breaking, another potential Ebola case--and potential false alarm--came out of Texas. A deputy sheriff who entered the Dallas apartment the Liberian occupied while he was ill checked in to a Frisco, Texas hospital Wednesday afternoon exhibiting 'signs and symptoms of Ebola.' Sgt Monnig's son, Logan Monnig, told CBS that his father had woken up with 'stomach issues' and had gone to the clinic as a precaution. Logan said family were told by the CDC that their father was not at risk of the virus, as he had only been in the apartment for 30 minutes and had not come in contact with bodily fluids. 'We are not expecting him to' test positive for Ebola, said Logan. Widespread fear: Centinela Hospital in LA County had a 'potential Ebola patient' on Tuesday who turned out to be another false alarm, one of 8 in the county thus fay .","A Harlem man checked into a New York City hospital on Wednesday complaining of possible Ebola symptoms after traveling to Nigeria .

"The cost of the Foreign Secretary using VIP airport suites was more than £100,000 over four years, with William Hague holding the position for most of that time . The Foreign Office has spent more than £2million on VIP airport suites in four years, figures show. Between 2010 and 2014 its total bill for using exclusive lounges at home and abroad was almost £2.4million. Just over £2million went on providing VIP services for visiting foreign dignitaries, while the cost of the Foreign Secretary using them amounted to more than £100,000 over the four years. William Hague held the position from May 2010 until July this year. The figures were published on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website in a response to a freedom of information request. They showed that the FCO’s overall spending on using airport VIP lounges almost halved in 2013/14 compared to the previous year. The bulk of the FCO’s spending on the lounges was for visits by foreign heads of state and other dignitaries. The bill for overseas guests was highest in 2010/11 and 2011/12, with a total of £669,019.68 and £715,157.76 spent in those years respectively. It fell to £489,953.96 in 2012/13 and £197,444.00 in the most recent 12-month period. Two payments of £100,000 in 2012/13 and 2013/14 for a contract to use the Royal Suite at Heathrow made up the rest of the total. The response said: 'In November 2012 we reviewed our position on the use of VIP suites and as a result moved away from part owning the Heathrow Royal Suite to becoming a contracted customer for private flights. 'This represented better value for money and greater freedom to use other facilities. Our contract with Heathrow Airport Limited costs the FCO £100,000 per annum, in return for 50 private flight movements with exclusive rights to the suite whenever required.” The Heathrow VIP website says departing guests enjoy an 'oasis of calm' in a private lounge before being chauffeur driven directly to the aircraft. Arriving passengers are greeted by staff before being 'whisked away by luxury vehicle' to their private lounge.","Foreign Office bill for VIP airport suites hit £2.4million over four years .

"Expensive drink: The Warren Cup was bought by British Museum trustees 15 years ago for £1.8million . One of the most treasured  exhibits at the British Museum has been denounced as a fake by a German archaeologist. The Warren Cup – a silver Roman drinking vessel – was picked by the museum’s director Neil MacGregor for his History of the World in 100 Objects series. Trustees bought it 15 years ago for £1.8million. But at a public debate, Luca Giuliani challenged the museum’s long-held view that the object dates from the reign of Nero in the first century AD. The professor of classical archaeology at Humboldt University in Berlin claimed the cup was in fact a creation of the early 20th century . He argued that its explicit depiction of two sets of male lovers was unknown in Roman silverware. He suggested the cup was designed for the pleasure of its former owner – a wealthy American gay man, Edward Perry Warren, who bought it in Rome in 1911. Warren acquired other apparently counterfeit pieces before his death in 1928. The Warren Cup features male lovers in various poses. One pair shows the erastes – an older, active lover – as bearded and wearing a wreath. The  eromenos – the younger, passive beloved – is beardless. Professor Giuliani’s doubts were aired in Germany last year, but Wednesday marked the first time he has addressed a British audience on the subject. He told the debate at King’s College London yesterday: ‘There is no other Roman silver tableware with a comparable subject matter. ‘Silver vessels have a completely different iconography. Sexual escapades have no place here.’ Potential fakery: German archeologist Luca Giuliani challenged the claim made by the British Museum, pictured, that the Warren Cup dates from the reign of Nero in the first century AD . Professor  Dyfri Williams, author of a book on the Warren Cup, described his German opposite number as ‘a very intelligent, highly respected scholar’ but told the audience he disagreed with his theories. The fact that Warren bought other fakes is irrelevant, he said. He also dismissed the uniqueness of the design as evidence of inauthenticity. He added: ‘We’re really only reacting to each piece when it’s found. We may find something spectacular next week.’","The Warren Cup was bought by British Museum trustees for £1.8m .

"It was just like any other summer's day for Sharon Camisa who enjoyed tending to her garden. So when she became gravely ill, she never thought that potting mix would be the fatal catalyst. Little did she know that the common backyard material contains bacteria which can potentially be deadly. But by the time doctors found the cause Ms Camisa's condition was deteriorating to the point that she was on life support and in a coma, A Current Affair reports. Scroll down for video . The Camisa family (from left) daughter Tiala, husband Mark, wife Sharon and son Michael. Sharon died in January . The 42-year-old was diagnosed with legionnaires' disease from bacteria which can be found in potting mix . By the time doctors found the cause, it was too late for the mother-of-two who was already on life support and in a coma . In December - a few days after Ms Camisa repotted some plants - the mother-of-two had trouble breathing, suffered sore joints and couldn't sleep. The 42-year-old, from Collie which is in the south west region of Western Australia, and her family didn't take it seriously, thinking it was just her arthritis. However Ms Camisa progressively become sicker each day and to which doctors wrongly treated her for pneumonia. Husband Mark, Ms Camisa's high school sweetheart, is still grieving the loss of his soul mate whom he'd been married to for 25 years. 'Sharon was my life ... I didn't need anybody else,' he told A Current Affair. 'Sharon was my soul mate, my best friend.' The Camisa family want to raise awareness about the dangers of potting mix and are pushing for each bag to be sold with face masks . Husband Mark described his wife as his 'best friend' and 'soul mate'. They were high school sweethearts . Daughter Tiala and son Michael are still mourning the death of their mother . Family and friends surround Ms Camisa on New Years Eve while she was still in hospital . When symptoms become worse, a blood test found that Ms Camisa had a lung infection caused by legionella bacteria - which can be found in potting mix. She was diagnosed with legionnaires' disease but by that time it was too late. Ms Camisa was in a coma and on life support. She died just 34 days after she was diagnosed with the disease. 'It definitely makes it harder knowing that it could've been prevented earlier on in the stages if it got picked up by the doctors,' daughter Tiala said. 'It doesn't get any easier, you just get used to it,' son Michael said. Just nine months after Ms Camisa's death, her family is urging Australians to be cautious when handling potting mix. Experts say it's important to always wear gloves and a face mask when gardening. 'To lose a loved one over something so small as a 20 cent dust mask - it's heartbreaking,' husband Mark said. 'So I'm trying to get the awareness out there so people can understand that yes it can happen.' He also wants bigger warning signs and is pushing for each bag of potting mix to be sold with a mask.","Sharon Camisa died in January from legionnaires' disease which is bacteria commonly found in potting mix .

"Careworn: This self-portrait of Rembrandt included in the exhibition shows him in the autumn of his life, greying, fraying at the edges, but more daring, brilliant and defiant than ever . The bearded art critics of Amsterdam had little to say in praise of Rembrandt van Rijn — and he had nothing good to say about them. After one particular savaging, Rembrandt vented his spleen on a page of his sketchbook. He drew a caricature of an art critic, a man with the ears of a donkey and a snake winding up one arm, sitting on a barrel of grog. As far as he was concerned, the critics were as poisonous as vipers and had all the intelligence of a drunken ass. Whatever the insults Rembrandt suffered in his lifetime, the critics saved their worst for after his death. One former pupil wrote that Rembrandt’s paint ‘runs down his work like dung’, another that it looked as though the colour had been smeared on with a bricklayer’s trowel and that his canvases were so thickly encrusted you could pick them up off the floor ‘by their nose’. While he lived, Rembrandt must have found the abuse he suffered particularly galling because the critics had nothing but praise for his rival Peter Paul Rubens, 29 years his senior. Rubens was feted at the courts of kings and dukes across Europe. He was ‘the prince of painters and the painter of princes’, according to one English ambassador. Rembrandt, on the other hand, was king of the dungheap. Still, he had the last laugh. Who now remembers the names of the carping critics Arnold Houbraken and Gerard de Lairesse? Rembrandt’s paintings hang in the collections of the world’s greatest museums. Three million visitors a year see his monumental Night Watch, which takes up an entire wall of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. Later artists worshipped him. Vincent van Gogh wrote that his paintings were ‘fathomlessly deep’ and that the artist was a ‘magician’. This week, his Portrait Of A Man With Arms Akimbo will be auctioned in London for an estimated £30.4 million — a record asking price for the artist’s work. He would have been grateful — gobsmacked even — to have earned such sums in his lifetime. The Rembrandt who looks out at you from the walls of the National Gallery’s new blockbuster exhibition, which opened this week, is a careworn bankrupt. Every unpaid bill, every bailiff’s knock, every crash of the gavel as his possessions were auctioned off to the highest bidder, is there in his heavy eyes, his parchment skin, his doleful, turned-down mouth. His forehead is as narrowly lined as a map of Amsterdam’s canals. This is Rembrandt in the autumn of his life, greying, fraying at the edges, but more daring, brilliant and defiant than ever. It is a dazzling show. The galleries are dimly lit, but such is Rembrandt’s alchemy that his paintings have a light of their own. It is as if a candle is burning behind each canvas. He has an eye for sumptuous surfaces: an ostrich-feather fan that makes you want to reach out and fluff its plumes; a breast plate gone rusty in the rain of the battlefield; a lustrous pearl bracelet. Past the first flush of youth himself, he paints old age with an extraordinary intensity. Scroll down for video . His portrait of 78-year-old Margaretha de Geer may show her tiny and shrunken with age, but this wealthy merchant’s wife fixes the viewer with a fierce, shrewd look. Her sparrow’s head looks like a single bean in the middle of her enormous, platter-like white ruff. Her husband, the 85-year-old Jacob Trip, is painted in an ornate robe which isn’t like fabric at all, but a cloud of sulphur vapour. It is a bravura bit of visual trickery, this greatest of artists showing what he can do. By 1650, the year from which this exhibition charts his work, Rembrandt was a man who had been beaten about by life — though he gave as good as he got. His adored wife Saskia, whose wheatfield curls he had delighted in painting, had died of tuberculosis. He had buried three of their babies and was left to bring up his son Titus alone. His domestic arrangements were a mess. He had taken his son’s nurse Geertje as his mistress, then fallen in love with his housekeeper Hendrickje. When he wanted Geertje out, he behaved monstrously. He tried to pay her off, and when she wouldn’t go quietly, he leaned on friends to spread malicious rumours that she was insane. He had her sent to a Spinhuis — a house of correction — where women who were ill, abandoned or criminal spun wool in freezing rooms while overseers preached the Scriptures. Rembrandt may have freed himself from Geertje, but his debts were harder to shake off. Rembrandt was derided in his lifetime, but Portrait Of A Man With Arms Akimbo will be auctioned this week for an estimated £30.4million . These two self-portraits show the hard life Rembrandt endured. Every unpaid bill, every bailiff’s knock, is there in his heavy eyes, his parchment skin, his doleful, turned-down mouth. His forehead is as narrowly lined as a map of Amsterdam’s canals . He was a paradoxical creature: a miser and a spendthrift. He was such a pinchpenny that his students would paint coins on the floor and snigger when he scrabbled to pick them up, and at the same time so extravagant that he ran up debts that would ruin him. When he bought a house in one of Amsterdam’s most fashionable streets for a massive 13,000 guilders, he took out risky loans and lied to his creditors to finance it. He had a magpie’s eye for fine things. When the debt collectors made an inventory of his possessions after his bankruptcy in 1656, they found busts of Roman emperors, prints, paintings, fossils, rare minerals and natural curiosities, among them a stuffed armadillo. After losing his grand townhouse, Rembrandt cared less and less about keeping up appearances to impress clients. Unlike Rubens, the princely flatterer, Rembrandt didn’t fawn over his patrons. He wore his paint-splattered smock, his breath smelled of stale beer and by middle-age his teeth were rotten. In the long economic depression that followed the First Anglo-Dutch War of 1652-54, those who had managed to hold on to their money were loath to spend it on a painting by a grubby bankrupt. It was in this period of darkness, though, that Rembrandt produced some of his most luminous work. He became more devil-may-care and stubbornly self-confident, slapping paint onto the canvas like a butcher laying out steaks on a marble slab. But the results, far from crude, were endlessly subtle. He painted a self-portrait, which hangs in the first room of the exhibition, in which he is wrapped in a gold mantle. It is as if he is announcing: ‘I have the Midas touch.’ Three million visitors a year see his Night Watch (pictured), which takes up an entire wall of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam . How could anyone have accused Rembrandt of painting with dung? These paintings turn clod colours into gold. Even in the National Gallery’s basement, they glow. In one of the self-portraits in the exhibition, Rembrandt stands in his studio, his shoulders square to us, his gaze steady and challenging. With his fur-trimmed robe and curious white cap, he looks like a magus about to cast a spell. But he doesn’t need anything as flash or ridiculous as a wand. He holds in his hand the secret to his own sort of magic: an old palette and a handful of brushes loaded with paint. Rembrandt: The Late Works is at the National Gallery until January 18.

"Fancy living in a city under the sea? A designer who is passionate about the concept of living underwater has created his own dream community, and hopes that his big idea will one day become a reality. Phil Pauley says that he has dreamed about building an underwater city for the past 20 years, and has now released images of what the futuristic development might look like. Sub-Biosphere 2 comes compete with eight 'bio-dome' structures, and is 1,105ft wide. The Sub-Biosphere 2 would not look out of place in a science fiction film. But designer Phil Pauley hopes that it will one day become a reality . Conceptual designer Mr Pauley, who describes himself as a futurist, says the structure will consist of a central support biosphere, an observation pod, and dwelling pods which will house up to 100 people. Each of the dwelling pods will house individual eco systems, and there will be no need to rely on air and food from the outside world. Mr Pauley, who is the founder of a London-based visual communications consultancy, said: 'Building an underwater city is all I have thought about for the last 20 years. Mr Pauley says the structure would be a self sustainable underwater habitat .

'I don't want to come across as fanatical, so I am waiting for the right time, when people come around to the idea for themselves. 'When that happens I will be hear with my design.' Mr Pauley's design was inspired by plans by the University of Arizona for a a research facility of the same name - but so far developments on the project appear to have stalled. As well as designing his dream city, Mr Pauley is also looking for a publisher for a science fiction trilogy of books for young adults, The Moral Order.

"A mother has died after accidentally eating the world’s deadliest mushroom – which she found sprouting in her garden. Christina Hale, 57, was taken  to hospital after consuming  poisonous death cap mushrooms but died of multiple organ failure. Her husband, who ate a smaller amount of the deadly mushroom, survived. Lucky escape: Writer Nicholas Evans survived after poisoning himself and his family with death cap mushrooms. His daughter Lauren donated one of her kidneys so he could undergo a transplant . He was also hospitalised but . recovered and is understood to have returned to the home he shared with . his wife in Bridgwater, Somerset. An inquest into Mrs Hale’s death has been opened and adjourned by West Somerset Coroner’s  Court and a full hearing will take place next year. Coroner Michael Rose said: ‘The cause of death was multiple organ failure due to poisoning by the death cap mushroom. ‘She was admitted to hospital on the 18th of November and died on the 19th.’ The last recorded British fatality caused by a death cap mushroom was in 2008. The death cap mushroom – Amanita phalloides – is responsible for the majority of deaths from accidental mushroom poisoning because of its similar appearance to safe varieties. Just one stem is considered enough to kill an adult. Often found in the autumn near oak trees, the death cap is a large mushroom with white gills and a cup-shaped sack around the base of the stem. They are said to taste pleasant and smell faintly of roses. But symptoms do not start to appear for up to 16 hours after consumption. The ensuing stomach pain, vomiting and diarrhoea can then ease, leading the victim to believe a recovery is underway. But the toxins continue to attack the body and death from liver or kidney failure typically occurs six to 16 days after consumption. Last year the National Poisons Information Service (NPIS) said there were 257 cases of poisoning linked to eating mushrooms. Dr John Thompson, of the NPIS, said: ‘While many mushrooms growing in the wild are tasty and safe to eat, it is not always easy to differentiate between toxic and non-toxic species – even for people with experience in foraging.’ He added that people should not eat mushrooms collected in the wild unless they are familiar with UK species and are sure the mushrooms they have collected are safe to eat.","Couple had picked crop of death cap mushrooms in Bridgwater, Somerset .

"Nigella Lawson's admission that she took cocaine and smoked cannabis is unlikely to damage her career and may even give it a boost, PR experts have claimed. The TV chef is currently trying to crack the lucrative American market with a second series of her show The Taste due to start airing next month. Earlier attempts by Lawson to make a name for herself in U.S. have failed, and while some experts say the controversy will have damaged her reputation beyond repair, others argue she will bounce back. Brave face: TV chef Nigella Lawson will bounce back from revelations that she took drug, say PR experts . The revelations that she has used illegal . drugs have emerged as part of the fraud trial of her two personal assistants . at Isleworth Crown court. In a scathing email, ex husband Charles Saatchi accused her of being 'so off your head on drugs' that she had allowed the PAs to spend 'whatever they liked'. Yesterday, in a dramatic courtroom confession, Lawson admitted to having snorted cocaine and having smoked cannabis in front of her children. But she denied being an addict claiming said she needed the drugs to cope with the death of her first husband, John Diamond, and the ‘intimate terrorism’ of her second, Charles Saatchi. An advert for Nigella's new American TV show, The Taste was broadcast just hours after allegations of the TV chef's cocaine use were heard in court . Lawson appears to have garnered a great deal of sympathy owing to the nature of her marriage breakdown, in which she has been portrayed as the victim and Saatchi as something of a bully. Saatchi received a police caution after pictures of him grabbing his clearly distressed wife by the throat during a restaurant lunch were published in the press. After the drugs allegations were raised last month, one expert was quoted as saying: ‘If these allegations are proven and substantiated, then her career on American TV is over.’ Divorce: Nigella Lawson divorced her husband Charles Saatchi earlier this year after she was photographed apparently being throttled by the millionaire art editor . But some U.S. commentators have pointed to the fact that Lawson's co-host on the Taste, the chef Anthony Bourdain has admitted . having been a habitual drug user himself, before going on to become a successful TV star. Bourdain was one of the many famous names to have tweeted messages in support of Lawson, using the hashtag #TeamNigella. The Taste has been commissioned by . Channel 4, which said filming for the ten-episode series had . finished and will be screened in Britain early next year as planned. PR guru Mark Borkowski, compared Nigella to the likes of Kate Moss, BP, Ryan Air and Elton John,  'brands', which have successfully bounced back from adverse publicity. Writing in his personal blog he said: 'Post crisis the beleaguered brand with the best story will recover more quickly. 'Brands and individuals may well suffer slights and injuries, but with a brilliant team, smarter thinking, resilient strategy, perspective and intuitive creativity they can rise from yesterday’s newspaper with a stronger narrative and a much brighter, sounder future.' Lawson, who is often described as something of a domestic goddess, is currently represented by . Mark Hutchinson PR who also manages authors J K Rowling and Booker Prize Winner Andrea Levy. She received a huge amount of support after allegations of her drug-taking first emerged with thousands taking to Twitter to voice their support. They were rewarded with a ‘Holiday . Hotcake’ recipe, from Lawson who said she wanted to ‘show thanks for all . your support & to those who hashtag teamNigella’. No lasting damage: Celebrities like Elton John and Kate Moss have successfully bounced back from drug scandals . Sales of Lawson's latest cookbook Nigellissima have actually increased since October, however this has been put down to the fact that BBC 2 has aired a tie-in show in Northern Ireland. Jon Howells, a spokesman for Waterstones, told the Times: 'She's one of our most loved cookery writers. I've no doubt that when she brings another book out it will be a best seller'. Terence Fane-Saunders, chief executive London-based PR firm Chelgate, told Time magazine that Lawson should 'do what other reformed drug users have done in the past and insist that it’s behind her. 'There are a lot of distinguished people out there who’ve made similar admissions and have been able to go forward with their career.'

However, the drawcards of the house were enough to sway many prospective home owners, who saw the panoramic views of Sydney Harbour as enough to take the risk of bidding on the property. 3 James Lane was bought by Balmain 'downsizers' who were reportedly planning to spend a further $600,000 renovating the residence before moving in.

The neglected and overgrown backyard of the East Balmain property, which sold for a massive $830,000 over reserve. The trend continued with several other properties, including an 'abandoned warehouse' at 164-166 Wilson Street, Newtown. The residence sold for $1,725,000 on Monday, despite the new owners being threatened by the previous tenants- squatters who had made the 'dilapidated shell' their home. The previous owner had paid a mere $68,000 for the property in 1981, and chose not to renovate before selling up last week. The new owners reportedly plan to transform it into two 10-metre wide family home, with dual parallel driveways. The real estate did not disclose the reserve price, but said it was well under the selling price. The 'abandoned warehouse' at 164-166 Wilson Street, Newtown, which sold for $1,725,000 on Monday . The garage of the property, which was formerly lived in by squatters that have threatened the new owners . Then there's the string of Millers Point public housing properties, particular the dual properties on Fort St, which have sold for astounding prices. Three of the four properties have sold for $1 million above the reserve price, despite aged floorboards and peeling paint tarnishing the residences. Despite being sorely in need of renovations, the first of the Millers Point property offered, 11 Lower Fort Street, sold for $3.95 million – $1.25 million above the reserved asking price. The second  23 Lower Fort Street, sold for $2,685,000 – $985,000 above the reserved asking price. The extraordinary sale prices reflect the continuing 'price bubble', which housing analysts have predicted will continue indefinitely. Previously, Peter Kelahar, Director of PK Property told Daily Mail Australia that limited housing stock is driving house prices up, with the demand for more properties pushing property valuations up even further. Kelahar advises that many agents will start their campaigns after the October long weekend. 'They're ready to flick the switch,' he said, 'They have all the photos taken and are just waiting for the right time.' 'At the moment it's a bit of a Mexican standoff, where people don't want to put their property up if they can't find somewhere to live. It'll loosen eventually, but just be aware of the trends.'

"Nipper, the famous HMV dog, has been immortalised with his own blue plaque in London. The terrier cross was painted in 1899 sitting with his ear to a wind-up gramophone and featured on hundreds of millions of records produced by the HMV label over more than a century. His place in musical history was marked at a special ceremony last week organised by the British Plaque Trust and attended by executives from HMV, which stands for His Master’s Voice. Nipper, the HMV dog, will be immortalised with a blue plaque at a ceremony in central London next month . The blue plaque will be unveiled to the public at the Cavalry and Guards Club in Piccadilly, central London . The plaque will be unveiled to the public early next month. Nipper (1884-1895) had many superstar fans in the world of music, with artists as varied as Elvis, The Beatles and leading classical performers posing with his image. The plaque will be displayed at the Cavalry and Guards Club, 126 Piccadilly, Central London, where artist Francis Barraud, the dog’s final owner, painted Nipper from memory. Disc gramophones first appeared in the 1890s and by 1902 the forerunner to HMV, the Gramophone Company, was taking shape. The first HMV store opened in July 1921 on Oxford Street. In 1931 the Gramophone Company, with its His Master’s Voice record label, merged with the Columbia Gramophone Company to form Electric and Musical Industries Ltd (EMI), meaning that Nipper not only featured on the HMV label, but also on associated brands including RCA Victor and Deutsche Grammophon. The British Plaque Trust raises funds for blue plaques to commemorate personalities and organisations that have contributed to the British way of life.","Nipper, the HMV dog, will be immortalised with a blue plaque next month .

"England batsman Sam Robson has signed a new deal with Middlesex which will keep him with the county until the end of 2016 at least. The announcement comes ahead of a key winter for Robson, who will head off with the England Lions knowing his place at the top of his country's order is under threat. Yorkshire pair Alex Lees and Adam Lyth are also touring and after averaging just over 30 throughout the English summer, Robson's place alongside Alastair Cook is likely to be tested. England batsman Sam Robson has extended his stay with Middlesex until at least 2016 . His county future is more than secure, though, with Middlesex rewarding the 25-year-old who joined them in 2008 after leaving Australia, the country of his birth. He has scored almost 4,000 runs for them at an average of more than 40. 'I am delighted to sign a new contract with Middlesex, especially after what has been an incredible 12 months for me,' Robson said. 'After scoring five centuries in six matches for the EPP and the Lions earlier in the year and then scoring my maiden Test century in my second Test, I am looking forward to building on this and am sure my best is yet to come. Robson is bowled out for 19 runs playing for England against Sri Lanka in June 2014 . 'I am very grateful for the support Middlesex have given me over the last seven years and look forward to continuing my career with this great club.' Middlesex's director of cricket, Angus Fraser, was equally pleased. 'I am naturally delighted that Sam continues to commit himself to Middlesex CCC. He is the sort of player any club would want to build their future around and we always enjoy having him in our team,' he said. 'During the past four years he has developed in to a high quality cricketer and his consistent performances for Middlesex CCC were rightly rewarded with selection for England's Test side. 'Everyone at the club is extremely proud of the fact that Middlesex has helped develop another England cricketer and the supporters of both these teams can look forward to him scoring lots of runs for them in the future.'","Sam Robson will stay with Middlesex until the end of 2016 at least .

"The world’s finest caviar is harvested from sturgeon in waters around Russia, Iran... and now Devon. The exotic delicacy, known as black gold for its exorbitant price tag, is being made in Britain for the first time. Father and son team Patrick and George Noble used to breed sturgeon to sell as ornamental fish for garden ponds. Exmoor Caviar Farm in Devon has become the first fish farm in Britain to produce and sell caviar after harvesting Sturgeon eggs . The farm had its first full harvest just two weeks ago and has already had its produce sampled by celebrity chefs . Now, they have teamed up with caviar . trader Kenneth Benning to produce caviar they hope will outdo the farmed . European versions commonly sold in Britain. But first, they had to ask a very important person for her permission. Sturgeon, . extremely rare in the UK, is classified as a royal fish under ancient . law, meaning the monarch has to be consulted before any caught here are . sold. So the team wrote to the Queen to ask if they could start a farm. Yesterday Mr Benning said: ‘We didn’t want to end up in the Tower. We got a letter back from Buckingham Palace saying she would forego her royal prerogative and the sturgeon would be our property.’ Producing caviar is a slow and complex process. Unfertilised . roe – tiny eggs, which are the main ingredient – are extracted from . female sturgeon when they reach reproductive maturity, which can be at . anything from six to 25 years old, depending on the species. The farm is home to six different species of Sturgeon, like the Siberian Sturgeon pictured here with one of the farm's owners, Pat Noble . Between 20,000 and 30,000 Sturgeon are kept in holdable tanks. Caviar is notoriously difficult to produce as the fish do not mature at the same time, and therefore produce eggs at varying points in their lives . Water from the River Mole is used at the farm and is not controlled by temperature or adjusted with chemicals . Mr . Benning added: ‘The big farms elsewhere produce about 35 tons of caviar . a year. If we can produce 500kg a year we’ll be happy – we’re going for . quality not quantity.’ The . Exmoor Caviar Farm in North Devon has between 20,000 and 30,000 fish, . which enjoy a ‘semi-wild’, non-caged life in 700-hectare freshwater . lakes. Among them are . various types of sturgeon including Siberian, which produce 1.5kg (53oz) of caviar each, and a Beluga-Sterlet cross, which produces 400g (14oz). The only addition to the eggs is sea salt to add flavour. Sturgeon have been classified 'Royal' since the 1300s when they were given the name by King Edward II . Exmoor Caviar Company produced two variations of produce in its first full harvest, using Cornish and Hebridean sea salt to add a little flavour to the eggs . In . order to make the fish grow, the water temperature at caviar farms is . usually kept at 22C, but the Exmoor project uses fresh running water, . which is not controlled. Mr . Benning said: ‘The water on our farm comes straight from the River Mole . in the Exmoor National Park and it has no chemicals or temperature . regulations. ‘This gives the caviar a wonderful taste, although it can mean it takes the sturgeon a longer period of time to grow.’ After years of waiting, the team took in their first full harvest a fortnight ago. And . according to Michelin-starred chefs Michel Roux Junior from Le Gavroche . in London and Mark Hix from Hix Soho, they haven’t done too badly. In . a testimonial on the farm’s website,  Mr Roux said: ‘You have all of . the British  sturgeon’s royal history, the location of the farm in Devon... It’s brilliant. I think you are on to a winner.' Sturgeon have been classified 'Royal' since the 1300s when they were given the name by King Edward II . Not only are Sturgeon rarely seen in the UK but the process of harvesting their eggs is made notoriously difficult by a number of factors, making caviar such a sought after delicacy . Harry Ferguson from the London Fine food company with one of the first crop of British caviar at the farm. The Exmoor Caviar Company has received raving reviews from customers including chef, Mark Hix . Mr Hix said: ‘British caviar – who would have thought it? ‘From the South West, a fish that once bred in our rivers and has now gone is back. Farmed? Yes and extremely sustainable.’ Sat . Bains, whose Nottingham restaurant has two Michelin stars and who . appeared on BBC cookery show Great British Menu, commented: ‘Exmoor . Caviar is delicious and as good as any I’ve tasted. I also love the fact . that it is from a sustainable and ethical source.' After the eggs are removed from the females, they are washed, hand-sieved and then rested, and Cornish sea salt is added. Mr . Benning, who owns caviar wholesaler Shah Caviar, said meat from the . female fish, which are killed in harvesting, has been sent to top chefs . in the hope they will find ways of putting it on their menus.The finished product comes in tins as small as 10g – which is lucky, since even then, prices start at £19.99. Just . 30g costs £59.95, while it is £99.95 for 50g, £249.95 for 125g and £500 . for 250g – but that is still less than half the price of the most . sought-after Beluga caviar, which comes mainly from the Caspian Sea.","Exmoor Caviar Farm in Devon is the first fish farm in Britain to sell delicacy .

"An overjoyed son has met his real mother for the first time in 57 years after she gave him away when he was just a six week old baby. Kevin Scott, 57, who lives in Chepstow, South Wales, was born out of wedlock in a nursing home for unmarried mothers - and feared he would meet his natural mother. But Kevin and his birth mother Pat Johnson were in floods of tears today after they were reunited with a giant hug. Kevin Scott, 57, met his birth mother, Pat Johnson, 78, for the first time in 57 years today . Kevin tracked his mother down to her place of work after his adoptive parents died, but he was told she had retired 10 years earlier. But Pat's former work colleagues agreed to pass on Kevin's number - not knowing if she would want to relive her past. Kevin was at home the next day when the phone rang and a woman rang asked his date of birth. When he gave it, the voice at the end of the line said: 'This is your mum.' Pat, 78, packed a suitcase and left her home near Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, to travel 200 miles to meet her son for the first time since 1957. Kevin as a baby (l) and Pat at her son Neil Johnson's wedding in 1987 (r) Pictured here is Kevin when he was two and aged six . Pat said: 'I never thought I'd see my Kevin again - all I ever had was one photograph to remind me of him and that got destroyed years ago. 'I can still remember Monday October 20 1957 when I carried him down the stairs to the childless couple who were adopting him. 'It broke my heart but as the years went by I resigned myself to the fact I'd never see my little boy again.' Pat was taken in by the church-run Quarry Nursing Home for Unmarried Mothers in Lincoln when she became pregnant at the age of 20. She said: 'There was a great deal of shame attached to being an unmarried mother in those days - I gave my baby up because I felt I had no choice. 'I still live near Lincoln but I can't bear to look at the old nursing home - it brings back too many memories.' Kevin was brought up in Scunthorpe by Doris and Dennis Scott, who moved to South Wales in 1964 when their adopted little boy was just seven. When Doris died four years ago Kevin, a mechanic, decided it was time he discovered who his real mother was. He was inspired by Davina McCall's ITV show which featured a case at the Quarry Maternity Home. Pictured here is Kevin age four with his adoptive mother Doris Scott . Kevin with adopted mother Doris. When she died four years ago he decided to track down his birth mother . After an approach to social services drew a blank he told his story to his next door neighbour Dikka Cram, 49, who offered to help. Dikka worked her magic on the internet - and just three days later Kevin took the call from the mother he feared he'd lost for ever. Kevin said: 'When we met I was tingling all over - it was brilliant and of course there were a lot of tears. 'She just looked at me and said, ""Come here"", and gave me a big hug. It is all like some sort of surreal dream so much time has passed. 'But I have my mum now and that's all that matters. I just love calling her mum, just saying the word is brilliant.' Divorced father-of-four Kevin has also discovered he has a half-brother Neil, stepfather George, 80, and lots of other relatives - Pat was the youngest of 11 children. Pictured here is Pat's other son Neil with trophies he won in pool competitions in 1979 . He said: 'We can't stop talking and we keep finding out more and more about each other. 'I'm very proud of her because she must have gone through a lot of heartache to give me up because I was born out of wedlock. 'But she went on to become a successful businesswoman. 'We will make up for lost time and I'm already planning to visit her at her home to meet my new family. 'I don't know how to thank Dikka - I had wondered about my proper mum all my life and she found her for me in just three days.' Musician and mother-of-one Dikka said: 'I just did it as a favour for a friend. I'm just thrilled for both of them, it is a real happy ending.'

"Ed Miliband has urged Labour MPs not to panic about public concern over immigration – despite polls showing the party’s reputation on the issue slumping to a six year low amid a surge in support for Ukip. The embattled Labour leader told a private meeting of MPs that the party could not ‘out-Ukip Ukip’. He insisted Labour had the right policies on immigration and told MPs they needed to just ‘keep going on at it’, a source told MailOnline. But Mr Miliband risks accusations of being in denial over the scale of the party’s problem on immigration in the wake of last week’s shock by-election in Heywood and Middleton, which saw Ukip fall just 600 votes short of beating Labour in its Greater Manchester heartland. Scroll down for video . Just 13 per cent of the public say Labour has the best policies on immigration, the lowest level since September 2008 . A damning YouGov survey released today reveals Labour’s poll rating on immigration has fallen to its lowest since September 2008 – despite Mr Miliband unveiling the party’s set-piece pledges on the issue over the weekend. On Sunday, Mr Miliband announced that migrants would have to ‘earn the right’ to claim benefits and face English language tests before taking up jobs. Stronger border controls and laws to stop ‘exploitation that has undermined wages of local workers’ will also be introduced, he said. Despite the pledges, just 13 per cent of the public back Labour’s policies on immigration, according to YouGov. Meanwhile, more than four in 10 Ukip supporters who say they are going to back the party at the election claim the single biggest reason is immigration . Labour MP Graham Stringer said voters in Heywood and Middleton had turned their backs on Labour because of immigration. He said: ‘You only had to knock on three or four doors in Middleton or Heywood to find that what people were talking about was immigration. ‘Now, immigration is a very complicated issue, but you can’t hope to win elections if you don’t talk about what the people are talking about.’ Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper has also admitted that the issue is a problem. She said: ‘We should talk more about immigration and the things people are worried about.’ But Mr Miliband, speaking to a meeting of the Labour Parliament Party in the Commons last night, dismissed calls for Labour to take a tougher line on immigration. Labour leader Ed Miliband, with the party's new mP Liz McInnes, said Labour could not 'out Ukip Ukip' by hardening up policies on immigration . Ukip leader Nigel Farage (centre) and newly elected Ukip MP Douglas Carswell (right) joined the party's candidate Mark Reckless in the upcoming Rochester by-election - taking place on November 20 . An MP said: ‘He said immigration was obviously an issue, but there’s more to it. He said there was a deeper malaise with the main political parties. ‘If there is an issue around immigration we can’t just out Ukip Ukip. He said our policy was correct and we needed to keep going on at it.’ Another MP at the meeting said Mr Miliband told them it was no good offering ‘quick fixes’ and called on the party to keep pushing Labour’s message on immigration. In a thinly veiled rebuke to Labour MPs calling for the party to talk more about immigration Mr Miliband also told the meeting that ‘describing the problem is not a solution’. A Labour source told MailOnline the party would unveil new measures on immigration in the coming months. He said Labour's policies would be focussed on making sure immigrants were integrated into the community, forced to contribute to the system before claiming benefits and protected from exploitation.","Labour leader told private meeting of MPs the party could not 'out-Ukip Ukip'

"In the same way that earthquakes can reveal hidden secrets about our planet, astronomers are hoping that 'starquakes' will unravel the mysteries surrounding stars. These are huge pulses that travel through stars, and literally rip them apart, sending out a massive amount of energy through space in a short amount of time. The phenomenon takes place in neutron stars, which contain the equivalent mass of half-a-million Earths into a sphere about 12 miles (19.3km) across - roughly the length of Manhattan Island in New York. Scroll down for video . A rupture in the crust of a highly magnetised neutron star, shown here in an artist's rendering, can trigger high-energy eruptions. Fermi observations of these blasts include information on how the star's surface vibrates . Hints of this rare event were picked up in 2009 during a rapid-fire series of pulses on an extremely magnetised neutron star, also known as a magnetar. Now astronomers have again studied this data and confirmed underlying signals that might indicate a starquake on this magnetar that caused it to 'ring like a bell.' 'Fermi's Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) has captured the same evidence from smaller and much more frequent eruptions called bursts,' said Anna Watts, an astrophysicist at the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands . '[This opens] up the potential for a wealth of new data to help us understand how neutron stars are put together.' The starquakes were found in the midst of SGR J1550-5418's 2009 storm after Swift's X-Ray Telescope captured an expanding halo produced by the magnetar's brightest bursts. The rings formed as X-rays from the brightest bursts scattered off of intervening dust clouds. Starquakes are quakes on the surface of a star that literally rip it apart, sending out a huge amount of energy in a short space of time. They are caused by neutron stars, highly dense masses of protons and electrons that have been forced together to form a solid mass of neutrons. Neutron stars form as the result of a giant star going supernova and leaving behind its dense core. The resultant momentum from becoming such a small object sees them spin at an average of 400 rotations per second. As they rotate, the incredibly strong gravitational force of the star counteracts the spin of the star. The former attempts to draw in the equator, while the centrifugal forces resulting from the spin of the star try to push the equator out. Eventually, the tension in the surface reaches such a level that the crust 'snaps' and a huge number of gamma rays and x-rays are released as a stellar quake. As the geometry of the star readjusts, the strong magnetic fields temporarily drop to a lower energy level and the star momentarily lets down its guard. The energy released from inside the star is now free to escape, creating one of the largest known flashes of x-rays in the universe. Source: Space Answers . While typical neutron stars have magnetic fields trillions of times stronger than Earth's, the eruptive activity observed from magnetars requires fields 1,000 times stronger still. Because a neutron star's solid crust is locked to its intense magnetic field, a disruption of one immediately affects the other. The changes trigger a sudden release of stored energy via powerful bursts that vibrate the crust, a motion that becomes imprinted on the burst's gamma-ray and X-ray signals. It takes an incredible amount of energy to convulse a neutron star. The closest comparison on Earth is the 9.5-magnitude Chilean earthquake of 1960, which ranks as the most powerful ever recorded on the standard scale used by seismologists. On that scale, said Professor Watts, a starquake associated with a magnetar giant flare would reach magnitude 23. The 2009 burst storm came from SGR J1550−5418, an object discovered by Nasa's Einstein Observatory, which operated from 1978 to 1981. Located about 15,000 light-years away in the constellation Norma, the magnetar was quiet until October 2008, when it entered a period of eruptive activity that ended in April 2009. At times, the object produced hundreds of bursts in as little as 20 minutes, and the most intense explosions emitted more total energy than the sun does in 20 years. High-energy instruments on many spacecraft, including Nasa's Swift and Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, detected hundreds of gamma-ray and X-ray blasts. Pictured is Nasa's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope,being readied for launch. The Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) in the centre is an array of 14 crystal detectors sensitive to short-lived gamma-ray blasts . Speaking at the Fifth Fermi International Symposium in Nagoya, Japan, Professor Watts said the new study examined 263 individual bursts detected by Fermi's GBM and confirms vibrations in the frequency ranges previously seen in giant flares. 'We think these are likely twisting oscillations of the star where the crust and the core, bound by the super-strong magnetic field, are vibrating together,' she explained. 'We also found, in a single burst, an oscillation at a frequency never seen before and which we still do not understand.' Knowing more about how bursts shake up these stars will give theorists an important new window into understanding their internal structure. 'Right now,' added Professor Watts, 'we are waiting for more bursts - and if we're lucky, a giant flare - to take advantage of GBM's excellent capabilities.'

"Watching a recent episode of the female detective drama Scott And Bailey, I suddenly felt deeply uncomfortable. The heroines of the ITV show — two gutsy, senior, women police officers —were discussing how to solve a crime, while their bumbling male counterparts sat around, gawping helplessly. Whenever the men managed to get a word in edgeways, it was to suggest a course of action that was utterly stupid and they were put in their place by their female superiors. There is something dishonourable about the portrayal of men as completely useless for the purposes of entertainment says Melissa Kite . No doubt this demonstration of ‘girl power’ is intended to make the show appeal to me as a woman, but instead, it made me feel rather queasy. There was something dishonourable about the portrayal of men as completely useless for the purposes of entertainment. Yet the more I flicked through the channels, the more I realised that, increasingly, almost everything on TV — from comedies to reality shows, murder mysteries and even adverts — now features women as the heroines, equipped with a fine brain, while men are depicted as thoughtless buffoons, aggressors, or ineffective idiots. Take a recent KFC advert. A dad and his two offspring are sitting at a table in one of the chain’s restaurants, waiting for Mum to bring their order over. Both children remain engrossed in their phones, as Dad unsuccessfully attempts to get their attention by suggesting activities for the afternoon. Watching a recent episode of the female detective drama Scott And Bailey, Melissa suddenly felt deeply uncomfortable . When Mum returns and makes the same suggestions, naturally both kids answer immediately, leaving Dad looking like a twit. It gets a cheap laugh and might be easy to shrug off, were it not for the fact that any advertiser who tried to achieve sales by belittling women wouldn’t be tolerated. It’s the same story in TV comedy. In the really big hit shows, there seems to be a pretty set formula, whereby the male characters are idiotic, if endearing, fools, saved from themselves by the women. In Friends, for example, the male characters, Ross, Chandler and Joey, are, respectively, two well-meaning but ineffectual geeks and an unthinking lothario, while the female characters, Rachel, Monica and Phoebe, are far more well-rounded and worldly. From Everybody Loves Raymond to Two And A Half Men, the most influential U.S. shows feature flaky men who won’t be serious, or take responsibility for anything. The formula persists in popular British TV. In Gavin And Stacey, buffoonish Smithy, played by writer James Corden, veers between sentimental fool and drunken idiot and is, apparently, incapable of growing up. He’s constantly wrong-footed by his on-off love interest, the formidable Nessa (co-writer Ruth Jones). In family comedy Outnumbered, Pete is the blundering dad who is constantly befuddled by his children. His wife, Sue, is exhausted and long-suffering, but far sharper, shrewder and more capable. The trend begins early. In the wildly popular children’s cartoon show Peppa Pig, the family’s father, Daddy Pig, is a hapless bumbler, while it’s clear Mummy Pig is the boss of the household. What all of these shows have in common is that they exaggerate the uselessness of men. But it’s the insidiousness of this socially-acceptable sexism that’s most concerning. For it’s not overt hatred of men, rather the casual denigration of them, so often done for comic effect. In Friends the male characters are well-meaning but ineffectual geeks and an unthinking lothario, while the female characters are far more well-rounded . It seems belittling men barely registers any more, yet making fun of women — especially joking about violence towards women — is something we’d never stand for. Consequently, comedienne Jo Brand is able to make jokes about men that would never be deemed acceptable the other way around. For example: ‘What’s the way to a man’s heart? Straight through the chest with a kitchen knife.’ And don’t laugh, but there is also an alarming trend for men to be portrayed as sex objects. Gone are the days when a half-naked woman could come on stage in a skimpy, lamé two-piece, smiling inanely, as a magician’s assistant. But the amount of male flesh on display in shows like Strictly Come Dancing is staggering. Yes, the women wear skimpy costumes, too, but when the camera lingers over the naked torsos of dancers like Pasha Kovalev, the whoops from the audience are reminiscent of the Roman amphitheatre. When Gavin Henson danced the Paso Doble topless in series eight, head judge Len Goodman congratulated him on ‘working your assets’, while Alesha Dixon declared: ‘Your body looks amazing, which helps.’ They would never get away with it if they leered over a woman’s physique so blatantly. Is it all harmless fun? I don’t think so. In Spreading Misandry: The Teaching Of Contempt For Men In Popular Culture, Katherine Young and co-author Paul Nathanson warn that this patronising of men is now so pervasive in movies, TV, comic strips and even greetings cards, that it could have ‘disastrous consequences’ for society, and eventually provoke a serious backlash against women. Since the mid-1990s, they argue, men have been increasingly portrayed as evil or inadequate. They have gone so far as to say there is now a culture of ‘misandry’ — literally ‘hatred of men’. When Gavin Henson danced the Paso Doble topless in series eight, head judge Len Goodman congratulated him on ‘working your assets’ which would never be acceptable to say of a woman . ‘Our hypothesis is that, like misogyny once upon a time, misandry has become so deeply embedded in our culture that few people, including men, even recognise it,’ they write. Feminists have rightly fought for an end to men putting women down, but we will surely never improve relations between the sexes by ushering in a new era of sexism that consists of women constantly traducing men. Once you are aware of it, you start noticing how this culture of misandry seems to permeate everything. As I had lunch with a friend recently, she snatched up her ringing phone and began barking a tirade of abuse into it.‘What do you mean, you can’t find their football kit? I don’t have time for this! Show some initiative. I can’t nursemaid you. Don’t call me again.’ I assumed she was having bother on the nanny front, but no — it was her husband, a man who works tirelessly, in a highly-pressurised career, to support her and their children. He was off work that day and had offered to stay at home with the kids so she could go to lunch with me. Comedienne Jo Brand is able to make jokes about men that would never be deemed acceptable the other way around . I wish I could say her diatribe was an isolated incident. I notice more and more that my girlfriends speak to their husbands and boyfriends in a derogatory manner, as if they are somehow inferior. Needless to say, they then complain that they are not ‘manly’ enough in their attitude, or in the bedroom. I have to confess that I’m not altogether innocent. My boyfriend, Will, and I were in Pizza Express the other day, when I snapped at him to hurry up because he couldn’t decide what to order. He walked out, which was hugely embarrassing for me. But I wouldn’t have put up with him talking to me in this obnoxious way, so why should he? I count myself fortunate to have a boyfriend who is an unreconstructed, traditional — even macho — male. What’s particularly worrying is that a lot of my friends do not hesitate in putting their husbands down in front of the children. Surely, in doing so, they teach their daughters to denigrate and disrespect men and make their sons feel emasculated and demoralised. Is it any wonder girls are now outperforming boys at GCSE and A-level? Girls are already ahead in most subjects by the age of five and the gap widens as they get older, the latest research shows. Last year, there were 40,000 more female applicants for university places than male, while women outnumber men by three to two in many universities. There are also more young women entering the top professions such as medicine. Research also suggests a quarter of UK women are now the family breadwinner — five times more than at the start of the Seventies. Female earnings have soared 44 per cent since then, compared with 6 per cent for men. Psychologist Mark Sherman, author of Boys And Young Men: Attention Must Be Paid, says relegating men to supporting roles, such as stay-at-home dad or house-husband, is damaging. ‘Weren’t under-education, under-employment and relegation to the home among the major motivators for the modern women’s movement? Are we parents of sons simply supposed to sit back and say to our boys, “College isn’t essential, but if you do go, maybe you’ll meet a future doctor or lawyer; in fact, maybe you could be her secretary. And, listen, there’s nothing wrong with being a house-husband!” Last year, there were 40,000 more female applicants for university places than male, while women outnumber men by three to two in many universities . ‘Did women working far below their true abilities turn out to be a good thing? Obviously not. Then why should we expect it to be a good thing for men?’ Ultimately, if the background noise of our lives is banter about male inadequacy, while leering at their biceps, it is in no one’s interests — least of all women’s. One of the unintended consequences of belittling men is that we women end up with the sort of men we really don’t like, if truth be told. For, when we are not lampooning men for being idiots, we seem to be attacking them for not being manly enough. We only have ourselves to blame. If we want our men to be in any way exciting, gallant, high-earning, swashbuckling, or, indeed, protective, we have to allow them to keep their dignity and self-respect. Running a man down never turned him into Clint Eastwood.","There is something dishonourable about portraying men as useless .

"A teenager discovered she had cancer after rupturing a tumour while performing an emergency stop during her driving test. Nicole Walker thought she was just nervous when she began experiencing abdominal pains at the beginning of her test when she was 17. But within an hour, the now 21-year-old was being rushed to hospital in Glasgow, where she learned she  in fact had  ovarian cancer. Nicole Walker thought she was suffering from nerves when she prepared to sit her driving test with a store stomach. The then teenager was shocked when she later learned she had ovarian cancer . Miss Walker, who now travels the country raising awareness for teenage cancer, said: 'When I got into the test car I was having quite sore abdominal pains, but I thought it was just anxiety. 'By the time I had finished an hour later I could barely walk. I went straight to the GP who sent me to the hospital,' she told the Sunday Mirror. Now Miss Walker is campaigning to raise teenage cancer awareness . There, doctors revealed she had a large tumour inside her that had ruptured with the force of an emergency stop performed during the test. Three months of chemotherapy followed, on the first day of which the student passed the test after sitting it for the second time. After shaving her head and quitting her sixth form studies, Miss Walker began touring UK schools to raise awareness of the condition among teenagers. She is particularly concerned with spotting the signs early enough to receive proper treatment as doctors failed to spot her condition from the age of 14 when she was diagnosed with stress and a stomach bug after complaining of abdominal pain. 'I don't blame the GP as teenage cancers can be hard to detect,' she said. 'But I want other doctors to read my story and look out for the warning signs. 'I was presenting with all the symptoms: stomach pain, feeling sick but it was only a week before my test when a lump appeared in my abdomen that he referred me to the hospital. 'I was waiting for the appointment when the tumour ruptured.' Every year an estimated 2,500 young people are diagnosed with the disease.

"Amanda Bynes found a soft place to rest amid the turmoil with her parents - a shopping mall couch. The troubled 28-year-old starlet was pictured reclining and apparently asleep on a turquoise, modern-looking loveseat at The Beverly Center in Los Angeles on Thursday. According to TMZ, Amanda was staying with friends last week but has been wandering the streets of West Hollywood with nowhere to go and no money for a hotel room. Amanda appeared to be 'out like a light' while bundled up in a black sweat shirt over a black T-shirt and red track trousers along with comfy slip-on shoes. Scroll down for video . Couch trip: Amanda Bynes found a soft place to rest on Thursday - a shopping mall couch . Amanda's parents, meanwhile, were pictured moving out of their California home following news they are preparing to give up conservatorship of the actress. The troubled actress' welfare and finances were put in the control of her mother Lynn Bynes last week, but now she and her husband Rick Bynes are to file legal documents to hand her care over to someone else ahead of their planned move to Texas. According to TMZ, Amanda's welfare will be in the hands of a mental health professional who specialises in handling people with 'severe mental illnesses', while financial matters will be handled by someone else. Nowhere else to go: The troubled actress was said to be staying with friends last week but has taken to wandering around West Hollywood with apparently no money for a hotel room and a proper bed . Sleepy star: Amanda was apparently 'out like a light... in the middle of the mega mall' Cosy corner: The What A Girl Wants star looked like she wanted to catch up on some sleep . Lynn and Rick - who are relocating from California to be close to their other daughter - are said to hope that transferring the conservatorship will stop the Easy A star from lashing out at them and help repair their relationship with her. Amanda's parents were seen loading a big moving truck with their belongings on Thursday. Rick looked quite somber in a pink sports shirt and blue trousers as he shuffled back and forth from the house. Lynn did her part by carrying smaller items for packing, wearing navy trousers and a grey T-shirt. Moving on: Amanda Bynes' father Rick was seen packing up his California home on Thursday as he and wife Lynn prepare to leave for Texas . Tote the weary load: Lynn Bynes brought a load of belongings to the moving truck . Twitter rant: The former Disney starlet wrote about a number of other things via Twitter on Thursday . 'I'm so mad at my parents': Amanda Bynes furiously took to Twitter venting outrage against her parents Lynn and Rick Wednesday . Amanda's conservatorship attorney David Esquibias hasn't commented on the personal aspect changing, but did reveal her financial affairs are to be put in the charge of an unnamed private trust firm, in order to make them more accessible to the actress, noting the star currently has no stable home or the means to rent an apartment. He told Access Hollywood: 'My goal is to get her permanent adequate housing.' While the next scheduled conservatorship hearing isn't due to take place until February 2015, it is hoped the matter will be resolved by the end of this week. The news comes after Amanda - who was recently released from a psychiatric treatment facility in Pasadena, California after being involuntarily committed for the second time on October 10 - hit out on Twitter and expressed her desire to have a new conservator. She wrote: 'I'm so mad at my parents.' It hasn't been easy: Rick Bynes looked somber while carrying a few more things to pack . Giving up: Amanda's beleaguered folks are moving to Texas to be closer to their other daughter . More access: Amanda's financial affairs will no longer be handled by her parents and are to be put in the charge of an unnamed private trust firm . Amanda vented: 'They are withholding my belongings and money from me so I don't have new clothes or enough money to rent an apartment. 'We aren't speaking. 'So until I get a different conservator ill look terrible because I don't have enough to get new clothes or anything I need (sic)' Serious: The actress seemed to be in the middle of a distressing conversation as she walked through the mall . More selfies: Amanda made her way to a restaurant following her nap at the mall and took more pictures of herself with her cell phone . Touch up: The platinum-haired star applied more lipstick while enjoying a cool beverage . Check it out: Amanda looked picture pretty with her freshly applied coral lip colour . On Thursday, the outrage continued with Amanda tweeting: 'What is wrong with them? 'My lawyer is working to have them fully removed from being my conservator, because they don't deserve control over my money - They are miserable in their life and I will fight to get control of my finances taken away from them! 'I was not given money for a hotel so i have been staying with friends and i didn't get enough sleep last night so I fell asleep on a couch,' Amanda wrote, adding: '@ the beverly center and a paparazzi snuck in and took pictures of me FYI! On the phone: Amanda stepped outside to focus on her phone conversation . Cigarette break: The starlet puffed away on a cigarette while keeping her phone close to her ear . Wayfarer: Amanda was on the move again still clutching her phone and a lit cigarette . 'I hate my parents for still not giving me money for a hotel.' That might explain why Amanda appeared to be sleeping on a couch at the Beverly Center in Los Angeles on Thursday. TMZ claimed that the actress was 'out like a light...in the middle of the mega-mall.' The news site went on to explain that Amanda was staying with friends last week, but has been wandering the streets in West Hollywood with apparently no other place to go. Amanda reportedly has been trying to make arrangements to leave Los Angeles for New York City. 'Her parents have heard that Amanda is asking friends for money to buy a plane ticket to go back to New York. It's really sad that it has disintegrated to this point, but there is little they can do to stop it,' a family insider told RadarOnline.com. In limbo: Amanda (pictured on October 10) has no stable home or the means to rent an apartment but her attorney told Access Hollywood: 'My goal is to get her permanent adequate housing' Amanda exhibited bizarre behaviour during an October visit to New York City that included gyrating against her bodyguard at a clothing store in the Big Apple. The former Nickelodeon star while in New York also fired off tweets accusing her father of molesting her as a child. She was put on a 72-hour psychiatric hold after returning to Los Angeles and it was extended to a two-week hold in mid-October. Resolving the matter: The Bynes' next scheduled conservatorship hearing isn't due to take place until February 2015, but it is hoped the matter will be resolved by the end of this week; they were pictured on Friday .","Amanda was 'out like a light' on a couch at The Beverly Center in Los Angeles .

"A former salesman is facing eviction from his home after his problem with hoarding spiralled out of control. Brian Clenshaw, 52, has filled his flat to the brim with thousands of newspapers, magazines, DVDs, books, coins and stamps. Now his landlord has taken court action to have him thrown out of his house in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, because the clutter presents 'a fire hazard'. Obsessive: Brian Clenshaw has collected thousands of books, DVDs, magazines and coins . Brian believes he suffers from Obsessive Hoarding Syndrome and his condition means he and cannot throw anything away. He says his obsession to keep everything became uncontrollable after the stress of a serious road accident. His landlord A.E.Chattell & Sons has now been granted a ruling by Tunbridge Wells County Court to order Brian to leave. Brian said today he has 'begged for help' with his hoarding problem but has yet to find any support. He said: 'Ever since I was a little boy I was a bit of a hoarder. And I have always been a bit insecure. 'But it was always manageable. It was silly but manageable. But I had a bad accident back in 1997 where I was run over by a ten tonne lorry and I started struggling. 'In 2004 that is when the hoarding took off I was buying all sorts of things from Amazon, book shops you name it - books, DVDs, CDs. 'I started a serious coin collection. I was spending hundreds and hundred of pounds on coins. Still collecting stamps which I have done quite seriously since 1994, but the coins were a new one. 'I had a GP came round in February 2009 to try and sort things out about how we are going to move on for me and the sofa was clear. 'So it has absolutely mushroomed over the last two or three years. I believe it is a subset of OCD called Compulsive Hoarding Syndrome. 'I have been not diagnosed with this but clearly that is something I have got. Facing eviction: Brian Clenshaw faces being homeless this Christmas after his landlord took legal action to have him evicted . 'Daunting': Mr Clenshaw says he is apprehensive about having to find a new home after being told he is being evicted by his landlord . 'It is very, very daunting I accept that the newspapers and magazines have to go, but a lot of my stuff is decent stuff - reference books, coins, stamps, got my bicycle, golf clubs, CD, you name it. 'I cannot just put that in a holdall rucksack. At least I have now got a week hopefully to try and sort out the important things and more importantly find somewhere else to live."" Friend Tim Burchill, 44, a researcher,  said Brian is 'absolutely terrified' of being thrown out on to the streets. He said: 'Everyone has just turned their backs on him - even his family. I just want to give him the support and understanding he deserves. 'Brian recognised he had a problem with hoarding and had started clearing up. But when the agent started taking him to court he felt under pressure and the stress caused him to start again. 'If the letting agent just gave him sixth months more to stay in the flat he would get everything back on track. 'I am working with him to get an official diagnosis of Obsessive Hoarding Syndrome.' Brian has until December 12 to find a new place to live but he says he has little movement left in his pelvis after his accident which makes it difficult to lift things. He has hundreds of newspapers including copies of the Times and Daily Mail as well as stacks of glossy magazines like Maxim. And he has huge piles of DVDs including the BBC Olympics DVD as well as the moretraditional collectors items coins and stamps. Problem: Mr Clenshaw says his hoarding problem got worse after a serious accident . In need of help: Mr Clenshaw says he has had a problem with hoarding since he was a boy but it got worse after he suffered a serious road accident . A spokeswoman for A.E.Chattell & Sons said they took court action as a 'last resort' and added the council has some emergency accommodation available. She said: 'We have embarked on the court process to regain possession from Brian's flat as an absolute last resort. 'There are tenancy issues that Brian is aware of. There are large quantities of stored newspapers and magazines in Brian's flat and these present a significant fire hazard. 'We have offered to clear the flat, but to no avail.

"A troop of 21 German soldiers found entombed in an perfectly preserved First World War shelter have been given a full military burial nearly a century after their deaths. Not a single member of the men's families attended the moving service at a war cemetery in northern France. The soldiers were buried alive in 1918 when a huge Allied shell exploded above the shelter causing it to cave in. Final resting place: A troop of 21 soldiers discovered entombed in an perfectly preserved First World War shelter have been given a full military burial nearly a century after their deaths . Grave: Timbers lining the tunnel where the soldiers were found. They  were buried alive in 1918 when a huge Allied shell exploded above the tunnel causing it to cave in . Last year, French archaeologists stumbled upon the mass grave at Carspach in Alsace, on the former Western Front, during excavation work for a road building project. Many of the remains were found in the same positions the men had been in at the time of the collapse, prompting experts to liken the scene to Pompeii. Now, 95 years later, the soldiers have been laid to rest in a poignant service at the nearby German war cemetery at Illfurth. Discovery: Last year, French archaeologists stumbled upon the mass grave at Carspach in Alsace, on the former Western Front, during excavation work for a road building project . Pompeii: Many of the remains were found in the same positions the men had been in at the time of the collapse, prompting experts to liken the scene to Pompeii . Unearthed: A number of the soldiers were discovered sitting upright on a bench, one was lying in his bed and another was in the foetal position having been thrown down a flight of stairs . Grim: The names of all the deceased soldiers are all known and include Musketeer Martin Heidrich, 20, Private Harry Bierkamp, 22, and Lieutenant August Hutten, 38 . Burial: It is estimated that over 165,000 Commonwealth soldiers are still unaccounted for on the Western Front . Respect: Guests paid their respects by laying white roses at the foot of the graves . Killed: Almost 2,000 German soldiers are buried at Illfurth including the first German soldier to die in the war, Lieutenant Albert Mayer, who was killed on August 2, 1914 . Some 7.5million men lost their lives on the Western Front during World War One. The front was opened when the German army invaded Luxembourg and Belgium in 1914  and then moved into the industrial regions in northern France. In September of that year, this advance was halted, and slightly reversed, at the Battle Of Marne. It was then that both sides dug vast networks of trenches that ran all the way from the North Sea to the Swiss border with France. This line of tunnels remained unaltered, give or take a mile here and a mile there, for most of the four-year conflict. By 1917, after years of deadlock that saw millions of soldiers killed for zero gain on either side, new military technology including poison gas, tanks and planes was deployed on the front. Thanks to these techniques, the Allies slowly advanced throughout 1918 until the war's end in November. Around 150 people including German and French dignitaries, war veterans and serving soldiers attended the hour-long funeral. Two prayers were read before a lone bugler played a haunting rendition of the German equivalent of the Last Post called 'Der gute Kamerad' - The Good Comrade. Guests paid their respects by laying white roses at the foot of the graves. Fritz Kirchmeier, spokesman for the German War Graves Commission, said: 'The service was very simple but dignified and moving. 'Around 150 people attended the service including dignitaries from France and Germany and there was a very friendly atmosphere. 'There were two prayers read and then a trumpeter played the German equivalent of the Last Post. 'We wrote to three or four families who we could track down but sadly there were no family members at the funeral. 'The great granddaughter of one of the men wrote a letter which was read out at the service, however. 'Unfortunately the First World War is almost forgotten in Germany - it is almost entirely overshadowed by the Second World War. 'It was very important to have this funeral for the purpose of closure. 'For these soldiers the book has finally been shut 95 years after their deaths.' The dead soldiers were part a group of 34 from the 6th Company, 94th Reserve Infantry Regiment buried in the blast. Thirteen . bodies were dragged free from the rubble following the attack by French . forces on March 18, 1918, but the remaining bodies had to be left. Located: The 300ft long tunnel was located 18ft beneath the surface near the small town of Carspach in the Alsace region in France . Michael Landolt, the archaeologist leading the dig, said: 'It's a bit like Pompeii. Everything collapsed in seconds and is just the way it was at the time' A . number of the soldiers were discovered sitting upright on a bench, one . was lying in his bed and another was in the foetal position having been . thrown down a flight of stairs. As . well as the bodies, poignant personal effects such as boots, helmets, . weapons, wine bottles, spectacles, wallets, pipes, cigarette cases and . pocket books were also found. Even the skeleton of a goat was found, assumed to be a source of fresh milk for the soldiers. Archaeologists believe the items were so well preserved because hardly any air, water or lights had penetrated the trench. The . names of all the deceased soldiers are all known and include Musketeer . Martin Heidrich, 20, Private Harry Bierkamp, 22, and Lieutenant August . Hutten, 38. Stuck in time: A German newspaper from 1918 lies partly preserved inside the shelter .

"Demolition workers dismantling the Costa Concordia cruise liner have found the body of an Indian waiter who was the last missing victim of the shipwreck. Russel Rebello, who was working on the ship when it hit rocks and sank off the Tuscan coast in January 2012, had been the only person missing after the disaster whose body had not been found. Carabinieri commander Captain Massimo Pittaluga told the Associated Press the body was discovered by workers clearing debris from the ship in a passenger's cabin on the eighth deck. Scroll down for video . Last victim: Russel Rebello was working on the Costa Concordia when it hit rocks and sank off Tuscany . He said the victim was wearing a shirt that contained an identification card for missing crew member Russel Rebello. A Coast Guard spokesman in the northern port city of Genoa, where the 957ft-long (290m-long) hulk was towed for scrap in July, told Reuters a body found on the ship was 'assumed to be the last victim, Russel Rebello.' In a Facebook message, Mr Rebello's brother Kevin Rebello confirmed the discovery of his brother's remains, thanking 'all those who prayed and believed that one day he would be found.' He said a DNA test would be performed before putting his brother to rest 'with honour,' adding simply: 'India, we are coming.' In August, authorities announced they had found remains on the ship and would test them to see if they belonged to Rebello.

"Muslim pupils must study two religions under government plans to tackle extremism in schools following the Trojan Horse plot. Changes to religious studies qualifications are expected to be set out by ministers next week when the subject criteria for GCSEs is published. Faith schools are likely to see the biggest impact as they can currently choose to teach their own religion and disregard others. Under new government plans to tackle extremism in schools, Muslim pupils will have to study two religions . As well as studying at least two religions, pupils will also be expected to debate moral dilemmas in the context of religious beliefs in class. The modifications to lessons comes after the alleged Trojan Horse plot by hardline Muslims to infiltrate schools in Birmingham. It was originally sparked by a leaked letter in March this year - now widely believed to be a hoax - which alleged to be from Islamists in the city plotting to seize control of a number of school governing bodies. Birmingham City Council revealed a month later that it had received 'hundreds' of allegations of similar school takeover plots - some dating back 20 years. Tahir Alam, chairman of the Park View Education Trust which runs six schools in the city, resigned after he was found to have written a detailed blueprint in 2007 for the radical 'Islamisation' of secular state schools. The government hopes by tweaking religious studies lesson criteria it will help tackle cultural isolationism and extremism. But despite this, schools will be able to decide how much teaching time to give each faith - so pupils could spend three quarters of the course studying one faith and just a quarter on the other. Changes  are expected to be set out by ministers next week when the subject criteria for GCSEs is published . Park View School was one of those that was at the centre of the Trojan Horse plot by hardline Muslims to infiltrate schools in Birmingham . Teachers will also have to give sharper focus to the study of faith and steer away from the current method of dividing studies into philosophy and ethics. While teenagers will be expected to answer questions on ethics with reference to religious beliefs. The new syllabus will also have an extra option that places more emphasis on the study of religious texts, practices and sources of authority. However, A-level students will continue to be able to study only one religion if they choose under the new criteria. The amendments have been broadly welcomed by the Church of England. Reverend Nigel Genders, the Church of England's chief education officer, told The Times: 'Studying two religions with a further detailed text based study for one of the religions at GCSE will promote depth and breadth and equip students to be religiously literate in today's world.' Andrew Copson, chief executive of the British Humanist Association, also told the paper: 'It is hugely important that all young people learn about the full range of different religious and non-religious beliefs that are common in society today. 'Such learning makes a vital contribution to respect and tolerance of individuals with different beliefs.' Mr Copson added that the change is welcome progress but does not go as far as he would have liked. Sir Michael Wilshaw said the plot was 'planned and orchestrated' attempt to control school boards . The Trojan Horse plot first came to light earlier this year, when a letter emerged outlining an alleged a plot by Muslim hardliners to drive moderate headteachers out of schools. The letter prompted Department for Education inspectors to go into Park View School in Birmingham along with its sister schools, Golden Hillock and Nansen. Whistleblowers at Park View claimed the school was in the hands of a group of extremists who had infiltrated its governing body. It is alleged girls at the school were forced to sit at the back of the classroom and non-Muslim pupils forced to teach themselves at the state school. The letter prompted separate ongoing investigations by both the Department for Education (DfE) and Ofsted in to the school and several others in the area. Following inspections, Sir Michael Wilshaw told MPs in July that there had been a 'planned and orchestrated' plot to radicalise pupils in schools in the city. He told the Education Select Committee said: 'I spoke to eight or nine head teachers. They believed it was planned and orchestrated. 'They believed people got together and decided which schools to target. They believed there was a strategy to infiltrate governing bodies. 'They believed governing boards couldn't take place in the normal way. They believed all that was planned and orchestrated. This was all in Birmingham.' When asked by MPs if pupils had been radicalised in the schools, Sir Michael replied: 'We didn't see that. The issue of extremism was outside of our remit.' The Ofsted chief inspector told MPs: 'What we did see was the promotion of a culture, which if that promotion had continued would have exposed these children to extremism.'","Changes to religious studies expected to be set out by ministers next week .

"Watchdog Ofgem has criticised energy companies for their poor dealing of customer complaints . Ofgem has written to energy companies demanding they take action on poor handling of customer complaints. The regulator's chief executive has sent letters to the 'big six' and smaller and independent suppliers about the 'industry-wide failure' to handle complaints to an acceptable standard. It follows research by Ofgem that found more than half of those who had complained - 57 per cent of domestic customers and 52 per cent of small businesses - were not satisfied with how their supplier handled the problem. Furthermore, in almost half of cases where the supplier considered the case resolved, the customer did not. Ofgem said satisfaction with Npower and Scottish Power had fallen particularly markedly, from 36 per cent to 21 per cent and from 44 per cent to 20 per cent respectively, with only SSE managing to maintain levels of satisfaction found two years ago. Earlier this year Ofgem opened an investigation into Npower's 'prolonged customer service failings', the first under its new standards of conduct which state that suppliers must treat consumers fairly. In today's letter, Ofgem warned companies to improve the speed of resolving complaints, communicate better with customers during the process and be more proactive in finding a solution. The letter read: 'The results are unacceptable. I am therefore drawing attention publicly to these findings to leave you in no doubt about the need to act quickly to improve matters. 'I expect you to provide a public response to the issues raised in this letter.' The regulator said many customers were now responding to suppliers' poor service by switching, with almost one in two customers having either already switched or planning to do so as a result of their complaints experience. Ofgem chief executive Dermot Nolan said: 'These satisfaction scores are frankly awful. Npower and Scottish Power have seen satisfaction with their customer service fall markedly . 'Almost all energy suppliers need to improve their complaints handling as a matter of urgency. There are real business benefits to good complaints handling schemes, and it shouldn't need a regulator to tell companies about the importance of this. 'Suppliers must now tell their customers what steps they will be taking to put things right. We are already formally investigating Npower about complaints handling and other customer service issues, and this should send a strong signal to all suppliers that, where necessary, we will take action.' Ofgem said it was planning to bring forward the next survey of complainants to see whether the necessary improvements had happened and decide if more regulatory action was needed. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: 'It shouldn't need involvement from Ofgem for energy companies to get the basics right. We found energy companies have hit rock bottom, with woeful service and dreadful complaints handling. 'This situation has been going on for far too long and it's little wonder that consumer trust is so low. Suppliers need to respond with immediate improvements, not wait for the results of the Competition and Market Authority's investigation.' Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: 'Energy prices are up by a third since 2010 and people are now paying well over a thousand pounds a year to heat and light their homes. 'Energy is a basic essential for every household so firms need to do everything they can do get their service right and if something does go wrong, do their utmost to fix it straight away. 'Trust in the industry will be never be restored if suppliers can't get a grip on complaints handling. Ofgem should investigate firms where their handling of complaints, and the cause of them, could be breaking industry rules.' Energy tariff prices are in a constant merry-go-round with suppliers battling to pinch customers - you - from each other. Shrewd . consumers can take advantage of this by doing exactly that - reviewing . deals every six months to a year to ensure they are on THE cheapest . deal. Even moving every other year will save you significant amounts. If . you are one of the millions of people who have NEVER switched (i.e. stuck with your original supplier), then you will DEFINITELY save a big . chunk of cash, possibly as much as £300 a year. Remember, suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs so if you're ready to switch, it will certainly pay to do so. Don't forget, prices . are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you . will depend where you live. You only need to be interested in the tariff . that is going to be cheapest where you live, so do your own comparison . to find the best price.

"League Two leaders Wycombe recovered from going behind after just two minutes to eventually beat 10-man Southend 4-1 at Adams Park. Jack Payne put the visitors in front but a double from Matt McClure, plus goals from Paris Cowan-Hall and Joe Jacobson, turned the match around, with the dismissal of Jerome Binnom-Williams also giving Wanderers a boost.

"It’s awful news. In my long experience and years in football I cannot recall such an occasion. It’s bad. Since I joined the club in 1971 and before then, Hereford were well run by local businessmen with the interests of the club at heart. It was always one of the best-run clubs in non-League football. They attracted bigger crowds and bigger names — the man who brought me in was the great John Charles. But for one reason or another it’s gone away from that in the last few years. It is really sad. I’m a member of the Supporters’ Trust and I try to keep on top of what is going on — it’s not been nice to follow.

What I hope happens now is that the club is eventually passed into the hands of the Supporters’ Trust. It can work when you do it that way. I certainly can’t see a shining knight coming in.

"An Alabama jail has a history of medical negligence so serious that at least three seriously ill inmates have died while incarcerated at the facility, claims a series of lawsuits filed in recent weeks. The suits claim officials at Madison County Jail withheld medical treatment from inmates despite obvious signs that each was critically ill. What's more, the suits allege officials did it just to save a buck. 'They wait and wait and wait and hope it goes away. That's a formula for killing people,' civil rights attorney Hank Sherrod told CNN. Died of gangrene: Deundrez Woods died in Madison County jail in Alabama in 2013 after authorities let a foot infection get so out of hand it killed him, claims a shocking lawsuit . Indifferent medical staff? Nikki Listau died after alcohol withdraw caused her to fall off a bunk an break bones including a femur and was left unattended by medical staff, the suit claims . Sherrod is representing the families of three inmates who died while at Madison County jail's medical-watch area instead of in a hospital receiving medical treatment, where the suit claims they should have been. Sherrod's most shocking claims surround the youngest of the deceased, 19-year-old Deundrez Woods. Woods was booked in June 2013 on shoplifting and assault charges. For weeks, court filings say, the teen seemed fine. But then an infection on his foot became so extreme that it began to have a stench. At first, all the care he received was a hose down from the guards. Not until 'Woods was confused, hallucinating and unable to communicate with correction and medical personnel,' was he taken to the medical unit of the jail, the lawsuit reads. He died of a blood clot from his gangrenous foot 15 days later, reports CNN. During that time, the suit alleges he was left naked and alone in a cell with no water where he didn't eat. 'They just watched him,' Sherrod said. 'They were happy to let him lie there ... totally indifferent to what was really going on.' Rather save a buck? Three lawsuits claim that Madison County Jail in Alabama would rather save a few dollars than pay for critically ill inmates' medical treatment . Sherrod claims the same was true months before for 60-year-old Nikki Listau and two months later for Tanisha Jefferson, 30. Listau was booked on harassment charges in March 2010. Her ensuing alcohol withdrawal was so bad that she had a seizure that caused her to fall off her bunk during the night in a medical watch cell, the suit claims. Never saw a hospital: Tanisha Jefferson complained repeatedly of severe abdominal pain that ended up being a fatal bowel obstruction, the suit sasys . She broke a femur and several ribs during the fall, says the suit, Her court hearing was canceled,, but she was not taken to a hospital. Two hours later the suit says Listau was found unconscious and she died the following day. Jefferson's death came on October 31, 2013 following an arrest for harassment. She first complained of severe abdominal pain and constipation on October 19. Her only medical treatment was a prescription for laxatives before her death, her lawsuit states, despite repeated pleas to jail staff that she feared for her life. 'If I die, it's on y'all,'  the mother of three allegedly told jailers. The suit says that's precisely what happened due to lack of proper medical treatment when she died of a major bowel obstruction . 'What connects them all is that all of these people were in the medical-watch area, supposedly under the care of nurses,' said Sherrod. County attorney Jeff Rich says all three cases are being vigorously defended. The county has declined to comment further on the pending litigation. The suits seek compensatory and punitive damages and legal fees for the families of the three deceased.","A suit filed on behalf of the families of three dead inmates alleges criminally neglectful officials at the Madison County Jail are at fault for their deaths .

"A popular charity fundraiser who made hundreds of thousands of people laugh with his internet videos has been killed in a car crash, police have said. Andrew Corfield, 39, died following the collision at 7.30pm yesterday in Hemlington, Middlesbrough. An 18-year-old was arrested afterwards on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and stealing a car. A witness claimed that after the crash the man 'got out of the car and jumped over a back fence and ran off'. Andrew Corfield died at the crash scene yesterday with locals later saying it was a 'horrible day for Hemlington' Mr Corfield's daughter Alice, 17, who was a passenger in her father's vehicle, was rushed to James Cook University Hospital following the collision between Mr Corfield's silver Ford Fiesta Zetec and a Hyundai Santa Fe. She is in a critical condition. Locals this evening described Mr Corfield as a 'lovely bloke' and said his death was a 'horrible day for Hemlington'. Mr Corfield, a crane driver, raised funds for the Lullaby Trust following the cot death of his baby son Jack in 1995. He completed the Loch Ness marathon last year despite a painful knee injury and raised more than £6,000. The dock worker also took part in a parachute jump for Teenage Cancer Trust after his eldest daughter, Amy, suffered ovarian cancer in 2010. Mr Corfield created the popular Boro Pat videos, where the children's cartoon character Postman Pat was overdubbed with a filthy dialogue spoken in a thick Teesside accent. The spoof videos have been watched hundreds of thousands of times online. Flowers were left at Cass House Road after the crash with one message saying: 'What a waste of life.' Tributes to Mr Corfield have been paid on Facebook and flowers have been laid on Cass House Road where the fatal crash happened yesterday evening. One tribute read: 'A part of Hemo's soul died here. What a waste of life.' Another said: 'Your memories will never fade kid.' A witness of the fatal crash at the junction of Cass House Road and Fordyce Road said: 'It was really horrible. 'It looked like the lad was going too fast and as soon as the crash happened, he got out of the car and jumped over a back fence and ran off. He added: 'It is a horrible day for Hemlington.' Another said: 'We heard three loud bangs, and came outside. 'You see young lads driving up and down here all the time, speeding. But nothing has ever happened like this.' Neighbours who lived near Mr Corfield in Hemlington described him as a 'lovely bloke' who 'everyone round here knew'. The father of two created the X-rated Boro Pat videos with his friend, Neil McLoughlin. Mr Corfield said of the spoof videos: 'I think the Middlesbrough sense of humour is the best in the world because it comes from people who don't have a lot but just get on with it and enjoy life.' Mr Corfield was married to Lisa, and also father to their children Owen and Amy, and grandfather to Amy's daughter, Lucy.

The magnificent property is anticipated to fetch close to $10 million at auction on November 10, and is evidently inspired by classic properties from the sun-bathed areas of LA. Built in the Spanish Mission architectural style that Los Angles is so well known for, the house has been listed by the medical entrepreneur Robert Gregg and his wife, Elaine .

Built in the Spanish Mission architectural style that Los Angeles is so well known for, the house has been listed by the medical entrepreneur Robert Gregg and his wife, Elaine. The Greggs bought the Tivoli Avenue residence in 1998 for $2.14 million from Anne Melkman, though the house was originally built for George Eckblade, managing director of Wrigley's Australia, and his wife, Helen. The Spanish Mission style was influenced by traditional American Spanish homes, and enjoyed an architectural revival in America throughout the later 19th century, known as Mission Revival architecture. Within Australia the movement was known as Spanish Colonial Revival architecture, or Inter-War Spanish Mission, and became popular in Victoria and NSW, especially between 1925 and 1939. Bondi, Manly, Elizabeth Bay, Bellevue Hill, Biscaya and Rose Bay feature many Spanish Mission style houses built by Australian architects who were convinced that Mediterranean styles would suit the country's lifestyle. Sydney's semi-Mediterranean climate made it an epicentre for the lavish Spanish Mission homes, including this Tivoli Avenue residence. The two-storey residence opens to an elegant entrance hall leads to a large formal sitting room . The Spanish Mission style was influenced by traditional American Spanish homes, and enjoyed an architectural revival in America throughout the later 19th century, known as Mission Revival architecture, and in Australia as Spanish Colonial Revival architecture . The large 14-person dining room lends itself to both formal and casual dining, with a 1000-bottle bespoke wine cellar downstairs . The state of the art gas kitchen is perfect for catering for formal occasions or large family dinners . Stafford bridged the two styles, operating between Australia and the US, evident in the design of the property which meshes Hollywood glamour with iconic Harbour views. Original touches of the Spanish Mission style include vaulted ceilings, arched windows, juliet balconies and a Spanish terra cotta tiled roof. Much like the original style often featured white or yellow cream finish over brick walls, the Rose Bay residence stuns with white washed stucco walls and a light wine coloured exterior which offsets the expanse of native greenery on the property. Completely restored in 1999 by John Normyle, who won the 2001 Heritage Award for the project, the Greggs later added the pool and self-contained guest cabana. The home has also been the location for fashion shoots, used by internationally lauded Australian jewellery designer Samantha Wills for a Moroccan-inspired collaboration launch with ModelCo. The main bedroom suite is both luxurious and expansive with matching dressing rooms for a couple. Two more bedrooms also have ensuites, on the same level as a lush sitting room with stunning views .

"The woman said she spent years feeling ashamed about the attack and blaming herself for what happened. Picture posed by model . A victim of sex abuse claims Barnardo's blamed her for the assault she suffered at the hands of a gang of men inside a flat owned by the children's charity. The woman, now 37, said Barnardo's sent a letter about the abuse she endured when she was 16, claiming she had placed herself in a dangerous situation. It said the incident could have been avoided if she 'had not been party to the antics of a group of young men from the local neighbourhood.' The letter, written by a project worker at the charity, said the teenager had been unable to respond in a 'constructive way' because she had taken drugs and been drinking alcohol. Barnardo's, which has recently condemned institutions which blame children for their own abuse, said it is investigating what happened when the letter was sent to the woman in 1993. The woman said the sexual abuse happened in a flat in Leeds, owned by Barnardo's, shortly after she had left a children's home. She said she was attacked by a group of British Pakistani men who befriended her and groomed her, plying her with drink and drugs. She told Sky News: 'I woke up and I didn't have any clothes on and there were half naked men around. 'I knew I'd been assaulted. I didn't know to what extent, I didn't know if I'd been raped or what, really.' The woman stayed in the flat for six months, suffering a stream of abuse which got worse and included rape. She said she felt ashamed about what had happened, blaming herself. The letter sent to her said: 'The situation could have been avoided if [she] had not been party to the antics of a group of young men."" It added: 'Having consumed a quantity of alcohol and three valium tablets [she] was not able to maintain control or respond to the situation in a constructive and cohesive way.' The letter concluded that the teenager was to stay at the flat, despite subsequent visits by the men. It also said there were still concerns that she was able to act responsibly, placing herself in danger. The headquarters of children's charity Barnardo's . The woman, who cannot be named but has decided to make the letter public, said she felt 'absolute disgust' for Barnardo's, for 'knowing this happened, for blaming me for it happening and doing nothing about it.' A statement from Barnardo's said: 'The view that any child is responsible for their own sexual assault is wrong and totally unacceptable. 'This woman has been very brave in bringing this issue to light. It must have been a very difficult and distressing step to have taken after so many years. 'Barnardo's takes this very seriously and we will fully investigate.' Leeds City Council said it would also be looking into the case and said it was 'confident' it would be managed very differently if something similar was to occur today. The revelation comes as Norfolk Police Chief Constable Simon Bailey said there could be 'many more' cases of child sex abuse like that uncovered in Rotherham where at least 1,400 children were sexually exploited .","Victim has spoken about sexual abuse she suffered by gang of men when 16 .

"Hundreds of Baltimore fans have formed a queue stretching back half-a-mile to swap their Ray Rice jerseys for other stars' in reaction to footage that showed the NFL star punching his then-fiancée unconscious. People started descending on the M&T Bank Stadium at 4am today after the club agreed to relieve fans of the #27 shirts in exchange for replica jerseys. The event, taking place from 8am to 3pm today and tomorrow at the official team store, is a desperate bid by the NFL to claw back public respect following claims bosses turned a blind eye to Rice's domestic abuse. Scroll down for video . Who needs an iPhone? Fans queued for hours today to swap their Ray Rice jerseys for another . Hours: Crowds descended on the M&T Bank Stadium at 4am ready for the doors to open at 8am today . The running back was dropped from the Ravens' squad last week and has been indefinitely suspended by the NFL after TMZ published CCTV footage of him punching Janay Palmer in a lift then dragging her out unconscious. Originally, he was banned for just two games after footage emerged of the second half of the incident in February, showing Rice dragging Palmer out the elevator. Outraged fans have now blasted bosses at the Ravens and the NFL for failing to thoroughly investigate the attack. But today, they will be given the option to reject the disgraced star. Swap: This fan switched his allegiance from disgraced Ray Rice to linebacker Elvis Dumervil at the exchange . Discarded: This is a pile of crumpled up Ray Rice jerseys shoved in boxes after they were returned by fans . Offer: The Ravens' bosses handed queue members tickets for an exchange, which will continue tomorrow . Bleak: There was a sullen atmosphere outside the stadium following the news of Rice's domestic abuse . Announcing the exchange this week, the squad released a series of guidelines for fans. Jerseys must be officially licensed by the NFL, manufactured by Nike or Reebok, and purchased at the Ravens Team Store. Exchanges are limited to one per person and each will be given a replica Nike jersey. The move mirrors a similar one last year by the New England Patriots, which offered fans the opportunity to swap their Aaron Hernandez jerseys after he was charged with murder. Disgraced: The Baltimore Ravens offered the exchange which will run today and tomorrow in a bid to claw back public support after the running back was filmed punching his then-fiancée unconscious in an elevator . Popular: Rice was a favourite among fans but he has now been dropped from the squad and suspended by NFL . Incident: The Ravens and the NFL were accused of failing to properly investigate Rice's abuse of Janay Palmer . Hernandez was arrested and charged with the first-degree murder of Odin Lloyd in June last year. Lloyd was shot to death June 17 near Hernandez' home in North Attleborough, Mass. Since Rice's suspension, a number of other NFL players have been embroiled in abuse cases. Adrian Peterson was indicted last week with the charge of reckless injury to a child after being accused of whipping his son with a switch. He has now been deactivated by the Vikings indefinitely but there is as yet no news of a jersey swap.","Baltimore ravens offered fans chance to get rid of #27 Ray Rice jerseys .

"A Utah judge will get his first chance in December to hear the evidence against a woman accused of killing six of her seven newborns and storing all of their bodies in her garage. Attorneys for Megan Huntsman, 39, decided Monday not to waive their right to a preliminary hearing. That proceeding has been set for December 11. Megan Huntsman, accused of killing six of her newborn babies and storing their bodies in her garage, appears in court Monday in Provo, Utah . Attorneys for Megan Huntsman, 39, decided Monday not to waive their right to a preliminary hearing . At the conclusion of the hearing, a judge will decide if there is sufficient proof to send the case to trial. Huntsman is in jail on $6 million bail, charged with six counts of first-degree murder. She has not yet entered a plea. She made a brief appearance in court Monday, but didn't speak. Investigators believe Huntsman was addicted to methamphetamine and didn't want to care for the babies . Police tape the front of the house where seven infant bodies were discovered and packaged in in Pleasant Grove, Utah . Huntsman's estranged husband discovered the infants' bodies on April 12 while cleaning out the home . Huntsman's estranged husband discovered the infants' bodies on April 12 while cleaning out the home they had shared in Pleasant Grove, Utah, a city of about 35,000 south of Salt Lake City. Police say Huntsman strangled or suffocated the infants from 1996 to 2006, and that a seventh baby found in her garage was stillborn. Investigators believe Huntsman was addicted to methamphetamine and didn't want to care for the babies. DNA results have revealed that all seven babies were full term and that her now-estranged husband, Darren West, was the biological father of the infants. Huntsman lived with West during the 10-year period the children were killed, but he is not considered a suspect in the deaths. He went to prison in 2006 and spent more than eight years behind bars after pleading guilty to drug charges. West made the grisly discovery while cleaning out the garage. He called police to report finding a dead infant in a small white box covered with electrician's tape. Six other bodies were found wrapped in shirts or towels inside individual boxes in the garage after police obtained a search warrant.","Megan Huntsman, 39, is accused of murdering six of her children over a 10-year period .

"Minnesota Vikings star Adrian Peterson avoided jail time on Tuesday in a plea agreement reached with prosecutors to resolve his child abuse case. The 29-year-old running back pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge of reckless assault, a deal that allows him to avoid a felony child-abuse conviction. Peterson has agreed to pay a $4,000 fine, serve 80 hours of community service, take parenting classes and will spend the next two years on probation. Scroll down for more . All smiles: Vikings running back Peterson (seen in court with wife Ashley Brown on Tuesday) has reached a plea agreement that will allow him to plead no contest to misdemeanor reckless assault - and avoid jail time . Peterson and his attorney Rusty Hardin, left, said he is looking forward to getting back to having a relationship with the boy who he hadn't been allowed to see while the case was pending . 'I want to say I truly regret this incident. I stand here and I take full responsibility for my actions. I love my son more than any one of you can even imagine,' said Peterson outside the court in Conroe, Texas. While the case was pending, he was not allowed to have contact with his son. Peterson and his attorney said he is looking forward to getting back to having a relationship with the boy. 'Adrian wants to get on with his life, have a relationship with his son and get back to playing football,' Peterson's attorney, Rusty Hardin, said. Now that the legal case is over, the NFL has a big decision to make whether to reinstate Peterson or whether to suspend him without pay. Peterson - the 12th highest paid player in the league - has been on paid leave from the Vikings under a special exemption from the NFL commissioner to take care of his legal problems. It was not immediately clear how the plea deal would affect his playing status. Now that the legal case is over, the NFL has a big decision to make whether to reinstate Peterson or whether to suspend him without pay. He could be reinstated for the Viking’s next game against the Bears on November 16 . 'We will review the matter, including the court record, and then make a determination on his status,' NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said. 'We cannot provide a timetable.' Peterson has already missed eight games, so unless the NFL suspends him for more than eight games, he could be reinstated for the Viking’s next game against the Bears on November 16. Peterson was indicted in September on a felony charge of injury to a child for using a wooden switch to discipline his 4-year-old son earlier this year in suburban Houston. The All-Pro running back says he never intended to harm his son and was disciplining him in the same way he had been as a child growing up in East Texas. The boy suffered cuts, marks and bruising to his thighs, back and on one of his testicles, according to court records. The case revived a debate about corporal punishment, which is on the decline in the U.S. but still widely practiced in homes and schools. Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson arrives at court in Conroe, Texas, on Tuesday . If convicted of felony child abuse, he could have faced up to two years in prison and a $10,000 fine. A tentative trial date of Dec. 1 had been set in Peterson's case. Last month, a visiting judge denied a request by prosecutors to remove Case as judge in the case. Prosecutors had accused Case of being biased against them and wanted a new judge appointed. The plea deal made moot a pending motion by prosecutors to revoke Peterson's $15,000 bond for alleged marijuana use. Corporal punishment is legal in every state. The Texas Attorney General's Office notes that belts and brushes ‘are accepted by many as legitimate disciplinary “tools,'"" but ‘electrical or phone cords, boards, yardsticks, ropes, shoes, and wires are likely to be considered instruments of abuse.’ Texas law says the use of non-deadly force against someone younger than 18 is justified if a parent or guardian ‘reasonably believes the force is necessary to discipline the child or to safeguard or promote his welfare.’ Peterson (above with one of his sons)  was arrested and posted $15,000 bond on September 12 on a charge of injury to a child .","Peterson has avoided jail after a judge accepted a plea deal  in his child abuse case on Tuesday .

"Kylie Bretag has been locked up in a detention centre in Mexico since October 20 . The Australian woman who was on 'the trip of a lifetime' to celebrate her birthday and graduation when she was locked up in a Mexican detention centre will soon be moved to the country’s capital. Kylie Bretag has been kept in ‘appalling’ conditions at a detention centre in Tenosique, a small Mexican town north of Guatemala, for the last six days after travelling in the country without a visa. There is no set date for her release but her mother Colleen Bretag told the Today Show on Monday morning that her daughter is being moved to Mexico City on Tuesday. ‘She doesn't know where she will go from there, she's very afraid she will be held there in detention for another week,’ Colleen said. The 30-year-old, from Melbourne, was arrested by Mexican officials while passing a checkpoint on a bus on October 20 after she was caught without a visa. Colleen said that although the embassy in Australia have been ‘terrific’ they can’t tell the distressed family much. ‘In the last week we've received communication from Kylie via email. Her phone was taken off her,’ she said. Scroll down for video . The 30-year-old (right) was meant to meet her close friend Natalie Wayt (left) in Cancun when she was arrested . Ms Wayt said her friend had crossed the border from San Diego to Mexico on foot after hearing that it was cheaper than flying online. She was then arrested while on a bus in Tenosique, north of Guatemala . Colleen said she has ‘no idea’ about her daughter’s legal situation but ‘the thing that upset [Kylie] the most is that she hasn't even had a shower’. Natalie Wayt, Ms Bretag's close friend who was on her way to meet the recent communications graduate in Cancun before she was locked up, told Daily Mail Australia that Ms Bretag had crossed the border between San Diego and Mexico on foot in order to save money. 'Some travel websites says that if you want to save money go to San Diego and walk the border. 'It's actually very common, people from the US do it all the time. They just go down there and have lunch and then come back,' Ms Wayt said . Colleen Bretag told the Today Show on Monday morning that her daughter is being moved to Mexico City on Tuesday . Ms Bretag was on 'the trip of a lifetime' to celebrate both her 30th birthday and graduation from her communications degree . Ms Wayt said her friend had asked an official to stamp her passport when entering the country but, 'he didn't say anything, just waved her on' ‘She even asked an official down there, because she had her passport in her hand, she asked him where she could get it stamped and he didn't say anything, just waved her on. There was a massive language barrier. 'She's committed a crime, but the punishment for it is deportation and she hasn't been deported yet. All she wants to do is go home.' Until now, Ms Bretag had been keeping in contact with Ms Wayt and her family at home via a mobile phone. As of Sunday morning Australian time, the phone – her only way of contacting the outside world - was removed from her possession. There is no set date for her release of relocation as centre staff continue to make 'broken promises' Ms Bretag is being kept in a crowded cell with up to 20 other women, no clean water to bathe with and is sleeping on a thin mat on the floor . 'She told me: ""I just want to go home, I'm living a nightmare"",' Ms Wayt said. Both her mother Colleen and Ms Wayt said staff at the detention centre continue to promise Ms Bretag that she will be deported and relocated on certain dates. 'We've been liaising with the Mexican consulate often, but they just say to us ""she's going on such and such day"" and that just hasn't happened. We're just waiting, waiting, waiting,' Colleen said. The most recently set date for her departure is in two days' time but neither her family nor friends are convinced by the empty promises. 'There's no bus ticket, no plane ticket – that's just what the consultant has been told. I'd like to think that she will be leaving on Monday but I don't know what to believe any more,' Ms Wayt said. Ms Wayt has begun a media campaign in order to ensure and speed up her friend's release from detention . In the meantime, Ms Bretag is being held alongside more than 20 other women and dozens of children. Sleeping on one of the numerous small mats that line the ground in a row on the floor, Ms Bretag told her friend that she is yet to bathe in the facility as she has no privacy and the shower 'is a box with a hole in it' with the water being supplied in buckets filled with recycled water from the sinks. 'But today was good,' Colleen said, 'because she managed to be let outside for 5 minutes'. 'We just all feel sick and really worried about not being able to communicate with her – but all we could say was 'we love you and stay calm'. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is providing consular assistance Ms Bretag, the Today Show reported.","Kylie Bretag has been locked up at a detention centre in Tenosique, a small Mexican town north of Guatemala .

"Passengers on board a Malindo Air flight on Monday were left terrified when its oxygen masks deployed and the plane was forced to make an emergency landing in Bangkok. The five-hour flight from New Delhi to Kuala Lumpur was aborted and the plane diverted to Thailand after the cabin began to depressurise as it flew through a storm. Those on board said a child vomited in her oxygen mask and an elderly man fell in the toilet ‘when the plane began losing altitude’.

"This is the incredible moment a fearless mother bravely wrestled with a carjacker who tried to steal her Audi when she left the engine running for a few seconds. Deborah Fielding had left the car to open the barrier at her work in Oldham, Greater Manchester, when the would-be thief jumped in the driver's seat and tried to make off. But when she saw the thief reversing away in her car, the 52-year-old instantly raced over and began grappling with the man, refusing to let him leave. Scroll down for video . Deborah Fielding had left her vehicle for just a few seconds when the would-be thief jumped in the driver's seat and began reversing off - but she wasted no time racing to fight him off, despite tripping over . When Mrs Fielding sees the man attempt to drive away, she throws herself towards the car and tries to prise open the door . The man keeps trying to reverse, but Mrs Fielding clings onto the driver's door and begins wrestling with him . In the extraordinary footage, which was captured on CCTV, Mrs Fielding is even seen tripping over as she races towards the vehicle to fight off the man. But, determined to reach him, she immediately gets up and throws herself towards the car, where she begins prising open the door. Brave: Deborah Fielding refused to give up . As the man tries to reverse, Mrs Fielding is seen clinging onto the door, as it slams open and shut against her. Despite the man fighting back, the determined mother is seen wrestling with him as she hangs half in and half out of the car. At one point, the man reverses so forcefully that Mrs Fielding is almost dragged under the front wheels. But Mrs Fielding soon regains her footage and carries on clinging to the vehicle as drives back and forth several times. The astonishing grapple continues for at least 30 seconds before the man eventually leaves the car and runs away from the scene. Today her daughter Louise Fielding said: 'She's a little warrior. 'She's bruised all over but she wouldn't let go. she was saying ""It's my car, you can't have it"". 'Her passport was in her bag on the back seat because she was going on holiday this afternoon so she was determined not to let him get away with it.' The clip was taken from security CCTV at Rhinos Gym, which is near to Green Care Pest Control, where the incident took place. Miss Fielding, who works for the pest control company where her mother is managing director, said her mum was left 'badly bruised' and 'shaken' by the incident. She said: 'Mum had gone into the office a little early because she was going on holiday to Tenerife later today and wanted to get some work done. 'I don't know whether the guy was watching the entrance to the car park or was an opportunist, but he took advantage when she got out of the car to open the barrier to leap in. 'She told me she saw him and the adrenaline kicked in, she would not let the car go, she was like, ""That's my car, you're not having it"" especially as it had her passports in her handbag on the back seat. Mrs Fielding is seen clinging on to the door, wrestling with him as she is half in and half out of the car. At one point, the brave woman loses her footing and is almost dragged under the wheels of the car as the man reverses . But she refuses to let go, clinging on right until the man has reversed into the nearby road . 'She refused to let go even though at one point she almost went under the car. 'This is not something she would normally, do, she is a little warrior, I'm so proud of her, though she was stupid to risk being hurt.' Miss Fielding, who arrived at work an hour later to find her mother being interviewed by police, said: 'I was so shocked when I came into work and heard what happened. 'My mum is bruised all over her body and in a lot of pain. She didn't want to go on holiday, and I think she will be in too much pain to enjoy it much.' She carries on as the man drives forwards again but - after a 30-second grapple - the carjacker eventually gives up and jumps out of the driver's seat . He then flees from the scene, leaving Mrs Fielding shocked and bruised - but with her car in tact . Miss Fielding said police were now trying to trace the thief. She begged anyone who might have seen anything to come forward. She said: 'There were lots of people waiting in their cars who saw the whole incident, although none of them bothered to get out of their cars to help or even called the police. If they had done, maybe he would have been caught in the act. 'My mother did not see his face, which he was trying to cover, and he didn't speak. He was wearing gloves so there's no fingerprints. But maybe someone recognises his clothes or the way he ran. 'He was an aggressive thief, he hurt her and I hope he's caught.'","Deborah Fielding, 52, exited her car so she could open barrier of workplace .

"Traffic jams are set to cost the average family more than £2,000 a year in lost time by 2030, a damning report reveals today. The cost will rise to more than £4,000 a year for families in London – the UK’s most congested city. Over the next 16 years congestion will wipe more than £300billion off the UK economy, the INRIX/CEBR report concludes. By 2030, the cost of sitting in traffic jams will be higher per person in the UK than in France, Germany or the US, the INRIX/CEBR report concludes . Traffic congestion: Population growth and a booming economy are the main factors driving the rise in traffic . Population growth – predicted to rise from 64million to 72million in 2030 and offset a fall in average car ownership levels - and a booming national economy are the main factors driving the rise in costly gridlock which will provide ‘a terrible shock’ for households. The annual cost of jams to the nation will soar by 63 per cent from £13billion last year to more than £21billion by 2030 – a figure that exceeds entire UK transport budget for 2014, it says. Over that same period, the predicted cost per household will increase by 44 percent – from £1,426 in 2013 to £2,057– or three times the average UK monthly rent in 2014, says the report. It will see the time spent by the average British motorist stuck each year in gridlock annually rise from 124 hours last year to 136 hours in 2030 - equivalent to 18 working days a year. In London, which suffers the worst congestion and delays, drivers spent more than 250 hours idling in traffic in 2013. This is double the UK average but is set to increase to 299 hours in 2030 - equivalent to 40 working days a year. The UK’s 63 per cent increase will be the highest among the main world economies studies and compares to a 50 per cent rise in the USA and 31 per cent in both Germany and France. More time is wasted in jams in London than any major city included in the report's findings . Growth in the number of miles travelled by car is forecast to be highest in the UK, and in London . London will be left in the Slow lane, with the sharpest fall in average speeds when in traffic congestion . 2013-2030 cumulative UK cost of congestion: £307billion (18 per cent of UK GDP in 2013) · £191billion – direct costs . · £115billion – indirect costs . 2013-2030 annual UK cost of congestion increase: 63 per cent . · £13.1billion in 2013 . · £21.4billion in 2030 (more than the entire UK transport budget in 2014) 2013-2030 per UK household cost of congestion increase: 44 per cent . · £1,426 in 2013 . · £2,057 in 2030 (three times the average UK monthly rent in 2014) Source: INRIX / Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) The study from traffic experts INRIX – who supply data used in car sat-nav systems - and the Centre for Economics and Business Research based its UK findings on the UK’s 18 largest urban areas. These include Belfast, Birmingham, Bradford-Leeds, Bristol, Cardiff, Coventry, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Kingston-upon-Hull, Leicester, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne, Nottingham, Portsmouth, Sheffield and Stoke-on-Trent. It says that although households will have fewer cars on average, population growth means there will be more cars on the road in absolute terms ‘as the UK economy continues to strengthen.’ The INRIX report concludes: ‘Between 2013 and 2030, the total cumulative cost of congestion to the UK economy is estimated to be a staggering £307billion.’ Of that £307billion - equivalent to nearly a fifth (18 per cent) of the nation’s productive wealth  last year - some £191billion is in the form of ‘direct costs ‘ such as the value of fuel and the time wasted by not being productive at work. A further £115billion is in the form of ‘indirect costs’ which relate to higher transport and freight costs and business fees from company vehicles idling in traffic, which are passed on to consumers as additional costs to household bills. The report notes that in the UK last year, almost 70 per cent of the workforce commuted to work by car during peak times, with the average British driver spending 124 hours stuck in gridlock annually. ‘This is set to rise to 136 hours in 2030, equivalent to 18 working days a year. This has both a direct and indirect economic impact on car commuting households,' the report says. And adds: ‘In London, the UK’s most congested city, drivers spent more than 250 hours idling in traffic in 2013, which is double the UK average. This is set to increase to 299 hours in 2030, equivalent to 40 working days a year.'

Source: INRIX / Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) It says that although fewer than a third of Londoners commute to work by car, the cost of living and the value of time for the capital’s 1.4million car commuters is at such a premium that it will cost ‘each car commuting household more than £4,000 a year by 2030.’ The cost of congestion to the capital’s economy will rise by 71 per cent – from £5.4billion in 2013 to £9.3billion in 2030. The cost per London household will rise over the same period by 44 per cent – from £2,765 in 2013 to £4,002 in 2030. As a result, the cumulative cost of congestion in London over the next 16 years will top £130billion, of which £68billion will be direct costs and £62billion indirect costs. The INRIX/CEBR report concludes that population growth and the ‘expected strengthening of the British economy’ will lead to ‘a significant increase in the demand for road travel across the country over the next 16 years.’ It notes: ‘Population growth is the largest driver of road travel demand in the UK. UK population is predicted to grow by 12 per cent, from 64million in 2013 to 72million in 2030.' London alone will experience a 20 per cent population increase from 8.4million to 10.1million over the period. This will place a significant strain on the capital’s road network’. GDP is predicted to rise by a quarter (24 per cent) by 2030: ‘As incomes increase, households are expected to choose car travel over other forms of transport, driving up congestion levels as a result.' Car ownership levels, which last year stood at stood at 448 vehicles per 1,000 people are ‘expected to decrease slightly’ because of shifting attitudes and investment in rail. But the report stresses: ‘The absolute number of vehicles on the UK’s roads is still expected to be higher by 2030 as a result of continued population growth’. The World Bank’s prediction of stable fuel prices suggests UK fuel prices will increase by only 2 per cent in real terms, from £1.34 per litre in 2013 to £1.36 in 2030, it says . Added to improvements in fuel economy, this will ‘reduce the effective cost of motoring’ and persuade more people to drive, it says. Matt Simmons, European director of INRIX said: ‘This study is a warning of the worsening impact of gridlock on the British economy and on household budgets. ‘We now know that congestion will continue to have serious consequences for national and city economies, businesses and citizens in the years to come. If we think this problem is bad now, we are in for a terrible shock come 2030.’","Annual cost of jams in the UK will soar by 63 per cent to £21billion by 2030 .

"A cross-bow wielding, 7-year-old Michigan girl has accomplished her mission to replace the prized 8-point buck trophy that hung on her bedroom wall before it was destroyed in a devastating fire. Riley Skirkin was just 5 years old when she bagged the deer on her first time out with her father, who owns a store for hunters in St. Louis, Michigan. Now, the tenacious little huntress has a new trophy buck to hang on her wall and this one's an impressive 8-points, too. Sharp shooter: Riley Skirvin, 7, recently  killed this 8-point buck . Keeping watch: Riley peers through binoculars. She was able to kill the buck this year, after the head of a mounted buck she shot two years ago burned in a fire . 'If there was one item I could have saved in that house it would have been that buck,' Riley's dad Ben Skirvin told MLive.com. Before the loss, Riley wanted to get a doe this season. But according to her dad, the little girl said she wanted another 8-point to replace the one that burned up along with many of the family's other belongings May 21. What's so shocking, is that she did just that, and with ease. 'It sounds funny but it seems like every time she goes out there's bucks are coming in to her,' Mr. Skirvin said. Riley herself described to MLive just how it happened. Huntress: The first buck Riley shot, at just 5 years old, was successfully killed with a crossbow . Lost but remembered: This prized 8-point buck trophy hung on Riley Skirvin's bedroom wall before it was destroyed in a devastating fire. Riley and her father Ben Skirvin pose with the animal . 'My dad was looking around and then he saw a deer and it came up to the bait pile,' Riley said. 'I asked him what line to use (inside the scope on her crossbow) and he told me it was the top line.' She pulled the trigger and put a bolt through both the animal's lungs. 'I was crying because I was so happy,” she said. “Very, very, really happy,' Riley told MLive. Next year, Riley said she'll pursue her goal of bagging a doe, but laments: 'Bucks love me.' Target practice: Riley Skirvin is seen crouched with a crossbow .

"George Zimmerman will not face federal civil rights charges over the 2012 shooting of black teenager Trayvon Martin, it has been claimed. Three law enforcement officials have reportedly said there is insufficient evidence to prove the killing was racially motivated and that the case will now have to be dropped. Zimmerman was last year acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the shooting death of 17 year old Martin, following a high-profile trial in Sanford, Florida. Scroll down for video . In the clear? George Zimmerman, left, will not federal charges over the 2012 shooting of teenager Trayvon Martin, right, it has been claimed . The verdict, which followed months of heightened racial tension over the killing, sparked a series of nationwide demonstrations. Over 600,000 people signed an online petition urging the Department of Justice to press civil rights charges against Zimmerman. But yesterday, the three officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to the Washington Post, said it was almost certain that the department would close the investigation. One of the officials, who was not authorized to discuss the case, told the Post that investigators now only wanted to 'dot their i’s and cross their t’s'. While it is understood the team still want to look at a computer belonging to Zimmerman which had no not been examined for the state trial, it is highly unlikely that it would contain any useable evidence. The Justice Department insist the investigation remains open, with a source telling Fox News: 'The investigation into the shooting is active and ongoing'. Protests: Thousands took to the streets across America after Zimmerman was  acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the shooting death of 17-year-old Martin . Anger: Demonstrators gather in New York's Time Square to demanded justice a day after Zimmerman was found not guilty . For Zimmerman to be found guilty of a . hate crime prosecutors would have to prove he both followed and shot . Martin purely because he was an African American. Benjamin Crump, an attorney representing . Martin’s family, said they were not prepared to comment until an . official announcement by the justice department. Zimmerman, a former neighbourhood watch volunteer, was accused of murdering the unarmed Martin in a racially motivated attack. The Martin case draws many similarities with that of Michael Brown whose killing by a white police officer has prompted two civil rights investigations . Prosecutors . claimed the Zimmerman had automatically assumed Martin, who was walking . to his father's apartment to watch a basketball game on television, was . a criminal because he was black and wearing a hooded top. Zimmerman confronted Martin on the street and following a struggle pulled a pistiol from his waitsband and shot the teenager through the cheek at point blank range. But Zimmerman's defence team argued there was no evidence to prove their client, who describes himself as Hispanic, was racist. They pointed to statements saying that Zoimmerman had taken a black girl to his school prom, that his best friend was black and that he had mentored two black youths. Following the trial Zimmerman reportedly went into hiding fearing he would be targeted. Such was the reaction to the not guilty verdict that President Barack Obama was forced to make a personal appeal for calm. He said at the time: 'We are a nation of laws and a jury has spoken. 'I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.' The case draws many similarities to that 18-year-old Michael Brown, a black teenager who died after being shot at least six times by a white police officer in Ferguson.

March 13th, 2012 - Sanford Police Department's homicide detective Christopher Serino says that he recommends that Zimmerman be charged with manslaughter. He says that Zimmerman 'failed to identify himself' as a neighborhood watch member on two occasions that night. He says he believed Zimmerman's injuries to be 'marginally consistent with a life-threatening episode, as described by him, during which neither a deadly weapon nor deadly force were deployed by Trayvon Martin.' March 14th, 2012 - The case is turned over to Florida State Attorney Norm Wilfinger . March 15th, 2012 - George Zimmerman's fahter, Robert Zimmerman, writes a letter to the Orlando Sentinel in which he explains that his son is Hispanic and is being erroneously portrayed as a racist.

"Seven of 15 men detained during Sydney's terror raids were members of a Muslim street preaching group,  led by wanted terrorist Mohammad Al Baryalei, it has been claimed. The men were volunteers for the Parramatta Street Dawah group, which 'reverts' random members of the public to Islam in spontaneous ceremonies on the street, according to Fairfax reports. The local council, assisted by police, had recently banned the group from operating on the streets of Parramatta in Sydney's west, after the council received complaints that the group was preaching and handing out pamphlets. The manager of Parramatta Mosque, Neil El-Kadomi confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that the seven young men who were detained prayed at Parramatta mosque, and were often seen professing their faith on the streets. Mr El-Kadomi is shocked at their arrest, telling Daily Mail that the young men were 'very nice men, just normal kids.' 'You saw them in the street and in the mosque and they were very nice young men,' said Mr El-Kadomi. It is alleged that five members from the western-Sydney based movement have been killed whilst fighting in Syria and Iraq, with 'many more' still overseas as soldiers for the Islamic State. Scroll down for video . Police allege Baryalei was the catalyst behind last Thursday's counter-terrorism raids that saw more than 800 police raid multiple homes in Sydney and Brisbane . A friend of the detained men claim they were only targeted by police because of their association with the Dawah group. 'They're all good friends and a close-knit group,' a friend of the group told Sun Herald. 'But none of the guys are extreme or violent. They were raided because of their association with Baryalei and the Dawah group.' It's claimed that one of the group's former leaders is wanted terrorist Mohammad Ali Baryalei. Baryalei was allegedly the ringleader behind a plot to execute a random Australian, which sparked counter-terrorism raids last Thursday. The raids were insitgated when police allegedly intercepted a phone call from Baryalei to Sydney 22-year-old Omarjan Azari, which detailed the plot to execute a random Australian on camera. Omarjan's brothers Samim and Waris were also detained during the raids but released without charge. Baryalei is captured in YouTube videos, undertaking his responsibilities with Parramatta Street Dawah group. There are reports almost half of the men detained during Sydney's terror raids were members of a Muslim street preaching group, led by wanted terrorist Mohammad Al Baryalei (pictured) He left Australia in April last year to the Turkey-Syria border, where he has been responsible for recruiting and moving around half of the 60 Australians fighting with terrorists groups in Syria and Iraq. Three other Parramatta Street Dawah preachers are amongst those who have died in the past two years in Syria in the war zone, as part of the fanatical ISIL militant movement. The deceased Australians include Ahmad Moussalli, Sheik Mustapha al Majzoub, Yusuf Ali and Ali's wife Amira Karroum, . When Sheik Mustapha al Majzoub died in Syria in August of 2012, the Street Dawah Australia Facebook page posted a tribute to the man they called 'Our Beloved Brother/Teacher.' Mohammad Ali Baryalei, who is now Australia's most senior Islamic State leader, worked as a spruiker outside a Kings Cross strip club before he turned to radical Islam . The Street Dawah movement has been coined 'a key breeding ground for radical young Sydneysiders'. Since June 2012, the group has operated out of Parramatta as part of the international Street Dawah movement, 'spreading the blessing of Allah.' Police claim Baryalei is still a major influence on the Dawah members in Sydney. They are believed to have around 12 thousand supporters. Mr El-Kadomi says the adherents at Parramatta Mosque respect what the police are doing, and will be happy to cooperate with authorities if they communicate more efficiently. 'The government and the police is not doing enough to come and talk to the community and explain what's going on,' said Mr El-Kadomi. 'We love to help the government.' Mr El-Kadomi of the Parramatta Mosque insists adherents at the Mosque are proud Australians, helping to build the country and respectful of the police operation. 'Here, we are Muslim Australians. We are Australians as much as any other Australian,' said Mr El-Kadomi . 'We love our country. We help in building Australia. 'We are a normal good citizen in Australia so we need everybody to respect us as much as we respect others.' Neighbours of Baryalei's mum told The Australian she had no idea her son was involved with militant groups until police raided their family home at Quakers Hill last December. 'She thought her son was over there studying,' the neighbour said. 'After her house was raided, she said they must be mistaken, her son would never do anything wrong.' Baryalei is believed to be currently in the Syrian city of Raqqa in a protected location, according to the newspaper. The Australian Federal Police have an arrest warrant out for Baryalei. Baryalei, pictured with US-Australian citizen Tyler Casey (back) who was killed in Syria in January, is alleged to have recruited half of the 60 Australians believed to be fighting for the Islamic State in the Middle East . Mohammad Ali Baryalei was featured in a number of YouTube videos attempting to convert random Australians to Islam.

"A  woman accused of murdering her newborn son waited 17 hours after the baby died before calling an ambulance and reporting her child stillborn, a court has heard. Paramedics arrived to find the dead infant wrapped in a towel and lying on a washing machine at the Gold Coast home on June 8, the woman's bail hearing was told. Jodie Tarnawskyj, 35, was denied bail in the Brisbane Supreme Court on Thursday because she was deemed a flight risk. Scroll down for video . Jodie Tarnawskyj, 35, was denied bail in Brisbane Supreme Court on Thursday accused of murdering her newborn son on Juna 8 . The mother of two was arrested last week and charged with murdering her son on June 8. The court was told Tarnawskyj had concealed her pregnancy from her partner and friends and tried to terminate the pregnancy twice. Crown prosecutor Sandra Cupina said while pregnant the unemployed Tarnawskyj researched how to end a pregnancy and took drugs she knew were dangerous to the fetus. On the evening of June 8, Tarnawskyj called the ambulance service on a non-emergency line and said her 30-week-old baby had been stillborn 17 hours earlier. However, medical evidence indicated the baby was 40 weeks old - full term - and breathing when born, Ms Cupina said. The pathologist's report hasn't been finalised but suggests the infant died shortly after birth. No cause of death has been found, though the infant had bruising on his lips, internal neck bruising and indications of bleeding in the brain and swelling in the brain tissue, which could be a sign of oxygen deprivation, the court heard. Ms Cupina said the injuries did not conclusively show the baby was intentionally harmed. The Paradise Point woman waited 17 hours after the baby died before calling an ambulance and reporting her child stillborn, a court has heard . When Tarnawskyj rang the ambulance she said she hadn't known she was pregnant when she 'felt the urge to push' and delivered the baby - blue and not breathing - in the toilet, according to prosecution evidence read out in court by Justice Peter Applegarth. However, Ms Cupina said the former dietician had conducted internet searches about pregnancy and stillbirth and how someone could end a pregnancy. Between her child's death and calling the ambulance Tarnawskyj picked up a cat from a friend and brought it back to her home at Paradise Point. In April, Tarnawskyj told a doctor she had miscarried and the pregnancy hadn't been far along. She also told a friend and her de facto she wasn't pregnant and had a blood clot. 'This conduct all points to one conclusion, which is that the applicant was going to be sure this baby was to die and she intended this baby to die,' Ms Cupina said. Defence lawyer Angelo Vasta said there was no evidence Tarnawskyj killed or intended to kill her child and her 'bizarre' behaviour after its death could be put down to depression. 'This is no case of murder. At best it could be a case of manslaughter,' he told the court. However, Justice Applegarth said there was a prospect Tarnawskyj could be convicted of either murder or manslaughter and she had a 'powerful incentive' not to appear at trial. Tarnawskyj was not in court for the decision and remains behind bars. Her case is due to be mentioned in the Southport Magistrates Court on February 2.

"A self-proclaimed spiritual healer, who was charged with sexual and indecent assault offences earlier this year, has had another 40 offences added to his name. Mohammad Hassan Manteghi, 49, also known as Man Monis, appeared in court in April on one count of sexual intercourse without consent and two counts of indecent assault, where he was refused bail. It's alleged Mr Manteghi, who claims to be a spiritual healer, advised a 27-year-old woman in 2002 to visit him at his business in Wentworthville in Sydney's west after she contacted him through a 'Spiritual Consultation' ad in a community newspaper. A self-proclaimed 'spiritual healer' is facing another 40 sex crime charges . The woman was indecently assaulted during her first consultation with Manteghi in August 2002. A week later at their next meeting, the woman was allegedly sexually assaulted. The state's sex crime squad has been investigating and officers charged Manteghi at his appearance at Penrith Local Court on Friday with fresh offences. They include 22 counts of aggravated sexual assault and 14 counts of aggravated indecent assault. The new offences were allegedly committed against six additional women, all of whom visited the man when he was offering services as a 'spiritual healer'. He has been granted bail and is next due to appear in court in February.","A self-proclaimed 'spiritual healer' is facing another 40 sex crime charges .

Tammy performed in front of examiners at London College of Music at the University of West London and was awarded a 76 per cent pass mark. Ms Chambers said: ‘I'm a musician so I think that's why Tammy has become so good so quickly. She lives with music every day. ‘You don't realise how much children absorb - yes she's had an advantage because of my background, but still, for a four-year-old, it's incredible. She's been singing her head off from the age of two. ‘Her repertoire is just staggering - she knows everything. Her musical memory is incredible. From Elvis to classical music, she knows it all.’ Singing success: Tammy, pictured with her mother at the piano in their Stockport home, sang a song from Disney film Aladdin and was awarded a merit in her exam .

"Former lorry driver Tom Naylor, 58, is taking his neighbour to court in a bid to settle a bitter boundary dispute over a 3ft strip of land . A £15.5 million lottery jackpot winner is taking his neighbour to court in a bid to settle a bitter boundary dispute over a 3ft strip of land - for just a few thousand pounds. Former lorry driver Tom Naylor, 58, and his wife Rita, 56, won the multi-million pound windfall in 2001. They moved into a luxury £480,000 luxury barn conversion with two acres of land in the picturesque village of Wheaton Aston, Staffordshire . But after retreating to the countryside, Mr Naylor became embroiled in a bitter turf war over a tiny plot of grass which skirts around the southern edge of his property. Sections of the disputed area are owned by three neighbouring businesses but nobody can agree who owns the 3ft (0.9m) wide strip of land that runs for just 150 metres along the boundary. Incredibly, Mr Naylor is now taking restaurant owner Zillar Rahman to court over the 'petty' dispute which is expected to cost him thousands of pounds in legal bills. His demands, which are detailed in a county court claim form, include £900 for putting up a new fence. The lottery winner also wants additional costs for repairing the sewer system, damages for alleged trespass and all legal costs and fees. Scroll down for video . In his claim, multi-millionaire Mr Nayor says he is expecting to recover 'more than £5,000 but not more than £15,000'. The former HGV driver says Mr Rahman, who owns the Cafe India restaurant to the south of his property, demolished his boundary fence in April 2012. He also alleges the neighbour tampered with a manhole cover that sealed a foul drainage system - causing raw sewage to flood his paddock and driveway. No man's land? Restaurateur Zillar Rahman (left), pictured with resident Chris Rawlings, is in a dispute over the strip of land with the lottery winner . A Google earth image shows the strip of land behind the three businesses that is at the centre of the dispute . But Mr Rahman disputes the claims and says the millionaire illegally put up the boundary fence in 2012 in a bid to claim land that didn't belong to him. He also says it was Mr Naylor driving wooden fence posts into the ground that caused the dirty contents of the burst sewage pipe to flood back onto his own land. Vowing to fight for the small plot of grass today, Mr Rahman, 39, said: 'As far as I am concerned the land belongs to me. 'When he put up the fence he moved the posts a few yards onto my land and it caused all the damage to the sewers. 'I had to take it down to get the manhole cover repaired. The job cost me thousands of pounds to fix a problem he caused.' Neighbour Chris Rawlins, 61, whose home is sandwiched between Mr Naylor's luxury barn conversion and Cafe India, added: 'I have seen the plans and in my opinion the land does not belong to Mr Naylor. 'The boundary is a straight line running the length of his property up to Staffordshire Motor Homes. 'He is trying to say there is a dog leg but the plans don't show that at all.' Plush: Lottery winner Tom Naylor's £480,000 property near Wheaton Aston,Staffordshire . Mr Rahman, owner of Cafe India, disputes the claims and says the millionaire illegally put up the boundary fence in 2012 in a bid to claim land that didn't belong to him . The two parties tried to sort out their differences through mediation in May this year but talks broke down. And now, Mark English, who is from Shakespeare Solicitors representing Mr Naylor, confirmed the claim was going through the court process. He declined to comment on the details but speaking in February this year Mr Naylor, who says he still plays the lottery every week, claimed the land belonged to his property. The millionaire, who spent £375,000 on the barn in April 2002, said: 'It may look like a straight line on the map but that's because the drawings are so small. 'I have photographs showing where the original boundary was and the original owner of the land has backed me up. 'The restaurant owner flattened my fence and left my land in a terrible state when he employed workmen to raise a manhole cover two years ago. 'It's quite simple really. I want my land back and my fence put back up.' Earlier this year, residents accused Mr Naylor of having 'nothing better to do' since retiring from his job as a HGV driver following the huge jackpot win. Andy Smith, who runs Weston Motor Company, added: 'These disputes haven't really affected us so far but he's not short of land that's for sure. 'I suspect he's just doing it because he has nothing better to be doing these days.' The case is now due to be heard at Stafford County Court early next year.","Millionaire Tom Naylor is embroiled in a row over a thin stretch of grass .

"Nasa’s first spacewalk since April is currently underway, and can be watched live online. American astronaut Reid Wiseman and German Alexander Gerst are working together to move a broken pump, that has been been outside the station since December, into its proper storage location. The spacewalk is scheduled to last until about 7.40pm BST (2.40pm EST) today. Watch a live stream of the spacewalk below. If the stream isn't being displayed correctly you can watch it live at Nasa's website . US-based spacewalks were curtailed in July 2013 after Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano nearly drowned because of a flooded helmet. Nasa solved the problem with the suit's water-cooling system, but then concern arose over the spacesuit batteries. New batteries arrived late last month, clearing the way for today's spacewalk, and another one scheduled for next week. The 780lb (350kg) pump on the move is about the size of a double-door refrigerator. Construction of the ISS began on 20 November 1998. It supports a crew of up to six, with crews split into groups of three. The station orbits at a height of about 264 miles (425 kilometres). It has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds (450,000 kilograms) and has liveable space roughly equivalent to a five-bedroom house. It completes an orbit of Earth every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles (27,600 kilometres) per hour. It has now been in space for more than 5,800 days, during which time it has completed more than 88,000 orbits of Earth, and has been continuously occupied for over 13 years. It ended up in temporary storage during urgent spacewalking repairs to the station's ammonia-cooling system last December. Nasa did not want to waste time back then putting the pump in the correct long-term location, given all the spacesuit worries. This was the first spacewalk ever for Mr Wiseman and Mr Gerst, and the former’s exuberance was evident as he emerged from the hatch into the vast darkness over the Pacific. ‘Wow, looks like we've almost got a full moon out here. It's beautiful,’ he said. When the glow of sunrise started to appear several minutes later, he shared his excitement again with Mission Control. A follow-up spacewalk is scheduled for 15 October to further whittle down Nasa’s lengthy to-do list, on hold since the 2013 incident. That spacewalk will be conducted by Mr Wiseman and fellow American Butch Wilmore, a newcomer. A week after that, two of the three Russians on board will perform a spacewalk on their country's side of the orbiting outpost. The Moscow-led spacewalks were unaffected by Nasa's spacesuit troubles. Engineers at Nasa's mission control centre in Houston are talking two astronauts through a long overdue spacewalk on the ISS. American Reid Wiseman and German Alexander Gerst are moving a refrigerator-sized pump (pictured) left outside the station in December . The pump could not be moved until now owing to spacesuit troubles. In July last year, Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano almost drowned when his helmet filled with water following a coolant fault. And later a battery malfunction left astronauts unable to go out the station. Pictured is a still image from the current spacewalk . In July 2013, Nasa was forced to dramatically abandon a spacewalk on the ISS after a dangerous water leak in an astronaut's helmet drenched his eyes, nose and mouth. Italy's first spacewalker, Luca Parmitano, endured the terrifying experience when his drink bag tipped half a liter of floating liquid around his face. Parmitano could not speak or hear his radio due to the water, and he got wedged outside the craft before being helped in by fellow astronauts. The leak was so bad that Parmitano asked his spacewalking partner, American Christopher Cassidy, to help him back in. 'It's a lot of water,' the Italian said once he was back in the air lock of the station. He later recalled that he thought he was going to drown during the ordeal. The helmets used by Mr Wiseman and Mr Gerst for today's spacewalk contained absorbent pads and makeshift snorkels in case of water leakage. As for the spacesuit batteries, Nasa sent up replacements on the latest SpaceX cargo ship and Russian Soyuz capsule. Ground testing uncovered a potential fuse problem earlier this year, and Nasa opted to switch out the batteries on board. In the movie Gravity, which stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, the astronauts fight for survival after a cloud of debris wrecks their Space Shuttle and subsequently destroys the ISS (shown). The latest spacewalk might not be this dramatic but the feat of engineering involved is impressive nonetheless .
