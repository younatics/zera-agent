"By . Dan Bloom for MailOnline . It sounds like a textbook millionaire's bolthole - four bedrooms, two bathrooms and a mooring on the River Thames. But this £1.8million manor comes with something even the most imaginative buyer could only dream of - a prison made of stones from London Bridge. Former BBC journalist Lynn Lewis bought the long-forgotten fragment when he and his wife Valerie built their mock-Georgian Tower House in Shepperton, Surrey, from scratch in 2002. Millionaire's bolthole: The mock Georgian Tower House in Shepperton, Surrey, was built from scratch in 2002 by former BBC journalist Lynn Lewis and his wife Valerie. It has a garden feature for the man who has everything - an imitation prison made from the original stones which were used to build the 19th Century London Bridge . Another brick in the wall: The stones at the bottom of the garden look innocuous - but they are from the 19th Century London Bridge and comprise a mock prison . No bridge needed: If the owner can make it beyond the bridge-jail, lying in wait is a private mooring on the River Thames with enough room for two boats . Mr Lewis was fascinated by the history of the site, which had formerly housed a sprawling manor which came with its own title. The Lord of the Manor had to provide a jail so Mr Lewis did just that, building it out of the stone fragments which had been removed from the Victorian bridge when it was widened more than 100 years ago. The 19th Century London Bridge was designed by John Rennie and opened in 1831, replacing its 600-year-old Medieval predecessor which had become crammed with traffic. It was the latest in a long history of Thames crossings dating back to Roman times but had to be expanded in 1896, to accommodate the heaving crowds for the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria the next year. It is then that it is thought the stone fragment was removed and taken to a field near what is now Heathrow Airport, where it lay forgotten for several decades until it was reportedly rediscovered by the engineer and inventor Sir Barnes Wallis. Heaving: A view of the 19th Century London Bridge before it was dismantled and reassembled piece-by-piece in the Arizona desert - with the Surrey chunk missing . Sprawling: The luxurious house was custom-built just over a decade ago by its most recent owners, former BBC journalist Lynn Lewis and his wife Valerie . Throne: Sitting on the site of a former estate, the mock Georgian home brings with it the rather grandiose title of Lord of the Manor and the need to have a private jail . The Victorian London Bridge was eventually dismantled in 1967 and reassembled stone-by-stone in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, after the oil tycoon Robert P McCulloch bought the remains for $2.46million. But the millionaire had little idea that a piece of his bridge, which still stands today, had been left behind. Now 77, Mr Lewis and his wife spent many years running a floating antiques shop on their barge on the River Thames before finally deciding to sell Tower House this year. The mock Georgian property is on the market for £1.8million and is set in around three acres with its own 130ft-long private mooring on the Thames with room for two boats. Tim Firth, sales director at Jackson-Stops & Staff, said: 'It is not a large house, but it is lovely property. It would suit a couple and there is a mooring' Old and new: Although the house features the remains of London Bridge, most of it is considerably more modern with a number of outbuildings . Large: It also has two reception rooms, one of which has a bay window and double doors looking out on the Thames, along with a conservatory and several outbuildings . It also has two reception rooms, one of which has a bay window and double doors looking out on the Thames, along with a conservatory and several outbuildings, including a stable. Tim Firth, sales director at the Shepperton office of Jackson-Stops & Staff, said: 'The home was on the land of a large manor home which was split up. Whoever buys it gets the title of Lord of the Manor. 'One of the historic jobs for the Lord of the Manor was to provide a jail. So the developer built a mock jail in the garden using parts of the old London bridge. 'It is not a large house, but it is lovely property. It would suit a couple and there is a mooring so it is ideal for a boat person.' Unlikely attraction: The bridge took three years to ship to the U.S. and reassemble along with a traditional 'English' village, with open-air shops and a hedge maze . It was an unlikely fate for a piece of British engineering - dismantled stone by 19th Century stone and painstakingly reassembled across a lake in the middle of the Arizona desert. But that is exactly what the tycoon Robert P McCulloch did in 1968 when he bought the bridge for $2.46million, around £10.2million in today's money, in an enthusiastic bid to turn the barren Lake Havasu into a tourist attraction. Popular legend tells that McCulloch thought he was buying the far more famous Tower Bridge, but the rumour was always furiously denied. Argument aside, his wacky idea was generally seen as a success. The bridge took three years to ship to the U.S. and reassemble, and with it he built a traditional 'English' village which featured open-air shops and a hedge maze. The bridge still stands today, and the area around it has seen hefty modern redevelopment. Tourist strip: A more recent view of the bridge, which still stands today.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The historic draft of Michael Sam by the NFL’s St Louis Rams also introduced the world to his boyfriend Vito Cammisano. The two men embraced in tears of joy before repeatedly kissing after Sam smashed cake into Cammisano’s face on national television – and answered rampant speculation over whether the defensive lineman has a boyfriend. The 2013 University of Missouri graduate has been publicly out since 2011 and competed on the school’s swim team as its first gay athlete, according to OutSports. Celebration: Michael Sam and Vito Cammisano celebrate his being picked in the draft with a kis . He attended Rockhurst High School, on Kansas City, Missouri, prior to attending Mizzou as a communications major, according to his Facebook profile. Sam’s 23-year-old boyfriend was previously unknown to all but their closest friends prior to Saturday night’s big moment - except to anyone who may have stumbled across his social media accounts. The Cumulus Broadcasting intern’s Instagram feed is filled with pictures of him and Sam on trips, having drinks together and even just relaxing at home. Sam publicly acknowledged Cammisano via social media for the first time by tagging him in a tweet with a picture of the two kissing while covered in cake. On vacation: The two men pictured on the beach recently in Santa Barbara . Brunch!: The two men sip mimosas only a few days ago . Happy together: Cammisano and Sam are all smiles in this pic . Happy couple: Sam and Cammisano are pictured several times together on the Mizzou swimmer's Facebook and Instagram accounts . His Facebook page lists only one athlete he likes – Michael Sam. Cammisano has two sisters and also worked in Missou’s Office of Disability Services while attending school. He graduated last year from the same campus attended by his star football player boyfriend. Earlier reports from multiple media outlets pegged a Sean Smith from Urbana, Illinois as Sam’s boyfriend. There is some evidence to suggest a Sean Smith may have dated Sam in the past, but he clearly is not with him now. Both Sam and Cammisano embraced in a historic moment inside Sam’s agent’s house in San Diego, California after he received the call he had been waiting for most of his life. He was a St Louis Ram, he was in the NFL. And Vito was there to celebrate with him.","Michael Sam is dating former Mizzou swimmer Vito Cammisano .

"Kei Nishikori produced a remarkable physical feat to defeat Stan Wawrinka in five sets and become the first Japanese man in the Open era to reach a grand slam semi-final. Tenth seed Nishikori had beaten Milos Raonic in the fourth round in five sets in a match that finished at 2.26am - the joint latest finish in US Open history. He was back on Arthur Ashe Stadium barely 36 hours later and battled for another four hours and 15 minutes to put out the Australian Open champion 3-6 7-5 7-6 (9/7) 6-7 (5/7) 6-4. The last Japanese man to make the last four at a grand slam was Jiro Satoh at Wimbledon in 1933. Down and out: Stanislas Wawrinka was beaten by Kei Nishikori 3-6, 5-7, 7-6, 7-6, 6-4 . Eastern promise: Nishikori becomes the first Japanese player to reach a grand slam semi since 1918 . Nishikori said: 'I started a little bit tight but my body was okay, I was feeling more and more confident, especially getting the third set. I don't know how I finished the match but I'm very happy. 'I feel amazing. This is my favourite grand slam. I have good memories here and I'm very happy to be first time in the semis. I hope I can recover again and play 100 per cent tennis next round.' Given Nishikori's exertions, it was no real surprise when Wawrinka raced into a 3-0 lead, and that was enough for the Swiss to take the opening set. But Wawrinka, who put on a masterclass against Andy Murray at the same stage last year to reach his first slam semi-final, has not been on top form this tournament and it was the same again. The 29-year-old was making bad mistakes at bad times, none more so than the double fault that handed Nishikori the second set. Wasted: Wawrinkaraced to an early lead before being hauled by by the energetic Nishikori . Marathon man: Nishikori played in second five set match in succession after defeating Milos Raonic in last 16 . Far from tiring, the Japanese player seemed to be improving as the match went on, his forehand in particular keeping Wawrinka on the run. Nishikori made his move in the sixth game of the third set with a break of the Wawrinka serve and had a set point at 5-2 but could not take it. And that looked a huge moment in the following game when Nishikori made a complete mess of serving for the set and lost his advantage. Below par: Wawrinka has struggled to find his top form during this tournament . The 24-year-old collected himself to force a tie-break and had another set point on his own serve only for Wawrinka to thread a brilliant backhand pass down the line. A vicious forehand gave the Swiss a chance to clinch it but Nishikori responded in kind with a stunning backhand winner of his own. These were huge moments in the match, and it was Nishikori who came out on top, Wawrinka going long with his 55th unforced error. The toll on Nishikori showed after three games of the fourth set when he took a medical time-out to have his blisters treated but he continued to play high-level tennis to keep pace comfortably with Wawrinka. Mentor: Nishikora is coached by former grand slam winner Michael Chang . Nishikori fought back from 4-0 down in the tie-break to level at 4-4 but missed two forehands wide and Wawrinka landed a huge second serve on the back of the line to level proceedings. With the match well into its fourth hour, they headed into a decider, and it was Wawrinka who finally cracked, serving a double fault to give up two match points at 4-5. He saved the first but netted a forehand on the second to send Nishikori, who is coached by former French Open champion Michael Chang, into the last four.","Kei Nishikori defeated Stanislas Wawrinka 3-6 7-5 7-6 (9/7) 6-7 (5/7) 6-4 .

"Iran claims to have shot down an Israeli drone near a nuclear site. The Revolutionary Guards said its forces shot down the stealth drone as it approached the Natanz nuclear enrichment site, 50 miles south of the capital, Tehran. A statement released by the . Guards said its forces fired . a missile at the drone, but did not say when it shot down the drone or how they knew it was Israeli. Scroll down for video . Iranian President Hassan Rowhani (centre) passes by Iranian missiles as visits Iran's defence capabilities  exhibition in Tehran. Iran claims to have shot down an Israeli spy drone that crossed into its airspace near the nuclear facility in Natanz . Video courtesy of Press TV . The incident comes as Iran negotiates with world powers over its nuclear programme and hard-liners press moderate President Hassan Rouhani to demand more concessions before limiting its atomic capabilities. Israel has not ruled out taking military action against Iran's nuclear facilities if its capability to build an atomic weapon progresses. Guards spokesman Gen. Ramazan Sharif later told Iranian state television that officials believed it to be a 'new generation' drone used by Israel. 'Major parts of the devices of the drone are intact and have been received by our friends that can be used for further information,' Sharif said. Sharif did not say when the aircraft was shot down, but said it was 'identified upon arrival in Iranian airspace."" He said authorities allowed it to fly for a short time to determine its destination. The Revolutionary Guards said the unmanned aerial vehicle was intercepted by a surface-to-air missile before it could approach the facility in central Iran. The incident comes as Iran negotiates with world powers over its nuclear programme and hard-liners press the moderate president to demand more concessions before limiting its atomic capabilities . Lawmaker Alaeddin Boroujerdi, the head of an influential parliamentary committee on national security and foreign policy, also told a news website associated with Iran's armed forces that the 'point of departure' for the drone should be determined, suggesting it likely flew in from one of Iran's neighbors. Iran's nuclear program has been the target of espionage and sabotage efforts in the past. In 2010, the so-called Stuxnet virus temporarily disrupted operation of thousands of centrifuges, key components in nuclear fuel production, at Iran's Natanz uranium enrichment facility. Iran says it and other computer virus attacks are part of a concerted effort by Israel, the U.S. and their allies to undermine its nuclear program through covert operations. Israel has never commented on the allegations but is widely believed to have been involved in the Stuxnet attack. The Revolutionary Guards said its forces shot down the stealth drone as it approached the Natanz nuclear enrichment site, 50 miles south of the capital, Tehran . Since then, Iran has also said that it discovered tiny timed explosives planted on centrifuges but disabled them before they could go off. Authorities now claim the Islamic Republic is immune to cyberattacks. Meanwhile, world powers and Iran continue to negotiate on a final deal regarding Iran's nuclear program. A deal struck last November saw some sanctions eased in exchange for Iran limiting its uranium enrichment. The West fears Iran may be able to develop a nuclear weapon. Iran denies the charges, saying its nuclear program is peaceful and aimed at generating electricity and medical research. Iran has said it captured several American drones that violated the country's airspace in the past. In 2011, Iran said it captured an advanced CIA spy RQ-170 Sentinel drone and later reverse-engineered it.","The stealth drone was shot down as it approached Natanz nuclear site .

"By . Larry Fine, Reuters . Russian left-hander Ekaterina Makarova made her best mark in grand slam singles by outslugging Victoria Azarenka, the US Open runner-up the last two years, 6-4 6-2 on Wednesday to reach the semi-finals of the US Open. The 17th-seeded Russian was steadier and more explosive with her big groundstrokes in dismissing the 16th seed from Belarus and advancing to the last four of a major for the first time after four losses in the quarter-finals stage. Boldly going for winners at every opportunity against the former world number one, Makarova pressured Azarenka to a dozen break points and cashed in twice in each set for her victory. Proud: Russian tennis ace Ekaterina Makarova is delighted to have made the US Open semi-finals . Round of applause: Makarova waves to the crowd after defeating Victoria Azarenka of Belarus . 'I'm feeling amazing. Finally I'm in a semi-finals, finally I'm here,' the 26-year-old Makarova, who is better known for her doubles exploits, told the Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd. 'It's a great feeling.' Makarova has hoisted major trophies but always as part of a partnership, as winner of the French Open doubles in 2013 with Elena Vesnina and in mixed doubles at the 2012 US Open with Brazilian Bruno Soares. The Russian, however, has thrived on her own racket in Flushing Meadows in the year's last grand slam by advancing without the loss of a set, eliminating seventh seed Eugenie Bouchard in overbearing heat in the process. Makarova, who won her second career singles title at this year's Pattay City event in Thailand, will meet either two-time defending champion and top seed Serena Williams or 11th seed Flavia Pennetta of Italy for a berth in the final. Azarenka, a two-times winner of the Australian Open, showed some rust from a season marred by foot and knee injures that forced her to withdraw from seven events and sent her ranking plunging from number two to 17th. She also showed some frustration, earning a warning for racket abuse after being broken to fall behind 4-2 in the second set when her backhand tipped the net cord and landed just wide. 'Give credit to my opponent,' the charismatic 24-year-old Belarussian told reporters in a hushed voice. 'She played really well today. Am I disappointed? Yes, but I tried my best.' Frustrated: Azarenka failed to replicate the form she showed in the previous two US Opens . No excuses: Azarenka refused to blame her recent bout of food poisoning on her defeat to Makarova . Azarenka's agent said on Twitter that she had suffered from a case of food poisoning on Tuesday but the 16th seed refused to comment. 'I'm not going to make any excuses,' said Azarenka, who led their head-to-head series 3-2 but had won their previous two matches on hard court. 'She deserves to win. She played much better than me today.' It was an entertaining match between two aggressive, power hitters but Makarova proved much steadier with her service game as she faced just three break points in the match, saving two, and took advantage of six double faults. Azarenka drew first blood, breaking in the fifth game of the first set at 3-2 but Makarova broke right back, and broke again in the 10th game as she took advantage of loose groundstrokes from the Belarussian. Makarova dominated the second set, keeping up the pressure after Azarenka saved four break points in the second game and two more in the fourth to remain level at 2-2. The Russian finally broke through on Azarenka's next serve and clinched the quarter-final by breaking in the final game for an emphatic end to her 87-minute victory.","Russian tennis star Ekaterina Makarova faced just three break points .

"By . Press Association Reporter . Australia captain Michael Clarke has been ruled out of the rest of his side's triangular one-day series after suffering a recurrence of his hamstring injury in the shock defeat to Zimbabwe on Sunday. The 33-year-old will return home to Sydney in order to have the problem assessed and it is likely his captaincy duties will be handed on to George Bailey, who took charge of Australia in their opening two matches of the series in Clarke's absence. Australian team physiotherapist David Beakley said: 'Michael...will not be able to take any further part in the tri-series. Injury: Michael Clarke (right) with Zimbabwe captain Elton Chigumbura (left) before tri-series . Leader: Clarke speaks to his team during a practice session ahead of the tri-series . 'Michael will return to Sydney on Tuesday to undergo scans and further assessment to determine the full extent of the injury.' Clarke missed his side's matches against Zimbabwe and South Africa due to the problem with his hamstring and, playing in his first professional match since March, aggravated it while batting on Sunday. He was forced to retire hurt on 68 and although he re-emerged for the closing stages of his side's innings, the injury is clearly a worry for Australia with the World Cup on home soil only a few months away. The problem only compounds a frustrating day for the tourists, who suffered their first defeat to minnows Zimbabwe in 31 years after a three-wicket loss in Harare.","Australia are currently playing in tri-series with Zimbabwe and South Africa .

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Jenson Button concedes his years of experience have taught him to be 'massively relaxed' about his Formula One future. Ahead of this weekend's Italian Grand Prix at Monza, Button is currently in limbo as he waits for McLaren's top brass to make a decision on the team's driver line-up for next season. Out of contract in a few months' time, Button faces the prospect of his 15-year run in the sport coming to an end. In the balance: Jenson Button's Formula 1 future is uncertain beyond the 2014 season . In the driving seat: Driving his McLaren, Button tours in free practice at Monza ahead of the Italian Grand Prix . Rumours of McLaren attempting to poach Fernando Alonso or Sebastian Vettel, despite both being tied to their respective contracts with Ferrari and Red Bull, have been rife of late. Button, however, takes it all in his stride as he said: 'I've been racing in F1 for 15 years. You go through a lot in your career, you hear a lot of b*******. 'Initially it's annoying, but then you're like 'you know what, I've been here before, been in this situation before, heard it before'. 'So you just get on with your job, and I love racing in Formula One. 'Every time I jump in a car I do the best job I can - and it doesn't matter who it's for or where it is - I do the best for myself, the team and the fans. 'That's not going to change because you never do a half-hearted job, you always do the best you can, you want to beat your team-mate and you want to beat every single guy out there. 'Nothing changes, just the length of time you have available to fulfil your dreams. 'So I'm massively relaxed. I'm always relaxed.' Thinking it over: Despite being contracted to Ferrari, Fernando Alonso has been linked with a shock return to McLaren where he he left under a cloud following a turbulent 2007 season . Proven champion: Current world champion Sebastian Vettel has also been linked with a McLaren move . In a recent interview Button remarked if he had 'to retire at the end of the year, then so be it'. It is the first time he has mentioned the word 'retirement', although claims there was a reason on this occasion. 'When you're asked the question (about his future) so many times you've got to say something different else it gets boring,' said Button. 'Not for you guys, but for me it gets boring. I'm so bored of answering the same questions. 'I said if I wasn't racing at the end of the season, so be it. That's what I said. 'If I'm not racing, so be it. I can't do much about that, but it's not that I'm getting ready because I definitely don't want to retire for many years.' With regard to McLaren's overtures towards Alonso, Button is far from concerned given the Spaniard is contracted to Ferrari through to the end of 2016. McLaren Group CEO Ron Dennis recently stated he is a man who respects contracts, and with Alonso saying he is keen to remain at the Maranello marque, the rumours appear groundless. Button added: 'That doesn't change my cause at all. It doesn't change anything because he was always staying at Ferrari.'","Jenson Button is in last year of his McLaren contract .

For us, It was all about keeping cool and calm and then to pull could away when we needed to. 'Moe (Sbihi) made the call at just the right time and we all responded and the boat just flew.'

"By . Simeon Gholam for MailOnline . Follow @@SimGholam . Chelsea forward Diego Costa has acknowledged that he will need to adapt his style in order to be a success with Spain. The 25-year-old has hit the ground running in the Premier League so far, scoring four times in three games as Jose Mourinho's side have begun the new season with a 100% record, but has struggled to replicate that form with his national side. Costa started the first two games at the World Cup, struggling for form as Spain lost 5-1 to Holland and 2-0 to Chile, before being dropped for their dead rubber victory over Australia in their final encounter.

And after failing to find the back of the net in their underwhelming 1-0 at the hands of Paris in France on Thursday night - with his new Chelsea team-mate Loic Remy netting the winner - Costa has now gone five international games without a goal since he switched allegiances from Brazil. 'I really want to score with Spain,' he told Marca after the game. 'Our game is to have the ball a lot, have a lot of possession. 'I am [aware] that I have to adapt to them. 'Things are going very well for me at Chelsea and that encourages me to keep improving.'

Lewis Hamilton blitzed first practice ahead of the Italian Grand Prix as he set his sights on again reeling in Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg in the battle for the Formula One world title. Unusually, there was no Mercedes lock out of the top two places as instead Hamilton spearheaded a British one-two, with McLaren's Jenson Button second on the timesheet around one of the sport's historic tracks, Monza. Hamilton, though, was in a class of his own as he finished 0.623secs ahead of Button, with Rosberg forced to settle for only third best, with the German 0.808secs down.

In light of what transpired in Belgium a fortnight ago, with Rosberg deliberately opting not to pull out of a collision with Hamilton on lap two which wrecked the Briton's race, the focus has been more intense than usual on the duo. Despite apologising and paying a significant six-figure fine handed down by Mercedes, Rosberg still emerged from the event with a further 18 points more than Hamilton, and is now 29 ahead in the standings. That has placed additional pressure on Hamilton to enjoy a clean weekend, something that has eluded him for some considerable time.

"By . Richard Arrowsmith for MailOnline . Inter Milan coach Walter Mazzarri believes his side can emulate Barcelona and return to winning ways after completing a transitional phase at the San Siro. The Catalans endured a lengthy barren spell before the arrivals of Frank Rijkaard and then Pep Guardiola reversed their fortunes, which included winning the treble in the 2008-09 season, and produced a team regarded by many as the greatest club side in football.

However, Mazzarri is confident that a summer spending spree, which has seen the likes of Nemanja Vidic, Yann M'Vila and Pablo Daniel Osvaldo arrive, will see success return to the club. 'Ours is a project that goes forward in time,' he said at an event at the University of Milan. 'A new cycle has started and no one has pointed out that we're playing with four young players. 'Just like it happened at Barcelona, we will return to winning. At Napoli I demonstrated my ability to carry out a project. My hope is to reach the Champions League right away.'

"By . Mark Wilson For The Daily Mail . Russell Martin is adamant Scotland won’t park the bus against Germany - although the loss of first-choice left-back Andrew Robertson has now left Gordon Strachan with a defensive headache. The national side open their Euro 2016 qualification campaign with a daunting trip to Dortmund on Sunday evening. A full house of almost 66,000 is expected inside the Westfalenstadion for the first competitive game played by Joachim Low’s team since they lifted the World Cup in Brazil. No fear: Scotland's Russell Martin is adamant his nation will not park bus against world champions Germany . Go on a run: The Scotland players will be hoping for a good start to their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign . Norwich City centre-back Martin recognises that Scotland must bring a perfect defensive game if they are to cope with a multi-faceted German threat. The chances of that have lessened, however, after the loss of talented Hull City defender Robertson, who was ruled out on Wednesday due to a calf injury. With Rangers left-back Lee Wallace having been overlooked, the most likely replacement is Norwich’s Steven Whittaker, while Charlie Mulgrew could perhaps move from midfield to cover. Despite the blow - and the injury to another defender, Christophe Berra - Martin believes head coach Strachan will find a way for the Scots to achieve a result. ‘Every team, even the world champions, will have some weaknesses,’ said Martin. ‘The coaching staff here have spent a long time looking at them and we’ll be working on things on the training pitch. ‘The one thing about the manager and his staff is that they are very thorough in terms of studying teams and trying to exploit weaknesses. Fighting fit: Captain Darren Fletcher is set to lead Scotland against the world champions in Dortmund . ‘We all know how good Germany can be, so let’s look at maybe one or two things they don’t do so well. ‘We won’t just sit in. No chance. I think if you do that against a team of Germany’s quality, you are on a hiding to nothing. It would be a very long evening. ‘We are going to try to impose our own game and play the way we want to play. ‘The manager is really positive, as are the lads. We have improved a lot over the past year, so we want to keep that going. We will have a go to try to get a result.’ Germany gave an awesome example of their attacking power in that incredible 7-1 demolition of Brazil in the World Cup semi-finals. ‘I sat watching that game in disbelief, probably the same as everyone else,’ added Martin. ‘It was the most one-sided game I have ever seen in the World Cup. ‘But one thing we are is extremely organised. Everyone knows exactly what their defensive roles are. We are also getting better in attack.’ Pointing the way: Scotland manager Gordon Strachan is aiming to lead his side to a positive result in Germany . Avoiding defeat in Dortmund would be an outstanding start to a Euro 2016 qualification campaign that offers the best chance yet of a first place at a major finals since the France 98 World Cup. Some of the German players are already uncomfortably familiar to Martin. Mesut Ozil scored twice for Arsenal in a 4-1 win over Norwich last season but the defender is not cowed by the prospect of a re-match. ‘I’ve played against Ozil and Lukas Podolski and they are top players,’ said Martin. ‘Playing against them before is a bit of a help but they have good players all over the pitch. We won’t just focus on one or two. On the ball: Midfielder James Morrison is put through his paces at Mar Hall ahead of leaving for Germany . This is how we do it: Morrison listens as Scotland manager Gordon Strachan gives out instructions . ‘Germany have a lot of pace and power but we are used to that as we played Belgium twice (in the last campaign) and they had that, too. ‘There are still weaknesses and we must exploit that. We have some real strengths and need to be positive.’ Meanwhile, Robertson, who has impressed since his summer switch the English Premier League from Dundee United, took to social media on Wednesday night to express his anguish at missing out on facing the Germans. Robertson, who expects to be fit for Hull’s next league match at home on September 15, tweeted: ‘Gutted to be injured but hopefully back for West Ham! Good luck to all the boys.’ Prize guys: (from left) Mario Gotze, Manuel Neuer and Thomas Muller won the World Cup earlier this summer .

"By . Mark Wilson For The Daily Mail . Given the sense of crisis once again engulfing Rangers, it could be tempting to view this on-field revival as a template for how to cure their wider worries. If only things were that simple. A change of personnel and direction, enforced by some bold decision-making, dragged the Ibrox side away from a defeat that would have been deeply damaging even at this early stage of the season. How the Rangers fans who witnessed it must wish the deepening financial concerns could be eased in a similarly swift and decisive way. They are well aware, however, that substituting investors and directors is nowhere near as easy as changing players on the pitch. Leveller: Marius Zaliukas (right) celebrates brining Rangers level . Protest: Rangers fans chanted 'sack the board' despite Saturday's win . Ally McCoist’s half-time introduction of Ian Black and, in particular, David Templeton transformed Rangers’ fortunes and enabled them to hit three second period goals without response. It was a victory that provided cheer on another day of discord. Confirmation that the club is attempting to raise £4million from a share issue just to keep the lights on brought a new wave of anger towards those currently in power. A red card protest was staged in the Broomloan Road stand after 18 and 72 minutes, the first of those accompanied by a ‘Sack the Board’ chant that gained echoes in other areas of the stadium. One protestor held up a banner stating ‘No more faceless investors’ just behind the directors’ box. Further ire was generated when the club declined to state the intentions of chief executive Graham Wallace over a contractual bonus worth up to £315,000. It was revealed in May that Wallace could effectively double his salary in cash or shares by the end of August if certain performance requirements were met. A spokesperson confirmed Wallace had not yet received a bonus but refused to comment further when asked to clarify if it could happen at a future date. It would surely be absurd if any bonuses were taken, given the perilous position Rangers once again find themselves in. But if the past few years at Ibrox have taught us anything, it is that absurdity is no barrier to the possible becoming reality. Off-field issues will dominate in the weeks ahead, yet that does not diminish the importance of events between the white lines. Yesterday evening, McCoist praised his players for maintaining focus amid the supporter protests and general air of turmoil that surrounds the club. More of the same will be required given the hugely impressive start Hearts have made with four successive wins in the Championship. Promotion at the first attempt is a cornerstone of Rangers’ recovery, regardless of who is populating the boardroom, and it clearly isn’t going to be a straightforward task. Back of the net: Bilel Mohsni enjoys scoring for Rangers . Tricky encounter: Iain Russell gives Queen of the South the lead for a second time . Kenny Miller came off the bench to net the clinching fourth goal for McCoist’s men at the weekend and carries the kind of experience that could prove vital over a tense campaign not short on distractions. The former Scotland striker is adamant everyone in the Rangers dressing room is braced for a lengthy scrap, but with full confidence of coming out on top. ‘We never thought it would be a gimme,’ insisted Miller. ‘We are favourites and I think rightly so. ‘I have always said that come May we will win the league. There is no doubt about it. ‘But Hearts, Hibs and this game against Queen of the South have shown that no-one is going to make it easy for us. ‘We are not going to be handed it and we are going to have to earn it. We are going to have work and play better. ‘We are only four games in so you can’t narrow it down to ourselves and Hearts. I thought Hibs were fantastic when they played us in the Petrofac Training Cup. ‘They will be there or thereabouts as well and I think Queen of the South have started great. ‘Yes, we beat them but I thought they can be proud about coming here and playing the way they played especially in that first half. ‘It is definitely not a gimme because it is going to be long and hard. But with the quality we have in that dressing room, we firmly believe that come May we will be at the top.’ To do so, Rangers recognise they will have to improve upon the dismal quality of defending shown in the opening period. Queens took the lead after 22 minutes when Daniel Carmichael galloped into space on the right and delivered a low cross for Gavin Reilly. He had the freedom required to take a touch before clipping a shot beyond Steve Simonsen. Rangers levelled via a looping header from Marius Zaliukas – although visiting manager Jim McIntyre felt goalkeeper Zander Clark was fouled on the line by Bilel Mohsni – but were behind again after 36 minutes. Zaliukas was woeful as he let Reilly in behind him to square for Iain Russell. Again, there was zero pressure on the finisher as he stuck the ball into the bottom corner. It prompted a double switch at the break, with Zaliukas and the utterly ineffective Arnold Peralta replaced by Black and Templeton. Close attentions: Rangers' Ian Black is bundled over by opponent Kevin Dzierzawski . Three points: Kris Boyd congratulates goalscorer Zaliukas . Thanks: Rangers pair Nicky Law and Kenny Miller pay tribute to the Ibrox support . The latter took barely a minute to justify his inclusion. Capitalising on a slip from Kevin Holt, Templeton cut inside along the edge of the area and dispatched a tremendous left-foot drive into the net. It was precisely what Rangers needed to lift them from their torpor and a reminder of the talent Templeton possesses. Sadly for the former Hearts winger, an ankle injury forced his replacement five minutes from the end. Mohnsi then atoned for some of his earlier defending by meeting a Nicky Law corner with a diving header that squirmed its way beyond Clark to put his side in front for the first time. Queens – missing seven players through injury - couldn’t muster the same threat as in the opening period and Miller sealed the result within 60 seconds of replacing Templeton. Latching onto a head flick from Boyd, he scampered through to dink over Clark for the first competitive goal of his third stint at Rangers.","Ian Black and David Templeton come off the bench to turn the game around for Rangers .

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Max Chilton has confirmed his race seat with Marussia is guaranteed until the end of the season. A fortnight ago Chilton's F1 career appeared in limbo after he was axed from the Belgian Grand Prix due to 'contractual issues', with American Alexander Rossi stepping in. A statement from his management, however, muddied the waters as it suggested the 23-year-old had 'volunteered' to give up his seat to aid the team's financial cause. Future: Brit Chilton's team next season is unclear, after he didn't drive for Marussia last week in Belgium . What next? Chilton's Marussia future is in doubt after he was axed from the Belgian Grand Prix last week . Come Friday morning, it was announced that with the exception of the first practice session at Spa, Chilton would again be driving. Asked whether he would be behind the wheel for the final seven grands prix, Chilton replied: . 'Yes. What happened was a commercial decision which got changed, and we are now back to normal. 'It's all been sorted out and it's now in the past. We're now looking forward as we're still in an amazing position as a team. 'The best thing we can do now is focus on staying ahead of Sauber.' As for next season, that remains up in the air, with Chilton adding ahead of this weekend's Italian Grand Prix: 'All I can do is the best job I can. 'I had a good start to the year, but then a couple of races which haven't been particularly great. 'But I'm always quick here, and there are a couple of tracks coming up I like, so the main thing I can do to help myself for next year is to put in some good performances.' Committed: Chilton remains keen on securing a new deal at Marussia . Behind the scenes, that is up to Chilton's management to try to strike a new deal with the team. At present Chilton remains tied in to an Enterprise Initiative Scheme whereby he has 30 to 40 backers, and in return he has given up part of his future earnings. 'That's still in place and still going strong,' said Chilton. 'You always have to go back to base for the following year, but I'm sure between all those people it will be fine. 'I will leave it to my management, and all they can do is talk to the right people and try to get a deal done before the end of the year. 'It's always nice as a driver to know you've something for the following year before the final race.' Chilton is confident that what happened at Spa has not jeopardised his standing or position in the team. 'No, not at all,' insisted Chilton. 'At the end of the day it was a commercial decision made by both parties, something that was agreed. 'From the outside it looked like it was a bit messy, but from the inside we knew what was going on.

Such is the clamor for tickets for Coventry City's return to the Ricoh Arena that one supporter was prepared to camp outside the box office on Wednesday night. The Sky Blues will return to the city when they face Gillingham this weekend after more than a year playing their games in Northampton. But the club's loyal follower - known simply as 'Andy' - was saved from a night in the cold when a fellow City fan arrived at the ground to offer his spare ticket after hearing the story on Twitter. Front of the queue: Andy prepares for a night outside the ticket office with a cup of tea . Good Samaritan: A fellow Sky Blues supporter arrived to give Andy his spare ticket . Heading home: Coventry are to return to the Ricoh Arena after playing in Northampton for more than a year . Remaining tickets have been limited to two per person to deal with the demand from excited supporters. Steve Waggott, chief executive of Coventry City Football Club, said: 'You can feel the positivity around the city about our return to the Ricoh and long may that continue. 'Everyone is looking forward to Friday night and what should be a great occasion for the club and the city.' The League One side have ended their dispute with the stadium's owners, Arena Coventry Limited (ACL), and have reached an agreement to head back to the stadium they played in between 2005 and 2013. Back to where they belong: A fan protests at the Ricoh in 2013, prior to Coventry's move . Home from home: Coventry take on Barnsley earlier this month at their adopted home in Northampton . The two-year deal, with an option for an extra two years, should see the Sky Blues play at the Ricoh in their next home fixture, which is against Gillingham on 6 September. The deal was struck after Coventry owners Sisu paid ACL £471,192 via the Football League last week, with the money going towards compensation and unpaid rent. ACL had previously said it would not discuss a return until it received money owed by the club after they went into administration last year. Sisu and ACL first came into conflict in April 2012 when Coventry started to withhold what they felt was unreasonable rent from the stadium operators. The Sky Blues then agreed a three-year groundshare deal with Northampton - 35 miles away - with an option of a further two years, and the Cobblers will be due compensation after the early end of the deal. A year's break: Coventry spent last season playing in front of small crowds at Northampton's   Sixfields Stadium . Versatile: The Ricoh Arena has been used for other events, such as football matches during the 2012 Olympics . 'We are delighted to get this deal done and I am sure every supporter of Coventry City will be thrilled with this news. 'We are under no illusion what a difficult 12 months it has been for the supporters and that was uppermost in our thinking as we worked to get this deal done. 'There has had to be compromise on both sides and the commercial details of the deal will remain confidential. 'Now it is all about looking forward to a really exciting season back in the community and with a real chance of success. I am sure every supporter will want to give Steven Pressley, his staff and players their full backing for the season at the Ricoh. 'Logistically, it's going to mean a huge amount of work between now and the first game back and we would ask supporters to bear with us as all of our efforts up to now have been in getting this deal over the line to get us back to Coventry as soon as possible. 'We will announce details around tickets, Season Tickets and other information as soon as we can next week but we hope to be back at the Ricoh for the clash with Gillingham. We will keep supporters fully informed of progress to that aim. 'Can I also take this opportunity of thanking Chris Robinson, Chair of ACL, for the professional manner he has conducted our lengthy discussions to reach this agreement.'","Coventry City will return to the Ricoh Arena on Friday after more than a year away .

"By . Press Association Reporter . Robert Lewandowski's first Bundesliga goal for Bayern Munich was not enough to earn the champions victory as they had to settle for a 1-1 draw at Schalke. The Polish striker, who moved to the Allianz Arena from Borussia Dortmund in the summer, opened his account after only 10 minutes with a close-range finish. But Bayern, for whom new signing Xabi Alonso made his debut in midfield, could not add to their tally and were pegged back by Benedikt Howedes 62nd-minute leveller. Disappointing: Bayern Munich were held 1-1 away at Schalke despite taking the lead . It left Bayer Leverkusen as the only team with two wins from two after they scored four second-half goals to win 4-2 at home to Hertha Berlin. They had to come from behind twice, Tin Jedvaj's own goal putting Hertha ahead 24 minutes before he equalised five minutes after the break. Julian Schieber's third goal of the season restored the visitors' advantage, but goals from Emir Spahic, Julian Brandt and Karim Bellarabi turned the match on its head.

"By . Kit Holden . According to a report in Germany, Bayern Munich want a refund on new signing Mehdi Benatia, because he doesn't speak any Spanish. It was satire, of course. With their current problems at the back, Bayern are over the moon to finally have Benatia among their ranks. But the joke captures the feeling in Bavaria that Bayern are becoming increasingly hispanic. This has been a Spanish summer for Bayern in the transfer market. Pepe Reina has been drafted in as a reserve goalkeeper, Juan Bernat was signed from Valencia, and Xabi Alonso has completed a move to the German champions. On top of that, Bayern have also shown interest in Athletic Bilbao's Ander Iturraspe. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Pep Guardiola hail new signing Xabi Alonso . Under fire: Pep Guardiola faces accusations from some German critics of making Bayern Munich too Spanish . In with the old: Legendary Spain midfielder Xabi Alonso (left) arrives for his Bayern medical on Thursday . Out with the new: Germany playmaker Toni Kroos (right) has departed Bayern for Real Madrid . That's not to mention the Spaniards who were already in the Bayern squad. Part of the reason for Bayern's interest in the aforementioned players are the injuries to Thiago Alcantara and Javi Martinez. Martinez, of course, was signed by former coach Jupp Heynckes, himself a connoisseur of Spanish football. The rest, most notably Thiago, are products of the Guardiola era. An era which many are now concerned is too Spanish influenced. Bayern legend Lothar Matthaus claimed last May that Guardiola 'doesn't understand the German football mentality', while a Spanish journalist recently wrote in the Munich tabloid TZ that the club are 'in danger of losing their identity'. Even Bernat, one of Bayern's new Spaniards, warned that 'a Spanish faction in the squad would be dangerous'. The criticism is a little unfair. Guardiola may have signed a host of Spanish players, and even brought two former Barcelona colleagues into his coaching staff, but the vast majority of his entourage remains German. He has also continued to build around key German players such as Bastian Schweinsteiger, Thomas Muller and Manuel Neuer. In face of a defensive catastrophe, he has put his faith in Holger Badstuber, a homegrown player who has just returned from nearly two years of injury. Feeling the pressure? Pep Guardiola (left) gets aggressive towards Thomas Muller (second right) in training . Shove off: Bayern's boss was filmed pushing the German forward earlier this week . As for Bayern's identity, Guardiola is arguably just continuing a tradition which Bayern have upheld since rising to dominance in the 70s. Reinforcement in Munich always arrives through a mixture of financial muscle and a strong youth system. Guardiola's Spanish-focused activity in the transfer market must be seen in the context of his close work with the Bayern youth system. That work has borne fruit in recent months with the emergence into the first team of youngsters Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Gianluca Gaudino. When it comes to the transfer market, though, there is no denying Guardiola's penchant for Spain above all else. The departure of German World Cup hero Toni Kroos is a classic example. Though Guardiola did not want to lose the player, his solution to the problem came in the form of a Spaniard, Bernat. The signing from Valencia will now play at left back, with the versatile Austrian David Alaba being redeployed in midfield to fill the gap left by Kroos. Even aside from personnel, though, there are worries that Guardiola's approach is still too Spanish. Honorary president Franz Beckenbauer voiced concerns last spring that Guardiola's tactical philosophy didn't suit Bayern. Cheers: Guardiola is showered in beer by Jerome Boateng after winning the Bundesliga last season . Critic: Franz Beckenbauer is not a fan of tiki-taka . 'They play like Barcelona, where even standing on the goal-line they play the ball backwards' Beckenbauer moaned on Sky TV. The comment provoked an indignant defence from Guardiola at the time, but details have since emerged that he is responsive to that criticism, and is keen to show Bayern are not simply a remodelled Barcelona. In pre-release extracts from a new biography, Guardiola is quoted saying 'I hate tiki-taka'. 'Tiki-taka is when you play the ball only in order to play it again. This doesn't interest us. What we need is the central midfielders and the defence to be aggressive going forward and to break the opposing ranks. We need to keep the ball on one side, so as to free space to attack on the other. That is our game. Not this pointless tiki-taka.' The 'pointless' version of tiki-taka is often what Bayern were caught playing last season. With Robert Lewandowski now added to their ranks, Guardiola will hope that his attack has more of a cutting edge this season. Guardiola is walking a tightrope, and adapting himself to a new football culture. He speaks passable German already, but the next stage is much more difficult. The next stage is to ensure his style can be as German as it is Spanish; a style of tiki-taka focused on the goal, or to use the German word, the Tor. It is, as Bild put it on Thursday, a case of Tik-Tak-Tor . VIDEO Bayern not expecting to stroll past slumping Schalke .","Bayern Munich have signed Xabi Alonso from Real Madrid .

"By . Wills Robinson . Texting from behind the wheel could be made impossible after Apple launched plans to install a device that could stop drivers from sending messages. The electronic giants have filed a patent for a system that could bar access to an iPhone's messaging apps while a user is driving. Sensors installed in phones would be able to detect the speed of the vehicle and work out where someone was sitting. This would allow passengers to send messages without any restrictions. Block: The new plans by Apple include senors installed in a phone or the vehicle itself that would stop a driver sending a message when travelling at speed . Messaging at the wheel is hard to detect and has become so common that many believe a law barring it would not make a difference. Documents filed on behalf of Apple in the US suggest they are looking to develop 'lockout mechanisms that disable the ability of a handheld computing device to perform certain functions, such as texting, while one is driving'. Other plans include technology installed in the car that would block out phone signals from outside. In the patent, they suggest police find it hard to catch drivers who are texting because the device 'can be used out of sight'. Technology: The device would stop drivers being able to access the iPhone's messaging app . Paul Watters, the head of motoring policy for the AA, told The Times: 'Apple could have the power to change the culture behind texting and driving, if it works and is intuitive. That would be a very good step.' He said that research by the AA suggested that texting was an addiction 'that is very hard to break even when in the car'. A study by Brake, the road safety charity, suggested that texting increased the risk of crashing 23 times and slowed a drivers reaction by more than a third.","Electronic giants would use sensors to bar messaging apps .

'But I promise that I will always have Leeds United at heart and will do my very best to make the club successful no matter how long it takes. 'We have to realise though that it will be a hard job to get the club back to where we want it to be, but together we will do that. 'Now, let us join together and support the team and Neil Redfearn.'

"By . Nick Mashiter, Press Association . Boss Steven Pressley insists Coventry's homecoming will be as big as their FA Cup triumph. The Sky Blues will return to the Ricoh Arena on Friday to host Gillingham, after over a year of playing in Northampton. The club ended a rent dispute with the stadium's owners, Arena Coventry Limited, last month to make the switch possible. Pleased as punch: Coventry boss Steven Pressley can't wait for his side to return to the Ricoh Arena . And Pressley believes it is one of the most monumental days in the club's history since they won the FA Cup in 1987. 'With the emotions, without doubt. It's maybe the most emotional day since winning FA Cup,' he said with the club expecting over 25,000 fans. 'It's a night when we have responsibility to entice supporters back on a regular basis. 'It's a big club starved of success for too long. Around the ground there are lots of subliminal messages and references to the cup-winning team and a return to the Ricoh is a major step in our history. Home sweet home: Coventry haven't played at their Ricoh Arena for over a year due to a rent dispute . 'Everything surrounding the club at the moment typifies how important the club is to the city. We've had two or three thousand camping out to get tickets. It will be a fantastic atmosphere and we can show everyone the potential of this football club.' The players spent time at the stadium on Thursday afternoon to reacquaint themselves with it and Pressley admitted they cannot let the occasion affect them. He said: 'We must focus on our gameplan. We'll arrive on Friday night and feel the occasion. That's what big games are. It's a contrast to last year's arrival at Sixfields where there wasn't really an atmosphere.

My goal is that we apply ourselves and if we give that I'll be a happy man. 'We've been working in the football department to put the foundations in place.

Arsene Wenger's team missed a succession of chances to put the qualifier beyond the reach of Besiktas following a goalless draw in the first leg in Istanbul, with a 1-0 win putting Arsenal through. Sanchez, Santi Cazorla and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain failed to score when it was harder to miss amid the mayhem of a roller-coaster second half in which Mathieu Debuchy was sent off for collecting a second yellow card. Here, Matt Barlow gives his verdict on the performance of the players. VIDEO Scroll down for Alexis Sanchez: I have joined Arsenal to win titles . ARSENAL . WOJCIECH SZCZESNY: Rarely extended but his hands were tidy and he patrolled his penalty box with authority, which he doesn’t always do. Booked for time-wasting. 6.5. MATHIEU DEBUCHY: Fluent as ever in attack and unreliable in defence. Good interception to deny Ba. Booked for a needless shoulder barge and sent off for halting a Besiktas counter-attack. 5.5. PER MERTESACKER: His presence and experience brings composure to the Arsenal back-four. They played deeper with him in control but Ba was not the threat he was in Istanbul. 6.5. Red card: Arsenal's Mathieu Debuchy (right) is sent off by referee Pedro Proenca . LAURENT KOSCIELNY: Generally adds mobility and extra snap in the tackle. Aggressive and spirited and good chemistry with Mertesacker. 7. NACHO MONREAL: A concern for Arsenal in the absence of Kieran Gibbs but very solid in defence. Offered little protection by Ozil. 6. MATHIEU FLAMINI: Aggressive and committed but without the assurance of Arteta. Prone to conceding free-kicks in dangerous areas. Slip almost lets in Ba in the second half. 6. Assured: Nacho Monreal (right) was solid in defence against Besiktas on Wednesday . ALEX OXLADE CHAMBERLAIN: Adds energy and urgency to Arsenal. Most effective early on. Missed good chance to make it 2-0. 6.5. SANTI CAZORLA: Quiet by his standards playing in a more central role. Rarely on the ball in the most dangerous areas and enjoyed best spell after Arsenal went to down 10. 6. JACK WILSHERE: Influential if erratic. Slid a good chance wide early on and escaped a penalty for a challenge on Motta. Key role in the goal and the one who offered drive from midfield. 7. Erratic: Jack Wilshere (right) had a key role in goal but was lucky not to give away a penalty . MESUT OZIL: Nice touches, as always, including a role in the goal, but infuriating at times. Playing wide exposes his deficiencies in defence. Weak in the tackle. 5.5. ALEXIS SANCHEZ: His first Arsenal goal was precious. Worked hard. Quick and strong. But he does not look like the answer at centre-forward in Giroud’s absence. 7.5. SUBS: Chambers for Ozil (76mins) booked for coming on in the wrong fashion as Wenger restructured after going to 10 men. UNUSED: MARTINEZ, COQUELIN, ROSICKY, PODOLSKI, SANOGO, CAMPBELL. MANAGER ARSENE WENGER: Not vintage Arsenal by any means but without captain Arteta and the main sources of goals, Ramsey and Giroud, his team got the job done, which was the main thing. 6.5. Job done: Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger endured an anxious night at the Emirates . BESIKTAS: ZENGIN 6; KOYBASI 6, FRANCO 6, GULUM 6.5, MOTTA 6; HUTCHINSON 6.5, OZYAKUP 5, KAVLAK 7 (UYSAL 76, 5); PEKTEMEK 5.5 (TOSUN 87), BA 5.5, SAHAN 6 (TORE, 60, 5). SUBS: GONEN, KURTULUS, SIVOK, KOYUNLU. BOOKINGS: KAVLAK, OZYAKUP, FRANCO, HUTCHINSON, UYSAL, TORE. MANAGER SLAVEN BILIC 6. REF: PEDRO PROENCA: It was an unruly affair with lots of robust midfield challenges simmering tension. He booked six Besiktas players and perfectly entitled to send off Debuchy but he made mistakes, including two strong penalty calls by the visitors. 5.

"By . Phil Duncan for MailOnline . Follow @@PhilDuncanF1 . Wayne Rooney has been unveiled as the new England captain. The 28-year-old Manchester United skipper succeeds Steven Gerrard after the Liverpool star retired from international duty following England's disappointing World Cup campaign in Brazil. Lampard, England's vice-captain at last summer's World Cup where the Three Lions failed to win a game, also announced his retirement earlier this week. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roy Hodgdson: Wayne Rooney as captain not guaranteed game . Moving forward: Wayne Rooney has been handed the England captaincy by manager Roy Hodgson . Leading from the front: Rooney has been named Manchester United captain by Louis van Gaal . Rooney has already captained England and was handed the armband for the first time in their World Cup qualifier against San Marino in October 2012. 'Wayne is an obvious choice for his honesty, commitment to the cause, his experience, the fact he has already captained England in the past,' Roy Hodgson said. 'Now of course he's got that responsibility at Manchester United as well. All those factors weighed into my thought process and I'm pleased to be able to say I've been able to offer it to him. I had a long conversation with him and he's prepared to accept the pressures the England captaincy brings.' Asked if he expected the move to spur Rooney on to even greater heights, however, Hodgson demurred. 'I try to shy away from that,' he said. 'I think it's dangerous to demand that of people. We see so often in the past it takes you on to a new level but with 95 caps and all the goals he's scored, all the things he's done, we've already seen he's prepared to take responsibility. 'We hope he continues to push on, he continues to play well and he shoulders the responsibility of the captaincy as well as the other captains before him.' Rooney told thefa.com: 'To be named as England captain is a dream come true for me personally and of course my family, . 'It is something that I will take massive pride in doing. 'As a kid I always loved watching a big England game on the television. Back then I had a burning ambition to play for my country. To be appointed captain is beyond my wildest dreams. 'I would obviously like to thank Roy and the coaching staff for having the belief and confidence in me to do the job.' Passing it on: Roy Hodgson was left in no doubt that Rooney was the right man to lead the new England . Rooney was backed for the job by predecessor Gerrard, and will consult his fellow Liverpudlian before getting stuck into his new task. 'I intend to speak with Steven about different aspects of the role,' Rooney said. 'We had a great relationship from the moment we played together for our country and right up to our final game in Brazil. I am sure if ever I need to seek his advice he will be there to help.' Rooney has had disciplinary problems in the past, but Hodgson said he had not concerned himself with those issues. 'I've got to judge him on the two years I've been with him,' Hodgson said. 'It's not for me to look back too much into the past and whatever misdemeanours the player may have had. 'In the two years with me I've had no reason whatsoever to question anything about his character or desire to play for his country or his wholehearted willingness to offer himself in every situation. 'I'm not concerned about anything else but he has that baggage with him and he will have to accept that as an added part of the pressure. You can't draw a line under the past.'

"By . Steve Keating, Reuters . World number one Novak Djokovic barely worked up a good sweat on another sizzling day at the U.S. Open as he strolled past Paul-Henri Mathieu 6-1 6-3 6-0 and into the third round of the year's final grand slam on Thursday. Djokovic, who has reached the Flushing Meadows final each of the last four years and won it all in 2011, needed just 88 minutes to dismiss the veteran Frenchman on a gusty Arthur Ashe Stadium court. The Wimbledon champion broke Mathieu to open the match and never eased off the gas as he swept through the last seven games to clinch an emphatic win. No sweat: World No 1 Novak Djokovic had little trouble dispatching Paul-Henri Mathieu at the US Open . 'I have nothing to complain about, I wanted to get my job done as quick as possible,' said Djokovic. 'I don't feel like I need to play long matches to get into the groove. 'I mean, I feel that I'm hitting the ball very well. Second match even better than the first one. 'Under the circumstances I think I came up with a very good performance. Stayed mentally tough and did not allow myself to get frustrated because of the wind and conditions that were obviously very tough for both of us.' It has been a smooth start to U.S. Open for Djokovic, who opened his campaign with an equally dominant display as he eased past Argentine Diego Schwartzman in straight sets . Poor: Paul-Henri Mathieu was beaten for the loss of just four games in the second round at Flushing Meadows . But things should get tougher in the third round where the Serb will run into big-hitting American Sam Querrey, who advanced with a 6-3 6-4 6-4 win over 28th seed Guillermo Garcia-Lopez of Spain. 'It's logical to expect that every next match that you play in a grand slam will get tougher,' said Djokovic. 'Sam is playing in front of his crowd. I'm sure that he's going to have some good support. 'But on the other hand, if we get to play on centre court, maybe night session, that's where my experience kicks in, I think. 'I have had a lot of matches, night sessions if we get to play, as I said, and (I will) try to neutralise his serve that is his big weapon. If he serves well, he's very dangerous.' Djokovic, who had won only two matches in the hard court run-up to Flushing Meadows after getting married just days after his Wimbledon triumph, has looked like his old dominating self. Playing his first grand slam as a married man, Djokovic, who is also about to become a first-time father, had talked about a shift in priorities but underscored that he is still fully focused on the task at hand when he steps onto the court. Home from home: Serbian star Novak Djokovic has reached the last four finals at the US Open . 'My focus is there. I don't understand how the people really got what I said, but I don't think there is anything wrong,' said Djokovic. 'Actually, I think it would be much (more) wrong if my tennis is in front of my baby and my wife. 'I think there is no question about it. My full priorities and commitments and energy go to my family as much as I need to, but that doesn't mean that I'm not going to play tournaments or not going to continue on doing what I was doing so far. 'Of course I'm doing everything that I can, respecting the same daily routines that I had for many years with my team and it's working well. I have big support from my wife, from my family, from my team. We are all on the same page.'

In his programme notes, he told fans he hoped to be back in action for the big Barclays Premier League clash against Manchester City on September 13. Arteta hurt his ankle in a clash with Demba Ba in the first leg against Besiktas. Arteta said: ‘I am trying to work as hard as I can, even when I am resting. I hope to be back for the Man City game and I’ll do everything I can to be there.’ Injured: Mikel Arteta hurt his ankle in Arsenal's first leg of their Champions League play-off against Besiktas . Tough night for Bilic . Slaven Bilic appeared agitated and confused like a caged beast as he prowled around behind the corporate glass of the Emirates Stadium’s VIP areas before the game, the coach having been banned after his dismissal in the first leg. His assistant Nikola Jurcevic took his place on the touchline but Bilic was writhing in his seat, chewing his fist. Caged animal: Slaven Bilic was sitting in the Emirates stands after he was sent off during the first leg . VIDEO We pushed Arsenal all the way - Bilic . Arsene Wenger was not happy with some of the physical attention from Besiktas in Istanbul and he was on his feet to complain again in the first half as the Turkish team started with the same aggressive intent. Why should opponents make it easy for Arsenal? Although perhaps Veli Kavlak took it a bit far, he was booked for dissent after confronting referee Pedro Proenca. Zigic deal doesn’t have appeal to Arsene . There has been a stampede worthy of a new Primark store since it became clear Olivier Giroud would be out until the new year, with agents offering centre forwards ranging in quality from Rademal Falcao (wanted by Real Madrid and very expensive) to Nikola Zigic (not wanted by Birmingham and also very expensive). Zigic’s agent Milan Calasan said: ‘Wenger called me and told me he wants to bring Zigic to Arsenal. You cannot reject an offer like that but Zigic is the one who must decide.’ However, asked about the possibility of signing the 6ft 7in Serbian, Wenger responded: ‘Who? Zigic? No.’ Wanted: Radamel Falcao has been offered to Arsenal along with Nikola Zigic, who isn't wanted at Birmingham .","Arteta hurt his ankle in a clash with Demba Ba in the first leg at Besiktas .

"By . Eleanor Crooks . Borna Coric announced himself as a coming force in men's tennis by knocking out Lukas Rosol in the opening round of the US Open. The 17-year-old Croatian was marked out as one to watch a number of years ago and all indications are that he is the real deal. Coric came through qualifying to reach the main draw at a grand slam for the first time only a year after winning the junior title at Flushing Meadows. Huge win: 17-year-old Borna Coric can't hide his delight at thrashing Lukas Rosol in straight sets in New York . Rosol, the 29th seed, won an ATP Tour title in Winston-Salem on Saturday but Coric dominated the clash, winning 6-4 6-1 6-2. The teenager, who is ranked 204th in the world, said: 'It's an amazing feeling. I came here and I was only thinking about getting in the main draw. That was my first goal. 'I said to myself, ""if I achieve that, that's going to be perfect"". Now actually winning against a guy who is top 30, it's just unbelievable. Fallen seed: Rosol was the 29th seed at Flushing Meadow but lost in straight sets to Coric 6-4 6-1 6-2 . Future star: The Croatian junior is currently at 204 in the world rankings but will surely rise up quickly . Expectation: The teenager has been working with Croatian greats such as Goran Ivanisevic and Ivan Ljubicic . 'I don't have any pressure. If everyone is looking at me, I'm even more excited about everything because I'm going to prove to everyone that I'm a good player.' After Nick Kyrgios' run at Wimbledon, where the 19-year-old beat Rafael Nadal to reach the quarter-finals, this is another sign that the next generation may break through significantly faster than their predecessors. 'It's unbelievable from him,' said Coric of Kyrgios' exploits. 'It doesn't mean anything to me but it showed that younger players can play with the top 10 or top 20.' Coric has a British coach, Ryan Jones, and splits his time between Croatia and London. He has also been getting tips from some of the greats of Croatian tennis, including Goran Ivanisevic, Ivan Ljubicic and Marin Cilic. Coric is not the only teenage talent making waves from the country, with Donna Vekic and Ana Konjuh ones to watch on the women's side. 'I think it's because in Croatia it's not so easy,' he said. 'We don't have the best conditions to train. We don't have a lot of money. So you need to be tough if you want to make it. We are not spoiled. We are working hard.' Example: Coric believes the success of fellow teenager Nick Kyrgios proves the younger generation are ready . Coric next meets Victor Estrella Burgos from the Dominican Republic, who also posted his first ever grand slam win, but at the age of 34. Fourth seed David Ferrer dropped a set to Bosnia's Damir Dzumhur but recovered to win 6-1 6-2 2-6 6-2. John Isner once again leads American hopes in the men's tournament and he began his campaign with a 7-6 (7/5) 6-2 7-6 (7/2) win over American college champion Marcos Giron. It has been a tough few years for US men's tennis and last year no home player reached the fourth round for the first time in the tournament's long history. Junior Champion: Coric won the boys title at Flushing Meadows last year but is now on the main tour . Isner, the only American seed, said: 'I try not to focus on some of the negative things that people say about American tennis. 'I know I get the brunt of it a lot, because if I win and play well it's because I have a big serve and I can hit my forehand pretty well and that's it. But if I lose, it's because that's all I can do. Sometimes I feel like I can't win no matter what. 'I know what I'm capable of, but it's up to me to play well and advance in this tournament.' Tenth seed Kei Nishikori has been sidelined by a toe injury but shook off any rust quickly in a 6-2 6-4 6-2 win over Wayne Odesnik, while there were also straight-sets wins for Richard Gasquet and Fabio Fognini.

Spain international Xabi Alonso has announced his retirement from international football after 114 games, two European Championships, and one World Cup. The former Liverpool midfielder will be 33 in November and after playing in three World Cups he has decided to concentrate on his club career, following Spain's other X-man Xavi into international retirement. In an open letter to the Spanish FA Alonso said: 'The hardest thing is to know when to say goodbye, but after it giving it a lot of thought, I believe the time has come.' Loyal servant: Xabi Alonso, 32, has announced his retirement from international football . 'I have had a glorious time with Spain that started more than 11 years ago, including me forming part of an historic generation which realised the dream of millions of fans, achieving the unique feat of winning the World Cup and two European Championships in four years. He paid tribute to his various international coaches, including Inaki Saez, 'the unforgettable' Luis Aragones and Vicente del Bosque. '[They] are people who have helped me improve in the right way both professionally and personally,' he said. 'I can't count all the team-mates with whom I've worn this shirt, but I want to thank each and every one for all they have taught me during this unforgettable stage of my life.' Sad end: Alonso's international career ends after defending champions Spain's disastrous Brazil World Cup . Illustrious: After making his debut in 2003 (2003), Alonso won three major trophies with Spain . Kick in the guts: Alonso was famously kicked by Holland's Nigel De Jong during the 2010 World Cup final . And he also thanked the three clubs he has served adding: 'Real Sociedad, Liverpool and Real Madrid opened the doors to international football to me and they always helped and supported me.' 'Finally, I want to convey my sincere thanks to the fans,' he added. 'We shared the same dreams and enjoyed the glory together. I have experienced many unforgettable moments and you guys have been the protagonists. 'I want to wish luck to everybody who continues to fight for this shirt, holding the absolute conviction that we will experience glory once again.' Dead rubber: Alonso's last game for Spain was with nothing to play for but pride against Australia . Current Spain coach Del Bosque highlighted the importance of Alonso to the nation's recent triumphs. He told sefutbol.com: 'It's very difficult to improve on what he has done. 'Together with his peers, he leaves behind a great legacy. He has been a great professional. 'The coaching staff and I hold him in great esteem and his behaviour has been impeccable for all this time.' The international retirement of Xavi and Xabi coincides with Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard's decision to quit the England team, though with Sergi Busquets, Thiago, Andres Iniesta, Koke, Javi Martinez and Ander Herrera they will feel slightly more protected against the loss of such international heavyweights.

"By . Adam Shergold . The elite of European football will gather in Monte Carlo on Thursday evening to discover their opponents in the Champions League group stage. It is typically an occasion of pageantry and presentations as the continental football season gets into full swing. Here's your complete guide to the occasion. When and where is the draw taking place? The Champions League group stage draw will take place on Thursday, with the ceremony getting underway at 4.45pm UK time. It will take place at the Grimaldi Forum in sunny Monaco. Who's in the draw? Arsenal 1-0 Besiktas (agg 1-0) Athletic Bilbao 3-1 Napoli (agg 4-2) Bayer Leverkusen 4-0 Copenhagen (agg 7-2) Ludogerets  1-0 Steaua Bucharest (agg 1-1) Ludogorets won 6-5 on penalties AET . Malmo 3-0 Red Bull Salzburg (agg 4-2) The group stage consists of eight groups of four teams, so there will be 32 participants in all. 22 of those   automatically qualified for the group stage by finishing high in their respective leagues last season. These teams are: Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea, Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, Schalke 04, Juventus, Roma, Benfica, Sporting Lisbon, Paris Saint-Germain, Monaco, Shakhtar Donetsk, CSKA Moscow, Ajax, Galatasaray, Anderlecht, Olympiacos and Basel. These clubs are joined by 10 more who have advanced from the play-off round. Those who have made their way via this route  are: Maribor, APOEL, BATE Borisov, Zenit Saint Petersburg, Porto, Arsenal, Athletic Bilbao, Bayer Leverkusen, Malmo and Ludogorets. Team to beat: Holders Real Madrid will be looking to win a record 11th Champions League title . Minnows: Maribor are in the Champions League draw after they beat Celtic 2-1 on aggregrate . How does the draw work? To ensure a fair draw, the 32 teams are split into four pots based on the 2014 UEFA club coefficients. The coefficients are determined by the results of each club in the Champions League and Europa League over the last five seasons, plus the coefficient of their national association. The clubs receive two points for a win, one for a draw and nothing for a defeat. So pot one will contain the strongest teams, including Real Madrid, who are the defending champions, Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Chelsea and Arsenal. Juggernaut: The 2013 winners Bayern Munich will be among the top seeds in Thursday's draw . World's best: Lionel Messi will be hoping to inspire Barcelona to their fifth Champions League crown . But the strength of the competition means there are usually top teams lurking in the other pots. Pot two contains Borussia Dortmund, Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City. Liverpool are in pot three. The one stipulation is that teams from the same country cannot be drawn together. So there will be no Chelsea against City or Liverpool, for example. On the ball: Paris Saint-Germain striker Edinson Cavani will be hoping to fire them to European glory . What happens then? A computer then determines the full list of fixtures and travel plans can be made by the clubs accordingly. It's a round robin format in the group stage, with each team playing the other three home and away. Here are the dates for your diary: Matchday One - September 16/17; . Matchday Two - September 30/October 1; . Matchday Three - October 21/22; . Matchday Four - November 4/5; . Matchday Five - November 25/26; . Matchday Six - December 9/10. Where can I watch the draw? It will be screened live on Sky Sports News and British Eurosport, as well as the UEFA website. You can also follow it all live here on MailOnline. What would be a good and bad draw for the English sides? Manchester City . Being relatively new to the Champions League stage, City are in pot two and so they will face one of Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Benfica, Atletico Madrid or Porto in their group. A nightmare draw for Manuel Pellegrini's men would be, say, Real Madrid, Galatasaray and Roma. The ideal draw would see them against Porto, CSKA Moscow and APOEL. Food for thought: Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini will be hoping for a kind draw on Thursday . Predator: Star striker Sergio Aguero will play a key role in City's bid to win the Champions League . Chelsea . Winners of the trophy in 2012 and regular semi-finalists, Chelsea are firmly entrenched in pot one. However, this doesn't necessarily mean it'll be a straightforward draw. Their nightmare combination would be with Paris Saint-Germain, Galatasaray and Roma. They did, though, beat the first two of those teams on their way to the semis last season. The simplest draw for Jose Mourinho's men would be Basle, CSKA Moscow and APOEL. Happy memories: Chelsea won their only Champions League trophy during the 2011/12 season . Liverpool . Returning to the Champions League after a few seasons away, Liverpool are in pot three and could face a very tricky draw. The worst case scenario is probably Real Madrid, PSG and Roma. On the other hand, they'd be content with Porto, Basel and APOEL or BATE Borisov. Down and out? Liverpool could face Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain and Roma in their group . VIDEO We'll get better and better - Rodgers . Arsenal . After negotiating their way past Besiktas at the Emirates on Wednesday, Arsenal will be in the top pot. So, similarly to Chelsea, they won't want to get PSG, Galatasaray and Roma. Once again, they wouldn't be too daunted by Basle, CSKA and APOEL. Up for it: Arsenal will be in the top pot of seeds after overcoming Besiktas on Wednesday . What about the Europa League? You'll just have to be patient. The Europa League draw, which will feature Everton and potentially Tottenham and Hull too, takes place on Friday at midday, again at the Grimaldi Forum. You can follow that live here on MailOnline, too.

Benzema put Real Madrid ahead in the first half with his first goal for Real Madrid since a strike against Bayern Munich last April. The club is under pressure to sign another forward to compete with the Frenchman but Ancelotti has said that the squad is now complete and there will be no movement ahead of next Monday’s. Cristiano Ronaldo also had the ball in the net from an offside position after running on to Luca Modric pass. The home side’s first chance came on three minutes when Gareth Bale’s free-kick sailed high over the Cordoba bar. The newly promoted side were playing their first game in top flight for 43 years and had brought 6,000 supporters with them. Ronaldo then claimed a penalty after a push from Jose Angel Crespo in the area but the referee waved away appeals and the visitors immediately had their first chance with Mike Havenaar shooting just past Iker Casillas right-hand post. The Spain captain had been picked to start the game with new signing Keylor Navas left on the bench alongside Xabi Alonso, Asier Illaramendi, Sami Khedira, Isco and Rafael Varane – around 100m euros of surplus talent.

Real Madrid’s next chance came when Daniel Pinillos was booked for tripping Alvaro Arbeloa on the edge of the area. Luka Modric rolled the free-kick to Ronaldo whose drilled shot was saved by Juan Carlos. Cordoba were playing without fear in their first game back in the big-time. They finished seventh in last season’s second division but were promoted because Barça’s B-team, who cannot be promoted, finished third giving their place in the play-offs to Cordoba. Bale forced two corners and from the second the ball came out to Kroos whose shot failed to make it through the crowded area. The German tried again from distance and this time Juan Carlos had to get down smartly to make the save. Finally the deadlock was broken and predictably it came via the right foot of Kroos whose perfectly executed corner was headed home by Benzema. The Frenchman needed a goal having not scored in preseason and with many fans still hoping Falcao is signed before deadline day to replace him in the starting line-up.

Cordoba finished the half strongly with Havenaar heading wide from a corner and their supporters chanted ‘yes we can’ as the two teams went down the tunnel. Madrid encouraged those away fans with a very slow start to the second half. Albert Ferrer’s side were quicker to everything although it was still Madrid who had the first real chance of the second 45 minutes with James Rodriguez going close to his first goal for his new club. Madrid were still struggling to get into their stride and there were some whistles of discontent from supporters. The volume of the discontent went up when Cordoba put the ball in the Madrid net. Casillas palmed a Fidel shot straight out to Xisco who scored, but the former Newcastle striker was flagged offside and Real were off the hook. James Rodriguez was replaced by Isco and one-time Arsenal target Sami Khedira, who now looks set to stay at the club, replaced Benzema as Carlo Ancelotti looked to add another body to midfield and play Bale and Ronaldo as a front two. Ronaldo scored from an offside position running on to Kroos’ pass and then hammered in the second from all of 30-yards out but it was the Cordoba fans making most noise on the final whistle as Madrid fans filed away not convinced by their team’s first home showing of the season.","Real Madrid kick off new La Liga season with victory over Cordoba .

Former middleweight boxing champion Jermain Taylor was arrested on Friday following a shooting at his home in suburban Little Rock, Arkansas, according to a spokesman for the Pulaski County Sheriff's Office. 'Mr. Taylor was arrested for domestic battery, first-degree, and aggravated assault,' said sheriff's Lt. Carl Minden. 'It was his cousin and another individual that came over to his house, an altercation ensued, he (Taylor) grabbed a weapon and opened fire.'

The cousin was hospitalised in a serious condition with an apparent gunshot wound. The other man, described as a friend of the cousin, was not injured, Minden said. The two drove away from the home and were found at a Dollar General discount store several blocks away, Minden said, after a woman believed to be Taylor's wife called 911 shortly before 6pm to report an intruder and a shooting at the home. The names of the cousin and other man were not released. Taylor, 36, was being held in the Pulaski County jail without bond early on Wednesday, according to online prison records.

"By . Damien Gayle for MailOnline . Slippers and gin: Football legend Paul Gascoigne looking frail and weak carrying a bottle of gin and cigarettes in the town centre of Bournemouth . Paul Gascoigne has been kept in hospital four a four-day emergency detox to help him recover from his latest alcoholic breakdown. The former England and Tottenham Hotspur footballer, 47, has been in Poole Hospital since he collapsed outside his home in Sandbanks, Dorset, clutching a bottle of gin. Friends of Gascoigne have said he is desperate for another stint of rehab, but following a string of failed business deals has no cash to check himself in. Gascoigne is set to be discharged from hospital tomorrow. The Sunday Mirror claims relatives and friends will then rally round in an attempt to intervene to get him to change his self-destructive course. He may then travel to the North East, his home region, to stay with his father, John, while he tries to battle his addiction. The Sun on Sunday reports that Gascoigne is desperate to return to the luxury U.S. rehab centre he attended last year after friends including Chris Evans raised £40,000 to fund his treatment. The paper's reporter cites a 'mate' of Gascoigne as saying the fallen midfield magician has been spending hours on end at home drinking heavily and listening to Amy Winehouse's tragically prescient song Rehab on repeat. The Sun On Sunday's report appeared to contradict the Sunday Mirror's, claiming that Gascoigne would be taken straight from hospital to rehab, possibly the Cottonwood Clinic in Arizona that he attended last year. But the paper quoted a friend of the family as saying: 'They don't know where they will get the money. A lot of people won't be daft enough to put their hands in their pockets again.' The Sunday Mirror reports Gascoigne had been left depressed after he was rebuffed by several television channels he had approached in hopes of working as a World Cup pundit. He was also said to be upset at not being offered the chance to appear on any reality TV programmes. 'Over the last few years he's had many offers to appear on reality TV shows but decided against it,' the Sunday Mirror quoted an unnamed source as saying. 'This year when he could do with the money he's not heard anything.' Misery is heaping on to misery for Gascoigne. Yesterday it was reported that he could be homeless in just 10 days after being told he must quit his £3million rented penthouse apartment. A string of 'noise complaints' by neighbours in the luxury apartment block, which overlooks Poole Harbour, is said to have led to the ultimatum. The director of the management company in charge of the flats has dismissed claims he is being forced to leave, but said his landlord was not renewing the rental contract. Christopher Eales, 84, said: 'The only thing I can tell you is that he has not been asked to leave. 'His lease will run out on September 13 and the landlord will not be renewing the contract as he wants the flat back.' A friend however has reportedly said that the ex-footballer has been told to leave before the end date. Months ago, he had to leave another rented apartment in Sandbanks after a series of disturbances. Never meet your heroes: A policeman looks downcast as he escorts Gascoigne, a man he probably idolised as a youth, to a waiting ambulance after his latest alcoholic breakdown came this week . In the midst of his latest health scare, two builders have also described how they pulled the former Newcastle player from a bush following a suspected drinking session. Dan Lawrence, 31, and his brother Ben, 29, helped Gascoigne up after they saw two legs 'sticking out of the bush' and found him rolling around and struggling to get up. The pair told The Sun that the footballer had a brief chat with them before 'stumbling off' towards his flat. Two days later, Gascoigne looked dazed and occasionally broke into sobs, as he was led to an ambulance after being found wandering the streets clutching a four-pack of lager and a bottle of gin. The former World Cup hero’s latest downward spiral ended in hospital near his home in the expensive Sandbanks area of Poole, where he woke up on Thursday afternoon after once more falling spectacularly off the wagon. Prime: Gazza showing off his silky skills against Cameroon at the semi-final of World Cup Italia '90 . In the most shocking chapter yet of his long and often very public battle with alcoholism, onlookers had dialled 999 after finding him slumped tearfully against a wall with his head in his hands at around 2.30pm. Shortly before the ambulance had whisked him away, at 3.05pm, the former England star was seen calling a friend to plead: ‘I’m in trouble, please can you come and help me?’ Gascoigne, who looks far, far older than his 47 years, was believed last night to be in Poole Hospital. He had been observed drinking in public on several occasions in preceding days, and at lunchtime on Tuesday was videoed by a passer-by in what appeared to be an inebriated state, in central Bournemouth. ‘You could smell the booze on him. He was hanging on me to stay up. He was absolutely battered,’ said an onlooker. When he was taken into care 48 hours later, he appeared to still be wearing the same T-shirt.","Former England ace is set to be discharged from hospital tomorrow .

"By . Matt Morlidge for MailOnline . Follow @@MattMorlidge . Relive Sportsmail's for minute-by-minute coverage from La Liga as Barcelona travelled to play Villarreal. Lionel Messi and Neymar featured but the show was stolen by an unlikely hero. Host commentator . They got there eventually... but Barcelona were a little lucky this evening. Mistakes persisted at the back, and Villarreal hit the post three times. Now it's time for Real Madrid! 90mins: Three minutes added... can Barcelona hang on? 86mins: But Villarreal come back into it! New burst of energy for the hosts, but Vietto fires his volley over from inside the box. What a debut! Barcelona finally break the deadlock and it's the teenager who gets it. Messi pokes his cross through the goalkeepers legs and Sandro Ramirez taps the ball in from a yard out. Not his best goal I'm sure, but surely the biggest of his life so far. 77mins: Close again! Messi's deflected effort skims the post after a neat cut back from Dani Alves. Desperate, but strong defending from the hosts today. 75mins: Last throw of the dice for Enrique and he opts to bring on experience in the shape of club captain Xavi. 72mins: Villarreal should be leading. That's right. Pina hits the post from the edge of the box and Giovani's follow up is fired across goal. Surely there's a goal in this one? 71mins: What a time to get your debut as a 19-year-old... 68mins: Barca haven't come closer than that. Messi is played through down the right and his cross finds Neymar in the six yard box. Unfortunately for him, his shot is somehow blocked on the floor by Victor Ruiz, getting anything in the way. Think it came off his back in the end, anything to prevent that first goal. 66mins: Not many players strike a free-kick towards goal from nearly 40 yards. But not many players are Lionel Messi. The forward's effort is dipping towards goal when Asenjo makes an acrobatic save... may have been going wide though. 60mins: Neymar is on and straight away Barca's pace quickens. The Brazilian passes out wide to Rakitic whose dangerous cross is hacked away. Then Neymar's near post flick on from the corner nearly finds Mathieu. Impact. 56mins: I don't think Villarreal can last much longer playing like this. Barca have enjoyed over 70 per cent possession so far, and the hosts aren't even trying to break away right now. They're well and truly camped in their own half. And what makes things worse, Neymar is warming up... 50mins: This time it's Barcelona who are defending nervously! New signing Mathieu has to get something on a dangerous cross but he so nearly diverts it into his own net... Bravo watches the ball onto the post. Away we go again! And while we're at it , here's the Real Madrid team to play Real Sociedad: Casillas, Carvajal, Pepe, Ramos, Marcelo, Kroos, Modric, James, Isco, Bale, Benzema . Goalless at the break then, Barca need to step things up a notch here. Mind you, they do have a certain Brazilian on the bench... 42mins: 'Tasty' atmosphere now. The crowd cheer as Dani Alves is booked after complaining about a high challenge from Jaime Costa. After starting brightly, Barca's pace has dropped and Villarreal are defending and attacking reasonably comfortably. 37mins: Pedro is booked after clearly impeding Giovani as the forward tried to break clear. 34mins: Villarreal still holding firm, and now looking dangerous themselves. When they do get the ball, they are playing it a little quicker than the visitors. 28mins: Barca so nearly net the opener, as Lionel Messi's free-kick troubles Asenjo. Trigueros deflects the goalbound effort further towards the corner, and in truth the stopper does well to divert it onto the post. 23mins: Short set piece from Villarreal and Giovani's cross finds his way to the back post... but how Victor Ruiz somehow misses! The ball bounces up and hits the defenders thigh from six yards out, looping over the bar. What a chance. 19mins: Unsavoury update now. Last year a banana was thrown at Dani Alves at this ground, before the right back promptly through ait back and drew praise throughout the world of football. Today, the Brazilian is being booed by the home fans... 15mins: Close! Finally Barca click into gear. Messi feeds Pedro on the left, whose stinging drive on his weaker foot is well saved by Asengo. The hosts need to be careful not to give the ball away like that in their own half. 11mins: The tempo is set for this one. Barca having all the possession, with the odd counter attack from the hosts. Cheryshev (on loan from Real Madrid) and Giovani will trouble Mathieu and Pique. 6mins: Very nervy defending from Villarreal so far. First a hacked clearance nearly puts Messi in, then the Musacchio has to hack the ball clear after a dangerous cross from Pedro. Looking good here, are Luis Enrique's Barca. 3mins: Barca starting off lively here, with two early shots. Munir's effort from a corner is scuffed wide before Messi hits a similarly week effort straight at Sergio Asenjo in the hosts' goal. We're expecting to see Munir left, Messi central, Pedro on the right. There's also a chance for new signings Claudio Bravo, Jeremy Mathieu and Ivan Rakitic to impress. So, with just ten minutes until kick-off lets look at those teams. Giovani will be the main familiar face for the hosts, the ex-Tottenham and Barca winger, while Neymar is back on the bench for the Catalan giants. Andres Iniesta is out of action with a knee injury.

"By . Wills Robinson for MailOnline . Paul Gascoigne, pictured walking with a bottle of gin in Sandbanks, Dorset, last week, has been told by the landlord he must leave his penthouse apartment . Paul Gascoigne could be homeless in just 10 days after being told he must quit his £3million penthouse apartment. The news comes after shocking images emerged of the former England player - once the country's most gifted midfielder - slumped with his head in hands, outside his home in Sandbanks, Dorset. A string of 'noise complaints' by neighbours in the luxury apartment block, which overlooks Poole Harbour, is said to have led to the ultimatum. The director of the management company in charge of the flats has dismissed claims he is being forced to leave, but said his landlord was not renewing the rental contract.

'His lease will run out on September 13 and the landlord will not be renewing the contract as he wants the flat back.' A friend however has reportedly said that the ex-footballer has been told to leave before the end date. Gascoigne is believed to still be in Poole Hospital after he was taken their by medics 'for his own safety' on Thursday afternoon. Pictures of him being led away by the emergency services released last week show the 47-year-old looking  almost unrecognisable from his playing days. In the midst of his latest health scare, two builders have also described how they pulled the former Newcastle player from a bush following a suspected drinking session. Dan Lawrence, 31, and his brother Ben, 29, helped Gascoigne up after they saw two legs 'sticking out of the bush' and found him rolling around and struggling to get up. The pair told The Sun that the footballer had a brief chat with them before 'stumbling off' towards his flat. Two days later, he was in an ambulance on the way to hospital. He was also recently seen in public at a WH Smith store, where fans said he appeared 'unsteady on his feet'. His sister Lindsay said on Facebook yesterday: ‘This illness is so tragic, and there is no cure, and [it] has shown its ugly head again. So in among my heartbreak . . . please leave us alone to grieve and pull together as a family as always to help save a great man.’ It had been claimed that Gascoigne was set to make his return to football after a journey for cigarettes led him to meet taxi driver and Abbey FC manager Chris Foster - who convinced the former England international to sign for the Hayward Sunday League side. Harry Redknapp, the manager of Queens Park Rangers, has offered trouble Gascoigne the chance to help out with coaching his young players at QPR as he voiced his concern for the former England midfielder's health. A string of 'noise complaints' from neighbours in the luxury apartment in Sandbanks is believed to have led to the ultimatum by his landlord . The former Newcastle and Lazio player was taken to hospital 'for his own safety' after being found drinking on the street outside his home . Since relocating to the south coast, Gascoigne now lives in close proximity to Redknapp, who revealed he would jump at the chance to give him a way back into the game. 'He is a great lad and it is just sad to see how he is looking at the moment,' he said. 'I saw him about a month ago and I said 'I will pick you up in the mornings Gazza, come training with me. Do a little bit of work with the kids.' Gascoigne enjoyed a memorable professional career which saw him represent the likes of Newcastle, Tottenham, Lazio and Rangers, whilst also becoming a firm favourite among many England supporters. The ex-England midfielder has been plauged by alcohol and drug problems and was spotted with his head in his hands following a suspected drinking binge in Sandbanks, Dorset,  last week . The troubled 47-year-old moved to the luxury Dorset resort earlier this year, and has been renting the property which has a view over Poole Harbour . However he has been plagued by alcoholism and drug addiction, last played professional football a decade ago when he made five appearances for then-League Two side Boston United. He was first sent to rehab by Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson in 1998, having been found unconscious after drinking 32 shots of whisky. His life since has been an ongoing struggle with drink, drugs and mental health issues. In a TV documentary shown last September, the star described the pain of fearing he might start drinking again, despite knowing it could kill him. The ITV show Being Paul Gascoigne revealed he was addicted to sweets and spent £1,000 a year on anti-wrinkle jabs to counteract the ravages of drinking. The star of the 1990 World Cup in Italy, whose teams included Newcastle United, Tottenham, Lazio, Rangers, Everton and Middlesbrough, spoke about overhearing doctors say he might die when he was being treated in the US.","Former footballer faces being thrown out of his home in Sandbanks, Dorset .

The shocking recording taken by the girl's parents and released by police shows Vacca standing closely next to the girl when the gun recoiled as she fired on full automatic mode.

He then scaled a cherrypicker that had been parked nearby, and sat in the basket, the Gold Coast Bulletin reported. Christmann could see directly into the bedroom of an 18-year-old woman who had been trying to get to bed when she noticed him performing an indecent act. The woman attempted to hide from Christmann by turning her bedroom lights off, however she told police he then began to use his lighter in a bid to see her better. The 26-year-old scaled a small cherrypicker to look through the second story window of a woman's apartment before performing an indecent act . She then called the police who arrested the wheel repairer shortly afterwards. Christmann was granted bail despite the police prosecutor, Ben Fotheringham, objecting, claiming the woman 'expressed fears to the police that he may return again,' the Gold Coast Bulletin reported. The 26-year-old must report to police three times a week and follow a strict curfew as part of his bail conditions. He will reappear in court on September 29 and could face a jail sentence.

"By . Dan Bloom for MailOnline . A top North Korean banker is on the run in remote eastern Russia with £3million of an alleged government slush fund, it has been reported. Yun Tae Hyong defected to Russia last week and is now seeking asylum in a third country, a source told the South Korean newspaper JoongAng Ilbo. The official was said to have been in the port city of Nakhodka, an outpost just 120 miles from Russia's ten-mile-long border with North Korea. Scroll down for video . Vanished: One of Kim Jong Un's most trusted bankers has defected to Russia, according to reports yesterday . Feared: Led by   Kim Jong Un (pictured), North Korea has thousands of political prisoners and work camps . He reportedly handled money personally for the state's feared autocrat Kim Jong Un. He worked for the Daesong Bank, which is suspected by the U.S. government of being under the control of the North Korean government's Office 39. The Office is widely believed to finance illicit activities, including buying luxury goods for Kim's inner circle despite them being banned under UN sanctions. The bank, which focuses on North Korea's rare exchanges with the outside world, was blacklisted by the U.S. Treasury Department in 2010. It was set up in 1978 to handle payments by North Korean trading firms, according to the South Korean Unification Ministry's website. £15million of North Korean cash which the U.S. accused of being used for illicit activities was frozen in 2005 at the Macau-based Banco Delta Asia. That case stands as practically the only public success in seizing funds from the isolated country. Fleeing: The banker was reportedly in Nakhodka (top right), near Russia's tiny border with North Korea . Photo opportunity: North Korea's state news agency regularly releases images and propaganda for the leader . Inspection: The dictator inspecting biscuits in the November 2 Factory of the Korean People's Army . The newspaper suggested Yun could come to South Korean, adding North Korea had asked Russian authorities for cooperation in efforts to capture him. It was not clear how he travelled to Russia or what he was doing before he defected. South Korea's Unification Ministry said it had no knowledge of the matter. Kim Jong Un is in his early 30s and came to power in December 2011 when his father, Kim Jong Il, died of a heart attack. Experts are divided as to whether Kim has managed to exert full control over a country in which he sits at the centre of a leadership cult devoted to his father and grandfather. Kim's uncle Jang Song Thaek, who was also involved in the operation of Office 39, was purged in December last year along with an unknown number of officials connected to him. Images showed him being paraded before a court before he was led for execution. An expert told Reuters that if Yun has  defected, he may not  have extensive knowledge of the regime because even top officials work in a 'compartmentalised' way. Koh Yu-hwan, a North Korea leadership expert at Dongguk University in Seoul, said: '(Officials) are only able to know about their work and commitments. It is hard to know something big beyond that in North Korea.'","Yun Tae Hyong vanished in Russia according to South Korean newspaper .

"By . Sally Lee . and Louise Cheer for Daily Mail Australia . Prime Minister Tony Abbott has been criticised by indigenous leaders after he repeatedly stated that the arrival of the First Fleet 'was the defining moment in the history of this continent'. Among them include Warren Mundine, chairman of the Prime Minister's Indigenous Advisory Council, told ABC Radio that white settlement was 'a disastrous defining moment for indigenous people'. Mr Abbott made the comments at the opening of a history exhibition at the National Museum in Canberra on Friday, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. Tony Abbott (left) repeatedly stated on Friday that the arrival of the First Fleet was the defining moment in Australian history. But Wareen Mundine (right), a key indigenous adviser, said white settlement was 'a disastrous defining moment for indigenous people' 'It was the moment this continent became part of the modern world. It determined our language, our law and our fundamental values. Yes, it did dispossess and for a long time marginalise Indigenous people,' Mr Abbott said. 'As Noel Pearson frequently reminds us, modern Australia has an important Indigenous and multicultural character. Still it's British settlement that has most profoundly shaped the country that we are.' Matilda House, head of the Stolen Generation Council for NSW, also  disapproved Mr Abbott's comments. 'I can't fathom how a ship or a boat sailed into Sydney Habour can overtake the 60,000 years before,' she told the ABC on Saturday. In July, Mr Abbott landed himself in hot water after he said Australia was unsettled before British colonisation. He made the comments during an address at the Melbourne Institute, saying Australia was unimaginable without foreign investment. 'I guess our country owes its existence to a form of foreign investment by the British government in the then unsettled or, um, scarcely settled, Great South Land,' he said on July 4. The Australian Prime Minister landed himself in hot water nearly two months ago after he said that Australia was 'unsettled' before the British arrived . But Australia's first female Aboriginal federal parliamentarian Senator Nova Peris said the comments hindered efforts to have her people recognised in the constitution. The comments were hurtful, dismissive of indigenous Australians and incorrect, she said. In a statement to the ABC, Ms Peris said: 'British settlement was not a foreign investment. It was invasion.' 'The comments from the Prime Minister have not just offended Aboriginal Australians but many people around the country.' Opposition Leader Bill Shorten has also hit out at the prime minister for his previous comments. He said Mr Abbott's remark was offensive, especially from a prime minister who claimed to be dedicated to indigenous affairs. Mr Mundine labelled the comments silly and bizarre.

"By . Anucyia Victor for MailOnline . The landscape is eerily similar to Hoth, the fictional sixth planet featured in Star Wars. And the camera angles make it seem as though there’s a Star Wars film on screen. But it’s the Royal Danish Air Force’s F-16 on a low-level flight as it takes to the skies on a jaunt across the beautiful but desolate Greenland landscape. The flight across the Greenland ice sheet goes along the ice rim east of Kangerlussuaq to the DYE-2 radar station, over the inspection ship Knud Rasmussen, and over the town of Ilussisat where the polar explorer Knud Rasmussen was born. The pilot signs off with a sharp salute before he begins his ascent towards the skies. The jet careens slowly and the aircraft slowly gathers speed, juddering as it races towards the end of the runway. The ground and surrounding landscapes recede into the distance as the jet takes off and meets the crystal clear blue skies. The pilot steers it to a 45 degree angle and the view from the cockpit changes, as the heavens above run parallel to the ground below. The Royal Danish Air Force's  F16 jet flies over Greenland's stunning landscape . Flying friends: Three other jets accompany the pilot as he speeds off into the skies . There is another sharp, steep turn as the pilot shows off his skills. The turquoise waters of a lake reflect the hues of the clear and sunny day. The sun, a bright orb, gleams, its rays piercing through the heavy-duty cockpit shield. The scenery is breath-taking as cliffs rise out of the water. The pilot races ahead to catch up with another plane on the right but holds back at the last minute. Soon there are three jets ahead, accompanying the aircraft on its journey across the pristine Greenland landscape. The camera angle switches to reveal the pilot, his face covered in an oxygen mask and helmet as he nonchalantly slices the jet through the clear air. He looks behind, as if to say goodbye to the land before heading higher up towards the sky. The bright rays of the sun pierce through the sharp, blue skies as the Greenland ice sheets sparkles below . Snow covered hills on the left and a tiny speck  of another jet against green hills on the right . What a view: Glacial blue waters and white ice . Clouds engulf the plane, obscuring the view until once again the F-16 climbs, leaving its cloudy prison and the scenery is visible once more. An icy expanse awaits below, with icebergs poking out through the water. Shards of ice twinkle in the sunlight, ethereal against the dark waters. The pilot waves at  inspection ship Knud Rasmussen below and zooms past, heading towards land. A speck in the sky turns out to be another jet. The F16 picks up speed and the ground whizzes past, showing craggy ice blocks with breaks in between, where icy blue waters peek out and winding around the landscape. The barren ground below looks cold and uninviting but the views are spectacular. Melted ice form pools on the ground before the scene shifts to a pristine, snowy landscape as the plane rockets by, heading towards lush green hills. In a matter of minutes, the plane lands smoothly on the runway and comes to a halt.","F16 jet zooms along the starkly beautiful landscape of pristine snow .

"By . Belinda Robinson . Guilty: Tracey Lynn Garner has been found guilty of murder August 29, after killing an Alabama woman by giving her silicone injections as a buttocks enhancement . A Mississippi woman was convicted yesterday of murder in connection to illicit silicone buttocks injections that led to a Georgia woman's death. Tracy Lynn Garner, 54, was found guilty of depraved-heart murder and conspiracy to commit wire fraud in the 2012 death of Karima Gordon, 37, after a jury deliberated for five hours, according to the state attorney general's office. The murder conviction carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. 'We felt confident that the evidence would lead to a conviction,' Attorney General Jim Hood said. 'We hope this verdict will deliver some sense of justice for Ms. Gordon's family.' Judge Winston Kidd set sentencing for Tuesday. Garner was immediately taken into custody after the verdict was read. Her attorney, John M. Collette said he could not comment on the case because a gag order remained in effect. Gordon, an Atlanta-area resident, died eight days after receiving the injections in 2012. Prosecutors said Gordon's death was caused by injections that Garner administered. They said Gordon was referred to Garner by Natasha Stewart, an adult entertainer also known as Pebbelz Da Model. Stewart was convicted of manslaughter in February and is serving a seven-year prison sentence. The prosecution said Stewart told Gordon that Garner was a nurse. During the trial, Colette suggested that Gordon wanted exactly what Garner had to offer. 'She wanted this underground, bargain basement butt enhancement,' Colette said. He . also stated that Gordon had other injections that could have caused her . death, and argued that the silicone found in Gordon's body didn't match . silicone seized from Garner's Jackson home. 'We don't know how much she'd gotten before she ever came to Mississippi,' Colette said. 'What silicone caused her death?'

"By . Rebecca Brett for MailOnline . A proposal to charge tourists an entrance fee on arrival to Venice has provoked an outcry in the city which relies on tourism for its survival. The proposition comes to deter the growing number of people who just go for day trips in order to avoid the cost of a hotel room or restaurant. Ilaria Borletti, the country's undersecretary of culture, has said that tourists should pay for the privilege of going to the Unesco Word Heritage site. Venice canals: Tourists are thought to be placing a huge strain on the city's fragile infrastructure . She said the fee should be paid by all tourists unless they spend the night in Venice, but visitors under 25 would be exempt. The fee would include free entry to one of the city's museums. On Twitter,  Borletti says: 'Venice does not to have to adapt to tourism, it's tourism that must be adapted to Venice. 'Venice is dying of tourism. The entry ticket, except for overnight stays and under 25's, includes entrance to a museum and proceeds for restoration.' A congested back street on the approach to St Mark's Square . Venice sees around 25 million visitors a year, with the daily total reaching almost 150,000 in the peak season. Over 75 per cent of visitors are day trippers who head for St Mark's Square, drift around the romantic canals and block the tiny alleyways, placing a huge strain on the medieval city's fragile infrastructure. Ms Borletti is the former president of the Italian environment group FAI, a nationwide, non-profit foundation established to safeguard Italy's artistic and natural heritage. Venice sees around 25 million visitors a year, with the daily total reaching almost 150,000 in the peak season. She said the funds raised could be used to finance the city's conservation. 'Venice is slowly dying of tourism, suffocated by summer tourists who eat and run, leaving little or nothing to the city,' Ms Borletti told The Telegraph. 'For this reason I think we have to protect this city. We should think seriously about the introduction of an entry ticket.' Large cruise ships have been banned from Venice after fears they were destructing the fragile floating city . It is estimated that tourism to Venice is worth 11billion euros (£9billion) a year, but of all the tourists who visit the city annually, only a quarter stay in a hotel. Claudio Scarpa, general manager of the Venetian Hotels Association, backed the idea, saying day trippers are a financial burden on the city. 'It is right to find a way to make them pay a kind of entry fee' he says. The news comes just days after Italy banned large cruise ships from going to Venice amid fears they were destructing the fragile floating city.","The fee will be paid by all tourists unless they spend the night in Venice .

"By . Nick Constable for The Mail on Sunday . Kadian Harding, pictured, died after the brakes failed on his bicycle just hours after he had sent it in for a service to a shop in Marlborough, Wiltshire . It was a tragedy that is every parent’s nightmare. As Thomas Harding looked on in helpless horror, his 14-year-old son’s bicycle careered out of control and into the path of a van, killing him instantly. Witnesses described how the boy, Kadian, pumped desperately at his brakes as he hurtled down a steep hill toward the busy road, but to no avail. Now grief-stricken Thomas and his wife Debora have launched a £300,000 High Court action against a bike shop that serviced the brakes on Kadian’s cycle just hours before the fatal accident, claiming negligence. The accident is a moment that will haunt Thomas for ever. ‘I am reliving what happened every day, every moment,’ he said. Thomas, Kadian and four others had been enjoying a bike ride through the Wiltshire Downs on a beautiful July day when tragedy struck. After the inquest, Thomas explained: ‘The path narrowed and became overgrown. We slowed down. My head was down, avoiding rocks and roots. But when I looked up, Kadian was suddenly way ahead, the gradient had become steeper, the track rockier, and then, incredibly, I saw him struck by something moving left to right. One moment he was here, then he was gone.’ The accident happened just 30ft in front of him. ‘I dropped my bike and ran on to the road,’ he recalled. ‘Kadian was lying on the road. He looked like a young boy again. He wasn’t moving. And then I was howling. Crouched a few yards away, hands over my face. Wailing.’ A coroner later ruled that there had been a ‘complete catastrophic failure’ of the front brake, and only partial functioning of the rear. But inquest rules prevented him attributing blame. The family are now suing Acceler8, the Marlborough bike shop that examined Kadian’s brakes just hours before the crash. Philip Birkett, owner of Acceler8, accepts that Kadian had come into the shop and asked him to look at the gears and the rear brakes. Giving evidence to last year’s inquest, he said: ‘I stand by my work and everything I did was correct. When that bike left the shop it was in a perfectly safe condition.’ Debora Harding, pictured,  described her son Kadian as 'a teenager on the brink of manhood' He conceded he did not hold any qualifications for repairing bikes but said he ‘never felt the need to do so – I feel comfortable with my abilities’. Mr Birkett adjusted the gears, replaced a worn rear brake cable and reset the rear brakes. Kadian, of Steep, near Petersfield, Hampshire, had spent his savings on the ‘long haul trucker’ touring bicycle, which he had assembled himself. Thomas, a writer and an experienced cyclist, had taken the bike for a ride two days before his son’s death. He felt the brakes were ‘functioning’ but not ‘optimal’ – and told his son to get them checked out. He said at the inquest: ‘I specifically said, “We are really concerned about the brakes. You must get the front and back brakes looked at.’ Kadian told his father that Acceler8 looked over all the brakes and replaced a cable. ‘I didn’t have a go but I did try both front and back brakes,’ Thomas told the inquest. ‘I noticed they were much firmer now.’ That same afternoon – July 25, 2012 – the party went for the fateful ride. Describing the moments before the crash, Mr Harding told Wiltshire coroner David Ridley: ‘We weren’t going that fast. We were cycling in tandem, then he was suddenly ahead of me. ‘It made no sense that Kadian wouldn’t stop because you could see the road and there was plenty of time to stop.’ A witness, Richard Knowles, who lives nearby, said he heard the schoolboy screaming and saw him pumping his brakes. ‘He was standing up on the pedals,’ said Mr Knowles. ‘He was applying so much force to his brakes that he was trying to keep the bike stable. ‘I think I said to him words to the effect of “Come off.” He made no attempt to steer off the path. He made no attempt to come off the pedals and put his feet on the floor.’ Thomas has given an insight into the pain the accident has caused to his family in a newly published book, Kadian Journal, which gives an emotional and honest account of the accident, its aftermath and memories of his son’s life. ‘You could say that Kadian had been born from a bike,’ Thomas has said. He and Debora met in 1987 as they took part in an American coast- to-coast ride with about 30 students. Debora was not on the ride which claimed her son’s life, as she was in Washington DC, where she was chief executive of a bicycle company. In the book, Thomas writes movingly of the moment that they removed the stabilisers from a four-year-old Kadian’s turquoise cycle as he sat with plastic knee-guards over his corduroy trousers. Tom Harding, right, said he asked his son Kadian, second left, to get the brakes on his bike checked professionally, pictured with his mother Debora, left and 12-year-old sister Sam, front right . ‘As he wobbled and gathered speed to complete a childhood rite of passage, he cried in delight, “I’m doing it. I’m doing it.” ’ The book is just one of the ways the Hardings are keeping Kadian’s memory alive. They have set up a website in his honour and are working with cycle charity Sustrans to promote safer cycling routes. As well the lawsuit – brought under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 via their solicitors, Leigh Day – the Hardings have been campaigning for new legislation that mechanics should be qualified before they can be employed in bike shops. They raised the issue at the inquest, but the coroner dismissed it, saying he did not believe the Government should create more red tape for small businesses. A ‘To let’ sign currently hangs over the Acceler8 store in Marlborough, with neighbouring traders saying it closed for business a month ago. Both parents – who also have a daughter, Sam, two years younger than Kadian – have paid moving tributes to their son in newspaper articles. Debora has written: ‘Those who knew him say he had an extraordinary mix of social skills and intelligence for his age... He was a young teenager on the brink of manhood and had all the promise of being an amazing contributor to the world.’ And Thomas has said: ‘The day after Kadian died, my wife and I woke up in a terror. Is it true? Is he gone? How can it be possible? That our generous, kind, smart, quirky, assured, beautiful boy could be gone. ‘The pain was massive, unbearable. How were we supposed to live in this world?’ Now he and his wife can only wait for a judge to decide whether negligence cruelly tore their son away.","Kadian Harding careered out of control when the brakes on his bike failed .

"By . Carol Driver for MailOnline . Two HIV-positive passengers are suing an airline after they were barred from boarding one of its planes. The two men and a friend are demanding £5,000 and an apology from Chinese Spring Airline after they refused entry to a flight from Shenyang to Shijiazhuang. The two passengers, along with the travelling companion who does not have HIV, were told their tickets had been cancelled after informing staff of their status. First case of its kind: Three people are suing China's Spring Airlines for discrimation . However, the three people have now issued a claim against the airline, accusing it of discrimination. A Shenyang court accepted the case, making it the first lawsuit against an airline for discriminating against an HIV-positive person in China, the Global Times said. ‘The court's acceptance of this case signalled that HIV carriers can protect their rights through legal channels,’ it quoted plaintiff Cheng Shuaishuai as saying. On its website, Spring Airlines states that it has the right to refuse passage to those with ‘infectious diseases’. According the Fazhi Evening Paper, the three passengers were preparing to board a flight on 28 July when they were stopped by airline officials. One passenger told the paper: ‘After we got our boarding passes, we informed a Spring Airlines official that some of us had HIV. ‘The official immediately rang up the Shanghai head office for instructions, and then told us the company has rules forbidding the transportation of passengers with HIV.’ The passenger said their tickets were cancelled and they were forced to take a train to their destination. China only lifted a long-standing ban on HIV-positive foreigners entering the country in 2010. Under Chinese law, airlines can refuse to allow anyone with an ‘infectious’ condition to board their planes. However, according to the BBC, Liu Wei, the plaintiffs' lawyer, said the airline had no evidence the three passengers’ presence would infect anyone else.

"By . Marielle Simon for Daily Mail Australia . The Victorian Government is facing scrutiny for appointing Dr Sonia Sharp as a senior state education official, who has been linked to a shocking child abuse scandal in northern England for a 16-year period . The Victorian Government is facing scrutiny for appointing a senior state education official who has been linked to a shocking child abuse scandal in northern England for a 16-year period. Between 1997 and 2013, children as young as 11 were sexually exploited by gangs of men – most of them of Pakistani origin. At least 1,400 girls were left to be abused by Asian men because the authorities were too scared to admit there was a race issue. Police and council officials in Rotherham suppressed evidence of the crimes because they feared being labelled racist. Now, questions are being raised as to why the Victorian Government would recruit the former director of children's services in Rotherham between 2005 and 2006, Dr Sonia Sharp, as their deputy secretary of Victoria's Education Department. 'I think it absolutely raises questions about the recruitment policies, it raises questions about ongoing arrangements at the highest levels in the education department under the Liberal Government,' said Opposition Leader Daniel Andrews. 'This is not some junior bureaucrat, this is a senior, perhaps almost the most senior person... that is charged with the welfare and protection, the nourishment, the advancement, the education of our kids, there's answers that need to be provided to this and the Premier and the Minister are the ones to provide them.' However, Dr Sharp's peers stand by their decision and hail her as an 'outstanding leader' who has helped strengthen Victoria's system. 'I think that's a matter for ministers, but my point here is that I'm informed that the recruitment process has operated in the normal way, the recruitment process was a straight-forward, normal recruitment process,' Victorian Health Minister David Davis said. A report has discovered that 1,400 children were sexually exploited in Rotherham over a 16-year period. Adil Hussain (left) and Razwan Razaq (right) were jailed in 2010 for grooming young girls in the town . Umar Razaq was another of the five-strong sex gang jailed and placed on the sex offenders' register . Zafran Ramzan, 21, (left) was jailed for nine years and Mohsin Khan (right) for four in the same case . The devastating report by Professor Alexis Jay revealed that: . John . Cameron of the NSPCC said there had been a collective blindness over . the abuse which allowed devastating child sexual exploitation to go . unchallenged. The . charity said; ‘This report is truly damning. Many of these children . were already extremely vulnerable, and the manner in which they were let . down by agencies entrusted to protect them is appalling. ‘It . is hard to imagine the damage caused to victims who were preyed upon . with almost impunity over many years, because of a reluctance to . comprehend or address what was widely happening.’ It . called for authorities to ensure that such failings should never be . repeated and that ‘cultural sensitivities should never stand in the way . of protecting children’. Adam Pemberton of Victim Support said: ‘The extent of the sexual exploitation of young girls is horrific. ‘Almost . as shocking as the details of that abuse is the abject failure on the . part of social services to protect these children. Vulnerable girls were . often not believed by the authorities because of their troubled . backgrounds. The report comes after two others done between 2002 and 2006 which 'could not have been clearer' The report comes after two others done between 2002 and 2006 which 'could not have been clearer' Although partially taking responsibility for the damage that was caused to the victims in Rotherham, Dr Sharp insists she did what she could at the time. 'As soon as I commenced in April 2005 as Rotherham's first director of children's services, I was briefed by politicians, senior managers and frontline staff about the issue of sexual exploitation of young people,' Dr Sharp said in a statement. 'We knew that there were many children in the community at risk and feared this was the tip of an iceberg. 'There was a lot to do: shifting attitudes, raising the quality of services for these vulnerable children, improving early identification and strategies for prevention and, importantly, getting agencies to work together to achieve convictions. 'You can't be the director of children's services and not take responsibility for what happens to children,' she said. 'I regret every case of exploitation of vulnerable girls that was not prevented, but feel strongly that our collective efforts led to gradual but essential improvements in the situation for many young people.' Opposition Leader Daniel Andrews, questions why the Victorian Government would recruit the former director of children's services in Rotherham . Her leadership during that time was commended by Richard Bolt, the department secretary of The Victorian Education Department. 'I have no doubt that Sonia tackled the issue of child sexual exploitation in Rotherham with maximum commitment, professionalism and focus,' Mr Bolt said in a statement. 'In the report there are numerous references to important changes made under Sonia's management that led to sustained and systemic improvement. 'There is considerable evidence not included in the report which reinforces my view.' And Mr Bolt is not the only one from The Department to praise Dr Sharp's work with the Victorian Education Department. A spokesperson for the National Centre Against Bullying said, 'Sonia Sharp is a representative of the Victorian Education Department on the National Centre Against Bullying. 'Sonia is known internationally for her work on tackling bullying in schools and was invited to share this knowledge with the National Centre Against Bullying.' Victorian Health Minister David Davis, (right) and The Victorian Department stand by their decision and hail her as an 'outstanding leader' who has helped strengthen Victoria's system . But despite the approval given by Dr Sonia's peers, Jane . Collins, Ukip’s Yorkshire and Humber MEP, said, ‘I categorically call . for the resignation of everyone directly and indirectly involved in this . case. 'The Labour Council stand accused of deliberately ignoring child . sex abuse victims for 16 years. The apologies we have heard are totally . insincere and go nowhere near repairing the damage done. ‘I . also call for a criminal investigation by a force not directly linked . with this scandal in to all those implicated in this scandal. There is . no place for these people in public life.’ And . at least six victims have now launched a class action against Rotherham . council and could be in line for millions of pounds in compensation. Professor Alexis Jay, author of the report, blasted the 'blatant' failing of Rotherham Council .

Kirsty Henderson and Kevin Wood were the first to find one of the 30 gold bars hidden on a beach in Kent . Hundreds of treasure hunters have descended on Outer Harbour beach, in Folkestone, to hunt for the gold . The artist hid the gold as part of Folkestone Triennial - an art project which takes place every three years. A total of £10,000 has been hidden, comprised of 10g (0.35oz) bars worth £250 and 20g (0.7oz) bars worth £500. The successful couple and Kirsty's sister, Megan, travelled to the beach from Canterbury after hearing about the gold rush on Twitter. Describing the moment he got lucky, Mr Wood, 28, said: 'My legs went from under me and I started shaking. 'I put it quietly in my pocket. We left the beach and half way home, we pulled over for a drink.' Mr Wood and Kirsty plan to spend the money on a romantic weekend in Paris.

"By . Associated Press . and Zoe Szathmary for MailOnline . The New York Police Department said Friday it's under investigation for a second restraint-related death, this one involving a drugged, emotionally disturbed man -- four days before the fatal videotaped chokehold of Eric Garner that fueled community outcry and led the department to overhaul its use-of-force training. The medical examiner's office cited 'physical restrain by police' as a factor in the July 13 death of Ronald Singleton, who went into cardiac arrest in an ambulance and died on the way to a hospital. It ruled his death a homicide. Scroll down for video . Victim: The medical examiner's office cited 'physical restrain by police' as a factor in the July 13 death of Ronald Singleton, pictured . The police department is cooperating with the Manhattan district attorney's office, which is leading the investigation into Singleton's death, a police spokesman told the Associated Press. The district attorney's office did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment from the Associated Press. Police said Singleton became irate and combative while riding in a taxi cab around midnight and fought with an officer on foot patrol after exiting near St. Patrick's Cathedral. Emergency services officers, called in by the patrolling officer, restrained Singleton and placed him in a protective body wrap, police said. The medical examiner's office said the 45-year-old Singleton was in a state of 'excited delirium' related to severe intoxication from the hallucinogenic drug called PCP or angel dust. It cited heart disease exacerbated by high blood pressure and thickened arteries, as well as obesity, as contributing factors in his death. Singleton was to undergo a psychiatric evaluation at a hospital under the police department's protocol for emotionally disturbed people, police said, but the ambulance rerouted to a closer hospital when he went into cardiac arrest. He was pronounced dead on arrival. Wife Lynn Warren Singleton told The New York Daily News he 'was never good with police. He always went into hysterics — this is before he even started indulging.' She also told the newspaper '[The police] didn’t pay attention to him when he was crying for help. Someone having a heart attack is different signs than someone just bugging out.' Speaking to The New York Post, she said 'I was thinking this was very similar to Garner.' Police did not immediately respond to questions Friday about the status of the officers involved in Singleton's restraint. A spokesman for the city's largest police union, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, did not immediately respond to a message from the Associated Press . Singleton's death drew little attention at the time. But Friday's homicide ruling thrust it into the category of police-related deaths under scrutiny after the July 17 chokehold death of Eric Garner in Staten Island and the Aug. 9 fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Probe: The New York Police Department said Friday it's under investigation for the restraint-related death . Garner, a 43-year-old father of six who had asthma, could be heard on an amateur video shouting 'I can't breathe!' as an officer placed him in a chokehold during an arrest on suspicion of selling untaxed cigarettes. The officer was stripped of his gun and badge after Garner's death. The Staten Island district attorney is assembling a special grand jury next month to hear evidence in the case. Police in Ferguson have said the 18-year-old Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street and one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car and physically assaulted him. But several witnesses have said Brown was shot when his hands were up. Brown's shooting by the officer has spurred unrest in his community, and federal authorities are investigating.","The medical examiner's office cited 'physical restrain by police' as a factor in the July 13 death of Ronald Singleton, who went into cardiac arrest in an ambulance and died on the way to a hospital .

"By . Jason Groves for the Daily Mail . Top job: Helle Thorning-Schmidt is backed by Cameron in bid to be the next President of Europe . David Cameron is willing to back Neil Kinnock’s daughter-in-law in her bid to become the next President of Europe at crunch talks in Brussels today. Government sources last night said Danish prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt is one of a handful of leaders he thinks he could work with as he tries to renegotiate Britain’s membership of the European Union. She is best known here for posing for a flirtatious selfie photograph with Mr Cameron and Barack Obama at Nelson Mandela’s funeral earlier this year. She leads Denmark’s social democrats and is married to Lord Kinnock’s son Stephen. A Government source said the 47-year-old had forged a ‘very strong relationship’ with Mr Cameron and could ‘work with us on the reforms we seek in Europe’. The Prime Minister is also expected to hold talks today with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker about securing a senior post for his controversial candidate Lord Hill of Oareford. Britain is demanding a major economic portfolio in the new European Commission, despite Lord Hill’s low profile. But Mr Juncker has warned Mr Cameron and other EU leaders that he plans to give most of the best jobs to women in order to improve the Commission’s gender balance. EU leaders will gather in Brussels to decide who will replace Herman van Rompuy as President of the European Council. A replacement for the EU’s foreign affairs chief baroness Ashton is also likely to be decided. None of the candidates for the presidency have publicly declared their hand, not least because most are already holding public office. But the leading candidates are understood to be Miss Thorning-Schmidt, the Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, the Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite and the former Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis, who is emerging as a possible compromise candidate. Government sources last night said Mr Cameron could work with all the leading candidates for the job, despite having clashed with Mr Tusk over Britain’s demands for curbs to the free movement of workers in Europe. Thorning-Schmidt is best known for taking a selfie with Cameron and Obama at Nelson Mandela's funeral . Pawel Swidlicki, of the think tank Open Europe, said the choice of European president was critical to Mr Cameron’s hopes of securing major reforms ahead of an In/Out referendum planned for 2017. He said: ‘The European Council President will play a crucial role in brokering David Cameron’s potential EU re-negotiation. Therefore, London should invest most of its political capital securing an honest broker for Council president and a leading job in the next European Commission for Lord Hill - such as the internal market or competition portfolios.’ Diplomatic sources said Italian foreign minister Federica Mogherini is emerging as the favourite to replace Baroness Ashton, despite criticism that she is ‘too soft’ on Russia. Mr Cameron appears to have abandoned hopes of blocking her appointment, but officials insisted her personal views were of little importance as it is EU leaders who dictate foreign policy.

"By . Lucy Osborne for the Daily Mail . Civil servants are spending hours each week editing Wikipedia pages on trivial subjects – including Sir Elton John and Jurassic Park. Comedian Roy ‘Chubby’ Brown, Scottish football clubs and Nazi paratroopers are among hundreds of other entries on the online encyclopedia that have been edited from Whitehall computers. Since January, more than 600 Wikipedia edits – more than two every working day – can be traced back to Government computers. Scroll down for video . Civil servants changed the Wikipedia page for Roy 'Chubby' Brown (pictured) from a Government computer to add details of his recent court case where he was convicted of driving without due care and attention . These have previously been identified as the source of controversial changes of sensitive entries, including the Hillsborough disaster and, earlier this month, the spare room subsidy, described by critics as the ‘bedroom tax’. A 24-year-old civil servant was fired in June after he edited the phrase ‘You’ll never walk alone’, the anthem of Liverpool FC, to read: ‘You’ll never walk again’ on the Hillsborough section of the site in 2012. Now an investigation by the Daily Mail has discovered that Whitehall computers have also been responsible for thousands of tweaks to more trivial topics in recent years. It will raise questions over how civil servants are able to get away with wasting so much time on an irrelevant activity. Almost anyone can edit pages on Wikipedia, which is the sixth most popular website on the internet, with nearly 500million unique visitors a month. One user tweaked the Jurrasic Park Wikipedia page stating 'I don't think Jurassic Park conforms to the genre' Users can see details of any changes along with the IP address or user name of the person responsible. IP addresses are assigned to computers and identify the network they use to access the internet, which allows any editing to be traced, in this case to Whitehall. In the past two days alone, the names of band members in Hatful Of Rain were added, an Elton John page had a song title corrected and a list of Horrible History episodes was updated. Changes were also made to the page about Roy ‘Chubby’ Brown and Jurassic Park. Pages on Shirley Valentine, curry, the SAS and presenter Des Lynam were also altered. In the past month there have also been at least 15 changes to webpages for Scottish football clubs. In the past two days alone an Elton John (pictured) page had the spelling for song title Hercules corrected .

"By . Associated Press . NASCAR superstar Tony Stewart's voice trembled today as he said the death of Kevin Ward Jr. will 'affect my life forever' as he returned to the track for the first time since his car struck and killed the fellow driver during a sprint-car race in New York three weeks ago. 'I've taken the last couple of weeks off out of respect for Kevin and his family and also to cope with the accident in my own way,' Stewart said. 'It's given me the time to think about life and how easy it is to take it for granted. I miss my team, my teammates and I miss being back in the race car and I think being back in the car this week with my racing family will help me get through this difficult time.' Scroll down for video . NASCAR auto racing driver Tony Stewart reads a statement during a news conference at Atlanta Motor Speedway in Hampton, Georgia on Friday. Stewart says the death of Kevin Ward Jr. will 'affect my life forever' as he returned to the track for the first time . Stewart said he could not answer questions about the incident — it remains under police investigation — and he left the news conference after reading a short statement. Stewart-Haas Racing executive vice president Brett Frood said it was '100 percent' Stewart's decision to race and that his 43-year-old driver was 'emotional' but ready to go on Sunday night in Atlanta. The three-time NASCAR champion has not raced since his car hit Ward at an August 9 sprint car event in upstate New York. Stewart pulled out of the race at Watkins Glen the next morning, then skipped races at Michigan and Bristol Motor Speedway. Stewart, who was described by police as 'visibly shaken' the night of Ward's death, has been in seclusion ever since. Stewart's only comment since the crash was a statement the day after the crash in which he said 'there aren't words to describe the sadness I feel about the accident that took the life of Kevin Ward Jr.' It has been Stewart's decision to return to the track, racing execs said, and that the 43-year-old driver was 'emotional' but ready to go on Sunday night in Atlanta . 'Tony has sent the family flowers and a card around the services, aside from that, he has been very respectful of their time to grieve,' Frood said. 'It is very important to Tony to spend time with the family ... but is being respectful.' Ward had climbed from his car after it had spun while racing for position with Stewart. The 20-year-old walked down onto the racing surface waving his arms in an apparent attempt to confront Stewart. Authorities said the first car to pass Ward had to swerve to miss hitting him. The front of Stewart's car then appeared to clear Ward, but Ward was struck by the right rear tire and hurtled through the air. He died of blunt force trauma. Ontario County Sheriff Philip Povero has said investigators did not have any evidence to support criminal intent by Stewart. Povero said Thursday the investigation is still ongoing. Meanwhile, the NASCAR superstar will move forward with his career and attempt to salvage his season. NASCAR driver Kevin Ward Jr on the track before Tony Stewart ran him over three weeks ago during a race in New York . Medical workers try to revive the NASCAR driver but he died after he was thrown through the air after being clipped by Stewart's car . NASCAR released a statement saying that Stewart was eligible to return because he 'has received all necessary clearances required to return to all racing activities.' NASCAR said it would have no further comment until President Mike Helton speaks Friday afternoon. Stewart, who has 48 career Cup wins in 542 starts, is one of the biggest stars in the garage. His peers have been protective of him as questions emerged in the aftermath of the crash, and it pained them that Stewart was grieving in private and had cut off communication with so many of them. 'Great to have Smoke back at the track,' tweeted Watkins Glen winner AJ Allmendinger. 'Glad to have my boss and my friend back at the track this weekend. #14 #SmokeWillRise,' said Tony Gibson, Danica Patrick's crew chief at SHR. NASCAR rules state a driver must attempt to either qualify or race the car in every points-paying event to be eligible for Chase for the Sprint Cup championship, unless a waiver is granted. There was no immediate word if NASCAR would grant that waiver. Since Ward's death, NASCAR has announced a rule that prohibits drivers from exiting from a crashed or disabled vehicle — unless it is on fire — until safety personnel arrive. Last week, Denny Hamlin crashed while leading at Bristol and stayed in his car until safety personnel arrived. But Hamlin then exited his vehicle and angrily tossed a safety device at Kevin Harvick as he passed by moments later. He was not penalized.

"By . David Martosko, Us Political Editor for MailOnline . Two years after losing the presidency to Barack Obama, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney is positioned to crush all comers in a crowded field of Republican 2016 hopefuls, according to a poll of Iowa voters released Wednesday. His stunning performance in the early caucus state came just one day after he told a radio interviewer that while he doesn't plan to run for the White House again... but 'circumstances can change', he said. 'I love the country enough to know that I'm not as good a candidate this time around as I think the other guys would be,' Romney told radio host Hugh Hewitt on Tuesday,  'because they're new and not defined. I want the country to win. I do not want to see Hillary Clinton as our next president. So I stepped aside so someone who has a better shot will be able to step forward.' In a USA Today/Suffolk University poll, 35 per cent of Iowa Republicans said they would support Romney if their state's nominating process kicked off today. No one else in the field of 14 potential presidential candidates had a double-digit showing. Together again: Former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney (right) appeared at the Union League of Chicago on August 21 with his former running mate U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan (left) for a book promotion appearance . Still hungry for Mitt: Romney has fans in every state, including some independent voters who have buyer's remorse after supporting President Obama in 2012 . Former Arkansas governor and Fox News Channel host Mike Huckabee came in a distant second with just under 9 per cent.  New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie had 6.5 per cent support, followed by perennial conservative candidate and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum with 5.9 per cent. Without Romney in the mix, the poll numbers still showed Huckabee and Christie atop the leader board with 13.1 per cent and 10.7 per cent support, respectively. Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who faces a politically charged abuse of power indictment in his home state, would run third in a Romney-free field with 8.8 per cent. Inserting Romney into the hypothetical race would shift more votes from moderate candidates, leaving conservative stalwarts' numbers relatively untouched. Romney has said repeatedly the he's leaning against running again, but he told Hewitt that he would enjoy a second ride on the campaign roller coaster. 'I know this is hard for a lot of people to recognize,' he said, 'but frankly, I'd love to run for president. I loved running for president.' But 'someone else has a better chance than I do,' he cautioned. 'And that's what we believe, and that's why I'm not running.' 'And you know, circumstances can change,' he said. 'Well, you know, let's say all the guys that were running all came together and said, ""Hey, we've decided we can't do it. You must do it."" That's the one-of-a-million we're thinking about.' For now, Romney is busy talking up the bona fides of those other Republican maybe-candidates. 'There are people who are not yet known by the American public who have extraordinary records, great capability,' he said, 'Paul Ryan being one of them, Scott Walker, Bobby Jindal, Marco Rubio.' 'Of course, people are getting to know Chris Christie,' he added. 'Jeb Bush – they don't know Jeb Bush as the governor of Florida, and the kind of record he has and had there.' 'These are people who I think have the potential to really ignite interest in our party and potentially win the general [election].' Company man: Romney has been stumping for fellow Republicans including Rep. Tom Cotton (left), who is running for the US Senate in Arkansas. He has also campaigned with Chris Christie in New Hampshire . Romney-watchers have seen other indications that the GOP base is warming to the possibility of a do-over for the 2012 runner-up. In June a Suffolk University/Boston Herald poll of likely New Hampshire Republican voters, 24 per cent picked Romney as their dog in the race. As with the Iowa survey, no one else in the field cracks into double digits. Christie was the second-place finisher in that poll, with 9 per cent. New Hampshire and Iowa are two of the three most important early bellwether states in the presidential nominating process, the third being South Carolina. Presidential exploratory committee watch those states closely to gauge their chances, since victories in the first handful of states can translate into fundraising windfalls and priceless media spotlights.","Former Massachusetts Gov. Romney snared 35 per cent of Iowa Republicans' support in a new poll released Wednesday .

"By . Alex Peake-tomkinson For The Mail On Sunday . Priory House is so large that when I ask its owner, film and television composer Laurie Johnson, how many bedrooms there are, he confesses he doesn’t know. ‘Seven, I think,’ he ventures, which turns out to be correct. Not only is the house, in the North London suburb of Stanmore, huge, it is also extremely old. It was built in about 1530 and has a  range of original features, including Tudor fireplaces throughout. And there is also a secret tunnel, which is said to lead to the neighbouring stately home, Bentley Priory. Sprawling: Priory House in Stanmore, North London, owned by film and television composer Laurie Johnson, has been put on the market for £4.6million . Johnson, 87 – who wrote the theme tunes for the television shows The Professionals, This Is Your Life and The Avengers – did much of his composing at the Grade II listed house, where he has lived since 1962. It is on sale for £4.595 million. Included in the grounds is a rose garden that was started by the late author Dame Barbara Cartland. They were great friends and, through his film production company, Laurie made several movies of her novels. When Laurie mentioned how much he liked her rose bushes, Dame Barbara – who lived for 50 years at Camfield Place, the other side of Hertfordshire from Stanmore – decided  he must have them, and the bushes were transported to his garden. ‘She was a great professional, first-class,’ Laurie says of her. ‘She was a very good historian. 'She basically was always telling the same story, a love story, but it was  the authenticity of the background that mattered.’ Long history: The Grade II listed house has seven bedrooms and has a range of the original features from the Tudor age when it was built . Priory House was built on the foundations of what is believed to have been the original 13th Century priory. As well as the seven bedrooms, one of which has an en suite shower room, the house has two bathrooms,  a drawing room, a formal sitting room, separate dining room, family room, library, study and conservatory. The property also includes a former coach house and garage with attached stables. Planning permission has been granted for this area to be converted into a separate three-bedroom home. Laurie wants to sell because ‘my mobility is not great, so we [he and  his wife Dot] want to find something more suitable’. But he has no intention of retiring: he is currently planning a film version of The Professionals and is working on new scores. He seems unfazed by the MBE he was awarded this year. All he will say is that ‘it sounds good!’ He is happier, unsurprisingly, talking about his work. ‘Theme tunes are like sneezing – they happen very quickly,’ he says. ‘They are like calling cards so that the audience knows what they are in for.’ Laurie has also written film scores at Priory House, including the one for Dr Strangelove, the Stanley Kubrick-directed 1964 satire starring Peter Sellers. ‘Film scores are a much more detailed, lengthy process,’ he says. ‘You are writing for specific scenes and developments in stories and you have to play on the subconscious of the audience. That’s the purpose of a film score.’ Hot shots: Mr Johnson, who has lived in the house since the 1960s, wrote theme tunes for The Professionals, pictured, This Is Your Life and The Avengers at the house . He says that while he does discuss each  of his scores with the film’s director, ‘you have to come to your own conclusions of how to interpret the film musically’. He explains how the writing process works: ‘You see the whole film and then you identify where the music is going to play’ – and adds that great film-makers set themselves apart because they ‘realise you have to combine all the senses’. ‘Fifty per cent of film-making is down to the soundtrack,’ he says. He recalls Stanley Kubrick asking him what he thought of Dr Strangelove when he saw  it. Laurie told him: ‘If you want the audience to feel as if they have been punched in the stomach, you’ve done it!’ Kubrick replied: ‘That’s exactly what I want!’ Lee Martin, director at estate agents Preston Bennett, says: ‘Priory House is the epitome  of tranquillity and offers the ultimate in security and peace of mind. 'Perfectly designed to offer respite, this home boasts truly exceptional grounds and private access to Bentley Priory Nature Reserve. ‘With its enchanting grounds, which extend to 3.3 acres, it’s no surprise that one feels as if they are miles out in the countryside instead of in the heart of suburbia.’ Preston Bennett  (020 8954 0060, email finehomes@prestonbennett.co.uk)","Laurie Johnson, 87, wrote themes for The Professionals and The Avengers .

"By . Emma Glanfield for MailOnline . Rolling around in mud, sucking their trunks playfully and seeking comfort from their human carers, these incredible images give a rare insight into one of the world’s most majestic animals. With their trunks intertwined and standing side-by-side for protection, this adorable family of elephants are just some of the 101 orphaned elephants which have been rescued by the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT) since 2001. Each elephant has a unique story of survival, orphaned either by ivory poaching, human-wildlife conflict or habitat destruction. These adorable young elephants are just some of the 101 animals which have been rescued from remote parts of Kenya by the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust since 2001 . Each has been rescued from either ivory poachers, human conflict or habitat destruction and has been taken into care at the trust's elephant orphanage in Nairobi . Workers at the charity, which was founded in Britain and has headquarters in Nairobi, now care for the young elephants - helping them recover from injury and torture . The young elephants enjoy being part of the 'orphan' family and workers ensure they are integrated with both animals of their kind and humans before they are released . They were rescued from remote regions of Kenya by the British-based charity’s Orphans’ Project, which exists to reintegrate orphaned infant elephants back into the wild. Rob Brandford, director of the DSWT, said: ‘Each orphan has their own tragic rescue story, but their struggle of survival and zest for life is infectious. ‘Sadly Africa’s elephants are under threat from poachers for their ivory. Each of the 101 elephants rescued and in the care of the DSWT has been orphaned, but they have been afforded a new herd in the form of our unusual human-elephant family.’ Once rescued, infants are flown or driven to the charity’s orphanage in Nairobi National Park - Kenya’s safe haven for orphaned elephants. Hand–reared by human elephant-carers who provide 24 hour specialist care, they are ultimately reintegrated back into the wild at one of the DSWT’s three reintegration centres in the Greater Tsavo Conservation Area when grown. In the last year alone, ivory poaching has resulted in a 500 per cent increase in the number of elephants rescued by the trust. Rob Brandford, David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust director, said: ‘Each orphan has their own tragic rescue story, but their struggle of survival and zest for life is infectious' One of the youngest orphans to be rescued is Mbegu - a seven-week-old baby elephant who was saved after being pelted with stones and spears in a revenge attack . In the last year alone, ivory poaching has resulted in a 500 per cent increase in the number of elephants rescued by the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust . One of the youngest orphans to be rescued is Mbegu - a seven-week-old baby elephant who was saved after being pelted with stones and spears in a revenge attack. The young animal was attacked by locals in Ol Lentille - a remote part of Kenya - after a local woman was killed by an adult elephant. The aggressive elephant was later killed by the Kenya Wildlife Service but an ensuing fracas saw young Mbegu separated from her herd. She was chased by a group of local people and tormented with spears and stones. Fortunately, the calf was saved after rangers from the Naibunga Conservancy stood between the enraged crowd and the elephant, protecting her from further danger. The young elephants are cared for at the orphanage and taught how to feed, share, love and care for each other before being carefully reintegrated back into the wild . Once rescued from danger or conflict, infants are flown or driven to the charity’s orphanage in Nairobi National Park, which is Kenya’s safe haven for orphaned elephants . The young elephants are ultimately reintegrated back into the wild at one of the trust's three reintegration centres in the Greater Tsavo Conservation Area when grown . A rescue team from DSWT was then sent from the charity's Nairobi Headquarters to collect the young animal, who was ‘injured, stressed and deeply traumatised’. She has now recovered from her injuries and is being cared for at the orphanage where she has learnt to feed herself and enjoys playing with the fellow orphans. Another elephant rescued by the charity, called Barsilinga, had a tragic start to life after his mother was shot by poachers. With no chance of survival, his mother had to be euthanised and he was taken into the care of the DSWT. A rescue team, based at the trust's Nairobi Headquarters, is regularly called into action to help rescue injured  elephants and most are taken into care at the orphanage .

"By . Joel Christie For Mailonline . A Seattle father has been reunited with his baby daughter after the little girl was kidnapped during a car theft on Thursday. The father, who has not been named, left his black SUV running and his daughter in her car seat around 3.15 pm as he ran into a West Seattle convenience store near 16th Ave. SW and SW Holden Street. A young man who had been loitering around the store for most of the day then jumped in the car, backed up and drove off, just as the father came out of the shop. Surveilance footage taken from inside the store captured the moment the man chased after his car, with witnesses telling KOMO News he was screaming: 'My baby, my baby!'

Witnesses say the man was screaming 'my baby!' as the SUV took off down the street . The man ran to a fire house across the street for help. Some 19 minutes later, police in a helicopter saw the SUV abandoned in the middle of a street one mile from the convenience store. It appears the thief fled the vehicle upon realizing their was child onboard. One witness, Carlisia Minnis, noticed the car stranded on the road and through the windows saw there was a car seat.

"By . Wills Robinson for MailOnline . A care home has been fined £85,000 after a dementia sufferer was crushed to death by a wardrobe that wasn't fitted properly to her bedroom wall. Claire Hughes, 64, who suffered from dementia, was 'obsessed' with dressing up in her old clothes, and would put on layer upon layer if left by herself at the Chase Care Centre in Watford, Hertfordshire. St Albans Crown Court heard how she was found dead underneath her wardrobe after pulling it free from - sending it toppling onto her in December 2011. Dementia-sufferer Claire Hughes, 64, was found dead at Chase Care Centre in Watford, Hertfordshire, after her wardrobe fell on top of her . The court heard on Thursday how the wardrobe had not been fixed to the wall properly and had only been screwed into chipboard on the wall. Mrs Hughes had been trying to get to her clothes, pulling at the locked wardrobe until it fell on top of her, crushing her to death. The court heard how Mrs Hughes was diagnosed with dementia in 2007 and would only let her husband, a retired company director, feed her. Sandra Dias, an inspector for the Health and Safety Executive - which brought the prosecution - said the care home was aware of Mrs Hughes' obsession with her clothing and should have taken steps to secure the wardrobe. She said: 'Mrs Hughes' death was a wholly preventable tragedy caused by unacceptable management failings on the part of Life Style Care PLC. They put her at unnecessary risk. 'The company was aware of her obsession with clothing and that is why they locked her wardrobe. 'In doing so it was eminently foreseeable that she would attempt to open it using force, and that the wardrobe therefore needed to be rigid and secure. 'Working in a care home is a specialised job, which involves dealing with vulnerable people. 'Care homes must ensure that they have the correct training in place for all their employees, and that they work to adequately assess and eliminate all significant risks.' St Albans Crown Court heard the wardrobe was full of old clothes she was 'obsessed' with and had not been fitted to the wall properly . Dominic Kay, defending, said: 'It is a very, very sad case. Mrs Hughes was well-liked by the staff. The company expresses its regret and remorse to her family. 'It was not foreseen that she would use the force she did on the wardrobe. It is not a case of corner cutting. It was an oversight.' The company which runs the care home LifeStyle Care - which has 37 care homes around the UK - admitted failing to discharge its duty under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. It said it had now ensured the wardrobes in all of its care homes were now secured with longer screws fixed to timber batons and fixed to a concrete wall. Judge John Plumstead said: 'This unfortunate lady was intent on gaining access to her clothing. 'Steps should have been taken to ensure the wardrobe was fixed. The attempt to fix the wardrobe was botched. The wardrobe was very poorly secured indeed. The company failed in their duty to keep this lady safe.' The firm was fined £85,000 and ordered to pay £48,000 in court costs.","Claire Hughes, 64, was found dead at Chase Care Centre in Watford .

"By . Sanchez Manning for The Mail on Sunday . The parents who took their terminally ill boy from his hospital bed and fled Britain were last night found in Spain, along with their son. Police tracked down five-year-old Ashya King with his father Brett and mother Naghmeh to a hostel in southern Spain. The parents were arrested and were last night in police custody, while Ashya was rushed to a specialist hospital in Malaga with a police guard for urgent medical treatment. 'Leave us in peace: Brett King and his terminally ill son Ashya, who was removed by his parents from hospital on Thursday, are seen in the video posted on YouTube  last night . His parents, who are Jehovah’s Witnesses, had taken Ashya from Southampton General Hospital on Thursday, after doctors told them he had only months to live. Ashya had a brain tumour the  size of a tangerine removed last weekend – but the family had been told the cancer would return and would probably be inoperable. He was left with very limited movement, unable to speak and dependent on a machine for food. Hampshire Police broke the news of the parents’ arrest on Facebook, saying: ‘Ashya has been found. He is in Spain. 'Police are speaking to his mum and dad and we are waiting to hear on Ashya’s condition. This is all we know at this time, but he has been found. Thank you to everyone who has been incredible in helping us spread this appeal.’ International chase: Brett and Naghmeh King have been arrested after taking Ashya from Southampton General Hospital on Thursday, and transporting him to Spain via France . Hampshire officers will be travelling to Malaga today to aid the investigation. Within an hour of the arrest, Ashya’s oldest brother Naveed posted a video on YouTube showing his father explaining their actions. Holding his son’s hand tenderly and touching  his fingers, Mr King, 51, insisted Ashya had been safe and well, saying:  ‘We were most disturbed today to find that his face was all over the internet and newspapers, and we have been labelled as kidnappers and putting his life at risk.’ He added: ‘Call off this ridiculous chase. We are not neglecting our son. He’s in perfectly good health. ‘My son’s smiling, he’s happy. We’re doing things as a family. We just want to be left in peace.’ Mr King said that he wanted  his son to have a special treatment called proton beam therapy, but had been told by doctors in Southampton that it was not available  on the NHS. ‘He’s very sick. I just want to get on with his treatment. And I’m not coming back  to England if I cannot give him the treatment I want.’ Earlier in the day, a European arrest warrant had been issued for Mr and Mrs King for neglecting Ashya’s medical needs. Armed Spanish police were waiting outside the couple’s Costa del Sol  holiday home, but they were apprehended after checking into a hostel called Esperanza in Benajarafe,  14 miles east of Malaga. A police source said: ‘We were alerted after the couple checked into the hostel in Benajarafe. We arrested them in their bedroom.’ The couple are expected to be taken to Madrid today for an extradition hearing. The couple are expected to oppose extradition so they can argue at a new hearing they should be released on bail for humanitarian reasons. Ashya has been taken to the Hospital Materno-Infantil in Malaga which specialises in treating seriously ill children. Doctors there are liaising with the boy’s British medics, but Hampshire Police said it was too soon to say when he might come home. Hiding place: The King family were tracked down at Hostel Esperanza in Benajarafe, 14 miles east of Malaga . Naveed was last night sleeping with his five other siblings at one  of the rooms at the hostel. A source close to the case said: ‘The oldest boy has been left in charge of the other children. He is due to check out on Sunday.’ Mr King said he found out about alternative treatments for his son after going online. He said on the YouTube video: ‘I’ve come to find out through the internet. The long-term side effects for my son are secondary malignant cancers, so the radiation will cause more cancers.’ Children who receive radiotherapy have a far greater risk of side effects including damaged DNA, reduced IQ, infertility and limited growth development. On the video Ashya is seen hooked up to a feeding machine. Mr King said: ‘There’s been a lot of talk about this machine – as you see it’s all plugged in, we have got loads  of these feeds here, we have iron supplements and we have Calpol. ‘As you can see that there is nothing wrong with him. He is very happy actually since we took him out of hospital. He has been smiling a lot more.’ Explaining more about the proton beam treatment, he added: ‘We asked the NHS if we could please  go to America, Switzerland or another country to get proton beam – but they said no.’ Mr King added he would sell his home to pay for the therapy, and had looked into getting treatment in Prague. Family friend Inma Martinez Macias described the Kings as a ‘very law-abiding, family’, adding: ‘They love their children and they take very good care of them. If they were bad parents they wouldn’t have allowed their son to have operations in the first place.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Police tracked down five-year-old Ashya King and his parents in Spain .

RAAF transport planes with elite special forces soldiers will deliver arms and munitions to Kurdish fighters battling militants in Iraq instead of air-dropping weapons, Defence Force Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin said.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott confirmed to reporters in Canberra on Sunday Australian planes would deliver military equipment to Iraq . 'We want to make sure that we know where the arms and munitions go when we deliver,' Air Chief Marshal Binskin said on Sunday at a joint press conference with the Prime Minister. 'They will be landing and handing them over to officials from the Peshmerga.' The SAS soldiers are believed to be at Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates and will accompany the RAAF C-130J Hercules and C-17A Globemaster aircraft when the equipment is transported, Fairfax Media reports. 'This is about what is right for our country and what is best for our world,' Mr Abbott said on Sunday. He described the situation overseas as 'severe' and spoke of a specific type of terrorist 'who hate us not because of what we do, but because of what we are'. Mr Abbott said he agreed to join the US-led effort and Australian forces had already participated in a humanitarian airdrop to northern Iraq. The Prime Minister also assured that no specific request to step up Australian military involvement in the area had been made and if we were asked the decision would be made under very specific criteria. Mr Abbott (right), alongside Chief of the Defence Force Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin (left), said Australian forces had already participated in a humanitarian airdrop . A Royal Malaysian Air Force C-130 Hercules is one of the planes set to be used to carry military weapons . 'Australia will join international partners to help the anti-ISIL forces in Iraq,' Mr Abbott said. 'The situation in Iraq represents a humanitarian catastrophe.' He remains in close contact with the US and other allies. Meanwhile, Greens senators are out outraged by the decision the Abbott government made without the consultation of parliament, The Age reports. Independent Andrew Wilkie is said to have told reporters in Hobart that cabinet should have had an input on the matter. 'If Tony Abbott wants us to be gun runners for the Kurds at the behest of the United States then we are part of the war,' he said, according to the website. Greens leader Christine Milne sided with Mr Wilkie, urging Mr Abbott to put Australia's involvement in Iraq at the top of the list for discussion in parliament on Monday. Australian planes will fly alongside aircraft from Canada, Italy, France, the United Kingdom and the United States. Prime Minister Tony Abbott responded to the request from the Obama Administration . 'Australia will join international partners to help the anti-ISIL forces in Iraq,' said Prime Minister Tony Abbott (pictured). An RAAF C-17 Globemaster is will be delivering arms and munitions to Iraq after Australian agreed to requests from the US . The Iraq government and other regional countries will co-ordinate Australia's contribution. Immigration Minister Scott Morrison declined to comment on reports Australia could also be asked to consider deploying . Super Hornets for air strikes. The US had not made that request. 'We're not going to get ahead of ourselves,' he told Sky News. However, the government was looking at Australia's military capability across a range of areas and would consider other . requests. 'Defining the mission and the objective was critical,' Mr Morrison said. 'Let's not kid ourselves either, (IS) does present a threat. What we're seeing there is evil incarnate,' he said. Labor's foreign affairs spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek gave bipartisan support for the weapons drop, saying international . backing for anti-ISIL forces was the 'logical next step'. 'Where you have reasonably effective fighting force ... being the only thing standing between IS and civilian . populations ... at risk of genocide or ethic cleansing, then there is an international . The US has stepped up its strikes against Islamic militants in northern Iraq this month, and is considering extending air strikes to Syria. Since August 8 the US has conducted more than 80 air strikes, according to Central Command. The wreckage of a vehicle is seen after a US air strike, at Mosul Dam, northern Iraq . US warplanes have hit a wide range of Islamic State militant targets, including artillery, armoured personnel carriers, armoured Humvees, light trucks, mortar positions, checkpoints and roadside bomb emplacements. There's potential for the air campaign to expand into Syria, in which case the US would have to call on aircraft and other elements of its military based in the Middle East and possibly Europe. Australia could also join the US's air campaign, as well as extend its military role in Iraq more generally, as was laid out in Mr Abbott's foreign policy speech at Adelaide University last week, The Australian reported. 'We will do what we reasonably and prudently can to encourage American leadership because that leadership provided global security and stability,' the Prime Minister said. 'We are talking to our partners about how we might contribute to international efforts to protect people against the advances of the ISIS terrorists. 'This is a potential humanitarian disaster,' Mr Abbott said, in reference to the tens of thousands of people - mostly women and children - surrounded by Islamic State fighters threatening to kill them. Previously, Australia has been unable to answer US calls for air strike assistance due to concerns about the self-defence capabilities of RAAF aircraft. But The Australian reports that the RAAF now have aircraft suitable for Iraq.

"By . Louise Eccles For Daily Mail . Bankers and finance workers sidestepped about £50million in tax by deferring their bumper bonuses until after the 50p tax rate had been axed, new figures suggest. Bonuses for City workers rose to £15billion between April 2013 and March 2014 – a 14 per cent rise on the previous year and an increase of £1.8billion. But experts believe at least £1billion of this bumper rise is bonuses owed from the previous year which were cynically deferred for a few weeks until after the top tax rate had dropped to 45p. Bonuses for City workers rose to £15billion between April 2013 and March 2014 (File photo) It means some workers may have received two bonuses in one financial year. Chancellor George Osborne cut the tax paid on earnings over £150,000 from 50 per cent to 45 per cent on April 6 last year. The Office for National Statistics showed £2.1bn was paid in bonuses to financial and insurance workers during April and May 2013 – in the weeks after the tax rate dropped – compared with £1.1billion during this period the previous year. The ONS said the shift in the typical bonus period, which is usually between December and March, ‘was likely due to companies deferring bonus payments until after the change in tax rates’. The ONS stated in their report, issued yesterday: ‘Due to the fact that some bonuses were deferred from March to April 2013, two significant bonus seasons occurred in the 2013/14 financial year, causing a large increase in bonuses paid.’ Experts said they believed the deferral of bonuses – and the loss of five pence in the pound on these payments – could have cost UK taxpayers as much as £50million in tax, which would be enough to pay the annual salaries of more than 660 hospital consultants. On average, City workers received £13,800 in bonuses last year, compared with £11,900 the previous year. This is almost eight times the average private sector bonus of £1,800 and 70 times the public sector bonus of £200. Yesterday, critics said the high bonus figures for the months of April and May 2013 pointed to a cynical tax dodge by City workers. Total bonuses across all industries soared by 12 per cent to £41.3billion in 2013-14 – almost as high as the pre-crisis peak in 2007-08 of £42.5billion – and the equivalent of £1,500 per employee (File photo) Chris Leslie, a Labour MP and shadow financial secretary, said: ‘These figures show the effect the cut to the 50p tax rate had on bankers’ behaviour and how many millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money was lost. It is clear many executives were allowed to avoid the tax rate by deferring their bonuses. It is hardly surprising that so many took advantage of this when the Chancellor announced it so far in advance. Their gain has been at the taxpayers’ expense and at the expense of frontline public services.’ Deferred bonuses across all sectors – but particularly in the financial industry – helped to boost overall bonus figures, along with the improved economy. Total bonuses across all industries soared by 12 per cent to £41.3billion in 2013-14 – almost as high as the pre-crisis peak in 2007-08 of £42.5billion – and the equivalent of £1,500 per employee. Even if you exclude April 2013 – when many bonuses were deferred – and take the figures from May 2013 to April 2014, overall bonuses still rose by 4.9 per cent to £40.5billion. This included a 6 per cent rise across all industries excluding the finance sector to £26.1billion, the highest since records began in 2000-2001.","Chancellor George Osborne cut tax paid on earnings over £150,000 from 50 to 45% .

"By . Steve Hopkins for MailOnline . An unprovoked attack by a drunken stranger left Wayne Urwin not only fighting for his life, but it has permanently changed his appearance and cost him him his home, his job and his car. The father-of-two needed emergency surgery to ease bleeding on his brain after Aaron Robson knocked him to the ground with a single punch after spotting him outside a Northumberland pub. And as the 37-year-old lay unconscious in the Morpeth allegyway, his 20-year-old attacker kept punching him until a stranger intervened and told him to stop. Wayne Urwin's head now sinks to one side following an unprovoked attack outside a bar, and his two children are now 'frightened' of his appearance . Mr Urwin has been left with a scar that snakes across the side of his head and is awaiting reconstructive surgery which will include having a metal plate put in his head . The father-of-two was placed in an induced coma after the assault on March 30 and spent a month in hospital recovering; his family were told he might not survive . Mr Urwin now has a huge scar around his head and his skull slopes down on one side. Throughout the day his head changes shape and he is still awaiting reconstructive surgery, including the implant of a metal plate in his head. Mr Urwin said of the March 30 assault: ‘One punch ruined my life.' Robson, of Cramlington, was jailed for three years and two months after appearing at Newcastle Crown Court on Thursday, but Urwin said his life has been changed forever. He said: 'My life has completely changed and I struggle to see a way back to normality.' Mr Urwin said Robson is likely to be released from prison within 19 months, 'which to me is ridiculous'. Wayne Urwin, left, was left with horrific injuries after he was attacked by Aaron Robson, right, in Morpheth . He said: 'It’s going to take much more than 19 months to get over this. It’s probably going to effect me for the rest of my life.' Mr Urwin, a budding DJ and warehouse supervisor, was leaving a pub after a night out with friends when he encountered Robson. After being taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle he was placed in an induced coma as doctors battled to save his life. Wayne Urwin, right, with his father Colin, left, before he suffered life-changing head injuries following the brutal attack . His devastated family were told to expect the worst, and were warned it was unlikely Mr Urwin would survive. Against the odds, a month later he returned home - but everything had changed. Unable to work, Mr Urwin was forced to give up the flat he rented in Cramlington and move in with his girlfriend. He also had to sell his car. The incident caused significant stress for his children, Marley, seven, and four-year-old Georgina. The children live with his ex and because he has a brain injury and is prone to seizures, he can't drive to see them. Mr Urwin said: 'It’s so hard not to be able to see them as much as I did. 'This has changed everything.' In a victim impact statement read to court he described how his children were 'frightened to look at me' and how he had lost the 'closeness I had with them'. His statement said: 'I can’t play with them or lift them up. 'As the day goes by my head starts to sink down. I know I look strange.' Mr Urwin said his brain injury has also significantly changed his personality. Where he was once 'laid back', he now has a short-temper. In mitigation Richard Bloomfield said Robson, who had earlier pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm without intent, was: 'A young man who has never been in this situation before. He’s of good character and is described as hard-working and caring. He is extremely remorseful.' But Judge Hickey said he had no choice but to jail him because of the 'catastrophic effect' the attack had on Mr Urwin's life.","Wayne Urwin had been on a night out with friends when he was set upon .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The wagtail is no longer a regular visitor to Britain’s gardens as its populations is in long-term decline, warns a new report. The latest Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) annual report revealed that numbers are falling of all three UK breeding wagtail species. However, researchers say the reasons behind the trend are unclear. Yellow Wagtails in severe decline, a 43 per cent  reduction between 1995 and 2012 . The three wagtail species spotted on our shores are the Yellow Wagtail, a farmland bird that migrates to sub-Saharan Africa, and two which largely remain in the UK over the winter, the Grey Wagtail, a river specialist, and the familiar Pied Wagtail. Researchers said the races of both Pied and Yellow Wagtail breeding in the UK nest almost nowhere else in the world. Yellow Wagtails are in severe decline, and these latest BBS figures reveal a 43 per cent reduction between 1995 and 2012. Researchers suggest that changes in agricultural practices have driven this decline, but the species is a long-distance migrant so conditions overseas cannot be ruled out. Grey Wagtail, which has been on the Amber list of Birds of Conservation Concern since 2002, has shown a decline of 32 per cent since the start of the survey and Pied Wagtail a shallower decline of 11 per cent, the researchers said. They added that both Grey and Pied Wagtail BBS trends match closely those of the more riverine focused Waterways Breeding Bird Survey (WBBS) which has recorded a rapid decline of both species along rivers and canals. They said that the Pied Wagtail decline is steeper in the WBBS trends than the BBS trends, which covers all habitats, suggesting that there might be a common factor affecting both species relating to the riverine habitat. Researchers said the races of both Pied )above) and Yellow Wagtail breeding in the UK nest almost nowhere else in the world . Sarah Harris, BBS Organiser at the British Trust for Ornithology, said: “I find it fascinating that three seemingly similar birds, the Yellow, Grey and Pied Wagtail can lead such different lives and face such a variety of challenges. “With the UK races of two of these species - Pied and Yellow Wagtails - being largely confined to our islands, these population changes are of global conservation significance.” She added: “The Breeding Bird Survey is an invaluable tool for assessing the annual and long-term population trends of common UK breeding birds and can be used as a baseline for further, more species-specific research. “Of course, none of the 110 UK species trends would be possible without the thousands of dedicated BBS volunteers carrying out the survey across the UK.” Dr Mark Eaton, Principal Conservation Scientist at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), added: “This survey is most valuable for showing us trends stretching back nearly 20 years. “However, it is also provides a snapshot into changes between years, and this report reveals that 2012 was clearly a bad year for some of our breeding birds. “A cold spring followed by the wettest summer on record have to be prime candidates for why many species showed a significant decline in 2013. Of the 36 species which showed a significant change in numbers between 2012 and 2013, 34 decreased. For some species, such as turtle dove, these recent falls compound long-term declines.” Researchers added that the 1995-2012 BBS trends for Grey Partridge and Skylark show that both of these farmland species remain in decline, falling by 56 per cent and 24 per cent respectively. They added that research into both species has identified agricultural intensification as a key factor in their decline, and management solutions that are effective at local scales have been developed for each. The BBS report looks at population trends for 110 bird species across the UK, which have been calculated using counts made by volunteer bird watchers. The report is jointly conducted by the British Trust for Ornithology, the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.","Yellow Wagtails in severe decline,  a 43% reduction between 1995 and 2012 .

"By . Steph Cockroft for MailOnline . A jilted man who stabbed his teenage love rival to death after discovering he was dating his ex-girlfriend has been jailed for life. Will Blencowe, 21, attacked 17-year-old Connor Tremble in a jealous rage at his flat the day before Valentine’s Day. Blencowe, from Banbury, Oxfordshire, had travelled to the victim's flat in Oxford after discovering was seeing his ex-girlfriend Aimee Harrison, 20. After the 'vicious' attack, Blencowe fled more than 50 miles away, leaving the victim with multiple stab wounds, including in the lung, back and buttocks. Will Blencowe, 21, pictured left, from Banbury, Oxfordshire, has been jailed for life with a minimum of 23 years for murdering 17-year-old Connor Tremble, pictured right, from Oxford in a jealous rage . Connor spent two days fighting for his life in hospital but died 40 hours after the attack. Today, Blencowe was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum of 23 years. He showed no emotion as he was taken down to the cells from Oxford Crown Court to begin his sentence. When the sentence was announced, Connor’s mother Lisa Tremble sighed with relief and said aloud 'always have faith'. Speaking after the sentencing, she said the motive behind her son's 'horrific' murder had been 'nothing more than jealousy' and that Connor was 'a very special young man'. During the three-week trial, the court heard that Miss Harrison and Blencowe had a rocky four-year relationship in which Blencowe was often jealous and over-protective. Miss Harrison described how she was concerned by Blencowe's obsession with knives, of which she said he had at least four, including a machete. The couple broke up in September 2013 and Miss Harrison began dating Connor early this year. They tried to keep the relationship quiet but Blencowe found out. Blencowe told the court that, on the day Connor was stabbed, he intended to end his own life and went to see Connor after being told he had drugs. Blencowe, pictured left, with Aimee Harrison, 20. The pair were a couple for about four years but broke up in September. Ms Harrison tried to keep her new relationship with Connor a secret but Blencowe found out . He caught a train from Banbury to Oxford, before taking a taxi to near Connor’s flat. The court heard that, by some 'terrible coincidence', Connor's flat had been left open that day as painters had been there redecorating. Blencowe went inside the flat and waited for Connor. When he returned home around 6.30pm, Blencowe attacked Connor with a knife. Connor’s flatmate Kyle Martin heard his friend shouting and went to the lounge to see what was happening. There, he found Connor bleeding on the floor, saying: 'I’m dying.' Connor's mother Lisa said her son was a 'very special young man' and that the motive behind his murder was jealousy . Connor was rushed to Oxford’s John Radcliffe Hospital where he underwent emergency surgery. Meanwhile, Blencowe, had fled to Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, where he checked into the Croft Guest House. He moved to another guest house the next day but police tracked him down and arrested him on suspicion of attempted murder at around 4pm on February 14, while Connor was still alive. Prosecutor Richard Barton previously told the court: 'When they told him it was attempted murder he repeated that. He said ""attempted murder?"" And he giggled.' During the case, the court heard Blencowe had mental health difficulties and was living at special accommodation. The day Connor was stabbed Blencowe had a meeting with a key worker, appearing emotional and telling her he still loved Miss Harrison. When she tried to cheer him up, he said: 'What’s the point? I’m going to be dead or in jail.' Later that afternoon Miss Harrison called Blencowe after finding out he had been making threats towards Connor. She asked him: 'What should I tell Connor if he sees you?' He responded: 'Just tell him to run.' Paying tribute to her son after the hearing, Ms Tremble said: 'Will Blencowe is responsible for committing the most horrific and violent murder of our beloved Connor which he carried out with detailed planning. Oxford Crown Court heard Blencowe stabbed the victim several times, before fleeing more than 50 miles away. Connor was left fighting for his life in hospital but died 40 hours after the attack . 'The motive behind Connor’s murder was nothing more than jealousy on Will Blencowe’s part and he showed Connor no mercy. 'No family should ever have to go through what we have gone through and are still going through. 'Connor was a very special young man who was vulnerable due to his special needs. He touched the hearts of everyone who knew him and everyone that he met.' Friends Bradley Jones and Grant Clemens were acquitted of perverting the course of justice after being accused of helping Blencowe flee.","Will Blencowe, 21, stabbed Connor Tremble, 17, at victim's flat in Oxford .

"By . Ollie Gillman for MailOnline . Two drug gangs who attempted to launch a 'vast' cocaine smuggling operation by targeting a dock worker have been jailed for a total of nearly 150 years. Ten men - nine gangsters and the worker at Portsmouth Docks, Shaun Wilson - will serve between eight-and-a-half and 20 years each for conspiring to smuggle in millions of pounds of the Class A drug in exotic fruit containers. Investigators at the National Crime Agency (NCA) said two organised crime groups targeted Wilson, 46, so they could exploit his knowledge of security procedures. Investigators covertly watched as gang members and a dock worker met at service stations and parks to plan out cocaine imports (left to right Errol Heibner, Norman Burton and Shaun Wilson) Jailed: The ten men were sentenced to a total of almost 150 years for conspiracy to smuggle million pounds of cocaine into the UK through Portsmouth Docks. (Top row from left to right) Richard Edwards, Norman Burton, Audley Powell, Shaun Wilson, Eric Ward, (bottom row from left to right) Errol Heibner, Jason Flisher, Donald Chambers, David Roberts and Roy Godber) The gangs met him separately on several occasions in service stations, pubs and parks to plan cocaine imports. Each shipment was to be timed to coincide with Wilson's shifts so he could remove the drugs from the docks without detection. However, NCA officers were watching the meetings and swooped when the first shipment - 26kg (57lb) of the drug hidden in a container of pineapples on a boat from Costa Rica - was on its way to the UK in November 2010. The drugs would have had street value of around £3million. All of the first gang members were arrested and the apprehension of Wilson stopped the second group from succeeding with their plan to bring in another huge haul in a container of bananas. The full extent of the plots was disclosed today when reporting restrictions were lifted after Audley Powell, 56, became the tenth defendant to be sentenced. He was jailed at Winchester Crown Court for eight-and-a-half years. Wilson was found guilty in September 2011 of the first conspiracy to import cocaine and was jailed for 14 years. He admitted involvement in the second plot and received a concurrent eight-year sentence. National Crime Agency investigators believe the first shipment they seized was worth £3million on the street . The NCA seized £26kg of cocaine that was stashed inside a pineapple container that set sail from Costa Rica . Gerry McGowan, of the NCA, said:'Wilson abused his position of trust by providing the crime groups with details of suitable ships, routes and times. He was going to ensure he was on duty to guarantee safe removal of the drugs. 'The long term plan was to import vast quantities of cocaine on a regular basis. 'Protecting our borders is a priority for the NCA. We will be relentless in pursuing criminals who try to bring drugs into the country, however long it takes, and wherever they try to hide.' Powell, of Catford, south London, was part of the second group. He was on the run until November last year, when investigators traced him to Jamaica and brought him back to the UK. He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to import cocaine in January this year. Two of the gang members involved in the 26kg plot absconded during their trial and fled to Malta, but were convicted in their absence and sentenced to 20 years in prison. The men, Roy Godber, 64, from Rainham in Essex, and David Roberts, 61, from Romford, Essex were tracked down and extradited to the UK in 2013. During the crackdown on drug smuggling, officers found a secret compartment behind a car's number plate . Others sentenced were Jason Flisher, 43, from Folkestone, Kent (16 years), Richard Edwards, 51, from Barking, east London (20 years) and Eric Ward, 51, from Portsmouth (10 years). Those involved in the second gang who were sentenced were Errol Heibner, 69, from Bow, East London and Norman Burton, 57, from Catford, south London, who were both jailed for 14 years. Donald Chambers, from Charlton, was jailed for 13 years. The total of all the men's sentences was 149-and-a-half years. A further two men were convicted of money laundering offences after being arrested at the Channel Tunnel as part of the wider operation. They were handed suspended sentences.","Ten men jailed for conspiring to smuggle millions of pounds of drugs into UK .

"By . Daniel Mills for Daily Mail Australia . Mental health disorders such as depression and work-related stress are now the leading cause of long-term sickness absence in working-age Australians. The absences, many of them permanent, are costing the economy more than $12 billion a year in lost productivity and disability benefits and the risks are just as inherent in teachers and lawyers as they are in front-line emergency service workers. But one Australian group aligned with mental health advocacy is helping treat the 1.4 million Australians coping with the disorder - by introducing new workplace programs to combat increased stress levels. Sam Harvey is helping workplaces better cope with the stigma associated with mental health . A team of researchers from the Black Dog Institute and UNSW are helping people deal with work-related . Workplace Mental Health Researcher Sam Harvey from the Black Dog Institute is teaming up with employers to manage staff stress levels. Firefighters are on the front-line coping with trauma . He, along with a team of researchers from the university of NSW, have identified a number of interventions that are effective in reducing significant mental illness for working-age Australians. 'Consider workplace health promotion strategies that include both physical activity incentives and mental health awareness and education,' he said. He said people in occupations with regular exposure to traumatic events, such the police, paramedics, fire fighters, military personnel, medical staff and journalists have historically been associated with post traumatic stress. His team is helping reduce this - by way of  therapy and relaxation training at the place where people spend 'one-half of their waking lives' - at work. Along with in-house workplace counselling and the provision of formal return to work programs for people recovering from mental illness, he said the programs are showing to have an effect in reducing depression. Mr Harvey said employers often do not know how to cope with the issue of mental health in the workplace. 'It is easy for employers to recognise a physical illness, for instance someone who has hurt there leg,' he said. 'They get a get well card and an office on the ground floor.' 'But for someone coming back from depression they (employers and colleagues) don't how to speak to them.' Other experiences such as marital distress, financial strain or dependent children can exacerbate work stress and result in strain, illness and sickness absence. In addition, other issues such as substance misuse, poor diet and limited exercise may be directly or indirectly related to either the organisation culture or personal choices. Write caption here . The Black Dog Institute is a world leader in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of mood disorders such as depression and bipolar disorder. Emergency Service personnel area the highest risk of suffering mental health issues . But despite how bad the workplace might be, Mr Harvey said the impact of unemployment on mental health is much worse. During the Global Financial Crisis, Dr Harvey said the rate of suicide in America and Europe was inflated quite dramatically as a result of job losses and financial insecurity. Some 5000 additional suicides were committed by people across America and Europe in 2008 - the year the GFC hit. In Australia, the problem was less severe. In Australia issues such as 'downsizing corporations,' highlighted most recently by the closure of Holden's Australian arm, are adding to mental health stress on working-aged Australians. In the northern suburbs of Adelaide, at the company's Elizabeth plant, the rate of youth unemployment is already at 44 per cent and the city as a whole experienced 209 deaths by suicide in 2011 - the ABS reported. He said the risk of suicide is greater if people have been dismissed from their job - without finding another in a 12 month period. 'Involuntary job loss also increases the risk of suicide and attempted suicide,' he said. Adding that while front-line emergency service workers such as doctors and nurses are among the biggest risk groups, those employed in other 'highly demanding jobs' where there is a mismatch between effort and reward are also not immune. 'This is highly prevalent in teachers and lawyers and elements of the public sector.'","Work-related stress plays a big part in the risk of mental health and suicide .

"By . Tim Hanlon, Reuters . Cristiano Ronaldo will be rested for Real Madrid's trip to Real Sociedad on Sunday to allow the Portuguese superstar to fully recover from his recent injury problems. The 29-year-old has struggled with injuries since the back end of last season and has also not been called up by Portugal for the upcoming international break.. 'He is okay but we have preferred to use this week and the following two for him to recover fully and get him in top condition. He will not play on Sunday and is not in the squad,' said Ancelotti.

Off the pace: Ronaldo will work on his match fitness before returning to Real Madrid's squad . Ronaldo has recovered from the knee injury that affected him at the end of the last campaign but was also not 100 per cent at the World Cup in Brazil. Of late, he has been troubled with a hamstring strain he picked up in the defeat by Atletico Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup. His absence means James Rodriguez is likely to play in the three-man attack alongside Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema with Isco slotting into the midfield. Real have been weakened by the departures of Angel di Maria and Xabi Alonso this week, and Ancelotti admitted he was taken aback by the decision of the latter to go to Bayern Munich. Thumbs up: James Rodriguez will be expected to play higher up the field in Ronaldo's absence . 'It was a surprise. Everything was calm and so we were a bit surprised but we respect him a lot. Alonso is a very honest person with himself and with the Real Madrid,' said the Italian. 'He explained it well and said that he needed more motivation. Everyone here at the club respects him and it would have been very difficult to get him to change his mind. 'You can't say to a player like Xabi that he couldn't leave. I wish him luck and he has been a very important player for the team last season. 'It is possible that some people think that the team is under-strength but we have players that can perform in different positions. We have five strikers because Isco and James (Rodriguez) can play there. 'The squad is not closed because the market is still open. Maybe we will sign somebody but at the same time it is possible we won't.'","Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo is still struggling for fitness .

"By . Darren Boyle for MailOnline . A gold-rush has hit a seaside town - after a German artist buried £10,000 worth of bullion as part of an arts festival. Hundreds of amateur treasure hunters flocked to a beach at Folkestone, Kent earlier today in a bid to get their hands on a share of the solid gold deliberately buried in the sand. Excited children with their parents, hobby archeologists and competitive teens packed the beach at low tide to try and find the hidden bullion. Scroll down for video . Some treasure hunters believe that using a bigger shovel is the most effective way of finding the gold . While others have been digging in a more delicate and controlled manner akin to archaeology . More than 250 treasure hunters tried their luck earlier today digging on their own mini claims on the beach . Sculptor Michael Sailstorfer has concealed 30 24-carat gold bars on the beach at the outer harbour of the English Channel town as an art project. The search started at 4pm on Thursday with 150 people arriving to begin digging. But by Friday lunchtime there were around 250 hunters armed with buckets, spades and even metal detectors. More are expected over the weekend. Friends John Daniels, 25, and Ben Helps, 26, travelled from Bournemouth in Dorset to try and get their hands on some buried treasure. Some of the treasure hunters came armed with metal detectors with reports that the local Argos had even sold out of the high-tech devices . They stood in one of the deepest holes on the beach as the dug down looking for the precious metal. But as the tide closed in they said they have had no luck yet. John said: 'Yesterday we didn't dig, we just stood up the top and watched - getting tactics to see where other people have and haven't dug. 'It's strange because although there's quite a few people down here, everyone's doing it randomly. There's no sense of unity at the moment.' Ben - standing in his boxers as parts of the two-foot trench begin to close in around him - said: 'I quite like the them and us attitude going on at the moment. It's really competitive.' But some people have other ideas and have joined up with neighbouring diggers to form a united front. Folkestone mum Jacky Dannahy, 42, and her son Joseph have teamed up with the Bridges' family and promised to share the wealth. Dressed in a camouflage jacket, with an army hat and a patch on his eye, Joseph, six, said: 'I've made friends with these boys and now we're all like pirates. So we help each other.' The beach, which becomes partly covered at high tide, is open to the public, leaving a free-for-all approach to the adventure. University student Ross Haigger, 21, and his nephews, Oscar and Daniel Daley, said they were finding the experience a lot of fun. Daniel, five, said: 'We haven't found anything yet but we hope we will. If I do find gold I am going to buy one million thousand ice creams.' But Oscar, three, said: 'If I found treasure I'd hide it from Daniel.' One child thought he hit the jackpot when he uncovered this gold-coloured bar - unfortunately it's fake . Others seem to believe that digging in the sand was its own reward and gold bars would be a bonus . Despite rumours of the event being a hoax, today no one doubted that thousands of pounds of gold lay hidden beneath their feet. Father-of-two Mark Anderson, from Canterbury, said: 'I've watched people keep themselves to themselves, taking the whole thing very professionally, and then disappear in the middle of their dig. 'People are obviously finding them - rumour has it maybe three or four - and are just quietly wandering home with a smile on their face.' The stunt is part of the Berlin sculptor's piece for this year's Triennial - an art festival which starts tomorrow. Defying convention, this gentleman has decided to deploy his walking stick to probe the sand . The bars of gold weigh 10 grams and 20 grams and are worth £250 and £500  each. It is believed one bar was found on Thursday evening but the unknown treasure hunter has kept their find close to their chest. The gold fever meant that a branch of Argos in Folkestone completely ran out of metal detectors as savvy hunters used technology in a bid to find the loot. But it is understood metal washers have also been buried in the sand to make it harder for metal detectors to get an accurate reading - to give people with just spades a better chance of success. Some of the treasure hunters have returned to the beach for the second time today to hunt for gold . The piece, called Folkestone Digs, has been commissioned by the Bristol-based arts producers Situations, an organisation that say they are trying to change the perception of what public art can be. Director, Claire Doherty, said: 'I am so pleased with how well this has gone. 'It has been the biggest secret to keep as we've been working on it for a year. 'In fact, when we were hiding the gold at four in the morning a dog walker came up to us and said 'What're you up to then? Digging for treasure?'. 'I looked at her for a moment and then she laughed and said 'No, really, what are you doing?' We had to make up a story that we were testing the sand. 'So often public art funding is spent on a sculpture or a bauble on a roundabout and part of what we do is to say, actually sometimes a temporary project can have as much impact in the collective memory as something that has been there a long time. 'Art helps you explore places and I think what the artist wanted was exactly what you see here today - people away from their iPads and computer screens, alive with imagination and excitement.' Festival director Claire Doherty said she is very pleased with the success of the event so far . Event staff have been working on the gold plan for more than a year and managed to keep the treasure secret .","Treasure hunters frantically dug up the sand in the hunt for £10,000 of gold .

"By . Graham Hunter . Euro 2016 was already proving a difficult child before it was announced recently that the hosts, France, would play in a qualification group - despite the fact that they could lose every game, not score and still be guaranteed to be at the tournament. Previously known as 'the Euro for which it was harder not to qualify', the fact the hosts now avoid the perennial risk of two years without 'competitive' fixtures means it can now be viewed as a custom-made chance for Les Bleus to prepare for, then take advantage of, a home-based tournament. No doubt for excellent logistical reasons, France have been given a leg up. If there's been less fuss made about this pretty bizarre twist than if the hosts were England, Germany, Italy or Spain, it could be because French football appears to be in an extremely parlous state. Euro stars: France and Karim Benzema will play in a Euro 2016 qualifying group despite already being guaranteed a spot as hosts . It is the blink of an eye ago that they were rulers of the footballing planet. World Champions in 1998, kings of Europe two years later and within a couple of well-hit penalties of winning the 2006 World Cup. Much of the way English football has evolved since the late '90s is directly linked to the French pattern of doing things. Howard Wilkinson's Charter for Quality drew heavily on crosschannel learning, while the FA's St George's Park Training Centre used Clairefontaine National Technical Centre as its base model. Spain's youth development guru, Gines Melendez, often jokes that La Roja sent 'busloads' of young coaches to learn how Nantes engaged in youth development in the 1990s. Now, you can set aside the fact that France have needed the play-offs to qualify for two of the last three tournaments (including Thierry Henry's basketball trick against Ireland) and their utter humiliation during World Cup 2010 because, at one glance, the domestic product shows a grand malaise. Ligue 1 is dull. Pitches are generally atrocious, the level of football isn't competitive, television revenue reflects the downturn in the product, hooligan behaviour remains a serious problem (there's an annual €30million policing bill) and there is a panic about the quality of young players being brought through the ranks. Even beyond the normal 'here's a stick, let's beat the ref' nonsense, there's a wide consensus that the officials in France are sub-standard. The Government has introduced the infamous 75-per-cent tax law which will hurt many clubs; Monaco's response is to refuse to move from Monte Carlo into France and thus not pay tax at all. When Barcelona thrashed Lyon 5-2 back in 2009, the president of France's dominant club, Jean-Michel Aulas, warned that Ligue 1 was already in the relegation zone of Europe's second division and that Germany, Spain, England, even Italy, were pulling away. Leading the way: Didier Deschamps guided France to the World Cup via the play-offs . Since then, things have got markedly worse. Paris Saint-Germain are vastly wealthy, Monaco are the rich young upstarts - the rest are verging on cannon fodder. Lyon failed to qualify for the Champions League, Marseille didn't make the knock-outs, none of the other Ligue 1 clubs reached the last 32 of the Europa League. Internal critics queue up: 'The first criteria applied in evaluating a competition is the state of the pitches,' said Cyril Linette, sports director at Canal+. 'If you flick between the Premier League and ours, the difference is shocking. Rather than buying another player, clubs should be thinking about hiring some good gardeners.' Dull: The French division lacks the excitement of other major European leagues . Gerard Houllier: 'When I was France's . technical director, I sent (then manager) Raymond Domenech to Argentina . to see how they were doing things there. Down there, youngsters of the . same age are much hungrier than us. They're more mature, much tougher and are prepared to get a bit nasty on the pitch.' No matter their route to Brazil, there remains sufficient talent in Didier Deschamps' squad that, if the eversusceptible 'spirit' is buffed up, they remain a dark horse for the latter stages. The real fears are for what lies ahead, towards the sprawling and now decidedly odd 2016 tournament and beyond. Francois Blaquart, who thinks his country hasn't just fallen behind Spain, Portugal, Holland, Germany, Italy and Belgium but even Canada in youth development terms, is the man charged with curing France's ills. Back to basics: Technical director Francois Blaquart plans to rid France of its problem stars and produce loyal team players . He said: 'Club culture is a real problem - the strong identity that provides an anchor for young kids. 'Twenty years ago, Xavi was getting the metro every day to work on the same exercises and training techniques used today. Exactly the same! 'Even before that, Barca's coaches were instilling in him the club values. 'In France, players are like consumers in terms of relationships with their clubs, playing for six or seven years before they even get to a training centre and having no understanding of concepts like loyalty to the jersey. 'We will try to develop a less selfish footballer who plays with intelligence and creativity. 'We'd reached the point where the collective behaviour of our players had become a problem. They could handle the ball but, when it came to reading the game and playing in a team, there was a problem.' Bonne chance, Monsieur Blaquart.","Since winning the World Cup and Euro 2000 France have qualified for tournaments via the play-offs three times .

"By . Wills Robinson for MailOnline . Christina Fonthes, 27, from Manchester, was in the Democratic Republic of Congo with her mother and younger sister when her passport was taken away . A British woman was held captive in the Democratic Republic of Congo 'because her family want to cure her gayness', her friends have claimed. Christina Fonthes, 27, from Manchester travelled to the country's capital, Kinshasa, to visit her aunt with her mother and younger sister. But it is believed that shortly after arriving, the LGBT activist's mother took her passport away so her sexuality could be 'fixed'. In a tweet posted on Thursday, Miss Fonthes said: 'Pls tell @UKinDRC & @ukhomeoffice that Im  NOT missing. My passport has been stolen BY MUM. and I need to return to uk asap.' Her partner of three years, BBC sports presenter Jessica Creighton, also raised the alarm after she discovered the unfolding situation. She was told the news while covering the Youth Olympics in China and posted on Twitter that someone 'very dear' needed 'urgent help'. According to The Independent, Miss Fonthes, who works as a translator, reached the British Embassy to apply for emergency travel documents. However she couldn't stay there and was reportedly captured by police while travelling with her friend in a taxi. Following the ordeal, Miss Fonthes is heading back to the UK after what her girlfriend says has been an 'unbelievably tough few days'. Miss Creighton, who is travelling back to the UK, told the paper: 'It became apparent that her family were unhappy with her decision to be an out lesbian, they took her passport and [were] refusing to give it back. 'We have just found out Chris is now back with her family. Who knows what they might do?' An online petition was set up in a bid to bring her back and was signed by more than 500 people. Social media users also started a campaign to raise awareness of her situation. Same-sex activity is legal in the African, but couples regularly face prosecution under laws banning public indecency.

"By . Jenny Awford for MailOnline . A package containing £1,000 worth of cannabis arrived in the post at the exact moment police were searching a man's house for drugs, a court heard. Kyle Morgan, 23, from Lydney, Gloucestershire, was sentenced to a 12-month community order with 150 hours of unpaid work and ordered to pay £1,384. He had agreed to allow cannabis deliveries from abroad to his home on behalf of a man known only as 'Jake,' Gloucester Crown Court was told. Scroll down for video . A package containing cannabis arrived at Kyle Morgan's house on Queen Street (pictured) in Gloucestershire . Prosecutor David Scutt said UK Borders Agency intercepted a parcel addressed to Jake at Morgan's home on September 13 last year and found it contained 100 grams of cannabis. And when police went to the address in October with a search warrant they initially found a small amount of cannabis worth £8, but then a parcel arrived containing a far larger quantity. 'A parcel was delivered during the course of the search which was also addressed to Jake,' said Mr Scutt. 'In the parcel, police found 91.4g of cannabis valued at £914. A number of identical empty bags were found in the premises.' Kyle Morgan was sentenced to a 12-month community order at Gloucester Crown Court . Morgan, who had no previous criminal convictions, admitted two offences of evading the prohibition on the importation of illegal drugs. He said the small amount of cannabis was for his own use and the package was for a friend called Jake who had asked if he could have mail delivered there, according to Mr Scutt. Matthew Harbinson, defending, said Morgan committed the offences out of 'naivety'. He said Morgan had no connection or influence with others higher up the chain. 'He is a young man who is highly unlikely to be troubling the courts again,' said Mr Harbinson. Judge Hart said he was 'somewhat sceptical' about the truth of Morgan's explanation but it was not challenged by the prosecution and he therefore sentenced him on that basis. 'It is clear you are ashamed of yourself for having got into this position,' said the judge. He ordered the confiscation of £1,084 from Morgan under the Proceeds of Crime Act and ordered him to pay £200 costs.

"By . Jennifer Newton for MailOnline . Vicky Davies, pictured, from Ynysybwl, who made 160 needless calls to ambulance services in a bid to secure morphine . A woman who cost taxpayers £160,000 by making 160 needless calls to ambulances and health services to secure morphine has been banned from calling 999 for two years. Vicky Davies from Ynysybwl in Rhondda has been handed an Asbo to stop her 'shocking' behaviour and has been warned she faces prison if she calls the emergency services unless it is a genuine emergency. According to a report from Rhondda Cynon Taf council, the authority joined forces with the Welsh Ambulance Services NHS Trust and Cwm Taf Teaching Health Board to secure the Anti-Social Behaviour Order against Davies - who has no medical or psychological issues. Pontypridd Magistrates' Court was told the 43-year-old made more than 160 calls to emergency and non-emergency health services in the past two years - at an estimated cost to the health services of £1,000 a time. Once on board the ambulances, she attempted to secure morphine and entonox. Once her desire for the drugs was fulfilled, she walked out of hospital, the report stated. The court also heard that due to her aggressive, abusive and improper behaviour, the number of staff treating her had to be doubled. This, in turn, put further strain on services and took valuable resources away from genuine medical cases. The case against her was presented to the court by experts from the council's anti-social behaviour team, as well as specialist officers who deal with prolific offenders in the ambulance health service. The case for a full Asbo was considered on earlier this month,10 days after Davies was served an interim Asbo, banning her from calling 999 except in the case of a genuine emergency. In this 10-day period, she made a further 10 demands for emergency services, but did so via friends and family. She did not contest the order or the evidence presented and accepted the ASBO. She is now banned, until August 2016, from calling 999 or requesting an ambulance through another person unless in the case of a genuine emergency/life-threatening situation that requires an immediate response. Pontypridd Magistrates Court, pictured, heard that Davies was aggressive, abusive and displayed improper behaviour towards hospital staff . She is also banned from attending any accident and emergency department unless in the case of a genuine requirement or pre-arranged appointment and, having once done so, to remain in the hospital until discharged. She must not use a mobile phone or recording device while being treated by paramedics or doctors, the order continues, or while being transferred to hospital by ambulance, or request that she is treated with entonox or morphine. Paul Mee, of Rhondda Cynon Taf Council, said: 'Vicky Davies is a resident whose shocking behaviour had to be curbed for the sake of others who genuinely need emergency services. 'She has been told she will go straight to prison for any breaches.' Richard Lee, of the Welsh Ambulance Service, added: 'Davies' actions placed a great strain on the ambulance service in this community and prevented others from getting the medical attention they needed, so we hope this order will bring an end to her unreasonable behaviour.'","Vicky Davies made the calls  in order to secure morphine and entonox .

Yoko Ono's publicist is suing Eataly, celebrity chef Mario Batali's New York food emporium, claiming the bouncers at the popular Manhattan eatery shouted homophobic slurs at him and hurled him through a glass window.

"By . Jennifer Newton for MailOnline . Conservative MP Stephen Barclay, who says he has figures showing 39 doctors have removed themselves from the medical register rather than face a disciplinary hearing . Doctors who are accused of serious malpractice are taking early retirement so they can avoid going to disciplinary hearings, according to an MP. The claims come from Conservative MP Stephen Barclay, who says figures he has obtained show 39 doctors have removed themselves from the medical register in the past three years rather than face a disciplinary hearing. Voluntary erasure is usually granted to doctors who don't want to retain their UK registration due to retirement or moving abroad. However according to the Telegraph, Mr Barclay has figures showing that 39 doctors removed themselves from the register and those who had suffered due to medical incompetence were then suffering further 'injustice'. All bar seven of the names of the doctors have been released by the General Medical Council. However chief executive of the GMC Niall Dickson told the newspaper: 'There's no better way to protect the public than stopping them from practising as a doctor.' 'If at any time they then tried to get back on the register the case against them would become active again and where there are serious concerns realistically it is highly unlikely they could ever practise again.' According to his blog, Mr Barclay says he has been working with the General Medical Council in relation to disciplinary procedures for doctors and raised the issue in parliament. He wrote: 'I am keen to get this addressed following the death of Nikki Sams, whose case I have raised with the General Medical Council in the past. 'Nikki was just twenty-six when she died of cervical cancer in 2007, which her GP had not diagnosed after failing to spot the symptoms eight times. 'He escaped disciplinary action by retiring, despite having been investigated.' Earlier this month, the GMC also launched a new consultation which questions whether or not doctors across the UK should be required to say sorry if they have previously failed to do so.

"By . Neil Sears for the Daily Mail . Allowed to stay: Killer Jermaine Rutherford, 29, has avoided deportation to Jamaica by saying he would be in danger in the 'homophobic' country . A second Jamaican has escaped deportation at the last minute by claiming he is homosexual – despite being convicted of murdering a schoolboy. Jermaine Rutherford, 29, stabbed the 15-year-old to death over a £10 debt while in England on a temporary visa. He was due to be sent back to the Caribbean upon completing his prison sentence. But while awaiting deportation – ten years after a judge said he should be kicked out – Rutherford belatedly declared he was gay, and would be in danger in ‘homophobic’ Jamaica. The Home Secretary said his claim should be rejected ‘on credibility grounds’ – but the Court of Appeal ruled that he could stay in London. The Mail told yesterday how another Jamaican thug, Alvin Brissett, avoided deportation at the eleventh hour when he claimed to be a homo-sexual while sat in handcuffs at Gatwick airport. The father of two has won the right to remain here due to his human right to a ‘family life’ – despite a string of convictions for drugs possession, assault and robbery. The success of Rutherford is even more shocking, given his conviction was for murder. The full details of his case can only be revealed after the Daily Mail challenged a judge’s anonymity order. A woman claiming to be Rutherford’s ex-girlfriend says he ‘is not gay’, and even told her while he was behind bars that he planned to avoid deportation by claiming to be homosexual. Kay Carroll, 23, said: ‘He came out of prison a year and a bit ago and I’ve seen him quite recently. We were boyfriend and girlfriend. He’s not gay as far as I know. ‘He always made out as if he loved the girls – but I do remember when he was in prison he said something about planning he was going to say he was gay.’ The details of the killer’s victorious appeal emerged amid concern that the number of foreign criminals avoiding deportation rose by 50 per cent last year. The figures prompted the Conservatives to draw up plans to limit the role of the European Court of Human Rights in Britain. Rutherford won the right to stay in the UK at the Appeal Court in April, which ruled he could not be sent to Jamaica as he could face inhuman or degrading treatment for being gay. Three judges rejected an appeal from Home Secretary Theresa May, who had been fighting to send him back to the Caribbean ever since his release from jail in late 2012. Catherine Rowlands, acting for the Home Secretary, argued that ‘the claim of homosexuality was contrived and brought as a last resort to avoid deportation’. But the Court of Appeal heard ‘compelling’ evidence from Rutherford’s mother, who said she ‘knew all along’ that her son was gay, and that his ‘late disclosure’ was ‘prompted by societal attitudes, particularly that of Jamaicans towards gays’. Alvin Brissett, who has a string of convictions for drug possession, assault and robbery, avoided deportation to Jamaica after claiming at the 11th hour - while in handcuffs at Gatwick airport - that he was homosexual . Ruling in favour of Rutherford, Lord Justice Kay said: ‘This case turns on its specific and quite unusual facts. It should not be seen as providing more general succour to others convicted of grave crimes.’ The parents of Rutherford’s victim, Abdul Maye, were last night too upset to comment. Rutherford was 16 at the time of the crime, and had come to England from Jamaica on a temporary visa to visit his mother. He and a 14-year-old friend sold cannabis to Abdul, but when Abdul failed to pay up, the pair felt they had lost face. Armed with large knives, they attacked Abdul in front of his classmates at the school gates. They denied murder but were convicted at the Old Bailey. At the time, the trial judge said Rutherford had to be deported after leaving prison, saying: ‘You are a Jamaican national and within months of coming to this country you committed murder. I am of the view that your continued presence in this country will be detrimental to its citizens.’ No comment could be obtained from Rutherford, but he is understood to deny that Miss Carroll was ever his girlfriend.","Jermaine Rutherford, 29, stabbed boy, 15, while on temporary visa in the UK .

"By . Associated Press . A jury on Friday found a man guilty of murder after his pit bulls mauled a woman to death in a high desert town in California where residents said they carried rocks and guns for protection against packs of dogs. Alex Donald Jackson, 31, was convicted of second-degree murder and could get 24 years to life in prison at his sentencing scheduled for October 3. Jackson owned four pit bulls that mauled 63-year-old Pamela Devitt during her morning walk in Littlerock on May 9, 2013. Dog-owner: Alex Jackson was convicted of second-degree murder for the death of Pamela Devitt, who was mauled by four of his pit bulls . Devitt died from blood loss after being bitten 200 times, the coroner's office said. Gashes in her flesh were so deep that bone was exposed. Prosecutors argued that Jackson was not just negligent but also knew that his animals could endanger someone's life. They presented evidence that the dogs were involved in at least seven other altercations in the 18 months before the fatal attack. In Littlerock, an Antelope Valley town of about 1,400 people, residents told the Los Angeles Times that they were often cornered by packs of dogs. Some have forbid their children from playing outside and have taken to carrying sticks, rocks and guns for protection. Vincent Jackson said his brother Alex has accepted some responsibility in the case and wrote a letter to the victim's husband that was never sent. Still, Vincent Jackson thinks the murder charge is a knee-jerk reaction to the community's disdain for pit bulls. 'It feels like they're trying to make an example of him,' Vincent Jackson said about his brother. Defense attorney Al Kim echoed that sentiment, saying his client was taking the brunt of the rural area's growing frustration over abandoned animals. 'At some point, something needs to be done about these stray dogs, and I think an unfair amount of responsibility is being directed at my client,' Kim said before the verdict was returned. 'Does that mean he's a murderer? Absolutely not.' The National Canine Research Council estimates about 30 people are killed by dogs each year. Murder charges are rare because prosecutors must prove that the defendant knew the dogs were dangerous before the killing. In trial testimony, several horseback riders said they had been chased or bitten by Alex Jackson's dogs. Neighbors said the dogs jumped over a fence and made it difficult to retrieve mail. A mail carrier testified that he was unable to make a delivery to Alex Jackson's residence because of a threatening dog that eventually chased his vehicle for half a mile. Brutal death: Ben Devitt (right) holds a picture of his wife of 43 years, Pamela Devitt (left) who died of blood loss after being bitten 200 times by a pack of pit bulls while on a morning walk . Savage: Jackson's dogs had previously chased and bitten others in the months and years before Devitt's death . Jackson testified that he was unaware of most of the incidents. He said he would have gotten rid of the dogs if he thought they were capable of killing someone. At the time of his arrest, Jackson had eight dogs living at the home he shared with his mother. He had placed the four involved in the attack in his garage. 'I feel terrible about it. This isn't anything that I orchestrated or planned, that I wanted to have happen,' he said. Animal control officers testified that an inebriated Jackson told them shortly after the attack: 'If you mess with me, you're coming into the lions' den.' The victim's husband, Ben Devitt, said he wanted a guilty verdict to set a precedent and make people aware that their dogs can create a dangerous situation.","Alex Donald Jackson, 31, was found guilty of second-degree murder Friday .

"By . Lillian Radulova for Daily Mail Australia . An Australian man who came close to rescuing the 270 kidnapped Nigerian school girls from the terrorist group Boko Haram, has revealed information about the dangerous politics that dominate the area. Stephen Davis, who moved back to Perth from London last year, told the ABC he was only 15 minutes away from retrieving 60 of the kidnapped girls from rebel clutches after securing them through negotiations, when they were snatched by a second rebel group. The 63-year-old former Canon Emeritus at Coventry Cathedral in the UK who has extensive contacts with African terrorist groups, had been negotiating with Boko Haram commanders for some time before they agreed to release the girls. Scroll down for video . Perth resident Stephen Davis, 63, was 15 minutes away from rescuing 60 of the 270 kidnapped schoolgirls when the plan was sabotaged by another rebel group . The girls were taken in a raid on their school in Chibok, in Nigeria’s north-east, by the violent group who want to impose Sharia law on the country. Mr Davis was asked to come to Nigeria by the country's president for his hostage negotiation expertise after previously brokering a truce between violent rebels and the government in the Niger Delta in 2004, when he was working for the company Shell. 'I made a few phone calls to the Boko Haram commanders and they confirmed they were in possession of the girls,' Mr Davis told ABC's Radio National. 'They told me they'd be prepared to release some as a goodwill gesture towards a peace deal with the government, so I went to Nigeria on the basis of being able to secure their release.' The 270 girls are being held by Islamic group Boko Haram after they were abducted from Chibok, in north eastern Nigeria . This photo taken from the video by Nigeria's Boko Haram terrorist network on Monday, May 12, 2014, shows some of the missing girls . During the four month stint, Mr Davis had told Daily Mail Australia that he was 'encouraged by the progress' being made, saying 'This is a long process of building trust on both sides'. 'There are several groups to deal with as the girls are held in several camps. This makes any thought of a rescue highly improbable. To attempt to rescue one group would only endanger the others,' Mr Davis said. But he added: 'Every day there is the possibility of the release of the girls.' Upon negotiating strict conditions for the girls' release, Mr Davis revealed that the rescue mission was sabotaged by another group who hoped to cash in on the monetary reward being offered by Nigerian police for their retrieval. Terror leader Abubakar Shekau released a video of the kidnapped girls praying after their conversion to Islam . The Boko Haram leader has declared he would sell the girls into slavery, or marry them off to their kidnappers, if members of his sect were not released from prison . 'We travelled for four-and-a-half hours to reach them, but 15 minutes before we arrived they were kidnapped again by another group who wanted to cash in on a reward,' Mr Davis told the ABC.The girls ended up back with their original captors. However Mr Davis discovered that there was hope amongst the despair. He revealed that four of the kidnapped girls managed to successfully escape their captors and meet their families with the help of a young man who was formerly kidnapped by the same group. A mobile phone that had been hidden in the bra of one of the girls helped them contact their parents and receive directions to cross the border from Cameroon back to Nigeria. Deborah Peter told US congress members how Boko Haram killed her family in 2011 and called for the release of the kidnapped girls . Martha Mark holds up a photograph of her daughter Monica who is one of the girls kidnapped by Boko Haram . Mr Davis managed to smuggle footage of the escapees out of Nigeria in which they detail the torture they were subject to, including daily rape, the ABC revealed. But the devout Christian has shared that he does not believe the kidnappings will end through such negotiations. He has instead insisted that sponsors of the terrorist group –mainly Nigerian politicians – must cease.","Perth man Stephen Davis, came close to rescuing at least 60 of the 270 schoolgirls after months of negotiating with terror group Boko Haram .

"By . Jack Crone for MailOnline . These CCTV images appear innocent enough - a 'respectable looking' middle-aged couple stroll casually down a shopping aisle laden with a basket and baby pram. In fact, the pair pictured are serial shoplifters suspected of stealing thousands of pounds worth of cosmetics and electrical items using an empty pushchair. On each occasion captured by surveillance cameras, the woman enters the store and brazenly fills her basket with around £500 worth of items. Caught in the act: The couple pictured are wanted for a series of shoplifting offences in Plymouth and south Devon - the pair use an empty pram to hide their stolen goods . Her male accomplice then joins her a short time later and transfers the goods into his empty pram before leaving the store. Finally, the woman abandons the basket and walks out of the shop without making a purchase. The unlikely pair are being hunted by police, who believe they may be responsible for a series of high-value shoplifting offences in department stores in Plymouth and south Devon. Officers say the crimes date back over a year - with Dingles and Boots among the shops that have been hit. The white female suspect is thought to be in her late 30s to mid-40s, around 5ft 6in in height, with a slim build and dark hair worn in a pony tail. She also wears black and white glasses. Wanted: On each occasion the woman fills up a basket with around £500 worth of goods - the pram-pushing man then joins her and transfers the loot into his buggy before casually strolling out of the shop . The white male suspect is believed to be between 30 and 40 years old, approximately 5ft 6in to 5ft 7in in height, and bald with a chubby build. The pram he uses to conceal the stolen goods is dark, with orange detailing around the chair and hood. Police are now asking the public for help in identifying the pram-raiders - anyone with information should contact police on 101 quoting the reference CR/67065/14.","Couple are wanted for series of buggy thefts in Plymouth and south Devon .

"By . Mark Bryans, Press Association . West Ham have announced the signing of Barcelona midfielder Alex Song on a season-long loan. The 26-year-old Cameroon international struggled to hold down a regular place at the Nou Camp following a move from Arsenal in 2012 and returns to the Barclays Premier League with the Hammers - who paraded their new addition to fans ahead of the clash with Southampton. Clubs throughout Europe were put on alert when it emerged Song would be allowed to leave Barcelona - with West Ham having won the race to take him to Upton Park on a temporary basis despite reported interest from the likes of Napoli and Galatasaray. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Alex Song receive a heroes welcome at West Ham . New challenge: Alex Song has joined West Ham on a season-long loan deal from Barcelona . On board: The Cameroon international was unveiled before the game against Southampton at Upton Park . Song revealed it was a conversation with Hammers boss Sam Allardyce that led to his decision to move to east London and he is targeting European qualification. 'When I spoke to the manager, he gave me very good advice,' he told whufc.com. 'I had a very good chat with him and that's why I am coming here. We have to do better than last season. I think the club has very good ambition and I hope we can maybe catch the European positions, because that would be very good for the club. 'West Ham is looking to be a very, very big club in the future. The club has a great project and it is a very big project with very big ambition.

'I think it's great for the fans that the club wants to be one of the biggest in England. That's why I chose to come here. I always said that if I was to leave (Barcelona) one day I would return to the Premier League. 'It was a very hard decision when you have options of a lot of clubs who are playing in the Champions League, but at the end of the day I chose West Ham because I wanted to come to the Premier League.' Song, who won one Primera Division title during his spell in Spain, is likely to be West Ham's final summer signing - taking the total of new recruits to eight. Gunner: Alex Song is no stranger to the Premier League, having played for Arsenal between 2005 and 2012 . Carl Jenkinson has also joined on loan while Aaron Cresswell, Cheikhou Kouyate, Enner Valencia, Diafra Sakho, Diego Poyet and Mauro Zarate have been signed on permanent deals. Allardyce said he hoped to complete one more deal before Monday's transfer deadline and, with the acquisition of Song, it would be seen as a surprise if any other new faces came in. Song was sent off in Cameroon's 4-0 World Cup defeat to Croatia in his last competitive game and could make his debut in the Premier League trip to Hull after the international break, following in the footsteps of his cousin Rigobert Song, who turned out for the Hammers between 2000 and 2002. Although Allardyce also insisted he did not foresee anyone leaving, bringing in Song leaves doubts over the future of Mohamed Diame - who is wanted by QPR. Unwanted: Alex Song signed for Barcelona in  2012 for £15 million, but has failed to cement a first-team place . Experience: Song (right) would bring Premier League and Champions League experience to Upton Park . On his way: Song has failed to make an impression on new Barcelona coach Luis Enrique . QPR bound?

"By . Wills Robinson And Julian Robinson For Mailonline . Four more juveniles have been arrested following the death of a man found 'badly beaten' at his home. Detectives today named the man as 42-year-old Warren Free who was found unconscious when emergency crews arrived at his house in Spalding, Lincolnshire. A boy and girl aged 13 and another 15-year-old girl were arrested in connection with the murder inquiry. Emergency services were sent to Coronation Close in Spalding, Lincolnshire, after the 42-year-old man was found unconscious. Three children under the age of 15 have now been arrested for murder . Of those three juveniles already arrested, one girl has been released on police bail and the other boy and girl remain in custody being interviewed. A further four juvenile boys have now been arrested in connection with the murder inquiry. Mr Free was airlifted to Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre on Thursday, but died in the early hours of Friday morning. There continues to be a significant police presence in the Coronation Close area of Spalding, where Mr Free had lived with his 12-year-old son. A neighbour suggested yesterday that Mr Free's son was at home when he was attacked. Gena Probert, 85, who lived next door, said: 'It is a terrible thing to happen. I only knew him as Warren and he was a sweet man and wouldn't hurt a fly. 'I was woken up by the sound of someone running down the street at about 1am in the morning but didn't think too much of it until I saw police and ambulance at Warren's house the next day. 'I saw him being dragged out on a stretcher with a blanket over him, he was absolutely covered in blood. I couldn't even make out his face, he was that badly beaten. 'The air ambulance came down in the skate park but there were delays in it taking off because the paramedics couldn't get him stable. 'The police came to see me and said a girl and a boy aged 13 were suspected of breaking into his house and another 15-year-old was also arrested. 'He used to . come round and have a coffee or a can of coke and sit and chat to me. He . would often take my bins out of get me a pint of milk or paper from the . shop if I couldn't go out. 'I . feel awful about what has happened. This is a very close-knit community . and we look out for each other. I will miss Warren terribly.' The victim was airlifted to Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham but died in the early hours of this morning . An elderly neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: 'Warren had a 12-year-old son and a daughter that lives in Wales. She was about 20.' It is understood that his mother and father moved to Portugal a few months ago. 'He didn't work. What he told us a long time ago was that he was beaten badly in Wales and that's the reason why he moved here.' Another neighbour added: 'He kept himself to himself. I spoke to him but that's about all. 'He used to walk past with his son. I spoke to him one time where he said he came from Reading, moved to Wales, and then came here. He was a friendly chap. 'The police asked us to look after the son (on Thursday) while they tried to find him somewhere to stay. 'He stopped here with us for a couple of hours. He must be 12 or 13. 'Warren's parents live in Portugal but I saw them when they came to visit Warren.' Detectives from the East Midlands Special Operations Unit, Major Crime Branch, are leading the murder inquiry and officers are carrying out door-to-door inquiries in Coronation Close. Inspector Jim Tyner, community policing inspector for Spalding, said: 'Coronation Close is a close-knit community and I know many will be affected by what has happened. 'My officers will be carrying out extra patrols in the area and I would urge residents to approach them with any concerns.' Senior Investigating Officer, DCI Martin Holvey, of the East Midlands Special Operations Unit, added last night: 'We are continuing to investigate the circumstances in which Mr Free sustained the injuries that led to his subsequent death and I am appealing to anyone with information that may assist the enquiry to contact the major incident room by calling 101 and quoting incident 161 of 28th August.' An East Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said: 'A fast response vehicle was first on the scene and requested immediate back-up from a double-crewed ambulance and Helimed. 'The air ambulance arrived with a doctor on board and flew the patient to Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham.'

Adios: Chelsea striker Fernando Torres has agreed a permanent move to AC Milan on a two-year deal . The 27-year-old is believed to want wages of £80,000-per-week. Torres' departure leaves Mourinho with just Diego Costa and Didier Drogba as recognised senior strikers. Chelsea first made contact with Remy's agent when they feared Drogba was injured earlier this month. Chelsea have contacted QPR about the striker's availability on either a loan or permanent deal. The former Marseille man's versatility means that he could operate as a central striker or wide in a front three. Remy has made it clear that he wants to leave Loftus Road for a team playing in Europe's elite competition and it is believed the French international would jump at the chance to move to Stamford Bridge.

"By . Darren Boyle for MailOnline . An estimated 200 African immigrants tried to climb over a razor wire fence and claim asylum a Spanish enclave of Melilla in northern Morocco. Spain claims sovereignty over two areas of Morocco which they treat as Spanish national territory. As a result, both areas are very popular with migrants looking to make their way to the European Union as they do not have to attempt a perilous sea crossing to the Spanish mainland. African migrants sit on top of the razor wire fence waiting to make a break into EU territory in Melilla . The migrants try and stretch the defenders using force of numbers to make their way into Melilla . Melilla is one of two enclaves in northern Morocco which Madrid regard as Spanish national territory . Over the past 24 hours, more than 200 immigrants tried to climb across the razor wire fence protecting Melilla. Only ten managed to pass the formidable barrier and make it into Spanish territory. Spanish Civil Guard officers also try to prevent the migrants from reaching EU territory. The ten successful immigrants have been taken to a short-term holding centre where a decision will be made about their future. During the first half of 2014, 75,000 people have tried to cross the Mediterranean from North Africa trying to land in Italy, Greece, Spain and Malta. More than 1,000 people have drowned attempting to cross by sea - even though the sea is just nine miles wide at its narrowest point. In recent years, Spanish authorities have increased the security of Melilla and its second enclave of Ceuta. These men successfully made it across the border and are awaiting a decision on whether they can remain . The migrants attempt to cross the border without any personal belongings - many do not even have shoes .","More than 200 African immigrants attempt to cross into Spanish territory .

"By . Cindy Tran for Daily Mail Australia . An enthusiastic amateur photographer said he has spent many restless nights and early hours of the mornings - all rugged up with a camera ready on a tripod to do what he loves most - capturing the perfect moments in Canberra ACT. John Hunt said the best times for taking great photographs is early in the morning when everyone is asleep to catch that perfect sunrise. The 57-year-old said his favourite place to shoot his camera is around Lake Burley Griffin, either from land or in his kayak. ‘I love the lake when it's early in the morning because the water is still and there’s no wind,' he said. John Hunt said his favourite place to shoot his camera is around Lake Burley Griffin, either from land or in his kayak at sunset and sunrise . ‘I’ve managed to capture the beautiful mirrored reflection of the lake a few times and it’s been worth getting up early for. 'There are a few monuments around Canberra and I think the most photogenic feature is the Carillon, especially when it is lit up at night. 'I also love taking pictures at night, especially during winter time when it’s dark around 6pm and I’m walking home from work.’ Mr Hunt, who lives in Canberra, purchased his first DSLR camera before he went on a family trip to Europe and China in 2008 but admitted he had no clue how to use it. It was two years ago when he took a professional photography course and not long after, found his love and passion for photography. 'I have been developing my photography skills over the last two and a half years and finally printed one of my own photos to hang on our loungeroom wall,' he said. 'I am really happy with this image of my hometown Canberra and it was taken early this month at the Lake Burley Griffin on a cold gloomy afternoon. 'All rugged up, camera on a tripod, I stood and waited for the perfect moment when the sun radiated it's brilliant red on the clouds.' Mr Hunt said the camera can't always catch what his eyes see in reality so he goes through some editing process. 'For instance, when I take a picture in the sun, it might either be too dark from the shadow or too bright, so I edit the photos to allow others see what I see. 'People say it's cheating but I think it's not. I'm editing my photos the way I want the world to see through my eyes.' When asked what his other styles of photography interests him, Mr Hunt said he is currently learning portrait photography, as well as taking photographs of family events. ‘My son got married in May this year and I took my camera to his wedding to take some photographs and everyone told me I did a good job.' Mr Hunt said he will be going on a holiday with his wife Joanne to South Island, New Zealand at the end of September. 'I'm really excited about it and I cannot want to take my camera over there to take beautiful pictures of where we'll be staying,' he said. Despite all his beautiful photography work, Mr Hunt owned a plumbing business for 25 years and he's onto his 40th year as a plumber. He also teaches plumbing at the Canberra Institute of Technology. Mr Hunt lives in Canberra with his wife Joanne and they have two sons - Tom, 30 and Steven 28. 'Canberra is a big country town and I think it's a great place to raise children,' he said. In June 2014, Canberra was voted as Australia's most 'liveable city'. It scored 10-out-of-10 for Safety, Income and Civic Engagement. Canberra's total score was 77.7 out of a possible 80.

"By . Tamara Cohen For Daily Mail . Eric Pickles, Local Government Secretary, proposes residents could get right to change yellow lines . Residents could get the right to challenge yellow lines on their roads, under proposals to be announced by Eric Pickles today. He is suggesting that if at least 50 members of the public or local businesses, or up to 10 per cent of people in an area, are against yellow lines in their neighbourhood, then they should be able to petition for a formal review. The Local Government Secretary, who is known to be against ‘over-zealous’ parking policies, said he hoped local authorities would comply or he would force them to do so by law. Mr Pickles said the right to review would also apply to ‘unfair parking charges’ or any other aspect of parking policy, which is having a negative impact on an area. He has blamed expensive and restrictive parking policies for the decline of small shops in town centres. ‘Too often, yellow lines are imposed on neighbourhoods or the high street, without fair consideration of the livelihood of residents, local shops or the availability of parking spaces,’ Mr Pickles said. He added: ‘Now local people will have a direct and democratic right to trigger a formal council-led review of road restrictions. ‘Incessant yellow lines, CCTV spy cars and trigger-happy parking wardens make everyday life unbearable for drivers looking for somewhere to park when shopping locally.’ The right to a petition will apply from January next year if a review of parking guidelines, which will be taking evidence until October, backs the idea. Last year Mr Pickles tried to legislate to allow people to park on double yellow lines for up to 15 minutes, saying they might want to pop in to the shops for a loaf of bread and should not be penalised. But he was forced to drop the idea in June after a consultation concluded it would be confusing. Road safety groups said it could be dangerous. He has managed to ban CCTV ‘spy cars’ from enforcing on-street parking rules. The Local Government Association is against Mr Pickles’ latest proposals. A spokesman said: ‘Councils already listen carefully to their residents, road users and businesses, consulting widely on parking schemes. ‘Central government meddling will simply make achieving balanced and sensible outcomes much harder. ‘The Government recently did a U-turn and dropped its plans to allow “grace periods” on double yellow lines. We sincerely hope this announcement follows the same route.’ He suggests that if at least 50 members of the public or local businesses, or up to 10 per cent of people in an area, are against yellow lines in their neighbourhood, then they should be able to petition for a formal review .","Eric Pickles said right to review would apply to 'unfair parking charges'

"By . Sally Lee for Daily Mail Australia . Love it or hate it, Vegemite is the iconic spread that has been an essential part of Australia's heritage dating back to the 1920s. But 10 American kids were not too fond of the dark brown food paste made from yeast extract and vegetables. And looks can be deceiving, as some initially reacted with excitement as they thought the bowl of Vegemite was chocolate pudding and questioned whether this was Australia's version of Nutella, a sweet Italian hazelnut spread. Others were more sceptical, describing it as 'poop'. Krischelle is one of 10 American kids who tried Vegemite for the first time in the YouTube video 'Kids vs Food' The much-loved iconic Australian spread has been around since the 1920s . The children appeared in a YouTube video done by the REACT channel . Krischelle, one of the kids filmed for the REACT Channel YouTube video entitled 'Kids Vs. Food', held her nose and gasped in horror as a scoop of the paste was presented on a silver platter. She was convinced the dark consistency of Vegemite was akin to 'poop' while most were hopeful and thought it was some sort of chocolate pudding - albeit clearly confused by its appearance. 'I've had chocolate but not this gross icky stuff,' Maxim said. Olivia described the bowl of Vegemite as 'Nutella that's weird'. Upon smelling it, she wasn't too convinced. 'It doesn't smell like Nutella, it smells like fish,' she said. Lucas (left) and Samirah (right) take their first bite of Vegemite with crackers . Both Olivia (left) and Lyndon (right) weren't impressed with the salty and bitter taste of the dark paste . Others had a more interesting perception of the spread as they thought it was seaweed, soy sauce, teriyaki sauce or bread. The dish of the day was Vegemite on crackers as all 10 kids squirmed as they took their first bite. 'That has a bad after-taste,' Jayka said. While Lucas was a little off his mark when the mystery meal was plated up. 'Cookies!' he exclaimed. None of the kids who tried the spread made from yeast extract would recommend eating it . So far, it has attracted more than 600,000 views on YouTube . But the salty and bitter taste did not impress any of the children, . 'It's weird, acidy and makes you want to barf,' Lyndon said. Olivia gave her critical review on the paste. 'It tastes like someone tried to make food and failed horribly,' she said. When the name of the spread was revealed, most had never heard of Vegemite. One thought it was 'like vegetables that tastes like termites'.

"By . Associated Press . State lawmakers on Thursday passed a bill that would make California the first state to define when 'yes means yes' while investigating sexual assaults on college campuses. The Senate unanimously passed SB967 as states and universities across the U.S. are under pressure to change how they handle rape allegations. The bill now goes to Governor Jerry Brown, who has not indicated his stance on the bill. Senator Kevin de Leon, of Los Angeles, said his bill would begin a paradigm shift in how California campuses prevent and investigate sexual assault. Rather than using the refrain 'no means no', the definition of consent under the bill requires 'an affirmative, conscious and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity'. Earlier versions of the bill had similar language. Scroll down for video . Victory: State Senator Kevin de Leon is pictured urging lawmakers to approve his measure to make California the first state to use the 'yes means yes' definition while investigating sexual assaults on college campuses . 'With this measure, we will lead the nation in bringing standards and protocols across the board so we can create an environment that's healthy, that's conducive for all students, not just for women, but for young men as well too, so young men can develop healthy patterns and boundaries as they age with the opposite sex,' de Leon said before the vote. Silence or lack of resistance does not constitute consent. The legislation says it's also not consent if the person is drunk, drugged, unconscious or asleep. Lawmakers say consent can be nonverbal, and universities with similar policies have outlined examples as maybe a nod of the head or moving in closer to the person. Advocates for victims of sexual assault supported the change as one that will provide consistency across campuses and challenge the notion that victims must have resisted assault in order to have valid complaints. Some critics say the legislation is overreaching and sends universities into murky, unfamiliar legal waters. Speaking out: Handmade signs decrying rape decorate tents set at an evening to raise awareness of sexual assault at Occidental College in Los Angeles, which is one of the colleges affected by the bill . Gordon Finley, an adviser to the National Coalition for Men, wrote an editorial asking Brown not to sign the bill. He argued that 'this campus rape crusade bill' presumes the guilt of the accused. 'This is nice for the accusers — both false accusers as well as true accusers — but what about the due process rights of the accused,' Finley wrote. The bill passed the state Assembly on Monday by a 52-16 vote. Some Republicans in that house questioned if statewide legislation is an appropriate venue to define consent. There was no opposition from Senate Republicans. 'This bill is very simple; it just requires colleges to adopt policies concerning sexual assault, domestic violence, gang violence and stalking,' said Sen. Anthony Cannella, R-Ceres. 'They should have already been doing that.' The bill would apply to all California post-secondary schools, public and private, that receive state money for student financial aid. The California State University and University of California systems are backing the legislation after adopting similar consent standards this year. The bill also requires colleges and universities to adopt 'victim-centered' sexual-assault response policies and implement comprehensive programs to prevent assault. In January, President Barack Obama vowed to make the issue a priority. He announced a task force that created a website providing tips for filing complaints, www.notalone.gov, and issued a report in May naming 55 colleges and universities across the country facing investigation for their responses to sexual abuse and violence. The University of California, Berkeley was included on the list.","Senate unanimously passed bill that defines consent as 'an affirmative, conscious and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity'

"By . Jill Reilly . A royal blue lobster has been saved from the boiling pot thanks to his rare colouring. Steve Harrison, from Aberdaron, was sorting through his catch when he spotted a lobster with a royal blue shell among the other regular lobsters in the pot. It was a unusual discovery - only one in two million lobsters can have a mutation that allows them to have a blue outer shell. A royal blue lobster has been saved from the boiling pot due to his unusual colouring . Mr Harrison, who has fished on the Llyn Peninsula, Gwynedd, for 32 years, said: 'I'd caught blue ones before but never one so blue' Mr Harrison, who has fished on the Llyn Peninsula, Gwynedd, for 32 years, said: 'I noticed a flash of blue when I pulled the lobster pots up and as I looked in I saw it was a blue lobster. 'I’d caught blue ones before but never one so blue. 'It’s not often you see blue lobsters and even this one’s antenna was blue so it was a very rare catch. 'I was going to sell it but re-considered as I thought it was too rare to just give away so I decided to keep it in the tank in our fish and chip shop in Aberdaron. 'Its colour has faded slightly since it’s been in the tank but it’s very popular, a lot of people come in just to see it!' Normally appearing brown or dark green in nature prior to boiling, scientists . say just one lobster in two million is blue - the result of a genetic . defect that causes them to produce an excessive amount of protein. The blue lobster is no different to a regular lobster - it is only the mutation which influences the lobsters . outer shell colour. Ordinary: Prior to being cooked and turning red, most lobsters are found in browns and dark greens, as seen in this file photo of them removed from a cage at sea . Scientists say just one lobster in two million is blue - the result of a genetic defect that causes them to produce an excessive amount of protein. The blue lobster is no different from the regular lobster-  it’s only the mutation which influences the lobsters outer shell colour. They can be found any place where regular lobsters are found. A research study conducted by Professor Ronald Christensen, at the University of Connecticut, USA, found that excessive levels of a protein combines with a red caratenoid molecule known as astaxanthin, forming a blue complex known as crustacyanin.  It is this that makes the lobster blue. In 2006 lobsterman David Percy caught a yellow lobster near Whaleback Island in the US at the mouth of the Kennebec River. The odds of finding a yellow lobster are approximately 1 in 30 million. It is estimated that only about one in 100 million lobsters are albino - lacking in coloured pigments. They are known as 'white' or 'crystal' lobsters. They can be found any place where regular lobsters are found. In 2008 a rare blue lobster was found off the Isle of Man and in 2012 another fisherman caught one off the coast of Nova Scotia. According to researchers at . the University of Maine Lobster Institute lobsters have been found in . even more rare colours than blue. According to the Gulf of Maine Research Institute, one-out-of-10 million lobsters are found in a bright red colour. Even . rarer, however, are yellow and calico lobsters - speckled with yellows . and oranges - which both have an estimated one-in-30 million chance of . finding. Mr Harrison said he is now planning to release it back into the ocean at the end of the summer. The blue lobster was not the only spectacular catch Mr Harrison has made in the last month. He also caught a monster lobster, weighing in a whopping nine pounds. 'The big lobster weighed in around nine pounds, its claws were huge and it’s definitely the biggest one I’ve seen in a while. 'I . wasn’t too sure what to do with it but then I was contacted by the . School of Ocean Sciences at Bangor University who have now tagged it and . it’s been released back into the ocean,' added Mr Harrison.","Steve Harrison caught the lobster on the Llyn Peninsula, Gwynedd, Wales .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Rising star of the Labour party Chuka Umunna has shrugged off a vile online race-hate campaign against him - because he is 'used to it'. The shadow business secretary was attacked as a 'spear chucker' and a 'cave man' after Ukip supporters reacted angrily to his suggestion that many of them lacked basic internet skills . Mr Umunna said 'a lot' of Ukip supporters were 'disconnected' from the internet and could not do basic things like sending emails or browsing the internet. Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna has been subjected to vile online racist abuse after appearing on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday . Following his remarks, which Mr Umunna's aides said had been 'wilfully misconstrued', he was targetted by a Ukip email campaign to 'help him understand' why they supported Mr Farage. But the campaign was hijacked by racists, who bombarded the MP for Streatham with abuse on a Facebook site. One person wrote: 'Maybe he uses drums to communicate perhaps.' Another said: 'This guy calls himself Chukka 'Spear' Umunna.' One said: 'I say he needs immediate deportation from Britain back to whatever 3rd world hellhole he crawles out of.' 'That's rich coming from a cave man,' said another. A source close to Mr Umunna admitted the abuse was 'nasty' but revealed the shadow cabinet minister was no longer surprised by it. He said: 'We are used to getting a lot of racist abuse from UKIP supporters. So it's not that new. But it is fairly shocking, some of that stuff - it is appalling. It speaks for itself. 'A lot of that stuff is quite nasty and shocking. It's certainly notable how there's a lot of nasty stuff out there. It's something he gets quite a bit of on Twitter. It is very nasty.' The abuse was sparked after Mr Umunna appeared on BBC One’s Andrew Marr show on Sunday. He said the BBC had carried out 'some very interesting research' on people being unable to use the internet. Mr Umunna said: 'One in five people in our economy cannot do the full basics online of sending and receiving an email, browsing the internet, filling in an online form. 'There has been a lot of talk of communities that have been disconnected from our global economy, and those of course were a lot of those voting for Ukip in the local and European elections.' He added: 'Of that mass of people who can’t do the things that all of us take for granted, a very large number of them are from those communities.' Mr Umunna is a close ally of Ed Miliband but has been tipped as a future Labour leader following a rapid rise since becoming an MP in 2010 . Mr Umunna said the next Labour Government would be 'absolutely focused on connecting people into the global economy so they can realise their dreams and aspirations'. The shadow business secretary's remarks appeared to echo similar claims by Ukip's own communities spokeswoman Suzanne Evans in the wake of the European elections last month, when the party failed to breakthrough in London. Following the local elections Mrs Evans blamed the capital's 'more media-savvy and educated' population for the party’s lack of support in London.","Chuka Umunna targeted by online racists who label him 'cave man'

"By . Ian Drury . and James Slack . The staggering scale of abuse of the student visa system by immigrants desperate to stay in Britain was revealed yesterday. Tens of thousands of bogus students faked English language tests to beat UK border controls, the Government admitted. An . estimated 48,000 immigrants had exploited the lax system in a . ‘shocking’ scam run by criminal gangs, said Immigration Minister James . Brokenshire. Immigration . minister James Brokenshire said English language tests were being . cheated to allow foreign students to stay in Britain . He . revealed there had been ‘systematic cheating’ that allowed foreigners . who could barely speak a word of English to stay in the country . illegally, with corrupt invigilators reading out answers or allowing . gangs of imposters to sit tests so the candidates could be awarded an . English language certificate. The National Crime Agency has been called in to assist the investigation and some arrests have already been made. It is the latest immigration scandal to rock the Home Office. Last month the Mail revealed migrants who cannot speak English were . able to buy a certificate saying they had passed a language test. The document opens the door to British citizenship, allowing them access to a full range of benefits. Our investigation exposed Learn Pass Succeed, which ran the scam at exam centres licensed by the Home Office. During our undercover probe, . the Mail paid £500 for a pass certificate in the English language exam . for a fake candidate despite him never sitting the test or taking a . course. Speaking in the . Commons yesterday, Mr Brokenshire said immigration officials were . working with HM Revenue & Customs to identify foreign students who . are in Britain unlawfully as a result of taking the fake language tests, . so they can be booted out. He revealed there had been 'systematic cheating' that allowed foreigners who could barely speak a word of English to stay in the country illegally . In . one extraordinary case, an overseas university student earned more than . £20,000 a year despite rules preventing them from working more than 20 . hours a week during term time. Ministers . also said there were ‘serious concerns’ surrounding the colleges and . universities which had allowed the overseas students to enrol on . courses. The Home Office was alerted to the student visa scandal only after it was exposed by a BBC Panorama programme in February. ETS, the major company that sets the exams but does not appoint the invigilators, is now at the centre of a police probe. In . a humiliating Commons appearance, Mr Brokenshire said an investigation . had found more than 29,000 falsified test certificates and another . 19,000 questionable results. But he was forced to admit: ‘It is likely . that the true totals will be higher.’ He . added: ‘Evidently this could only happen with considerable collusion by . the test centres concerned. The Government is not prepared to tolerate . this abuse. ‘We will not . hesitate to take firm action against those students, colleges and . universities  who do not abide by their legal responsibilities, and . bring those responsible to justice.’ Each . year, around 100,000 non-EU students get their visas to stay in the UK . extended. Since 2011 foreign students have had to prove they can speak . English. Glyndwr University . in north-east Wales, has been stripped of its right to admit foreign . students after up to 350 were identified as having invalid or dubious . test results. In addition, . 57 private further education colleges also had licenses for admitting . foreign students suspended. The University of Bedfordshire and . University of West London are no longer allowed to recruit overseas . students pending inquiries. Mr . Brokenshire said the ‘worst abuse’ took place at the campuses of London . universities which were located in other parts of the country. He has . ordered a separate inquiry by the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher . Education, a university watchdog. In . 2012, academics expressed concerns that universities were recruiting . foreign students whose grasp of English is so poor they would ‘struggle . to scrape a GCSE’. Foreign students were seen as ‘cash cows’ as they . could be charged up to £20,000 in fees. Shadow . immigration minister David Hanson said the scale of the scandal was . ‘truly shocking’. He added: ‘People will be outraged that genuine . students who can add to our economy are being turned away while bogus . students prosper under this Government. It is clearly an abuse that . damages the integrity of the system.’ The . Tories said Labour had done nothing to tighten up immigration controls . during its time in power and it had ‘fallen on this Government to . introduce further stringent measures’. Ministers have no idea how many sham marriages are conducted in Britain, the Government's borders chief told MPs today. Sir John Vine, the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, said there were likely to be many more fake weddings than the 10,000 estimated by the Home Office. He told the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee that the problem was 'much more widespread' than ministers admitted. Former chief constable Sir John Vine told MPs the Home Office did not know how many people were abusing the immigration system by carrying out sham marriages . Sir John said Nigerians, Ghanaians and Pakistanis were most likely to be caught trying to cheat their way past border controls by conducting a fake wedding. But he added: 'One of the fundamental problems is that the Home Office doesn't really know. 'There's a combination of a lack of intelligence and also of poor management information in order for the Home Office to get a grip on it.' He was asked whether he thought there were many more sham marriages than officially recorded. Sir John said: 'I think so.' He added: 'It is a much more widespread issue than the figures suggest.' He said some couples turned up for their ceremony in casual clothes and stood texting on their mobile phones throughout the service.","James Brokenshire said fake foreign students abused system to stay in UK .

"By . Lord Saatchi . Tomorrow is only the beginning. At 3pm in the House of Lords I will introduce the Medical Innovation Bill 2012. It will take 30 seconds, no more, but it will set in motion an important process. For this is truly a matter of life and death. The aim, in practical terms, is to change the way we treat patients, many of them terminally ill. The Bill's ultimate goal is to help find a cure for cancer. I confess to a personal interest. On December 17, 2009, my wife, the novelist Josephine Hart, was diagnosed with primary peritoneal cancer. It was at the hospital, at 5.32pm, that Josephine was told the news. Legacy: Lord Saatchi with his wife Josephine Hart before she died last year from cancer . She uttered three words. Malignant. Advanced. Inoperable. We didn't know then that it was terminal. There is always hope. Until there isn't. And, as we discovered, there is precious little cause for optimism in the cancer ward. It is a place of fear and uncertainty and medieval treatments that are degrading and ineffective. I have witnessed scenes there that would not be permitted in a Hollywood horror movie. Josephine died on June 2, 2011. Since then I have felt a gnawing, numbing, grief. I always will. Sot say this Bill with Josephine or my love of Josephine would be ridiculous. I wouldn't know about any of this if it weren't for her and what happened. But let me make clear: there is no real connection. This Bill stands alone. I want to make a valid, worthwhile contribution, to put all that I have learnt to good use, and I realise that's not necessarily helped by being the relative of the deceased. It's worth remembering the people who have helped with the drafting of this Bill have no connection at all. My team has spent a year researching this and we've consulted some of the top medical minds in the country. We also have their backing. The Bill itself has been drafted by one of the top parliamentary counsels, the person who is managing the legislative process is the former Clerk of the House of Lords. Their motive is not bereavement, it is to encourage people to find a cure for cancer. That's exactly how I feel. I am a rational person confronted with a conundrum. Which is, how is it possible that there's been so much technological advance in so many spheres but not in cancer? Certainly not in the type of women's cancers that Josephine suffered. And I've found one explanation. It is this. In English law there is only one test in cases of medical negligence. If a doctor is accused of failing to provide the proper care, a panel of expert witnesses is called to determine whether they would have acted in the same way. It stands to reason therefore that you are more likely to be found guilty of medical negligence if you depart from standard procedure. Your livelihood and reputation are at risk if you deviate from the status quo. This, the, is a key barrier to progress. Innovation is deviation by definition. This Bill will change the law in a very specific way by setting out a procedure that doctors can follow if they want to try a new and different treatment. According to Professor Alan Ashworth, chief executive at The Institute of Cancer Research, thanks to research into the cancer genome we are now on the brink of being able to provide much less toxic therapies. Doctors know how to use them in a small subsection of a few cancers such as blood and lung cancers but they should be given more freedom to utilise them in an experimental setting. This Bill sets out the framework for that. How is it that we are still relying on chemotherapy, radiotherapy and invasive surgery when none of them guarantee a certain outcome? Worse, they often do more harm than good. Most people think the terrible thing about cancer treatment is the hair loss. Hair loss, particularly for a woman, is a terrible thing, but the side effects of the drugs are much more horrific than that. They create the same symptoms as the disease - nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting and fatigue. Change: Tory peer Lord Saatchi wants to amend the law to make it easier for doctors to try new treatments for cancer . A further effect of the drugs is to damage the immune system, which opens a path to fatal infection. So a person is as likely to die from the treatment as from the cancer itself. With this Bill, doctors may try new methods, confident that they have a legal framework to work within. I realise there will be objections. Nobody's going to change the law without objections. Firstly, I expect the Government will say it's otiose, a term much used in Parliament, which means unnecessary. In other words this Bill will bring no benefit, they are already doing a marvellous job, tremendous new funds are being given to cancer research and people are working day and night on a cure. I don't think that's a serious objection because I don't think anyone who has any experience of cancer would agree that everything's going terribly well at all. The second objection is much more important, and it's that this Bill is dangerous. It's a license for recklessness and will allow quacks and snake oil merchants to practise experiments on patients and put lives at risk. In fact, the opposite is true. A correct process, set out in law, will deter illogical or unreasonable departure from standard practice. A great deal of our research has focused on finding that balance between innovation and recklessness. And we need that innovation. While the medical profession has made great inroads in some diseases, in others, such as pancreatic or ovarian cancer, there has been very little advance in rates of survival. According to the experts, the cure for cancer, like the discovery of penicillin or insulin, will come from a man or a woman who has an idea. And it is going to happen one day. But if it is to work they need to test that idea and prove that it's true. This Bill is going to help encourage that person. So there is my motivation. True, my personal sorrow knows no bounds. Conventional thinking tells us to 'move on' after death. I disagree. That would be a monstrous act of betrayal. Josephine is me, I am her, we are one. Death cannot change that. My wife said poetry saved her life. Its essential truths have rescued me too. In a poem by Robert Frost, Out, Out, a boy's arm is cut off in the sawmill. As he bleeds to death his workmates, 'since they were not the one dead, turned to their affairs.' Josephine said that was the most brutal line in all of English literature. I will not be the one to turn away. If this Bil can help even one person, a mother, daughter, father, son, I will be happy. But ultimately, one day, I hope it will help find a cure. It will be a fitting legacy.","Still suffers 'gnawing, numbing grief' of losing his wife Josephine Hart .

"Years of scientific work could be undone at AstraZeneca if a deal goes ahead with Pfizer, experts at the firm have warned. Any takeover would be ‘disruptive’ for its pipeline of new drugs, they said, calling on the board to ‘fight’ for the company’s independence. The comments are in contrast to those of chief executive Pascal Soriot, who stands to make up to £31.5million if the deal goes ahead. Expert: Concerns have been raised by Dr Mene Pangalos (pictured), AstraZeneca's executive vice chairman for innovative medicines and early development . He has refused to rule out a deal on the grounds that the interests of shareholders must be taken  into account. Concerns have been raised by Dr Mene Pangalos, AstraZeneca’s executive vice chairman for innovative medicines and early development. He said the firm had spent years developing trust in an industry that relies on close collaboration between scientists in a variety of fields and organisations. ‘It’s quite fragile because it’s all dependent on people,’ he said. ‘If you destabilise that, it could have a hugely detrimental impact on science in the UK.’ The company was confident it could keep delivering lucrative drugs and other treatments without outside intervention, he added. Describing its ethos as ‘innovative and collaborative’, he said: ‘That is our culture. That is what I am fighting to retain.’ Dr Mike Snowden, head of discovery science, warned a merger could lead to job losses or the closure of facilities. And Dr Jane Osbourn, vice president of MedImmune, the firm’s biologics arm, insisted ‘continuity is crucial’ for the long-term commitments vital to life sciences, where a single discovery can take decades of research. ‘Big mergers are disruptive. That’s an important point to put,’ she said. The merger between Pfizer and AstraZeneca would be the largest in UK corporate history creating a £63billion business. Takeover: The comments are in contrast to those of AstraZeneca's chief executive Pascal Soriot (pictured), who stands to make up to £31.5million if the deal goes ahead . The US firm has sought to calm fears about the impact on the pharmaceutical industry in the UK with pledges about its commitment. But it  has admitted there could be job losses through ‘financial synergies’. Mr Soriot has 152,000 shares in his firm, worth £8.3million. Another 421,000 shares in a long-term incentive scheme would increase the total to £31.5million. Together with shares held by senior directors, the board’s windfall would reach £60million.In an interview with the Daily Mail on Thursday Mr Soriot insisted a deal was ‘not inevitable’. He said yesterday: ‘We have complete confidence in our strategy as an independent company and remain focused on delivering new medicines for patients.’ Meanwhile, it has emerged that Pfizer executives cashed in shares worth millions of pounds shortly before offering a higher bid for AstraZeneca. Chief executive Ian Read sold £6.3million of his holdings on February 26. Other senior figures to sell stakes in the days that followed included finance chief Frank D’Amelio, who made £5.3million, and principal accounting officer Loretta Cangialosi, who netted £1.8million. Pfizer’s share value has fallen nine per cent since Mr Read released his stake. The company announced a takeover bid in January and made a revised offer on April 28 of £48 a share, valuing the firm at around £63billion. Mr Soriot said the offer ‘seriously undervalues’ the company. City analysts believe Pfizer will offer £53 to £55-a-share. AstraZeneca’s shares rose more than 2 per cent yesterday, gaining 97p to close at 4,823.5p on the London Stock Exchange, as investors bet on a higher bid.","Scientists say takeover by Pfizer would be 'disruptive' to their work .

"By . John Stevens . An 'aunties army' is needed to combat the epidemic of eating disorders and self-harming among young girls, a leading child psychologist has warned. Steve Biddulph, author of the ground-breaking 1998 book Raising Boys, has become more concerned about today’s girls – and believes aunts should help bring up their nieces to increase the positive female role models in their lives. In his previous work, Biddulph said boys were seen as a ‘disaster area’ compared to girls. Difficult age: Aunties can help steer girls . through the 'toxic' influences of advertising and celebrity, a . best-selling psychologist has claimed. Picture posed by model . He said parents should delay their . sons starting formal education and suggested an increase in single-sex . classes in co-educational schools to help them reach their full . potential. But today, he argues, girls are giving greater cause for concern. Harmless fun? Recent research has shown the influences of rampant commercialism and celebrity are having a massive negative effect on girls . Biddulph says young girls are in a . ‘catastrophic’ state of crisis because of the ‘toxic’ influences of . advertising, celebrity and pornography which pressurise them to grow up . too quickly. In his new book, Raising Girls, he . writes: ‘To understand our daughters, we have to realise that their . childhood is not like ours. To put it bluntly, our 18 is their 14. Our . 14 is their ten. ‘Never before has girlhood been under . such a sustained assault, ranging through  everything from diet ads, . alcohol marketing and fashion pressures, to the inroads  of hard . pornography into teenage bedrooms.’ He adds: ‘About five years ago . . . we began to see a sudden and marked plunge in girls’ mental health. ‘Problems such as eating disorders and . self-harm, which once had been extremely rare, were now happening in . every classroom and every street.   But more than this, the  average . girl was stressed and depressed in a way we hadn’t seen before.’ However, he argues the ‘enormous pain . and confusion’ that girls experience can be eased by increasing the . number of women in their lives – other than their mothers – who can act . as mentors. Biddulph said parents and relatives . are not supporting girls in the way they did in the past. He added: ‘We . haven’t put enough adult time and care around our daughters, or taught . them well enough.’ Helping hand: The idea of the 'aunties army' can be seen in the example of actress Julia Roberts (left) who is devoted to her brother's daughter, up-and-coming actress Emma (right) Parents can avoid many of the pitfalls of having teenage girls by helping them find their identity between the ages of ten and 14, when girls start to feel a stronger sense of individuality, according to psychologist Steve Biddulph. If parents help their daughter find her ‘spark’ – something that she loves to do that gives her purpose – it will help free her from the need for approval that haunts many girls and diminishes their confidence, Biddulph writes in his book Raising Girls. He suggests parents should ask their children ‘what do you really love to do?’ and ‘how can I help you to do that?’ He lists skills or talents, such as drawing or dancing, that should be encouraged because children enjoy finding something they excel in. Biddulph writes that as children reach this age, parents should spend more time with them because it is a key period in helping girls find what makes them truly happy. Biddulph, who has a son and a . daughter, said that parents must spend more time with their children and . organise events to include other relatives. He said that by widening  the net of . parental responsibility to include women relatives, girls would feel . encouraged to share problems and confide in older people. Biddulph said this is important . because girls do not always get on well with their mothers and do not . feel they can discuss certain subjects with them. The idea of the ‘aunties army’ can be . seen in the example of actress Julia Roberts who is devoted to her . brother’s daughter, up-and-coming actress Emma. The 21-year-old, who bears a striking . resemblance to her aunt, has been steadily carving out a career under . her aunt’s mentorship, starring in teen movies Wild Child and Nancy . Drew, and appearing with her aunt in the 2010 romantic comedy . Valentine’s Day. When Emma was a child, her aunt allowed her to spend weeks on set with her. Biddulph’s new book is due to be . published later this month and follows the success of Raising Boys, . which has sold 3million copies worldwide.","Steve Biddulph, author of Raising Boys, has turned his attention to girls .

"By . Nina Golgowski . A 24-year-old man has unexpectedly died after undergoing what should have been a routine dental surgery in California. Marek Lapinski’s death is still shrouded in mystery today after reportedly falling deathly ill within hours of having his wisdom teeth taken out in Southern California last week. Mr Lapinski, the former vice president of T3D, a San Diego company specializing in tactical 3D equipment and cameras, was transferred to a Los Angeles hospital over the weekend where he died, WPXI reports. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Mysterious loss: Marek Lapinski, 24, died last weekend after undergoing what should have been routine dental surgery to have his wisdom teeth removed . Just the beginning: Mr Lapinski moved to California from Pennsylvania after graduating college in 2010, soon after launching a tactical device company in San Diego called T3D . Mr Lapinski's family say the young Pennsylvania native led a promising life now cut tragically short, having only graduated from Pittsburgh's Duquesne University in 2010 and one year later already working behind his own space and defense company. Among his company’s products was a device that allows any camera to produce 3D images on a screen with the help of a special software. 'He's going to leave a legacy that's just tremendous. It's just crushing now because we're all looking for a reason,' his cousin, Dustin Hook, told WPXI. 'He was the most driven and passionate person I knew. 'I'm just so glad he did what he wanted to do to make himself happy,' said Mr Hook. Tactical work: Some of Mr Lapinski's recent work with T3D was a device for military units, enabling any camera to turn photos into 3D ones . In one of Mr Lapinsk’s last public messages on Twitter last week he told his friends of his planned procedure scheduled for March 21st, as well as his expectations of soup and yogurt for the following few days. 'It's gonna suck big time buddy, it's the worst,' a friend wrote back to him. 'Thanks for the words of encouragement habibi,' Mr Lapinski jokingly replied. The Los Angeles County Coroner's Office says the body has yet to be examined leaving the cause of death still unknown. twitter . Young life: Family of Mr Lapinski say his death leaves a tremendous legacy behind with him only just starting his career . Unfortunately, deaths following the oral surgery, even while regularly performed, are not unheard of. In early 2011 a 17-year-old Maryland teen died following complications during the outpatient procedure. The official cause of death ruled by the state's chief medical examiner was hypoxia or oxygen deprivation while she was anesthetized. In early 2012 three other patients between the ages of 14 and 21 in Georgia died within 16 to 72 hours of having their wisdom teeth extracted. Dental expert Dr. Crystal Baxter told CBS Atlanta at the time that infections are one of the leading causes of dental deaths. 'The patient could develop a post-operative infection and that could lead to fatality,' said Baxter. 'You get swelling of the brain and then you get either brain damage or brain death.' Other potentially deadly causes are reactions to anesthesia, inhaling blood in the lungs leading to suffocation, reaction to prescribed drugs and bacteria in the mouth entering the blood stream.

"By . Inderdeep Bains . Furious: Police are unable to retrieve Kathleen McLelland and Michael Curry's stolen £30,000 caravan because officers have no legal powers to remove a traveller family now living in it . A couple whose £30,000 caravan was stolen have been told a traveller family now living in it cannot be removed because it would breach their human rights. Kathleen McClelland and her partner Michael Curry spent their life savings on the top-of-the-range camper and were devastated when it vanished from the secure site where they kept it. When police eventually found the 26ft-long Bailey Louisiana caravan 18 months later, its owners were told a traveller couple and their two young children were living in it only ten miles from their home in Surrey. Their initial relief turned to outrage, however, when the police said they had ‘no lawful powers’ to get it back. They were told their only option was to begin costly civil proceedings against the family, which they say they cannot afford. Mrs McClelland and Mr Curry had spent £10,000 improving the £20,000 caravan, including putting in a widescreen TV. They bought the vehicle on hire purchase – and still have to make monthly payments of £250 for the next two years. Hospital ward clerk Mrs McClelland, 68, said: ‘Why should we have to pay for someone else to live in our brand new caravan? That was for our pleasure in our older years. ‘The police said that removing the family would breach their human rights and that they would have to be rehoused before it could be seized. We spent all our retirement money on that caravan because we thought it would last us a lifetime. We’re absolutely devastated. It seems as though no one cares about our human rights. ‘I’ve worked all my life and saved up, surely I have the right to enjoy my retirement? When that caravan was stolen, our right to a happy retirement was stolen.’ The couple, who live in a semi-detached home in Tongham, Surrey, were in between insurance policies at the time of the theft in 2011 so were not covered for a payout. Holiday: Mrs McLelland is pictured by the caravan on an earlier trip before it was stolen . Pride and joy: Ms McLelland and Mr Curry's 26ft long caravan before it was stolen from a storage site in Hampshire . Powerless: A letter from Hampshire Constabulary informed the couple that officers would be unable to retrieve the stolen caravan . In an apologetic letter, PC Karen East . of Hampshire Constabulary told them the matter was out of the force’s . hands. It read: ‘Unfortunately it has transpired that we have no lawful . power to recover the caravan. It will be the responsibility of you as . the owner to start civil proceedings against the current occupier.’ The letter added: ‘I sincerely . apologise for this decision and I am sure that you feel the onus has . been put back to you but my hands have been tied due to police powers.’ Last September police located and . identified the caravan in Hook, Hampshire, after interviewing a suspect . for an unrelated offence. But because officers did not have evidence . that the current occupier knew the caravan was stolen when he allegedly . purchased it, he could not be prosecuted and the force said it was . unable to seize it. Mr Curry, 53, who gave up his job as . an HGV driver after being diagnosed with diabetes, said the police . refused to reveal the caravan’s exact location. ‘I just cannot comprehend it,’ he . said. ‘If I was stopped by the police and it turned out my car, which I . had brought in good faith, was stolen, it would be confiscated and I . would lose my money.’ Mr Curry said they bought the caravan . in 2007 and would use it for family weekends away in Cornwall, Cumbria, . Scotland and the south coast. It was stolen from a secure storage site . in Crookham, Hampshire, after thieves disabled the alarm and cut through . a wheel clamp and lock. Gone: The couple's caravan was stolen from this storage park in Hampshire in 2011 . When the caravan was eventually found the couple were asked to provide proof of ownership, a logbook and photos. They learned that the family found . living in the caravan had taken it all over the country before . temporarily settling down ten miles away from them. Mr Curry said: ‘Apparently they had a receipt for it and had paid a guy £300 in a pub for it. ‘They had no proof apart from a . handwritten note on a scrap of paper, while we had everything proving it . was ours. If they wanted a caravan, why not save up for it like we did? ‘I have lost all faith in the police. It seems that they have completely let us down and turned their backs on us.’ A Hampshire Police spokesman said: ‘A . 22-year-old man from Hook was arrested and interviewed on suspicion of . theft, however there was insufficient evidence to prove he had been . involved in the theft, or would have known the caravan was stolen when . he bought it. He was released with no further action. ‘We have no police powers to seize the caravan and have advised the owners to seek civil action in order to recover it.’","Kathleen McLelland and Michael Curry had their caravan stolen in 2011 .

"By . Joshua Gardner . A fiercely loyal dog was found in the searing Oklahoma heat Saturday steadfastly refusing to leave the side of his deceased owner. Animal control officers in Oklahoma City were called to the scene as the bull terrier fought hard to stay in the 100 degree Fahrenheit heat. Now at the local shelter, the dog's defiance has turned to sorrow as he displays behaviors strongly associated with mourning: he refuses to eat, to drink or even lift his head. Loyal: Oklahoma City officials are seen here struggling to get a fiercely loyal bull terrier away from his deceased owner in the searing summer heat . Sad: Even with temperatures nearing 100F, the dog stayed with his dead owner and fought hard to stay with him as officials dragged him away . 'The dog kept wanting to pull back to go back to where the remains of where the deceased owner was,' Oklahoma City Animal Shelter supervisor Sheridan Lowery told KFOR. Officials said the dog had remained at the body of his likely transient owner, who died from natural causes, despite having every opportunity to go find water and shelter from the relentless sun. After authorities arrived and eventually pried the pooch away, he was taken to the animal shelter, where he remained Monday. Mourning: The pooch is now exhibiting classic signs of grief: he won't eat, sleep or even lift his head . 'Their owner is deceased. They don¿t know what is going on. They don¿t know how to act. They don¿t know how to react,' said Oklahoma City Animal shelter supervisor Sheridan Lowery . Footage of the dog shows him unable at times to even muster the will to lift his head. They're the classic signs of grief, from which even dogs can suffer. 'Their owner is deceased. They don’t know what is going on. They don’t know how to act. They don’t know how to react,' said Lowery. The pup will hopefully next be placed with a family that can help lift his broken spirit. 'If he’s shown this kind of attachment, this kind of dedication to family he could make a really good family pet,' says Lowery. Looking up? The dog will hopefully soon find a new family if officials fail to find any living relatives of the deceased owner .","The bull terrier was found protecting the body of his master in the searing Oklahoma summer heat .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A mother is fighting for her autistic son's right to an education after public school officials tried to palm her off with a settlement check to keep him away from classes, it has been revealed today. Heather Houston wants her son David, 21, who is mute and has diabetes, to attend school in California until he is 22 which is his legal right. Ms Houston said that authorities have failed to follow her son's individual education plan and taken extreme measures to keep him out of school, even offering her $86,000 last week. The right to learn: David Swanson, 21, who has autism and diabetes, has been discriminated against by his Californian school, his mother has claimed . She received the . large check after her son was turned away from the first day of the . school year on August 15. David is currently being home-schooled. This followed an offer of $50,000 in June to keep David out of school, which the mother rejected. Ms Houston has been negotiating with Yuba City Unified School District and Sutter County Superintendent of Schools since last year after lodging civil rights complaints that her son was force-fed and left out of school activities. Ms Houston told ABC: 'The law says he's allowed access to . education. I don't want their money. I never . wanted their money.' The family received an unsigned letter . on August 27 which offered $86,000 for David to be kept away from . public school. He is currently entitled to go to school until his 22nd . birthday next spring. Eager to learn: David, 21,  is mute but able to communicate with others using his iPad . If Ms Houston accepts the money, she must drop any legal complaints against the school, the letter states. Ms Houston told WUSA 9: 'You could offer me a million. I'm not going to take any money to sign away my son's rights to an education.' The autistic student's education plan includes learning how to write down his name and phone number incase he gets lost, communicating with words on his iPad and about hygiene. Annette Armstrong is the private nurse who goes to school with David to monitor his diabetes. She also understands when he is upset as he hums or puts his fingers in his ears. She has cared for the autistic man for the past five years but claims that she was fired because she complained about a teacher force-feeding David. Battle: Heather Houston says that she does not care about the money but wants her son David to be able to go to school (right) Ms Armstrong said that one lunchtime, a teacher tried to feed David with a metal fork which he cannot use because his autism leaves him with extreme sensitivity to metal. The nurse said that when David spit out the food, the teacher mixed it back into his bowl and made him eat it again. The incident left the student vomiting. Nurse Armstrong added: 'I always have tried to … advocate for . David and just try to get through the day. Why do we have to make the . kid so upset that he pukes on his shoes?' Ms Houston claims that David was later barred from campus with his private nurse after she refused to sign a waiver to allow another nurse to become involved in his care. The Department . of Education states that public schools are required to provide free . and appropriate education for children with disabilities. Both school districts deny any wrongdoing. Ms Houston is now taking her son's battle for an education to court.","Heather Houston wants her son David, 21, who is mute and has diabetes, to attend school in Yuba City, California .

"By . Ted Thornhill . Regardless of your physical state, many fitness gadgets or apps try and push you that bit further. But one new sports gizmo has a different approach – it’ll pipe up and tell you to sit back and put your feet up if it thinks a workout will result in an injury. Called ‘Check’, by FAM Sports, the device searches for signs of fatigue in your nervous system before you set off for a run or begin pumping iron, and warns you if there’s a chance you could be overdoing it. Assessment: The makers of the Check fitness gadget claim that their device can help prevent injuries by warning you if you're too tired for a workout . The gadget’s website boasts that the check takes just 15 seconds, with the assessment carried out via electrodes that are placed on the forearm (pictured above). They send tiny pulses of electricity through the body and how your nervous system reacts to these will determine whether the gadget advises you to face the fitness music, or run a bath. The website says that it’s ‘specifically aimed for sports requiring speed, strength, skill and coordination’. And there are reportedly a number of Premier League footballers who are fans, so it's undoubtedly a useful bit of kit. However, those not on a footballers' salary may find it prohibitively expensive. It costs £225 and many might prefer instead to fashion training regimes for free with the help of common sense and internet research. Safety first: The gadget measures the response of your nervous system  to electronic pulses before deciding whether you should throw in the towel .","The device sends electric pulses through your nervous system to assess your physical state .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Without immigration British women will have to have 'a lot of children very quickly' to keep the economy and the NHS afloat, a Labour rising star has claimed. Stella Creasy, 37, said Nigel Farage was 'deeply unpatriotic' because his policies on Europe and immigration were 'basically talking about managing the decline of Britain'. The unmarried Labour MP said without immigration women already in the UK will have to breed for Britain to support the growing number of pensioners. Labour rising star Stella Creasy said British women would have to have 'a lot of children very quickly' if the country slashed immigration. She said there were not enough youngsters to support the rapidly ageing population . Miss Creasy said society was 'rife with sexism' and so was politics. She said the 'Commons and politics is no different' to everywhere else. The Labour MP said: ‘Parliament, like society, is full of all sorts of unconscious barriers to equality. 'You know, if I hear another person saying that “leadership takes balls”. 'This is not being disrespectful to Mr Balls, but surely we should say leadership is about guts. It’s not gender-specific.’ Miss Creasy, who does not have children, said without a baby boom 'our ability to sustain our economy' will collapse - leaving the NHS in crisis. The Labour MP's controversial remarks are likely to spark controversy and come just days after the former Tory Chancellor Lord Lamont dismissed the claim that immigration was needed to cope with an ageing society. In a letter to The Times newspaper he cited a House of Lords report that found ‘no evidence. . . that immigration generates significant economic benefit’ and rubbished the claim that migrants were a ‘bulwark against an ageing population’. He said this would lead to a need for ‘ever escalating levels of immigration’ as the migrants themselves became old and needed more youngsters in the country to look after them as well. But Miss Creasy said UKIP were a party of hand wringers who complain 'Isn't it awful' while running Britain down. She said: 'I think Nigel Farage is actually, frankly, deeply unpatriotic because he’s basically talking about managing the decline of Britain. 'He doesn’t seem to think that we can compete with German inventors or that we can compete with the French capital. He seems to have written us off.’ Miss Creasy, appearing on 'This Morning' in August last year, was the victim of vile  online abuse over support for a woman to be featured on a bank note. She also led a successful campaign to force the Government to clamp down on pay day lenders changing sky-high interest rates . Miss Creasy, pictured here in Portcullis House in Westminster, is the Labour Member of Parliament for Walthamstow in east London. She has been tipped as a future Labour leader . She adds: ‘Talk to Nigel Farage not just about the immigrants who come here and create jobs but the immigrants who come here and create skills and create opportunities for people and create new ideas for people. Miss Creasy said Nigel Farage was 'deeply unpatriotic' because his policies would result in the 'decline' of Britain . ‘There are now more people over the age of 65 than under the age of 16 in Britain. ‘So unless women like me have a lot of children very quickly our ability to sustain our economy, to sustain our public services [will come under threat]. 'It’s not just that these guys want to charge you to use the NHS, it’s that their policies will actually mean the NHS will not exist by [Britain] not being able to have an economy than can support it.’ Miss Creasy said unlike UKIP she was 'incredibly optimistic about the future’. But she warned that the amount of debt families were taking on could cause the economy to crash. She said: ‘We have this big bubble of personal debt coming up and … it will drag us all down. ‘We have to stop being British and coy about talking about debt because that’s where these companies do well, [it] is people feeling ashamed. 'It can’t be a silent source of shame any more, it’s got to be something we talk about and which we manage together as a community.’ Miss Creasy also hit out at left wingers in her party who are angry at plans to make cuts to reduce the deficit. She said: ‘If we get our economy wrong, it’s the poorest who miss out and they pay the most comparatively in taxes.' She added: ‘Everyone’s very negative about this idea that we’re going to face difficult financial challenges.' She sees instead the chance to ‘reshape services to get better outcomes for people. Actually it will be cheaper.’","Party rising star says migrants crucial to support growing number of elderly .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Team USA has a shot at medaling in the Men's Figure Skating competition with Jason Brown and his now-famous ponytail. The 19-year-old placed sixth after his short-program routine today, and still has the chance to out-perform his competition and take the bronze with his long-program tomorrow. Japan's Yuzuru Hanyu currently leads the competition and Russian legend Evgeni Plushenko pulled out after taking a fall in practice. Brown, a native of Highland Park, Illinois, is optimistic he'll be on the medal stand come Friday. Perfect: American Jason Brown of Highland Park, Illinois skated a flawless short-program routine Thursday at the Olympics in Sochi . Bronze contender: Brown was in sixth place at the end of the short-program day. He still has a chance to medal if he outperforms his competition in the long-program on Friday . Anchor: Brown will be the last to perform in Friday's long-program competition . Team player: Brown helped the U.S. win bronze in the team skating competition . 'All year in this program, in every competition I have gone to, I have gotten a personal best,' Brown said. 'I didn’t want to stop in the Olympics.' Brown will be the last to perform in the long-program Friday. Brown skated a flawless short program at Sochi today, in his Olympic debut. In the end he scored a high 86, putting him just margins of a point away from Javier Fernandez of Spain in third, Daisuke Takahashi of Japan in fourth and Peter Liebers of German in fifth. Brown's going to have to skate a near-perfect routine if he wants to medal since he doesn't a quad jump like the top-tier of the competitors. Tactic: Brown will have to skate perfectly and count on his competition messing up if he wants a shot at the medal stand since he doesn't perform quad jumps . Hands in the air: Brown gives a happy wave after his short-program performance Thursday . Kicking his heels: Brown seemed to be having a whale of a time on the ice . Overwhelmed: Brown smiles with joy after hearing his score, as he leans on coach Kori Ade's shoulder . His teammate Jeremy Abbott attempted a quad today with not so spectacular results. Abbott took a spectacular tumble on the ice after attempting a quad jump and lay in pain for 10 seconds as the music continued to play - before pulling himself up, rubbing his hip and . gliding back into the center of the ice. Applause erupted for the 28-year-old when he finished and raised his arms confidently with a smile. Oops: Jeremy Abbott falls after failing to complete a jump in the Men's Short Program on Thursday .

Ignoring his coaches who had rushed to his aid, he took off again - finishing the rest of the routine with ease. He landed a triple lutz-triple toe combination followed by a spin and a triple axel. As the crowd cheered, Abbott appeared surprised at his feat, and scored a surprising 72.58 - pushing him to first place and allowing him to qualify, although 20 skaters were yet to perform. After his performance, he told reporters about his determination to finish, the Washington Post reported. 'The second I stood up and all of the audience was screaming, I was like, ""I'm finishing the program; I don’t care if I’m two minutes late. I don’t care what happens with the rest of it. But I’m getting up and not going to give up this moment!!' he said. He's up! Abbott limps away from the boards - his face creased with pain - but he is determined to carry on . 'As much of a disappointment as this is, I'm not ashamed. I'm not in the least bit ashamed. I stood up, and I finished that program. And I'm proud of my effort, and I’m proud of what I did under the circumstances.' At the end of the short program day, Abbott was in 15th place. He will appear in the free skate on Friday. His fall on Thursday was just another example of the struggles Team USA has faced in Sochi - including surprise losses, injuries and complaints about the conditions. Fighter: Both Russian and American spectators broke into applause as Abbott finished up his routine . Johnny Weir, a former US skater who is . working as a commentator for NBC in Sochi, expressed his doubt at the . strength of the skating team this year. 'From . a numbers perspective, the Grand Prix final is the biggest pre-Olympic . even where skaters from all over the world come together and are . competing against one another... and before the Vancouver Olympics, . there were three American men in those final six,' he said. 'This . season we weren't even that close to having a shot at going to the . Grand Prix final for even one (male) skater. From a numbers standpoint, . most likely this is the weakest team we've had in a long time at the . Olympics.'

A Turkish waiter made a chilling death threat to the British mother who refused to let him marry her 15-year-old daughter, before stabbing her and her best friend to death. Recep Celik, 17, lured Marion Graham and Kathy Dinsmore, both 53, to a secluded wood and cut their throats because he was infatuated with Miss Graham's daughter Shannon who he had been dating for two years. Last week her mother Marion, 53, had a blazing row with Celik, who uses the name Alex. Suspect: Suspect Recep Celik, left, is accused of killing the mother of his girlfriend Shannon Graham, pictured, in a frenzied attack . Recep Celik is accused of stabbing Marion Graham (left) and Kathy Dinsmore, both 54 and from Northern Ireland . After he kicked Shannon during an . altercation, Miss Graham ‘went ballistic’ and told him never to lay a . finger on her daughter again. The waiter apparently responded by threatening to kill Miss Graham if she came between him and Shannon. Last night Turkey’s state-run news . agency Anatolia said Celik had confessed to killing Miss Graham and her . friend Cathy Dinsmore, also 53, who both came from Newry, County Down, . Northern Ireland. Shannon was being cared for by an . Irish Embassy official. ‘She is in an absolutely dreadful state but we . are doing our best to comfort her,’ a consular source said. For several years Miss Graham, Miss . Dinsmore and Shannon have been regular visitors to Turkey, where Miss . Graham’s family own a holiday home in the popular seaside resort of . Kusadasi. Shannon and Alex started dating after she and her mother visited the restaurant where he worked. Like many naive British girls who find . love on holiday in Turkey, she was bowled over by his attention and . soon found what started as a holiday romance turned into a marriage . proposal. She travelled to see him every school holiday. Media reports in Turkey have named Recep Celik as the 17-year-old Turkish suspect said to have carried out the attacks . Pictures of them together show them . holding hands and smiling. But yesterday Shannon’s father, Raymond . McGuinness, said her mother was terrified Celik was abusing her. Mr . McGuinness, who was flying out to be with his daughter early today, said . he was never fully in favour of the relationship. ‘There was always something that was not quite right,’ he said. An English holidaymaker who became . friendly with Shannon and Celik said the Turkish youth seemed to be . ‘very possessive’ and ‘desperate’ to marry Shannon. The woman, who asked not to be named, . said: ‘He used to write to Shannon on Facebook when she was back in . Northern Ireland. If she didn’t message him regularly enough, he would . be messaging her asking why. Arrest: Eyup Cetin, the father of the 17-year-old murder suspect named by Turkish media as Recep Celik is pictured being led away in handcuffs for questioning, while right, the Turkish youth and Shannon Graham are photographed together . ‘He was even strange to people like . me, just friends. If I passed him in the street without hugging him he’d . hold it against me and act strangely for the next few days.’ On Thursday, Celik sent Shannon on a . boat tour off Kusadasi while he offered to take her mother and Miss . Dinsmore on a sightseeing tour of Izmir, 60 miles away. They travelled there by taxi. Once in . the city, Celik collected his father’s car and drove the women to a . wooded area in Buca, a suburb of Izmir notorious locally as a crime . hotspot, where he slashed their throats.

"By . Tom Leonard . Stuart Armstrong, with his wife Miriam, and Anders Sandberg have signed up to be frozen after their death . They were a shattered world’s last hope — three great minds from the past who might be able to avert a catastrophe that threatened to extinguish mankind. In a medical storage facility in the Arizona desert, digital screens that had been dark for centuries suddenly flickered into life as the remains of three beings stirred into life after aeons of slumber. It’s difficult to say whether this sort of Hollywood sci-fi scenario ever occurred to three Oxford University dons when they signed up to be frozen after death. But what they cannot deny is that along with thousands of others they are putting their faith in a future — known as cryonics — that is more science fiction than science fact. It was revealed yesterday that the trio — Nick Bostrom, professor of philosophy at Oxford’s Future of Humanity Institute, and his fellow lead researchers, Anders Sandberg and Stuart Armstrong — have agreed to pay a U.S. company anything up to £50,000 to have their remains frozen at death. The hope is a future society will have the technology to restore them to life. Armstrong has arranged for his entire body to be frozen by the Michigan-based Cryonics Institute. His wife is expecting their first baby and he is so enthused by the idea that he wants to sign the child up, too. His two colleagues have opted for the less glamorous but cheaper and supposedly more reliable option of having just their heads frozen when they are declared dead, by the Alcor Life Extension Foundation outside Phoenix, Arizona. Their heads will be perfused with a cocktail of antifreeze chemicals and preserved in liquid nitrogen at -196c. Professor of philosophy Nick Bostrom (right), . and fellow researcher Anders Sandberg (left) have signed up to pay an . American company up to £50,000 to have their heads stored in liquid nitrogen after death . Previous acolytes of cryonics have . often been dismissed as head-in-the-clouds cranks, sci-fi buffs who have . watched too much TV or victims of vanity. Britney . Spears and Paris Hilton have both waxed lyrical about being frozen. Simon Cowell is believed to be among several dozen Britons who have . joined a cryonics programme, although several hundred have reportedly . shown interest. But most of . them are ordinary people — usually retirees who are thinking about . defeating death. The science may be sketchy but the principle is simple: . nothing ventured, nothing gained. But . Prof Bostrom and his colleagues are young, highly educated specialists . who have devoted their careers to humanity. If they are signing up for . cryonics, one might think, perhaps we should all pay attention. Stuart Armstrong, a colleague at the Future of Humanity Institute (FHI), part of the prestigious Oxford Martin School, has opted to have his whole body frozen . And while scientists generally dismiss . cryonics for human beings, saying it is far beyond our capabilities, it . is interesting that Prof Bostrom has a science background that includes . physics and neuroscience. The 40-year-old Swede is on Foreign . Policy magazine’s list of 100 Global Thinkers. His institute is part of . the Oxford Martin School, where 300 academics tackle issues such as . population growth, inequality and climate change. It’s encouraging that, . in the midst of so much doom-mongering about the future, he is keen to . come back again. ‘Look back at what has happened over . the past 100 years, and how many features of today’s world somebody from . 1913 would have failed to anticipate,’ he told a newspaper. ‘The more . uncertain you are about the future, the more it makes sense to keep your . options alive — for example, by trying to preserve as much as possible . of the information content in your brain, rather than throwing it away.’ On his internet home page, Sandberg, 41, also Swedish, describes himself as ‘questing’ and ‘always very happy’. He says it will be ‘very exciting’ to . wake up in a new world. Admittedly, his life would be limited as a . disembodied head but, in the future, he predicts people will be able to . make ‘real connections’ to computers. He hopes his memories and . personality could be downloaded. He and Bostrom may not even have to . put up with living with just their heads: some cryonics devotees insist . future science will be able to clone human bodies so the defrosted, . severed head can be attached to a new body. Their colleague, Stuart Armstrong, . says it costs him £25 a month in premiums to cover the cost of having . his body cryopreserved — far cheaper, he says, than the popular . alternative of prolonging life, which is to join a gym. Like his colleagues, he seems one of . life’s optimists: ‘If you picture the world in, say, 200 years, when . reanimation is possible, it will probably be a wonderful place.’ By the time they are rushed down to . the liquid nitrogen tanks of Alcor, the Oxford academics will be in . illustrious company. Alcor has 117 patients already in cryopreservation . and 985 members waiting to join them. Those already lying in state include . Ted Williams, one of the greatest stars of baseball, who died in 2002. And Dick Clair, a U.S. TV sitcom writer, has been there since 1988 . following his death from AIDS. Prof Bostrom and Dr Sandberg have agreed to be frozen with the help of Alcor, which is based near Phoenix, in  Arizona . Williams became the focus of a family . row over how he wanted his body disposed of which focused on the . authenticity of a note in which he supposedly chose cryonics. It was . later claimed that a technician at Alcor took baseball-style swings at . Williams’ severed head with a monkey wrench. As for those still alive but already . committed to Alcor, the list includes film director Charles Matthau and . British thinkers Aubrey de Grey and Max More. Recognisable by a silver . bracelet they usually wear to specify their wishes to be frozen when . they die, believers in Britain even have a support group: Cryonics UK. Alan Sinclair, 75, a retired electronics expert from West Sussex, has . been a leading light in British cryonics since the mid-Eighties. A few weeks ago his wife, Sylvia, . became the first Briton to be properly cryonically preserved. She died . of lung cancer after an illness of just three weeks, and was rushed to . the Cryonics Institute in America. With the possibility on his mind of a . reunion with his beloved wife of 40 years, he tells me scientific . progress has led British interest in cryonics to ‘mushroom’ in the past . five years. But he says: ‘There wouldn’t be any point bringing back a 90-year-old.’ Who wouldn’t be interested in having a . good few years added to their lives, I observe. Isn’t the difference . that most people want them now when their loved ones are still with . them? Dr. Jerry Lemler, president and CEO of Alcor Life Extension Foundation, stands in the Patient Care Bay area where the heads and bodies of 49 individuals are being held in cold storage suspension . ‘I don’t see that as a problem,’ says . Sinclair. ‘What happens when you leave school and move to Australia. We . move to completely alien environments all the time.’ But will a future world want to bring back people who have opted to be frozen? When Simon Cowell dropped his cryonics . plan bombshell at a Downing Street party, his host, Gordon Brown, . reportedly pointed out he wasn’t sure if his reanimation would be so . popular. Prof Bostrom is already a regular on . TV and in the media. A future society would doubtless be intrigued to . know what an academic of his standing has to say about its world. But . what about an ex-housewife or former electrical technician? ‘That’s the biggest problem,’ says . Sinclair. ‘Why would anyone bring me back?’ Cryonics patients won’t have . much novelty value when there are millions of them. Indeed, the cryonics companies don’t . really guarantee much. Success depends on the body first getting to them . in the U.S. as quickly as possible. And although their freezing fee — . which varies between £16,500 and £125,000 — is supposed to cover an . indefinite period, who is to know the company will stay in business? It is a ‘leap of faith, but a leap of . faith in science’, Sinclair insists. ‘Unless we want to go into . oblivion, this is the only scientific means I know of to avoid it.’ For people like him and his fellow . death-defiers at Oxford, there can be no possible concession to the idea . that oblivion may be something to be embraced.","Nick Bostrom, Anders Sandberg, Stuart Armstrong to be frozen after death .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . London may be famed for its historic sites, double-decker buses and West End shows, but it now has a more dubious distinction: It has become the tuberculosis capital of Western Europe. In response, health officials are taking to the streets in an effort to stop the spread of the infectious lung disease, with the help of a van equipped with an X-ray machine that drives around London offering free check-ups. Similar vans were once commonly used 1950s but most disappeared about two decades later when TB rates dropped. But in recent years, the disease has surged in the U.K. A TB van parked outside a homeless shelter in East London. Last year, London had about 3,500 tuberculosis cases - more than the Netherlands, Belgium, Greece and Norway combined .

Radiographer Diana Taubman, left, prepares Clifton Owens, 51, for his X-ray . Last year, London had more TB cases than the Netherlands, Belgium, Greece and Norway combined. It also had more TB than African countries including Eritrea and Gambia. 'We kind of took our eye off the ball and now TB has become a big problem again,' said Dr. Alistair Story, who runs the mobile TB van for University College London Hospitals. He said the vast majority of TB in the U.K. is among the homeless, drug users and prisoners because they live in cramped, close conditions, which makes them susceptible to infections. Despite the belief that TB is being imported into the U.K. by recent immigrants, Story said their rates of infection are low. Clifton Owens, 51, discusses his negative X-ray with radiographer Diana Taubman . An X-ray showing  a patient with TB (the white dots are pellets from a shotgun injury). London's TB van has an X-ray machine and scans can be instantly read by a radiographer . 'It's certainly not the case that we could have closed the borders and avoided the problem,' he said, pointing out that other European countries with high levels of immigration, including France and Germany, have not had similar spikes of TB. Last year, London had about 3,500 TB cases. Tuberculosis is a highly infectious bacterial disease often spread by coughing or sneezing and kills more than 1 million people worldwide every year. It most often attacks the lungs and is highly treatable. More than 95 per cent of TB deaths occur in developing countries and experts are increasingly concerned about the rise of drug-resistant strains, which require more toxic drugs to treat. London's £460,000 TB van has an X-ray machine whose scans can be instantly read by a radiographer. On average, the van picks up about one new TB case per week and screens about 10,000 people a year. If an X-ray looks worrying, staff call a hospital to arrange confirmatory tests. The entire process of getting an X-ray and its results takes about 90 seconds.

Dr. Ajit Lalvani, chair of infectious diseases at Imperial College London, said 70 percent of people with latent TB who arrive in Britain are missed. They aren't currently infectious, but Lalvani said the TB bacteria could sicken them in the future and cause them to infect others. Catching these patients would require a more expensive blood or skin test that isn't commonly used. 'There is a vast reservoir of TB that comes into this country silently,"" he said. ""The mobile van is providing a great service, but until we test more widely, we will never get rid of TB in the U.K.'","Similar vans were once commonly used 1950s but most disappeared in the 1970s when TB rates dropped .

"By . Christian Gysin . An unrepentant Anders Breivik yesterday defended his killing spree claiming  he would ‘do it again’ given the chance. In an incredible show of bravado the 33-year-old Norwegian boasted he was responsible for the most ‘sophisticated and spectacular’ attack by a nationalist ‘resistance fighter’ since the Second World War. But he demanded to be found innocent and insisted he had acted out of ‘goodness and not evil’ when he killed 77 people in gun and bomb attacks last July. Statement: Breivik pictured approaching the witness stand yesterday so he could make his first testimony in five days of questioning . Salute: For the second day in a row, killer Breivik clenched his his fist in front of him as he entered the Oslo courtroom . Proceedings: Breivik is today set to begin his five-day testimony, which many fear he will use to promote his Islamophobic ideology . Breivik said he was acting ‘in self-defence of my country’ to prevent a civil war and declared: ‘I would have done it again.’ He said he had been inspired by Al . Qaeda’s use of martyrdom and described his actions as ‘a suicide attack’ which he had not expected to survive. In a rambling performance lasting an . hour and ten minutes the Right-wing anti-Muslim extremist compared . himself to Native American warriors such as Sitting Bull who had ‘fought . for indigenous rights’. Dismissed: Lay judge Thomas Indreboe posted comments online saying Breivik should be executed . He also invoked the late Enoch Powell . to warn of ‘rivers of blood’ in Europe and mentioned ‘multiculturalism . in Luton’. Injured victims and families of the bereaved were at the . court in Oslo to hear the prepared statement which was not broadcast on . Norwegian TV. It was interrupted four times by lawyers or judges to . hurry him up or, once, because what he said was hurtful to the families. This was when he compared the . Norwegian Labour Party’s youth wing group, who were camping on the . island of Utoya where he  killed 69 youngsters, to the Hitler Youth. He . said: ‘The majority of young people were brainwashed and naive, . indoctrinated by schools or their parents. They were not innocents but . they actively upheld multicultural values. ‘Many people had leading positions in . the Labour Party youth wing and were on county boards. They were in many . ways similar to Hitler Youth at an indoctrination camp.’ In justifying his actions Breivik . quoted from surveys conducted in Britain about multiculturalism and . referenced Mr Powell’s infamous 1968 ‘Rivers of Blood’ speech in which . the Tory politician warned of the perceived dangers of greater . immigration from Commonwealth countries. Breivik began by describing himself as . a member of the ‘Norwegian European Resistance Movement’. Carrying a killer: Norwegian mass murderer was brought to the Oslo courtroom in this van . Route: Breivik is to make the daily trip between Ila prison in Baerum near Oslo, and the courthouse in the Norwegian capital . Close eye: Breivik will be escorted by police car and motorbike each day of his 10-week trial . He said he . was a ‘nationalist’ responsible for the most ‘sophisticated and . spectacular act’ since the Second World War. He claimed Marxists and liberals had . brainwashed the young in Norway and Europe by infiltrating schools and . colleges and said there was ‘now no democracy in Norway’. Turning to . Britain he said a recent survey suggested 69 per cent of the population . see immigration as a ‘major or great problem’. The red dots indicate the dead on Utoya island while the yellow indicate the wounded. The 2's indicate being wounded twice and the x indicates a victim who later died from the gunshot wounds . He added that another survey in the . Times in February 2010 had reported that ‘three out of five English . believe that the UK has become dysfunctional because of . multiculturalism’. He said the same views were held by many people in ‘Norway, Sweden, Germany and France’. Of his actions on July 22 he said: ‘I . would have done it again because offences against my people – and many . partisans – are in many ways just as bad.’ Drawing to a close he said: ‘I was . born and grew up in a conflict zone that is Oslo. The Labour Party . bought flats in West Oslo and handed them out to Muslims. Carnage: A man lies injured in the road amid wreckage from the Oslo blast as emergency service personnel rush to help him . Victims: Just some of the 77 killed by Breivik in a day of carnage last year . Muslims want . autonomy under Sharia law in places like Luton, Paris and Marseille.’ Breivik ended by saying: ‘The attacks . on July 22 were a preventive strike. I acted in self-defence on behalf . of my people, my city, my country. I therefore demand to be found . innocent of the charges.’ Under cross-examination he said: ‘I . know what happened on July 22 was gruesome – but it was cruel and . necessary. I was involved in a suicide attack and I did not expect to . survive the day.’ Eight people died in a bomb attack by . Breivik in the centre of Oslo. The 69 who died during his gun rampage on . Utoya the same day were mostly teenagers. He has said: ‘I admit to the . acts – but not criminal guilt.’ Crime scene: The white van was believed to have been driven onto the island of Utoya by the gunman who then opened fire on groups of children attending a summer camp . Anders Behring Breivik walks with a gun in hand among bodies on Utoya . Terror: Teenagers on the Norwegian holiday island of Utoya had to 'swim for their lives' and hide in trees when Breivik fired indiscriminately at them . ● The second day began with the . dismissal of a lay judge for having said on Facebook that the killer . should get the death penalty. It emerged yesterday that the day after . the massacre Judge Thomas Indrebo posted: ‘The death penalty is the only . just thing to do in this case.’ He was replaced by a ‘reserve’ on the . panel of three lay judges and two professionals. CCTV: Surveillance footage shows Anders Behring Breivik, dressed in police uniform and carrying a pistol,  as he walks away from a car after placing a bomb in Oslo last year .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Trailblazer: Air Force Lt. Gen. Lori J. Robinson has been nominated to become the first female non-pilot commander of the Air Force in the Pacific . A female general who has never piloted a military aircraft has been nominated by US President Barack Obama to head the Air Force in the Pacific. Air Force Lt. Gen. Lori J. Robinson was nominated by the president for a fourth star and to be commanding general of the military branch’s Pacific operations. If confirmed, she will be the first four-star female commander of combat forces, the Pentagon announced. But many wonder if her lack of experience in the air puts US forces on a highway to the danger zone. ‘You make operational decisions that require the understanding of what you are going to ask pilots to execute in combat where the wrong decisions mean the difference between life and death,’ a retired pilot told the Washington Times. ‘Now her vice commander and director of operations will be rated fighter pilots, but still she makes the decisions.’ Despite her lack of experience behind the controls, she is currently the vice commander of Air Force Combat Command – which is in charge of bomber and fighter jets. Her time in this capacity was used as defense by the Pentagon for her nomination. ‘The Air Force operates across three domains: air, space and cyberspace and provides capability and capacity in five core mission areas: Air and Space Superiority, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, Rapid Global Mobility, Global Strike and Command and Control,’ spokesperson Rose Richardson told the paper. ‘Lt. Gen. Robinson has demonstrated knowledge and experience across the entire spectrum of these mission areas as well as recent operational application supporting coalition activities for United States Central Command.’ Still, she would be replacing General Herbert Carlisle, a career pilot moving on to become the new commander of the Air Combat Command at Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Virginia, according to Stars and Stripes. Her appointment comes amid an effort from the Pentagon to diversify the higher ranks of the military amid a series of rape and sexual misconduct scandals in the nation’s armed services, according to the Times. Only 85 out of the more than 3,700 active duty fighter pilots in the U.S. military are women, according to federal statistics. Robinson will be the second woman to rise to the level of four-star general in the Air Force.","Air Force Lt. Gen. Lori J.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A 17-year-old Irish boy who is currently in jail in Cairo could have been 'beaten to hell' by Egyptian prison guards, according to his sister. Ibrihim Halawa and his three sisters were caught up in violence at the Al Fateh mosque on Saturday, and detained by security forces when they stormed the building. Their sister Nasaybi Halawa, at the family home in Dublin, said she believed her siblings are being held at Tora prison, where all the men have been beaten. Arrested: The Halawa siblings, Ibrihim, Fatima, Omaima and Somala (pictured left to right) are currently in a Cairo jail after getting caught up in protests at a mosque . Family: Hussein Halawa, pictured with Omama, is the imam of Ireland's largest mosque . 'I was speaking to someone a few minutes ago and they told me that they saw my sister in Tora jail and I asked them about my brother,' Ms Halawa said. 'The person I'm speaking to told me they were beating men to hell. She doesn't know how my brother looks but she told me, ""I can guarantee for you, all the men were beaten there. They didn't exclude anyone from hitting them.""' The chaotic situation in Egypt has continued for the past two days, with mass killings reported on both sides of the political divide. Yesterday 36 Muslim Brotherhood members died while being transported to jail when police fired tear gas into their prison van, apparently after the detainees started a riot. This morning, militants in the lawless Sinai Peninsula ambushed two prison vans and killed 25 off-duty police officers in execution style. William Hague spoke out this morning to warn that the country would face 'years of turbulence' as civil conflict rages. Location: The siblings are being held in the Tora prison, where male inmates are routinely beaten . Ibrihim was arrested on Saturday along with his sisters Omaima, 20, Fatima, 22, and Somaia, 27. He . completed his school leaving certificate before the summer holiday, and . was due to hear back from the universities he applied to today. His . father, Sheikh Hussein Halawa - the imam of Ireland's largest mosque - . has appealed for the Irish Government to act quickly to free his . children from detention. Ms . Halawa said she was worried her siblings would be killed, telling RTE . Radio: 'There is no difference now between anyone. They can kill anyone. 'We don't know anything about my brother and sisters. We don't know if they are safe. 'We . don't know if they are eating or drinking, where they sleep now, . whether they have had any food since they left the home last time. We . don't know anything about them.' Carnage: The scene outside the Al Fateh mosque on Saturday, when the Halawa siblings were arrested . Flashpoint: The mosque, pictured, was the centre of campaigns against the military-backed interim regime . She admitted that her siblings had been involved in protests, but insisted that they were peaceful, adding: 'The people want democracy and other people want a coup. People in Egypt want democracy.' Tear gas was fired and heavy gunfire was heard before the mosque, in the Ramses area of Cairo, was cleared on Saturday. The Halawa siblings have made no direct contact with their family since. It is understood their mobile phones were seized. The . Irish Department of Foreign Affairs has said it continues to work . closely with counterparts in Egypt in a bid to secure the safe release . of the family. The Halawas had travelled to Egypt earlier this summer for a holiday and were joined by their mother a fortnight ago. They . were forced to seek sanctuary in the Al Fateh mosque on Friday after . violent clashes between supporters of ousted president Mohammed Morsi . and the security forces killed around 80 people. More than 800 people have died in the carnage that has followed a military crackdown over the past five days. Lockdown: Much of Cairo has been flooded with armoured vehicles and soldiers in a crackdown on protests . Army: Soldiers have been accused of massacring protesters demanding Mohammed Morsi's reinstatement . Hussein Halawa emigrated from Egypt to Ireland nearly two decades ago, and is now the imam of the Islamic Cultural Centre of Ireland in the Clonskeagh district of Dublin. Joe Costello, a minister at the Department of Foreign Affairs, today said that the siblings were 'in good health' and had made contact with a Turkish diplomat. The siblings will be taken to a prosecutors' office in Cairo this afternoon, with a representative from the local Irish Embassy. 'We will find out today what the attitudes of the authorities are towards the Halawas and we will be able to inform their father and sister back in Ireland,' Mr Costello said. 'It's good news that the Turkish diplomat spoke to them as late as yesterday and it's a relief to hear that they are in good form and that they have been kept together. 'That was a big concern, that they may have been separated. But we'll find out the attitude of the authorities today and we'll move from there.' Protests: Cairo has been wracked with violence since the deposition of president Mohammed Morsi . Confrontation: A soldier holds back the crowds outside Al Fateh as Islamists leave the mosque building . William Hague today admitted that the outlook for Egypt is 'very bleak' and said that Britain's influence in the region was 'limited'. The Foreign Secretary added that the events across the Middle East would echo for decades, but said he was optimistic about the future of democracy in the region. 'It is a very bleak situation, it is hard to under-estimate the hate and distrust on both sides of the politics in Egypt,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'But I would not accept there is nothing at all we can do about it. Our influence may be limited - it is a proudly independent country - and there may be years of turbulence in Egypt and other countries going through this profound debate about the nature of democracy and the role of religion in their society. 'We have to do our best to promote democratic institutions and political dialogue and to keep faith with the majority of Egyptians who just want a peaceful and stable country.' Mr Hague added: 'What is happening now in the Middle East is the most important event so far of the 21st century, even compared to the financial crisis we have been through and its impact on world affairs.' Tory MP Crispin Blunt criticised the UK Government's 'inadequate' response to the situation - and called for asset seizures and the dismissal of the Egyptian ambassador. Mr Blunt, who has visited the country twice since the military-backed removal of Mr Morsi, accused Mr Hague of failing to understand the gravity of the events or to stand up for British values.","Ibrihim Halawa was arrested at a mosque on Saturday with his three sisters .

The rugby league club, the East Woy Woy Roosters, where Mr Jackson is a long time member, have thrown their support behind the grieving father. Football manager Frank 'Junior' Johnson says the club is stunned and saddened by Lauren's passing. 'It's such a tragedy and to make it worse, he did his achilles tendon two months ago playing football helping out a mate. He was on crutches and lost his job in the mines and was struggling, battling with four children.' he said. 'He also hasn't got a car at the moment so all the football boys have chipped in. We have all (the club) rallied together and Central Coast rugby league are also letting us pass around buckets on the weekend to help raise funds to help a mate out.'

'The football club are hoping to help raise enough funds to pay for the funeral on Wednesday at Palmdale at 2:30pm.' Mr Johnson says Jason has been part of the Woy Woy club for about six or seven years and plays second or open age grade. He described Lauren as a lovely person who always had the children immaculately dressed. 'The girls always had ribbons in their hair. She was a caring lady, beautiful person.' he said. 'Jason was a bit of a scally-wag before he quietened down and had kids and nothing is ever too much trouble, he is a great father.' The Club is presently working on various fundraising initiatives to support Jason and his daughters in the longer term, however are also urging anyone who is willing to make a donation to help with the girls immediate needs. 'We have had a lot of people donating memorabilia to auction off at a fundraising night November 1st at the Woy Woy leagues club.' Mr Johnson said. 'Country rugby league is also helping.

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . Ministers have handed out billions in foreign aid even after being told that much of it is being wasted, it can be revealed. Since the election, the Department for International Development (DfID) has given £3.3 billion to 12 organisations that offer ‘poor’ or ‘average’ value for money. Five have been judged by civil servants to offer ‘poor’ value for money. The other seven, including the European Commission, are deemed ‘average’. Shockingly, DfID has increased funding for five of the groups. The revelation will further anger Tory backbenchers who vehemently disagree with David Cameron’s decision to give 0.7 per cent of the country’s output in aid. Since the election the Department for International Development has handed out £3.3 billion to 12 organisations deemed to offer'poor' or 'average' value for money, civil servants have judged . They say it is unfair that British people are suffering cuts to public services and defence budgets while money is being poured into ineffective multilateral bodies. Yesterday it emerged that Britain spent £10.6 billion on overseas aid in 2013, an increase of 28 per cent on the previous year. We are second only to the US in terms of development cash being handed out. Conservative MP Peter Bone said: ‘Because they are so determined to meet the 0.7 per cent target, there has been no time to hand out money based on need. 'So they have been in a rush to give it to organisations that are below value for money – and that’s just crazy. 'The best way to get value for money is to give funds directly to charities and not dole it out to organisations. Aid policy is now based on targets, not need, and that's disappointing' - Peter Bone MP . ‘The best way to get value for money is to give funds directly to charities and not dole it out to organisations. Aid policy is now based on targets, not need, and that’s disappointing.’ The biggest beneficiary of Britain’s aid budget is the European Commission, which has been given £2.4 billion in the past three years. Last year aid minister Alan Duncan said DfID was ‘forced’ to give a sixth of its aid budget to the EU and was powerless over how it was spent. Department civil servants criticise Brussels for giving too much aid money to middle-income countries, saying its results are ‘mixed’ and its procedures are ‘inflexible’. Robert Oxley, campaign director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Throwing taxpayers’ money at organisations that offer poor value is all too typical of a department more desperate to hit spending targets than ensuring it spends its budget wisely.’ Conservative MP Peter Bone (left) said the best way to get value for money is to give money to charities directly and not to dole it out to organisations. Last year Aid Minister Alan Duncan (right) said the DfID was 'forced' to give a sixth of its aid budget to the EU and was powerless as to how it was spent . In 2011, the Coalition ranked all organisations which receive money in terms of whether they offered ‘very good’, ‘good’, ‘average’ or ‘poor’ value for money. In the first year of the Government, £1.07 million was spent with the 12 ‘average’ and ‘poor’ organisations. The next year (2011/12), this had gone up to £1.13million, while last year it was £1.09million. The total over the past three years has been £3.26million. 'I think we should actually be really proud of the fact we are leading on this' - Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg . One of the worst recipients in terms of value for money is the Food and Agriculture Organisation, to which we have given £96.9 million over the past three years – making us the world’s fourth largest contributor. The money was given despite DfID’s annual report attacking the FAO’s ‘cost consciousness, transparency and financial management’. Unesco got £55million, even though DfID is concerned about its high overhead costs and the fact that it needs to do ‘more work on transparency’. DfID has increased spending since the election on five of the groups: the Caribbean Development Fund, the Inter-American Development Bank, the United Nations Population Fund, the World Health Organisation and UN Women. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg defended the aid budget, saying a failure to help could lead to instability in Africa or Asia. He said the country 'should be proud' of spending money on 'some of the poorest... some of the most wretched countries' in the world. Pictured are refugees crossing the border from Syria into Iraq . A spokesman for DfID said: ‘The Multilateral Aid Review process, introduced by this Government, provides a rigorous assessment of the value for money of multilateral agencies and has been adopted internationally. 'If under-performing multilaterals do not improve against the reforms we set, we are prepared to take decisions to end our funding.’ Nick Clegg defended the aid budget on his LBC radio phone-in yesterday, saying failure to help could lead to instability in Africa and Asia, and an increase in migrants. He said: ‘I think we should actually be really proud of the fact that we are leading on this. ‘Spending money on some of the poorest countries in the world, on some of the most wretched communities in the world: it’s not just a sort of reckless act of charity; it is actually in our own interests.’","Department for International Development has given £3.3 billion to 12 organisations that offer 'poor' or 'average' value for money .

"By . Corey Charlton for MailOnline . A mass occupation of Hong Kong's financial district will go ahead as protestors threaten 'wave after wave' of protests in response to Beijing's decision to block open elections. China's legislature today ruled out allowing open nominations in the inaugural election for Hong Kong's leader, saying they would create a 'chaotic society.' However, democracy activists in the Asian financial hub responded by saying that a long-threatened mass occupation of the heart of the city 'will definitely happen.' Scroll down for video . Pro-democracy activists rally outside the Central Government Offices in Hong Kong . The protestors have now said they plan 'wave after wave' of protests to cause havoc in the central city . Pictured from left are protest movement founders Chan Kin-man, Benny Tai and reverend Chu Yiu-ming . In setting tight limits on how far electoral reforms can go in Hong Kong, Beijing issued its firmest reminder yet that it's still in charge despite the substantial autonomy it promised the city after taking control from Britain in 1997. The decision by the legislature's powerful Standing Committee sharpens fears that China wants to screen candidates for loyalty to the central government and is reneging on its promise to let Hong Kong's leader be directly elected by voters, rather than the current committee of mostly pro-Beijing tycoons. Benny Tai, a leader of the Occupy Central with Love and Peace protest movement, said: 'At this very moment, the path of dialogue has been exhausted.' His protestors have vowed to rally at least 10,000 people to paralyze Hong Kong's financial district - known as Central - to press demands for genuine democracy. The group will launch 'wave after wave of protest action' in the coming weeks 'until we get to a point when we launch the all-out Occupy Central action,' Tai told reporters. Thousands of people gathered in a park across from Hong Kong government headquarters this evening to protest the widely expected announcement, chanting slogans and waving their cellphones. Police officers stand guard in the city's financial district after protestors threaten to occupy the area . The protestors are angry Beijing has blocked open nominations for Hong Kong's inaugural leader election . Earlier in the day, Li Fei, deputy secretary general of the National People's Congress' Standing Committee, told a news conference in Beijing that openly nominating candidates would create a 'chaotic society.' Under the Beijing-imposed guidelines, a maximum of three candidates, each approved by more than half of a 1,200-member nominating committee, will be put forth to Hong Kong's 5 million eligible voters in 2017. The public will have no say in choosing candidates, raising fears of what some have termed 'fake democracy.' 'These rights come from laws, they don't come from the sky,' Li said. 'Many Hong Kong people have wasted a lot of time discussing things that are not appropriate and aren't discussing things that are appropriate.' Making clear that Chinese leaders intend to tightly control politics in Hong Kong, Li emphasized that candidates for the city's chief executive should be loyal to China's ruling Communist Party. 'He has to be responsible to Hong Kong and to the central government,' Li said. 'If Hong Kong's chief executive doesn't love the country and love the party, then that can't work in one country.' Under the principle of 'one country, two systems,' Hong Kong is granted a high degree of control over its own affairs and civil liberties unseen on the mainland. The city has been taken over by protests and pro-Beijing counter protests in recent months . Occupy Central said the plan to block the Central financial district was 'the last resort, an action to be taken only if all chances of dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice.' It said that 'the occupation of Central will definitely happen,' without specifying a date. Pro-democracy rally member Christine Chu said: 'The decision on the nomination committee is very hypocritical. 'This is not true universal suffrage, so we cannot accept this result. We will do whatever we can to fight for what we want.' Beijing's announcement comes after a summer of protests and counter-protests that have gripped Hong Kong, including a rally two weeks ago by pro-Beijing activists to denounce Occupy Central as threatening the city's stability. Leaders of the movement, pictured addressing a crowd, have said up to 10,000 people will occupy the city centre . Political tensions spiked in June when Chinese officials released a policy 'white paper' declaring that Hong Kong's 'high degree of autonomy ... comes solely from the authorization by the central leadership.' Many read the policy paper as asserting Beijing's dominance of Hong Kong's affairs and hit the streets and the Internet in protest. Occupy Central drew Beijing's rebuke by organizing an online referendum to bolster support for full democracy that received nearly 800,000 votes. Also Sunday, the incumbent leader of the nearby Chinese-controlled casino capital of Macau, Fernando Chui, was elected to a second five-year term by a Beijing-friendly committee even though 95 percent of 8,688 votes cast in a similar referendum were in favor of universal suffrage in 2019.","Beijing declares only pre-approved candidates can run for leadership .

"By . Martha Cliff . How do you eat yours? Wolf it down, spoon out the inside? Or simply tuck in using a pair of chopsticks? A Chinese takeaway in London is offering its customers a rather unique take on Cadbury's Creme Egg in the form of a deep fried wonton. Jeremy Pang, head chef at North London takeaway Zing Zing created the unique treat by deep frying the Creme Egg in wonton batter, creating a crunchy dumpling with a soft gooey centre. A North London takeaway, Zing Zing, is offering its customers the chance to try a Creme Egg wonton this Easter . The takeaway had a hit with an earlier wonton filled with Nutella and banana and are hoping that the £1 Creme Egg wonton will be equally popular. Restaurant boss Mark Schlagman says that their latest offering fits in with the restaurant's bid to offer an alternative to your average Chinese takeaway. 'We are trying to be a different kind of Chinese food delivery service, so we never use additives or MSG in our food. Restaurant boss Mark Schlagman, says the concoction is truly delicious . The wonton is prepared in a very similar way to a traditional dumpling . 'The idea of deep frying a Creme Egg is nothing new, but we think we're the first to put it in a wonton wrapper.' He continued to say that the egg was extremely tasty and not just an Easter gimmick. 'It tastes absolutely delicious and is best eaten with chopsticks, although I probably wouldn't recommend dipping it in soy sauce.' Mark Schlagman recommends eating the wonton using chopsticks . The wontons cost £1 each and contain around 300 calories . At an estimated 300 calories the novelty racks up almost double the calories of an average Creme Egg, and certainly isn't as light as a traditional wonton, at around 50 calories. The wonton is the latest Creme Egg recipe to join the list of Easter snack oddities on offer. Graham Eyes, a butcher from Southport, Merseyside, created Scotch Creme Eggs in a bid to entice more customers through the doors of his shop. The 53-year-old is renowned locally for his unusual concoctions and, after the success of last year's Cadbury's Mini Egg sausages, he was looking for another way to brighten up Easter. Graham Eyes created the sweet and savoury snack following the success of his Mini Egg sausages . His latest offering is a Cadbury's Creme Egg wrapped in sausage meat and flavoured with a variety of seasonings. Mr Eyes, who opened his first butcher shop more than 30 years ago, said: 'So far I have had mixed reactions from people about the Scotch Creme Eggs. 'Some of my customers can't wait to try them but other people think they just sound disgusting. Graham says that he thinks the Scotch Creme Eggs are really tasty . 'Personally I think they are really tasty, I really like them. They've got a really interesting taste. 'You've got the sweetness from the chocolate, contrasting with the chilli and lime that we use in the coating - but the flavours go really well together.' Graham has even considered those on a diet, and there is an offering without any breadcrumbs for slimmers. Sweet pizza Fiorentina . Create your own sweet Creme Egg pizza . INGREDIENTS: For the base: 375g flour, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 tablespoon caster sugar, 1  x  7g sachet of instant yeast, 2 tablespoons sunflower oil and 225ml warm water. For the topping: Half a jar of strawberry jam, 100g white chocolate, a small handful of mint leaves and a Creme Egg. HOW TO DO IT: Lightly grease a flat baking sheet. Combine the flour, salt, sugar and yeast in a large bowl before adding the oil and water and mixing to a smooth, pliable dough. Roll the base out into a thin circle and place on the baking sheet. Cook in a preheated oven at 200c for 20-25 minutes, then remove from the oven and allow to cool completely. Top the cooled base with jam, and grate white chocolate over the top using the coarse side of the grater so it looks like cheese, then finish with scattered mint leaves. Halve the Creme Egg and carefully scoop out the fondant, placing it on the pizza so it looks like a baked egg, with the yolk in the middle of the white.

"By . Snejana Farberov . A beloved 61-year-old psychology professor has been outed as a killer who murdered his family as a teenager and was committed to a mental hospital for only six years after being found insane. The bespectacled, mustachioed chairman of Millikin University’s department of behavior sciences in Illinois has been identified by a reporter from the Texas newspaper The Georgetown Advocate as James Wolcott, who murdered his parents and older sister in cold blood when he was 15 years old. Following the gristly murders, Wolcott had been found not guilty by reason of insanity. After spending six years in a psychiatric institution, he disappeared. Now and then: Dr. James St James is a well-respected psychology professor in downstate Illinois, has been identified as James Wolcott, who murdered his parents in sister in 1967 when he was 15 years old . Academic haven: St James has been teaching psychology at Millikin University in Decatur, Illinois, since 1976 . Wolcott later legally changed his name and went on to earn several degrees in psychology and start a new life in academia. St James' outing as a man who committed triple homicide 46 years ago shocked the community of  Millikin University - a Presbyterian school in Decatur with 2,380 students - but his colleagues and students have since come out in support of the professor. Despite calls for his resignation, the university released a statement saying that St James will stay on at the school and will teach classes in the fall semester. ‘Millikin University has only recently been made aware of Dr. St. James’ past. Given the traumatic experiences of his childhood, Dr. St. James’ efforts to rebuild his life and obtain a successful professional career have been remarkable,’ the statement to the American-Statesman read. St James declined to comment on the story, deferring to the university’s statement. Speaking of St James’ new life as a respected professor, Douglas M. Benold, who declared him insane during the trial in 1968, told the Chicago Sun-Times: ‘I think that’s wonderful, if it’s for real. Knowing his background, I’m glad he’s there instead of in Georgetown.’ Murder weapon: On the night of August 4, 1967, James Wolcott got high on airplane glue, grabbed this .22-caliber rifle and murdered his parents and sister in cold blood . Gristly: Wolcott walked into his mother's room and shot her in the chest, leaving her for dead . Innocent: Wolcott's second victim was his 17-year-old sister, Libby (pictured), who he shot in the face and chest . First victim: The rampage started with the 15-year-old gunning down his father as he was reading in the living room . Decatur City Council member Jerry J. Dawson, a former Macon County sheriff, said that St. James should have told the school about his past before joining the faculty. ‘I look at this from a law enforcement perspective, and I just have a problem with somebody who didn't disclose this information,’ Dawson said. ‘If I were a parent and my kids were going to Millikin, that's something I would want to know.’ As The Georgetown Advocate's investigation has revealed, in the 1960s, James Wolcott, a brilliant student and accomplished musician, lived in Georgetown, Texas – a small suburb of Austin - with his father, Dr Gordon Wolcott, a biology professor at Southwester University, his mother, Elizabeth, and his older sister, Libby. Terrifying: The large black velvet wall covering in Wolcott's boyhood room was painted with a skeletal face that seemed to stare at the viewer from the depths behind the wall . On the night of August 4, 1967, the 15-year-old got high on airplane glue, grabbed a .22-caliber rifle, walked into the living room where his father was reading and shot him in the chest. Wolcott then walked into the room of his 17-year-old sister and shot her in the chest and face. The bloody rampage, which Wolcott had apparently planned a week prior, concluded with the teenager shooting his mother and leaving her for dead. With his entire family shot, Wolcott stashed the rifle and ran outside, crying and asking passersby for help because someone had just killed his family. James appeared distraught and hysterical when police arrived, but when he was interview by a ranger, he confessed to the murders, describing each killing in detail. By way of a motive, the 15-year-old told investigators that he ‘hated’ his family. Wolcott was arrested and booked into the Williamson County Jail. His murder trial got under way in October 1967. The defendant, now 16 years old, was found to be competent to stand trial as an adult. Wolcott's defense was that he had known for a while that he was suffering from mental illness, which was made worse by his addiction to airplane glue. Doctors later diagnosed his condition as paranoid schizophrenia. Depositions presented during the trial showed that James believed that his family were trying to drive him mad, or destroy him. During his psychological evaluation, the teen stated that his mother chewed her food too loudly and that his sister had a really bad accent. In his talks with a classmate, James also mentioned that his father would complain about his long hair and would not let him go to a peace rally or wear anti-Vietnam buttons. At the end of the six-month trial, an all-male jury acquitted Wolcott by reason of insanity. He was admitted on February 2, 1968, into Rusk State Hospital, where he were to remain until he became sane again. Confession: After initially feigning shock over the murders of his family, the 15-year-old admitted to shooting his parents and sister, telling investigators that he hated them . Getting away with murder: After being diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia exacerbated by drug use, Wolcott was found not guilty by reason of insanity and committed to a hospital for six years . The son of James' defense lawyer told the paper that according to his father, one of Wolcott's psychiatrists at the hospital felt sorry for him and invited him to live in his own home. In 1974, Wolcott was released from the institution after being cleared by the hospital administrator. Six years after the murders, it took a jury 10 minutes to declare James sane. Now a free man, Wolcott inherited his slain parents' estate and received a monthly stipend from his father's pension fund. Two years later, James Wolcott legally changed his name to James St James and vanished. With an IQ of at least 134, James St James went on to earn a bachelor's degree, a master's degree and eventually a PhD in 1988. Dr St James joined the faculty of Millikin University in Decatur, Illinois. In 1997, the tenured psychology professor received a teaching award and later was offered the position of chairman at  the department of behavior sciences. Those who know the well-respected educator still sporting a hippie ponytail on campus say that his students consider St James 'cool,' and his classes get excellent reviews on social media sites. Face to face: A reporter from The Georgetown Advocate is seen meeting with the popular psychology professor to interview him about his dark past . Speaking to the TV station ABC7, Tosha Duzan said that St James was her first professor at Millikin, and that she learned a lot from him. ‘I have this mental image of this man that I've learned from. That hundreds and hundreds of kids have learned from,’ said Duzan, adding, however, that now she also has other images in her mind – the bloody crime scene photos from St James' home in Georgetown, Texas. Millikin student Jentry Grader told Chicago Sun-Times she still respects St. James and hopes revelations about his dark past will not ruin his life. ‘I feel comfortable with him,’ Grader said. ‘And I do not see him as a threat to anyone.’","On August 4, 1967, 15-year-old James Wolcott shot dead his parents and 17-year-old sister with .22-caliber rifle .

The pregnant wife of a Missouri crop duster pilot killed in a tragic plane crash has revealed that, just before his death, her husband heard their unborn baby's heartbeat for the first time. 'I'm so thankful for that,' said LeAnn Malone, whose husband Hollis Malone died August 20 while doing the work he loved. The 29-year-old pilot also left behind a 2-year-old son named Rylan when he died in the west Tennessee tragedy.

Over 2,000 people attended Malone's funeral, which LeAnn told KFVS is a testament to what a great man he was. 'He was the most loving caring, would do anything for anybody, full of life,' she said. She also said he died doing what he loved. 'Being a pilot is in his blood, he's a fourth generation pilot, and he had every intention of Rylan being a fifth generation,' Malone said. Unknown causes: Officials have not yet determined the cause of the west Tennessee crash . Born to fly: Malone was a fourth generation pilot who friends and fmily said had crop dusting 'in his blood' Investigators have yet to uncover a cause of the crash, which occurred in the community of Bible Hill. 'I wish I would have talked him out of going into crop dusting at times, but I didn't want to hold him back from his dream,' Malone told KFVS. 'And I wanted to be supportive - but I knew how dangerous it was.' Regardless of what happened, a mourning wife must now deal with the loss of the family's breadwinner as she prepares for the birth of their baby. Malone had no life insurance, so friends and family have started a GoFundMe  page in hopes of helping his family financially. 'If Hollis touched your life in even the smallest way I just ask that you would consider a donation in his name,' the page reads.

"By . Marielle Simon for Daily Mail Australia . and Emily Crane for Daily Mail Australia . and Kate Lyons for Daily Mail Australia . A 26-year-old drilling engineer is among the nine fly-in fly-out (FIFO) workers who have taken their own lives in the past year. Rob, whose surname has not been revealed, ended his life on a Queensland mine site in November 2013, while working a three weeks on, three weeks off roster in coal seam gas exploration for QGC. His partner, Christine, said FIFO's lifestyle and work pressures became increasingly overwhelming for Rob and by the end he felt like his 'brain had broken.' 'He had actually been trying to find a new job for months because we both agreed that no one can function like that,' Christine told The Courier Mail. Scroll down for video . FIFO worker Rob, who's surname not revealed, ended his life on a Queensland mine site in November 2013, while working a three weeks on, three weeks off roster in coal seam gas exploration for QGC . 'When he was out there, he worked 12 hours a day, every day, sometimes late into the night,' she said. 'He even slept and ate at the rig site and was on call 24 hours. He said it was a ""living hell""'. The couple had been dating for six years, after meeting at university in South Australia while Christine was on exchange from Canada. She said the expectation to work beyond his expertise facilitated Rob's stress but was eventually addressed once he spoke to his boss, who gave him extra resources. But his struggle with mental health was something Rob was too embarrassed to discuss, fearing it would affect his reputation at work. Paul Grogran, QGC human resources vice-president said free and confidential access to counsellors are available to employees. 'Safety is a regular feature of our conversations with staff and takes priority over everything else,' he said. Mental Health Commissioner Tim Marney told a public hearing on Wednesday that the apparent increase in FIFO suicides over the past 12 months was tragically not surprising. Another FIFO worker who suffered from depression, Rhys Connor, died on July 25 last year in his room at the Hope Downs mine site in the Pilbara in Western Australia . Suicide is the single biggest killer of people aged 15 to 44 years old, while the average age of a FIFO worker is 38, Mr Marney said. The FIFO workforce is also 80 percent men, who account for four out of five suicides. Another FIFO worker who suffer from depression, Rhys Connor, died on July 25 last year in his room at the Hope Downs mine site in the Pilbara in Western Australia. Mr Connor spoke about his experience in an interview for a government-funded project on miners released by his family on the anniversary of his death to raise awareness about the risks of isolation and depression faced by FIFO workers . The father-of-one had spoken about the cost of the FIFO lifestyle on his mental health and wellbeing just days earlier, urging those considering FIFO to 'rethink' their decision. Mr Connor spoke about his experience in an interview for a government-funded project on miners released by his family on the anniversary of his death to raise awareness about the risks of isolation and depression faced by FIFO workers. 'People do struggle up there with depression and at the moment I'm going through it,' Mr Connor said in the interview. He said that some workers 'drink every night' to cope with the lifestyle and named isolation as a key problem for FIFO-workers. 'You're in your room every night of the week. You just think about things. You think about your family and what they’re doing now... You miss your family,' he said. 'There are people out there what seem to be fine, and deep down they're not. People have got to realise that everyone's not OK.' For the families of fly-in, fly-out workers who have committed suicide, an inquiry into the mental health of Western Australia's FIFO workers came as a great relief. The decision came after the families spoke to The Sunday Times last week, calling for preventative measures for mental health in FIFO workers. But Christine hopes to see all states in Australia follow WA's lead, who said this is an 'industry-wide' issue. Senator Wang, of the Palmer United Party also reiterated the need for a national investigation. 'WA has launched an inquiry to examine the issues behind the tragic deaths yet the Federal Government has not done anything about it,' said Senator Wang. Alan Woodward, Executive Directive of Lifeline Research Foundation, conducted a study of mental health among 900 FIFO workers last year. He found that while FIFO workers did not experience a higher rate of mental health issues compared to the rest of Western Australian citizens, they did experience specific hardships relating to mental health. 'A key concern for us out of that study was often the attitude among the workforce that it was somehow soft to say that you're having troubles,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

"By . Alex Greig . A rival car service company says Uber has been using some less than ethical tactics to try and outmaneuver the competition in New York City. Gett, a black car service that launched in New York's competitive on-demand transport market this fall, claims Uber employees, fearful of its rival's growing popularity, ordered and cancelled some 100 Gett cars last week. More than a dozen Uber employees - including the general manager, a social media manager, community manager and an operations manager, were among callers identified on Gett's system. Competitive: Gett, newly launched in New York City, has apparently rattled competitor Uber, employees of which booked then canceled more than 100 Gett cars last week . Dodgy tactics: An Uber spokesman admits that its tactics may have been too aggressive but denies engaging in any denial of service attacks, saying employees canceled reservations only seconds after they were made . Gett CEO Jing Herbert told TechCrunch that the Uber employees would wait until the cars had almost arrived before cancelling their booking. Once the Uber employee had ordered a car, they then had access to the number of the car's driver. TechCrunch reports that an Uber worker then sent text messages to these drivers offering money to jump ship, a tactic the company has employed with another competitor, Lyft. A flyer distributed to Lyft drivers in San Francisco offered a $50 gas card, 100 per cent of fares until January 2014 and a $500 bonus for carrying 20 passengers before a certain date. Uber has not denied the allegations, releasing a statement on the Uber website acknowledging the attempt to poach Gett's drivers. 'Our local teams can be pretty determined when spreading the word about Uber and how our platform opens up new economic opportunities for drivers,' reads the statement. Gett-ing even: It is unclear whether Gett will take legal action over Uber's poaching ploy . It goes on to say that the . reservations were canceled only seconds after they were made and that . the company paid any applicable cancellation fees, though it does . acknowledge that the campaign was 'too aggressive.' Herman likened the incident to a 'denial of service' attack, saying the practice denied cars to legitimate customers. 'During . a very short period of time when we had a hundred cancellations that . took up a hundred drivers, those hundred drivers could have served a . hundred of our legitimate customers who weren't able to get a car or had . to wait much longer to get a car,' Herman told CNNMoney. San . Francisco-based attorney Drexel Bradshaw told CNNMoney that the company . could face legal problems for these type of practices. 'If . Uber employees intentionally diverted Gett drivers from legitimate . business by making phony calls, that is an unfair business practice, . illegal under California law,' he said. 'It is also an intentional . interference with Gett's business which makes them liable for money . damages.' Questionable practices: Uber co-founder and chief, Travis Kalanick, in an Uber vehicle in front of the Sydney Opera House and Sydney Harbour Bridge in Sydney, has never shied away from competition . The attempt to hijack Gett's drivers comes after Uber faced criticism over its price-surge model of business, which was likened by the New York Times to 'high tech price gouging.' The model, says the company, keeps supply in line with demand. The more demand for cars, the more passengers will pay. On New Year's Eve, Twitter was awash with indignant Uber customers who were charged up to eight times the regular fare for cars on the notoriously busy night. Jerry Seinfeld's wife Jessica Seinfeld tweeted that one night in December during a snow storm she had paid $415 just to drop her children off at their bar mitzvah and sleepover, respectively. Gett's model is similar to Uber - only there's no price surge. The company offers customers a payment structure and flat fares between neighborhoods regardless of the time spent in the car. Gett operates in 20 cities across the UK, Russia and Israel.","New York employees of car service Uber ordered and canceled more than 100 cars with rival company Gett last week .

"By . Marielle Simon for Daily Mail Australia . It's now home to 20,000 crocodiles and less than a dozen people, but a remote area on the border of Western Australia and the Northern Territory has been handpicked by an architecture company as the ideal location for a second national capital. Lake Argle in the East Kimberley, near Kununurra, was created by the block of the Ord River in the 1960s and could potentially be the habitat of 150,000 people if a new northern capital is developed on the shores. The top of Australia remains quite empty, with Cairns and Darwin dominating that region. Currently home to 20,000 crocodiles and less than a dozen people, a remote area on the border of Western Australia and the Northern Territory has been handpicked by an architecture company as the ideal location for a second hypothetical national capital . But now, Landscape architecture company Ecoscape, plans to utilize the vast area, creating an international airport which could connect the East Kimberley with Asian destinations like Jakarta and Hong Kong. 'We just thought here's a perfect opportunity and such beautiful scenery,' Ecoscape environmental scientist David Kaesehagen said. 'It's got industries around it, it's got mining and agribusiness, it's got a whole range of different industries which can attract and hold people, so the place itself has got such intrinsic beauty that works to glue people to place,' Mr Kaesehagen said. The need to more densely popular Australia's north has been a topic of discussion for a while, and now Lake Argyle is the perfect site, with plentiful amounts of water, land and sunshine. Lake Argle in the East Kimbereley, near Kununurra, was created by the block of the Ord River in the 1960s and could be the habitat of 150,000 people if a new northern capital is developed on the shores . But locals are not as enthusiastic about the proposal, insisting remoteness is the beauty of Lake Argyle. 'One side of me says we want to keep it remote, and we don't want an enormous city here, the other side of me says there are big advantages in bringing people into the area,"" said tour operator Greg Smith to ABC. He believes that it would be a challenge to find people willing to live in the northern part of Australia, with scorching temperatures. Mr Kaesehagen agrees with Mr Smith's comments, suggesting it is a government with a big vision that can make it happen. The need to more densely popular Australia's north has been topic for discussion for a while, and now Lake Argyle is the perfect site, with plentiful amounts of water, land and sunshine . In 2010, demographer Bernard Salt predicted by 2050 Australia will experience a population boom so a plan for a new city, like a Gold Coast of the west is necessary, The Age reported. 'It might be appropriate to look for a new city up north, in the same way that in the last 50 years we've created the Gold Coast,' Mr Salt said. In recent times, Western Australia transformed Karratha a small town in Pilbara into one of Australia's richest regional towns. Due to the mining boom, the city originally with one supermarket was completely transformed into a thriving town, with an average income of $87,000, reports International Business Times. Professor Hugo discusses Australia's approach in the '70s, where a new city was viable due to increased mobility and city infrastructure under pressure. 'Whether it's a new city or development in places less affected by climate change, such as Tasmania, or the northern parts of Australia, all those options have to be on the table,' he said.","An architecture company has chosen Lake Argle in East Kimberley as the ideal location for a new capital in Australia .

Just when you thought there were hardly any bargains left for property buyers, Prince Charles comes to the rescue. His Duchy of Cornwall estate is selling 45 acres of unspoilt countryside – complete with coastal views, a private waterfall and a listed building – all for £40,000. The former slate quarry, in an area of outstanding natural beauty in Trebarwith Valley near Tintagel, Cornwall, features an historic engine house and is a favourite with tourists and walkers. The site will go up for auction on September 18, with a guide price of £40,000 to £50,000. A Duchy spokeswoman said: ‘This land is nowhere near any other Duchy land – it doesn’t fit – and has been leased to the council since 2011. ‘The engine house is a listed building so any change of use or development will need permission but we have made a recommendation that it would still be a public right of way.’ The engine house – used to haul slate and pump water until 1890 – is a popular landmark and was lovingly restored by volunteers 40 years ago. It is the only preserved engine house in north Cornwall. However, Katie Semmens, of Clive Emson auctioneers, believes the plot could be developed. She said: ‘This is a glorious spot for not a lot of money. We’ve had calls from some very interested parties. Plots with a real Royal wow factor don’t come up every day. This could make a lovely home for the right person.’ But John Brooks, who lives just two miles from the site, said: ‘I would be amazed if anyone wanted to develop this land or even live in the engine house. It’s a ten-minute walk up a mountain from the nearest car park. ‘But I suppose it might appeal to someone with a Grand Designs mentality and very deep pockets. ‘It would be very sad if the community lost access. I walk my dog there. It’s a lovely spot.’ he engine house is a listing building within the estate and was used to haul slate and pump water until 1890.

Delany College at Granville, which is in a low socio-economic area with a diverse student population of as many as 38 different nationalities, and some with learning difficulties, collaborated with Telstra at the beginning of the year to introduce the new teaching approach. Instead of the 68 year seven students being split up into six different classes throughout a six period day - the students share the one open learning space with five teachers across the three 100 minute blocks of learning time each day.

The staff say they have witnessed pupils growing in their confidence as learners and are more articulate after just eight months into the new initiative which is more about engagement than test scores. 'Every learning experience is about getting the pupils to have an emotional connection to it because if the heart is excited then the mind always remembers,' Year Seven teacher Ivanka Rancic said. 'We don't have the behaviours most other schools would have in a year seven. So a lot of things have been eliminated through this process.' This term, the students are focusing on 'how do I find my voice' which involved writing scripts for a chat show as well as being an artist for a day. Ms Rancic said she could never have dreamed she would be supportive of such a program. 'Had you told me a year ago that I'd be like this I would have said no and I would have been adamant it would have been a no. But I've grown as a teacher, not only as a teacher but as a person. I've become a better mother,' she said. The students are also big fans of the new way to learn with Jamal SwalahMcdahroy, 12, saying he now enjoys attending school and thinking for himself.

"By . Louise Cheer for Daily Mail Australia . For 10 years, a Siamese cat living in New Zealand has been leading a double life with two different families. Now the two Wellington families caught up in the cat's deception are in talks to who gets custody of the pet. Known as Ming to the Alexander family and Cleo to the Smith family, the pedigree cat was bought by Alice Alexander and named Ming in 2000. He was named for his tendency to mingle and Ms Alexander said the family often got calls from neighbours telling them Ming was at their house. Scroll down for video . A Siamese cat has been leading a life of deception after living a double life as Ming to one family and Cleo to another . After moving to Strathmore - in southern Wellington - in 2005, Ming would disappear for extended periods of time before making his way back home, well-fed and not wearing his collar which bore his name and a contact number of the family. But soon he started disappearing more often and then the cat vanished all together in 2010 for four years, according to stuff.co.nz. Out of the blue, Ming re-appeared on the roof of Alexanders' glasshouse in May earlier this year after they had canvassed the neighbourhood with missing cat posters when he decamped. 'I picked it up and realised it was Ming. I was running scenarios through my head, wondering where he had been,' Ms Alexander said. To make sure he would not disappear again, she had Ming microchipped and bought him another collar. But he went missing again, this time turning up a month later with the hair shaved off his leg and it was obvious he had recently been to see a veterinarian. It was revealed Ming/Cleo was living with two separate families who live close to each other in the Wellington suburb of Strathmore . Ms Alexander concluded that someone else had been looking after him so the family put up more missing cat posters. A week later, another family contacted the Alexanders and soon it emerged their beloved cat had been living a separate life with the Smiths who lived nearby. The reason why Ming went missing for four years was because the Smiths had taken him with them when they moved away from Strathmore and the family had just recently moved back to the area. Glenda Smith had no idea the cat was owned by someone else until she came across one of the Alexanders' missing cat posters. Cleo - as he was known to the Smiths - was owned by Ms Smith's husband before they were married and he had taken the cat in after he thought he was a stray because it spent so much time at his place. 'Cleo is part of the family and been with us for nine years, we can't just push him away now. It's emotional for us too, he loves us and always come back,' Ms Smith told stuff.co.nz. The Siamese cat's future is still unclear as both families figure out who will get custody of the cat, with both saying they want him to be happy. 'It's so difficult, we love him so much and want him to be happy but worried the family will move. Ming is 15 years old now and deserves to retire. He shouldn't have to try and reclaim territory,' Ms Alexander said.","The cat was known as Ming to the Alexanders and Cleo to the Smiths .

The National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) has reported an $800,000 loss, despite producing some of Australia's wealthiest actors such as Cate Blanchett . Hugo Weaving, who starred in the The Matrix as Agent Smith (left) also graduated from NIDA . The chairwoman of NIDA Jennifer Bott told the publication the loss was greater than expected, and put the institution in a worse position than the previous year. Ms Bott also revealed that the four years prior saw a combined surplus of $1.5 million, in anticipation of a new business model which would be rolled out between 2012 and 2015. Contributing to the school's loss was a ten percent increase in the bill for staff wages to a total of more than $11 million, while an overhaul of the institute's courses and technology was also a factor in the deficit. Avatar star Sam Worthington is another of Australia's most successful exports who attended the school . Director Baz Luhrmann (pictured) and his wife, costume designer Catherine Martin are  NIDA alumni . 'There were additional financial costs associated with this increased activity, especially in terms of depreciation and increased casual salaries, which resulted in a larger deficit than anticipated', Ms Bott said. Among NIDA's celebrated alumni are renowned director Baz Lurhmann, his wife Catherine Martin who is Australia's most awarded Oscar winner, and actresses Jessica Marais and Judy Davis. Famous Australian faces who missed out on a spot at the acting school include Rachel Griffiths, who came to fame following romantic comedy Muriel's Wedding, a film that also starred Toni Collette who dropped out of NIDA during her second year. Australian actress Jessica Marais is another famous face who studied at the institute . Anthony LaPaglia of Without A Trace fame was also rejected from the prestigious institute. A former board member at NIDA Chris Puplick penned an essay back in 2012 criticising the institute's running and blaming mass staff departures on the mechanics of the school. Despite the unfortunate finances of the institution, Ms Bott said applications for NIDA were still on the rise, and it still held a strong place within the arts and entertainment industry. In 2013, the Hollywood Reporter ranked NIDA the eighth best drama school worldwide. They put the Juilliard School in New York City - attended by the likes of Kevin Spacey and Robin Williams - in the top spot.","The National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) recorded an $800,000 loss .

"By . Nazir Afzal For The Mail On Sunday . As the Chief Crown Prosecutor for the North West, I led the teams that brought the so-called Rochdale Grooming Gang to justice in 2012 for abusing up to 47 girls. My work saw me go up against not only the offenders, but those who tried to intimidate me for bringing abusers before the courts. They said I had given racists a stick with which to beat minorities – I said our communities should be carrying their own sticks. Far-Right extremists targeted me, too. I had made these British-Asian men pay for abusing vulnerable girls – but that damaged the racists’ narrative that all minorities are the same. To their hateful demands for me to be ‘sacked and deported’, I gave the simple response: I was born in Birmingham. Nazir Afzal, Chief Crown Prosecutor for the North West, pictured, said he does not care about the race of a child abuser as long as  they are stopped and brought to justice. 'Ethnicity is an issue not the issue' The network of prosecutors I lead has tackled grooming and child sexual abuse in England and Wales for the past two years. We are advising about hundreds of suspects while, at the same time, protecting hundreds of victims. In one operation alone by Greater Manchester Police there are 20 potential victims and 180 suspects. The problem we identified in Rochdale was that justice was prevented from being delivered because the credibility of the young victims was questioned. If we don’t believe a young, vulnerable girl, who will? The authorities and communities appeared to have turned a blind eye to the abuse of its children. The ethnicity of many of the abusers in Rotherham, Rochdale and other places is a matter of fact – they were from Pakistani or South Asian backgrounds. I do not care where they come from as long as they are stopped and brought to justice. I told Parliament in 2012 that the ethnicity of the perpetrators was an issue, not the issue. It was not the abusers’ race that defined them, but their attitude to women and girls. They targeted girls because of their vulnerability, and failings by those who should have safeguarded them. There is no excuse for what the abusers did, nor is there any excuse for the authorities to choose not to believe and protect them. Abdul Rauf, pictured, was one of the nine men found guilty of being part of the Rochdale child abuse ring . Responsibility for the abuse begins and ends with the criminals who commit these acts. There is, however, an individual and collective duty to report what you suspect and to act to protect these vulnerable youngsters. Yet now the Asian communities have woken up to the criminals in their midst. They recognise they can do more to stop this offending. There is, sadly, no community where women and girls are not at risk from sexual predators. The CPS has prosecuted people from over 25 countries, excluding those from outside the EU, for sexual offences and trafficking in the past three years. Abusers are of all nationalities, ethnicities and ages, though the vast majority are white British males. Tragically, another girl will have been abused in the time it has taken to read this article. Other children will have been targeted for future abuse. But we and others have learnt from the past. We cannot shy away from tackling child sexual abuse regardless of where it occurs and by whom. Multicultural sensitivity is no excuse for our blindness. I believe it is time for the criminals to be in fear.","Nazir Afzal was accused of 'giving racists a stick' to beat minorities with .

"By . Freya Noble for Daily Mail Australia . Eddie McGuire has weighed into the debate about Swans star Adam Goodes 'staging' Following cricketer Shane Warne's accusations that Sydney Swans star Adam Goodes 'staged' for a free kick during  Saturday night's AFL game, a few more people have weighed into the discussion. Warne also revealed he didn't know Goodes had been awarded Australian of the Year back in January and wrote 'who votes for that?'. Goodes pointed out Warne's former teammate Adam Gilchrist is head of the Australia Day Council. Collingwood president and Millionaire Hot Seat host Eddie McGuire, who is thought not to be on good terms with Goodes after a spat earlier this year, took Warne's side of the debate. He told Channel Nine's The Today Show on Monday morning: ''Adam Goodes has been staging for free kicks a bit this year and Warnie's weighed in with his two bobs worth.' 'It's become a part of his game that he just needs to eradicate. He's too good a player, he's the star of the game but he's been doing the Fosbury Flop far too often and he's been called on it,' McGuire said. Speaking about Warne having no idea Goodes was Australian of the year, Maguire also made the suggestion that the Swans star  may not have realised when he brought Adam Gilchrist into the conversation, he and Warne were not on speaking terms. 'Maybe Goodesey didn't realise that they don't speak to each other', McGuire laughed. Former Essendon footballer Matthew Lloyd held the same view and told the Nine Network he too believes Goodes, a dual Brownlow medallist, staged during the match against Richmond. 'He's better than that,' Lloyd said. 'It's something in the game currently that people are more and more aware of, and absolutely hate. 'I think it's something (Swans coach) John Longmire should say to him: ""pull up, just focus on the footy because you don't need to do that"".' 'Staging' or faking a fall in order to gain a free kick has been a contentious issue within the AFL over the past few year. It is equated to 'diving' in soccer. Speaking on Sunday, Goodes admitted he was disappointed at the commentary and scrutiny, but unswayed. Scroll down for video . During an AFL game on Saturday Former Australian cricketer Shane Warne made a bizarre admission on Twitter that he didn't know Swans star Adam Goodes was Australian of the Year . 'Until you've been out on the footy field and you cop what happens out there, it's hard for them to make judgement,' he said. 'It's disappointing from the players who are ex-players, because they've been out there. They know what it's like. 'Is it going to affect me or the way I play my footy ... definitely not. That's their criticism ... it doesn't bother me', Goodes revealed. It all began during a social media exchange at the weekend, when former Australian cricketer Shane Warne was talking sport with good mate and fellow cricketer Michael Clarke. During the AFL match between the Sydney Swans and Richmond Tigers on Saturday evening Warne accused Swans star Adam Goodes of staging, or taking theatrical dives in order to earn free kicks during the game. Goodes hit back on Sunday morning mentioning Warne's former teammate and fellow cricketer Adam Gilchrist . 'Come on tigers beat those Swans and make the finals. By the way, does everyone get annoyed when Adam Goodes always ""stages"" for free kicks ?' Warne wrote. Captain of the Australian cricket team and good friend Michael Clarke responded to his mate's comment with 'Goodes is a legend mate. Swans to win the flag champion.' Warne then replied to Clarke with the baffling admission that he was surprised to discover Goodes was awarded Australian of the year for 2014 - which was awarded in January, almost eight months ago. 'I think Syd or the Hawks will win the flag. Shocked as I just found out Goodes was Aust of the year, wow ! Who votes for that?' Warne wrote in a bizarre tweet. Some punters on Twitter attacked Warne (left) for not knowing about Goodes' title (right) Australian cricket captain Michael Clarke said called Swans star Goodes a 'legend' during the exchange . What followed was many puzzled punters asking what he meant by his comments, while other users were astounded he missed the news. One wrote to Warne 'So much respect gone for you. Use to like you but you're actually a flog. Can't believe I looked up to you as a kid.' Others joked that they thought the former cricketer's account to be a parody based on his recent comments, only to discover it wasn't. On Sunday morning Adam Goodes responded to the exchange as he pointed out that Australian cricketer and one of Warne's former teammates Adam Gilchrist, is the head of the Australia Day Council. Goodes pointed out to Warne (left) his former teammate Adam Gilchrist (right) is chair of the Australia Day Council . Michael Clarke also responded that Shane Warne could be the next Australian of the Year . '@ShaneWarne thanks for your support mate maybe ask @gilly381 who votes for it he is the chair of the Australia Day Council'. Goodes wrote. Warne then repeated his initial advice for Goodes to stop diving, and wished the Swans star luck for the upcoming finals. '@adamroy37 Just stop staging for free kicks mate. You should be better than that as Aust of the year !!! Good luck in the finals', Warne tweeted. Some twitter users threw their support behind Warne over the strange sentiments, while many other people were astounded by the comments made by the former cricketer. One user commended Goodes on his response and wrote: 'Well done Adam, so tired of ppl (people) undermining your achievements'. Warne ended the conversation with the same comment he began it with - about staging during the match .","Collingwood president Eddie McGuire weighed into the debate about Swans star Adam Goodes 'staging'

"By . Jennifer Newton for MailOnline . Married BBC presenter Paul Ross has confessed to a gay affair with a man he met at a dogging spot after becoming hooked on the drug meow meow which he snorted off the man's face. The 57-year-old, who is the older brother of chat show host Jonathan Ross and a father-of-five, has admitted to cheating on his wife of 10 years with former English teacher Barry Olivier. But despite the affair, Jackie, who married the presenter in 2004, says she is sticking by him, saying she is not ending a 14 year relationship over a 'six months of madness'. Scroll down for video . Paul Ross, pictured in happier times with his wife of 10 years Jackie, who is sticking by him despite his affair and drug use . Ross met Mr Olivier at a known dogging spot in a secluded area near the Thicket roundabout in Maidenhead, pictured . Ross, who is best-known as the breakfast presenter on BBC Radio London and his appearances on ITV's This Morning said he was looking for an escape after facing financial ruin, which led him to look for casual sex on the Internet. After visiting a dogging site near to the Thicket roundabout in Maidenhead, he then met Mr Olivier, a father-of-four and began an affair, with them regularly meeting up at his flat in the Berkshire town and continuing to take the drug, also known as meow meow. Paul Ross was born in Leytonstone, east London in 1958 and is best-known as a TV and radio presenter. His onscreen break came on current affairs show Eyewitness before appearing on Channel 4's the Big Breakfast. He has also appeared as a contestant on reality TV shows such as Celebrity Fit Club and celebrity diving show Splash! Ross is the current co-host of BBC Radio London's breakfast show and appears regularly on ITV's This Morning. He is the older brother of chat show host Jonathan Ross, who has enjoyed more high profile success and fortunes than his sibling. He hosted Friday Night With Jonathan Ross on the BBC before joining ITV, where he now presents chat show The Jonathan Ross show. The older Ross has said he was too proud to ask for help during his financial troubles from his wealthy brother. Their mother is actress and radio presenter Martha Ross, who worked as an extra on EastEnders. But her contract was terminated in 2006, when she is said to have told Paul one of the show's Christmas storylines, which leaked on one of his radio shows. He also has three other brothers and a sister. Ross told the Sun on Sunday about the first time he tried the drug saying: 'We went back to his . There was some white powder on his kitchen top with some strawa and then he took a couple of hits of this stuff. 'I was on telly in the Eighties and drugs were all around and I never tried them. Anyway, so I tried this stuff and then we had sex and it was just incredibly intense. It was all about the drugs.' Mr Olivier claims that the presenter, with who he used the pet names Puck and Pea, would often drive to his flat to snort mephedrone and have sex before starting his radio show. However, Ross has strongly denied taking drugs before presenting the show. Mrs Ross found out about her husband's affair after tracking down his phone using an app on her iPad and went round to the flat but nobody answered. The star then confessed to his wife about his drug used but it was only ten days ago that Mr Olivier got in touch to reveal the full extent of the affair. But Mrs Ross also told the newspaper: 'I know 90 per cent of Paul is a good man. He's a good dad. I feel the sex was part of the mephedrone package, I don't see it as a gay relationship, I see it as part of the drugs.' Ross, who co-hosts the BBC Radio London breakfast with Penny Smith, has previously spoken about how his fortunes, which have been rather more mixed than his younger brother Jonathan, which in the most part has been dictated by his relationships. He has two divorces behind him and five children by his two former wives. Ross with co-host of BBC Radio London's breakfast show, Penny Smith, left. He has denied using drugs before presenting the show . The financial fortunes of Ross, have been rather more mixed than his younger brother, chat show host Jonathan . In 2011, he spoke about selling his 600-year-old timber-framed property in the village of Bisham, near Marlow, Buckinghamshire, for £579,950 . He said at the time: 'We're under no pressure to sell – the next house will probably be our last move so it's got to be right. 'We no longer need so many bedrooms as the girls don't tend to stay all at once any more,' said the presenter, who grew up in Leytonstone, east London, with his five younger siblings, who all work in the media. The BBC has announced that Ross will not be presenting his show tomorrow morning to 'deal with his issues' and is expected to be off air most of next month. A spokesman for the BBC said: 'Paul has spoken about his personal problems at length. He will be taking some time off to deal with those issues and won't be on air on Monday.'","57-year-old admitted to cheating with former English teacher Barry Olivier .

"By . Amy Ziniak for Daily Mail Australia . Aussie hopeful Nick Kyrgios has set a cracking pace in his third round at the US open, but just couldn't hold on to bow down to a game veteran in a thrilling five set match. Crafty Spaniard Tommy Robredo was victim to some explosive tennis early on, but fought hard to send the 19 year old ace crashing back to earth with a third-round elimination at New York. Robredo overcame a blistering pace from Kyrgios to grind out out a 3-6 6-3 7-6 (7-4) 6-3 victory that leaves Casey Dellacqua as Australia's lone singles survivor at the final grand slam of the year. Nick Kyrgios returns the ball to Tommy Robredo on day six of the US Open. The 19 year old set a cracking pace early on but was unable to hold off veteran Tommy Robredo . Kyrgois produced some explosive tennis early on, but spaniard Tommy Robredo fought hard to send the 19 year old ace crashing back to earth with a third-round elimination at New York. Kyrgios lit up Arthur Ashe Stadium and had former world No.1 Jim Courier gushing in the commentary box with a dazzling first-set blitz, but paid the ultimate price for underestimating Robredo's class and guile. The 32-year-old last year ousted five-times champion Roger Federer, and two days ago rallied from two sets down to defeat Simone Bolelli in the previous round. Not taking the court for their prime-time match-up until after 10 o'clock, Kyrgios started like a man trying to make a midnight flick. Blasting the veteran off the court, the youngster led 5-0 after barely 15 minutes and secured the first set before many spectators had even found their seats. 'Oh my, it's showtime already,' Courier said after Kyrgios broke Robredo early in the second set and then held with a spectacular 45-second service game. Spaniard Tommy Robredo overcame a blistering pace from Aussie Nick Kyrgios to grind out a 3-6 6-3 7-6 (7-4) 6-3 victory . 'This is really impressive stuff. This kid is having his way with last year's quarter-finalist.' 'Someone better go out there and ask him if he's even awake. This is what we call a dream-like state. This is the zone right now.' 'This is a tremendous athlete playing tennis and you're seeing the full arsenal.' said Courier. But from 2-0 and three more break-point chances up in the second set, The Wimbledon quarter finalist lost his way, dropping his monster serve twice to allow the 16th seed back on level terms. The third set went on serve all the way until a pivotal tiebreaker. After trailing 3-0, Kyrgios recovered to lead 4-3 before losing his cool and smashing his racquet in fury after dropping both his next two points on serve as Robredo snatched the breaker and the set. Bidding to become the first teenager in six years to make the men's last 16 at Flushing Meadows - and to also overtake Lleyton Hewitt as Australia's new No.1 - Kyrgios was unable to muster any fourth-set fightback. Kyrgios was then broken to love on his first service game as Robredo charged to a 3-0 lead. There were no more breaks back as Robredo served out the contest to love, after a staggering two hours and 28 minutes.

"By . Sarah Michael for Daily Mail Australia . David Morrell, director of buyers' agency Morrell & Koren . Foreign investors are illegally buying premium property in Australia's most expensive suburbs and are pricing locals out of the market, a leading buyers' agent has claimed. David Morrell said foreigners who did not meet residency requirements were being aided by local real estate agents and lawyers to buy large amounts of property in well-heeled areas including Toorak and Hawthorn in Melbourne's inner-east and Mosman on Sydney's North Shore. He also claimed the Financial Investment Review Board (FIRB) was doing nothing to stop them, and that real estate agents and lawyers were turning a blind eye because they were profiting from the sales. Mr Morrell, director of buyers' agency Morrell & Koren, said the investors who were predominantly from mainland China were willing to pay well above market value just to secure property in wealthy suburbs. In his submission to a parliamentary inquiry into foreign investment in residential real estate, Mr Morrell said he had witnessed a recent Toorak auction where the reserve was exceeded by 30 percent. 'There were three Chinese nationals competing, neither spoke English or understood the process and literally just kept their hands in the air,' he said. Mr Morrell told Daily Mail Australia: 'It was great for the vendor they got a big free kick but it was surreal. It was like the auctioneer taking money off the tree it was just silly. Mr Morrell claims foreign investors are illegally buying premium property in Australia's most expensive suburbs, including Sydney's Mosman (pictured), and are pricing locals out of the market . 'The frustration I'm hearing from my clients is we're not competing on equal terms. 'If they start getting free kicks like that all the time then the market really gets out of control.' Mr Morrell said the issue was affecting two segments of the property market in particular – high-end properties worth more than $10 million and inner-city properties worth between $1.5 million and $3 million. 'It's a domino effect because if someone down street sees a house sell for $12 million when it's only worth $9 million then someone else with a $9 million house suddenly thinks it's worth $12 million,' he said. 'There are also first home buyers trying to get in the inner city and all these apartments are being sold to people offshore. 'We're going to be looking at a generation of renters.' Mr Morrell said foreigners who did not meet residency requirements were being aided by local real estate agents and lawyers to buy large amounts of property in well-heeled areas including Toorak and Hawthorn in Melbourne's inner-east and Mosman on Sydney's North Shore (pictured) Foreigners must have residency in order to buy property in Australia, but Mr Morrell said the FIRB relies on estate agents to report any wrongdoing, and Mr Morrell claimed the agents were turning a blind eye because of the higher commissions they were receiving. 'The big problem is the vendors and agents aren't going to stop it because they want more money,' he said. 'Lawyers are not going to dob their own clients to the FIRB.' He said current rules were sufficient but they needed to be enforced properly, and labelled the FIRB a 'toothless tiger'. 'They haven't got the resources to investigate and even if they do it's a slap over the face with a wet lettuce,' he said. Mr Morrell said proposals to impose extra stamp duty on foreign buyers would do little to discourage the investors. 'Some people will just see that as the cost of doing business in Australia,' he said. Nicholas Proud, executive director of the Residential Development Council, said he opposed charging foreign investors with extra stamp duty. 'The first thing that should change is rules should be enforced,' Mr Proud said. 'We can see foreign investment has been positive but where there are concerns the rules aren't being enforced or activity is having an effect on the market we need to understand that. 'Most people would say the FIRB needs to collect additional detail, I think everyone is in agreement that there needs to be greater amount of fact on the table.' Mr Proud added that the inquiry into foreign investment was a good thing. 'This shines a light on the fact that we don't know enough about the transactional detail of foreign buyers,' he said. 'We need to rectify that.' Daily Mail Australia has contacted the FIRB for comment.","David Morrell says foreigners who do not meet residency requirements are illegally buying premium property in Australia's most expensive suburbs .

"By . Snejana Farberov for Mail online . For Dave Lacey, it seemed like he lost his wife, Erica, twice: first when she succumbed to a rare form of cancer at the age of 30, and then when a camera containing her final photos was stolen by burglars. The Santa Ana, California, man was devastated when he came home one day in 2012 to find his house ransacked and his valuables gone. But the young widower did not care about his missing Xbox and other items because the thieves had taken his most prized possession of all - his late wife's Canon camera. Tragic couple: Erica and Dave Lacey pictured on their wedding day in 2009 - two years before the bride's death from a rare form of lymphoma. A year later, burglars broke into the couple's home and stole Erica's camera . True love: Erica Werdel-Lacey was diagnosed with cancer just weeks before walking down the aisle . The electronic device contained photos from Erica Werdel-Lacey's wake and funeral taken in 2011 shortly after her death. ‘It just didn't seem fair, because after all that we went through, to lose those, it was like a punch in the gut,’ he told CNN. Mr Lacey was supposed to back up the images on his laptop, but they were too gut-wrenching for him to view at the time, and he was waiting for the right moment to face them. Erica Werdel-Lacey lost her life to cancer in December 2011, not long after celebrating her 30th birthday with her husband of two years, Dave. The couple met at work and dated casually before entering a committed relationship in the late 2000s. Eventually, Erica and Dave got engaged and began planning their wedding, which was shaping out to be a large-scale event with some 200 guests. Busy with wedding preparations and her career in marketing, Erica at first ignored what she thought to be a pesky cold, but when her symptoms persisted, she heeded her doctor’s advice and underwent a full CT body scan. Just weeks before the couple were to walk down the aisle, the results of the test came in: Erica had two large tumors in her chest and behind her diaphragm. The diagnosis was devastating: the 28-year-old bride had an aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Fading away: Despite several rounds of chemotherapy, Erica's cancer mutated and spread . Adding insult to injury: Dave Lacey thought he will never see those heartbreaking yet priceless images from his beloved wife's wake and funeral after the home invasion - but he was in for a surprise . Against all odds: Police in Santa Ana, California, were able to track down the Canon camera containing Erica's final photos . Erica's doctors suggested that she delay the wedding to focus on her treatment, but Erica would not let the illness stop her from marrying her beloved fiance. In the couple's wedding photos, the dazzling brunette is seen wearing a skin-colored bandage on her left arm concealing a temporary portacath. In the first year of Dave and Erica’s life together, her cancer seemed to be retreating, but the pitiless disease came back in 2011 with a vengeance, spreading to the newlywed's blood and bone marrow. Knowing that the end was near, the courageous young woman picked up photography, taking pictures of their dogs and documenting fleeting moments of happiness. When Erica lost her battle with cancer on December 7, 2011, her and Dave's family and friends came together to say goodbye to the vivacious young woman. With Erica's old Canon in hand, Dave Lacey snapped hundreds of pictures at her wake and funeral with the intention to eventually preserve them on his laptop. Then a year later, a pair of burglars broke into the Laceys' home in Santa Ana and raided his shelves, unwittingly picking up the Canon with the 300 priceless pictures from Erica's funeral along with other valuables. Fortunately for Mr Lacey, he had a tracking app installed on his iPhone, which helped him trace his stolen computer to an apartment in Santa Ana. Lacey contacted police with that information, and detectives Paul McClaskey and Jerry Verdugo wasted no time driving down to the address, where they discovered the widower’s missing desktop. The officers arrested David Aguilar and his girlfriend, Monica Molina, on burglary charges in connection to a series of home invasions. Heartless thieves: David Aguilar and Monica Molina pleaded guilty to a series of burglaries, including Dave Lacey's, and were handed jail sentences . Aguilar was eventually sentenced to 120 days in jail and three years’ probation, while Molina got 30 days in jail. While searching the burglars’ home, the detectives discovered a stack of pawn shop slips, which allowed them to recover two dozen stolen items - among them a Canon camera with a distinctive hand-stitched shoulder strap. When Detective McClaskey switched on the device, he found photos chronicling the funeral of a young woman and a somber gathering held at a private house. ‘As I started thumbing through it, it was apparent that it was a camera that was special,’ McClaskey’s partner, Mr Verdugo, recalled. The photos held no virtually clues to help police identify the owner of the camera, but in one of the snapshots Detective Verdugo noticed a blue house next to a familiar beige wall located on the northeast side of Santa Ana. Armed with a lead, the partners headed down to the area and began driving around the neighbourhood in search of the blue house depicted in the wake photos, but to no avail. Just as they were about to call it quits, the detectives ran into a neighbor who told them that one of the nearby homes used to be blue before a renovation, and that it was recently burglarized. Reunited: Dave Lacey was stunned and overjoyed to get a call from police about his stolen Canon camera containing precious photos of his late wife . The neighbor also confided in the officers that the owner of the residence in question had lost his young wife to cancer.

"By . David Mccormack for MailOnline . The family of a 61-year-old father of four shot dead by cops at his New Mexico home on Wednesday are denying police claims that they were called to a domestic dispute and arrived to find the man 'suicidal' and brandishing a deadly weapon. John Rogers, a truck driver from Bloomfield, is survived by his wife Billie, their four children and 18 grandchildren. According to the police report, Bloomfield officers were responding to a domestic dispute at the Rogers home and when they confronted Rogers, who was armed.

He said he believes that friend called the Bloomfield Police Department. The family denies that Rogers was armed when he was approached by officers. She describes seeing two police cruisers stop outside the house while she was inside doing some cleaning. Her husband was in the garage working on his motorcycle, she said.

John Rogers was shot dead by police outside his home in Bloomfield, New Mexico . 'Why? Why did they kill my husband?' The two 'boom' sounds were both officers firing their weapons, claims Rogers son Jonathan. He said that New Mexico State Police detectives told him two shots had been fired, one by an officer using his sidearm, the other fired from a shotgun. 'They said there was a struggle, and the officer pulled out his gun and shot him in the head,' said Jonathan Rogers. 'While he was still gurgling, they put their cold, steel boots to his neck.'

"By . Ian Drury for the Daily Mail . Only 140 new Army reservists have been recruited this year – despite the Ministry of Defence spending millions on an advertising campaign designed to persuade thousands to sign up. The poor figures dramatically underline the crisis Defence Secretary Michael Fallon is facing to push through the Coalition’s controversial cost-cutting reforms. Under the Armed Forces shake-up, ministers are cutting the strength of the regular Army by 20,000, while doubling the Territorial Army – now called the Army Reserve – to 30,000 by 2020. Scroll down for video . Military chiefs spent at least £2 million on a television advertising campaign to try to persuade thousands to sign up as part-time soldiers, but only 140 new Army reservists have been recruited this year . But the latest MoD statistics reveal that the number of trained reservists rose in the first six months of the year from 19,150 to 19,290 – an increase of just 140, or 23 a month. At this rate, it would take 39 years to meet the 30,000 target. Military chiefs had spent at least £2 million on a television advertising campaign to try to persuade thousands to sign up as part-time soldiers – working out at a cost of around £15,000 for each of the 140 new recruits. The figures emerged ahead of the Nato summit in Wales this week where Western military allies will discuss the threats posed by Russian aggression in Ukraine and jihadist fighters in the Middle East. The Coalition has faced warnings that sacking full-time troops before having enough reserves in place is hampering Britain’s ability to respond militarily to situations. The Territorial Army (here pictured at a presentation ceremony at Prince Charles' private Scottish home, Birkhall) are now called the Army Reserve under the Armed Forces shake-up . Tory MP John Baron, a former Army officer who has led criticism of the reforms, said: ‘We live in an increasingly uncertain world. We see more money being spent on armed forces by countries who are not necessarily friendly to the West. ‘This should be a wake-up call to the West that we need to spend more money on our forces. With the military, Britain has not cut just to the bone, but into the bone.’ Mr Baron pointed out that reservists cost more to train and deploy than regular soldiers – undermining the potential savings expected by the MoD. He warned that if top brass failed to recruit enough troops the shortfall could jeopardise Britain’s security. In June, ministers announced 1,060 troops were being made redundant – the last of four rounds of job cuts that has left the regular Army at its weakest since before the Napoleonic wars more than 200 years ago. The National Audit Office also criticised the MoD over proposals to slash the regular army and warned recruitment of part-time soldiers appeared to be five years behind schedule. And a report from senior officers this summer said the plans had made an ‘extremely poor start’. An MoD spokesman said: ‘The reserves are being rebuilt and we are investing £1.8billion in better training and equipment. ‘We are one year into a five-year plan and the number of people joining the Army Reserve over the last 12 months is increasing.’","Only 140 new Army reservists have been recruited this year .

"By . Associated Press . and Alex Greg for MailOnline . The mother of a Washington state boy who brought a gun to school that went off in his backpack and critically wounded a classmate will spend more than a year behind bars. Jamie Lee Chaffin, 36, was sentenced to 14 months Friday in Kitsap County Superior Court. She initially faced third-degree assault charges but was eventually prosecuted for unlawful possession of a firearm. She was convicted of forgery for trying to cash a stolen check in 2007 and barred from owning or accessing weapons. Sentenced: Jamie Lee Chaffin must serve a sentence of 14 months in prison for unlawful possession of a firearm . School shooting: She is not the legal guardian of her son, who brought a gun he found at her boyfriend's home to school in a backpack . In February 2012, the gun that Chaffin's nine-year-old son brought to the city of Bremerton elementary school fired inside his backpack, injuring eight-year-old Amina Kocer Bowman. She had multiple surgeries and spent more than a month in the hospital. Her parents say she remains physically and emotionally scarred by the incident, which nearly took her life. The boy told investigators he took the gun from a dresser at the home of his mother's boyfriend, Douglas Bauer, because he was afraid of other students. Chaffin did not have custody of her son, who lived with his uncle. The boy and his siblings testified that there were other firearms in Bauer's home that were not locked away. Accidental: The gun went off in the boy's bag and he was initially charged with third-degree felony assault . Seriously injured: Amina Bowman recovered from her injuries after month in hospital after being shot at school . Chaffin agreed in 2012 to testify against Bauer in exchange for the assault charge being dropped. She also agreed to plead guilty to unlawful possession of a gun, but her sentencing was postponed while Bauer's case wound through the courts. Her punishment moved forward after the state Supreme Court ruled in July that the third-degree assault case against Bauer could not proceed. Bauer watched Chaffin's sentencing Friday. Her attorney, Michael Clark, sought less than the 14 months recommended by prosecutors, saying she could not care for herself and was dependent on Bauer, leaving her with few options despite knowing guns were in the house. But Judge Leila Mills imposed the full year and two months. Gun owner: Douglas Bauer had guns in his home where young children could access them . ""I'm not finding there's anything to justify or excuse this behavior,"" Mills said. ""You were under orders not to have a firearm. It was a direct violation."" Chaffin declined to make a statement in court, saying, ""I'm not very good at speaking out loud with this many people around."" Clark submitted a letter from Chaffin's therapist saying she was the victim of abuse earlier in her life and was under 'duress' due to her dependence on Bauer. Neither her attorney nor Bauer offered additional comment outside the courtroom. Earlier this month, the Bremerton School District agreed to pay $900,000 to the family of the injured girl. Bauer's homeowner's insurance said it would pay an additional $300,000 in the legal settlement. Chaffin's son was initially charged with third-degree felony assault but made a plea agreement with Kitsap County prosecutors. He admitted responsibility for taking the gun to school and underwent a year of probation.","Jamie Lee Chaffin has been sentenced to 14 months in prison .

"By . Frank Coletta for Daily Mail Australia . and Aap . The report into the Royal Commission into the fatal Home Insulation program has been tabled in parliament and it's believed Kevin Rudd and senior ministers from the previous Labor Government will shoulder much of the blame for the failure. Four installers died during the $2.8 billion scheme, set up as part of the economic stimulus package in 2008-2009. The Federal Government established the $16 million inquiry soon after Tony Abbott became Prime Minister and it has now been received the long-awaited findings. Mr Abbott said the failures arose from 'a dysfunctional culture'. Scroll down for video . The roles of both former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd (left) and his former Environment Minister Peter Garrett (right) in the Home Insulation Program, came under close scrutiny during the eight-month Royal Commission . 'The government will carefully consider the findings and the recommendations of this report, which is a timely reminder of what can happen if government acts with undue haste,' Mr Abbott said. A preliminary response is expected by the end of September and a final response by year's end. 'The government's response will focus on ensuring that such a catastrophic policy failure never happens again,' Mr Abbott added. The inquiry was told of serious program flaws, limited training for workers and a lack of system of checks to prevent rorts. In May, former prime minister Kevin Rudd told the commission he accepted ultimate responsibility for the program's failings. Former Labor environment minister Peter Garrett, parliamentary secretary Mark Arbib and numerous public servants all had duties to monitor certain issues, Mr Rudd said, although he did not directly implicate anyone. The $16 million Royal Commission was established by Prime Minister Tony Abbott soon after the Coalition came into power. He has tabled the report in parliament calling the program 'a catastrophic policy failure' During his testimony, Mr Garrett said he accepted ultimate responsibility, as the person charged with rolling out the scheme. 'We share responsibilities with those other institutions that equally have them, such as state regulatory bodies, employers, ultimately employees as well,' Mr Garrett told the Commission. But he too said others should share the blame. Installers Matthew Fuller, Rueben Barnes, Marcus Wilson and Mitchell Sweeney died in 2009 and 2010, three by electrocution. The program was stopped on February 19, 2010. The Royal Commission was told: . On October 14, 2009, Matthew Fuller, 25, was electrocuted laying insulation sheeting in the ceiling cavity of a house in Meadowbrook, Queensland. He had started work with the company 12 days earlier. November 18, 2009. Rueben Barnes, 16, was electrocuted laying batts in the ceiling cavity of a house at Stanwell, also in Queensland. He had started with the company 21 days earlier. November 21, 2009. Marcus Wilson, 19, died from hyperthermia complications after installing insulation batts in a St Clair home in Sydney's western suburbs in 40C heat. February 4, 2010. Mitchell Sweeney, 22, was electrocuted laying insulation sheeting in the ceiling cavity of a home at Millaa Millaa, Queensland. He had started at a new company a week earlier. The Commission heard that the abolishing of the $2.8 billion scheme in February of 2010 ultimately destroyed many small businesses . On 29 March, Royal Commissioner Ian Hanger QC made a request for additional time to produce his report into the Home Insulation Program. The Royal Commission stated that 'this additional two months will enable Commissioner Hanger to thoroughly consider the large volume of evidence that has been received'. Since it was established on 12 December last year, the Royal Commission held 37 days of public hearings, where it heard from more than 50 witnesses, undertook over 120 interviews and issued 125 summons to produce documents. The Royal Commission also received 70,000 relevant documents in response to summonses, and further documents are still being received by the Commission. AAP reports that the inquiry heard former prime minister Kevin Rudd and his former minister Peter Garrett accepted 'ultimate responsibility' for the program, but said public servants failed to advise of safety risks. Bureaucrats were warned five months before the program's roll-out that three New Zealanders had been electrocuted using metal staples to secure foil. After the first death, industry advice that foil should be banned wasn't heeded. Senior bureaucrats said they were given two days to cost the scheme. Public servants believed the July 1, 2009 roll-out deadline denied them time to consider safety risks, but Mr Rudd said they should have asked for an extension. Plans to train all installers were abandoned, allowing workers to enter roof cavities after undergoing a general safety induction provided they were supervised. But the government had no way of guaranteeing on-site supervision. Mr Rudd controversially used details of secret cabinet proceedings to reveal that even after people started dying, bureaucrats advised the scheme was reportedly 'on track'. The program had attracted so-called 'shonky' operators who failed to supervise inexperienced installers and claimed payments for work that had never taken place. But the scheme's early termination also led to the financial ruin of established insulation companies, with some losing millions of dollars.","Eight-month Royal Commission report into the fatal Home Insulation Program has been tabled in parliament today .

Unlike most romantic proposals, Rochelle Collis wasn't wooed with a ring, instead Mr Moini surprised her and the guests, with a $1 million donation to charity - she said yes . It was the awfully romantic philanthropy gesture that had entrepreneur Babak Moini 'walking through the streets with a spring in his step.' On his partner's 40th birthday, Mr Moini, the founder of a chain of laser clinics, announced in front of a crowd of guests at the couple's Sydney home, 'Rochelle, I'd like you to change your Facebook status to ""engaged""'. Unlike most romantic proposals, Rochelle Collis wasn't wooed with a ring, instead Mr Moini surprised her and the guests, with a $1 million donation to charity - she said yes. In lieu of birthday gifts, Ms Collis asked her guests to donate to a charity of her choice, the FSHD Global Research Foundation. The surprise proposal came to a shock for everyone at the birthday party, besides the recipients of the donation, Natalie Moss and her father Bill, who suffers from facioscapulohumeral dystrophy. 'We had the biggest novelty cheque you'll ever see,' Ms Moss told Sydney Morning Herald. 'It was a beautiful birthday celebration for her, she was speechless.' But Mr Moini's generous gesture was not about the couple, rather his way highlight the need for philanthropy in Australia ""and saying no to excess wealth"". 'I was going to spend about $10 to $15 million buying a house and it just didn't feel right to me,' he said. 'I thought I would rather give the money away.' The couple met when Ms Collis was supplying botox and fillers to his clinics, and now they plan on setting up a foundation that will see them donate $3 million a year to charity. Mr Moini, father-of-three from a previous marriage, believes too many people wait until they are dead to give away their wealth. Ms Moss predicts that many Australians are hesitant to donate because they tend to associate the word ""charity"" with dirty.

"By . Louise Cheer for Daily Mail Australia . Convicted drug smuggler Schapelle Corby has been visiting the Bali home of Ben Panangian, who has been arrested for possession of marijuana, two to three times a week since she was released from jail, neighbours have claimed. Corby who was released on February 10 this year from Kerobokan prison in Bali is on strict parole conditions after spending nine years in jail. It was claimed this week that Corby and Panangian were not in a relationship after the two were pictured together in May and allegedly met in jail. Ben Panangian lives on the second floor of a South Kuta apartment on the Indonesian island of Bali . Ben Panangian - who is believed to be Schapelle Corby's boyfriend - has been arrested after police found marijuana in his possession . Behind the doors of Panangian's South Kuta apartment - south of Bali's capital Denpasar - a pile of men's and women's clothing were found . But the landlord at Ben’s rented apartment in South Kuta and a neighbour has told Daily Mail Australia that Corby visits Ben in the morning and afternoons at his house about two to three times a week. ‘She comes in the afternoon and leaves by the evening,’ landlord Myoman Yasa said. Arrested: Indonesian police allege Ben Panangian was in possession of marijuana . The neighbour, named Fitri, saw Ben being arrested on Wednesday night after two police cars pulled up in the courtyard. He appeared relaxed as they led him out of the room on the first floor of the apartment block. The police were holding a black bag, thought to be the bag of marijuana they found in his cupboard. The landlord gave Daily Mail Australia access to his apartment. Inside there was a double mattress on the floor, a red bean bag which had been torn open, an empty fridge and a cupboard that was full of neatly folded men and women’s clothes. A black and pink lacy g-string was just one item of woman’s clothing found in the wooden cupboard. The room also featured a small sink and stove, a water fountain and a small shower room where a bright pink sponge hung on the wall. Indonesian art adorned his bedroom wall, including two masks and a blue painting. Daily Mail Australia showed the neighbour and landlord recent photos of Schapelle and they confirmed that she was ‘definitely’ the woman they had seen visiting the house. The landlord said Ben had lived in the apartment block for three years and paid 700,000 Indonesian rupiah a month (64 Australian dollars) for the room. It costs Ben Panangian 64 Australian dollars a month to rent out the apartment (left) where a wardrobe full of clothes was found (right) Amongst the men's and women's clothing in the wardrobe, a black and pink lacy g-string was found . A surfboard bag and a double bed was found on a floor, along with a red bean bag . Panangian's landlord Ni Nyoman Yasa opened up his home and said he mostly kept to himself . Neightbour Fitri identified Corby from a photo and saw Panangian being arrested by police on Wednesday . He previously lived on a ground floor apartment in the modest complex but his friend now rents that room, they said. The two men often go surfing together and work in the same office but when Ben comes home he does not speak to his neighbours more than to say hello, the landlady said. ‘Ben is an introvert he doesn’t talk with neighbours he just comes and says hi and goes to his room,’ the neighbour added. She said a different ‘foreign’ woman used to visit the apartment but Schapelle began coming at the beginning of this year - once she was released from jail. In custody: Schapelle Corby's boyfriend Ben Panangian is pictured in orange prison scrubs marked with the number 99 and a balaclava at a police press conference . Schapelle Corby's boyfriend has been charged by Indonesian police after he was allegedly caught in possession of drugs in Bali . Schapelle Corby was released from a Bali jail in February after serving nine years for drug smuggling . Police have reportedly finished interrogating Ben now and he is being held at a police holding cell in Polresta in Denpasar. They seized his Honda Vario scooter when they arrested him, the neighbour said. Since his arrest, a friend has visited his room to pick up a surfboard and another friend came to pick up some clothes to take them to him in the police station, the neighbour added. The Indonesian boyfriend of convicted drug smuggler Schapelle Corby has been pictured in police custody after he was arrested for alleged possession of marijuana. Ben Panangian is shown alongside other drug suspects in photos taken at a police press conference wearing orange prison scrubs with a bizarre balaclava covering his face on Saturday.

"By . Tamara Cohen And Rob Davies For Daily Mail . Up to 100 Tory MPs are set to defy David Cameron by pledging to vote to leave the EU no matter how much power he manages to claw back from Brussels. Conservative Eurosceptics are planning to promise in their personal manifestos for next May’s General Election that they will vote for Britain to quit the EU in 2017’s in/out referendum. Such a move would be widely seen as a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister’s ability to win a good deal for Britain. Douglas Carswell (right with Nigel Farage) appears to be in line for a historic win in Clacton, where he sits as Tory MP . And it would echo the warning by Douglas Carswell, the former Tory MP who defected to Ukip last week, that Mr Cameron was not ‘serious’ about EU reform and wanted to recommend an ‘in’ vote. The newly elected president of the European Council, Polish prime minister Donald Tusk, said at the weekend that he would support key reforms demanded by Mr Cameron, including a crackdown on benefit tourism. But that would not be enough for the 50 to 100 Tory MPs planning to bring out the rebellious manifestos, according to Eurosceptic MPs speaking to the Independent. Mark Reckless, MP for Rochester and Strood, said: ‘My election manifesto will confirm my view that we should leave the EU.’ Meanwhile, a senior Tory says the party should not even try to contest the seat where Carswell is standing next month. Nigel Evans, the former deputy speaker, yesterday urged his party to ‘sit out’ the by-election in Clacton where the former Conservative MP, will now run for Ukip. It comes as up to three leading Tory Eurosceptics are reported to have started private talks about ‘non-aggression pacts’ in which Ukip would not run against them. The by-election, which a poll this weekend suggests Mr Carswell will win by a landslide, presents a severe dilemma for the Conservatives. Ploughing resources into keeping the seat would be expensive and some fear it would divert resources from other key seats to what could be a high-profile failure. Mr Evans, who described himself as ‘sort of’ a friend of Mr Carswell, told Sky News: ‘A part of me says we should sit this one out, it’s a total distraction.’ Michael Fabricant (left), a former Tory chairman who used to organise by-election campaigning, said it was his party’s ‘duty’ to fight every by-election seriously; Nigel Evans (right), the former deputy speaker, yesterday urged his party to ‘sit out’ the by-election in Clacton . He added: ‘I spent the day yesterday with 250 young Tories who feel desperately let down by Carswell. They do believe the only way we’re going to make headway is by having a referendum on Europe. ‘How are we going to do that? With the Tories and David Cameron winning in 2015. It really makes no sense to me at all.’ But Michael Fabricant, a former Tory chairman who used to organise by-election campaigning, said it was his party’s ‘duty’ to fight every by-election seriously. He proposed deals between the Conservatives and Ukip two years ago, but said the idea was no longer viable as many of Ukip’s policies, such as cuts to the NHS budget, ‘contradicted’ Conservative policies. He said: ‘We can’t say we are not going to fight it. We have to fight every by-election seriously. Conservative voters in Clacton will expect a serious campaign and we cannot disenfranchise them.’ It was claimed yesterday that MPs who want to cut ties with Brussels but are not prepared to join Ukip will defy Mr Cameron by forming their own ‘non-aggression pacts’ with the party. This could involve stripping their campaign literature of Tory logos and using quotes from Mr Farage on pamphlets — effectively running as joint candidates, the Sunday Times said.","Scores of MPs  to promise to vote to leave EU in future referendum .

"By . Lucy Thackray for Daily Mail Australia . An innocent 15-year-old girl, Leanne Walters died when she was shot in the face in broad daylight, when a Milperra carpark was turned into a savage battleground during the 1984 'Milperra Massacre.' The brutal battle remains the world’s worst ever outbreak of bikie violence – yet it was all for ‘nothing, really,’ according to the man many believe is responsible for the bloody showdown that claimed seven lives. Seven people were killed, 28 injured and 43 men charged with murder. That man, the founder of bikie gang the Comancheros, William George ‘Jock’ Ross insists he expected ‘nothing’ would happen that day, despite leading his heavily armed men to meet their arch rivals. Scroll down for video . 'We came to be seen, not to fight. We were armed only for defence,’ Ross told 60 Minutes, breaking his silence of 30 years. ‘(The Bandidos) attacked us, they had the choice. We didn’t have the choice. What was I meant to do, put my arms in the air and be cut to bits?’ This Tuesday marks 30 years since the horrific Father’s Day massacre, when two bikie gangs, the Comancheros and the Bandidos used guns, knifes, lead pipes and various other weapons to wreak havoc on a quiet suburb, invading a ‘part swap’ at Viking Tavern in Sydney’s south west. The case's crucial witness, Linda Motten, has come forward for the first time to tell her story – revealing the lasting trauma she experienced after witnessing the destruction of the bikie war. ‘It was just a family day that turned to hell,’ Ms Motten told 60 Minutes. ‘There were so many children there. People were throwing children over the fence. There was a pregnant woman lying in the middle of the car park.’ From underneath a car, Linda Motten took photos of the crime that were crucial evidence that led to the conviction of the bikies from the two gangs involved in the massacre . Ms Motten, who was 22-years-old at the time of the murders, was sitting in her car when the bikie gangs began their battle. She witnessed the scene unfold and provided the key witness account and only photographic evidence of the crime, which led to the conviction of 43 men. ‘The noise was incredible, not just the shots. There were people smashing each other with lead pipes, baseball bats, chains, anything. ‘People were screaming in agony. It all happened so quickly, you’d blink and there’d be three people lying in the middle of the carpark,' said Ms Motten. After Ms Motten’s windscreen was shattered by a bullet, covering her in shards of glass, she fled for safety behind a caravan. It was at that moment that she had the ‘clarity’ of mind to grab her camera and, from beneath a van, take photographs of the barbaric scene – with the explicit purpose of exposing those responsible. ‘I thought, “I’m not going to let them get away with this”’ ‘I tried to get photos of men with firearms still in their hands so I could later say, “that man shot that man with that gun,”’ said Ms Motten. The brutal scene was something that 'noting could have prepared us for,' according to Senior Constable John Garvey, who worked on the case and witnessed the shocking violence . She took seven photos which were damning for the suspects, who underwent a 13 month trial – the longest in NSW history. ‘It was the only weapon I had and I was going to shoot back,’ Ms Motten told 60 Minutes. Detective Senior Constable John Garvey witnessed the indescribable scenes and managed to finally stop the bloodshed. ‘Nothing on the trip over (to the carpark), nothing, could have prepared us for what we walked into,’ Constable Garvey explains. Constable Garvey worked on the investigation that put 43 of the bikies culpable behind bars. Ross received a life sentence but served only 5 years 3 months, as his murder charge was downgraded to manslaughter and his sentence was shortened due to good behaviour. Garvey is certain that Ross knew exactly what was going to unfold that fateful day, and believes the 71-year-old grandfather has blood on his hands today. ‘Jock Ross is a very intelligent, very calculating and very dominant figure who is responsible for what happened that day.’ Ross maintained his control of the gang during his time in jail, and only retired as their leader in 2003. He still wears his gang colours. Ross returned to the scene of the massacre for the first time since the killings with the program. Ross insists that when he arrived at the fateful car park, he did not expect for any violence to erupt, despite he and his gang all arriving heavily armed to meet with their arch enemies . Ms Motten says she no longer lives in fear after spending 25 years ‘looking over shoulder.’ She could not escape the horror of the bikie war, as bikies made threats on her life, leading to repeated moves and jobs changes, to remain inconspicuous. However, she knew she had no option but to expose the bikies’ crimes and every detail she could possibly recount during the trial. She believes the victims have been forgotten as time has passed. ‘It was important to remember the innocent people that were out there. I think the victims have been lost in this,’ Ms Motten said. For Leanne’s father, Rex Walters, his daughter will never be forgotten. He also spoke with 60 Minutes to honour his daughter’s memory. Mr Walters has been left with nothing, except the clothes his daughter was wearing on the day she was killed and the Father’s Day present, a photo frame, that Leanne had planned to give to Rex that day. Thirty years later, his mind still wanders. Looking at her clothes, he says ‘I can imagine what she would have looked like that day.’ For Leanne's father, there is no forgetting.","September 2 marks 30 years since the bloodiest bikie gang clash in Australia's history, the 'Milperra massacre'

"By . Freya Noble . and Sally Lee . and Marielle Simon for Daily Mail Australia . Former mining magnate and racing figure Nathan Tinkler will sell his assets in a bid to pay back debts . Following the repossession of his private jet and the revelation that he owes an Australian billionaire nearly $45 million, the extent of former mining magnate Nathan Tinkler's debt has again been revealed. Gerry Harvey, executive chairman of Harvey Norman, said the loans he gave to Tinkler began with a one-time sum of $12.2 million and every month or two since then he'd been handing out another few million. 'The debt kept getting bigger every couple of months,' Harvey told The Daily Telegraph. 'Instead of him owing the bank he owed me.' Harvey, who called it quits on handing money to Tinkler when the total almost tipped $45 million, said the mining magnate used to cash to pay Newcastle Knights players and coaches and bail out his businesses. Now, the Harvey Norman executive will sell off tens of millions of dollars worth of assets across NSW and QLD as well as more than 560 racehorses previously owned by Tinkler in a bid to retrieve his money. Harvey now controls all of Tinkler's Patinack horse breeding and racing assets, which will be auctioned at the Magic Millions in September. Patinack Farm in the Hunter Valley NSW - one of Australia's most renowned racehorse breeding locations - is worth an estimated $20 million. Gerry Harvey is now in control of Tinkler's racing assets and will sell them at the magic Millions in September . Patinack Farm in the Hunter Valley is one of the assets up for sale which could rake in $20 million . Also set to be sold at this year's Magic Millions are stallions Murtajill, Monaco Consul, Trusting and Lope De Vega, which have a combined value of around $6 million. Harvey revealed the reason he loaned so much money to the former mining magnate was because he thought Tinkler had a chance of working his way out of the mess he was in. He also told of the good Tinkler had done for the racehorse industry, particularly during the Global Financial Crisis. Spending millions upon millions on horses, a figure Harvey estimated to be upwards of $200 million, was unprecedented in the industry. For the sale of so many of his assets, Tinkler has apparently enlisted the help of racing expert Richard Freeman. If all goes to plan, Harvey will be reimbersed with his $45 million and the rest of the profits - which could be in total between $50 and $100 million - will go to Tinkler himself. Just last week it was revealed that Tinkler had become a father for the fifth time with his former executive assistant, 'pretty blonde' Jodie Van Gilst, Sydney Morning Herald report. Stallion Monaco Consul could be sold for over $1 million . Ms Van Gilst recently gave birth and is reportedly living at Tinkler's Singapore luxury suite in the Marina Collection development. Tinkler's former spokesman, who says the 38-year-old currently doesn't have a manager, told Daily Mail Australia the new baby was born about two weeks ago. The spokesman, who no longer represents Tinkler, was unable to provide further details. Tinkler's estranged wife, Rebecca, has resided in Hawaii with the couple's four children since last year, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. They are living in their $16 million mansion in the 'exclusively gated community' of Keauhou on the island of Maui. The Hawaii home was purchased in November 2011, just before the troubled billionaire was forced to announce fire sale of his various assets and undergo the repossession of his private jet and a Falcon 900. Earlier this month Tinkler became a father for the fifth time . Tinkler's estranged wife, Rebecca, resides in Hawaii with the couple's four children in their $16 million mansion on the island of Maui . According to Private Sydney, the Tinkler marriage was already on the rocks but it was 'the final straw' when Van Gilst's pregnancy became apparent to Rebecca. Ms Van Gilst, from Queensland, had enjoyed reoccurring trips to the exclusive Birdcage marquees at the Melbourne Cup. In 2012, Ms Van Gilst was spotted at the Melbourne Grand Prix with her now baby's father but Tinkler's spokesman shut down the reports, stating they were there 'purely on business.' Tinkler declared just $9800 in personal taxable income in 2010-11. He is currently under investigation with ICAC due to allegations in a corrupt scheme to pay illegal donations to Liberal Party candidates. These claims have been denied by Tinkler.

"By . Leesa Smith for Daily Mail Australia . King's School headmaster Dr Tim Hawkes . A prestigious boys high school in Sydney is at the centre of serious allegations of indecent assault made by a group of boarding students. Police are investigating the incident at The King's School in Parramatta where it has been alleged that unwanted sexual contact occurred including the act of 'turkey slapping', where a male student is said to have rubbed his genitals on another boy's face. Police confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that detectives from the Child Abuse Squad are investigating allegations of indecent and physical assault at a school in Sydney's north-west. 'The allegations relate to students assaulting other students,' the statement said. 'Given those alleged to be involved are juveniles it would be inappropriate for police to provide any further detail at this  time.' The private boarding school's headmaster, Dr Tim Hawkes, confirmed that police were investigating the allegations made by students. 'The school has been made aware of an allegation and is cooperating with the police over the matter,' Dr Hawkes told the Daily Telegraph. Police conducted a search of the school’s administration building two Fridays ago. Some of the alleged incidents, which began as practical jokes, were allegedly filmed and uploaded to social media websites, according to the Daily Telegraph.

"By . Mia De Graaf for MailOnline . An Afghan man found dead in a shipping container in Essex was trying to escape a loan shark demanding more than £240,000, reports claim. Meet Singh Kapoor, 40, died in front of his wife and two sons crammed on top of chemical barrels . The family is said to have fled Jalalabad 18 months ago  in a bid to escape the warlord who loaned Mr Kapoor $70,000 (£42,000) to set up a clothing firm. Scroll down for video . Fled: Meet Singh Kapoor died in this container after allegedly fleeing a £240,000 debt to a warlord loan shark . But two weeks ago, he was found dead alongside 35 other Afghan Sikhs – including 13 children – crammed inside the container, which had just arrived at Tilbury Docks from Belgium. Last night, his uncle Dilip Singh told The Times Mr Kapoor had no option but to turn to smugglers as he could not afford to pay the debt, which was rapidly increasing in value. Mr Singh said his nephew did not expect to be in a container, adding: 'Traffickers always say it will be easy and there will be no big problems. He must have trusted them.' Pictures, released by Essex Police, show the stowaways had barely enough room to move and nowhere to relieve themselves. They were eventually rescued at the port of Tilbury in Essex after staff heard screaming and banging coming from inside the large box on a P&O freight ferry from Belgium. The metal container which was clearly labelled ‘Hudig and Kersten’ - on board a ship from Zeebrugge - was opened up by staff at around 6.30am on Saturday morning. The distraught people inside – including 13 children - were treated at the scene and at a local hospital for severe dehydration and hypothermia. Father-of-two Mr Singh Kapoor was declared dead at the scene. Trapped: His uncle claims Mr Kapoor, his wife and two sons did not expect to be in a container to get to the UK . The group were among a tiny minority of Sikhs left in Afghanistan and are believed to have fled the country six months ago after suffering persecution. After being released, the Afghans said that they feared they were 20 minutes from death and were drifting ‘in and out of consciousness’. One of the immigrants, a man in 30s, told the Daily Mail that the survivors had been left frazzled by their ordeal and were struggling to piece together their harrowing journey. Kamaljit Singh Matharu, who has been acting as a translator for the group, said: ‘The immigrants have been through a lot, they are traumatised. ‘They are still very frightened and confused.’ The group had been trafficked into the UK via the Belgium port of Zeebrugge. Belgian police believe the immigrants were already inside when the container was delivered to the port before setting sail for Britain.","Meet Singh Kapoor, 40, was found dead in container from Belgium .

"By . Glenn Owen For The Mail On Sunday . 'No': Sir Paul McCartney (pictured with wife Nancy Shevell) has become one of the most high-profile celebrities to back the 'no' campaign . Sir Paul McCartney has become one of the most high-profile celebrities yet to back the campaign against Scottish independence by demanding: 'Let's stay together.' The former Beatle – who wrote Mull Of Kintyre in tribute to the remote part of Scotland where he owns a farm – has signed an open letter calling on voters to choose No in next month's referendum. His intervention, announced at a rally in his home city of Liverpool, came as David Cameron admitted that he was 'emotional and nervous' about the result of the ballot in just 18 days' time. The letter signed by Sir Paul, along with other public figures including Sir Mick Jagger, Professor Stephen Hawking and Sir Bobby Charlton, declares: 'We want to let you know how very much we value our bonds of citizenship with you, and to express our hope that you will vote to renew them.' It adds: 'What unites us is much greater than what divides us. Let's stay together.' TV historian Dan Snow, one of the campaign co-ordinators for Let's Stay Together, said at the event in Liverpool: 'Sir Paul is one of the world's most respected musicians. We are humbled that he has signed the letter. 'Sir Paul's signature, alongside Sir Mick Jagger's and those of tens of thousands of people from all over the country, shows that English, Welsh and Northern Irish people hope passionately that the Scottish vote to renew their bonds of citizenship with us.' The song Mull Of Kintyre, featuring the local Campbeltown pipe band, was the Christmas No 1 in 1977 and became the first single to sell two million copies in the UK. Sir Paul bought High Park Farm in 1966 when he was living with actress Jane Asher, before turning it into a family home with his fist wife Linda. He has said that he was inspired by the 'wandering single-track roads and sense of solace' of the 600-acre estate to write The Long And Winding Road. Anti-independence campaigner: TV presenter Dan Snow (pictured) gathers support in Liverpool at the announcement that Sir Paul McCartney is backing their cause . Yesterday Mr Cameron admitted to being worried about the referendum after a poll last week showed that No campaign's lead has been cut in half to just six points. The poll followed a second televised debate between First Minister Alex Salmond and Better Together campaign leader Alistair Darling in which Mr Salmond emerged on top. The Prime Minister said: 'I'm emotional and nervous because it matters so much.' But he insisted that there was a 'silent majority' of people who were afraid to admit to their support for the union 'because they worry about retribution from the Scottish government'. Poster boy: The Let's Stay Together blog proudly parades Paul McCartney on their site after he signed their open letter . Sir Paul's intervention led to predictable blizzard of song puns. Scottish Labour MP Anne McGuire, a No supporter, said: 'We are glad to have the Help! of Sir Paul McCartney. It is hardly surprising that Sir Paul wants us to Come Together. Maybe rather than trying to take us all on a Magical Mystery Tour, Alex Salmond should just Let it Be.' A spokesman for the pro-independence camp said: 'It's fantastic that Sir Paul loves Scotland, and we're sure he will continue to do so after Scots say, ''Yeah, yeah, yeah''. The case for Yes is a democratic one – as far as Scotland is concerned the Westminster system belongs to Yesterday, and independence will be good for the Mull Of Kintyre and all of Scotland. Yes is definitely the best Ticket To Ride.' Sir Paul's spokesman declined to comment. WITH just over a couple of weeks to go to an event where a small minority of a nation could well destroy my country without any participation from the majority (some exercise in democracy, that), I just want to address two things that still trouble me. Firstly, independence from what exactly? At the last General Election, the Scottish Conservative Party polled 17 per cent of the popular vote and the Scottish Nationalist Party polled 20 per cent – just three points more. Braveheart fiction: Former trade minister Digby Jones claims a small minority could destroy Scotland . So just as those in the Yes Campaign say they want to be free of rule by the hated Tories of Westminster, what about those Scottish Conservatives and many more non-Tories who cannot abide Alex Salmond's snake oil? Why should they be enslaved by an ideology that means not just that they will have a government they have to tolerate for the next five years, but that they will become unwilling citizens for ever in a new country they didn't even want to exist? Is it independence to share the pound but have no influence in the decisions concerning interest rates? Is it independence to be punished severely by the markets (with higher debt-service costs) for defaulting on Scotland's share of the deficit? Digby Jones suggests it's arrogant of Alex Salmond to expect the Queen will carry on acting as a monarch for Scotland as well . Secondly: how will the rest of the UK respond if the tartan turkeys do indeed vote for Christmas on September 18? I do hope we will not roll over and give an independent Scotland the fuzzy partnership of allowing them to cherry-pick all the best bits of the old UK (including Her Majesty the Queen – how arrogant of Mr Salmond just to assume she will still be their Queen. Has anyone asked her?). We must not take the Nationalistic punch on the chin, letting it be 'business as usual'. So yes, let's have proper border controls. Given they won't be in the EU from the start (Spain will see to that, given they won't want a rampant Catalonia on their hands), let's make everyone north of the border apply for a visa. Until Scotland becomes part of the EU, someone resident in Scotland seeking to come and live in England should be treated just the same as someone resident in India. No they can't just decide unilaterally to share our currency... they wanted this divorce, not us. Mr Salmond is like the husband seeking a divorce against the will of his wife but saying he's keeping all the best bits of the matrimonial home. We will not build our warships in a foreign country so the Govan and Rosyth shipyards will close, for starters. Just explain that to the good men and women who have built our warships there for centuries but will now be looking for the enhanced welfare payments promised by the nationalists. How will independence pay for those? Increased taxes? Public-spending cuts? And most of all, when the oil price is cyclically against them, when the financial services community has left town, when the independent Scots are faced with cutting public services and putting up taxes, when the Scottish at last awake from their Braveheart dream and will take no more, I do so hope that the new, Independent Nation of England, Wales & Northern Ireland will not use my and others' taxes to bail out the new Independent Nation of Scotland. No one gave us a say in this matter so it will not be our problem to solve. Independence is for ever; it isn't something you can change at the next Election if you don't like it. It isn't something you can call a day on. Every Braveheart voting with his or her heart will be stuck with it. It's about running a country, Mr Salmond, not taking part in a Mel Gibson fiction. lLord Jones is Business Ambassador at UK Trade & Investment.","Former Beatle puts his signature to 'Let's Stay Together' open letter .

"By . Leesa Smith for Daily Mail Australia . and Freya Noble for Daily Mail Australia . The man suspected of shooting dead two Work and Income staff members in Ashburton on Monday morning has been caught by New Zealand police. Russel John Tully, also known as John Henry Tully, was found by police not far from Lake Hood, which is the search area officers had been searching for most of the day. Tully is believed to have entered the  Work and Income office in Ashburton, about 90 kilometres south of Christchurch on New Zealand's South Island, and opened fire before fleeing the scene on his pushbike. Canterbury district police commander Superintendent Gary Knowles said police dogs tracked Tully for some distance and that there was no stand-off and no shots were fired. Supt Knowles said he was suffering from minor dog bites and was taken to the Ashburton police station. He will be medically examined before he is formally interviewed. No charges have yet been laid. Police found Russel John Tully, also known as John Henry Tully (pictured), after a shooting in Ashburton, New Zealand on Monday . Officers surveyed the area hunting for Tully who allegedly fled the scene on his pushbike on Monday morning . One witness at the scene stopped his van in the middle of the road when he spotted a man wearing a black balaclava run into the centre wielding a gun. He told the NZ Herald a staff member chased the gunman from the building after the shooting screaming: 'You bastard, you've blown her to bits!'. The witness added he couldn't bring himself to go inside the office though: 'I didn't want to see that.' Another witness who was inside during the gruesome shooting said he believed both the victims to be staff members at the Ashburton centre, and said he thinks the man broke down what he described as a shotgun and put it in his backpack upon leaving. 'It was incredibly loud, I could feel the air whoosh past my head,' the witness said speaking of the shots. Ashburton is located about 90 kilometres south of Christchurch, on the South Island of New Zealand . The shooting left two dead and another person in a serious but stable condition . At the press conference before finding Tully, Mr Knowles warned residents if there was no need for them to leave the house they should stay put. He said it was not a case of lock-down but people needed to be vigilant. 'I think people need to be prudent - if they see anything suspicious, anyone in their back yards, anyone hiding in a shed, please contact us urgently, we want to find this guy', he said at the time. Mr Knowles added that residents who lived by the Ashburton River should take extra precaution, following reports that the gunman may have fled in that direction. The Ministry of Social Development Chief Executive Brendan Boyle told NZ Herald all their offices in Ashburton, Timaru and Christchurch had been shut down in light of the tragedy. Additionally, schools and early childcare centres in the area had been contacted by authorities and students were being kept inside until more news came to light.

They spent months at a time in each location, making friends and immersing themselves in the culture. The last part of their trip saw them travel back to Scotland where they met up with family in Perth.The epic journey cost just shy of £15,000 - excluding the cost of the campervan. Their . daily costs rose slightly during their trips to Australia, Thailand and . the Middle East as they had to leave their mobile home behind. However, they brought the overall budget back in line by reducing how much they spent while living in Morocco. Katie, 10, pictured with a camel in the Sahara (l) and father Neil on top of mountain in Austria (r) 'Our . budget was £8 per person per day for food, accommodation costs, travel . and everything else,' said Jen. 'Although the campervan helped keep this . down.' Taking the kids out of school could have had a huge . impact on their education if it weren't for the fact that Neil and Jen . made sure they wouldn't fall behind during their year out. In order . to do this they bought books which covered the curriculum their children . would have covered during the same year at school. Head teachers should only authorise leave of absence in exceptional circumstances. If a head teacher grants a leave request, it will be for the head teacher to determine the length of time that the child can be away from school. Leave is unlikely, however, to be granted for the purposes of a family holiday as a norm.

They also had to write to education chiefs in France to get permission to take them out of school for 12 months. Once they got the go ahead, the only challenge left was getting them to do the work on the move. Jen . said she and Neil had the 'fanciful' idea of getting their kids out of . bed at 7am every morning and working from 8 to 10am but that notion . didn't last long. She said: 'That lasted a week. In all honesty, even . a little less than that. It might have worked for some families but it . was a disaster for ours. 'We forgot the plain old fact that teenagers have a changing body-clock and mornings are, basically, tough. 'We nagged for a while, being new to it all, but by the time we hit Spain, our first country, we began to relax.' Jen said the boys were given the task of breaking up what they had to learn and working out when they'd cover each section. Amazingly, they stuck to their plan and kept up their schoolwork throughout the trip. Jen . said: 'The less we pushed the more they did. The nagging lingered for a . couple of months but we could see that, as it died away, the motivation . rate increased.'

"By . Daniel Martin for the Daily Mail . David Cameron’s hopes of reforming Britain’s relationship with Brussels received a boost as the new president of the European Council came out in support of a clampdown on benefit tourism. Donald Tusk said he ‘could not imagine’ the EU without Britain – and it would be a ‘dark scenario’ if we left. He described the EU’s free movement of labour rules as a ‘barrier’ to continued UK membership, insisting it would be possible to ‘reach an agreement’ on change. Scroll down for video . Lifeline? Donald Tusk (left) could be David Cameron's answer to renegotiating powers with Brussels . ‘We can work together to eliminate any welfare abuse by EU migrants,’ he said. Mr Cameron has pledged a referendum on whether Britain should stay in Europe, held in 2017, after renegotiations with Brussels. Reform of immigration laws to crack down on free movement is a key goal for the Tories, particularly the right of migrants to claim benefits here. The comments by Mr Tusk, the Polish prime minister, will give Downing Street greater optimism that they will achieve success. Mr Cameron hopes Mr Tusk will be able to act as a counterweight to the other powerful EU figure, president of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker, who is likely to seek to block reforms. A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘We think it is important that we have got a partner in the presidency of the EU Council who we can work with on reform.’ This is the number of immigrants hitting the UK . Poland has already been working with the UK on deregulation to help business, expansion of the single market and the exploitation of cheaper energy such as shale gas. Ex-Tory MP Douglas Carswell, who has defected to Ukip, said he had no confidence in the Prime Minister’s ability to persuade Brussels to agree significant reform. But it is understood the Polish leader is ready to support a crackdown on ‘benefit tourism’, such as supporting limits on welfare payments to migrant workers. Mr Tusk said he wanted to ‘emphasise that the EU, and me personally, will take on the concerns voiced by the UK’. ‘I am talking about the UK because I am sure that the future of the EU is not about making it smaller, about contraction,’ he said. ‘No reasonable person can imagine the EU without the UK. I cannot imagine it myself. 'I have talked about it with David Cameron. 'He put forward many proposals for reforms and I am sure with a reasonable framework of politicians we can reach an agreement. ‘We can strive to eliminate various barriers – freedom of movement of workers, for example.’ Mr Tusk added: ‘We’ll need solutions to the concerns of Great Britain. 'No one reasonable can envisage the dark scenario of an EU without Britain. 'Many of the suggestions put forward for EU reform [by Mr Cameron] are sensible. We can work together to eliminate any welfare abuse by EU migrants.’ Mr Cameron welcomed the comments, saying: ‘I’m delighted obviously with what Donald Tusk has said about the importance of reform in the EU and addressing the concern that Britain has in the EU. 'I look forward to working with him in the months and the years ahead.’ The Prime Minister’s support for Mr Tusk’s presidency is a significant departure from earlier this year when the two fell out after Mr Cameron singled out the £55million paid in child benefits to Polish immigrants. Also appointed was new foreign policy chief, Italy’s Federica Mogherini, who will take over from Britain’s Cathy Ashton. Blocking plans: Jean-Claude Junker is expected to block Cameron's pitch for a renegotiation of power . Business executives claim Britain could still flourish as a trading superpower even in the event of an exit . The Prime Minister’s success in backing the right horse in Mr Tusk is in sharp contrast to his humiliating failure to block Mr Juncker as Commission president earlier this year. Mr Juncker is an arch federalist who is unlikely to be willing to support limits on the free movement of workers. Outgoing Council president Herman Van Rompuy said ‘Britain’s place in the Union’ was one of three challenges facing Mr Tusk, along with the ‘stagnating economy’ and Russia’s dispute with Ukraine. Ukip MEP Bill Etheridge said: ‘Donald Tusk is a rabid EU centraliser who wants to take more power away from national governments and hand it over to Brussels … It is a scandal that David Cameron would back Poland’s Donald Tusk for … president of the European Council.’","Polish prime minister Donald Tusk has renewed optimism in No10 .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . and Josh Gardner for MailOnline . A central Pennsylvania man will serve 28 to 56 years behind bars for suffocating his girlfriend after she survived his deliberate, high-speed crash. Lancaster Online reports Benjamin Klinger pleaded guilty to third-degree murder and was sentenced Friday. Authorities say Klinger was physically and verbally abusive to 17-year-old Samantha Heller during their turbulent relationship. Horrific: Benjamin Klinger (left) has pleaded guilty to intentionally smashing his car into a guardrail and then smothering to death his girlfriend, 17-year-old Samantha Heller (right) In December 2012, prosecutors say Klinger intentionally sped into a guardrail at over 100 mph. Police say he sat on Heller after she lived through the wreck near Manheim. A truck driver who came upon the 2am crash heard Heller hanging outside the window and screaming, 'Get off of me!' but was told by 911 operators not to move the crash victims. When police arrived, Klinger was sitting on top of Heller's head and torso, according to the arrest affidavit. 'Klinger was observed by the officers to be what appeared as 'slipping in and out of consciousness,' because he would close his eyes for several seconds, moan, and then reopen his eyes while continuing to be positioned on top of the victim's head and torso while the victim was face down,' police wrote. Based on medical records, investigators later concluded Klinger was pretending to be unconscious. Abusive: Klinger reportedly had a rocky and abusive relationship with Heller leading up to the horrific crime, for which he'll serve up to 56 years in prison . Shocking scene: An eyewitness said he heard Heller screaming for help as Klinger sat on top of her, but a 911 operator told the witness not to move the victims . An autopsy perform of Heller's body has revealed that the teen died from multiple injuries and asphyxiation. Dr. Wayne Ross, who performed the autopsy, concluded 'the cause of death is consistent with someone sitting on (Heller).' Detectives recovered marijuana, cash, a digital scale, a pipe, pills and a black air pistol from the wreckage. The 21-year-old Klinger apologized in court and said he takes 'full responsibility for the loss of a very special person.' He wept as he apologized, which Judge Margaret Miller said was the the first she'd seen 'any degree of humanity or emotion' in Klinger. The victim's mother, Sandy McFalls, says her heart has been shattered. 'I want you to have nothing else to do (in prison) but think about how you took her life and destroyed ours,' McFalls said in a statement to the court, reported LancasterOnline. Klinger's sentence includes time for a drug charge and for sending sexually explicit photos of a minor.","Benjamin Klinger will serve 28 to 56 years in prison for third degree murder as well as a drug charge and for sending explicit photos to a minor .

"By . Leon Watson . The family of a lost Second World War pilot whose plane was discovered in the desert 70 years after crashing feel 'let down' when they were told human remains found close by weren't his. Relatives of Dennis Copping have been holding out hope that bones located three miles from the perfectly-preserved RAF plane in the Sahara are those of the airman. But after months of waiting and receiving mixed messages from the Ministry of Defence, they have now been told that it is not possible to extract DNA from the remains. The news has been met with frustration by Flight Sergeant Copping's nephew, John Pryor-Bennett, who had been about to fly to Egypt to provide a comparative DNA sample. Scroll down to see the wreckage discovery scene: . Mysterious disappearance: Flight Sergeant Dennis Copping . crashed in the desert in 1942, and his plane was only uncovered last year . Mounting evidence: The twelve bones were found three miles found the plane, along with a piece of parachute, keyfob and metal button with 1939 on it . Bid for survival: The P40 Kittyhawk was found perfectly preserved and someone had apparently tried to build a shelter beside it . But the apparent inability to take DNA . from the bones has been met with doubt by four forensic pathologists . who have become involved in the case. They now plan to travel to Cairo and . examine the bones for themselves to give Mr Pryor-Bennett and his family . a definitive answer. After the bones were found last year, . the family was initially told by the MoD that they were far too old to . have been those of the lost airman. It then emerged that this ruling was . based on a flippant remark made by a member of the Egyptian authorities . and the remains hadn't been examined at all. Mr Pryor-Bennett, 62, was then invited to supply a DNA sample only for the bones to now be written off. He and the forensic pathologists are . demanding to know how authentic the tests have been up until now and . more details about the circumstances of the examinations. Mr Pryor-Bennett, from Kinsale, Cork, . Ireland, said: 'I am a little bit appalled about how all of this has . been handled. All the information that I have received since these bones . were discovered last June has been misleading and vague. 'At first I was told the bones were . 400- years-old but information was on the back of a conversation about . how more often than not bones in the desert were that age. 'Then it was arranged that I would fly . to Cairo and give a DNA sample to the Egyptians so they could compare . it with DNA from the bones. 'Now I have received a call from the . MoD to say that the Egyptian authorities have done the tests and the . bones aren't good enough to get a DNA profile from. 'I'm no expert but is it not possible . to get DNA from a dinosaur bone? The people who found King Richard III . were able to get a DNA sample from his bones and they were over 600 . years old. Poignant: Flight Sergeant Denis Copping in his RAF uniform aged 24, just days before he went missing . Ready for combat: Flt Sgt Copping proudly looks down from the cockpit of his Kittyhawk P-40 . 'I am very disappointed with all of . this and can't help feel let down. Dennis Copping was a serving his . country and was out there doing his bit. If these remains are his he . should be treated properly and given a proper burial.' Ft Sgt Copping, 24, of the 260 . Squadron, had been flying a P40 Kittyhawk plane between two British . bases in Egypt during the north Africa campaign when he disappeared. Family memories: William Pryor-Bennett is the nephew of Flt Sgt Copping . Nothing was ever seen of him or his . plane again until 12 months ago when a team of Polish oil exploration . workers stumbled upon the perfectly-preserved aircraft. There was evidence to suggest Ft Sgt . Copping survived the crash as a makeshift shelter had been made using . his parachute outside of the plane. It is thought he died while making a futile attempt to walk out of the desert. A month later a team of historians . from Italy unearthed 12 human bones close to an outcrop of rocks about . three miles from the plane. A piece of torn parachute was found . close to the remains along with a keychain fob with the number 61 on it. A metal button dated 1939 was also recovered nearby. Dr Laurence Garey, an independent . forensic anatomist who has worked at the University of Oxford and the . University of Lausanne in Switzerland, is doubtful of the latest . development. He said: 'It is quite inconceivable and I cannot accept that is true. 'I have got DNA samples from bones far . older than 70 years before. DNA has been extracted from 60 . million-year-old dinosaurs in the Oman desert before. I am one of four . forensic pathologists hoping to go out there to find out the truth.' A spokesman for the MoD said: 'The . Egyptian medical research authorities have tested some bones and have . come back and said it is not possible for a DNA sample to be extracted . from them. 'We have informed Copping family accordingly.' The last known whereabouts of the P40 Kittyhawk plane was in a storage crater in El Alemain. The Royal Air Force Museum at Hendon . has been in negotiations with the relevant Egyptian authorities to have . the aircraft returned to Britain but it is not known how far that has . progressed. Sky sentinel: A Kittyhawk in U.S.Airforce colours in flight at Duxford Airfield in Cambridgeshire . Time capsule: Aside from the damage it sustained during impact, the aircraft appears to have been almost perfectly preserved in the sands of the Sahara . Chance discovery: The single-seater aircraft was found by a Polish oil company worker exploring a remote region of the western desert in Egypt . Intact: Most of the plane's cockpit instruments were untouched and it still had it guns and ammunition before they were seized by the Egyptian military for safety reasons . Second World War weaponry: The machine gun on the wing of the crashed plane. It appears the pilot got into trouble and brought it down in the middle of the desert . Bullet holes: The Kittyhawk appears to have been . shot at (left), while its broken propeller lays nearby (right). Historians have described the find as the 'aviation equivalent of . Tutankhamun's Tomb' Well-preserved: The Kittyhawk's magazine of bullets were also found in the wreckage. The radio and batteries were discovered out of the plane . At the controls: The plane's cockpit, but there are fears over what will be left of it after locals began stripping parts and instruments for souvenirs and scrap . Unseen and untouched: Equipment and controls . from the plane were found scattered around the craft at the crash site. The plane is still in very good condition . Heading home: The RAF Museum at Hendon, north London, has been made aware of the discovery and plans are underway to recover the aircraft for exhibition in the future . Sign of the time: The Kittyhawk's factory stamp . (left) and gun loading instruction panel (right). However, some locals . see the aircraft as a piece of junk . Signs of survival: Flight Sergeant Dennis Copping's parachute was part of what is believed to be a makeshift camp alongside the fuselage . Remote: The crash site is about 200 miles from the nearest town. No human remains have been found but it is thought the pilot's decomposed body may lay anywhere in a 20 mile radius of the plane .

"By . James Rush . Fears have been raised that the schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram militants earlier this year are being used as suicide bombers. The speculation has arisen after a number of female suicide bombings in Nigeria's biggest city of Kano, while a ten-year-old girl wearing explosives was also discovered in Katsina state. The latest attack came on Wednesday when a female suicide bomber blew herself up at a college in Kano, killing six people. According to reports, the bomber was a female teenager. Scroll down for video . Police officers stand guard at the scene of a female suicide bomb attack outside a school in Kano, Nigeria, on Wednesday . It was the fourth suicide bombing carried out by a female in the city in the past week. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, although militant group Boko Haram, which is fighting for an Islamic state in religiously-mixed Nigeria, has repeatedly bombed Kano as it radiates attacks outwards from its northeast heartlands. Government spokesman Mike Omeria said security forces arrested three Boko Haram suspects in Katsina state, two of them female, on Tuesday. One was a 10-year-old girl who had an explosive belt strapped to her by the others, he said. Using female suicide bombers in the city appears to be a new tactic of Boko Haram, although they have used them on occasion for years in the northeast. Two female suicide bombers blew themselves up at a trade show and a petrol station in Kano on Monday, killing one other person and injuring at least six others. Rescue workers collect clothes at the scene of the female suicide bomb attack outside the school in Kano, Nigeria, on Wednesday . On Sunday, a female suicide bomber killed herself but no one else while trying to target police officers. Concerns have now been raised the militant group is using the schoolgirls kidnapped earlier this year in Chibok in the suicide bombings. Former education minister Oby Ezekwesili has warned the kidnapped girls may be 'indoctrinated or coerced into being used as suicide bombers', according to the International Business Times. On Sunday Ms Ezekwesili tweeted: 'This new trend&serial pattern of ""FEMALE SUICIDE BOMBERS"" surely should PARTICULARLY worry us. It worries me stiff cos of our #ChibokGirls.' The following day she wrote: 'Kano again and again. Female suicide bombers again and again - becoming trend. Our #ChibokGirls still in the enemy den. Are we THINKING?' Meanwhile, the Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria has urged the government to investigate the identity of the suicide bombers, the International Business Times reported. In a statement, it said: 'In the event that these female suicide bombers are identified to have been the same kidnapped girls then the government should immediately deploy all resources and strategies to bring to an end, once and for all, this shameful scenario since the military have repeatedly stated that they are aware of the whereabouts of the kidnapped Chibok girls.' In a separate incident on Tuesday, two suicide bombers killed 13 people in attacks on two mosques in the town of Potiskum, in Yobe state in the northeast, medical official Bala Afuwa, who received the bodies at a local hospital, told Reuters by telephone on Wednesday. About 250 schoolgirls were kidnapped in April by members of the militant group Boko Haram . 'Two of my uncles were killed,' said resident Mohammed Abubakar, whose family home is next to one of the mosques that were attacked. 'They had just returned from the mosque.' President Goodluck Jonathan, who has come under heavy criticism for failing to end the five-year-old rebellion, pledged $500 million on Wednesday towards Nigerians living in states that are worst affected by Boko Haram violence. Earlier this month kidnapped Nigerian schoolgirls who managed to escape from their Islamic extremist captors were reunited with the president. He heard tales from some of the 57 who escaped after their abduction on April 15 before assuring them of his determination that those still in captivity ‘are brought out alive’. Around 57 students managed to flee shortly after they were captured, but a committee investigating their disappearance said 219 of the girls are still missing. Earlier this month kidnapped Nigerian schoolgirls who managed to escape from their Islamic extremist captors met with President Goodluck Jonathan . According to a mediator working with Boko Haram two of the girls have died of snake bites while around 20 have fallen ill. Boko Haram is demanding a swap for detained fighters in exchange for the girls. Most of the schoolgirls are still believed to be held in the Sambisa Forest - a wildlife reserve that includes a mixture of thick jungle and open savannah. The forest borders on sand dunes marking the edge of the Sahara Desert. Sightings of the girls and their captors have been reported in neighboring Cameroon and Chad. Chibok and nearby villages are targets because they are enclaves of staunch Christians in predominantly Muslim north Nigeria.","Speculation arises after series of female suicide bombings in city of Kano .

The clip also finishes with a shot of an iconic image of a horrific 2008 bike crash in Mexico, in which a drunk driver plowed into a group of people in a race, killing one and injuring at least 10 others. The caption read: 'Like you've never thought about it ...' The video found its way to the station's Facebook page and did not bode well with Weintraub's bosses, NBC San Diego reported. On Saturday, a post from the Department said Weintraub had been placed on administrative leave.

"By . Chris Hastings, Arts Correspondent . Eye shield: Mrs Thatcher in dark lenses . Margaret Thatcher insisted on wearing dark glasses on her first trip to Africa because she feared black activists would throw acid in her face. The Prime Minister believed her ‘instinctively pro-white’ stance had made her a hate figure across the continent and she insisted on donning the glasses as her plane prepared to land at the dead of night in the Zambian capital of Lusaka in August in 1979. Lord Carrington the then Foreign Secretary reveals Mrs Thatcher’s fears for her personal safety in today’s (Sunday) edition of BBC Radio 4’s Reunion programme which reunites figures who played a role in the ending of white rule in the former British colony of Rhodesia and the establishment of an independent Zimbabwe in 1980. Lord Carrington who was aboard the same flight said: 'What was rather interesting. I don’t think Margaret Thatcher had ever been to Africa before in her life. I don’t think so.' He added: 'I remember as we approached Lusaka in the pitch dark she suddenly put on her dark glasses and I said to her ‘What on earth are you doing putting your dark glasses are? And she said: ‘Well I am so hated here. I am sure they are going to throw acid in my face.' Lord Carrington recalls trying to calm Mrs Thatcher’s nerves and how she was eventually ‘overcome’ by the warmth of the welcome she received. He said: 'I said to her no I don’t think you understand the Africans. I don’t think they will do that at all. 'I think they will probably cheer when you get in. When we arrived and touched down and there was a see of black faces all smiling she took her dark glasses off and she walked down the gangway of the airport as if they was no problem at all. She was so overcome with the welcome.' The early months of Mrs Thatcher’s premiership were dominated by the bloody struggle for independence in the former British colony of Southern Rhodesia. Lord Carrington recalls how he and officials in the Foreign Office tried to dissuaded Mrs Thatcher from instinctively supporting the white regime of Ian Smith who had previously declared unilateral independence for Rhodesia in 1965. He said: 'My colleagues in the Foreign Office and I did our very best. The thing about Margaret Thatcher was that she was instinctively in favour of the whites and Ian Smith and instinctively against the Africans. 'But if you got in before the instincts had taken over the brain was very good and you had a chance of changing her mind.' Mrs Thatcher’s visit to the Zambia was a public relations triumph and did much to heal the rift between her and other African leaders. The visit would lead to the establishment of all party talks at Lancaster House in London which would lead to the establishment of Zimbabwe. Lord Carrington, pictured here with the former Prime Minister, said Mrs Thatcher was eventually 'overcome' by the warmth of the welcome shown to her in Zambia . During the course of today’s programme Lord Carrington refuses to comment on claims that the British security services bugged the hotel rooms of African delegates who were taking part in the talks. Lord Carrington also recalls his first meeting with Robert Mugabe who would become Prime Minister in 1980 and who continues to control the country today. He said: 'A Jesuit Marxist is a very unusual person. I found him a difficult man. Rather slippery.' Lord Carrington said that Mugabe did not feel any bitterness towards Ian Smith despite being held prisoner for more than eleven years. He told the Foreign Secretary: 'I don’t feel bitter about people. I feel bitter about the system.' Lord Carrington said the fact that Robert Mugabe had now become a brutal dictator should not detract from the success of the Lancaster House Agreement. He said: 'The result is one man one vote isn’t it. Every party in Britain was agreed that there should be black majority rule and thats what has happened. 'It wasn’t a perfect agreement but it was an agreement which I think would have enabled Zimbabwe to become a very powerful country indeed had things had not gone wrong afterwards.' The Reunion programme is on BBC Radio 4 today (Sunday) at 11.15 am.","Mrs Thatcher donned dark lenses as she landed in dead of night in Lusaka .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Barcelona's world famous Sagrada Família will finally be finished by 2026, the architect in charge has vowed... nearly 150 years after work began. That will make it ready in time for the centenary of the death of architect Antoni Gaudí, who famously joked that his client, God, was in no hurry to see it finished. Since then 65 per cent of the work has been completed and now, with new masonry techniques speeding up the work, builders say the Almighty will only have to wait another 13 years to see its final spires and main façade. Gaudi's masterwork: This artist's impression shows how Barcelona's La Sagrada Familia will look when it's finished in 2026 - 144 years after work on it began and 100 years after the architect who designed it was killed . 'If we continue at the pace we are now we will make it,' said Jordi Fauli, the architect currently in charge of the project, as the foundation funding the building released a video imagining how the finished building will look. Combining helicopter footage with computer animation, the YouTube clip shows La Sagrada Família's final stages take shape before your eyes. Its grand spires shoot up in succession, with its central cupola rising into view. The Glory facade, which Gaudi envisioned as the church's main entrance, appears to materialise from nothing. While often referred to as a cathedral, and originally intended as such, La Sagrada Família was consecrated in November 2010 as a basilica by Pope Benedict XVI. Cathedrals are the official seats of archbishops, but a basilica is a large and important church that has been given special ceremonial rights by the Pope.

La Sagrada Família attracts around 3million visitors a year, whose entrance fees pay for most of the €25million a year cost of continuing its construction, with gifts from private donors making up the rest. Construction began in 1882, with Gaudí's involvement commencing the following year when he took over the project and radically transformed it's design with his distinctive Gothic and curvilinear Art Nouveau style. Problems have long dogged work on Barcelona's second cathedral, with Gaudí neck-deep in the project when he was killed in 1926 when he was run over by a tram. The architect's body was not identified for several days after the impoverished 74-year-old was mistaken for a tramp. He lived long enough only to see a quarter of his masterwork completed.

He once said: 'There is no reason to regret that I cannot finish the church. I will grow old but others will come after me. 'What must always be conserved is the spirit of the work, but its life has to depend on the generations it is handed down to and with whom it lives and is incarnated.'","The first stone was laid at La Sagrada Familia in Barcelona in 1882 .

"By . Jennifer Newton for MailOnline . Paul Gascoigne has told of his latest alcohol relapse saying he knew if he went to hospital he would stop his latest drinking binge. The former England and Tottenham Hotspur footballer was released from hospital earlier this week after he was seen wandering the streets clutching a bottle of gin and cans of beer after seven months of sobriety. The pictures showed the ex-midfielder, who also played for Lazio, Everton and Rangers, slumped with his head in hands, outside his penthouse apartment in the exclusive Sandbanks area in Dorset. Scroll down for video . Paul Gascoigne, who has spoke of his latest alcohol torment, is pictured at his flat in Sandbanks, Dorset after being released from hospital earlier this week . Mr Gascoigne being led into an ambulance last week after his latest alcohol relapse, which led him to spend four days in hospital . Later looking frail and dishevelled, he was helped into an ambulance by a police officer. It had been said he had been on a three-week binge at his rented apartment in the latest chapter of his long battle with alcoholism. However, he now claims he had only been drinking for a few hours and started because he had been served with an eviction notice from his flat. He was taken from the flat by medics and driven to Poole Hospital, where he underwent a four-day detox. Now the 47-year-old has spoke of the moment of when he saw the ambulance to take him to hospital, saying he knew he instantly had to get inside. In an interview with the Sunday Mirror he said: 'In the past I have had binges that have lasted days, weeks, months. This time I had only been drinking for a few hours but I knew if I went to hospital I would be OK and that I would come through the other side. And I did.' When asked by the newspaper what drove him back to drinking, he explained: 'Being told I had to go left me really low. Last week the former footballer  was seen wandering the streets clutching a bottle of gin and cans of beer after seven months of sobriety . 'I started off by just buying a couple of cans of lager. Then that quickly became four cans, and I was off to buy a bottle of gin.' The ex-midfielder, who became a firm favourite with England fans also added that people had been leaving alcohol on his doorstep after finding out he had moved into the flat. It is said that Mr Gascoigne rang the police when people started continually ringing his doorbell and due to them being concerned by his voice, they attended his flat where they found him drunk and distressed and called an ambulance. He is now back at the flat after being released from hospital but only has two weeks left on his lease. On Monday he was pictured leaving the Poole Hospital and seemed in better shape when he appeared in a short-sleeved shirt. He added: 'I know I can overcome this. I am an alcoholic so I am taking one day at a time, but I will get there.' Mr Gascoigne, pictured playing against Belgium at the 1990 World Cup, became a firm favourite with England fans . During his long battle with alcohol, Mr Gascoigne has been to rehab several times and underwent treatment last April at the Cottonwood clinic in Arizona paid for footballing friends such as Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and DJ Chris Evans. It had been claimed that Mr Gascoigne was set to make his return to football after a journey for cigarettes led him to meet taxi driver and Abbey FC manager Chris Foster - who convinced the former England international to sign for the Hayward Sunday League side. Mr Gascoigne, who has been plagued by alcoholism and drug addiction, last played professional football ten years ago when he made five appearances for then-League Two side Boston United. Since his latest relapse, Queens Park Rangers manager Harry Redknapp, who also lives in Sandbanks, had offered the ex-footballer a way back into the game by coaching youngsters at the west London club. He said: 'I saw him about a month ago and I said ""I will pick you up in the mornings Gazza, come training with me. Do a little bit of work with the kids."" QPR boss Harry Redknapp, who says he had offered Mr Gascoigne a coaching job at the club . 'I would love it if he would do that, if he wants to do it I would pick him up every morning at 5:45am at the end of his road and bring him in.' But Mr Gascoigne has said he doesn't think he could take up the offer, which he says he was grateful for, due to Glenn Hoddle's involvement at the club. Mr Hoddle was the then England manager in 1998 who famously dropped the midfielder from that year's World Cup squad. High-profile incidents involving alcohol and Mr Gascoigne include being sacked as manager of Kettering in 2005 after he was accused of being drunk at games. He also appeared at the scene of the stand-off between the police and gunman Raoul Moat in 2010. Arriving in Rothbury, Northumberland, he claimed he was a friend of Moat and said he had brought him ''a can of lager, some chicken, fishing rod, a Newcastle shirt and a dressing gown''. But he is still remembered by fans of the clubs he played for - including Newcastle United, Lazio, Rangers, Everton and Middlesbrough - for his brilliance on the pitch.","Paul Gascoigne says he started drinking after seven months of sobriety .

"By . Rob Cooper . and Amie Keeley . Created: . 02:21 EST, 16 October 2013 . Every household in Britain will be required to separate their recycling from general waste from 2015 under new European Union rules. Councils across England and Wales have been told they have to follow EU guidance that will require paper, metal, glass and plastic to be collected separately from other rubbish. While the new directive does not specifically require this, and it will be the responsibility of each local authority to put in place the most effective policy for their local area, campaigners fear that homeowners will be forced to have yet more bins outside their properties. Rubbish collection system: Sylvia and Nick Butler with the nine . different categories of rubbish they are forced to sort through in . Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire. Such recycling division is not part of the EU guidance. Lord de Mauley, a minister in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), has written to all local authorities to warn them about the new EU directive. Under the Waste Framework Directive, councils must collect different types of waste separately. The . new rules are being brought in to help councils meet the European Union . target of recycling 50 per cent of all household waste by 2020. Bin blight: Councils across the country must collect paper, metal, plastic and glass separately from 2015 but the responsibility will lie with the local authority, not the homeowner . Some councils across the country have as many as nine different bins to sort their rubbish into, according to a study by the Taxpayers' Alliance in 2011. Homeowners in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, have to split their rubbish into nine different receptacles. Their rubbish gets divided between bins for:- refuse, food (kitchen), food (kerbside), cardboard, plastics paper, glass & cans, textiles and garden waste. The study found 21 councils across the country collect rubbish from seven or more bins, 58 collect from six or more bins and 136 collect from five or more bins. In his letter, Lord de Mauley wrote to councils: 'Where waste paper, metal, plastic or glass has been collected separately all reasonable steps must be taken to keep that stream separate from other waste streams wherever this is necessary to provide high-quality recyclates. ‘I look to local authorities actively to address these problems, by the effective implementation of the new regulations and by tackling problems with operating practices.’ Campaigners have claimed that the new rules will force homeowners to have yet more bins outside their properties. However, Lord Demauley insisted households would not necessarily need more bins and could follow other councils which already operate a ‘kerbside sort system’ where materials are sorted before being loaded into the waste collection vehicle. He added: ‘I am aware that this is a challenging time for local government as budgets reduce and expectations increase. I would urge all local authorities to work more closely with each other to sharpen procurement practices and share both facilities and services where possible.’ Doretta Cocks, spokeswoman for the Campaign for Weekly Waste Collection, said that more bins would create problems. 'Contamination . has been a long-standing problem since fortnightly residual waste . collections were introduced,' she told the Daily Telegraph. 'There is a need for higher quality recyclate but the system must be easy to use for residents. 'Multiple plastic crates for individual sorting of materials will create a storage problem for many residents.' Waste: Councils are expected to recycle 50 per cent of all rubbish by 2020 under EU targets . Under the European Union Waste Framework Directive, councils will have to collect paper, metal, plastic and glass separately from 2015. The new rules are being brought in as part of a drive to cut the amount of waste being thrown into landfill to 50 per cent by 2020. Separately, 70 per cent of waste from construction and demolition projects must be recycled by 2020. Local Government MP Brandon Lewis said: 'This Government is standing up for hard-working families, by working to increase the quality and frequency of recycling and rubbish collections. 'Recent BBC/ICM polling shows that residents' satisfaction with both has risen, at the same time that council tax has been kept down. 'Councils need to adopt a common sense approach, to make it easier for families to go green and reduce the amount thrown away in landfill dumps. 'There is no Whitehall directive saying that families must be overloaded with multiple bins. Indeed, this Government has recently issued new guidance to help tackle bin blight, due to homes not having proper bin storage.' A spokesman for Defra said that local authorities would not necessarily be forced to bring in new recycling bins if rubbish is sorted at the kerbside. 'From 2015 it will be a legal requirement to collect paper, metal, plastic and glass waste materials separately,' he said. 'This does not mean that mixed waste bin collections cannot continue; it is up to local authorities to decide what works best in their local area within the law.'","Paper, metal, glass and plastic will all have to be collected separately from other waste .
Changes brought in to meet EU target of recycling 50% of waste by 2020 .
Some councils already ask homeowners to separate out their rubbish into NINE different bins .
Campaigners fear directive will lead to an increase of bins outside homes .
An earlier version of this article said that under the EU Waste Framework Directive, every household in Britain would be expected to separate their recycling into four separate boxes. In fact, while the Directive does enforce the separate collection of recyclables, local authorities can comply without requiring households to use separate bins for four types of recycling. We are happy to clarify this."
"By . Chris Brooke for the Daily Mail . This is the shocking moment fireworks stored in a shed exploded at a wedding reception in Cumbria, killing two people. Guests at the reception on the shores of Lake Windermere fled in terror when they heard the explosion and saw smoke and fireworks, shortly after the bride and groom had posed for photographs on Saturday afternoon. Around 70 guests were mingling in the marquee of the countryside wedding venue when there was an ‘enormous explosion’ as fireworks went off in a nearby outbuilding, sparking a huge fire, witnesses said. Moment of terror: This picture shows the moment fireworks exploded at a wedding reception, killing two . Fire rampaged through outbuildings at the wedding reception in Windermere, Cumbria, on Saturday afternoon . The area was evacuated and the celebration had to be cancelled as firemen rushed to the reception, being held at a beauty spot yards from Windermere in Cumbria. Emergency services later recovered the bodies of a man and a woman. Their identities have not been released. None of the wedding party guests are thought to be missing, but police refused to confirm whether or not the victims had been working at the event. Insurance firm boss John Simpson, 61, married Nicole Rothwell, 44, and were holding the reception in the grounds of their lakeside home when the first started at 3.35pm on Saturday. They are believed to have had a register office ceremony earlier in the week and held the party to celebrate it with family and friends on Saturday. One of the musicians, who asked not to be named, said: ‘It was a beautiful day and we were playing on the terrace just after the photographs were taken. ‘The bride was in her gown in the garden with the groom and the fireworks just started going off. The flaming debris was falling all around. ‘The firework display was spectacular, but we were wondering why it was being held in the bright daylight. ‘Then we realised something shocking had happened. We grabbed our instruments and ran.’ He said ‘everyone was in complete shock’ and the bride was ‘obviously extremely upset.’ Scene: There were around 70 guests in the marquee, pictured, when the fireworks suddenly exploded . Panic: Police and firemen interviewed the 70 wedding guests who had been in the marquee at the time . Bridegroom: Insurance firm boss John Simpson, pictured on the website of his firm Simpson & Parsons, married Nicole Rothwell, 44 . Neighbour Enid Battersby said: ‘All of a sudden there was an enormous explosion. I have never heard anything like it since the blitz in Manchester.’ There then followed loud ‘booms and pops’ and thick smoke could be seen. It is understood there was going to be a big fireworks display later in the evening as the grand finale of the wedding celebration. Tourist Anthony Middleton was at the nearby Brockhole Visitor Centre with his family when they saw fireworks shooting into the sky. He said: ‘We heard this almighty explosion and the best way to describe that would be a series of earth-shaking cannons going off. 'The ground was shaking. We looked up and saw exhibition fireworks illuminating the daytime sky. That was followed by thick grey smoke and we obviously realised there was a fire nearby. ‘Explosions were going off all the time, we could see the fireworks coming out from behind the trees. It appeared to us the fireworks had been stored in this wooden building that was on fire. ‘We realised something disastrous was taking place. I could almost feel the heat of the fire.’ Another witness from the visitor centre said: ‘There was an explosion that sounded like thunder and then lots of fireworks went off. There were clouds of black smoke, we had no idea what happened.’ The national park visitor centre at Brockhole was packed with hundreds of tourists enjoying the last weekend of the summer holidays. Stuart Halliwell, the manager at the Treetop Trek Woodland Adventures on the site, said one of his staff helped evacuate wedding reception guests away from the fire scene. Explosion: The bride and groom were in the garden when flaming debris started to fly in their direction . Investigation: The man and woman have yet to be identified and police stayed late at the scene investigating . He said: ‘It must have been awful for the couple on their special day. It is obviously a tragedy but we could have been even worse than it was.’ The fire was in the grounds of the couple’s home Larch Cottage, at Ecclerigg. A fire service spokesman said four fire engines were sent to the scene to tackle a ‘well developed fire involving the two outbuildings.’ A Cumbria Police spokesman said they were called after a ‘shed containing fireworks was on fire.’ A vehicle nearby was also damaged by the blaze. ‘Two bodies, believed to be a male and a female, were found. Police and the fire service are investigating the circumstances that led to the fire.’ Detective Chief Inspector Mike Brown said: ‘We are still trying to examine the circumstances and the cause of the fire.’ Mr Simpson was a partner in a local insurance company which he co-founded 30 years ago. Crime scene investigators were still at the scene yesterday and the bride and groom were not available for comment.","John Simpson, 61, and Nicole Rothwell, 44, held party at lakeside home .

"By . Vanessa Allen . Star arrival: Jude Law was rushed into the Old Bailey to give evidence for the prosecution at the hacking trial in January . Jude Law was betrayed by a relative who sold information about his girlfriend’s affair with Daniel Craig, a court heard yesterday. It was only during yesterday’s proceedings that Law learned that the immediate family member was paid by the News of the World for details of the actor’s showdown with the James Bond star after Craig’s fling with Sienna Miller. In a dramatic moment at the Old Bailey, Law, 41, was handed a folded piece of paper containing the relative’s name and was asked if he knew they had spoken to the newspaper in 2005. His voice cracked slightly as he said he had come to know about it several years later, but had not known they had been paid. ‘I’m confused about what you are saying,’ he told Timothy Langdale, the QC defending former News of the World editor Andy Coulson in the phone hackling trial. ‘Are you asking whether I was aware of people being paid to get information? I wasn’t aware of it.’ Asked when he first heard his relative had taken money from the tabloid, he replied: ‘Today.’ The father of four appeared shaken as he was asked if he knew that his relative and others around him were paid to talk to the tabloid. The relative was said to have sold details about Law’s phone call to Craig, after he discovered the 007 actor’s affair with his then girlfriend Miss Miller. In an angry transatlantic call, Law was said to have berated Craig and demanded he should tell his own girlfriend, film producer Satsuki Mitchell, about his infidelity. Law said he had known Craig for ‘many, many years’ before he learned of the affair, which was made public a month after the phone call in a News of the World front page headlined ‘Sienna cheats on Jude’. In an awkward courtroom exchange, he agreed he had called his fellow actor about the fling in 2005.Mr Langdale said: ‘I’m not going to ask you the detail but no doubt you expressed your view of his behaviour?’ Scroll down for video . Court drama: Jude Law was shocked when he was handed a piece of paper containing the name of a family member who had sold information about him . Stars: Jude Law and Sienna Miller were among the most famous couples in Britain but split in 2005 after the affair was revealed . Affair: The Old Bailey heard that Daniel Craig and Sienna Miller, pictured together in Layer Cake, had a relationship and Jude Law called the James Bond star after he found out . Jude Law was asked about how the 2005 affair between Sienna Miller and Daniel Craig was revealed in the News of the World and if he knew a family member was secretly selling stories about him. Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC (AE) to Jude Law (JL): 'When was the first time that you heard the suggestion that a member of your family had passed information to the News of the World for money?' JL: 'Today.' AE: 'Can you tell me when it was discovered a relative had been in conversation with the News of the World about this story?. JL: 'That was in the autumn of last year, Initially it was from the (hacking) investigation, and when - confronted is too strong a word - a conversation was had with the relative they came up and admitted it had gone on. 'Admitted is maybe too strong a word, but I had never heard any money had been exchanged until today.' Timothy Langdale QC, (TL) defending Andy Coulson, asked Mr Law whether he knew about the affair in September 2005. TL: 'Were you aware there had been or was some sort of relationship between them?' JL: 'Yes, in and around that time, indeed I was.' TL: 'Did you telephone Daniel Craig and speak to him about it, at a time when he was in Baltimore? JL: 'Yes' TL: 'No doubt you expressed your view of his behaviour?  Did you make any reference to his then-girlfriend, somebody called Satsuki?' JL: 'I did, yeah. I do not remember if that was her name - Saski - more than likely, yes. We had known each other for many, many years, so the conversation took on all sorts of turns.' TL: 'You were not aware that a member of your immediate family was talking to the press, to the News of the World, about this story?'. JL: 'No I was not aware of that'. Mr Law was then handed a written note of the family member's name. AE: 'It was been suggested part of the tale of the phone call . to Daniel Craig came from sources close to you. Did you authorise that . exercise?' JL: 'No, in no way'. ‘I . did, yeah,’ the Oscar-nominated actor replied. ‘We had known each other . many, many years so the conversation took all sorts of turns.’ Mr . Langdale asked if Law had told Craig to tell his own girlfriend about . the fling. Law replied: ‘I think that’s correct, yes I think I did.’ He . appeared disdainful when he was asked to look at the News of the World . article about the affair. Mr Langdale told him: ‘I’m not going to ask . you to read every word of it.’ Law replied: ‘I would rather not.’ In . earlier evidence, Law described Miss Miller as ‘a friend’ who was his . girlfriend for several years after his 2003 divorce from actress Sadie . Frost. He said Miss Miller had been the one to tell him that one of his . entourage, a male employee, had been giving information about them to . the News of the World. But he said he was only told about his . relative’s dealings with the paper by the police last year, and had . spoken to the family member then. He said: ‘When a conversation was had . with the relative, they came and admitted what had gone on. ‘But as I said before, I had never heard any money had been exchanged until today.’ The . family member was not named in court and their identity was only . revealed to two barristers and the judge. Mr Langdale said the . relative’s identity should be protected because they were a confidential . journalistic source. A second piece of paper was also handed to Law, . containing the names of a publicist and the male employee who were said . to have been selling stories to the tabloid. He confirmed both names, . but added: ‘I was never aware that any money had changed hands.’ Law . said Press interest in his private life had increased dramatically . after his Oscar nomination for The Talented Mr Ripley in 2001 and the . subsequent breakdown of his marriage to Miss Frost. He said he had . suspected someone in his close circle was leaking information because . photographers apparently knew where he would be, even when he made . ‘secret’ arrangements for days out with his children. The jury has . heard he was the victim of phone hacking and was targeted by News of the . World private detective Glenn Mulcaire. Law said he was not surprised . to learn he had been hacked, as he had long believed someone had an . ‘unhealthy’ knowledge of his life. Coulson, 46, denies charges . relating to phone hacking at the News of the World and alleged corrupt . payments to officials. Six other defendants, including his predecessor . Rebekah Brooks, all deny charges against them. The jury has heard that . Mulcaire has pleaded guilty to conspiring to intercept voicemails. The trial continues.

"By . Laura Clark . A head teachers’ leader will today issue an unprecedented apology for historic child abuse scandals that ‘shame’ boarding schools. Ray McGovern will admit that revelations ‘cast a long shadow’ over today’s institutions. He will use his keynote speech as chairman of the Boarding Schools’ Association to apologise ‘unreservedly’ on behalf of the sector for past incidents of child abuse. He will also admit that boarding schools were a ‘closed world’ where reputation mattered more than the welfare of children. Victorian attitudes prevailed that resulted in children being ‘seen and not heard’ and disciplined in line with the belief that ‘sparing the rod’ spoiled the child. But Mr McGovern will say that modern schools cannot be judged on how they were in the 1950s, 60s and 70s and are now ‘unrecognisable’ from their predecessors. His apology follows revelations that 128 leading independent schools – mainly boarding schools – have been tainted by the scandal of child abuse. An investigation revealed in January that one or more men employed at 62 schools – including many elite boys’ public schools such as Haberdashers’ Aske’s, Wellington College and Ampleforth – have been convicted of abusing children over the past 20 years. Eton and Marlborough are among 30 schools where a male staff member has been convicted for possession of child porn. Another 36 schools have had their reputations tarnished by ongoing investigations, cases involving arrests but no charges, civil action for damages and staff abusing children who were not pupils. Mr McGovern, headmaster of St George’s School, a state day and boarding school in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, will address the issue at the BSA’s annual conference in Glasgow today. Eton College, on part called the Timbralls pictured, is one of 30 schools where a male staff member has been convicted for possession of child porn. 128 leading schools have been tainted by child abuse cases . ‘It shames me, and it shames the sector, that behaviour such as this happened or was allowed to happen, and for that I am unreservedly sorry,’ he will say. ‘I am sorry to those who were affected directly and to those who placed their trust in individuals who could not be trusted.’ Mr McGovern will say that schools are now much more closely regulated and that BSA members share a ‘genuinely different attitude’ towards child welfare. ‘Today’s boarding schools should not be judged by their predecessors of generations past. You wouldn’t judge a hospital now on the basis of how it was in the 1960s,’ he will announce. In his speech, Mr McGovern will also hit out at claims that boarding school pupils are not well prepared for real life and ‘can’t boil an egg or wash their own clothes’. ‘This is not my experience. I expect it’s not yours,’ he will say. And he will argue that universities and employers ‘increasingly look for more than top academic grades’. ‘They look for social skills and confidence, independence and resilience, character and perseverance. They look for true grit. You want all that as well outstanding exam results? No problem. That’s what we do,’ the audience will be told.","Ray McGovern is chairman of the Boarding Schools Association .
