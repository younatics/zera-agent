"The federal government has reportedly abandoned the controversial budget proposal to introduce a $7 co-payment on bulk billed GP visits  and will shelve the policy before the end of the year. Prime Minister Tony Abbott and his government are engaged in last-minute lobbying to save some of its key budget measures that have stalled in the hostile Senate with parliament due to rise for the year on December 4. It was understood the GP co-payment was under review and that the university overhaul was the subject of talks with Senate cross-benchers. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Tony Abbott has reportedly abandoned the controversial budget proposal to introduce a $7 co-payment on bulk billed GP visits . The ABC and other media outlets are reporting the unpopular co-payment is to be ditched in a 'barnacle' clearing exercise. The government announced the unpopular $7 doctor visit co-payment in the May budget. Of that $5 was to go into a proposed new Medical Research Future Fund. Pre-budget speculation pointed to a $15 co-payment, but the budget outcome prompted a barrage of criticism from welfare groups, Labor and many others. Minor party objections left the government most unlikely to get the measure through the Senate. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Tony Abbott told a joint party room meeting he was hopeful of clearing 'one or two barnacles' by the end of the year. He wasn't referring to a reshuffle though, but policy issues dragging on the government. A spokesman for health minister Peter Dutton said the reports on the GP co-payment were media speculation. The $7 co-payment on bulk billed GP visits will be shelved by the end of the year, according to reports . Prime Minister Tony Abbott and his government are engaged in last-minute lobbying to save some of its key budget measures that have stalled in the hostile Senate . Earlier this week, Prime Minister Tony Abbott (front left) told a joint party room meeting he was hopeful of clearing 'one or two barnacles' by the end of the year . The payment was criticised for discriminating against lower-income earners when it was unveiled in May, and it was also condemned by many doctors, who claimed it deterred them from bulk-billing. It failed to gain enough support from legislation to pass the Senate, and has been under review for several months. The coalition is also reportedly expected to make further changes to its $5.5 billion paid parental leave scheme, a signature policy for Mr Abbott. Comment was being sought from Prime Minister Tony Abbott's office. In an upbeat speech to the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry business leaders dinner in Canberra, Mr Abbott cited the government's achievements and gave no hint that he could be changing course on a key budget measure. 'By any fair measure it's been a successful year for the government. In politics there are no fair measures,' he said, prompting laughter from the audience.

"Nearly £5billion in council tax and business rates is owed to town halls which have failed to collect their dues, an inquiry found yesterday. It said that the £4.55billion that has gone unpaid is enough to build 300 secondary schools and that the failure to get the money will mean a ‘substantial’ impact on public services. Ministers said councils should do better in collecting their taxes and that the money lost could have been used to spare council tax payers from increases to their bills next year. Money owed by households: The biggest shortfall is over council tax, for which collection rates have dropped . The report by the Audit Commission said that £1.21billion of council tax and business rates went unpaid in the financial year that ended in March, and £3.34billion is still owed from earlier years. The biggest shortfall is over council tax, for which collection rates dropped last year. Councils lost £730million because council tax went unpaid last year, and the total missing is now £2.53billion. A reason for the falling proportion of council tax collected, the report said, lies in Coalition reforms which mean benefit claimants no longer have their local taxes paid automatically by Council Tax Benefit. Beginning last year, councils took over paying council tax support to welfare claimants, and some give more help more generously than others. Broadly, councils which are less generous with the new tax support payments found it more difficult to collect council tax. However the council tax collection rates were notably lower in some authorities than others. Lowest of all were the largely Labour-controlled metropolitan councils, which mainly run large cities in the midlands and the the north. One, unnamed, council is more than £100million behind in its council tax collection. Changes: The report said a reason for the falling proportion of council tax collected lies in Coalition reforms. Prime Minister David Cameron and Deputy PM Nick Clegg are seen at their first joint press conference in 2010 . Audit Commission chairman Jeremy Newman said: ‘Around one third of councils’ income comes from council tax and business rates. ‘While collection rates are high, at 97.0 and 97.9 per cent for council tax and business rates respectively, when we consider such large sums of taxpayers’ money, even a small percentage shift can produce substantial changes in the income councils have to deliver their services. ‘With £4.55 billion uncollected and individual council tax arrears ranging from £11.1million to £105.2million, there has to be room for improvement for many councils.’ Tory Local Government Minister Kris Hopkins said: ‘Improving tax collection rates and reducing arrears are a key way of making sensible savings to help keep overall council tax bills down and protect frontline services. ‘Every penny of tax that is not collected means a higher tax bill for the law-abiding citizen who does pay on time. ‘It is important that councils are sympathetic to those in genuine hardship, are proportionate in enforcement and do not overuse bailiffs, and we have published guidance for councils to stop unjustified, aggressive collection practices. ‘However, there is a significant potential source of income which councils across the country could use to support frontline services or freeze council tax bills next year.’ An average benchmark Band D council tax bill this year is £1,468, more than £100 a month for a family. Typically bills are lower – because most homes in the north of England fall below the Band D category – but the average household bill is still £1,045. Nevertheless council tax is considered an easy tax to collect because it is charged on properties which cannot run away and usually have someone living in them who is responsible for paying. Education: The report said the £4.55billion that has gone unpaid is enough to build 300 secondary schools . The Commission’s report said that despite this councils wrote off £195million in council tax last year because they decided it would be too expensive to collect. The write-off contributed to pushing up the amount of missing council tax by six per cent to £2.53billion. The Local Government Association which represents councils blamed the abolition of Council Tax Benefit for the shortfall. LGA chairman David Sparks said: ‘These figures confirm that council tax and business rates have among the highest collection rates of any tax. ‘The Exchequer would be billions of pounds better off each year if central government’s collection rates matched those of councils. ‘The slight increase in unpaid council tax will come as little surprise to those in local government, who warned that this would be a consequence of government cutting funding for council tax support. ‘This cut has left local authorities with little option but to reduce discounts for people on low incomes, some of whom have found it a struggle to pay. ‘The high collection rates for local taxes could be improved still further if government gave local areas more control over them. ‘If councils were able to set council tax discounts locally, we could ensure they are targeted at those who need them most.’ Council tax bills have been tightly controlled since the Coalition came to power. Authorities that want to push their bills up by more than two per cent are required to get the backing of voters in a local referendum.","Ministers say councils should do better in collecting their taxes .

"The small community of Jackfield in Shropshire was decimated by a monster landslide that engulfed 27 houses in thousands of tonnes of mud and soil in 1952. Now, more than 60 years later, the remains of eight houses, presumed to be lost forever under layers of silt, have been discovered by engineers working on a crumbling river bank. The properties were rediscovered during the excavation of the banks of the River Severn as part of a million-pound scheme to stabilise the area. Scroll down for video . The small community of Jackfield in Shropshire was decimated by the monster landslide, which engulfed 27 houses in thousands of tonnes of mud and soil in 1952. Now, over 60 years later, the remains of eight houses have been found, including a pretty tile floor dating from the 19th century (pictured) Workers at the site said they were amazed when they uncovered artefacts including an ornate Roman-style mosaic floor from a cottage, an intact bread oven and even an old kettle in the ruined houses. In particular, the patterned floors and elaborately decorated Art Nouveau tiles are thought to date back to the Victorian era and may have been made between 1890 and 1910. The deadly collapse of the village wreaked havoc in the close-knit community, which was dominated by its famous tile works. The first signs of the impending disaster were when nearby railway lines began to buckle and bend under the weight of the moving earth in late 1951. The first signs of the impending disaster were when nearby railway lines began to buckle and bend under the weight of the moving earth in late 1951. Soon afterwards, cracks began to appear in the walls of the village and within a few months 27 houses began sliding towards the River Severn. Rubble is pictured in 1951 . The patterned floors and elaborately decorated Art Nouveau tiles (picutred) are thought to date back to the Victorian era and may have been made between 1890 and 1910. Archaeologist Shane Kelleher, from Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust, said the houses may have belonged to people who worked at the tile factory . Patterned floors and elaborately decorated Art Nouveau tiles were found in the houses, which have been buried beneath tonnes of silt since 1952. The deadly landlside wreaked havoc in the close-knit community, which was dominated by its famous tile works. Archaeologist Shane Kelleher, from Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust, said: 'One of the things which strikes you is there are very many nice tiles, which suggests that the houses may have belonged to people who worked at the tile factory. ‘Jackfield was once a world centre for high-quality tiles and the people who worked there would probably have been given the tiles as a bonus to supplement their wages or would have been allowed to buy them very cheaply.’ He believes that the chequerboard-style floor discovered probably dates back to the late 19th century. Soon afterwards, cracks began to appear in the walls of the village and within a few months 27 houses began sliding towards the River Severn. Jackfield was used as a river port for nearby Broseley and Benthall and a railway was built in the region in 1605. It was renowned for its pottery and corn mills from the mid 17th century, which gradually expanded into the production of tiles in the early 19th century. Archaeologist Shane Kelleher, from Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust, said he was amazed at how well preserved the remains were after such a long period of time. ‘It is a very exciting find, we were expecting to maybe find a bit of rubble. 'We are surprised that is was so intact. ‘It’s a fascinating social history. 'It shows how tastes and styles have changed over the centuries. ‘One of the things which strikes you is there are very many nice tiles, which suggests that the houses may have belonged to people who worked at the tile factory. ‘Jackfield was once a world centre for high-quality tiles and the people who worked there would probably have been given the tiles as a bonus to supplement their wages or would have been allowed to buy them very cheaply.’ He believes the checkerboard-style floor discovered likely dates back to the late 19th century. Jackfield in Shropshire (shown on the map) was known for its quality tiles. The tiles were used to decorade Edwardian tube stations, children's hospitals and homes . The properties were rediscovered during the excavation of the banks of the River Severn as part of a £17.6million scheme to stabilise the area (pictured) Workers at the site were amazed when they uncovered artefacts including an ornate Roman-style mosaic floor from a cottage, an intact bread oven, and even an old kettle. The remains of a house is shown . ‘I would be pretty glad to have something like that in my house, so the people who lived here would probably have been very proud of it,’ Mr Kelleher said. ‘We found an old kettle, but there wasn’t that much stuff left behind. The people living here had a few months to get their belongings.' A young guardsman at Buckingham Palace was shocked to discover how a landslide was affecting his hometown of Jackfield when he watched a Pathe film in London in 1952. The film said: ‘In the roar of these floodwaters can be heard the sentence of death, not of a man but of a village in Shropshire’ and was accompanied by images of rubble, cracked walls and crumbling houses. Ron Miles, told The Shropshire Star that railway workers spotted the problem when the Severn Valley Railway line began to move. ‘They would be there every day with large crow bars, trying to move the track back.’ In the spring of 1952 the village was largely deserted after families were evacuated from their homes, which became cut off from other villages thanks to roads buckling. At the time, the disaster was blamed on clay mines that were dug in the local area, but geologists now think that the ‘young’ make-up of the Ironbridge Gorge generated the landslides. This explains why no bodies were expected to be found at the site. Project manager Neal Rushton said that 2,000 steel piles were being driven into the banks of the Severn to prevent the collapse happening again and that where possible, the foundations of the buildings will preserved for future generations. Work on the site began in October 2013 and it is expected to be completed by March 2016. Mr Kelleher (pictured) explained why so many titles were discovered in the houses. ‘Jackfield was once a world centre for high-quality tiles and the people who worked there would probably have been given the tiles as a bonus to supplement their wages or would have been allowed to buy them very cheaply,’ he said .","Twenty seven houses in Jackfield, Shropshire, were buried in 1952 .

"Lego is coming under fire from traditionalists with accusations its sets are reducing the scope for imagination and play. Bloggers and parents have become increasingly alarmed that its kits, whether it is Star Wars or Minecraft, involve building a specific model, using specialist pieces according to strict instructions. They worry it takes away the pleasure and ambition involved in a child just sitting with a box of bricks and creating something from their own imagination. Parents and bloggers complain that new Lego is not as good for children as the old fashioned plastic blocks . The debate has been triggered by British blogger, Chris Swan, who complained: ‘The problem is sets that only make one thing like a dragon or something licensed from a movie.’ The IT expert who was previously in the Royal Navy said: ‘I must have got my first Lego when I was about three or four. It was pretty basic stuff – mostly 4×2 blocks and a handful of 2×2 blocks. ‘I remember building a house out of it, and being shown by my mum to overlap the bricks to make a strong wall rather than building straight towers that would easily fall.’ He added: ‘Lego for me was always about creativity, remaking and improving on existing designs. Those things don’t happen with sets that are designed to build a model of a single thing. ‘But that’s not the only problem – Lego taught me the art of creative destruction – the need to break something in order to make something better. ‘Single outcome sets encourage preservation rather than destruction, and sadly that makes them less useful, less educational and in my opinion less fun.’ His comments coincide with the launch of The Brick 2014 show for Lego enthusiasts, which opens today in London. It appears his fears have some powerful advocates. The Nobel Prize-winning chemist Sir Harry Kroto argues that British-designed Meccano, which involves putting nuts and bolts together, is of greater educational value because it mimics real-life engineering. Blogger Chris Swan complained that the branded Lego gave children fewer options than ordinary blocks . He says: ‘There is no comparison. Children should start with Lego, which is basically a toy, and its basic units are bricks. We do not build cars and other machines out of bricks.’ The issue was highlighted by the BBC, where contributors to a Facebook discussion disagreed over the impact of the changes made by Lego in recent years. Graeme Gofton suggested it was evidence of dumbing down. He complained: ‘Even Lego now cannot let you think, you must build what they say. ‘In my day I had a bucket full and built my own x wing, shuttle, castle or anything I wanted. ‘Now you build what’s on the box and don’t you dare think for yourself and get creative you might grow up to be a thinker.’ Sarah Smith countered: ‘My son loves to follow the instructions, great for spatial learning. Once he’s played with it enough he dismantles and creates his own stuff.’ Lego spokesman Roar Rude Trangbaek  denied the sets are less creative. He said: ‘Children still get bricks and they can combine them. The bricks will probably end up in big boxes in homes and that acts like a pool of creativity.’ A Lego spokesman denied the claims suggesting the branded boxes inevitably get combined with other Lego . The brick count on the larger sets has risen in recent years. Top of Bricklink’s list is the model of the Taj Mahal, released in 2008, with 5,922 parts. This took over from a limited-edition Star Wars/M&Ms mosaic, sold in 2005, which had 5,462. The Star Wars Millennium Falcon of 2007 required the assembly of 5,174 pieces. Modern themed Lego sets linked to big budget films can be very expensive. For example, the LEGO Super Heroes Batcave comes in at £111.19, while the Lord of the Rings set called ‘The Battle of Helm’s Deep’ is £174.99. Its Star Wars sets remain hugely popular with a version of the Millennium Falcon costing £95. It is still possible to buy a box of bricks to allow youngsters to build their own toys and games. A 650 piece ‘Basic Bricks Deluxe’ box comes in at £20.99.","Parents are worried that Lego with instructions ruins a child's creativity .

"Films and TV shows like The Hunger Games and the Walking Dead have inspired reckless amateur hunters to use bows and arrows to maim animals, many of whom take several days to die in agony. The RSPCA says there has been a rise in the number of animals shot with arrows across Queensland over the past year. Spokesman Michael Beatty suspects popular TV shows with hunting themes such as Hunger Games, the Walking Dead and Game of Thrones may have inspired some to to take up the sport. The most recent incident - a pelican spotted with an arrow in its side at Lake Tinaroo, inland from Cairns - was reported to police on Tuesday morning. Films and TV shows like Hunger Games (pictured) and the Walking Dead have inspired reckless wannabe hunters to use bows and arrows to maim animals, many of which die in agony over several days . RSPCA came across a bird shot and killed with an arrow . The main character in The Hunger Games trilogy Katniss Everdeen, played by Jennifer Lawrence, is famously skilled with a bow and arrow, which she uses to hunt animals and defend herself in a fantasy game of life or death. The TV series The Walking Dead also features characters using bow and arrows to kill post-apocalyptic, flesh-eating zombies. Medieval drama series The Game of Thrones is also suspected of inspiring hunting amateurs. RSPCA Queensland spokesman, Michael Beatty, says TV shows like the Walking Dead (pictured) inspire hunters to use bows and arrows to maim animals . A bird is being treated at the RSPCA after being shot with an arrow . At least 10 animals, including possums (pictured), magpies, wallabies, a kangaroo and even a horse, have been killed or maimed in Queensland in this way over the past year . 'It has always gone on but seems to be more prevalent,' Mr Beatty said. 'They don't stop to think of the suffering that they're going to cause the animal.' Unless a person is highly skilled, animals are often injured and left die in pain over a number of days. At least 10 animals, including possums, magpies, wallabies, a kangaroo and even a horse, have been killed or maimed in Queensland by arrows over the past year. Most cases have been in the south east and there is generally a spike over the school holidays. Mr Beatty said attempts are being made to find the wounded pelican. 'If we can get it in time it might survive,' he said. In October two turkeys were put down after being shot with arrows in a horrifying incident at Carina Heights, south east of Brisbane.

RSPCA officers believe the animals would have suffered before being rescued and despite being treated at the local wildlife hospital, they had to be euthanised. An X-ray showed that the arrow had passed completely through the thorax of one of the turkeys, with its left lung likely to be affected. There are no laws against hunting with a bow and arrow, but a person can be prosecuted if it can be proved the animal has suffered - a difficult task if the animal is dead, Mr Beatty says. RSPCA NSW says it has also had several incidents in and around Sydney in the last few months. There have been goats, pelicans, cats, and birds shot with arrows.","RSPCA says there has been a rise in the number of animals shot with arrows and bows across Queensland in past year .

The team analysed 6.7 million Spotify playlists containing the word ‘workout’ in the title and compared the different beats per minute (bpm) to those used in certain workouts. For example, a person’s typical stride rate while jogging or running is 150 to 190 strides per minute.

Celebrity trainer Joey Gonzalez added: 'During workouts, an hour-long mix of strength training and treadmill-based cardio intervals, we try to match our runs and exercises to the beat of our music. ‘For example, timing the treadmill sprints to the chorus of a track with a great hook, or playing a slower song with bass for incline jogs, and even matching steady consistent beats for long endurance runs are all part of our strategy.’ Whereas rock music should be avoid during cardio and high-intensity workouts because the different changes in tempo can affect a person’s rhythm.

"There were charmingly affectionate scenes at the Chelsea Flower Show today, as Prince Harry warmly greeted his family with kisses as they attended the opening of his charity garden. It was something of a family jolly for the royals at today's VIP opening, and aside from the glorious displays of blooms, it was a chance to offer a show of support to the  unexpected garden designer - Prince Harry. The 28-year-old helicopter pilot was at Chelsea for the first time with his charity Sentebale, which hopes its African-inspired garden will highlight its work aids orphans in the impoverished kingdom of Lesotho. Scroll down for video . It was something of a family jolly for the royals at today's VIP opening of the Chelsea Flower Show, as Prince Harry greeted his father with a kiss . Aside from the glorious displays of blooms, it was a chance to offer a show of support to an unexpected garden designer - Prince Harry, who seemed extremely happy to see his family . The affectionate mood was clearly infectious as the Prince of Wales greets the Duke of Edinburgh with a half hug and kiss during a tour of the B&Q Sentebale Forget-Me-Not Garden . It is the first time that Sentebale has undertaken such a project and the prince has been closely involved in its creation – even examining designs emailed to him by designer Jinny Blom while stationed on the frontline in Afghanistan. First up was Uncle Andrew and his daughter, Princess Beatrice, who said afterwards: 'I think it is beautiful and loved the story behind it.' Next was Uncle Edward - who had to be torn away from the strimmer display, according to Harry - with his father and step-mother hot on his heels. Charles looked proud as punch at his son's efforts and told him:'This is the great garden is it, after all that effort? I was wondering if it didn't exist.' Not to be left out the Duchess of Cornwall leans in for a friendly welcome too . And she was even treated to a peck on both of her cheeks by Prince Philip . Princess Beatrice also met with Prince Harry at the RHS Chelsea Flower Show, where he unveiled the Sentebale garden . Harry couldn't resist jesting with his father: 'If there is anything here which might catch your eye we could probably come to a deal. You can't have it, but we can come to a deal.' 'A deal?! ' said Charles with mock outrage. The Prince of Wales then joked that the large round stone that is one of the main features of the garden could be a dance floor. It was only then that Harry noticed his grandfather, Prince Philip, waiting to come in. 'Looking they're even queuing,' he joked. When Charles failed to notice the other VIP guest, Harry ribbed him: 'Err, pa, meet your father!',  prompting Charles to look up with an exclamation of surprise. The Prince of Wales was heard joking that the large round stone that is one of the main features of the garden could be a dance floor . The prince even teased Philip that a circular stone centrepiece to his garden span round with flashing lights rather like a nightclub podium . 'You were meant to be looking at strimmers and tractors, Grandpa, I didn't know you were coming. Fantastic!' said Harry. 'Hopefully you like it. You've been coming here for years and your opinion is highly regarded.'Are we going to see any of this at Sandringham or Balmoral?' The prince even teased Philip that a circular stone centrepiece to his garden span round with flashing lights rather like a nightclub podium. 'Really?' Philip enquired earnestly. 'No, Grandpa, they wouldn't let us,' Harry joked. Last to arrive was the Queen who delighted at her grandson's efforts but apparently told Harry to send a few plants to his father's Stumpery at Highgrove as he 'needed a bit of greenery'. When the Queen stood with her grandson on the stone circle, which is decorated with hearts and crowns, he told her: “Pa thought it was going to spin round – but sadly it doesn’t. Miss Blom, who has been working on the design since last August with Harry, said afterwards: 'The Queen liked it. The Prince of Wales would like the plants in the middle to go to the stumpery at Highgrove. The Queen thinks it needs it – it needs some greenery. So we are going to send them down.' She added: 'She has been coming here (to Chelsea) for nearly 60 years. She said she thought it might be her sixtieth year. Prince Harry gives the Queen a tour of the garden. It is the first time that Sentebale has undertaken such a project and the prince has been closely involved in its creation . The Queen was delighted at her grandson's efforts but apparently told Harry to send a few plants to his father's Stumpery at Highgrove as he 'needed a bit of greenery' The Queen stood with her grandson on the stone circle, which is decorated with hearts and crowns as a tribute to his mother . Sentebale was set up by Harry in 2006 following a gap year visit to the tiny - and hugely impoverished - African kingdom of Lesotho. He was so moved by the experience that he vowed to spend the rest of his life helping the youngest victims of the country’s HIV/AIDS epidemic. Sentebale was set up by Harry in 2006 following a gap year visit to the tiny - and hugely impoverished - African kingdom of Lesotho . In a country of just 1.8 million people, 23 per cent of adults are HIV positive and their life expectancy has plummeted to just 41 – leaving almost a generation orphaned. The name Sentebale was chosen as it means ‘forget me not’ in the language of Lesotho, a tribute to both Harry’s mother and that of the children themselves. The charity hopes that by showing at Chelsea it will raise its profile and fundraising activities. The garden’s creator, Jinny Blom, said she had been inspired by the landscape of Lesotho itself as well as Harry’s experience of losing his mother Diana, Princess of Wales A pattern of hearts and crowns has been engraved on a circular terrace in the garden, acting as a memorial to the late princess.","Prince Harry was at Flower Show for the first time with his charity Sentebale .

"Dehydration is defined as a shortage of water in the body ¿ but the European Food Standards Authority decided the statement could not be allowed . Drinking water does not ease dehydration, the European Union has ruled – and anyone who disagrees faces two years in prison. The decision – after three years of discussions – results from an attempt by two German academics to test EU advertising rules which set down when companies can claim their products reduce the risk of disease. The academics asked for a ruling on a convoluted statement which, in short, claimed that water could reduce dehydration. Dehydration is defined as a shortage of water in the body – but the European Food Standards Authority decided the statement could not be allowed. The ruling, announced after a conference of 21 EU-appointed scientists in Parma and which means that bottled water companies cannot claim their product stops people’s bodies drying out, was given final approval this week by European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso. Yesterday, Tory MEP Roger Helmer said: ‘This is stupidity writ large. The euro is burning, the EU is falling apart and yet here they are worrying about the obvious qualities of water. If ever there were an episode which demonstrates the folly of the great European project, then this is it.’ Under British law, advertisers who make health claims that breach EU law can be prosecuted and face two years in jail. The decision was being hailed as the daftest Brussels edict since the EU sent down laws on how bendy bananas should be. UKIP MEP Paul Nuttall said: ‘I had to read this four or five times before I  believed it. Careful consideration: European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso gave final approval to the 21 scientists' ruling this week . ‘It is a perfect example of what Brussels does best. Spend three years, with 20 separate pieces of correspondence before summoning 21 professors to Parma, where they decide with great solemnity that drinking water cannot be sold as a  way to combat dehydration.’ He added: ‘Then they make this judgment law and make it clear that if  anybody dares sell water claiming that it is effective against dehydration they  could get into serious legal bother. ‘This makes the bendy banana law look positively sane.’ The statement on which the eminent EU experts ruled claimed that ‘regular consumption of significant amounts of water can reduce the risk of development of dehydration and of concomitant decrease of performance.’ However the Parma gathering ruled: ‘The panel considers that the proposed claim does not comply with the requirements for a disease risk reduction claim.’ It declared that shortage of water in the body was just a symptom of  dehydration. Dr Andreas Hahn and Dr Moritz Hagenmeyer of the Institute for Food Science and Human Nutrition at Hanover Leibniz University said they were unhappy but  not surprised. ‘We fear there is something wrong in the state of Europe,’ Professor Hahn  said. He added that the academics had been trying to test the working of EU food and advertising rules. ‘It was free of charge, there was no apparent red tape attached and it gave  food business operators, whom we regularly advise, a chance to advertise their products in a new way,’ he added. ‘We thought we should give it a try and see  what would happen. ‘But over almost four years, it became clear that the procedure was anything but straightforward. Any company depending on the claim would long have gone  out of business. What is our reaction to the outcome? Let us put it this way: We are neither surprised nor delighted.’ He said: ‘The European Commission is wrong; it should have authorised the  claim. That should be more than clear to anyone who has consumed water in the past, and who has not?’","UKIP MEP Paul Nuttall: ‘I had to read this four or five times before I believed it.

"A co-pilot made a miraculous escape from a plane crash in Iceland that killed the other two occupants – and footage of the incident has been released for the first time.

"A once bustling gold rush town in Mono County, California, now stands deserted - many of the buildings lie abandoned, yet are still furnished with the personal belongings of their previous owners. The town of Bodie was named after Waterman Body, who first found gold there in 1859. By its peak in the 1880s, it was a bustling gold rush town with a population of around 10,000.

All the buildings were fascinating, from the workshops full of tools to the shop with products still on display. The morgue was morbid but captivating, with dusty coffins stacked up.

'The school was probably one of my favourites as it gave me a lot of things to research; I loved the old cracked globe in the school window especially.' Cat says: 'Most people I show these images to are really fascinated by Bodie. These are the places that most of us only hear about in films or stories, but to see one up close and be able to show other people how it looked is wonderful. 'The workshops had all sorts of rusty containers and tools, and a lot of the houses still had old beds, chairs and tables in, as well as personal belongings. 'The school had a fully furnished classroom, complete with writing on the boards and books on the desks. It is so full of items it looks like everyone just vanished midway through a lesson.'

"It remains a shocking statistic that, according to the charity WomensAid, one incident of domestic violence is reported in the UK every minute. Even more horrifying is that two women are killed at the hands of a former or current partner every single week. With the issue raging on Avon have launched the #wallofsilence campaign aimed at raising awareness and encouraging victims to speak out against domestic violence. Avon have launched a new campaign aimed at encouraging women to speak out against domestic violence. The singe Sophie Ellis-Bexter is one of many celebrities who have chosen to support the cause . Actress Gillian Anderson was keen to show her support for the cause tweeting her 'shhh' selfie . The cosmetics company are urging people to share their 'shhh' selfies, holding one finger up their mouths in the picture. The pose represents how victims of domestic violence often feel like they have been silenced. For every picture that is posted Avon, who launched the campaign with Glamour magazine, will donate £1 to domestic abuse charities with the images creating a 'wall' of photographs on the brand's website. The campaign, which so far has proved hugely popular with celebrities such as Gillian Anderson, Tamzin Outhwaite and Sophie Ellis-Bexter, works in conjunction with WomensAid and Refuge. Both charities work tirelessly to end not only violence against women but against children also. Even the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg showed his support for the campaign posted a selfie to Twitter. Wall of Silence is the latest latest charitable move from Avon who launched their Speak Out Against Domestic Violence project  in 2009. Over the last five years they have raised an amazing £1.5million for women's charities. The original idea came from a Glamour reader named Charli Bailey who decided to speak out about her abusive ex partner. It's not just about getting women involved, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg also tweeted his support . Nicole Appleton posted her 'shhh' selfie, for every selfie posted Avon will donate £1 to charities providing care and support for women and children who have been victims of domestic violence . Former Made In Chelsea star and jewellery designer Ashley James joined the wall of selfies . Charlie said of her brave choice: 'My Wall of Silence campaign is about everyone in society coming together and taking a stand not only against domestic violence but the fact that we are not talking enough about a crime that kills two women in the UK every week.' Andrea Slater, general manager Avon UK commented: 'As the company for women, Avon is proud to speak out against domestic violence, a so often hidden crime that effects 1 in 4 women in the UK. 'Charlie's Wall of Silence campaign provides the perfect opportunity to use the power of social media to spread the word that this issue cannot remain behind a wall of silence. 'We will continue to raise funds and awareness of this cause until women and children are safe.' Polly Neate, Chief Executive Women's Aid said of the campaign: 'Charlie's Wall of Silence idea is wonderful because it reflects how many women experiencing domestic violence feel, completely silenced by their abuser and afraid to speak out to their friends and family. Actress Tamzin Outhwaite shared the important message with her fans . 'This will not only raise vital funds but lifesaving awareness, as so many women living in abusive relationships do not know what they are experiencing 'counts' as domestic violence.' Sandra Horley CBE, CEO Refuge added: 'We still have a long way to go before domestic violence is truly treated as a serious crime. Campaigns like this are vital - they help to raise awareness and reach out to women living with fear.' The Wall of Silence idea is the latest in a long line of campaigns which have utilised social media in order to spread their message. Earlier this year thousands took part in the ALS Ice Bucket challenge to raise awareness for those suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. People including Victoria Beckham and Anna Wintour filmed themselves tipping buckets of ice cold water over their heads and the campaign raised over £600million. Similarly the #nomakeupselfie challenge made £8million for Cancer research with stars like Millie Mackintosh and Holly Willoughby getting in on the action.","New viral campaign encourages people to post 'shhh' selfies .

"US celebrities called for a boycott to take place Friday -- one of the busiest US shopping days -- to protest a grand jury's decision not to prosecute a police officer who fatally shot a black teen.

Black Friday is a day of deep commercial discounts and frenzied shopping which takes place each year after the Thursday Thanksgiving holiday in the United States. The planned campaign calls for a one-day moratorium on spending to protest what it calls 'staggering' human rights violations in the United States, including police brutality. The boycott was prompted by widespread outrage after a grand jury on Monday failed to indict a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri who shot and killed black 18-year-old Michael Brown in August. Protests erupted across the US after the decision. America's 43 million black citizens will hold about $1.1 trillion in purchasing power by 2015, a Nielsen study said.

"Many BMW fans will likely be horrified by the customised 'paint job' that this Z4 has endured. But a rare few may actually love it. At the very least it's difficult not to appreciate the amount of work that has gone into this dragon auto-job. A matter of taste: To some this might be their dream BMW 'paint-job' but it's unlikely to appeal to the masses . The scaly vehicle is made from yak bone, each scale decorated or painted gold . But effort is no guarantee of achievement, and its questionable whether anyone would genuinely be seen in this vehicle. Or whether it could still get anywhere near the Z4's usual top speed of 156mph. Sprayed a gaudy gold, the BMW Z4 has then painstakingly been adorned with the limbs of a dragon, including legs and feet with golden claws, wings on the scissor doors, a tail that sashays behind it and a bonnet that is covered in scales. Each and every scale is made from the bone of China's indigenous mountain yak, and is designed with a dragon-inspired pattern. The dragon's claws clasp around the car's wheels . A fiery tail sashays from the Z4's boot . It might be eye-catching, but whether or not the vehicle performs well is another question, given the excess weight from the bone, and resistance from the design. The unique design was on display last week at the China Import and Export Fair, in the southern Guangdong province. It's not known if this model was for sale - and if so, if it sold - but it certainly stood out from the crowd.

The sloppy mix of rain and snow rolled into the Northeast on Wednesday just as millions of Americans began the big Thanksgiving getaway. Numerous traffic accidents were reported across the Northeast, where by midafternoon the line between rain and snow ran roughly along Interstate 95, the chief route between Washington and Boston. Schools and businesses also closed in some areas, and state government offices let workers go home early.

Pat Green and her husband drove from Saugerties, New York, to the Albany airport for the first leg of their trip to San Francisco. She said the drive on the New York State Thruway was 'a little hairy,' but they made it, and their flight was on schedule so far. 'It was snowing so hard you couldn't see the car ahead of you,' she said. 'We slowed down so we were fine. We also give ourselves a lot of extra time.' Major Northeast cities were likely to see moderate to heavy rain most of the day, though New York could see 1 to 4 inches of snow, and its northern suburbs 6 to 8 inches, the National Weather Service said. Higher elevations west of the I-95 corridor could see as much as 6 to 12 inches. Dan Albert hoped to beat the snow as he, his wife and 15-year-old daughter refueled their SUV Wednesday morning along I-81 in Hagerstown, Maryland, about halfway between their Greensboro, North Carolina, home and their Thanksgiving destination in Mahwah, New Jersey.

An estimated 41.3 million travelers are expected to hit the nation's highways between Wednesday and Sunday, a 4.3 percent increase over last year, according to AAA. Kevin Roth, a meteorologist at The Weather Channel said the conditions in areas can change dramatically. Roth said the cut-off line between heavy and light snow was likely to be very abrupt. 'Someone could go from an inch in the southeast of a city and drive 10 miles northwest and find themselves in more than 10 inches,' he said, reports NBC News.

"Last week, she joined the Pope to call for a solution to the problem of malnutrition and today, Queen Letizia was back in action, this time in an effort to get more people to volunteer. The 42-year-old joined charity bosses for the State Volunteering Congress in Palma on the island of Mallorca, where she also presented a series of awards. Attending the event is something of a tradition for the royal, who last year joined delegates in Pamplona while still plain Princess Letizia. Glamorous: Letizia was businesslike in a tailored grey dress for the event in the Mallorcan capital, Palma . Tradition: Letizia also attended the State Volunteering Congress last year while she was still Princess Letizia . As at last year's event, which was held in Pamplona, she opted for a businesslike look and wore a neatly tailored grey dress teamed with her favourite £275 Hope Egg earrings by British brand, Links of London. The annual conference is aimed at raising the profile of volunteers and about encouraging more people to sign up and help out with charity projects across Spain. Letizia, who has built a reputation for championing charity causes since her marriage in 2004, is no stranger to volunteering herself and helps out on a Red Cross stand  on Spanish National Day. In addition to the Red Cross, top causes for Letizia include poverty and children's issues, and she also works closely with the Spanish government on matters pertaining to disability. She is also a champion of Spanish culture and, last month, travelled to Austrian capital Vienna to launch an exhibition dedicated to 17th century painter, Diego Velázquez. Favourites: Along with volunteering, Letizia also champions children's charities and the disabled . Culture: The royal is also a supporter of the arts and culture, and travelled to Vienna for a launch last month . Stylish: Letizia has won plaudits for her chic sense of style since becoming Queen in June this year . During the launch, Letizia, who has worked hard to master English and French since marrying Felipe, made a brief speech in German before continuing in English. The Spanish royals have had a busy few months since taking the top job in June and this week has proved no exception, with both Letizia and Felipe appearing at a number of events. Among them was a reception held to mark the 75th anniversary of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) in Madrid. The  couple were joined at the event by the Spanish minister of the Economy and Finance, Luis de Guindos, who stopped for a chat in the auditorium before the event began. The Spanish National Research Council, where the couple made their appearance, is the largest public institution dedicated to research in Spain and the third largest in Europe.

It also manages an extensive network of specialist libraries and has research centres spread around the country. Unusually, however, neither half of the royal couple has ventured outside of Spain - instead confining themselves to touring their native country. Since June, the couple have visited France, Morocco and the Netherlands as well as their most recent trip - a tour of Luxembourg and Belgium two weeks ago.

"A Swedish family suffered the shock of a lifetime when they discovered that the 'kitchen mouse' that had their cat running around in circles was in fact a gigantic monster rat. The Bengtsson-Korsås family first noticed something was wrong when their cat Enok refused to enter the kitchen in their flat in Solna, north-west Stockholm. The rat measured 15 inches, without its tail, and had made it into the family’s flat by gnawing a tunnel between a wooden panel and concrete. Ratigan: The gigantic rat measured 15in from nose to the base of its tail, and made its way into the flat in north Stockholm by chewing through the wall . The family did not discover their gigantic guest until it was time to take out the bins. ‘I was terrified. It was so huge that I barely saw what it was and I jumped up on the kitchen table,’ Signe Bengtsson-Korsås told Aftonbladet. The rat had made itself comfortable behind the family’s dishwasher and even caused a leak by chewing its way through the waterpipes. Despite attempts from Mrs Bengtsson-Korsås and her two children to scare the rodent, the ‘Viking rat’ only grew bolder and eventually dared to venture out on the kitchen floor. Viking rat: The monster rat, so big it scared family's cat refused to enter the kitchen for days, chewed through the pipes behind the dishwasher and even lived for several minutes after it was caught in a trap . Exterminators were called in and placed industry-sized traps to catch the rat, and less than a day later one of them snapped. However, when the family checked, the trap was gone. The rat was so powerful that it had carried the trap with it, snapped around its neck. ‘It didn’t die when it went into the trap, but scurried away. It went underneath a wooden plant, where it got stuck and choked itself to death,’ Mr Bengtsson-Korsås said. ‘It was the biggest rat I have ever seen, and it looked like itwas in good shape as the fur was nice,’ he added.","A 15-inch 'Viking rat' caught in a suburb to the Swedish capital .

"It should be a time of festive joy and cheer but for many people Christmas can be a pretty lonely time of year... especially if you've just been dumped.

This can also apply to relationships resulting in them ending with their partner.If you're the person left behind, you need to really think about whether you were having those same niggles too but perhaps brushing them to one side. Was the relationship in a rut, were you just going with the motions?

'Christmas is a prime ""meet the family"" time,' says Laura, 'It depends on how new the relationship is of course, but if you've been together a while and the time is appropriate to meet the family yet they suddenly end the relationship, this suggests that they didn't want it to get this serious this soon - or not at all and so slammed on the breaks. 'Meeting the family can signify taking the relationship to the next stage. It's likely that they just didn't want that.'If you find yourself dumped for this reason, although it hurts now, just keep in mind it's for the best, as the two of you clearly had different visions about where the relationship was going. 'It's better that it ended sooner rather than later where you would have got even more invested in it. If your partner was concerned that it was moving too quick, they should have communicated this to you so that you could both discuss how or if to move forwards together. You're better off being single (even at Christmas!) than in a relationship that isn't right for you.' ...But they also don't want you to meet theirs . Laura Yates is a relationship expert and break up coach who helps people heal their heartbreak . This family issue isn't one sided, claims Laura: 'The idea of introducing you to their family can also highlight to them just how serious the relationship is getting. It could force them to evaluate it and realise it isn't what they want. There might also be an element of them worrying about what their family think of you.' 'If you've been finished with and you think this could be the reason, try hard to not get into the ""I'm not good enough"" mindset. You are! Don't you want to be with someone who can't wait to introduce you to their family? You're a catch and you want to be with someone who treats you as such! 'If the reason is that they are worried about what their family will think of you, wouldn't you rather be with someone who has their own mind and stands up for who and what they want? Again, perhaps lack of communication about the relationship was missing. It looks like the two of you had very different visions, so you're much better out of this now and can go into the new year with a fresh start.' They don't want to buy you a gift . Laura explains that whilst this may seem like a ridiculous reason to break up with someone, it can reveal bigger issues about the relationship. She says: 'It can force your partner to realise how little effort they want to spend on finding you the perfect gift and lead them to think about how much they really value the relationship. 'Or it can be as simple as the fact they’re selfish! If you are the one who has been dumped for this reason, you're much better off being single than with someone who doesn't value you enough. It's not about expensive gifts (or shouldn't be) but more the thought that goes into them, and if they can't put the effort in, they're not the right person for you. Use the money or time you were going to spend on them on yourself this Christmas instead!' The curse of the Christmas party affair . Although we might not like to admit it there is a chance that you might fail prey to a Christmas affair. 'The work Christmas party is prime one for cheeky kisses under the mistletoe…and sometimes more,' Laura explained. 'People can get carried away in the haze of the free champagne and go on to do something they may regret.' 'How to deal with this one if you find yourself being the victim of being cheated on? Well, Christmas or not, cheating is cheating! Although it hurts now, you've had a lucky escape as you don't want to be with someone who after a few glasses of free booze will be tempted to stray' Laura says that even if you do go through a break up this Christmas it doesn't mean you have have to give up all hope. Here's her top five tips for getting through the festive season on your own: . 1. Appreciate your family . Laura says: 'Christmas is a time for family and friends so make an effort to reconnect with them and enjoy the time you spend with them. Really try and appreciate this time because it’s what Christmas is all about.' 2. Socialise! Laura says: 'Christmas is the one time of year where you can get dressed up to your heart's content and if you're single, you can go exactly where you want and when. Pamper yourself, treat yourself to an amazing outfit for the season, do things for yourself that make you feel great and get some social events to look forward to in the diary with friends.' Laura says that socialising with your friends is a great way to pull yourself out of the post split blues . 3. Lend a helping hand . Laura says: 'Volunteer or do something for others. If you're feeling down about being single at Christmas, do something positive for someone else. Whether it's helping out at a local charity over Christmas or volunteering for a few hours at a shelter, it will be amazing how much of a renewed perspective you'll get.' 4. Set goals . Laura says: 'Christmas and New Year are the perfect time for thinking about changes you want to make in the year ahead. If you don't want to be single, what can you do to change that? Can you try online dating, go to singles events or plan to do things that will widen your social circle and greater your chances of meeting someone? Aim to do things that will make you feel more fulfilled in general. Try new things. You're far more likely to meet someone who you really connect with when you have positive things going on in your life than when you're dwelling on being single. 5.Embrace the term 'single' Don't stress and see it as a positive! Right now, you can't change the fact that you're single but you can change the way you perceive it. You have complete freedom to do what you want, when you want so make the most of that! Now is the time that you have the ability to be completely selfish about doing what you want - for you, so embrace it! If this is your first Christmas being single and you're finding it hard, do something or go somewhere during the holiday season out of the ordinary to mark a new start and create fresh memories.","Laura Yates says break ups can come for a number of different reasons .

"The Duke of Cambridge is to visit China for the very first time early next year, Kensington Palace has confirmed. William will travel to the country at the end of February and return to the UK in early March, but will be without the Duchess of Cambridge, who will be almost eight months pregnant. The Duke will spend three days in Japan and carry out a series of engagements in Tokyo before travelling to China for a three-day visit - much of which will be spent in Beijing. Scroll down for video . Visit: Prince William, pictured with Harry Styles, will visit China and Japan early next year . Staying at home: The Duchess of Cambridge, who will be almost eight months pregnant, is not going . William will become the first senior royal to visit China, since the Queen and Prince Philip who spent time there in 1986. That visit wasn't entirely without hiccups, with Prince Philip overheard describing Beijing as 'ghastly' and later making his infamous 'slitty eye' quip to a British student living there. Prince Charles, who is a supporter of the Dalai Lama, has never been to mainland China but did travel to Hong Kong for the handover ceremony in 1997. William’s trip will put the spotlight on his father’s uneasy relationship with China and also raise questions about why Charles has yet to make an official visit to the republic. A high profile tour by the Duke of Cambridge will be viewed as an attempt to improve diplomatic relations with the country and comes after the red carpet was rolled out for Chinese prime minister Li Keqiang when he visited London in June. Despite not being head of state, the Chinese politician reportedly demanded a private audience with the Queen and even threatened to cancel the trip if it didn't happen. Unlike the Queen, who did eventually meet with Mr Li, Charles’s dealings with China have been troubled in the past, particularly after he described China’s leaders as 'appalling old waxworks' in a leaked diary. In 1999, he was accused of boycotting a Chinese state visit to the UK by failing to attend a banquet held for the then-president Jiang Zemin. During a visit from Mr Jiang's successor, Hu Jintao in 2005, Charles carefully side-stepped the issue by being out of the country on a tour of the US on the night of the official dinner. He did not meet Mr Hu on the remaining two days of his visit. Four years later, Charles did meet Mr Hu but during a meeting held at the Mandarin Oriental in Knightsbridge rather than at his London home, Clarence House. Flying solo: Prince William is no stranger to travelling alone and visited Malta without his wife in September . Boost: The UK Government hope the visit will improve relations between London and Beijing . Boycott: Prince Charles, seen here at the 1997 Hong Kong handover, is yet to travel to China . Unimpressed: Charles, seen here in Hong Kong in 1992, is unimpressed by China's treatment of Tibet . During the meeting, he raised the subject of Tibet, whose exiled leader, the Dalai-Lama, Charles is known to admire. 2009 also saw Charles sanction the opening of The Prince’s Charities Foundation (China) in Beijing - a move seen as a step towards a friendlier relationship with the country. The Prince’s Foundation for the Built Environment also worked with Chinese planning authorities and a university on a restoration project. Although the Queen remains diplomatic in her dealings with Chinese visitors, the Duke of Edinburgh, much like his son, has been freer with his opinions. Welcome: The Queen and Prince Philip welcomed former Chinese president Hu Jintao to London in 2005 . Ghastly! Prince Philip's verdict on Beijing, overheard during a 1986 state visit to China with the Queen . During a 1986 tour of China, Philip was overheard describing Beijing as 'ghastly' and told British exchange students: 'If you stay here much longer you’ll all be slitty-eyed.' The same year, he told a World Wildlife Fund meeting: 'If it has four legs and it’s not a chair, if it’s got two wings and it flies but is not an aeroplane and if it swims and it’s not a submarine, the Cantonese will eat it.' Most recently, in 2010, on hearing that President Obama had had dinner with the presidents of Russia and China, he quipped: 'How can you tell the difference between them?'","Prince William will travel to China and Japan next February .

"As the protests slowly begin to die down in Ferguson and other cities around the country, some people are trying to find hope and spread a message of love in the aftermath of the destruction. Among those people is a high school student, Molly Rodgers, who has begun painting boarded up and damaged businesses in the Ferguson area with positive messages. This after spending the week helping to clean up the streets of the city. Amazing teen: Molly Rodgers (above) a 17-year-old high school student, has been painting messages of hope on boarded up and destroyed businesses in Ferguson . Hope: Rodgers writes 'love will win' on the boards, and was out doing this all day Wednesday . Destroyed: One of the businesses Rodgers visited was Cathy's Kitchen, which was vandalized on Monday, but boarded up the next day by residents who volunteered . 'I think there’s a lot more love out here than people realize, so yesterday I went out and bought a bunch of paint, and today I’m here painting up the boarded-up windows,' she told local reporter Ryan J. Reilly. She said this as she painted boards outside Cathy’s Kitchen with the phrase 'love will win.' The establishment, located right next to the Ferguson Police Department, had been vandalized and had windows broken during the protests earlier in the week. Rodgers, who lives just minutes away in Hazelwood, spent all day Wednesday painting the very same message across the city. 'I think it’s unfortunate, I think it’s really rough, but I think a lot of love has come out of it, a lot of community,' said the wise-beyond-her-years teen. 'It’s been really weird, because it’s like my home even if I live in Hazelwood.' Winter wonderland: Across town, a boarded up resale shop was painted by the owner . Hopeful message: Karen Gold said she wanted to create a peaceful winter wonderland . Good message: 'I just wanted to make it beautiful and know that we’re still here and that we still support the community,' said Gold . Across town, Karen Gold, who boarded up her own store, the resale shop Honey and Sweeties, was doing the same thing and painting a peaceful winter wonderland. 'I just wanted to make it beautiful and know that we’re still here and that we still support the community,' she said. 'We hope for a peaceful resolution.'

"Whilst Sarah Jessica Parker may look nothing short of fabulous in her new shoot, she has revealed that in real life she is nothing like her super stylish alter ego Carrie Bradshaw. Speaking to Harper's Bazaar Arabia the 49-year-old actress and shoe designer said: 'I’m not an expert on women, on sex, on dating, on romance. I just played one. 'I’m not interrogative that way; it’s not the way I talk to my friends. I have friendships that are intimate and hopefully I have a good ear for them. But I don’t know what general issues are for women.' Scroll down for video . Promoting her new shoe range in Harper's Bazaar Arabia Sarah Jessica Parker spoke about how she feels the comparisons between her and her on-screen character Carrie Bradshaw . SJP wore a number of different looks for the shoot, wearing shoes from her own 'SJP Collection' Explaining the she finds it difficult when people expect her to be just like Carrie, Sarah revealed that she does not like to give her friends guidance. In Sex and The City Carrie had a longstanding column for fictional newspaper The New York Star in which she would proffer her musings on love, life and NYC. However, whilst Sarah may not be into doling out advice like Carrie, one thing they definitely have in common is their love of fancy footwear. In fact, SJP has her own line of shoes and handbags including a 25 piece collection  designed with the help of George Malkemus, CEO of Manolo Blahnik. The collection even includes a t-bar sandal named after her famous character. Sarah has previously revealed that she wanted the pieces to be simple and that she and George have always shared the same vision. 'There's decades and decades and decades of incredible imagery that you probably have in your head that's meaningful to you. 'It just so happens that George and I shared the same period of interest,' she said, 'I wanted to go back in time to the simple shoe, which is really hard to do well. That was really our point of inspiration.' Carrie Bradshaw was known as much for the advice she would give her friends as the outlandish clothing that she would wear . Sarah Jessica Parker spoke at length in the interview about her love for her family and how difficult it can be to work away from her children . Sarah wears a beautiful bow backed dress as she travelled to Dubai for the shoot . Sarah covered Harper's Bazaar Arabia after travelling to Dubai for the first week . And with the collection, says Sarah, comes great business experience: 'I’ve learned about when things are complicated in business, how best to get a yes,' she revealed to Harper's. 'How to navigate relationships that are unfriendly, stressful, combative. I’ve learned about private financing and business, and what their expectations are versus a publicly held company and a board. However whilst it is clear that Sarah is incredibly successful that doesn't stop her worrying about her family. She and her husband Matthew Broderick, 52, share three young children, James Wilkie, 12, and five-year-old twins Marion and Tabitha. SJP, who at the time of the shoot was about to head to Italy for six weeks to shoot All Roads Lead To Rome, said it was difficult to be away from them whilst filming. 'It’s a really long time to be away from the children and I’m getting a little bit anxious about it,just being gone is the ever-present conflict. 'Someone very clever said to me recently, ‘The only reason you feel guilty is because you enjoy your work’. Perhaps that’s true. I know they’re going to be beyond fine, they’re going to be great, but I worry and I miss them.' The film is a romantic comedy which sees SJP star as uptight Maggie who travels with her former Italian lover Luca - to be played by Raoul Bova - as they chase her rebellious daughter across Italy. Parker's own life however is more stable that Maggie's something which she is eternally grateful for. 'I’m proud of my husband. I very much love watching him work,' she said, 'I am extremely attached to my family and I feel lucky that we have found and created this life together. 'When I think of my husband and children I also think of those that surround us, that we are privileged enough to call friends, they play such an intricate part in our lives. To talk about family for me is a wonderful meaningful group and without Matthew I wouldn’t have found that particular group, so I feel very blessed.

"Stacking supermarket shelves is better than dreaming of stardom via TV’s The X Factor, Iain Duncan Smith insists today as he mounts an extraordinary attack on critics of a flagship work experience scheme for benefit claimants. The Work and Pensions Secretary reveals that thousands of youngsters on the dole have already secured jobs after taking part in a Government programme which offers two-month placements with leading employers — with more than half coming off benefits. Human rights lawyers representing an unemployed graduate who objected to stacking shelves in budget store Poundland have led critics to liken the scheme to ‘slave labour’. Fantasy world: Iain Duncan Smith rallies against the belief that being a celebrity or appearing on the X Factor is the only route worth pursuing in life. Pictures are Little Mix - the winners of the talent show last year . Success: The Work and Pensions Secretary reveals that thousands of youngsters on the dole have already secured jobs after taking part in a Government programme . Mr Duncan Smith argues that some of the country’s most successful businessmen — including former Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy — started their careers on the shop floor. Work, he says, can give people languishing on welfare handouts a sense of purpose and open up opportunities. Mr Duncan Smith argues that an obsession with celebrity risks breaking the link between ‘success and hard work’ — as well as indirectly fuelling mass immigration. ‘It is because of such attitudes that we have seen British businesses bringing in large numbers of foreign nationals to do jobs for which they cannot find people at home,’ he says. According to the latest figures, . 34,200 benefit claimants so far have taken work placements under the . Government-led programme. Firms taking part include Tesco, Boots and . Holland & Barrett. Initial . analysis of 1,300 cases shows that after 13 weeks, only 49 per cent . remained on welfare handouts. Some stop claiming, but thousands are . getting jobs. However, . Labour frontbencher John Woodcock is expected to warn today that while . the scheme appears ‘shambolic’, his party must acknowledge its own . failure on welfare reform and back the ‘something for something’ principle. ‘We must not be . diverted by the inadequacies of one particular scheme into stepping back . from the principle of increasing obligations placed on benefit . claimants as we increase support available to them,’ he is expected to . say. by IAIN DUNCAN SMITH, Work and Pensions Secretary . Over the past few days, the battle lines have been clearly drawn on the issue of youth unemployment. In one corner, we find those prepared to do everything they can to give a chance to young people who are looking for a job and help them gain experience of the workplace. In the other, armed with an unjustified sense of superiority and sporting an intellectual sneer, we find a commentating elite which seems determined to belittle and downgrade any opportunity for young people that doesn’t fit their pre-conceived notion of a ‘worthwhile job’. Talent show Britain: Iain Duncan Smith writes the country is in 'danger of creating a society with a twisted culture that thinks being a celebrity or appearing on The X Factor is the only route worth pursuing in life' Let me start by saying that I am enormously proud of our Work Experience scheme, as well as of the companies who have chosen to take part. Under the scheme, young people on benefits are offered placements of up to two months with a variety of employers to give them an opportunity to get an experience of work. Firms who have signed up include Boots, McDonald’s, Argos, Tesco and Primark. In return for working 30 hours a week, the unemployed continue to receive their normal Jobseeker’s Allowance as well as expenses. The thinking behind the initiative is the recognition that when considering whether to take a young person on, employers will highly value any relevant work experience. It is up to young people to decide, voluntarily, whether they wish to take part in the scheme, and they can pull out of their placement during the first week without sanction. Criticism: Tesco have faced an angry backlash for signing up to the Government scheme - and employing people on benefits for an initial period without pay . This is why the scheme has been so successful. The fact is that 13 weeks after starting their placements, around 50 per cent of those taking part have either taken up permanent posts or have stopped claiming benefits. Take, for example, 20-year-old Samantha Davies, from Neath, South Wales, who took a Work Experience placement at a local nursery. She impressed them so much that she was offered a job, and now she has signed off Jobseeker’s Allowance. Or Chris Burke, from Lewisham, South-East London, who got a job as an administrative apprentice at a local college. What’s more, the scheme is so popular among young people that it is oversubscribed. As a result, we are expanding it later this year through the new Youth Contract to guarantee a place for every unemployed young person who wants one. Given this, you may be surprised to hear some of the criticism that has been directed at the scheme in recent days, including the claim that young people are being forced into ‘21st-century slavery’, or that we are engaging in so-called ‘workfare’. Let me be quite clear: this Government does not have a workfare programme. Workfare is an American term used to describe employment programmes which force all jobseekers to work at a certain point of their welfare claim — a practice which we do not consider to be effective. Here, in Britain, it is true that we have a programme which can require claimants to undertake a short period of compulsory work if we do not believe they are engaging properly in the pursuit of employment. But the programme is carefully targeted and — importantly — it is entirely separate from the voluntary Work Experience scheme which I described above. The fact is that the Government’s opponents — who constitute a group of modern-day Luddites — are throwing around these misleading terms in a deliberately malicious and provocative fashion, and will stop at nothing in their attempts to mislead the public on this issue. What is utterly unacceptable is that many of Britain’s largest and most prestigious employers have found themselves caught up in the middle of this undignified row. The firms who have offered work experience to young people on this scheme have been absolutely brilliant and, most importantly, they are making a difference in terms of helping the young unemployed get into work. Shop floor: Sir Terry Leahy, the former Tesco chief-executive, started out by stacking shelves in 1974 . For example, out of around 1,400 individuals who have taken part in the Work Experience placement at Tesco, more than 300 have been taken on in permanent roles with the supermarket. Most admirably, these firms are offering opportunities and helping the economic prospects of our younger generation. I hope more companies will see the benefits and choose to take part by investing in our young people in the future. However, to help these youngsters, we also have to expose the lies of those who have launched unedifying attacks on our programme. Sadly, so much of this criticism, I fear, is intellectual snobbery. The implicit message behind these ill-considered attacks is that jobs in retail, such as those with supermarkets or on the High Street, are not real jobs that worthwhile people do. How insulting and demeaning of the many thousands of people who already work in such jobs up and down the country! I doubt I’m the only person who thinks supermarket shelf-stackers add more value to our society than many of those ‘job snobs’ who are busy pontificating about the Government’s employment policies. They should learn to value work and not sneer at it. Furthermore, those critics waging war against work experience also forget that some of this country’s most successful businessmen and women started their careers on the shop floor. Lest we forget, Tesco’s former chief executive officer Sir Terry Leahy started life scrubbing floors at a Tesco store in his school holidays. As well as betraying their ignorance and snobbery, our opponents have pathetically opted to use human rights laws, making claims about people being subjected by force to ‘slave labour’. These, though, have no basis in reality, since our work programme is purely voluntary. It’s time to put an end to this damaging nonsense. The hard truth is that finding the right job for someone is not easy. There isn’t always one simple route. Meanwhile, we are caught in a battle between those who think young people should work only if they are able to secure their dream job, and those like myself who passionately believe that work in all shapes and forms can be valuable, for it gives people a sense of purpose and opens up further opportunities. Anyone who is gulled by those who believe in the first path is in danger of creating a society with a twisted culture that thinks being a celebrity or appearing on The X Factor is the only route worth pursuing in life. The belief that you can just sit at home or wait to become a TV star and that work simply lands in your lap, in turn, feeds the pernicious idea that success is not related to effort and work. In light of such attitudes from so many indigenous Britons, it’s small wonder that businesses have hired so many foreign nationals in the past decade or so. The fact is that they can’t find the employees of quality that they need from the available British workforce. Now is the time to provide opportunities for young people, to help get them back and competing in the workplace, and to give them real opportunities for the future. Work experience is part of the fight-back of welfare reform — based on the principle of enlightenment, not entitlement.","Mr Duncan-Smith claims thousands have come off the dole and got jobs after taking up two-month placements with employers .

"Their famous partners could not be more different - one is in training to be a future king, while the other is the first British male to win Wimbledon since the 1930s. But the lives of Kim Sears, 26, and the Duchess of Cambridge, 32, have taken a remarkably similar path since the early Noughties. Yesterday, after nine years together, Kim and Andy Murray, 27, announced their engagement. Scroll down for video . Tennis star Andy Murray has proposed to his girlfriend of nine years Kim Sears (left). The 26-year-old and the Duchess of Cambridge (right) have followed similar path in their adult lives, including long courtships before getting engaged to famous men. Like Kate, Kim has had a style transformation into a fashion icon . The couple have had one of the longest courtships in recent British showbiz history - much like the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, there has been constant speculation about when they would finally get hitched. But that isn't the only similarity between the two women. Kim has also chosen to shun the limelight, provided a rare constant in her boyfriend's ever-changing environment and quietly established herself as a modern style icon for young women. Like William and Kate, Andy and Kim have been together for most of their adult lives. Kate and William met while they were both studying at the University of St Andrews and began their romance in late 2003. Andy Murray and Kim Sears at the SAP Open in San Jose in 2006 . Kim and Andy met in 2005 at the US Open when they were both just 17 years old - Kim was travelling with her father Nigel, who was head of the Women's Tennis Association at the time. The couple were introduced at a party and hit it off, but according to reports, Andy chased the shy school student for several months before she agreed to go out with him. Kim kept such a low profile that the press were completely unaware of their relationship until Andy kissed her on camera during the SAP Open in San Jose in 2006. After winning two matches against Lleyton Hewitt and Andy Roddick at the tournament, Andy celebrated by jumping into the stands and embracing Kim - an exercise that he has completed several times since. Andy was Kim's first serious boyfriend. In fact, the East Sussex-born brunette had kept a low profile at Burgess Hill school, with her nose mainly stuck in books. A fellow pupil said after they left: 'At school she was seen as a bit of a goody-goody who got on with her work and was very reserved. 'She was very clever but she was quite shy and seemed very innocent.' Tennis player Andy Murray and his long time girlfriend Kim Sears arrive at Buckingham Palace in October 2013, where Andy became an Officer of the Order of the British Empire . Like Kate, Kim was a keen sportswoman at school and did very well in her A-Levels, getting straight A's in drama, music and art before going on to study English Literature at the University of Sussex in Brighton. Kate graduated from Marlborough with almost identical grades, she obtained two A's in maths and art,  and a B in English. In the early days of their relationship, Kim worked in a shop in Brighton to support herself during her studies. Her busy schedule meant that she and Andy lived largely independent lives, something that he has since credited with one of the reasons for their romance lasting. In an interview with The Sunday Times, he said: 'She doesn’t come to loads of tournaments as I also find being away from each other is good as well. 'If you spend three months in a row together, by the end of it we’re like, you know, arguing and stuff.' In a separate interview, he also claimed that she had better things to do that follow him around the globe. He said: 'She doesn't want to follow me around on tour. 'She wants to have her own career, not just pose in Hello magazine.' The Duke of Cambridge uttered similar sentiments about his now wife in an interview in 2010 about their brief break-up. He said: 'It was very much trying to find our own way and we were growing up, and so it was just sort of a bit of space and a bit of things like that and it worked out for the better.' Kim Sears has transformed her style since her boho chic fashion between 2006 (right) and 2008 (left) Kim is now known for her polished sense of style . It isn't just both Andy and Kim's strong streaks of independence that has helped with the pressures of Andy's global career, her calm personality has also been credited for keeping the tennis star grounded ahead of important matches. His mother Judy claimed that she is one of the best things that had ever happened to her son and Andy has previously admitted that Kim is one of the few people that he even talks to during high-pressure tournaments. He said: 'I work better in a relationship. 'At the end of a day, especially if I’ve lost a match, I don’t like talking about tennis, so it’s nice to have someone to talk to about other stuff. 'You're in these huge cities meeting new people all the time and it would be easy to get your head turned. 'But Kim has always been there for me. 'She really cares about me and helps with so many things. She always has. That's why we have such a great relationship.' Kim is very close to Andy's family - his mother Judy (left) once claimed that she is one of the best things that had ever happened to her son . Kim with Andy, his father Will and one of the border terriers Maggie . Although they are often apart for large periods of time, their home life is incredibly stable. After just a few years together, the couple moved into a £5 million house in Oxshott, Surrey where they still live with their two border terriers, Rusty and Maggie. Kim is so obsessed with dogs that she has built up a successful art business online, painting portraits of people's pets. She regularly showcases her work on her website KimSears.com. Kate is also a huge fan of dogs - she likes them so much that her brother James gifted the couple with their cocker spaniel Lupo for their wedding present. Apart from art and dogs, her interests include long walks in the English countryside, Classic FM, country music and Jilly Cooper novels. In fact, she is such a fan of the romantic books that her collection started to fall apart from over-reading. She once said: 'To label (Jilly) as ‘summer reading’ does her a complete disservice. 'I would have honestly written my dissertation on her if I was permitted. 'I own two copies of (her book) Polo because on the third time of reading I had to hold the book together with a clothes peg as all the pages were dropping out.' Like the Duchess of Cambridge, a bouncy blow dry has become a hallmark of Kim's style . Kim and Kate both have an enviable wardrobe for official events . While the couple have had a largely stable relationship, like William and Kate, Andy and Kim split briefly a few years after their romance started. In November 2009, the couple announced that they had broken up and Kim had moved out of their mansion and back into her family home. Reports at the time blamed several issues, including Andy's addiction to video games. But the break didn't last long - seven months later they were back together. Prince William and Kate Middleton split in March 2007 but got back together just a few months later at a party in June. Since Kim and Andy's reconciliation, the pressure for the couple to get engaged has been relentless. Much like with Kate, regular press reports questioned how long Kim would wait to get a ring on her finger, despite repeated affirmations from the couple that Kim was focusing on choosing her career path. So frustrated with the questioning, Andy sent a jokey tweet earlier this year in a Q&A with fans on Twitter, saying: 'We're getting married just after Wimbledon, should be a great day,' but he was forced to retract the statement by his PR agency and admit it was said in jest. Andy Murray and Kim Sears arrive at the Burberry Spring/Summer 2013 collection in 2012 . In 2013, he cut down Holly Willoughby during a television interview after the presenter asked when he would be asking for his girlfriend's hand in marriage. She had said: 'I'm trying to think what you're next challenge will be. 'You've had the US Open, the Olympics, now Wimbledon, could it be popping the question?' He replied: 'I only met you like ten minutes ago so I wouldn't be telling you first.' Now that the pair have finally announced official plans to tie the knot, the focus will surely turn to Kim's choice of wedding dress. Since she first arrived on the scene as Andy's girlfriend, her hair and clothes have taken on an increasingly polished appearance, much like the Duchess of Cambridge. Kim and Andy sit front row at Burberry Prorsum 2011 Spring/Summer collection in 2010 alongside Alexa Chung, Douglas Booth, Sarah Jessica Parker and Serena Williams . Kim's fashion choices are now a hot topic at every Wimbledon and in 2013, The Telegraph even claimed that 'Kim Sears reinvents the WAG at Wimbledon.' The pair are now regulars on the front row at London Fashion Week. As well as planning for a wedding, Murray fans could also be looking forward to the arrival of a new tennis prodigy in the next few years, as Andy recently talked about his desire to start a family. He said last year: 'I can see myself having a family one day. 'It is something that I'm starting to think about.'","Kim Sears and the Duchess of Cambridge have followed similar paths .

"She shot to fame as one quarter of girl group Eternal way back in the 1990s and despite turning 40 this year, Louise Redknapp is looking better than ever. Her career, too, is booming. She recently used her fashion expertise to edit a range for TU at Sainsbury's, she and husband Jamie are the faces of Pandora's Christmas campaign and now she's got a beauty campaign under her belt. The mother-of-two's latest venture sees her showcasing her eternally youthful looks as the face of Dr Organic Snail Gel range. Scroll down for video . Still going strong: Louise Redknapp may have been working in the industry for over 20 years but as her new campaign proves, she's looking better than ever . The campaign couldn't be more fitting for the organic beauty fan, who also runs her own all-natural cosmetics range. 'I have a huge interest in organic and natural skincare,' she told MailOnline. 'I looked into the snail gel range and I liked everything about it, it was perfect for me.' The WAG and singer explains: 'Unfortunately, anti-ageing is very important for me at this age. That's why I love this range, it's hydrating and so fresh. I wish I'd thought of it!'. As well as using the range she's promoting, Louise maintains that the only other products she uses are her own from Wild About Beauty - the organic range she established with her make-up artist, Kim Jacob. 'My skincare routine is really simple,' she says. 'I cleanse my face and put moisturiser on, that's it. Less really is more.' Fresh-faced: The campaign couldn't be more fitting for the organic beauty fan, who also runs her own all-natural cosmetics range, Wild About Beauty . The star has such a passion for fashion (she runs her own blog with her pals called A Style Album), that she takes heed of catwalk trends and incorporates them into her make-up palettes. 'Our make-up is fashion-led. I look at trends, analyse textures, create mood boards and plan for the year ahead,' she explains. Her range has even got the royal seal of approval - she sends some of her bestsellers to friend and fellow natural beauty, Princess Beatrice, she revealed. Like Bea, Louise favours a natural look - and says husband Jamie has 'no option' but to deal with it. She does, however, love getting glammed up for work, and her new Pandora campaign is case in point. 'We had such a good day shooting it, it was so much fun,' she said of the campaign. 'Jamie is my best mate as well as my husband so we had such a laugh - we really do entertain each other.' Strong couple: Louise and football pundit Jamie married in 1998 and have two young boys together . The couple, who married back in 1998, are one of showbiz's strongest couples and say they'd love to work together again, as long as it was something they believe in. Twenty years into her career, Louise says she 'feels good getting up and going to work' because she has a 'genuine interest' in what she's doing. As for rumours of her getting back into the studio, she said: 'I haven't been in yet but we have been talking about it. I think it's all about finding the right thing, every decision is so key.' In the meantime, her fashion blog is keeping her busy. 'It came out of the blue but it's going so well and takes up so much of my time,' she said. 'My family scream at me at night because I am sat there on the internet looking at skirts and spending more money,' she laughed. Live together, work together: Jamie and Louise are the stars of the #PandoraWishes campaign and say they had 'such a laugh' working together on the shoot .

"A jazz saxophonist whose daughter was killed in the Sandy Hook massacre has a released a heart-rendering album dedicated to her memory. Ana Marquez-Greene, six, was among the 20 pupils and six adults murdered by Adam Lanza at the Connecticut elementary school in December 2012. While the world knows how Ana died, her father Jimmy Greene wants the public to know how she lived. Scroll down for audio . Jimmy Greene, kissing his wife Nelba Marquez-Greene as he holds a portrait of their daughter, Sandy Hook school shooting victim Ana Marquez-Greene, has released an album in his daughter's memory . Mr Greene (left) wants the public to know how Ana lived, rather than remembering her for the way she died . The album, called Beautiful Life, includes Ana singing hymn Come Thou Almighty King while her brother plays the piano . After Ana's death, her father found a homemade book on her desk titled 'Ana's flower book for Dad'. The booked was filled with pages of flowers drawn in different colors and shapes and inspired Mr Greene to put the record together. The album, called Beautiful Life, features ballads, hymns and three songs Mr Greene composed himself to honour Ana. The new record will include Ana singing the hymn Come Thou Almighty King with her brother playing on the piano. Greene sings about his hope to one day join her in Heaven. Mr Greene told NPR: 'I want the music to reflect the way that Ana lived. 'My daughter, who always loved to be around my son when he was practicing, she would be around the piano and she sung the lyrics to Come Thou Almighty King while he was playing.' Mr Greene wants the album to paint a picture of how his daughter lived, 'lovingly, faithfully and joyfully' Victims: Lanza killed 27 people, most pictured above, including Ana (top left) at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Connecticut . Terror: Pictured above are students at Sandy Hook being led away from the school by teachers during Lanza's murderous rampage . Mr Greene, who is also assistant professor of music and assistant coordinator of jazz studies at Western Connecticut State University, added: 'Sitting in my basement where I have my work area by myself, and writing the songs and writing the lyrics, there was a lot of tears. There was a lot of anguish. 'Much attention has been paid to the way in which my precious Ana died but this album attempts to paint the picture of how she lived – lovingly, faithfully and joyfully.' A children's choir on the record is made up of friends of Ana and her brother from their old home in Canada as well as classmates from Newtown. Many of them were too emotional to sing during the recording sessions, Mr Greene said. The Sandy Hook massacre saw 20 pupils aged six and seven, as well as six teaching staff, killed by Adam Lanza. Lanza murdered his mother before heading to the Newtown school and indiscriminately shooting children. Less than five minutes after entering the school, Lanza turned the gun on himself.","Ana Marquez-Green was among 20 pupils killed in Sandy Hook massacre .

"Millions of Americans are expected to head to the stores for holiday gift shopping on Thanksgiving in what's quickly becoming a new holiday tradition. And it's one that's sparked some backlash among shoppers and employees who believe Thanksgiving should be a time to spend with family. Just a few years ago when a few stores started opened late on the holiday, the move was met with resistance from workers and shoppers who believed the day should be sacred. Last year, more than dozen major retailers opened at some point on Thanksgiving evening. And this year, at least half of them - including Target, Macy's, Staples and J.C. Penney - are opening earlier in the evening on the holiday. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Open early: Macys will be open at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day and employees and shoppers aren't happy . Tough choice: Single mom Lisa Cappiello will need to leave her family early on the holiday to get to Macy's at 6 p.m. and she's not especially looking forward to it but will work because she needs the money . Early bird!: J.C. Penny will be open at 5 p.m. on today so shoppers can snag items for less . Super sale: Staples will open at 6 p.m. today and close at 10 p.m. so shoppers can get their sale fix . Single mom Lisa Cappiello will need to leave her family early on the holiday to get to Macy's at 6 p.m. and she's not especially looking forward to it but will work because she needs the money. 'I would've though 8 o'clock. Never in a million years would I have thought 6 o'clock,'  Cappiello told CBS. 'People choose to go in for Thanksgiving because they're offering you time and a half to come in, and if you need the money, you're going to take it,' Cappiello added. Stores have received widespread backlash for deciding to on the coveted national holiday. CNN reports that there are currently 71 petitions on Change.org that call for retailers and consumers to change their approach to Black Friday. The  'Say No To Shopping on Thanksgiving' Facebook page has nearly 65,000 likes, while 'Boycott Black Thursday' has more than 114,000. The Thanksgiving openings are one way retailers are trying to compete for Americans' holiday dollars. Used to be that the day after Thanksgiving, known as Black Friday, was when they'd focus their sales promotions. But increasingly, they've been pushing those promotions earlier on Friday - and eventually into the holiday itself - to grab deal-hungry shoppers' attention. Bill Martin, co-founder of ShopperTrak, which tracks data at 70,000 stores globally, is expecting a sales increase of 3 percent to 5 percent to $2.57 billion to $2.62 billion on Thanksgiving. Last year's figure grew two-fold from the year before. Wont open doors: A bevy of stores have refused to open on the coveted national holiday Thanksgiving . Refusing to open: Costco will not be open on Thanksgiving day so employees can be with family . Employees at home: Those who wish to buy household items will need to wait until Black Friday since employees will be celebrating with friends and family on the holiday . Play day: Game Stop employees have the day off on Thanksgiving since the store will be closed . The National Retail Federation expects 25.6 million shoppers to take advantage of the Thanksgiving openings, down slightly down from last year. Kathy Grannis, a spokeswoman at the retail trade group, said that earlier promotions in the month and shoppers' uncertainty about when they can get the best deals are factors that could lead to fewer shoppers coming out on the holiday. Nevertheless, Thanksgiving is starting to take a bite out of Black Friday business. Indeed, sales dropped 13.2 percent to $9.74 billion on Black Friday last year. Analysts said Thanksgiving sales were in part responsible for the decline. And Gerald Storch, who runs a retail consultancy called Storch Advisors, said stores that open on Thanksgiving get more of their share for the weekend than others who open on Friday. 'That's why they keep doing it,' he said. 'You have to be first.' Being first lures shoppers like Fred Peek of Atlanta. He plans to shop on Thanksgiving at Best Buy or Wal-Mart for a camera. Peek said that with more stores opening for a longer period of time on Thanksgiving, he believes shopping will be less hectic that last year. ""It won't be such a rush trying to get to where I need to get to,"" he said. Not every store is opening on Thanksgiving, though. Some, including GameStop, Costco and Ikea, have said they won't open because they want their workers to enjoy the holiday with their families. 'At GameStop, we often use the phrase ""protect the family"" in reference to our business,' the video game retailer said in a company statement. And not every shopper is happy about stores opening on the holiday. A number of petitions have been circulating on change.org targeting Wal-Mart, Target and other retailers for opening their stores on Thanksgiving, or starting their sales that day. Most of Wal-Mart's stores already open around the clock. On Change.org a petition to close stores on Thanksgiving got .","Target, Macy's, Staples and J.C.

"Barcelona utility man Javier Mascherano has leapt to the defence of team-mate Lionel Messi, believing criticism of the superstar forward has been excessive.

"Andy Murray’s hometown today sent their congratulations to their local hero after he announced his engagement to long-term love Kim Sears. Children made colourful cards congratulating the tennis ace on his love game, while the local butchers created a message in sausage. And Murray’s beaming gran joked: 'It’s about time'. Shirley Erskine, 83, said she was delighted to reveal her good news after being initially sworn to secrecy. Celebrations commence: Dunblane business's and residents congratulated their local hero Andy Murray today on his engagement to Kim Sears. Andy's granny Shirley Erskine is pictured here with congratulation cards  made by kids at the Dunblane Centre. Speaking at her Dunblane home, she said: 'We’re delighted. Kim is a lovely girl. Andy phoned and said ""just to tell you, I proposed to Kim today"". His grandpa Roy and I were thrilled. 'Roy told him ""I hope she said yes"". I asked, ""can I give my congratulations to Kim"", and he said ""she’s right here"". 'He passed the phone to Kim. She was very excited - we all were. I’m told it’s a lovely ring. Kim has been such a great support to Andy through all his highs and lows. 'We couldn’t be happier for them both.' Mrs Erskine agreed to deliver to her grandson handmade cards created by local children at the Dunblane Centre, adding: 'They’re brilliant. He’ll love them.' Marco McCool, 10, whose card read 'Andy + Kim 4 ever', said: 'Andy’s an amazing tennis player – and now he’s a very lucky guy.' Katie Wales, aged eight, added: 'I want to say well done – Kim’s lovely.' Thrilled: Speaking at her Dunblane home, Shirley said: 'We're delighted. Kim is a lovely girl. His grandpa Roy and I were thrilled' Gemma Greer, centre manager, said: 'Everyone is really excited. We watch all Andy’s games and have gone through all his ups and downs. 'Everyone’s hoping they will be married at Andy’s hotel, Cromlix House. It would be lovely if Dunblane was able to give them a good send off for married life. 'It will be the event of the year.' One person posted a congratulations message, complete with love hearts, on the City of Dunblane sign welcoming visitors to Murray’s home. Another attached a pink heart to the golden post box in Dunblane High Street, painted in celebration of Murray’s gold medal at the London Olympics .

Supportive: Roy Erskine and Shirley Erskine, grandparents of Andy Murray, watch his match on Centre Court against Croatia's Ivo Karlovic on day four of the 2012 Wimbledon Championships . Passing on the news: Mrs Erskine agreed to deliver to her grandson handmade cards created by local children at the Dunblane Centre . Even the Dunblane butcher was celebrating – with a congratulatory message reading 'Andy and Kim', with a love-heart all made out of sausage. Butcher Connor Wilson, 22, of Bennett’s of Dunblane, said: 'It’s our way of saying congratulations and all the best. 'Hopefully the wedding will be in Dunblane and we can treat Andy and Kim to a nice big steak.' Andy’s old school pal, Stewart McClymont, 27, said: 'When we were kids all we talked about was football and wrestling, but we’ve all grown up and I couldn’t be more pleased for him. 'Kim’s a lovely girl. She’s down to earth, easy going and obviously exactly what Andy needs. They seem perfectly suited.' Pub landlord Alan Duncan, 48, who has shown all of Andy’s big matches at the Dunblane Hotel in recent years, said: 'We all wish Andy and Kim many more happy years together. It’s not been his best year on the court but he’s still managed to end the season on a high note.' Andy proposed to Kim Sears, 26, last week with a diamond ring he chose himself and she immediately said ‘yes’. Look of love: Left, a candid moment between the pair, and right, after winning Olympic gold in 2012 . Sources said the couple had hoped to keep their engagement secret for some time and have not yet made plans for their wedding. Murray, 27, who flew to the Philippines for a tennis tournament yesterday, had not even shared his happy news with some of his closest family members. The sportsman’s mother Judy said last night that she was ‘thrilled’, but his grandmother said she had heard only ‘rumours’. Since last year becoming the first British man to win the Wimbledon singles title since 1936, Murray has repeatedly batted off questions about when he would ask Miss Sears to marry him. But he popped the question last Wednesday, placing a painstakingly selected engagement ring on her finger. Miss Sears was just 17 and still studying her A-Levels when she met the up-and-coming tennis player at the US Open in 2005. Murray wooed her with phone calls and flowers. But she did not allow their burgeoning romance to affect her schoolwork, and she achieved straight As in her exams. The couple managed to keep their relationship quiet – until Murray won his first tournament in California in 2006 and ran through the crowd to give his girlfriend a kiss. They separated briefly in 2009, reportedly because of the sports star’s video games obsession, but rekindled their romance after six months and have stayed together since. She has been credited with improving the tennis player’s scruffy appearance and helping him to control his fiery temper on court.

Murray, who grew up in Dunblane in Scotland, has spoken of the strength he draws from Miss Sears, particularly in the light of his own parents’ separation when he was just 11. ‘I work better in a relationship. At the end of a day, especially if I’ve lost a match, I don’t like talking about tennis, so it’s nice to have someone to talk to about other stuff,’ he said in 2009. The couple live in a £5.6million house in Oxshott, Surrey, with their two Border terriers, Rusty and Maggie May. There had been a series of rumours that Murray was about to propose to Miss Sears before their engagement was officially confirmed yesterday. In January he jokingly tweeted: ‘We are getting married just after Wimbledon, should be a great day.’ The message prompted Twitter users to offer their congratulations, until he admitted that it was just ‘tongue-in-cheek’. Murray has already spoken of how he would like to have children with Miss Sears. Domesticity: The pair pop out to do some shopping in 2010 .

It would be nice, without a doubt.’ A spokesman for Murray confirmed that the star had become engaged but declined to give any further details.

"Kim Jong-Un's younger sister has become a senior party official, confirming her rise through the ranks as a potential key aide to the North Korean leader. Kim Yo-Jong, believed to be 26, made her first public appearance during the funeral of her father and longtime ruler Kim Jong-Il in December 2011. Since then, she has occasionally been seen accompanying her brother to political events and on his 'field guidance trips', but without any specific title attached to her name. That changed today when the North's official KCNA news agency listed her as a 'vice department director' in the powerful central committee of the ruling Workers' Party. Scroll down for video . Kim Jong-Un's younger sister, Kim Yo-Jong (believed to be pictured, left) has become a senior party official, confirming her rise through the ranks as a potential key aide to the North Korean leader . Kim Jong Un, who is regularly the centrepiece of state propaganda, recently disappeared from state media reports for over a month, prompting speculation about alternative structures of power within the ruling Kim family. Kim Yo-Jong was accompanying her brother on a trip to a cartoon film studio founded by their grandfather and the North's founding president, Kim Il-Sung. During the visit, Kim Jong-Un urged animators to produce works that are 'true to the intention of the party'. It is not clear exactly what Kim Yo-Jong's responsibilities are, but analysts suggested she was either in the powerful organisational department handling personnel changes or a propaganda unit. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un gives 'field guidance' to the Sinchon Museum in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang on November 25 . Family values: North Korean watchers have speculated that Kim Yo-Jong is being groomed to playing the same leadership supporting role as her powerful aunt, Kim Kyong-Hui . 'There aren't a whole lot of officials at her level that get publicly mentioned in KCNA articles,' noted Yang Moo-Jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul. North Korean watchers have speculated that Kim Yo-Jong is being groomed to playing the same leadership supporting role as her powerful aunt, Kim Kyong-Hui. Kim Kyong-Hui, 68, was a close aide to her own brother and late leader Kim Jong-Il for decades, assuming senior positions in the party and becoming a four-star general in 2010. But she largely disappeared from public view after her husband Jang Song-Thaek was executed last December for charges including treason. Dictatorship: The Kim family has ruled the reclusive, impoverished state for more than six decades with an iron fist and a pervasive personality cult . A UN resolution earlier this month condemned the North's human rights record and recommended that its leadership be referred to the International Criminal Court on possible charges of crimes against humanity . She and Jang had been seen as the ultimate Pyongyang power couple, and instrumental in smoothing Kim Jong-Un's transition to power, before Jang fell from grace. Yang Moo-Jin said it was still too early to say whether Kim Yo-Jong would be able to acquire the same level of power and influence as her aunt. 'It's hard to gauge where she stands overall. Is she influential enough to communicate with top party officials? Or is she simply working at propaganda operations?' Yang said. 'It's hard to tell, especially with someone so young. So I think it's premature to say what role she is, or will be, playing,' he added. The Kim family has ruled the reclusive, impoverished state for more than six decades with an iron fist and a pervasive personality cult. Kim Jong-Un inspects a combined joint military drill of the units under the North Korean People's Army . A resolution adopted at the UN earlier this month condemned the North's human rights record and recommended that its leadership be referred to the International Criminal Court on possible charges of crimes against humanity. Pyongyang has rejected the resolution as politically motivated, and a series of mass rallies denouncing its adoption have been held in cities across North Korea in recent days. Images published by the ruling party's official newspaper Rodong Sinmun on Thursday showed thousands marching with banners reading: 'Let's become guns and bombs that protect the respected comrade Kim Jong-Un!' The largest rally was held in Pyongyang on Tuesday, with hundreds of thousands of troops and civilians packing the capital's Kim Il-Sung Square.","Kim Yo-Jong unveiled as 'vice department director' in powerful committee .

"Former secretary of state and potential 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton made it very clear during an appearance earlier this week that she is no fan of Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who leaked thousands of classified documents to journalists and who currently is avoiding criminal charges by hiding out in Russia. The former first lady attended a discussion at the University of Connecticut on Wednesday and was asked whether Snowden's leaks had done anything to help national security, or the discourse about how far the government can go in terms of domestic intelligence gathering. Clinton said she feels that the balance between privacy and security is important, but the way Snowden went about bringing the information to light was damaging to national security and may have inadvertently helped terrorist groups. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Harm: Clinton says Snowden's leaks did nothing but harm U.S. security and help terrorists and those who with harm on America . 2016: Clinton is a potential Democratic presidential candidate in 2016 . 'I think turning over a lot of that material—intentionally or . unintentionally, because of the way it can be drained—gave all kinds of . information, not only to big countries, but to networks and terrorist . groups and the like,' she said. She went on to say that she doesn't 'understand why he couldn't have been part of the debate at home,' before taking classified documents to other countries. Clinton went to explain how Snowden could have had a bigger impact if he had turned the information over to officials and asked for whistleblower protection. 'When he emerged and when he absconded with all that material, I was . puzzled, because we have all these protections for whistleblowers,' Clinton said. 'If he were . concerned and wanted to be part of the American debate, he could have . been. But it struck me as—I just have to be honest with you—as sort of . odd that he would flee to China, because Hong Kong is controlled by . China, and that he would then go to Russia, two countries with which we . have very difficult cyber-relationships, to put it mildly.' Phony: Clinton mocked Snowden's question for Putin about whether Russia has any spy programs similar to ones he exposed in the US . Clinton, a former senator from New York before being appointed secretary of state, explained to the audience that having worked in the State Department and the Senate, she is much better informed about the threats that face the United States than the average citizen - many of whom look at Snowden as a hero. 'There are people right this minute trying to figure out how to do harm to Americans and to other innocent people,' Clinton said before explaining that the balance between security and privacy may have shifted towards security in the post-9/11 world, but that the NSA's intelligence gathering is what's helping to prevent another terrorist attack. After he had stolen the classified documents, Snowden went to Hong Kong, which is ruled by China, before settling in Russia. Clinton said by doing so, Snowden has essentially helped these countries - both of which have somewhat strained relations with United States - gather intelligence about U.S. security forces. 'When I would go to China or I would go to Russia,' she said, 'we would . leave all my electronic equipment on the plane with the batteries out, . because this is a new frontier and they're trying to find out not just . about what we do in our government, they're trying to find out about . what a lot of companies do and they were going after the personal emails . of people who worked in the State Department. It's not like the only . government in the world that is doing anything is the United States.' 'I have a hard time thinking that somebody who is a champion of privacy and liberty has taken refuge in Russia under Putin's authority,' Clinton said of Snowden . Clinton also mocked Snowden's recent call-in to a supposed Q&A with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who granted Snowden temporary asylum in his country after he leaked the classified documents. During the Q&A Snowden cautiously asked the Russian president if the Russian government had spy programs similar to those of the United States. Mocking Snowden and Putin's response, Clinton condescendingly paraphrased Putin's answer, saying, 'well from one intelligence professional to another, of course not.' 'Oh, thank you so much,' she continued to mock. 'I mean really.' Clinton also took a shot at Snowden's claim that he's a passionate defender of privacy and liberty. 'I have a hard time thinking that somebody who is a champion of privacy and liberty has taken refuge in Russia under Putin's authority,' She said. Putin's government has routinely jailed those who oppose his rule, including members of the punk band Pussy Riot and longtime political opponent Mikhail Khodorkovsky, whom Putin had jailed for eight years.","Clinton says Snowden's leaks did nothing to help national security .

"The days of awkwardly trying to wing your way in a foreign language could soon be over. Microsoft has unveiled their new Skype Translator technology that they say can decode languages in real-time. It means that during video calls the speech recognition software will allow two callers from different countries to talk with ease. Scroll down for video . Microsoft has revealed their language translation software for Skype (pictured). Known as Skype Translator, it will enable people with two different dialects to communicate using voice or video calling, with the software then translating what they say into text and voice so that the other person can understand . Microsoft first unveiled the technology two years ago. At the time, though, it was deemed too inaccurate to release to the general public. But a recent breakthrough by the Skype and Microsoft Translator teams in neural network-based speech recognition has reduced errors in speech recognition by more than 30 per cent. In a blog post Microsoft says Skype has more than 300 million users, while at least 2 billion minutes of conversation are spoken every day. Skype can be used across a variety of devices including computers, smartphones, tablets and TVs. It allows users to either voice-call or video-call friends and family anywhere in the world without the large costs of regular phone tariffs. Microsoft says Skype has more than 300 million users around the world, who in turn speak 2 billion minutes of conversation every day. Skype is available for a number of devices including computers, tablets (Windows tablet shown) and smartphones and lets people make calls over the internet . Now Skype Translator could allow people who normally wouldn't be able to understand one another to communicate. Skype Translator is a spin-off of the technology behind Microsoft's Siri clone called Cortana, the personal voice assistant on Windows Phones. In a demo, Microsofts show a conversation with real-time audio translation between and English and German speakers using Skype Translator. The foreign language is converted into subtitles for the other person, and then spoken aloud by a chosen voice. The quick translations allow for a back and forth conversation even though the two don't speak the same language. Microsoft, however, say it is still early days for the technology ‘but the Star Trek vision for the universal translator’ isn’t a galaxy away.’ By the end of 2014 Skype Translator will be available as a Windows 8.1 beta app, although no news on when a full release will be brought to other platforms has yet been announced.","Microsoft has unveiled its new speech recognition software for Skype .

"A financier's wife has been awarded £337 million in what could be Britain’s biggest ever divorce settlement – but her legal team have hinted that she may appeal for more. Sir Chris Hohn has been told to hand over the sum following the collapse of his 15-year marriage to Jamie Cooper-Hohn. The pair – who have homes in London, the US and West Indies – had fought over assets totalling more than £700 million at the High Court. Payout: Jamie Cooper-Hohn (left) , the American wife of financier Sir Chris Hohn (right) has been awarded £337 million by a High Court judge following their divorce battle . The settlement was revealed in a hearing yesterday – during which Mrs Cooper-Hohn’s lawyers asked the judge how long they have to request an appeal. Sources close to Mrs Cooper-Hohn indicated that she wants to examine the precise percentage she has been awarded. Sir Chris’s representatives told the court they were anxious to ‘move on with things [but the] wife is not’. The long-running case had bordered on farce at times, with Sir Chris, 47, accusing Mrs Cooper-Hohn of seeking maintenance payments towards a dog that never existed. What Jamie Cooper-Hohn could afford to buy with her £337 million divorce settlement . Sir Chris, who was born in Addlestone, Surrey, met his American wife, 49, when the pair studied at Harvard Business School. She told an earlier hearing that she initially spurned his advances, but the pair later bonded over the film Malcolm X. They married in Washington DC in 1995 and had four children – triplets, now aged 12, and an older child of 15. They split up in December 2012, with Mrs Cooper-Hohn divorcing Sir Chris in April 2013 – but the decree nisi has never been made absolute. Cahrity work: During the trial, Mrs Cooper-Hohn  told the judge that she worked long hours on behalf of their charitable foundation and travelled . The court heard earlier this year that the couple lived ‘modest’ lives, with Sir Chris’s lifestyle described as more ‘Swatch’ watch than ‘jet-set’. Mrs Cooper-Hohn said she should get half of the couple’s fortune because the wealth was created as a result of their ‘partnership’. Sir Chris said she should receive a quarter. Mrs Cooper-Hohn claimed their joint assets were around £849 million – and added that her ex-husband was worth at least £872 million from personal assets and his hedge fund, for a combined total of £1.72billion. However, Sir Chris, who was knighted in the Queen’s birthday honours this year, claimed he is worth a mere £67 million. Investor: During the trial, Sir Chris had described himself as one of the 'top ten' career investors . One of the country’s biggest philanthropists, Sir Chris has given more than £1 billion to charity through the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, which is linked to his hedge fund. Mrs Cooper-Hohn told the court she had been the chairman of the venture, and was the inspiration behind her husband’s donations. She said: ‘When Chris and I first met, I asked him what he wanted to do. He said “I don’t mind as long as I make a lot of money”.’ Sir Chris – a so-called ‘non-dom’ who is legally based outside of the UK – countered that he had wanted to help others from an early age. He added: ‘I learned very early on that you can’t take money with you and that it doesn’t bring happiness. The basis for my claim [to retain 75 per cent of the disputed fortune] is that I have created all the wealth through expertise, effort and sweat and blood.’ Mrs Justice Roberts has yet to deliver a detailed ruling on the dispute, but a draft version has been given to Sir Chris and Mrs Cooper-Hohn and their legal teams. The £337 million award is thought to be the biggest of its kind ever made by a judge in England. The amount spent on litigation is believed to have run into the millions, too – but it remains unclear who will foot the bill. A judge involved in one of the couple’s earlier hearings had wondered aloud about the fees. ‘God knows the cost of being here,’ Mr Justice Holman had said. ‘I know these people are immensely wealthy ... the costs just roll off the back of the duck like a drop.’ Alison Hawes, a family law specialist at the firm Irwin Mitchell, said yesterday’s settlement was ‘certainly one of the highest’. However, bigger payouts may have been awarded in private hearings. The wife of late Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky reportedly accepted a deal between £165million and £220million three years ago. Boris Berezovsky (pictured) reportedly gave his former wife Galina Besharova  between £165 million and £220 million in a settlement . A number of big money divorce cases resulting in huge payouts has given London the reputation of being 'the divorce capital of the world'. It is widely believed that it capital's judges offer larger settlements for wives, with proceedings taking place relatively quickly. Generous settlements include that awarded to Heather Mills following the break down of her marriage to Sir Paul McCartney 2008. Following the four-year marriage, Miss Mills received £24.3million. That same year Phil Collins's ex-wife Orianne Cevey was awarded a £25million settlement. Bernie Ecclestone reportedly paid ex-wife Slavica £750m in a private settlement. In 2006 Beverley Charman, the former wife of insurance magnate John Charman was awarded a £48million settlement by the English courts in proceedings which took two years. Mr Charman appealed the decision but the pay out, which made legal history at the time, was upheld in 2007. The businessman claimed he was penniless and could not afford to pay his ex-wife anything, prompting a bitter dispute after she alleged he was worth millions. The late Russian oligarch, Boris Berezovsky, featured in a multi-million pound case three years ago - when it was reported that his former wife Galina Besharova had agreed to accept between £165 million and £220 million as part of a settlement. Last November Michelle Young was awarded a £20million sum after parting ways with her 'bankrupt' husband Scot Young.","Sir Chris and estranged wife Jamie had battled over £700m fortune .

"Serious errors in the handling of the Michael Brown shooting have been exposed by the grand jury files on the case, including Darren Wilson's gun not being tested for fingerprints – and the officer washing blood off his hands. A 12-person jury, after hearing more than 70 hours of testimony from 60 witnesses, ruled that Officer Wilson will not have to stand trial over the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. However, in the thousands of pages of evidence released to the public afterwards were glaring examples of crime scene protocol not being followed. A 12-person jury, after hearing more than 70 hours of testimony from 60 witnesses, ruled that Officer Wilson will not have to stand trial over the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown . One of Officer Wilson's key lines of defence was that Michael Brown made him fear he was going to be shot because he tried to grab his gun while in his car. But Wilson placed the gun in an evidence bag himself and the weapon was not tested for fingerprints because, an investigator argued, 'he never lost control of his gun', Huffington Post reported. Wilson was also allowed to drive himself away from the crime scene and wash blood off his hands, actions that are extremely unorthodox according to experts and government rules. David Klinger, an expert on police shootings with the University of Missouri at St Louis, told The Washington Post: 'An officer driving himself back? Wrong. An officer booking his own gun into evidence? Wrong. The appropriate investigative procedures were not followed.' And a 2013 Justice Department manual on processing crime scenes makes the procedure for dealing with blood extremely clear: 'Do not allow suspect to use bathroom facilities, or to alter his/her appearance, including brushing hair or washing hands.' There were numerous other possible breaches in protocol that the jury hearing highlighted. The first officer to interview Wilson after the shooting didn't record the conversation or take notes as he had 'multiple things going through my head besides what Darren was telling me'. The jury also heard how a medical legal examiner who analysed the crime scene didn't take any measurements because 'somebody shot somebody', which was 'self-explanatory'. These issues might all have been used by prosecutors against Wilson had the case gone to trial. Darren Wilson (pictured) placed the gun he shot Michael Brown with in an evidence bag himself and the weapon was not tested for fingerprints . The grand jury papers also underscored inconsistencies in witness statements. Some witnesses said Michael Brown had been shot in the back. Another said he was face-down on the ground when Officer Darren Wilson 'finished him off.' Still others acknowledged changing their stories to fit published details about the autopsy or admitted that they did not see the shooting at all. An Associated Press review of thousands of pages of grand jury documents reveals numerous examples of statements made during the shooting investigation that were inconsistent, fabricated or provably wrong. For one, the autopsies ultimately showed Brown was not struck by any bullets in his back. Prosecutors exposed these inconsistencies before the jurors, which likely influenced their decision not to indict Wilson in Brown's death. Darren Wilson was also allowed to drive himself away from the crime scene . Bob McCulloch, the St. Louis County prosecutor, said the grand jury had to weigh testimony that conflicted with physical evidence and conflicting statements by witnesses as it decided whether Wilson should face charges. 'Many witnesses to the shooting of Michael Brown made statements inconsistent with other statements they made and also conflicting with the physical evidence. Some were completely refuted by the physical evidence,' McCulloch said. The decision Monday not to charge Wilson with any crime set off more violent protests in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson and around the country, fueled by claims that the unarmed black 18-year-old was shot while surrendering to the white officer in the mostly African-American city. What people thought were facts about the August 9 shooting have become intertwined with what many see as abuses of power and racial inequality in America. An Associated Press review of thousands of pages of grand jury documents reveals numerous examples of statements made during the shooting investigation that were inconsistent. Pictured is the inside of Officer Wilson's car following the shooting . And media coverage of the shooting's aftermath made it into the grand jury proceedings. Before some witnesses testified, prosecutors showed jurors clips of the same people making statements on TV. Their inconsistencies began almost immediately after the shooting, from people in the neighborhood, the friend walking with Brown during the encounter and even one woman who authorities suggested probably wasn't even at the scene at the time. Jurors also were presented with dueling versions from Wilson and Dorian Johnson, who was walking with Brown during the August 9 confrontation. Johnson painted Wilson as provoking the violence, while Wilson said Brown was the aggressor. The decision  not to charge Darren Wilson with any crime set off more violent protests in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson . But Johnson also declared on TV, in a clip played for the grand jury, that Wilson fired at least one shot at his friend while Brown was running away: 'It struck my friend in the back.' Johnson held to a variation of this description in his grand jury testimony, saying the shot caused Brown's body to 'do like a jerking movement, not to where it looked like he got hit in his back, but I knew, it maybe could have grazed him, but he definitely made a jerking movement.' Other eyewitness accounts also were clearly wrong. One woman, who said she was smoking a cigarette with a friend nearby, claimed she saw a second police officer in the passenger seat of Wilson's vehicle. When quizzed by a prosecutor, she elaborated: The officer was white, 'middle age or young' and in uniform. She said she was positive there was a second officer - even though there was not. Another woman testified that she saw Brown leaning through the officer's window 'from his navel up,' with his hand moving up and down, as if he were punching the officer. But when the same witness returned to testify again on another day, she said she suffers from mental disorder, has racist views and that she has trouble distinguishing the truth from things she had read online. Prosecutors suggested the woman had fabricated the entire incident and was not even at the scene the day of the shooting. Another witness had told the FBI that Wilson shot Brown in the back and then 'stood over him and finished him off.' But in his grand jury testimony, this witness acknowledged that he had not seen that part of the shooting, and that what he told the FBI was 'based on me being where I'm from, and that can be the only assumption that I have.' The witness, who lives in the predominantly black neighborhood where Brown was killed, also acknowledged that he changed his story to fit details of the autopsy that he had learned about on TV. 'So it was after you learned that the things you said you saw couldn't have happened that way, then you changed your story about what you seen?' a prosecutor asserted. 'Yeah, to coincide with what really happened,' the witness replied. Another man, describing himself as a friend of Brown's, told a federal investigator that he heard the first gunshot, looked out his window and saw an officer with a gun drawn and Brown 'on his knees with his hands in the air.' He added: 'I seen him shoot him in the head.' But when later pressed by the investigator, the friend said he had not seen the actual shooting because he was walking down the stairs at the time and instead had heard details from someone in the apartment complex. 'What you are saying you saw isn't forensically possible based on the evidence,' the investigator told the friend. Shortly after that, the friend asked if he could leave. 'I ain't feeling comfortable,' he said.","A jury ruled Darren Wilson will not stand trial over  Michael Brown shooting .

"Branson, aged five, died a few hours after being bitten by a venomous spider . A five-year-old boy has died, hours after being bitten by a poisonous spider. Branson Riley Carlisle, from Albertsville in Alabama, died in a hospital a few hours after he was bitten by the brown recluse spider on Sunday, reported TV Station WHNT. Branson's pastor, Jeff Stanford, told the station his family is devastated by the sudden and tragic death. Mr Stanford added the family hires an exterminator to come to the house once a month but the spider - which has a venomous bite - came inside the home due to the recent bout of cold weather. His funeral was held yesterday at Memory Hill Cemetery . Claudette DeMuth, director of marketing at Marshall Medical Center, said Branson's family brought the spider to the hospital where it was inspected and identified. 'It had the classic markings' of a brown recluse, she told AL.com. 'He was a very sick young man. 'It is a rare, rare situation for someone to die of a spider bite in our country.' Last month, a 10-year-old Montana boy died two weeks after being bitten on the leg by the same type of spider . Keith Pierce was taken to hospital on September 30 after his leg started swelling up. Also known as the fiddleback spider, the brown recluse spider has a venomous and potentially fatal bite . After ruling out cancer, doctors sent him home, but he taken back to hospital when his pain and symptoms worsened. He underwent emergency surgery, but never woke up. Also last month, a Missouri family was forced out of their home after 6,000 brown recluse spiders moved in. Fumigators had to pump poisonous gas into the house in the upscale neighborhood of Weldon Spring in an attempt to kill the venomous spiders, which had been there for at least seven years. The brown recluse spider is known as the most deadly spider in America and has spread across the country from Nebraska through Iowa, Illinois and Indiana to Ohio. The population has been growing rapidly in recent years and the boom is being blamed on climate change by experts. Also known as the fiddleback spider, the violin spider or  the brown fiddler, the brown recluse spider has venomous and potentially fatal bite. They are usually brown or gray in colour and between six to 20 millimeters in length. They typically have markings on the dorsal side of their cephalothorax, . These markings include a black line coming from the dorsel side that looks like a violin, resulting in the nickname 'fiddleback'. The spiders often build their webs in dry, generally undisturbed locations, including sheds, closets, garages, cellars and other similar places. In America, their range lies roughly south of a line from southeastern Nebraska through to southern Iowa, Illinois and Indiana, to southwestern Ohio. In the southern states, they are native from central Texas to western Georgia and north to Kentucky. Brown recluse spiders have the ability to survive starvation and thirst, and the way in which they benefit from the regulated room temperatures of human habitations, make extermination of this species particularly challenging.","Branson Riley Carlisle died in hospital after he received venomous bite .

"The older of the two Chechen brothers suspected of bombing the Boston Marathon was wounded but alive following a police gun battle when his younger brother ran him over with a car, possibly causing his death. Offering the first detailed account of the firefight, Police Chief Edward Deveau, of Watertown, Massachusetts, where the drama had unfolded early Friday morning, has revealed that 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev walked towards officers firing a gun before he ran out of ammunition and was tackled to the ground. 'He all of a sudden comes out from under cover and just starts walking down the street, shooting at our police officers, trying to get closer,' Deveau said.

Officers who were restraining Tamerlan Tsarnaev got out of the way of the speeding vehicle, which ended up driving over the wounded suspect, the police chief told CNN. According to Deveau, the 19-year-old suspect dragged his sibling’s body a short distance down the street and drove off. He later ditched the SUV and escaped on foot. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was pronounced dead at a hospital a short time later. An alleged autopsy photograph of Tamerlan that was leaked Friday shows multiple gunshot wounds and a massive open gash that spans from the center of his chest to his back. Another smaller gash is located right below the larger wound. His right shoulder and his face show signs of hemorrhaging.

The results of the autopsy have not been released yet, but the preliminary description of the injuries suggests that some of the wounds may have been caused by the vehicle operated by the suspect's brother. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was captured Friday evening following a tense standoff after he was spotted hiding in a boat parked in a backyard, bleeding profusely. Violence erupted in the early morning hours Friday when police received reports of a robbery of a convenience store in Kendall Square near MIT and a police officer was shot and ended up with a gun fight in a small suburban street as residents slept. Sean Collier, an MIT police officer, was shot multiple times while in his cruiser at Main and Vassar streets, near the Stata Center on the MIT campus. The 26-year-old officer was pronounced dead at Massachusetts General Hospital. A short time later, the two men carjacked a Mercedes SUV at gunpoint. Explosive: Police say the suspects opened fire on officers and lobbed makeshift bombs devices at them . Fire power: About 200 rounds were fired during the shootout in a matter of five-ten minutes . Chaos in the streets: Gunfire erupted in a quiet suburban neighborhood, setting off a massive manhunt . The hostage was then driven around for half an hour as the pair decided what their next move would be. As police moved in on the vehicle following reports of a carjacking, the pair decided to dump the driver at a gas station on Memorial Drive in Cambridge. The search for the vehicle led to a chase that ended in Watertown, where authorities said the suspects threw explosive devices from the car and exchanged gunfire with police. Hero: MIT Police Officer Sean Collier was shot and killed in an armed confrontation with the suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing . Richard H. Donahue, 33,  a transit police officer was seriously injured during the chase. In Watertown, witnesses reported hearing multiple gunshots and explosions at about 1am Friday. Dozens of police officers and FBI agents were in the neighborhood and a helicopter circled overhead. Speaking to CNN following Dzhokhar's capture, Deveau said that a single officer was the first to encounter the two cars that Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev were driving, just before 1am Friday. One of the vehicles was a Mercedes SUV the brothers had carjacked earlier that night.Before the officer could call for backup, the two cars came to a stop and the brothers got out. 'They jump out of the car and unload on our police officer,' Deveau said 'They both came out shooting -- shooting guns, handguns. He's under direct fire, very close by. He has to jam it in reverse and try to get himself a little distance.' Five others officers arrived on the scene in the middle of an intense shootout during which Deveau says over 200 rounds were fired in 5-10 minutes. The chief said that one of the suspected bombers lobbed an explosive at the officers, which later turned out to be a pressure cooker bomb like the ones used in the marathon attack Monday. The brothers also allegedly threw . other explosives at police, which Deveau described as 'very rough . devices.' Two of the bombs detonated and two did not. A sixth explosive . was later discovered in one of the vehicles. At . one point, the older brother came directly toward police, firing a gun . at officers as he inched closer toward him, but Tamerlan Tsarnaev's luck . ran out along with his ammunition, allowing one of the officers to . tackle him. Moments later, his younger brother ran him over while fleeing the scene in a black Mercedes.  Accord. Dr. David Schoenfeld, of the Beth . Israel Deaconess Medical Center, was the one who ended up treating the . fatally injured Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Hiding place: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was eventually discovered wonded inside a boat parked in a backyard in Watertown, Mass. 'There was some discussion of who's coming in,' Schoenfeld said of the patient. 'Is it the suspect? Is this a victim? Is it a police officer? 'Ultimately that discussion died down quickly, because it doesn't matter who's coming in,' he added. 'We're going to treat them as best as we can, because you really don't know who it is until the dust settles.' When the 26-year-old was brought in accompanied by a large police escort, he immediately went into cardiac arrest. CPR was performed until a team of doctors could attempt to revive him, inserting chest tubes to treat potential injuries and gain vascular access to give the patient what Schoenfeld described as 'massive blood transfusions.' Tsarnaev succumbed to his injuries at 1.35am. His body was turned over to law enforcement for examination to determine the source of his injuries.","Watertown Police Chief Deveau said Tamerlan Tsranaev, 26, marched towards police officers while shooting at them .

"Madonna posed for a photograph with Malawian hip hop star Tay Grin at a party to celebrate the singer's first visit to the African country for 18 months. The Material Girl met the rapper, real name Limbani Kalilani, in Lilongwe. Grin was invited to the party by his mother - Malawi's health minister Dr Jean Kalilani - who asked Madonna if her son could attend. Madonna is reported to have said: 'I'd like to be serenaded by a minister's son - please invite him.' Scroll down for video . Musicians: Madonna (right) posed for a photograph with Malawian hip hop star Tay Grin (left) at a party yesterday to celebrate the singer's first visit to the African country for 18 months . The musically-minded couple spoke for a while and sang together briefly to the invited guests that included politicians, US embassy staff, diplomats and employees of Madonna's charity Raising Malawi. The relatives of Madonna's two adopted Malawian children David and Mercy's were not on the guest list but some high school children being backed by Raising Malawi were invited. Tay Grin, also known as 'Nyau King', is Malawi's number one hip hop star and this year scooped the Best International African gong at the Black Entertainment Film Fashion Television and Arts awards in London. Madonna returned to Malawi today for the first time since her furious row with the country's former president 18 months ago. The singer is believed to have flown in this morning with the two children she adopted from the central African country and her other son for surprise talks with the new leader. Her visit will fuel speculation the star is looking to adopt another child after she posted pictures online today showing her playing with young Malawian children, apparently at an orphanage. Back in favour: Madonna shared this picture showing her playing with young Malawian children after arriving in the central African country for the first time since falling out with the former president in April last year . Sharing her experiences: The singer posted this selfie (left) on her Instagram page just before she arrived in Africa. She also posted a picture of a Malawian toddler (right) with the message: 'I just met a girl named Maria' Cute: Madonna shared this image of a Malawian child with the caption: 'Who's That Girl?' One follower replied: 'Is that your new baby girl? She's adorable! She's telling you with her eyes take me with you...' Madonna, who funds orphanages in the country and is helping to build schools and hospitals, was unceremoniously sent packing in April last year after a dispute with ex-president Joyce Banda. Mrs Banda attacked the pop star for being 'arrogant' and bizarrely accused her of being less well-mannered than footballers Gary Neville or Rio Ferdinand 'despite their equally dazzling stature'. A statement released by her office, which Mrs Banda later distanced herself from,  accused the star of wanting Malawi 'to be forever chained to the obligation of gratitude' for her charity work. It also claimed Madonna believed the country should have 'rolled out a red carpet and blast the 21-gun salute' upon her arrival. Mrs Banda, whose sister Anjimile Ntila-Oponyo used to run Madonna's Raising Malawi charity until her sacking over financial impropriety, stripped the singer of her 'Very Very Important Person' (VVIP) status. This fall-out forced Madonna, 56, to check into her private jet at Kamuzu International Airport as an 'ordinary passenger'. However, new president Peter Mutharika, who beat Banda at the May polls, has restored Madonna's VVIP status. Madonna with the two children she adopted in Malawi, David Banda (left) and Mercy James (right), in a classroom at Mkoko Primary School on a visit in April last year when she clashed with the  former president . Madonna mingles with children at Mkoko primary school in the region of Kasungu in March last year . State House press secretary Frederick Ndala said: 'We welcome Madonna as guest of the government and people of Malawi. 'The President appreciates the charity work she is doing for the people of Malawi.' Madonna is scheduled to hold talks with President Mutharika on Friday  at his official Kamuzu Palace in the capital, Lilongwe. Madonna's 12-member travelling party is believed to include sons Roco John Ritchie and David Banda and daughter Mercy Chifundo James. They are said to have arrived at Kamuzu International Airport in Lilongwe at 11am. 'We were asked to clear the airport's cargo bay for a special guest,' said an airport worker, who saw the jet land. He said Madonna was whisked into a fleet of SUVs and raced into town to Kumbali Lodge, a farm lodge she always stays at on her Malawi visits. Brotherly love: The proud Material Girl singer shared this Instagram picture of her son Rocco, 14, taking his siblings Mercy and David, both eight, to school in New York in September . Family flight: On Thursday the 56-year-old along with Mercy, David and Rocco flew into New York JFK after enjoying a long summer vacation in Europe earlier this year . Madonna first visited Malawi in 2006 after her Malawian friend Victoria Keelan told her about the impoverished southern African country's Aids situation. She immediately adopted then one-year-old David Banda at an orphanage. She adopted her second Malawian child, Mercy Chifundo James, in 2009, at another orphanage. She periodically visits Malawi, often with all her children - including daughter Lourdes, who has not made the trip this time around. She funds a number of orphanages, including Home of Hope in the western border district of Mchinji where she got David, and Kondanani Children's Home in the southern tea-growing district of Thyolo. She is also building a number of schools and a paediatrics ward at the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre - which she is scheduled to visit during her trip, according to sources.","Star reportedly arrived with two children she adopted from African nation .

"Unprecedented: President Obama is taking a personal interest in Mr Heywood's death . US President Barack Obama was told of the alleged murder of British businessman Neil Heywood before foreign . secretary William Hague. The president was briefed about the 41-year-old's suspected poisoning within hours of Chinese police . chief Wang Lijun walking into a US consulate to tell officials he was . murdered. The decision to inform the President so soon after the killing of a British citizen overseas so soon after it happened was described as 'almost unprecedented'. John Tkacik, who worked for the US . state department in China for 20 years told The Sunday Telegraph: 'This . was a very high official with extraordinary intelligence. 'In all of my . experience I can't recall its equal.' Mr Heywood's former business partner and powerful lawyer . Gu Kailai - wife of rising Communist leader Bo Xilai - is suspected of . ordering his murder and is under arrest. Last night it was claimed that the couple ordered a plane to be blown out of the sky in a bid to kill a rival politician's wife. China Northern Airlines flight 6136 . crashed into the sea by the port city of Dalian, where Bo was mayor, in May 2002. The . disaster killed 112 - including Li Yanfeng, wife of Han Xiaoguang, a . wealthy hotelier and ally of Bo's political opponents. Han was in jail at the time and Li . was returning from Beijing with letters pleading for his release which were written by the daughters of . Communist Party general secretary, Hu Jintao, and former president Li . Xiannian. Chinese journalist Jiang Weiping, who . was being held with Han after accusing the Communist Party of . embezzlement, told the Sunday Express details of the crash were covered . up and the black box was never discovered. Attack: Hackers are accused of targeting the website that has produced a string of explosive revelations about the relationship between Gu Kailai, left, and murdered ex-pat Neil Heywood, right . Jiang said Han told him he believes . Gu and Bo sabotaged the aircraft to assassinate his wife. He added: . 'Han's wife worked as the special assistant of the human resource . chief. 'After the crash, the officials . released a list of fatalities. Li Yanfeng's profile was basically blank, . listing only her name and deliberately left out her occupation and other . information. Sabotage: Wreckage of flight 6136 is pulled from the sea in May 2002 . 'If Bo was involved in the plot it . is likely that he wanted to eliminate the threat posed by Li Yanfeng, . as she knew too much about him.' The official news agency Xinhua . reported passenger Zhang Pilin - a former member of the secret police - . set fire to the plane in a suicide attack but others have dismissed this, claiming he was a scapegoat. It has also been claimed that Gu . killed TV presenter Zhang Weijie who was allegedly having an affair with . Bo and vanished after moving to Bejing. Chinese government hackers are . believed to be behind a crippling cyber attack on a US-based website . that revealed how Mr Heywood was killed with . cyanide on the orders of Gu. The . Boxun website, run by Chinese dissidents, first reported that Mr . Heywood was killed in his hotel room  after agreeing to syphon almost . £1billion out of the country for her. The . website said Old Harrovian Mr Heywood was killed after he asked for a . bigger cut and threatened to expose Mrs Gu if his demands were not met. The . cyber attack on Boxun paralysed the website for hours on Friday, . forcing it to find another internet hosting service to get back online. The . manager of the North Carolina-based site said Boxun had become a victim . of a ‘denial of service’ attack, with hackers bombarding it with . millions of requests per minute, causing it to crash. Questions remain: It is thought that Mr Heywood . was killed in one of the mountain-top hotel's £600-a-night villas, but . details of his demise are sketchy . The attack came five days after The . Mail on Sunday reported how sensational details of the Heywood case had . been revealed by Boxun and then  circulated on websites across China. Many . of the details of the murder  first reported by Boxun have since been . confirmed by diplomats and  officials close to the investigation. Mr . Heywood, was found dead in Chongqing in November. At the time, . Chinese authorities claimed he died of alcohol poisoning, while British . officials told his family that he had suffered a heart attack. His body . was cremated a day later without any post-mortem examination. Friends . said Mr Heywood was a moderate drinker. Suspicious: The reception area of the Nanshan . Lijing Holiday Hotel in Chongqing, China, where British businessman Neil . Heywood was found dead . Last month, Wang Lijun – the police chief of Chongqing – walked into a US consulate and claimed Mr Heywood had been poisoned. The scandal surrounding Mr Heywood’s death led to the purge of Mr Bo as the Communist party leader of Chongqing. Mr Bo, who was tipped to become a member of the nine-man Politburo that runs China, now faces an uncertain future. His 54-year-old wife is under arrest for ‘intentional homicide’ and faces the death penalty. Questions: Chinese officials are investigating . whether Mr Heywood was poisoned with cyanide after falling out with Mr . Bo (right) and his wife Gu Kailai (left) Last week, at least 11 people were arrested across Chongqing. Officials are struggling to contain the political fallout from the scandal as China  prepares for a once-in-a-decade leadership change in the autumn. Last week, The Mail on Sunday reported that Mr Heywood was  murdered after allegedly helping Mrs Gu syphon nearly £800 million of assets overseas. He is believed to have been poisoned with potassium cyanide by a henchman of Mr Bo. Boxun, which promotes human rights and democracy in China, has been targeted by Chinese government hackers in the past.

"Boston marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev was thrown out of his local mosque for 'crazy' behavior after getting involved a 'shouting match' with his imam according to one member of the congregation. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was ejected from his Boston mosque for aggressive behavior after insulting Martin Luther King Jr. during a Friday prayer service three months ago . Described as being full of rage by a worshiper who would give his name only as Muhammad, Tamerlan was ejected from the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center three months ago for claiming that Martin Luther King Jr. was not a man Muslims should look to emulate. This revelation comes as Ruslan Tsarni, an uncle of Tamerlan, claimed that his nephew had fallen under the spell of a mysterious religious leader in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who radicalized him and his brother Dzhokhar into committing Monday's terror outrage. The dramatic confrontation between Tamerlan and his imam began when the 26-year-old interrupted a solemn Friday prayer service three months ago. The imam had just offered up assassinated civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr. as a fine example of a man to emulate - but this reportedly enraged Tamerlan. 'You cannot mention this guy because he’s not a Muslim!' Muhammad recalled Tamerlan shouting, shocking others in attendance according to the LA Times. Kicked out of the mosque for his outrageous behavior, Tamerlan did return to the prayer service after his outburst according to Muhammad. 'He’s crazy to me,' said Muhammad. 'He had an anger inside.… I can’t explain what was in his mind.' Anwar Kazmi, a member of the mosque's board of trustees, told a USA Today reporter that 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who died early Friday morning after a shootout with police, was an infrequent attendee for about a year-and-a-half, while 19-year-old Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev, who was captured hiding in a boat in Watertown on Friday night, attended only once. Responding to the revelation that both brothers had attended their mosque, the Islamic Society issued a statement to say that while the suspects were known to other worshipers, they could not have predicted their horrific bombing of the Boston marathon which claimed three lives and injured over 180 people. Scroll Down for Video . The bombing suspects reportedly prayer and visited the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center infrequently . A banner reading ""United We Stand For Peace on Earth"" stands outside the Islamic Society of Boston mosque in Cambridge. A mosque official confirmed that suspects in the Boston Marathon bombings, worshipped there . Anwar Kazmi, a member of the mosque's board of trustees said that the Tsarnaev brothers were infrequent visitors to the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center . Imam Suhaib Webb, of the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center, the . city's largest mosque,  said in an interview that he had recently heard . of the incident. 'That's a sign right there that his views aren't . mainstream,' Webb said. They pledged to aid federal and city law enforcement to leave 'no stone uncovered in finding any suspects connected to the bombs.' Meanwhile, the Tsarnaev bother's uncle Ruslan Tsarni, who described the pair as 'losers' after they were named as suspects, raised the worrying possibility that they were radicalized by a domestic source and not a foreign one. The lawyer said that Tamerlan especially had fallen under the thrall of an as-yet unidentified religious leader while living in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Ruslan Tsarni says he grew concerned about Tamerlan Tsarnaev when he told him in a 2009 phone conversation that he had chosen 'God's business' over work or school. Tsarni said he then contacted a family friend who told him Tsarnaev had been influenced by a recent convert to Islam. 'There certainly were mentors,’’ Tsarni said to the Today show. 'I was shocked when I heard his words, his phrases, when every other word he starts sticking in words of God. I question what he’s doing for work, (and) he claimed he would just put everything in the will of God. 'It was a big concern to me. He called me 'confused' when I started explaining to him, make yourself useful to yourself and to your family and maybe you’ll have extra to share with everybody else.' 'I strongly believe they were just puppets and executors of something of bigger scale,' Tsarni told Savannah Guthrie. Ruslan Tsarni, uncle of Boston Marathon bombing suspect brothers, Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev and Tamerlan Tsarnaev believes 'they were just puppets and executors of something of bigger scale' The brothers are believed to have placed one of the bombs near to a Boston store where their mother had been sacked for stealing clothes . Yesterday the brothers¿ mother, Zubeidat, said the FBI once told her that Tamerlan was ¿really an extremist leader and that they were afraid of him' The Rhode Island resident told his nephew that 'he was giving up on everything, struggling with your own shadow' by whole heartedly turning to Islan. 'He had been sort of brainwashing him,' Tsarni told the Sunday Times of London. The brothers' parents told NBC News they believe their sons were framed and Tsarni said a family acquaintance told him there was an outside influence on Tamerlan. 'He said there is someone who brainwashed him, some new convert to Islam,’’ Tsarni said. “I would like to stress (the acquaintance was) of Armenian descent.’ [caption . Last night there were calls for Dzhokhar to be classified as an 'enemy combatant' The uncle also speculated that Tamerlan’s younger brother, Dzhokhar, was manipulated into the bombing plot. 'Dzhokhar is just a kid who wanted to have older brother to look up at. Except for being a murderer, he’s been a loving brother.' 'That so-called radicalization was seeded right here, not in the Caucasus, not in Russia, not in Chechnya, which he has nothing to do with,' Tsarni said. The extremist views which Tamerlan developed over the course of the past three years caught the attention of Russian security officals who asked the FBI to question him in 2011 - before he traveled to Chechnya and Dagestan last year. The FBI are said to have discovered nothing incriminating during their conversations with Tamerlan. However, friends said that Tamerlan became increasingly vocal in his views, especially concerning Christians. 'He said . . . the Koran spoke more of the truth then the Bible. He said the Bible was used as an excuse to invade other countries,' said Albrecht Ammon, 18, a student at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, which the bombers also attended according to the New York Post. And it has been revealed today that Tamerlan had direct contact with Chechen terrorists – and was ‘monitored’ by investigators for five years. The FBI put Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, under surveillance after receiving an explicit warning from the Russian intelligence services. Rebel: One theory is that Tamerlan Tsarnaev was inspired by Doku Umarov, a Chechen terrorist known as Russia's Bin Laden . Umarov has recently widened his fight for Chechen independence to a wider Jihadist agenda . But despite apparently telling his mother that Tamerlan was an ‘extremist’ leader, the FBI eventually discounted the possibility that he was a threat. Yesterday the brothers’ mother, Zubeidat, said the FBI once told her that Tamerlan was ‘really an extremist leader and that they were afraid of him’. She added: ‘He was controlled by the FBI for five years. They knew what my son was doing. They were following every step of his.’ And his father, Anzor Tsarnaev, said investigators warned his  son: ‘We know what sites you are on, we know where you are calling,  we know everything about you.  Everything. We are checking and watching.’ Russia's Bin Laden Doku Umarov was believed to be behind the Moscow Metro bombing in 2010 which killed at least 40 . Despite all this, the FBI found no substantive evidence that he was engaged in terror-related activities though they continued to ‘monitor his internet use and contacts’. According to an intelligence source, Russia remained convinced that Tamerlan, an ethnic Chechen, was in ‘direct contact’ with Islamist militants, most likely based in the strife-torn southern Russian region of Dagestan, where he lived for two years with his family prior to moving to the US. During a six-month visit to Russia last year – a trip US investigators are investigating –  it is understood Tamerlan visited Dagestan, which is now regarded as more unstable than Chechnya. One theory is that Tamerlan and Dzhokhar, who was in thrall to his older brother, may have been ‘inspired’ by a rebel leader known as Russia’s Bin Laden. A light beam from a helicopter, top right, aims in the direction of Watertown, where officials searched for Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev on Friday . Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is apprehended on Friday evening after almost 24-hours on the run following a week of terror in Boston . Doku Umarov, like the Tsarnaev brothers, is an ethnic Chechen from the war-torn Caucasus region that lies between Europe and Central Asia. He has been accused of masterminding some of the worst terrorist atrocities in Russia, including suicide bombings carried out by two women on Moscow’s Metro system in 2010 which killed at least 40. Significantly, while Umarov was originally fighting only for Chechen independence he has more recently embraced a wider jihadist agenda. It raises the terrifying prospect of further atrocities being carried out across the globe by disaffected individuals inspired by the jihadist rhetoric of the former Chechen leaders. Intriguingly, President Putin offered to ‘provide assistance’ to the investigation in Boston before it was known that there was a Chechen link to the bombing. ‘Fighting terrorism is more important than political posturing,’ said a Russian source yesterday. ‘If we work together properly and deeply, we have much more chance of defeating those who want to maim and kill.’","Tamerlan Tsarnaev was ejected from his Cambridge, Massachusetts mosque three months ago .

"Do you regularly 'detox' with a green tea or a wheatgrass juice and pack your diet full of chia seeds and acai berry all in the hope of improving your cholesterol, combating cancer and promoting weight loss? Are you among the millions who believe oysters are an aphrodisiac, boosting your sex drive? Every day across the world scientists publish countless studies into the health benefits of various foods, prompting new food fads, and encouraging millions to invest in 'the' latest superfood. Frustrated by the constant stream of conflicting scientific evidence, one data journalist and information designer from London was inspired to 'wade through the murk' to offer people a little light in the confusion. David McCandless, author of the book Information Is Beautiful, began collating thousands of scientific studies to produce a stunning interactive Snake Oil Superfoods infographic to inform people and ensure 'they aren't duped'. The 43-year-old embarked on the challenge with Dr Miriam Quick, investigating the evidence to establish which studies 'really stand up to the test of science', promising 'solid scientific evidence for extra health benefits of certain foods'. A new infographic that was four years in the making reveals the grade of scientific evidence behind various so-called superfoods. Data journalist David McCandless was inspired to collate the information after becoming frustrated with the confusing number of scientific studies . The finished, though ever-evolving, product divides a vast range of foods into those backed by 'strong', 'good', 'promising', 'inconclusive', 'some', 'slight', and 'no evidence' categories. And the majority sit in the inconclusive to no evidence range. There is no evidence oysters are good for your sex life. There is only 'some' evidence to back the theory that green tea is beneficial to cholesterol levels, the proof that wheatgrass is good for your general health, that chia seeds boost weight loss and heart health and acai berry helps in the fight against cancer and boost weight loss is only slight. But it is not all bad news. There is strong evidence that three grams of the sugars found in oats and barley each day helps lower blood cholesterol, and that garlic really can help lower blood pressure, especially for those with raised blood pressure. Meanwhile there is 'good' proof that almonds consistently lower 'bad' cholesterol in healthy people as well as those with high cholesterol and diabetes. And the scientific basis for another new superfood, coconut oil, boosting weight loss is 'promising,' according to the infographic. Mr McCandless told MailOnline: 'This is really a sequel to a previous graphic about supplements, collating the nutritional information of supplements from Vitamin D to Goji berries. The graphic divides various foods into seven categories, rating the quality of the evidence for the health claims - strong, good, promising, inconclusive, some, slight and no evidence. Hovering over the various foods allows the reader to link back to scientific studies . 'We first created that around four years ago and it has evolved over several years. 'I realised there were lots of foods claiming to be superfoods, and beneficial for your health. So about two years ago we started researching, it took about nine months in total, though not full time. 'With supplements it is slightly easier because they can be tested in clinical trials. But with foods it is harder to test exactly how they affect the body. 'A lot of the evidence is from epidemiological studies, a survey of a population for example. The grade of scientific evidence is slightly lower. 'They might identify a beneficial chemical in red wine, for example, and then infer that food or drink carries the benefit.' Mr McCandless told MailOnline he is 'a bit of a health freak', and so was inspired by his own curiosity to produce the 'ever-evolving' piece of work. 'I try to live a super healthy lifestyle but have been frustrated by the grade of the evidence,' he said. 'I was left trying to find some sense in the murk. One day a study would say something was good for you, and the next would contradict it. 'We want the graphic to act as a filter, allowing us to share the information with people. 'We spent a lot of time collating the information, to make sure people aren't duped - that's the real goal.' The infographic features in Mr McCandless' book, Information Is Beautiful. His book Knowledge Is Beautiful is also out now. Mr McCandless said the piece of work is 'ever-evolving' as the team at Information Is Beautiful constantly update it, as new studies emerge .","Data journalist David McCandless began research for the infographic two years ago .

"Cradled lovingly in her mother’s arms, this is beautiful Beatrice Octavia Iris Smith, whose tragic story moved the Duchess of Cambridge to tears this week. Born a year ago today, with a crop of flame-red hair and mischievous brown eyes, she was just 89 days old when she died from a rare heart condition, holding her inconsolable parents’ hands. On Tuesday, her grieving mother, Leigh, spoke publicly about her family’s utter devastation at losing their beloved ‘Bea’. Scroll down for video . Courageous: Even though she had to be fitted with a feeding tube, little Beatrice Smith endured her symptoms and gruelling treatment with remarkable braver and calmness . Wide-eyed: Curious to the last, little Beatrice gazes around the room as her mother looks on adoringly . At times she struggled to hold her emotions in check, apologising — not that it was needed — for her faltering voice. Mrs Smith also talked of her hope that her tiny daughter’s battle for life would inspire others to build a £10 million hospice in Norfolk for other children suffering from life-limiting illnesses. Her heartbreaking honesty prompted Kate — who is 18 weeks pregnant with her second child — to throw her arms around her afterwards and whisper: ‘You’re a very brave lady. I’m just so, so sorry.’ Though today she should have been celebrating Beatrice’s first birthday, Mrs Smith has written a deeply moving account of her daughter’s cruelly short life, in order to highlight the remarkable work of East Anglia’s Children’s Hospices (EACH), of which the Duchess is royal patron. She has also given permission for the Mail to publish these remarkable photographs of the baby girl with the enchanting smile who touched so many lives. Tragically, they were taken just hours before Beatrice, who had been born small but apparently healthy, was taken into hospital for the last time. Mrs Smith, a 33-year-old physiotherapist, her husband, Toby, and their four-year-old son, Elliot, had spent that January day with their friend, photographer Rob Dodsworth. Despite being fitted with a feeding tube, brave Beatrice accepted her condition without protest — just plenty of smiles. The family, who live near Norwich, enjoyed a remarkably idyllic afternoon at their local park, splashing in puddles and enjoying the fresh air. Fragile: Bea's tiny fingers - she would later die in hospital while holding both her parents' hands . Tender: A kiss from Leigh as dad Toby cradles Beatirce on their final day out before she was taken to hospital . But just hours later, Beatrice’s condition deteriorated. She was given emergency ventilation and, after treatment locally, was rushed to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH). Mrs Smith remembers: ‘Over the next few weeks, our immensely brave girl battled so hard, giving everything she had. The courage Bea showed for someone so young was inspirational. ‘Sadly, her mountain proved too hard to climb for someone so young, and she became frailer and weaker. As a mother, watching this was agony. 'We knew our little girl was just too tired and could fight her battle no longer. ‘On February 24, 2014, she sadly passed away in my arms at Great Ormond Street, holding her Mummy’s and Daddy’s hands. We were, and are, devastated.’ Beatrice’s death came just weeks after the family had spent a first blissful Christmas together, entirely unaware of her condition. Empathy: The Duchess of Cambridge was pictured in tears earlier this week after meeting Leigh, who she described as 'very brave' ‘For six weeks we enjoyed a normal life as a new family of four, enjoying Christmas with our beautiful Bea. Our amazing little girl completed us as a family,’ her mother recalls. But in early January Beatrice became unwell, struggling to feed or breathe. She quickly developed cardiac failure and it was later confirmed that she had a very rare disease of the heart: restrictive cardiomyopathy. ‘We, as a family, were in shock that our little girl could have been so poorly and we had no idea,’ Mrs Smith says. ‘She was so perfect. Our joy and excitement became despair.’ It was in the days after Beatrice’s death that EACH stepped in, taking her tiny body back to its hospice at Quidenham, Norfolk, and allowing the family the chance to say their precious farewells in private. ‘As soon as we arrived we were made to feel at home,’ Mrs Smith says. ‘She arrived in a Moses basket and had her own room, with her name on the door, and was cared for with such respect and dignity by everyone. ‘As parents, we could not have asked for a better way to say goodbye in the worst of situations. She looked angelic.’ EACH was instrumental in helping to organise their baby’s funeral at a time when, Mrs Smith admits, ‘we were barely functioning’. Mr and Mrs Smith say the help of the hospice has been ‘invaluable in our darkest times’. It was in the aftermath of their loss that Mrs Smith wrote to the Duchess about the support they’d received. ‘I was so touched to receive her reply, hand-signed, and obviously written from the heart. It was clear from her words that she is so passionate about children’s hospice care and EACH.’ Later, she was invited to meet the Duchess at Tuesday’s launch of a fundraising campaign to help EACH build its new facility. It was, she says, a moment she will never forget. ‘As the Duchess was leaving, she made a detour to find me, having to weave around a table and high chair, and gave me a hug. It was lovely. She just said I “was such a brave lady”. ‘She was a bit teary-eyed, and I certainly was. I think it just proves how much she cares, and how natural she is as a person, showing such empathy and understanding as a mother.’ While Mrs Smith admits it has been a ‘difficult’ few days, she takes some comfort in how the story of Beatrice’s bravery may help to support other families in the same desperate situation. ‘As a parent, you hope that your children will make you proud,’ she says. ‘My little girl has achieved more in her 89 days of life through the telling of her story, and what she has inspired, than I think most of us could achieve in a lifetime.’ To learn more about and donate to The Nook Appeal, which will raise funds for a new Children’s Hospice in Norfolk, visit each.org.uk/the-nook or call the Norfolk fundraising office on 01953 666 767.","Beatrice, known to family as Bea, died of a heart condition at 89 days old .

"One of the brothers suspected of the Boston Marathon bombings had direct contact with Chechen terrorists – and was ‘monitored’ by investigators for five years. The Mail on Sunday has learned that the FBI put Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, under surveillance after receiving an explicit warning from the Russian intelligence services. But despite apparently telling his mother that Tamerlan was an ‘extremist’ leader, the FBI eventually discounted the possibility that he was a threat. Scroll down for video . Rebel: One theory is that Tamerlan Tsarnaev was inspired by Doku Umarov, a Chechen terrorist known as Russia's Bin Laden . Tamerlan was shot dead by police early on Friday while his 19-year-old brother Dzhokhar was captured alive but seriously injured with neck and leg injuries on Friday night. He had been hiding in a boat in a suburban backyard. Last night new details about Dzhokhar’s dramatic capture were released. Police said he fired at them from his hiding place but, weak through loss of blood from the bullet wounds he had sustained in the shoot-out with police earlier, he eventually gave himself up. ‘He was so weak that we were able to just go in and scoop him up,’ said a police spokesman. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was a promising boxer before his ambitions were dashed by a back injury . More details also emerged of the shoot-out after the brothers were cornered in a stolen Mercedes 4x4. Police said Tamerlan burst out of the car shooting at officers. ‘There were six police officers in this very tight area engaged in a gunfight,’ said police chief Edward Deveau. ‘During the exchange, all of a sudden, something got thrown at my police officers and there was a major explosion,’ he said. In all, there were three explosions  and 200 rounds were fired during the five-to-ten minute exchange. It ended when Tamerlan ran out of ammunition, He was on the ground being handcuffed when he was run over by his younger brother as he escaped in the car. While Dzhokhar’s capture ended a week of tension and drama in Boston, triggering scenes of jubilation and self-congratulation among law enforcement officers, questions will now be asked about how the brothers managed to slip the net. US congressmen have expressed concern that the tip-off about Tamerlan to the FBI from Moscow may not have been properly followed through. Yesterday the brothers’ mother, Zubeidat, said the FBI once told her that Tamerlan was ‘really an extremist leader and that they were afraid of him’. She added: ‘He was controlled by the FBI for five years. They knew what my son was doing. They were following every step of his.’ And his father, Anzor Tsarnaev, said investigators warned his  son: ‘We know what sites you are on, we know where you are calling,  we know everything about you.  Everything. We are checking and watching.’ The brothers are believed to have placed one of the bombs near to a Boston store where their mother had been sacked for stealing clothes . Yesterday the brothers¿ mother, Zubeidat, said the FBI once told her that Tamerlan was ¿really an extremist leader and that they were afraid of him' Despite all this, the FBI found no substantive evidence that he was engaged in terror-related activities though they continued to ‘monitor his internet use and contacts’. According to an intelligence source, Russia remained convinced that Tamerlan, an ethnic Chechen, was in ‘direct contact’ with Islamist militants, most likely based in the strife-torn southern Russian region of Dagestan, where he lived for two years with his family prior to moving to the US. During a six-month visit to Russia last year – a trip US investigators are investigating –  it is understood Tamerlan visited Dagestan, which is now regarded as more unstable than Chechnya. One theory is that Tamerlan and Dzhokhar, who was in thrall to his older brother, may have been ‘inspired’ by a rebel leader known as Russia’s Bin Laden. Doku Umarov, like the Tsarnaev brothers, is an ethnic Chechen from the war-torn Caucasus region that lies between Europe and Central Asia. He has been accused of masterminding some of the worst terrorist atrocities in Russia, including suicide bombings carried out by two women on Moscow’s Metro system in 2010 which killed at least 40. Significantly, while Umarov was originally fighting only for Chechen independence he has more recently embraced a wider jihadist agenda. Threats: Umarov has been accused of being behind some of Russia's worst terrorist atrocities . Umarov has recently widened his fight for Chechen independence to a wider Jihadist agenda . Chechen expert Dr Carlo Gallo, the founder of London-based political risk firm Enquirisk, explained: ‘Umarov has made statements in which he has said that the enemy of Islam is not just Russia but America, though the insurgents have never conducted significant operations outside Russia.’ It raises the terrifying prospect of further atrocities being carried out across the globe by disaffected individuals inspired by the jihadist rhetoric of the former Chechen leaders. Last night as calls were made for Dzhokhar to be classified as an ‘enemy combatant’, the brothers’ uncle, Ruslan Tsarni, said Dzhokhar had been ‘used’ by his older brother who had fallen under the influence of a US-based radical of Armenian descent who ‘brainwashed’ him. Mr Tsarni said that when he met his nephew in 2009 he was troubled by his transformation. ‘I was shocked when I heard his words, his phrases. He claimed he would just put everything in the will of God. It wasn’t devotion, it was, as it’s called, being radicalised.’ For many years, though, Tamerlan and his younger brother had seemed settled in the United States. They were popular at school and excelled at sport. Intriguingly Russian President Vladimir Putin offered to 'provide assistance' to the Bostom bombing investigation before any link was made to Chechnya . Settled: Tamerlan and Dzhokhar were popular at school in America and excelled in sport . Tamerlan visited war-torn Dagestan, which is now considered even more unstable than Chechnya . Russia's Bin Laden Doku Umarov was believed to be behind the Moscow Metro bombing in 2010 which killed at least 40 . But it became clear yesterday that it was a series of setbacks in Tamerlan’s personal life that rendered him increasingly bitter. Individually, none seems particularly significant, but cumulatively they were  devastating and caused him to turn against his adopted homeland. Tamerlan was a promising boxer, possibly destined for the US Olympic team, but his dream was shattered by a back injury. At the same time he could only manage to secure menial work, though he was considered bright at school. He was devastated when his best friend was killed in 2011 in an unsolved murder and then came an incident which investigators believe is particularly significant. He was arrested for assaulting his girlfriend in 2009 – which scuppered his chance of obtaining American citizenship. An intelligence source said: ‘There is a view that this more than anything set him against the USA.’ [caption . After his trip to Russia and Dagestan, . Tamerlan returned to the US to discover that his mother had been sacked . from Lord & Taylor department store in Natick, Massachusetts, for . allegedly stealing clothes. This further enraged him and he became more outspoken in his criticism of America. The brothers are believed to have placed one of their bombs near the company’s Boston store, possibly in revenge. A Moscow secret services source indicated yesterday that there had been contact between the two countries during the manhunt, saying that ‘joint work was organised through partner channels’. Intriguingly, President Putin offered to ‘provide assistance’ to the investigation in Boston before it was known that there was a Chechen link to the bombing. ‘Fighting terrorism is more important than political posturing,’ said a Russian source yesterday. ‘If we work together properly and deeply, we have much more chance of defeating those who want to maim and kill.’ Last night the brothers’ parents defended them, as one lay dead and the other critically ill but stable in hospital. Mr Tsarnaev said there was nothing suspicious about his son’s 2012 visit to Dagestan.‘He wasn’t occupied with anything. He was just visiting relatives,’ he said. ‘I knew what he was doing, where he was going. ‘I raised my children right,’ he added. ‘This is all lies. These are my children. I know my children.’ Tamerlan is thought to have grown a long beard after returning to Boston from his trip to Russia. Police believe he shaved it off some weeks ago because he wished to remain inconspicuous as he planned the bombing. While denying involvement in any militant form of Islam, Mr Tsarnaev confirmed that the family was religious. ‘What kind of Islam? In Islam we have purity,’ he said. ‘We do what we’re supposed to. We pray five times a day. That’s it.’ And denying that her sons would have hidden any secret extremist leanings from her, his wife said:   ‘That’s impossible. My sons would never keep a secret. Never ever is this true, my sons are innocent!’ Mr Tsarnaev added that he had spoken to Tamerlan after the marathon outrage, telling him: ‘Thanks to Allah you were not close to there and did not suffer.’ He added: ‘I remember I even asked, “Who could do something like that?” ’","Russian intelligence services warned agency about Tamerlan Tsarnaev .

"Take That has become the latest band to snub Spotify by cutting a deal with Google for the internet giant to exclusively stream its new album. The group has teamed up with Google Play Music to enable their new release, called III, to be streamed via the company as of Monday when it goes on sale.

Take That pictured performing their single These Days on the X Factor earlier this week . Earlier this month Taylor Swift removed her entire back catalogue from the firm's service just days before releasing her album 1989. The move was taken to help drive sales rather than allowing people to listen to it for free - she claimed albums should be listened to and consumed in full as a piece of 'art'. It triggered an extremely public spat between the company and Swift, with Spotify chief executive Daniel Ek hitting back to claim his organisation had paid $2billion (£1.2billion) in artist royalties since the company's inception. Furthermore, he argued the service should be compared to free radio broadcasting, rather than traditional album sales. Spotify has been heavily criticised recently for the level of royalties it pays to artists . He said: 'You can't look at Spotify in isolation – even though Taylor can pull her music off Spotify (where we license and pay for every song we've ever played), her songs are all over services and sites like YouTube and Soundcloud, where people can listen all they want for free.' But criticism of Spotify hasn't just been limited to Swift, with ACDC and Radiohead both previously expressing frustration at its royalties scheme. Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke withdrew his project Atoms for Peace from Spotify in 2013 and launched an angry Twitter tirade over its royalty rates. 'Make no mistake new artists you discover on #Spotify will no get paid,' he posted. 'Meanwhile shareholders will shortly being rolling in it. Simples.' Take That  - who lost long-time member Jason Orange this year - will also play an album launch party for a handful of fans which is being hosted by internet giant Google in central London. Their other albums continue to be available to fans, despite the announcement tonight that their label Polydor has struck a deal with Google. It is said to be 'the first time they have partnered so extensively with a digital platform'. A statement from the group said: 'We would like to thank Google Play for coming up with such a great, creative campaign around the release of an album we're extremely proud of. 'We also wanted to do something different for this release and are looking forward to seeing it come to life, kicking off with a very special album launch party on Monday for a small number of some of our biggest supporters.'

Seymour was also at today's weigh-in - wearing a pair of baby blue boxer shorts, teamed with socks and sandals. The pair will take to the ring ahead of a match between Russia's Ruslan Provodnikov and Jose Luis Castillo of Mexico. Sovetsky Sport sports website reported earlier this week that the American actor was quoted as saying by promoters: 'Boxing is a serious part of my life. It taught me respect and determination, patience and concentration. I always dreamed of fighting a match in Russia.' Good sports! The pair will take to the ring on Friday ahead of a match between Russia's Ruslan Provodnikov and Jose Luis Castillo of Mexico. Hats off: It will mark Mickey's first boxing match in 20 years after The Wrestler star formerly hung up his boxing gloves . On Wednesday Mickey was pictured training with boxing coach Marvin Somodio, who is legendary trainer Freddie Roach's assistant. The Pope Of Greenwich Village actor displayed his sculpted physique inked over with various tattoos on his chest and arms as his new 'do was kept perfectly in place for the grueling training session. Coach Somodio held up focus mitts as Rourke worked some combinations with a sweat jacket on and white boxing gloves. Later he was seen doing some conditioning work as he held up a large weightlifter's plate to strengthen his core and deltoids.

The actor was an amateur boxer before his Hollywood career took off and he became a sex symbol star in films such as '9 1/2 Weeks.' He returned to boxing as a professional for eight matches in the 1990s, causing damage to his face that necessitated surgery and changed his appearance. In 2008 he starred in The Wrestler about a washed-up fighter making a comeback, winning a Golden Globe for best actor. Rourke is a frequent visitor to Russia and has been romantically linked to a Russian-born model, Anastassija Makarenko. Fighting fit? Rourke is set to fight 29-year-old Elliot Seymour on November 28 in Moscow . 'Mickey Rourke is in a perfect bodily condition and he has had spars with young boxers in Russia,' sports manager Maxim Kornilov told TASS, a Russian news agency. He represents the interests of the former world champion in welterweight, Ruslan Provodnikov. 'Given his age 62 years old - he is in a perfect shape,' Kornilov said. 'He continues training for the fight now.' 'Mickey did appear in spars with young boxers and we'll wait and see his performance on the prize-ring,' he said. 'I think he'll cope with the task because he has a wealth of experience. Back in the day: Rourke was a professional boxer before he took up a career in acting. He began at the age of 12 and made a brief comeback to the ring in 1991 before hanging up his boxing gloves in 1994 .

"The president of Turkey has tried to re-write history by claiming Muslim explorers beat Christopher Columbus to discovering America by more than 300 years. Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Saturday that Islamic sailors found the New World in 1178 and built a mosque on Cuba - and even said Columbus saw it when he showed up in 1492. His theory - which is not supported by most historians - came to light in a televised speech during an Istanbul summit of Muslims leaders from Latin America. Theory: Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish president, made the claims Saturday at a meeting with Latin American leaders . He brought up the supposed connection in a bid to establish a long history for links between his country and the distant continent. He said: 'Contacts between Latin America and Islam date back to the 12th century. Muslims discovered America in 1178, not Christopher Columbus. 'Muslim sailors arrived in America from 1178. Columbus mentioned the existence of a mosque on a hill on the Cuban coast.' Explorer: Christopher Columbus is pictured above arriving in America and claiming the land for the Spanish royal family in 1492 . He even offered to build a mosque in the country - which currently does not have any. Erdogan said: 'I would like to talk about it to my Cuban brothers. A mosque would go perfectly on the hill today.' The notion that Columbus mentioned a mosque in his diary, first floated in 1996, is widely understood to be a misunderstanding. Instead, the passage in question is thought to be metaphor which describes the shape of the land. As a Spaniard, Columbus would have been very familiar with Islamic architecture as Muslims still ruled parts of Spain during his lifetime.","Receo Tayyip Erdogan made claim in a speech to Latin American leaders .

"A Good Samaritan who returned a wallet filled with several hundreds of dollars in cash proves that good people do exist. Joyce Gardner of Waterford, Connecticut found a wallet with $726.00 of cash inside and instead of considering it her lucky day and running off with it she returned it to police and made someone’s holiday much brighter. Waterford Police said that when Gardner handed the wallet over to authorities she said, 'Tell the woman have a nice Thanksgiving.'

"Ride sharing firm Uber has been forced to suspend its services in the U.S. state of Nevada after a judge issued the firm with an injunction. The judge from a Washoe County District Court issued a preliminary injunction preventing the company from operating statewide  on Tuesday. It issued the legal ban on behalf of the state saying Uber refused to comply with state laws regulating commercial motor carriers which could put the public's safety at risk. Ban: A judge from a Washoe County District Court issued the company with a preliminary injunction . Authorities have long held many concerns over the popular ride-sharing firm; passenger safety is just one of them along with their ability to muscle in on licensed  taxi drivers' revenue. Companies such as Uber allow passengers to summon cars using apps on their smartphones, rather than calling a taxi company. They have gained popularity in dozens of U.S. cities and international countries over the past few years. But in Nevada, the attorney general filed a lawsuit last month arguing that the Internet application  infringes on the franchise rights of taxi companies and cabdrivers. The law suit could lead to a trial in the future. A spokesperson for Uber said that the ban in Nevada could cost 1,000 jobs. 'It's unfortunate that Nevada is the first state in the nation to temporarily suspend Uber,' spokeswoman Eva Behrend said in a statement. Yet critics of the Delaware-based company continue to grow. In September, taxi drivers in London staged a mass demonstration over the ride-sharing app in September. Up to 5,000 black cab drivers blockaded London's city center yesterday in protest against a boom in unlicensed minicabs and rickshaws as well as the hugely popular Uber smartphone app. Big Ben rises in the background over the Houses of Parliament as black cab drivers blockade Parliament Square in protest against the boom in unlicensed minicabs and rickshaw drivers on the streets of London . Protest: Taxi drivers gather next to the Olympia Stadium in Berlin, Germany, to protest the app in June . Drivers in San Francisco have also expressed their dismay over the app suggesting it has led to soaring competition from unlicensed drivers. In Germany, a regional German court issued a temporary injunction against Uber in September, saying its drivers lacked necessary commercial permits. Meanwhile, Singapore recently announced new rules for mobile taxi booking apps, like Uber, in the latest move by governments around the world to regulate the services. Singapore's Land Transport Authority said the apps will soon have to apply for a three-yearly 'certificate of registration' starting from the second quarter of next year. The firm faced even more problems recently after reports emerged that executive Emil Michael wanted to hire ‘opposition researchers’ to dig up dirt on journalists who were critical of the company. The company has come under such fire recently that its CEO Travis Kalanick raised gasps at a conference by comparing his firm's problems  to the repression faced by demonstrators in Ferguson. 'Weird analogy: Uber CEO and co-founder Travis Kalanick, who compared his company's problems with Las Vegas taxi regulators to the problems faced by people demonstrating against police brutality in Ferguson . Travis Kalanick was speaking at a tech conference hosted by investment bank Goldman Sachs. He said his  problems in Las Vegas were similar to those faced by anti-police brutality demonstrators in Ferguson, Pando Daily reports. But he insists that his company is a technology business and not a taxi firm. Yet, despite its myriad of issues, the young upstart company is proving to be popular and is close to raising between $35 billion and $40 billion in their latest round of funding insiders told Bloomberg. Behrend said: 'We will continue to work with regulators and state leaders as we evaluate this development.’ ‘We remain committed to working with Nevada's leaders to create a permanent regulatory framework that affords Nevadans the flexibility and innovation offered by Uber,’ she added.","The judge issued the injunction to stop the firm operating in the state .

"A set of rules for white people at a vigil for Michael Brown in Canada has sparked controversy with critics accusing organizers of promoting segregation. 'Non black allies' were told to 'refrain from taking up space in all ways possible' and 'never be at the centre of anything' at the event in Toronto on November 25. The Facebook page also advised white demonstrators to 'refrain from speaking to the media' and 'stand behind black folks or between us and the police'. Scroll down for video . Controversial: These were the guidelines suggested to white supporters at an anti-racism protest in Canada . Tensions: The grand jury's refusal to indict white police officer Darren Wilson for the shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown has sparked protests against racism across the US, Canada and Europe . 'If you see a cop harassing a black person,' it added, 'come in and engage (chances are they are least likely to arrest you)'. It has provoked tension in the wake of the grand jury verdict in Ferguson, which refused to indict officer Darren Wilson for the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown. Protests have been staged across the United States and Canada, and further afield, after Michael Brown's shooting highlighted severe racial divides between the majority white police force and citizens in Ferguson, a predominantly African American suburb of St Louis, Missouri. Millions of people have taken to the streets across the globe to protest racism and segregation.

"Arrest: Courtney Lynn Stewart's son weighed less than 15 pounds when she took him to hospital . A 24-year-old mother starved and abused her three-year-old twin sons, leaving one so malnourished that he weighed less than 15 pounds, authorities have said. Courtney Lynn Stewart's other son was also found to be badly malnourished and with a fractured jaw when police went to her Murietta, California home, they said on Wednesday. Authorities began investigating the young mother after the Rancho Springs Hospital contacted police when one of the boys was taken to the hospital in critical condition on November 7. Staff said the boy weighed less than 15 pounds and had suspicious bruises over his body. The youngster was rushed to Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where he remains in critical condition, officials said . Investigators then visited Stewart's home and found the boy's twin brother, who was severely malnourished. He had been medically neglected and had a fractured jaw, police said. He was also taken to hospital for treatment and is now under the care of Riverside County Child Protective Services. Stewart has been arrested and charged on suspicion of willful harm or injury to a child and corporal punishment or injury to a child and remains in jail. Scene: When police went to her home in Murietta, California (the neighborhood is pictured), they found her second twin son with a broken jaw. He was also malnourished and has been hospitalized . Neighbors told NBC Los Angeles that she had another, older boy but that they never saw the younger two children. 'Never saw the two little ones, only the older one,' the shocked neighbor said.

"Roberto Martinez has accused Chelsea's players of trying to influence referees and believes their pressure cost Everton at Stamford Bridge.

Roberto Martinez expressed his bitter disappointment how an ill-tempered game was settled against Chelsea . Martinez feels referee Jon Moss was subject to constant pressure and he has taken Jose Mourinho - who has appeared on Goals On Sunday to express his displeasure about the perceived 'campaign' that Chelsea have endured this season - to task for how his squad behaved. Unfortunately, the sending off really late on reflected the emphasis that the home team had in trying to influence the referee and take advantage of their role of playing at Stamford Bridge,' wrote Martinez. 'Mo Besic being booked after five minutes was a very loose way to referee a game and there was no need to show as many yellow cards as there were. Branislav Ivanovic clashes with James McCarthy as players tussle match between Chelsea and Everton . 'But, more importantly, I never felt there was any consistency in judging every action equally between the two teams. 'That made it a tougher way to digest a defeat that we didn't deserve and showed a very similar ending to last season's game at Stamford Bridge.

"Lemon slices and a spread of hummus and crudite are just some of Hillary Clinton's demands when she gives her $300,000 guest lectures. Her requests were detailed in emails exchanged between officials at the University of California at Los Angeles and Clinton's representatives. The correspondence, which took place over nearly a year,  was obtained by The Washington Post under a Freedom of Information Act request. Hillary Rodham Clinton is presented with a medal by the University of California Los Angeles' chief executive officer, and Chancellor, Gene Block at the University of California Los Angeles, UCLA campus . The exchanges  reveal five days her representatives requested the award (pictured) she was to be presented with should be in a box - not draped around her neck . Her representatives asked for a case of still water, room temperature, to be deposited on the stage. They also requested that 'a carafe of warm/hot water, coffee cup and saucer, pitcher of room temperature water, water glass, and lemon wed­ges' be situated on a table on stage. They also wanted them to be placed in another room where Clinton would stand for photos with VIPs -  the agreement was she would pose for individual photos with 100 VIPS, or 50 couples. For the green room, Clinton's representatives requested: 'Coffee, tea, room temp sparkling and still water, diet ginger ale, crudité, hummus and sliced fruit.' The university had to buy a a computer, mouse and printer, as well as a scanner,for her visit. The emails reveal university officials debating the style and color of the  armchairs for Clinton and moderator at her Luskin Lecture for Thought Leadership speech on March 5, 2014 as well as the pillows. Her representatives requested two long, rectangular pillows be put on the chairs. Clinton says all of the money she receives from speaking engagements goes towards her family's charity, the Clinton Global Initiative . The exchanges also reveal five days before the lecture Clinton’s team rejected the podium planned for her use and had to get an new one and rent a new university seal to match and that the award she was to be presented with should be in a box - not draped around her neck. The university asked whether there was a reduced rate for public universities to which they were told $300,000 is the 'special university rate.' The likely 2016 presidential candidate fees have been well-documented. Earlier thus year she defended the nearly quarter-million dollar fee she charges for speaking engagements at colleges and universities after students at one university demanded that she return the fee. Clinton said that the enormous sums of money she has collected for speeches have gone towards her family's charity, The Clinton Foundation. Clinton's wealth has been under scrutiny since an interview earlier this year in which she described her family as 'dead broke' and in debt when husband Bill Clinton left the White House in January 2001. Combined, Bill and Hillary Clinton have a net worth of more than $100 million . The potential 2016 presidential candidate later called that description 'inartful.' 'All of the fees have been donated to the Clinton Foundation for it to continue its life-changing and life-saving work. So it goes from a foundation at a university to another foundation,' Clinton said during an interview with ABC News when asked about the criticism she and her husband have faced recently for their wealth. Clinton defended her fee by saying that her speaking engagements are used to present 'new ideas to help strengthen the economy, which in turn, will help lower income inequality.' 'It’s been my experience,' Clinton said, 'That they’re not worried about my speaking or my household, they’re worried about their own. And that’s the kind of debate I think I’m furthering as I go around the country speaking.'","Her requests were detailed in emails exchanged between officials at the University of California at Los Angeles and Clinton's representatives .

"The parents of a gay son whose death they feel partially responsible for have now dedicated their lives to helping the parents of other gay children. Rob and Linda Robertson of Redmond, Washington, learned their son Ryan was gay when he came out to them at just 12-years-old, but the devout Christians lived by the Bible, and as a result did everything they could to tech their son that he could fight his urges. In the end he could not, and Ryan died of a drug overdose when he was just 20-years-old. Gone to soon: Ryan Robertson (above) died of a drug overdose when he was 20 . Guilt: His parents, Linda and Rob Robertson (above), feel partially responsible as they thought Ryan should fight his homosexuality after coming out to them at just 12-year-old . Fighting the urge: Ryan would meet weekly with his pastor and attend reparative therapy in a bid to stop being gay . Now, the Roberstons travel around the country and are dedicated to helping other evangelical parents accept their gay children. While they make it clear they never stopped loving their son, they do regret not accepting him for who he was. They encouraged him to fight his feelings while attending reparative therapy and meetings with his pastor weekly as a teenager. 'Basically, we told our son that he had to choose between Jesus and his sexuality,' said Linda. And while this worked for some time, in the end Ryan could not deny his sexuality. This led to him running off and using drugs when he was just a teenager they say, and going over a year without speaking to either of his parents. 'Suddenly our fear of Ryan someday having a boyfriend (a possibility that honestly terrified me) seemed trivial in contrast to our fear of Ryan’s death, especially in light of his recent rejection of Christianity, and his mounting anger at God,' wrote Linda on her Facebook page. When Ryan came back though after 18 long months, the family did accept him, and his boyfriends, but sadly their time together was short lived. Just 10 months after returning Ryan overdosed after a night out with his old friends. He died after 17 days in the hospital. Memories: Now Linda and Rob travel around the country and are dedicated to helping other evangelical parents accept their gay children . Wise words: 'I grieve, not only for my oldest son, who I will miss every day for the rest of my life, but for the mistakes I made,' wrote Linda on her Facebook . 'Now, when I think back on the fear that governed all my reactions during those first six years after Ryan told us he was gay, I cringe as I realize how foolish I was. I was afraid of all the wrong things,' wrote Linda. 'And I grieve, not only for my oldest son, who I will miss every day for the rest of my life, but for the mistakes I made. I grieve for what could have been, had we been walking by FAITH instead of by FEAR.' Rob and Linda are now leaders of an HIV/AIDS Local Outreach Team, contributors to the website Biola Queer Underground, have started an LGBTQ group at their church, and speak out on behalf of the LGBTQ community around the country.","Rob and Linda Robertson  have devoted their lives to helping Christian parents accept their gay children after losing their gay son to an overdose .

"Cameron has vowed to wield a second veto in Europe if France and Germany insist on pushing ahead with an EU-wide financial transaction tax . David Cameron has vowed to wield a second veto in Europe if France and Germany insist on pushing ahead with an EU-wide financial transaction tax. The Prime Minister said countries calling for a levy were welcome to implement it within their own borders – but added that to impose it across the EU without the backing of other major economies would harm businesses and jobs. The plan to impose a so-called ‘Robin Hood tax’ could cripple the City of London, through which the vast majority of European financial transactions go. Mr Cameron spoke hours before France announced it would try to implement a financial transaction tax of its own, even if EU leaders cannot agree on a tax to cover the whole union. The country’s housing minister Benoist Apparu said yesterday that a bill on the tax – which would only cover France – could be put to parliament as soon as next month. Mr Cameron is entirely happy with the prospect of France going it alone because it would mean their financial sector would be put at a disadvantage to the UK’s. However, Britain would be able to veto an EU-wide tax because it would need the support of all 27 members. Mr Cameron said: ‘If the French themselves want to go ahead with a transactions tax in their own country then they should be free to do so. ‘We actually have stamp duty on share transactions in Britain and yet we have one of the most competitive and successful financial services markets anywhere. ‘But the idea of a new European tax when you are not going to have that tax put in place in other places... I will block it unless the rest of the world all agreed at the same time that we were all going to have some sort of tax.’ French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. France announced it would try to implement a financial transaction tax of its own, even if EU leaders cannot agree on a tax to cover the whole union . The Prime Minister's determination to fall in line with the rest of the world has left him in a trickier position when it comes to IMF contributions, however. After his pledge not to go above a £10billion ceiling, the Financial Times revealed today that he is prepared to give 30bn euros more to help the eurozone if countries such as Japan and China do the same. Mr Cameron tried to play down concerns Britain will end up excluded from decisions affecting the single market under a new treaty being thrashed out in Brussels. The latest draft of a fiscal accord designed to shore up the crisis-hit eurozone specifically talks about ‘deeper integration in the internal market’. It also suggests EU institutions would be involved in policing tough new deficit rules. A bid to apply new rules across the EU was vetoed by the Prime Minister last month – but Britain found itself alone among the 27 member states in opposing the proposal. Britain may end up giving billions of pounds more to the International Monetary Fund to help bail out eurozone countries. After previously refusing to pledge more than the £10bn approved by Parliament in July, David Cameron could be ready to change his position, insiders said. They believe that if countries such as China and Brazil increase their support to the IMF to help it deal with the eurozone crisis, the Prime Minister is likely to follow suit. 'I'd expect the issue of resources to be discussed at the G20 finance ministers' meeting,' Mr Cameron's spokesman told the Financial Times. Britain is already under pressure from the single currency countries to  increase its IMF contributions by 30bn euros. The Prime Minister has so far refused to join the eurozone members who have committed an extra 150bn euros to the IMF to assist Europe. But it now looks possible that he could commit to giving more money on an ad hoc basis, in a move that is bound to infuriate eurosceptic Tory MPs. IMF experts have pointed out that getting assistance from other countries will depend on Europe demonstrating its efforts to prop up its struggling countries. Extra resources would help supplement an IMF war chest of about $348bn, which is currently too small for a major rescue of Spain and Italy. But Mr Cameron could have trouble persuading Parliament to increase Britain's contributions to the IMF. The last time he tried to do so, 30 Conservative MPs joined forces against the proposal with Labour.","'Robin Hood' tax could cripple the City of London .

"Susan Phillips illegally parked in one of 144 reserved yellow spaces at  Castlepoint shopping centre in Bournemouth, Dorset . A councillor has resigned from her role as equality and diversity champion after a rant about disabled parking spaces at a shopping centre was recorded. Susan Phillips said that there should be fewer disabled parking bays as people in wheelchairs ‘aren’t going to walk around’ and use the centre. Conservative Mrs Phillips was recorded making the controversial remarks to an operator as she paid off a £60 fine for parking in a disabled bay. She had illegally parked in one of the 144 reserved yellow spaces at the Castlepoint shopping centre in Bournemouth, Dorset. Although the car park has 2,800 bays in total, the town hall official claimed she spent 45 minutes trying to find a space before parking her Volkswagen Beetle in a disabled bay. When she returned to her car, Mrs Phillips found a parking ticket on her windscreen. In the recorded telephone call she had with an operator with Devere Parking Serices, shesaid: 'I actually feel when you have 12 bays all empty for disabled, and I drove around for three quarters of an hour trying to park and couldn’t, I find that people who are disabled basically, they aren’t going to walk around and I think they have far too many disabled parking bays.' Mrs Phillips stuck to her views and later said: 'I would say disabled people who drive perhaps don’t frequent the likes of Castlepoint because it’s so far to walk everywhere. 'There were 10 or 12 disabled spaces free and I was driving around and around but I know that doesn’t make it OK. Scroll down to hear Susan Phillips' call to parking services .

You do the crime and you pay the bill and I should not have parked there. 'I was very upset about what I’d done, I’ve never parked in a disabled space before.' Helen Dolphin, a spokeswoman for Disabled Motoring UK, said Mrs Phillips’ comments ‘show how little she knows about the needs of disabled people in her area'. She said: 'The fact that they won’t be walking around is probably correct as they will probably be in wheelchairs or mobility scooters.

"Mary Berry, pictured, said people should start preparing for the Christmas dinner by December 1 . Many consider it to be the most emotionally fraught meal of the year. But it doesn’t need to be provided you get ‘that big sheet out’ and start planning on Monday according to Mary Berry. According to the Great British Bake Off star preparations need to be underway for the Christmas Day turkey and trimmings by Monday December 1. The cookbook writer, 79, said the date marks the time that hosts should be getting ‘that big sheet out’ and starting to work out the arrangements for the day. Offering her tips for Christmas, Miss Berry said: ‘Christmas dinner is all about organisation. The more you think about it, the easier it is. It is only a big roast dinner. Monday is December 1 and that is the time to get that big sheet of paper out and start planning and the more you think about it, plan it, it is… it’s only a big roast dinner.’ She added: ‘And not on the back of an envelope mind, a proper big sheet of what you’re going to do – you do your cards by this time, what shopping you can do, what you can do for the freezer, what you can get ready and what is last minute.’ It spells bad news for anyone who thinks they can make do with a quick dash to the supermarket the week before Christmas. Most shops are already selling their festive ranges. And Miss Berry said it’s worth spacing out the shopping and cooking by beginning it weeks in advance. It also helps spreads out the cost according to Miss Berry, whose cookery business empire is thought to be worth as much as £5million. Miss Berry said: ‘You should be making the puddings and cakes now, although not everyone’s like that. Just do as much ahead as you can. Then it’s a nice feeling that it’s done.’ She added: ‘The more you can do ahead the better. I think really you’ve got to find out who’s coming for Christmas, how many there are and even now get in the heavy, the tinned goods. Spin out the costs.’ Ms Berry said when you consider it, Christmas is only a big roast dinner and pretty simple to prepare . Miss Berry also said she precooks her turkey, before driving it to her son’s house for dinner. The only thing she doesn’t start on early is gift-shopping. Speaking at the Specsavers National Book Awards, as she received a lifetime achievement award, Miss Berry said: ‘I wait for my family to give me lists. I have a very gorgeous daughter and daughter-in-law and I say please tell me what you’d like. I don’t do things out of the blue for them, because they know what they want.’ Miss Berry, who is best known as a judge on Great British Bake Off, has written more than seventy cookery books during her 50-year career. She also has product ranges at Lakeland, Sainsbury’s and John Lewis and a line of salad dressings.","Hosts should have a big sheet ready for December 1 to begin planning .

That's what one company is claiming, and they say living in glass homes can improve our overall wellbeing. Of course location would play a part; living in the centre of a busy park might not be as relaxing or quaint as living, say, out among the trees in the English countryside. But the company says that by being exposed to sunlight more regularly, our circadian rhythms work properly and our bodies know how to better regulate themselves. Scroll down for video . Cosy? A London-based company is planning to build transparent homes. The Photon Space project is currently seeking funding for the all-glass houses (artist's illustration shown) The team of architects and scientists used the latest in all-glass technology to come up with The Photon Space, a house made entirely of glass. The multi-layered, high-performance glass walls, bonded to curved glass beams, are fully transparent, which allows natural light to flood in, boosting the health, mood and productivity of those inside, according to the company. The Photon Space has also been designed so it is never too hot or too cold and can be darkened for privacy via smartphone, night or day, using the latest nanotechnology. Earlier this year researchers in New York provided clear physical evidence that sleep fortifies learning. The finding adds to research that a lack of shut eye causes rogue proteins to build up in the eye, increasing the risk for Alzheimer’s disease. Using a microscope, scientists looked inside the brains of mice to see what happened when they were either asleep, or sleep-deprived, after being trained to walk on top of a rotating rod for the first time. They found learning led to the formation of new dendritic spines - tiny structures that project from the end of nerve cells and help pass electric signals from one neuron to another - but only in the mice left to sleep. The study, published in Science, provides the first physical evidence of how sleep helps to consolidate and strengthen new memories. The 485 square-foot (45 square-metre) house, with 360 degree views, includes a living room, double bedroom, kitchen and bathroom, and takes just four weeks to build. The pods will 'retail' for £210,000 ($330,000), with a luxury version available for £260,000 ($410,000). All the homes can be designed according to the request of the customer, however, including the size and shape of the structure. It has also been suggested for use as an office, cafe or base on a safari park, among others, with its steel sub-frame making it suitable for building at most locations. The double-glazed glass panels have apparently a high-performance in insulation and also block adequate amounts of solar radiation: 63 per cent. They also block 99.9 per cent of ultraviolet light, and can keep out 85 per cent of sound. When constructed, the building also touches the ground ‘lightly’ in the words of the team, so it can be removed with little impact on the surroundings. ‘The intention is for The Photon Space to “nest” in the environment and become embedded in the surroundings,’ they write on their website. However they note this will not always be possible, and suggest the structures could also be placed on top of roofs in cities. Quite how much privacy you'd be afforded in such a home, though, might be somewhat called into question. While the walls can be tinted to block out prying eyes, it's unlikely the occupant would want them tinted all the time, considering the purpose of the house is to let in more light. And location would also be key; it almost certainly wouldn't be as fun living at the centre of a busy park as opposed to, say, a nice secluded piece of countryside. Each custom built abode contains a bedroom, kitchen, toilet and lounge. The glass walls can be tinted for privacy or when going to sleep . Each home takes up a space of 485 square-feet (45 square-metres). When and where they will be built has not been revealed, but the company says they could be built on top of roofs . The Photon Space has also been designed so it is never too hot or too cold and can be darkened for privacy, night or day, using the latest nanotechnology . Charlie Sharman, managing director of The Photon Project, said: 'This exciting project combines years of research, glass innovation, engineering and architecture to provide a new way to restore, relax and rejuvenate. 'In our modern lives we spend too much time indoors, despite the fact that scientific research shows that daylight has profound benefits for our health, mood and productivity. 'We have ignored the fact that we still require exposure to natural light for psychological and physiological reasons to stay in tune with our biological clocks and to keep us healthy and happy.'

The design has been supported by the long-term studies by Oxford University's Professor Russell Foster into human's response to natural light. The inventors are now seeking funding through Crowdcube to make the glass houses more widely available. Designer Brent Richards said: 'I have always been fascinated by the opportunity to explore the benefits of glass and harness its capacity to capture light and space.

"It’s every parent’s nightmare – being separated from their child in a busy street or shop, with no way of contacting them. But now there’s a device that young children can wear that lets them call their parents at the touch of a button. LG’s GizmoPal has just one button that allows children to make or receive calls, while concealing GPS technology that lets parents track their child’s whereabouts using a smartphone app. Scroll down for video . LG’s GizmoPal (pictrured in pink and blue) has just one button that allows children to make or receive calls, while concealing GPS technology that lets parents track their child’s whereabouts using a smartphone app . It was originally launched in South Korea as the KizOn but has now been rolled out in the US as GizmoPal. Children over the age of four can call a pre-programmed number by pressing the only large button on the device, which comes in pink and blue. They can receive calls from up to three numbers in the same way and talk into the speaker which is built into a durable rubber band. LG says the smartband is ‘built to withstand the playground’s most ambitious set of monkey bars.’ The device can play fun sound effects and also read out the time for children. Parents with Android phones can receive their child’s anticipated location information automatically at pre-scheduled times by using a feature called ‘Location Check’ so they know if their child is where they should be at different points in the day - for example, when walking home from school (illustrated with a stock image) The wearable has one large button that can be pressed by children to make and receive calls. They talk into a concealed microphone. The device is designed to be worn by children over the age of four and has launched in the US. It claims to be tough enough to be worn while playing sports or in the playground. Children can make a call to one pre-programmed number by pressing the button. All a child has to do is press a button to answer a call, followed by speaking into GizmoPal and listening through its speaker. The wearable works to an app designed to be used on an adult’s smartphone. It lets them check their child’s location using GPS, which is built into the band. It links with an app for iPhones and Android handsets that can be downloaded onto parents’ smartphones, allowing them to set up the wearable and use GPS to track their child’s location at all times. Parents with Android phones can receive their child’s anticipated location information automatically at pre-scheduled times by using a feature called ‘Location Check’ so they know if their child is where they should be at different points in the day. ‘For example, if you know your child normally gets home from school at 3:15pm you can set a reminder for that time and get a notification on your phone so you can check whether your child gets home on time,’ the company says. Despite its simplicity, the GizmoPal costs $80 (£51) and requires a Verizon contract to work which will cost $5 (£3) a month. There is no news as to whether the gadget will come to the UK.","LG’s GizmoPal has one button that allows children to make or receive calls .

"With 100 billion neurons and 37 trillion cells, the human body is simply too complex to be artificially designed by modern computers. But in the quest to create artificial life, what if we started a lot smaller? That’s what team of scientists has done, creating a replica of the simplest form of life we know. The worm Caenorhabditis elegans has just 300 neurons and around 1,000 cells - and now a robot has been created that mimics the actions of this simple organism. Scroll down for video . The OpenWorm team from California is making a 'digital' worm. Their project is recreating the neurons and cells in C. elegans, the simplest organism we know of. By making a digital worm the team hope to create artificial life. They have implanted the digital 'mind' of the worm into a Lego machine (shown) The OpenWorm project, a global effort including researchers from the US and UK, is attempting to create the world’s first digital animal. Earlier this year they ran a successful Kickstarter campaign to fund the creation of a worm you can download onto your computer. The Caenorhabditis elegans nematode is only around 0.04 inches (1mm) in length, is transparent and feeds on bacteria, such as E. coli. It moves around in water at a rate of about 0.04 inches (1mm) per second. Despite being composed of just 1,000 . cells, the creature exhibits relatively advanced behaviour such as . finding a mate and avoiding predators. The . worm has been the focus of huge amounts of research and was the first . multi-celled organism to have its entire genome mapped. And they have also created a robot that mimics the actions of a real-life worm. C. elegans is one of the simplest forms of life we know, thanks to its limited neurons and cells, and thus researchers have been able to accurately map its body. The worm, though simple, contains 80 per cent of the same genes as humans and can be studied as a more basic version of complex life. With a brain, stomach and bodily functions, the worm has provided scientists with a way to study life on a much smaller and more manageable scale. In this latest project the researchers mapped the entire physiology of a C. elegans organism. They then recreated the worm’s brain, cells and more in digital form, complete with neurons ‘firing’ to make decisions. Earlier this year the OpenWorm project ran a successful digital campaign to fund their digital worm (shown). Next year people will be able to buy and download their own worm for use on computers. The artificial creature accurately recreates the cells and neurons in a real C. elegans worm . In a recent comment on futrology site Edge, SpaceX and Tesla Motors chief Elon Musk warned of the dangers of artificial intelligence. In his comment he feared that the risk of ‘something seriously dangerous happening’ could be in as few as five years. Although he doesn’t go into detail, he alludes to ‘digital superintelligences’ and internet bots as being among the potential problems facing humanity. In the comment he says the pace of progress in AI is ‘incredibly fast’. He continued: ‘I am not alone in thinking we should be worried. ‘The leading AI companies have taken great steps to ensure safety. ‘They recognise the danger, but believe that they can shape and control the digital superintelligences and prevent bad ones from escaping into the internet. That remains to be seen…’ The ultimate goal of the project is to give people access to their own digital worm called WormSim to study on their computers through the OpenWorm project. Following the successful Kickstarter campaign, this should be available next year. But they have also inserted the artificial brain of the worm into a Lego machine, specifically a Lego Mindstorms EV3 robot. By recreating the 302 neurons and 959 cells of this tiny nematode worm, the robot can then be left to ‘mimic’ the actions of a real-life worm. This means it moves around, runs into obstacles like walls and also turns. The robot is very basic for now, and does not possess the ability to perform more complex functions such as eating. It’s an important step, though, to creating artificial life that can think for itself. While this worm is a very basic form of life, it may be a precursor to making much more complex animals. This will be a huge undertaking, though - even a mouse has 22 million neurons in its brain. ‘The mere act of trying to put a working model together causes us to realise what we know and what we don't know,’ John Long, a roboticist and neuroscientist at Vassar College in New York State, told New Scientist. The Caenorhabditis elegans nematode (scanning electron microscope image shown) is only around 0.04 inches (1mm) in length, is transparent and feeds on bacteria, such as E. coli. The worm has been the focus of huge amounts of research and was the first multi-celled organism to have its entire genome mapped . Creating an aritifical brain (stock image left) is viewed as being the first step to creating artificial intelligence. Some experts even believe that the key to one day inhabiting far away planets is to get rid of the body altogether, such as how cartoon villain Krang (right), from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, did .","The OpenWorm global project is making a 'digital' worm .

"The end is nigh for Apple's iPhone 5C. Reports claim  the device, which was billed as a low-cost iPhone and was designed to appeal to a wider audience, is to be killed off as early as next summer. Manufacturers will begin winding down production of the handset from January, and are expected to pull the plug completely by the 'middle of 2015.' Reports claim the 2013 iPhone 5C (pictured), which was billed as a low-cost iPhone and was designed to appeal to a wider audience, is to be killed off as early as next summer. Manufacturers will begin winding down production of the handset from January, and are expected to pull the plug completely in the 'middle of 2015' Apple launched its iPhone 5C alongside the high-end iPhone 5S in September 2013. It is similar in size to the 5S, but doesn't t have the Touch ID fingerprint scanner or the A7 processor seen in the more expensive model. Amidst the furore of the iPhone 6 launch in September, Apple silently killed off its Classic iPod. But it wasn't a drop in sales that brought about its demise, according to boss Tim Cook, instead it was blamed on a lack of mechanical parts. Speaking at the WSJD Live conference, Mr Cook said the tech giant no longer had access to the components needs to make the once iconic music player. And although sales for the product had fallen significantly in recent years, sourcing parts was the final nail in the coffin. Mr Cook added the firm could have redesigned the gadget with different parts, but it wouldn't have been cost-effective and would have involved a 'massive' task. It has a plastic case, is available in five different colours, and at launch, prices started at $99 in the US, on a two-year contract, or $549 and £469 when bought outright. The device was also the first Apple phone to be offered in the smaller 8GB model. The report, by Taiwan's Industrial and Commercial times, did not reveal the reasons behind the plans, but Apple has previously been known to discontinue models as they are replaced by newer versions. Sales of the 5C were also poor, compared to the company's expectations, and in January, research firm CIRP reports the model accounted for just 27 per cent of iPhone sales at the end of 2013. It recently killed off its iPod Classic. When Apple’s online store came back online following its iPhone 6 event in September, this later model was missing from the iPod lineup. Apple did not make any formal announcement about ceasing the line at the time. Apple boss Tim Cook later said the firm could have redesigned the gadget with different parts, but it wouldn't have been cost-effective and would have involved a 'massive' task. The report did not reveal the reasons behind the plans, but Apple has previously been known to discontinue models as they are replaced by newer versions. Sales of the 5C (pictured at launch with Apple executive Phil Schiller) were also lower than the company's expectations . Apple is said to be forsaking its iPhone 5C to focus on production of its high-end iPhone 6 range (pictured) 'We couldn't get the parts anymore, not anywhere on Earth,' explained Mr Cook. 'It wasn't a matter of me swinging the axe, saying ""What can I kill today?"" The Classic was the Apple’s first digital music player, and although the original debuted in 2001, there were six generations released up until 2007.

"Police officer Darren Wilson has said he is confident that a federal criminal probe into the shooting of Michael Brown will find 'nothing' and clear him just as a Missouri grand jury did earlier this week. The Justice Department continues to pursue two investigations, one into potential civil rights violations by Officer Wilson when he shot dead 18-year-old unarmed Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and one into the practices of the Ferguson Police force. During his interview with ABC News on Tuesday, Wilson insisted he had never been accused of acting in a racist manner during his law enforcement career. Scroll down for video . Police officer Darren Wilson has said he is confident that a federal criminal probe into the shooting of Michael Brown will find 'nothing' and clear him just as a Missouri grand jury did earlier this week . 'I did my job and followed my training,' Wilson said. 'The training took over.' However, the FBI and the Justice Department are continuing to investigate the shooting for potential civil rights violations by Officer Wilson, and a broader inquiry has been launched into the police practices of the overwhelmingly white Ferguson force, which operates in a predominantly black community. Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement following the conclusion of the grand jury proceeding, that the federal inquiry has always been independent of the one in the St. Louis County, and will remain so. 'While the grand jury proceeding in St. Louis County has concluded, the Justice Department's investigation into the shooting of Michael Brown remains ongoing,' Attorney General Eric Holder , 63, said. It's not over: Federal investigations into the shooting of Michael Brown will continue despite grand jury decision, Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement after Monday's grand jury verdict . 'In addition, the Department continues to investigate allegations of unconstitutional policing patterns or practices by the Ferguson Police Department.' Wilson, speaking to ABC News' George Stephanopoulos on Tuesday, admitted that he's worried about there being a federal criminal investigation, but is confident investigators will find 'nothing' to suggest he broke the law. 'I stand by what I did,' he said. 'I stand by my training, and just have to wait and see what they determine.' Stephanopoulos asked Wilson: 'You're confident that no charges will be brought?' Wilson responded, 'Yeah.' To win a criminal conviction on civil rights charges, federal prosecutors would need to prove that Wilson intended to violate Brown's rights when he shot and killed him on August 9. 'The bar is very high,' said Jennifer Laurin, a University of Texas law professor. She added, though, that federal prosecutors do not always see things the way local prosecutors do. The Justice Department are investigating whether it can be shown that Officer Wilson (right) willfully deprived 18-year-old Michael Brown (left) of his civil rights when he shot him several times while he was unarmed . Without a criminal indictment, Brown's family might have no better legal recourse than to sue local authorities over the teenager's fatal shooting. After a St. Louis County grand jury decided on Monday not to indict officer Wilson - and given the high bar to a federal criminal prosecution - the family may follow the path of other high-profile U.S. police shootings and file a civil lawsuit for wrongful death or civil rights violations. In some such cases, the authorities who oversee police departments agree to settle for millions of dollars. 'There might be a lot of political forces that would be at work that would give the Brown family a chance at a quick settlement,' said New York lawyer and former prosecutor Paul Callan. During his interview with ABC News on Tuesday, Wilson insisted he had never been accused of acting in a racist manner during his law enforcement career . The burden of proof in a U.S. civil suit is lower than in a criminal case. A plaintiff needs to show liability only by the preponderance of the evidence, not beyond a reasonable doubt. In recent years, New York City agreed to pay $7.15 million to the family and friends of Sean Bell; Chicago agreed to a $4.1 million settlement with the family of Flint Farmer; and a California transit agency said it would pay $2.8 million to the family of Oscar Grant, according to news reports at the time. All three men were shot to death by police officers in cases that drew widespread attention but not murder convictions. Rodney King sued Los Angeles after his videotaped 1991 beating by police, and a jury awarded him $3.8 million. 'There are so few cases in which officers are criminally charged, but plenty of instances in which very successful civil rights cases are brought,' said Joanna Schwartz, a UCLA law professor. Violence: Police gathered on the streets of Ferguson on Monday as protesters reacted after the announcement of the grand jury decision not to indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson in the death of Michael Brown . Daryl Parks, a lawyer for the Brown family, said on CNN on Tuesday that the family was focused on the Justice Department investigation, not getting money from the city, but would explore legal options including a wrongful death lawsuit. 'That will have its day,' he said. Ferguson Assistant City Manager Pam Hylton declined to comment on any possible suit. If the family brought a civil lawsuit, a jury would essentially be asked to determine whether Wilson acted 'reasonably' when he shot Brown, Schwartz said. And although the grand jury appears to have accepted Wilson's self-defense claims, that does not necessarily mean a trial jury would do so in a civil lawsuit, said Peter Joy, a law professor and director of the criminal justice clinic at Washington University in St. Louis. The deadline to file a lawsuit would be two to five years, depending on the type of claim and whether it was under state or federal law, said St. Louis lawyer Stephen Ryals. The Justice Department continues to pursue two investigations, one into potential civil rights violations by Officer Darren Wilson when he shot Michael Brown and one into the practices of the Ferguson Police force . Brown's family members could sue Wilson and city officials on behalf of either themselves, Brown's estate, or both. The suit could seek compensation for economic damages such as lost future income and funeral and burial expenses, as well as punitive damages, according to similar suits in past cases. The family could sue based on wrongful death or deprivation of civil rights, said Callan, who represented the estate of Nicole Brown Simpson in a wrongful death lawsuit against former athlete O.J. Simpson. After a jury acquitted Simpson of murder, a civil jury in 1997 found him liable for the deaths of his former wife and her friend Ronald Goldman and ordered Simpson to pay $33.5 million in damages to the victims' families. A claim on either theory would be difficult to win, Callan said, because of conflicting witness accounts and physical evidence Wilson acted in self-defense. What other investigations are underway? The FBI and the Justice Department are continuing to investigate the shooting for potential civil rights violations. Investigators would need to satisfy a rigorous standard of proof in order to mount a prosecution. Whereas the county grand jury could consider multiple charges, Justice Department lawyers have a single focus: whether it can be shown that Wilson willfully deprived Brown of his civil rights. That is a difficult burden to meet, especially considering the wide latitude given to police officers in using deadly force. Some other past high-profile police shootings, including the 1999 killing of Amadou Diallo in New York City, did not result in federal prosecutions. What about broader allegations of racial insensitivity on the part of the Ferguson police department? Beyond the shooting itself, the Justice Department is conducting a wide-reaching investigation into the practices of the entire department. That investigation is focusing on stops, searches and arrests and generally looking for patterns of discrimination within the overwhelmingly white department. It has the potential to require major changes in the policing methods of the Ferguson force. Such broader reviews typically rely on data and interviews in the community and can take far longer than a criminal investigation. The Justice Department has initiated roughly 20 investigations of troubled police departments in the past five years, or more than twice the number undertaken in the five years before that. And regardless of the outcome of the criminal investigation, there's also the potential that Brown's family could file a wrongful-death lawsuit against Wilson. How long might these other investigations go on? The Justice Department has not set a timeline for either investigation, though outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder has said he expects the federal investigation into the shooting to be concluded before he leaves office. He said late on Monday that that investigation was independent of the local probe, and that 'we have avoided prejudging any of the evidence.' How will authorities deal with any protests? President Barack Obama appealed for calm and understanding Monday after the no-indictment announcement, saying the country needed 'to accept that this decision was the grand jury's to make.' Holder, too, said the decision should not lead to violence. Even so, within minutes of the announcement, crowds in the streets of Ferguson shattered windows, vandalized cars and taunted police while officers released smoke and pepper spray to disperse the gatherings. In anticipation of the protests, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon pre-emptively declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard. Gun sales surged before the grand jury decision and some shop owners boarded up their stores. A federal law enforcement team has been working with top commanders in Ferguson and from neighboring police departments to help reduce tensions and build trust. Are there longer-term efforts to deal with underlying problems? Nixon several days ago named 16 members to a panel aimed at helping the community heal after the shooting. The commission, which will study underlying social and economic conditions, is expected to make recommendations in a report due by September 2015.","Officer Wilson said the investigation into whether he carried out a potential civil rights violation will find 'nothing'

"Sir Ridley Scott has found himself embroiled in a race row after his latest film was branded ‘too white’. Twitter users are urging a boycott of Exodus: Gods and Kings, which tells the story of Moses, calling it ‘offensive’ and ‘unacceptable’ that white actors are playing the roles of Egyptians. Sir Ridley, who made his name as a director with Alien and has been Oscar-nominated three times, defended his casting by claiming he would not have been able to finance its £90million budget if he had hired unknown Egyptian actors instead of established Hollywood stars. Scroll down for video . Hollywood’s forthcoming Moses movie - Exodus: Gods and Kings - isn't in cinemas yet but that hasn't stopped it coming in for renewed criticism, this time over the decision to cast white actors as Egyptians . Scott has been bullish about the issue of casting and recently told Variety that it was a business decision to hire white actors . The title role is played by Christian Bale, which one Twitter user said was ‘akin to casting George Clooney to play Malcolm X’. The film, which opens on Boxing Day, also features Sigourney Weaver, Australian Joel Edgerton and Aaron Paul, who is best known for his role as Jessie in the hit television series Breaking Bad. While a number of ethnic minority actors have also been cast, including Sir Ben Kingsley, the majority of the non-white performers are in background roles, often even playing slaves or criminals. But this has done little to placate the critics. One Twitter user said: ‘I’ll be boycotting Exodus and so should everyone else to tell Hollywood that whitewashing is sick and unacceptable’, while another called the casting of Oscar-winner Bale as ‘offensive’. On Twitter, the hashtag #boycottexodusmovie has been trending, with posters expressing their anger over the casting decisions . People have been using Twitter to call for a boycott of the movie based on the fact that all the leads are played by white actors . Another said: ‘Blacks only cast as slaves, thieves ... Not the kings and queens? I hope Exodus bombs at the box office’. Sir Ridley defended the casting in an interview with Variety magazine. ‘I can’t mount a film of this budget and say that my lead actor is Mohammad so-and-so from such-and-such,’ he said. ‘I’m just not going to get it financed. So the question doesn’t even come up.’ Holy Moses! Bale’s controversial comments weren't well received by Christian writers and bloggers who fear the film is tampering too much with the original Biblical text . Exodus: Of Gods and Kings, out in December 12, tells the story of Moses rising up against the Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses and taking 600,000 slaves on a monumental journey of escape from Egypt . He had previously tried to placate his critics by promising that the film would show ‘a confluence of cultures’. He added: ‘There are many theories about the ethnicity of the Egyptian people and we had a lot of discussions about how to best represent the culture. ‘We cast major actors from different ethnicities to reflect the diversity of culture, from Iranians to Spaniards to Arabs.’ This is not the first time Exodus has found itself mired in controversy. Bale was criticised for comments he made in September, when he described Moses as ‘schizophrenic’ and ‘barbaric’.","The hashtag #boycottexodusmovie has been trending on Twitter as posters express there anger over the film's casting of white actors as Egyptians .

"Capturing moving objects with a normal camera usually leads to disappointment, especially if the object is travelling fast. But now there’s a gadget for amateur photographers that allows them to take professional-looking motion photos. The Vela One uses strobe lights to capture fleeting moments and its abilities have been showcased  in a series of photographs showing ball bearings smashing into fruit, sweets, biscuits and light bulbs, among other objects. Scroll down for video . The ability of the strobe light camera attachment called Vela One to capture fleeting moments has been shown off in a series of photographs showing ball bearings smashing into fruit, biscuits and sweets. A shower of sugar can be seen coming from this lollipop . The shots show the moments after impact - the showering of crumbs, sugar and glass, splitting skins and jets of juice. Previously, such clarity could only be achieved through the use of expensive, high-voltage systems, but Vela Labs, the firm behind the light, claims it enables amateur photographers to take high speed photographs with a basic DSLR camera. The Vela One rig captures moments that last just two millionths of a second and costs from £495, putting it within reach of amateur photographers.

Previously, pictures like this, showing a Christmas bauble exploding after being shot with a BB pellet, could only be achieved through the use of expensive, high-voltage systems, but Vela Labs, the firm behind the light, claims it enables amateur photographers to take high speed photographs with a basic DSLR camera . ‘If you splat a grape at two millionths of a second, you can see the way that it uncurls the skin around it.’ The 35-year-old explained that a super-fast flash is needed to capture such moments, because there is no shutter speed fast enough to snap a bullet or any other object travelling at a similar speed. ‘A normal bullet will travel seven metres in a millisecond, so there is normally no way you can take a photo of a bullet because it will just appear blurred,’ he said. ‘The way that we do it is by using a slower shutter speed and a faster flash which simply freezes the image of a bullet in mid-air. ‘The Vela One is a hundred times faster than any normal flash that you can buy on the market and means that amateur photographers can take photos of things that are going three times the speed of sound.’ Vela Labs' founder, Matthew Kane, said: ‘The Vela One (pictured) is a hundred times faster than any normal flash that you can buy on the market and means that amateur photographers can take photos of things that are going three times the speed of sound’ Mr Kane is raising money for the light on Kickstarter and says he has already received interest from distributors in the USA, Canada and South Korea for his camera, which can capture moments in time like this - a biscuit being shot by a BB pellet . He has only photographed air bullets so far, but says: ‘I can guarantee that it can capture real bullets because I've accurately measured the speed of the flash.’ Mr Kane is raising money for the light on Kickstarter and says he has already received interest from distributors in the USA, Canada and South Korea. ‘This product will cost the same as a new lens for your camera and will mean that you will be able to take beautiful photos that very few people have been able to take before,’ he said. ‘The current technology used for this kind of photography is based around high-voltage lighting. Using such equipment is incredibly dangerous. People can get killed. ‘I'm excited to see what kind of pictures people are going to come up with. I think that people are going to come up with amazing things.’ The Vela One Kickstarter campaign has over £16,000 of its £25,000 target just one day after opening, with some ‘early bird’ offers already sold out. The rig can be pre-ordered from £495 and is estimated to be ready to be shipped in May 2015. Mr Kane said of his rig: ‘This product will cost the same as a new lens for your camera and will mean that you will be able to take beautiful photos that very few people have been able to take before,’ like this tomato spraying juice after being shot . ‘I'm excited to see what kind of pictures people are going to come up with.

"While the majority of smartwatches focus on bright LCD displays, Sony is said to be taking inspiration from the Kindle for its next wearable device. Sources ‘familiar with the plans’ told Bloomberg the Japanese tech giant is developing a smartwatch covered in e-ink material. This means it could transform its appearance at the touch of a button, while using significantly less battery than some of its rivals. Sources ‘familiar with the plans’ told Bloomberg that Sony is developing a smartwatch covered in e-ink material. This means it could transform its appearance at the touch of a button, while using less than its rivals. Pebble's watch that launched via Kickstarter in 2012 is pictured . For example, a wallpaper could be applied to turn the strap and display into a certain design, or notifications could be shown on the strap. The report did not reveal any more details about the watch, nor what it will look like, but Sony is said to be focusing more on style over substance. When it’s released, which is scheduled to be next year, the watch is also likely to have fewer specifications than its rivals. The concept is reported as being one of the first products to be developed since Sony’s boss Kazuo Hirai took over the firm’s product strategy division. E-ink lacks colour and video, but as a result, uses much less energy than traditional LCD displays. It gets its name because it resembles the text and colour scheme of newspapers and books, which is why it's popular for e-readers, such as Amazon's Kindle (pictured) Cambridge-based Plastic Logic works with e-paper on a number of its products, including the popSlate phone case concept unveiled last year (pictured).

"Turtles may look like the hard-shelled relatives of lizards and snakes, but their DNA suggests they have far more in common with birds. This is according to US scientists who used a new genetic sequencing technique called Ultra Conserved Elements (UCE) to finally settle the debate on turtle evolution. The results, they say, reveal that turtles belong to a large group called 'Archelosauria,' along with their relatives birds, crocodiles and dinosaurs. Turtles may look like the hard-shelled relatives of lizards and snakes, but their DNA suggests they have far more in common with birds . Scientists at the California Academy of Sciences suspect the new group will be the largest group of vertebrates to ever receive a new scientific name. Their 'tree of life' is consistent with the time and space patterns in which turtle species appear in the fossil record, highlighting the accuracy of the method. 'Dinos, including birds, and crocodilians are Archosauria. Turtles are called chelonians,' Dr James Parham, a co-author told MailOnline. 'Hence the new name we coined for the group that includes turtles, dinosaurs and crocodilians: Archelosauria.' Although UCE has been available for two years, this is the first time the scientists have used the tool to genetically map vertebrates and how they are related. It works by analysing parts of the genome that are highly conserved between different species. Scientists at the California Academy of Sciences suspect the new group - which includes birds, dinosaurs and turtles - will be the largest group of vertebrates to ever receive a new scientific name . The findings also resolve an evolutionary mystery surrounding soft-shell turtles (pictured)- a bizarre group of scale-less turtles with snorkel-like snouts. Until now, studies linked softshell turtles with a smaller semi-aquatic group called mud turtles . Researchers have long argued over how the turtle got its shell - and a fossil last year finally revealed the 'missing link'. The oldest known fossil turtle dated back about 210 million years, but it had an already fully formed shell, giving no clues to early shell evolution. Last year, researchers revealed that Eunotosaurus africanus, a South African species that existed 260 million years ago, has large broadened ribs that researchers believe eventually formed a shell. The researchers say the first clue came in 2008 when the 220 million-year-old fossil remains of an early turtle species, Odontochelys semitestacea, were discovered in China. It had a fully developed plastron (the belly portion of a turtle's shell), but only a partial carapace made up of distinctively broadened ribs and vertebrae on its back. With this knowledge the scientists turned to newly discovered specimens of Eunotosaurus africanus, a South African species 40 million years older than O. semitestacea that also had distinctively broadened ribs. Their detailed study of Eunotosaurus suggests it represents one of the first species to form the evolutionary branch of turtles. 'Calling this is an exciting new era of sequencing technology is an understatement,' says Brian Simison, PhD, Director of the Academy's Center for Comparative Genomics (CCG). 'In the space of just five years, reasonably affordable studies using DNA sequencing have advanced from using only a handful of genetic markers to more than 2,000 - an unbelievable amount of DNA. 'New techniques like UCE dramatically improve our ability to help resolve decades-long evolutionary mysteries, giving us a clear picture of how animals like turtles evolved on our constantly-changing planet.' The findings also resolve an evolutionary mystery surrounding soft-shell turtles - a bizarre group of scale-less turtles with snorkel-like snouts. Until now, studies linked softshell turtles with a smaller semi-aquatic group called mud turtles, despite the fact that softshells appear in the fossil record long before their mud-loving counterparts. The Academy's study places softshells in a league of their own on the evolutionary tree, quite far removed from any turtle relatives. Their long independent history helps explain their striking looks as well as their ancient presence in the fossil record. With large amounts of data backing up each evolutionary branch on the turtle tree of life, scientists are able to compare their evolution not only across species, but also across each continent's corresponding fossil records. 'I have been working on the evolutionary relationships of turtles for over 20 years using a variety of methods,' said co-author Dr Parham. 'Fossils are essential for showing us what extinct turtles looked like, but also in letting us know when and where they lived in the past.' The results reveal that turtles belong to a large group called 'Archelosauria,' along with their relatives birds, crocodiles and dinosaurs, such as T.Rex (pictured)","Scientists used a new genetic sequencing technique to map relatives .

"The release of Apple’s iPhone 6 Plus means there is now only a 2.4-inch difference between the size of the phablet’s screen, and the display on its iPad mini. And figures suggest this similarity could cause serious problems for Apple’s tablet range. Analysis has revealed that as phones become larger, more people use them for watching videos or reading - making their tablets almost redundant. In fact, the research found that people who recently upgraded to an iPhone 6 Plus use their tablets 36 per cent less than before. Pocket studied more than two million articles and videos opened using its app, and compared the before-and-after behaviour of iPhone and iPad users. People with an iPhone 5S use their phone 55% of the time, but this increases to 72% for the iPhone 6 and 80% for the iPhone 6 Plus - both at the detriment of the iPad . The research was carried out by Pocket - an app that lets users save webpages, videos and other content for reading later. It analysed more than two million articles and videos that were opened using the app, and compared the before and after behaviour in people who previously owned an iPhone 5, 5C and 5S and those who now own an iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. It also looked at the use of tablets by the same people. ‘The bigger your phone’s screen, the more time you’ll spend reading and watching on it,’ explained the researchers in a blog post. ‘In fact, the bigger your phone’s screen, the more you’ll read and watch as a whole.’ It discovered that users who upgraded to an iPhone 6 now view content on their phones 72 per cent of the time, up from 55 per cent when they owned on a smaller screen. Pocket also saw users with both an iPhone and an iPad watched significantly more content as soon as they upgraded to an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus. Those with the iPhone 6 (centre) opened 33% more articles and videos inside Pocket than they did with a 5S (left), and those with a 6 Plus (right) opened 65% more items than before . Users with an iPhone 6 now read on their tablets (iPad Air and iPad mini pictured) 19 per cent less during the week, and 27 per cent less over the weekend. While those with an iPhone 6 Plus are on their tablets 31 per cent less during the week, and 36 per cent less over the weekend . And iPhone 6 Plus consume content on their phones 80 per cent of the time - the same ratio of phone to tablet reading as seen on Android. Pocket also saw that users with both an iPhone and an iPad watched significantly more content as soon as they upgraded to an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus. The iPhone 6 accounted for 68 per cent of all sales through September and into early October, while its larger model took between 23 and 24 per cent. Apple's cheaper iPhone 5S and 5C handsets made up the rest of the sales. Following last year's launch, the 5S and 5C accounted for 84 per cent of total iPhone sales in the first 30 days - proving the 6 range is more popular. The skew is being blamed on reports that stocks of the iPhone 6 Plus are lower because Apple is struggling to complete orders. Recent figures from Pocket also found that two-and-a-half more Pocket users are opting for an iPhone 6 as opposed to a 6 Plus. Those with the iPhone 6 now open 33 per cent more articles and videos inside Pocket than they did with a 5 or 5S, and those with the 6 Plus open 65 per cent more items than they did with a smaller phone. Users with an iPhone 6 now read on their tablets 19 per cent less during the week, and 27 per cent less over the weekend. While those with a 6 Plus are on their tablets 31 per cent less during the week and 36 per cent less over the weekend. ‘That being said, there remains one place where tablets still hold reign: your nightstand,’ added the researchers. ‘Regardless of which iPhone they have, users still reach for their iPads around 9pm for some late-night, bedtime reading.’ But, a larger screen does make it less portable and Pocket noticed that people with an iPhone 6 Plus read 22 per cent less on their morning commutes than those with a smaller model. Recent figures from Pocket also found that two-and-a-half more Pocket users are opting for an iPhone 6 as opposed to a 6 Plus. ‘This tells us that, at least for now, convenience and portability trump a better, and bigger, entertainment and reading experience.’","Pocket app lets users save pages, videos and other content to read later .

Eliana Amaral, from Pernambuco in north Brazil, was awarded second place while bringing up the rear was Jessica Amaral from the central northern region of Para who came third. Ms Macedo, an administration student, had been embroiled in controversy leading up the event when she suggested on social media that the result would be fixed to give the title to rival Mari Sousa. The contest was plunged into further chaos when rivals accused Ms Sousa, 25, and Ms Amaral, 24, of paying thousands of pounds to the event's judging panel for the right to come first and second. Brazil's O Dia newspaper reported that Ms Amaral, a law student representing the northeastern state of Pernambuco, had allegedly paid organisers around £18,000 for second place.

"The University of Massachusetts-Amherst has cut ties with alumnus Bill Cosby amid allegations by women accusing him of sexual assault. A university spokesman told the Boston Globe on Wednesday university officials had asked Cosby to step down as an honorary co-chairman of their $300 million fundraising campaign and Cosby agreed. Cosby received a master's degree and a doctorate in education from the university. He and his wife donated several hundred thousand dollars to the university, with reports suggesting the figure to be about $500,000. Dropped: The University of Massachusetts Amherst has confirmed it cut ties with 1976 graduate Bill Cosby in the wake of his ever-growing sex scandal . Flashback: Cosby shakes hands with University of Massachusetts Chancellor Randolph W. Bromery (left) after receiving his Doctor of Education degree in 1977 . Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley sent a letter to the university urging it to cut ties with Cosby. Coakley says while Cosby hadn't been criminally charged his association sends the wrong message when the state is focused on the prevention of campus sexual assault. 'Although Mr. Cosby has not been criminally charged nor convicted for these actions ... I believe the volume and disturbing nature of these allegations has reached a point where Mr. Cosby should no longer have a formal role at UMass, nor be involved in its fundraising efforts, unless or until Mr. Cosby is able to satisfactorily respond to these allegations,' Coakley wrote. Cosby's lawyer has called the allegations 'unsubstantiated' and 'discredited'. On Wednesday it was revealed that Cosby  testified under oath in 2005 that he gave the National Enquirer an exclusive interview about looming sexual-assault accusations by a Canadian woman against him in exchange for the tabloid spiking a second accuser's story. Excerpts of Cosby's deposition from a civil lawsuit filed by Andrea Constand quote Cosby as saying he feared the public would believe her sexual-assault accusations if the Enquirer published similar claims by Beth Ferrier. Both women accused Cosby of drugging and molesting them. 'Did you ever think that if Beth Ferrier's story was printed in the National Enquirer, that that would make the public believe that maybe Andrea was also telling the truth?' Cosby was asked. 'Exactly,' Cosby replied, according to court motions initially filed under seal and made available from archived federal court records. Cosby, in the deposition, said he had a contract with the Enquirer. 'I would give them an exclusive story, my words,' Cosby said in the Sept. 29, 2005, deposition. In return, 'they would not print the story of — print Beth's story.' Role model no more: Flanked by Boston College President Reverend J. Donald Monan (right) and UMass President William M. Bulger, actor Bill Cosby reacts to the graduates at Boston College commencement exercises in 2011. UMass cut all ties with Cosby this week . The release of the documents comes after Cosby this month was shown on an Associated Press video trying to persuade the news cooperative not to use his response when asked this month about sexual-abuse allegations. 'I would appreciate if it was scuttled,' Cosby said in a videotaped exchange with the AP on Nov. 6. Cosby said in 2005 he had been given a draft of Ferrier's interview with the Enquirer and was told she had passed its lie-detector test. He said he also was given an advance look at his exclusive, titled 'My Story,' which warned that he would defend against anyone trying to 'exploit' him. Constand later sued Cosby and the Enquirer, alleging defamation. The claims were consolidated with her sexual-assault lawsuit against Cosby and were settled. A representative for American Media, Inc., which owns the National Enquirer, said in an emailed statement Wednesday that the Enquirer was 'unflinching' in its coverage of the allegations against Cosby. 'We continue to remain aggressive in our reporting today and stand by the integrity of our coverage of this story which we have taken the lead on for more than a decade,' the representative said. Cosby had said at his deposition that Constand and her mother asked only for an apology in early phone calls about the issue in January 2005, and he said they received one. 'Andrea's mother said, 'That's all I wanted, Bill,'' Cosby testified. Constand's lawyers argued in their defamation suit: 'Requesting only an apology is not the action of an extortionist or someone who wants to 'exploit' a celebrity.' They said that Cosby later called back and offered to pay for Constand's 'education.' Constand had met Cosby through her job with the women's basketball team at Temple University in Philadelphia, and she said he sexually assaulted her at his nearby home in 2004. Happily married: Cosby has been with his wife Camille for the last 51 years . She quit the job and moved home that year, and she first filed a report with Ontario police on Jan. 13, 2005, and filed a federal civil suit that March. After prosecutors near Philadelphia decided not to file criminal charges, several other women came forward to support Constand's claims, including Ferrier. Ferrier has gone public about what she called her brief affair with Cosby when she was a model in 1984. She said that he once drugged her coffee during an encounter in Denver and that she woke up hours later in the backseat of her car with her clothes disheveled. The Enquirer in 2005 withheld her story and instead published Cosby's account, in which he said, 'Sometimes you try to help people and it backfires on you and then they try to take advantage of you.' In the legal deposition, taken at a Philadelphia hotel, Constand's lawyer asked Cosby if he tried in the Enquirer article 'to make the public believe that Andrea was not telling the truth?' 'Yes,' Cosby replied. Constand's civil lawsuit grew to include nine women willing to testify about allegations of sexual assaults involving Cosby. Some came forward after a suburban Philadelphia prosecutor declined to file criminal charges over Constand's police complaint. A comedian this year referenced the accusations anew in a performance, prompting some of the suit's Jane Doe witnesses to reveal their names and other women to raise new accusations. Cosby has refused to discuss allegations raised in recent weeks by numerous women.","Cosby received a master's and a doctorate in education at UMass .

"Humans in Africa were harvesting and eating cereals 7,000 years ago - several centuries earlier than previously thought. The discovery was made after researchers found ancient barley and wheat residues on teeth of skeletons from two Neolithic cemeteries in Central Sudan and Nubia. It is believed wheat was first cultivated in the Middle East about 10,500 years ago and spread out from there to Central and South Asia as well as to Europe and North Africa - the latter faster than expected. Humans in Africa were harvesting and eating cereals 7,000 years ago - several centuries earlier than previously thought. Pictured is one of the graves at the Neolithic cemetery in Nubia (Sudan), containing a skeleton and plant material deposited behind the skull (white structure at the left of the image) 'With our results we can verify that people along the Nile did not only exploit gathered wild plants and animals, but even crops of barley and wheat,' said Dr Welmoed Out from Kiel University. 'The diversity of the diet was much greater than previously assumed,' he added. 'The fact that grains were placed in the graves of the deceased implies that they had a special, symbolic meaning.' Mineral plant particles, dubbed phytoliths, survive over thousands of years, even when other plant remains have been destroyed. Plant particles found during the excavation of this Neolithic cemetery in Nubia (Sudan) turned out to be traces of domestic cereals when analysed in a lab . The skeleton of an young woman who lived in Tuscany 2,000 years ago shows that coeliac disease existed far longer than thought. The woman's remains were found in an ancient tomb at the Cosa archaeological site on the Tuscan coast in Italy. Researcher said the woman was affluent - and even tried to eat a paleo diet to deal with her problem. The skeleton of the woman showed signs of malnutrition and osteoporosis. Both can be complications of untreated coeliac disease, which is characterised by a severe allergic reaction to gluten in the intestinal lining. Many of the woman's bones were eroded at the tips, and she would have stood just 140 centimetres (4 feet, 7 inches) tall. After discovering these particles, the research team used, among other things, a special high-quality light microscope as well as radiocarbon analysis to determine their age. 'The finds reveal new information on the diet of these human groups, indicating a diverse intake of grains, cereals, various millets and legumes,' explained the researchers. '[The area] is dominated by domestic Near East cereals and provides rare evidence of the cultivation of crop plants in a society whose economy has been considered mainly pastoral.' They added that the cemetery also provides the first evidence in Africa for the use of the near-eastern wheat and barley crop use. The study follows separate research, earlier this year, which found that ancient Egyptians ate a diet composed largely of vegetables, fruit, wheat and barley. A team of researchers from the University of Lyon studied carbon atoms in 45 mummies of people that lived in Egypt between 3,500BC and 600AD. They found that they ate a lot of barley and wheat over the long period, suggesting that they adapted to the region incredibly well. The finding also echoes many paintings in Egyptian tombs that show people working the land and harvesting wheat to make loaves of bread, which are often offered to the god of the afterlife, Osiris. The discovery was made after researchers found ancient wheat (left) and barley (right) residues on teeth of skeletons from two Neolithic cemeteries in Central Sudan and Nubia .

"A 2-year-old Belgian Malinois was supposed to be the ninth member of the police force in the Oregon coastal town of Cannon Beach, but Cash just didn't have what it takes. The dog was dismissed from the force before seeing any action or gaining any glory. Cash was skittish, afraid of heights and had a barking problem. Noises would scare him. When he had to jump onto counters in search of drugs, he showed too much resistance. Cash, a 2-year-old Belgian Malinois, was supposed to be the ninth member of the police force in the Oregon coastal town of Cannon Beach, but according to officers he just doesn't have what it takes . He would often bark aggressively rather than go straight to the drugs. Barking is 'fine as an alert, but you can't get anything done when you're trying to get him to find dope and he's just barking in your face,' said Officer Josh Gregory, the dog's former handler, told the Daily Astorian.

The department acquired Cash after raising $27,000 for the K-9 officer program earlier this year. Gregory and the Washington County trainer tried to train Cash for four weeks, between September and October, before giving up on him.

The driver might have hit the gas instead of the brake, police said, causing his minivan to lurch out of the parking space and onto the walkway where Guthrie sat. Witnesses tried to get the driver to back up after the accident, but he didn't seem to understand what happened - possibly because he couldn't see Guthrie pinned behind the car, said police Commander RaShall Brackney. 'He appeared to be disoriented at that point in time and confused as to the directions they were giving him,' Brackney said on Wednesday.

"Pope Francis has been sneaking out of the Vatican at night to give money to the poor on the streets of Rome, it has today been claimed.

He said Pope Francis  - who as archbishop of Buenos Aires went out at night to visit the needy - had often expressed a desire to accompany him on his nocturnal missions.

While he simply said: 'Next question please', it . has been taken by many as an admission of the Holy Father's secret trips out . into the night to give alms. The Huffington Post reports that a Vatican source said: 'Swiss guards confirmed that the pope has ventured out at night, dressed as a regular priest, to meet with homeless men and women.'

"Much discussed and a source of endless gossip, The Archers Christmas pantomime has always been a highlight of the Ambridge calendar. So, when this year’s production was cancelled due to poor attendance at auditions, it left loyal listeners aghast. However, rather than admit defeat, the fictional village’s director, Lynda Snell, has rallied her cast to put on a production of Noel Coward’s play Blithe Spirit. Radio play: The Archers Christmas pantomime has always been a highlight of the Ambridge calendar . The 90-minute show, broadcast on Boxing Day, will fit into the series as a whole, with episodes before and after seamlessly running into and out of the play. However, Jeremy Howe, Radio 4’s commissioning editor for drama, said the production can also stand alone in its own right. He commented: ‘It will be a straight production of one of the great comedies of the English stage’. This is the first time there has been such a change in the programme’s format in its nearly 64-year history. Stage performance: Blithe Spirit recently saw a West End production led by Angela Lansbury (above) Mr Howe added: ‘The whole thing is very nicely dovetailed together. You have an Archers Christmas episode and then the Boxing Day episode is Blithe Spirit - it’s integrated into the programme, but Blithe Spirit should also stand alone as a rollicking good production. Jeremy Howe, Radio 4’s commissioning editor for drama, said the production can also stand alone . ‘Every year Lynda Snell puts on a pantomime and every year we never go to the pantomime - which is probably a good thing, I think - but we hear all the backstage gossip. 'She is the most tyrant producer in the history of tyrant producers, which is entertaining in itself - and all the stories around that is all good comedy for the Archers. ‘But this year the panto collapsed and she is putting on her own production of Blithe Spirit, with the cast of the Archers. ‘There’s a word of warning here that all the backstage shenanigans are as entertaining as ever but it will actually be a very good production of Blithe Spirit’. Blithe Spirit, which recently saw a West End production led by Angela Lansbury, tells the story of socialite and novelist Charles Condomine, who conducts a séance in his house, hoping to gather material for his next book. However, the scheme backfires when he is haunted by the ghost of his first wife. The parts will be played by the normal actors of The Archers, who will also remain as their Ambridge characters during this play within a play. On top of the long-running programme’s usual cast, actor Julian Ryan Tutt, most famous for sitcom Green Wing will be playing a role. However, Mr Howe would not comment on why the actor had been called in or whether he will be playing a larger role in The Archers.","Fans will enjoy full-length production of Noel Coward’s Blithe Spirit .

And yesterday experts warned the assault could soon impact on banking and personal email accounts. Today Egypt's coastguard caught three divers cutting through an undersea Internet cable on Wednesday, the army said, the first suggestion criminals might be involved in days of severed connections and disruptions online. A patrol stopped a fishing boat near the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria and arrested three divers, the army spokesman said on his official Facebook page. He did not give details of the divers' possible motive in severing the link he said belonged to Egypt Telecom, the country's monopoly landline provider. DDOS - distributed denial of service - is the technical name for cyber attacks that overwhelm computers and make websites disappear. They are potentially devastating for businesses and their reputations. The first DDoS attacks occurred in the late 1990s. They are launched by competitors, extortionists and so-called politically motivated 'hacktivists'. A cyber attacker floods a network connection with tens of gigabits of traffic. This creates bottlenecks in firewalls, routers and the connection itself . Then, when the next request for service tries to come or go, the network connection is clogged and communication stops. Another scenario sees an attacker flood a target with hundreds of thousands of requests per second, then when the server attempts to process them it shuts down. In recent weeks, the attackers have launched a more sinister and potentially devastating offensive. They have launched a strike that hits the Internet’s core infrastructure, the Domain Name System, or DNS, which functions like a telephone switchboard. It translates the names of websites like Facebook.com or Google.com into a string of numbers that the Internet’s technology can understand, with millions of computer servers around the world performing the translation. Experts say the knock-on effect has the potential of 'hurting internet services globally'. Cyberbunker is what is known as a hosting company, meaning it allows organisations to make their websites accessible on the internet by providing space on a server. The company’s website says it will host anything ‘except child porn and anything related to terrorism’. Spamhaus, which has offices in London and Geneva, keeps a database of web servers which are known to be used for malicious purposes, such as sending spam mail for bogus products – such as fake weight-loss pills or Viagra – and earlier this month added Cyberbunker. Spamhaus claims Cyberbunker has launched a huge ‘denial of service’ (DDoS) attack in retaliation by flooding its servers with internet traffic. This is like jamming a mailbox with hundreds of letters at the same time. Professor Alan Woodward, a cyber security expert at the University of Surrey, explained: ‘If you imagine it as a motorway, attacks try to put enough traffic on there to clog up the on and off ramps. ‘With this attack, there’s so much traffic it’s clogging up the motorway itself.’ Matthew Prince, chief executive of internet security firm CloudFare, likened the move to a ‘nuclear bomb’, adding: ‘It’s so easy to cause so much damage.’ David Emm, a senior security researcher with anti-virus firm Kaspersky Labs, said the attack was slowing down the whole internet, adding: ‘It’s like if someone wanted to flood my letterbox with junk mail it would all have to go through the delivery office and that would have an effect on the delivery of other people’s letters. ‘If the mail is coming from all over the place it will have some impact on the wider delivery.’ Steve Linford, chief executive of Spamhaus, told the BBC the scale of the attack was unprecedented and powerful enough to bring down the Government’s computer system. Business . and personal mobile banking customers for Natwest, RBS, and Ulster Bank . are today experiencing problems accessing online accounts - although it . has not yet been confirmed whether this is linked to the attack. A spokesman for the Royal Bank of Scotland group said they were investigating the issue but it was not understood to be linked to the cyber attack. They added: 'We are aware of a technical problem this morning which is preventing customers from logging in to our mobile banking applications. 'We are working to fix the problem and apologise to customers for the inconvenience caused. 'No other systems are affected.' Global impact: Experts say traffic to the Netflix site has been affected by the attack on anti-spam firm SpamHaus . Mr Linford said he could not disclose more details as there were fears those involved may also come under attack. He added that several companies, such as Google, had made their resources available to help absorb the excess traffic. Sven Olaf Kamphuis, who claims to be a spokesman for Cyberbunker, said in an online message that Spamhaus was abusing its position and should not be allowed to decide ‘what goes and does not go on the internet’. He added: ‘We are aware that this is one of the largest DDoS attacks the world had publicly seen.’ Experts say such attacks are growing in power and are now six times larger than recent ones against American banks. Cyber attacks are becoming an increasing threat to large organisations that rely on the internet. While yesterday’s chaos was the result of a feud between large online firms, those who organise and carry out the attacks are more often amateur computer activists working in their bedrooms. In January two so-called ‘hacktivists’ were jailed in London for attacks which cost corporate organisations, such as Paypal, Mastercard and Visa, many millions of pounds. And earlier this month it was revealed that prominent Americans such as Michelle Obama and Tiger Woods were the victims of suspected Russian cyber hackers who allegedly published financial information. It is unclear whether the alleged attack by Cyberbunker has broken any laws.

"A frozen Ferris wheel, poisoned forests and paint sloughing off an empty swimming pool; these are the remains of a city devastated by a nuclear disaster nearly 30 years ago. Pripyat in Ukraine, once home to a population of 50,000, was just a few miles from the Chernobyl power plant which exploded in 1986. Now, a Devon-based documentary maker, Danny Cooke, has captured the area in decay by flying around the abandoned area using a camera attached to a drone. Video below . The footage shows Pripyat being taken over by nature. Eerie views of rusted bumper cars and scattered papers are placed alongside golden flowers and trees growing among buildings. While many images have emerged of Pripyat since the disaster, this footage is the first to provide a drone's-eye view of its abandoned remains. 'Chernobyl is one of the most interesting and dangerous places I've been,' Mr Cooke wrote. 'The nuclear disaster, which happened in 1986 (the year after I was born), had an effect on so many people, including my family when we lived in Italy. Eerie: A swimming pool slowly going to ruins after being abandoned decades ago. The explosion released 400 times more radiation than the U.S. atomic bomb dropped over Hiroshima . 'I can't imagine how terrifying it would have been for the hundreds of thousands of locals who evacuated.' Scientists are deeply divided on how many have died as a result of the explosion, which released about 400 times more radiation than the U.S. atomic bomb dropped over Hiroshima. Mr Cooke filmed the footage, named 'Postcards from Pripyat, Chernobyl', while working on a '60 Minutes' segment for CBS News about the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. It was captured using a Geiger counter, a DJI Phantom 2 quadcopter, a Canon 7D camera and a GoPro3+. Abandoned: A frozen ferris wheel, poisoned forests and paint sloughing off an empty swimming pool; these are the remains of city devastated by a nuclear disaster nearly 30 years ago . Pripyat is now believed to be safe to visit for short periods as the isotopes released during the disaster have since decayed. 'During my stay, I met so many amazing people, one of which was my guide Yevgein, also known as a 'Stalker',' said Mr Cooke . 'We spent the week together exploring Chernobyl and the nearby abandoned city of Prypiat. There was something serene, yet highly disturbing about this place. The Chernobyl disaster was a catastrophic nuclear accident that occurred on 26 April 1986 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine. An explosion and fire released large quantities of radioactive particles into the atmosphere, which spread over much of the western USSR and Europe. The Chernobyl disaster is the worst nuclear power plant accident in history in terms of cost and casualties, and is one of only two classified as a level 7 event on the International Nuclear Event Scale. The battle to contain the contamination and avert a greater catastrophe ultimately involved over 500,000 workers and cost an estimated £11 billion ($18 billion). During the accident 31 people died, and long-term effects such as cancers and deformities are still being accounted for. 'Time has stood still and there are memories of past happenings floating around us.' The accident occurred during a systems test on April 26, 1986 and created a huge explosion and fire which released large quantities of radioactive particles into the atmosphere, spreading over western USSR and Europe. Soviet officials did not report the disaster for several days. Even in the plant workers' town of Pripyat, few knew what had happened when the plant's No. 4 reactor blew up around 1.30am in the morning. Disturbing: Mr Cooke filmed the footage, named 'Postcards from Pripyat, Chernobyl', while working on a '60 Minutes' segment for CBS News about the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. The official acknowledgement came three days later and the government evacuated 350,000 residents from Chernobyl and Pripyat. An exclusion zone covering an area of more than 1,000sq miles around the abandoned plant was created to protect people from the effects of any lingering radiation. Although tens of thousands of people evacuated the area, a few residents refused to leave. A handful of older residents moved back to be close to family graves. Tourists may obtain day passes, and some workers who are rebuilding parts of the site are allowed in for limited hours only each month. Scientists say the area will not be safe to live in for another 20,000 years.

I didn't react at the time, although I wanted to kill her, but when I got home I looked in the mirror and asked myself why she might think think I was sister's mother.' Linda examined her face closely: 'I thought to myself, yes, you've got a turkey neck, lines like the Grand Canyon and centipedes round the eyes. I screamed and cried and thought, yes, time for a facelift!' She began her bid for youth and beauty with an upper and lower eyelid reduction and a partial facelift and since the first surgery in 1999, has had more than 50 procedures. 'It was about six months later [after the first operation] that I started to feel better and thought ""yes, I can deal with this"",' she explains, adding: 'It's changed my life beyond recognition.' Natural: Linda says she won't have extreme surgery because she wants a naturally youthful look . As she was: Linda (right) pictured at her sister's wedding in 1999 before she had surgery . 'I think I now appreciate the things that can be tamed with cosmetic surgery and that makes me less willing to tolerate things I don't like. If it's easy and I can go and do it, then I will go and do it.'Her next operation is a breast lift and she's planning to travel to Paris to get the perfect perky pair. 'The distance doesn't come into it really,' she reveals. 'I just need the boobs! She continued: I think my boobs look quite old at the . moment, they're not as saggy as some I've seen but they do look like . they're getting on towards 60, which I will be on my next birthday. 'To . have the boobs of a 29-year-old would be a bonus.' Appearing in Channel 5 documentary, 200 Nips and Tucks and I Want More, Linda is seen travelling to the French capital for the operation. 'If the surgery works, I will definitely . be going braless on my 60th birthday,' she reveals. 'My friends and family will think . I'm a bit of a tart but I don't care! 'I will buy a nice silk dress and . wear nothing underneath. I'm very blase about the operation and I don't get worried . about it because I know I've spent time choosing the right surgeon, . anaesthetic, clinic and everything else.' After the operation, Linda is seen inspecting her new breasts which, much to her delight, are just what she'd hoped for. Changing faces: Linda at 59 looks younger than she did 10 years ago thanks to her love of surgery . Happier: Linda says her ultimate triumph will come when she's a gorgeous corpse in her coffin . 'All of me probably looks about 45 but my . boobs are 30,' she burbles. 'I don't think people can tell I've had surgery because I try to keep it natural. She adds: 'I will never grow old gracefully - I will grow old as disgracefully as I possibly can. I don't think I have an addiction. 'If there's something I . don't like about myself, I will have it corrected. That's not an . addiction. The ultimate triumph for me will be when I'm a good-looking . corpse!'

"Flowers, chocolates, jewellery, perfume, yawn, snore, bleurgh.... Is it just us, or are typical Valentine's Day gifts beginning to feel a little bit tired? If you too are bored of the traditional 14 February cliches, perhaps it's time to take a page out of this innovative American husband's book. Or, rather, to tear a leaf out of his Post-it notepad.... In what is possibly the cheapest (and most adorable) Valentine's gift we've heard of this year, Jesse Ben Hale, a creative wedding photographer from Kansas, has set about telling his wife Holly that he loves her every day for 100, with reasons why she's so special scribbled on 100 Post-it notes. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Day 20: I love that you help me remember stuff . For the price of a packet of yellow Post-its and a biro (less than £2, or $3), Jesse has touchingly recorded all the reasons he thinks his beloved is so fabulous. He has then filmed each one, posting them to Give It 100, a website encouraging people to pursue a creative project for 100 days. Jesse is 25 days into his project, and has so far offered reasons for his devotion that range from the touching ('you listen to my stories') to the funny ('you secretly like cats') to the sincerely proud ('you don't like going to work, but you are stonking good at your job'). The project is titled simply: 'I'm telling my wife I love her for 100 days.' Alongside the husband's 100-day tribute to his wife, other site users have remarked how devoted he is, and what a lovely idea his is. Nancie commented that 'every woman in the world will be in love with you!' while Morgann said: 'This is a really cute idea. I'm sure she loves it.'

"Most medical trials involve spending a couple of days in a dressing gown playing video games while popping a new brand of aspirin, and being written a check for a few hundred pounds at the end of it. But to be rewarded with the big bucks you have to take the big risks. And you'll always find someone willing to put their neck - or, in this case, their testicles - on the line. For the past six years Mark Parisi from Las Vegas has been volunteering in medical studies, and the more extreme the better. It means he gets free medical check-ups, saving himself over $750 (£457) a year.

"A young woman who witnessed three Muslim women being threatened on a Melbourne train claimed police were reluctant to investigate the incident and only took it seriously when she vented her anger on Twitter. Law student Dana Affleck, 24, was on a train in Melbourne last Thursday just before 6pm when she witnessed a man screaming, threatening and banging on a window when he saw three elderly Muslim women wearing veils. ‘He was standing up and screaming abuse the entire time he was on the train, as soon as he saw the three women in veils,’ Ms Affleck told Daily Mail Australia. ‘He was a big, imposing figure. An Aussie, Anglo guy. He was enraged and seemed unstable. 'There was spit flying out of his mouth.’ Scroll down for video . Melbourne Law student Dana Affleck was on a Melbourne train when she witnessed three elderly Muslim women being threatened and verbally abused by what appeared to be a Australian 'anglo' man. Ms Affleck had boarded the train at the same time as the women, two of whom appeared to be in their seventies and the third in her fifties. They were all wearing veils and long dresses, according to Miss Affleck. 'The man was screaming from the second he saw them. We were terrified. He was way past being stood up to,' said Miss Affleck. Ms Affleck, the three Muslim women and another passenger left the train as soon as it came to the next stop, North Richmond Station. The man continued his raging tirade after the train doors closed. ‘He came up on the window and started bashing on the glass and screaming abuse at them. We were all scared. ‘I was just waiting for the glass to smash because there was so much force.’ Miss Affleck says she was distressed by the incident and shocked that the women considered the verbal abuse to be normal. Ms Affleck, who is not Muslim, says that the victims of the abuse did not seem shocked and believed calling police would be futile. 'I was apologising profusely, worried if they were okay,' said Miss Affleck. ‘They didn't appear shocked, they seemed to take it as a given. The fact they were so accustomed to it really frightened me.' The tweet Dana Affleck sent which caused Social Media outrage and allegedly forced Victoria Police to act . Miss Affleck placed a call to East Melbourne police station, where a police officer 'refused' to take her call seriously. Their is allegedly no record of the phone call that Miss Affleck made after the incident. Ms Affleck called the closest police station, East Melbourne, to report the incident, prompted by Victoria Police Commissioner Ken Lay urging members of the public to report instances of Islamophobic abuse in the wake of last week's shooting of a known extremist. 'Ken Lay told Australia to come forward and report instances of where Muslims are being abused, but is that message reaching the officers at the local police stations who take the calls?' she said. Miss Affleck called twice and when she realised she was not being taken seriously, she launched a Twitter campaign to bring attention to the terrifying abuse of the three Muslim women. ‘The police officer who answered the phone would not transfer me or pass the message on to anyone. ‘He said there’s nothing they can do unless the victims come forward.' This didn't seem right to Miss Affleck. That night, when speaking with a friend who is a legal professional, Ms Affleck learnt that she was well within her rights to make the complaint as a witness. 'Police should take a report. You don’t need a victim if someone is causing trouble in a public place,' she said. East Melbourne Police Station (pictured) were contacted several times by Daily Mail Australia but did not make any comment at the time of publication. A member from the police station has been in contact with Miss Affleck after her Twitter campaign. ‘I shouldn’t have called police. The first mistake I made was not calling 000. Then it would have been a mandate to follow up the call.' The following day, Ms Affleck called again for an update, only to learn that there was no record of her first phone call to the station. Ms Affleck decided to take to Twitter to explain her concerns about the lack of police action. 'Saw 3 Muslim women being threatened. Called @VictoriaPolice, said can't help, took details. Called again, no record of call,' she tweeted. The message was retweeted almost 200 times and she was flooded with messages,with members of the public expressing their disappointment and offering advice. ‘I had to kick up a huge fuss for anything to happen. I started a Twitter campaign,' she said. 'Victoria Police got in touch with me on Monday. ‘It makes you wonder whether the statements that Ken Lay say  are just purely PR.’ Ms Affleck has been told that the incident is being investigated, with Victoria Police examining CCTV footage. Victoria Police confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that they pursued the matter when they saw Ms Affleck’s negative comments on social media, and wanted to address her issues with East Melbourne Police Station. Mariam Veiszadeh, a lawyer and humanitarian from the Islamophobia Register Australia says many Australian Muslim women feel there isn't anyone who can help them with their concerns. Mariam Veiszadeh, a lawyer and humanitarian from the Islamophobia Register Australia, became aware of the incident on Twitter. She says many Australian Muslim women do not report abuse because they feel there isn't anyone to help them with their concerns. 'Australian Muslim women have almost become indifferent to the situation . 'There’s a helplessness, a sense that nothing will be done.' 'There’s a sense of mistrust amongst the community when it comes to authorities. What I would call for is police to take a strong stance.' Ms Veiszadeh has been meeting with NSW Police authorities on behalf of the Islamophobia Register and feel insufficient resources are being committed to dealing with cases of targeted abuse, considering in the current climate. 'My sense, meeting with them, is that there are insufficient resources being committed to this issue at a state level. I imagine it is the same in Victoria. Miss Veiszadeh says every incident of racial abuse needs to be reported. 'We shouldn’t have to wait for another person to be have their head kicked in to be taken seriously. 'Verbal abuse is just as offensive and damaging as physical abuse. 'This (Dana Affleck) is an excellent example of someone going out of their way to record the incident.' Miss Veiszadeh says every incident of racial abuse needs to be reported.'We shouldn’t have to wait for another person to be have their head kicked in to be taken seriously.'","Woman witnessed three Muslim women being abused on a Melbourne train .

"An 11-year-old girl killed by a stray bullet is among the two dead and nearly two dozen other people wounded by yet another brutal night of gun violence in Chicago. Shamiya Adams was making s'mores inside a South Side home for a sleepover Friday night when a bullet went into the house and struck her in the head. A 30-year-old man was also shot dead, police said. An additional 20 people were injured across the city. As usual, the bulk of the violence occurred on the South and West Sides – a refrain that is now playing out on a nightly basis. Senseless: Shamiya Adams, 11, was killed by a stray bullet in front of her friends while making s'mores during a sleepover inside the home of her best friend . ‘They were just running around through the house, dancing. That's all they do is dance all the time. And dancing, dancing, dancing,’ homeowner Rosemarie Jones told WLS. Until a bullet came through the wall and struck Adams in the head, according to police, she was rushed to a nearby hospital and died Saturday morning. ‘The familiarity of laughter has been replaced by the familiarity of gunfire,’ Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said in a Saturday morning press briefing. The innocent girl was making s'mores with her friends when the bullet struck her, according to the Chicago Tribune. Her young friends saw the bullet strike her head. Hours after the girl was rushed to a hospital and as police still searched for her killer without any solid leads, marshmallows and chocolate bars were still scattered over the bed Adams and friends were on, according to the paper. Spattered traces of the 11-year-old girl's blood were observed just under a stuffed Tweety Bird doll hanging on the wall. Adams was enjoying her summer vacation with her friends like any other girl her age. 'They were just doing their girlie things,' a resident of the house who was not home at the time of the shooting told the paper. 'They heard shots and a bullet came through the window.' The children were likely inside because of how dangerous the city's West Side, where the home is, becomes on summer nights. Adams’ mother was protective of her to . the point the young girl was rarely allowed to go out, those who knew . her say. It was the 11-year-old’s first sleepover. ‘She . don't let Shamiya go much unless she go to family and then the first . time you let her go something like this happens? This is really eating . her up,’ Nanette Dailey told the station. Devastated: Shaneetha Goodloe, left, mother of 11-year-old Shamiya Adams who died after being shot Friday night, hugs some of Shamiya's friends during a Saturday vigil near the Chicago apartment building where Shamiya was hit by a stray bullet . On the scene: Police officers and detectives gather Friday night at the home where Adams was shot during a sleepover . ‘I . got nothing left to say to these moms,’ Emanuel continued. ‘I don't . know where they find the strength to go on, put one foot in front of . another. Because she had the... she wanted her daughter to play with her . friends. We're a better city than that.’ But statistics paint a different picture. Despite city officials infamously claiming “crime is down” earlier this year, murders are on pace to at least equal last year’s total. There have so far this year been 223 shooting deaths this year, according to an independent website that tracks crime and mayhem in Chicago. There were 454 shooting deaths in Chicago in 2013. The 223rd person shot to death this year in the city was an unidentified 30-year-old man found in a car parked in an alley at 10.00 p.m. by police – only half an hour after Adams was shot. He had multiple gunshot wounds to his neck, back and shoulder, according to the Chicago Tribune, and was pronounced dead at the scene. Point of entry: The stray bullet exit hole in the closet wall of the apartment where Adams killed while making s'mores with friends . Among the injured were four men who showed up with unexplained gunshot wounds at a West Side hospital, authorities said. Two 15-year-old boys were shot in unrelated incidents. One suffered only a wound to his leg, the Tribune reported. The other told doctors he was on a sidewalk when someone walked up and shot him in the arm and foot. A 26-year-old was shot after arguing with a male in a car parked on the same street corner where he was standing, cops said. The male got out of the car, opened fire and fled. No arrests have been made in any of the shootings.","Shamiya Adams was killed Friday night when a stray bullet blew threw the wall of a house she was inside for her first sleepover .

"Mango's new Violeta line ranges from sizes 12-24 . Spanish clothing giant Mango has come under fire from shoppers in the wake of launching a plus-size clothing line for women from sizes 12 to 24. Consumers in Spain and the UK have taken to Twitter irked at the implication that anything over a size 10 is considered 'large'. The Violeta line - which is accompanied by the tag 'it suits me and I like it' - is a 400-piece collection available online now and in stores from tomorrow. A spokesman for Mango said: 'The . secret to this new project lies in the care taken in the technical . pattern details from size to size and in being able to offer a high . quality collection for any moment of the day, aimed at a modern and . demanding woman who wants to feel attractive, sexy and fashionable. 'Consequently, . the aim of Violeta by Mango is to dress a young target market in sizes . 12 to 24 with garments designed to be comfortable, feminine and modern.' But while the Government and fashion editors have celebrated the collection, Mango has been accused by shoppers on Twitter of stigmatising women larger than a size 10, and even encouraging eating disorders. A campaign group in Spain have called for the line's withdrawal. Jenny Willott, Minister for Women and Equalities, told The Times: 'Diversity makes good business sense - research shows that plus-size women are frustrated by the poor choice of fashion available to them and embarrassed by retail environments that separate them from other women. 'I welcome moves by the retail industry to reflect and celebrate the great diversity we have in the UK. I would like to see more retailers doing the same.' While Trish Halpin, Marie Claire's editor-in-chief said 'there's the demand to address the style needs for women of all shapes and sizes. It's great that Mango are engaging with a larger-sized audience'. But Spanish shoppers say the line is alienating to larger women and stigmatising to those who are smaller, and should be withdrawn. One lawyer, Arantxa Calvera, launched an online petition that already has 57,000 signatures. She said: 'To consider a size 12 as a plus size is to have a distorted picture of the reality.' On Twitter, plus-size shoppers commented that the line was too 'beige', and that they were 'underwhelmed'. A petition to have the line withdrawn is making its way around Spain . Twitter users were shocked that size 12 was considered a plus size . There was concern that the line stigmatises women . Plus models called the line 'underwhelming' and 'beige' A spokesman for Mango said: 'In view of the controversy surrounding the launch of Violeta by MANGO, the company would like to reiterate that Violeta by MANGO is a new brand within the group which was created to cover an existing demand in the market by offering a fashion collection in sizes that extend up to 24. 'What differentiates said brand is the attention to technical details, pattern to pattern and size to size, and the selection of garment materials and fabrics, which have been produced to be more comfortable, feminine and modern. 'The key characteristic of this line is the personalisation of the collection to a new target market, the result of painstaking work and effort on the silhouette and pattern of each size.'","Mango's new 'plus-size' Violeta fashion line comes in sizes 12 to 24 .

"Many of us, at some point, will have noticed a moment at home when the lights go dim for a split-second. We might, suspecting that our eyes are playing tricks, ask someone else whether they saw it, too. When they confirm that they have, we’re grateful that we haven’t imagined things, and then get on with our evening. But imagine if the lights went dim and then stayed like that for several hours — or perhaps even several days. That would certainly be something to worry about. Such events are called ‘brown-outs’, because they are one step short of a full black-out. They occur when the voltage to a home or office — the amount of electrical energy being supplied — drops below its normal level. Although brown-outs are a regular occurrence in the U.S., where electrical infrastructure is creaking, they are almost unheard of in this country. Indeed, the term itself will be unfamiliar to many. However, this winter it is highly likely that we shall come to know the term all too well. Brown-outs are set to become a frequent and unwelcome feature of our lives. Although brown-outs may seem innocuous at first, they are in fact potentially extremely damaging to electronic equipment such as computers, set-top boxes, wireless routers and even many digital clocks found on household appliances such as ovens. What makes things more worrying is that the brown-outs, if they do happen, will be deliberately brought about by the National Grid. But why would it do something so damaging? And what can we as consumers do to protect ourselves from the consequences? The answer to the first question lies in the simple fact that Britain’s power supplies are almost completely over-stretched. So much so that this week the Energy Secretary Ed Davey — who has been forced to deny that blackouts are looming — will unveil a package of contingency measures to reduce pressures on the National Grid this winter. They include paying hotels to turn down refrigerators, and paying companies to change shifts for staff to make the most efficient use of energy. This extraordinary situation — Britain once had the most reliable electricity supply in the world — is thanks to a medley of mishaps across Britain’s power stations. The most recent was certainly dramatic. Last weekend, there was a fire at the Didcot B gas-powered power station near Oxford. Although the blaze could have been a lot worse — 25 fire engines fought the flames — it did succeed in destroying a unit that supplies power to half-a-million households. That is not something which can be quickly replaced. By itself, the fire at Didcot would not have severely dented the nation’s power supply, but there are already four other power stations out of action because of various fires and faults. Together, the five stations that are closed would normally generate a massive 4.3 gigawatts of power, or 7 per cent of the UK’s total electricity capacity. In relative terms, that percentage may not seem that large, but that capacity does need to be found from somewhere else, especially as winter approaches. What’s more, demand for electricity shot up this weekend, when the clocks went back to GMT, which means a greater demand for street lighting in the late afternoons. According to some experts, that means the National Grid may well find it hard to cope, as it now has so little capacity in reserve. In summer, there is usually enough energy in reserve to cope with any problems, but in the winter, services are stretched to capacity. Not easily replaced: Fire crews spray water at the scene of a fire at Didcot B Power Station in Oxfordshire.The blaze could have been but it did succeed in destroying a unit that supplies power to half-a-million households . Peter Atherton, an industry expert, has said: ‘We still have enough capacity to meet demand — provided that nothing else goes down and that we don’t have a cold winter. So much depends on the weather.’ If this winter is, indeed, cold — and the long-range forecast suggests that December might be colder than average — then the National Grid could be in trouble, especially if another one or two power stations suffer from mishaps. Mr Atherton says that normally he would put the odds of an event happening that threatens the security of supply at about one in 20. ‘A week ago I would have said one in four and now I’d say one in three.’ If the National Grid struggles to meet demand, then — as Ed Davey will make clear — businesses are first obliged to cut down on their energy usage, by doing basic things such as turning off office lights at night, cutting back on air-conditioning use or running heavy-duty machinery only when necessary. In order to create an incentive, the Government believes it will have to pay firms to reduce their demand. However, if Davey’s plans are not enough, the National Grid will be forced to reduce the amount of electrical power, or volts, going to our homes. This will result in brown-outs, which are considered to be far less disruptive than full black-outs. As a result, a reduced voltage entering into our homes may play havoc with many of our home technology appliances. The reasons for this are a little technical, but in layman’s terms, many devices such as set-top boxes and computers, when faced with a diminution of power, will need to draw more current — the rate of flow of electricity, which is measured in amps — in order to compensate. Drawing more current confuses the internal ‘organs’ of computerised devices, and can cause them not only to become less efficient and slower, but also to break down. With so many of us using and relying on such devices, it’s clear that regular brown-outs could not only make our lives more miserable but also severely affect the country’s economy. So how can we protect ourselves? First, if you notice the lights getting dim, turn off and unplug all devices such as computers, set-top boxes, and appliances that have digital clocks. Although TVs are built to be less sensitive to voltage changes, it is worth playing it safe and switching them off, too, to ensure they are not damaged. Brown-outs can also damage mini-motors, such as those in fridges. Although most are hardy enough to deal with very short brown-outs of, say, a few minutes, many might struggle over longer periods. If you can turn the appliance off, then consider doing so. However, if you cannot bear to turn some devices off or need them because you are working from home, then you should invest in some form of generator. Petrol generators can cost several hundred pounds, although a cheaper option would be to invest in a unit called an ‘uninterruptible power supply’, which will protect devices such as computers and set-top boxes from a fluctuating voltage. Such units are available from many retailers such as Maplin, and they are essentially large batteries that ‘kick in’ when the unit senses that the voltage is diminishing, spiking, or cutting out altogether. Some of the cheaper models cost around £80, and will provide enough power to keep your computer running for around 15 minutes — plenty of time to save your data and anything you are working on. The more expensive models can cost many hundreds of pounds or more, but may be worth the investment if you do work from home. Meanwhile, Ed Davey is doing his best to ensure that we do not panic. A spokesman for his Department of Energy and Climate Change declared: ‘The lights will not go out this winter. ‘Up and down the country there are power stations on stand-by that can start pumping out power when needed, and the Government has given the National Grid extra powers it needs to ensure there is enough electricity to keep the lights on.’ Even if the lights do stay on, we may find them dimmed by a brown-out. Of course, the lights may stay on, but they may go ‘brown’. If that does happen, then it is best to be prepared.","Didcot B fire and other problems could seriously cut energy production .

"Sudan, a country ravaged by a brutal civil war that claimed more than 2.5 million lives over five decades, was finally split in two in 2011. And the world's newest country is now home to the world's newest national football team, dubbed the African Tigers by besotted fans. Zoran Djordjevic - an impassioned and eccentric Serbian football coach who has worked with 14 national teams, including Bangladesh and Yugoslavia - was invited by the Ministry of Sport and Culture to take charge. Coach Zoran and His African Tigers: The South Sudan national team with coach Zoran Djordjevic before the team's match against Ethiopia . South Sudan's national team starting line-up: Top, left to right, Richard Jistin, William Ofiri, Philip Delfino, Atar Thomas, Francis Khamis, James Joseph; Bottom, left to right,Thomas Jacob, Jimmy Eresto, Juma Jinaro, Edomon Amadeo and Godfrey Peter . So, despite the fact he had never heard of South Sudan, Zoran travelled to the country and set off immediately on a scouting mission. And there he discovered the obstacles faced by South Sudan's very first national football team to be world's apart from those tackled on the pitches of other countries. Young British documentary filmmaker Sam Benstead was in South Sudan when he heard about a determined coach who claimed he would find his new team a place in the 2014 World Cup, so he travelled to the capital city of Juba to meet him. Patriotic: A picture taken on June 26, 2012 shows South Sudan national football team's coach Zoran Djordjevic looking at his players as they put their left hands over their hearts before shouting 'Long live South Sudan' as part of a ritual performed before and after a training session, in Juba . The coach and his team: Zoran soon discovered that the problems faced by a football team in South Sudan would be quite different to any he had faced before . Chabur Goc Alei, the newly appointed President of the Football Association of South Sudan, told Benstead that the formation of a federation and a national team 'brought great hope to South Sudan'. One talented young player said: 'Death became a way of life in Sudan. We are not . politicians, we are just footballers, but our sport can bring . peace to a town full of war.' But a lack of funding meant that Zoran - who says he will give everything, even 'money and blood' to motivate his team - set off to scout for players... on a public bus. And without a road map. 'This is not Europe there is no map,' he was told by local people. Zoran named his team The Tigers ('We are tigers, champions, winners, real men!'), but soon learned that even tigers couldn't demolish the problems faced by such a new country. On the pitch: South Sudan's James Joseph, right, fights for the ball with Zanzibar's Sabri Ali Makhame during the Council for East and Central Africa Football Associations (CECAFA) Cup football tournament match between South Sudan and Zanzibar in Nairobi, on November 27, 2013 . A man and his sheep: Champion, the South Sudanese team mascot, whom Zoran feels will bring luck and prosperity to his men . For once he had collated a team of talented young men and played their first match, the South Sudanese government announced they were ceasing oil production in order to cut off the dependent North. Austerity measures cut all funds for Sports and Culture, and Zoran was not paid for six months. He appealed to the ministry but to no avail, by which time he was struck down by malaria. And though he survived to care for his sheep, Champion, the team mascot; one of his players did not. Eventually the new pitch was locked, Zoran and his team left with nowhere to play, and the passionate Serbian declaring: 'The country is sabotaging these young people who have great spirit, great talent, and great willing. And this is criminal in sport.' Benstead's film explores the courage and determination of Zoran and his players, and the challenges they face in continuing to play national football in such a young and, once again, dangerous country. Determination: Despite his courageousness, Zoran faced many obstacles when forming the team . South Sudan today: Children playing in South Sudan, today .

"Former Britain's Got Talent winners Ashley and Pudsey certainly learned a few of their tricks from the athletic four-legged creatures who'll be hanging around Birmingham for the next four days. Crufts 2014 began today, and the world famous dog eventing competition has already yielded some terrific photo opportunities, with breeds big and small (and very big and very small) strutting their stuff in the NEC arena and leaping over bars in the agility tests. Furthermore, with London Fashion Week over, it was time for our four-legged friends to show us what they have hanging in their own Spring/Summer 2014 wardrobes. A dog rests in its kennel at the end of the first day of Crufts dog show at the NEC in Birmingham . A small dog sits with a decorative ruff as its owner relaxes at the dog show and competition .

Bull Mastiffs, Alaskan Malamutes and Giant Schnauzers were lead into the . arena by their nervous owners, to take their seats in the arena . corridors and prepare for their presentation.

It seems onesies are not only popular in human wardrobes, but that the pedigree dogs showing at Crufts this year - such as this enormous Komondor - are also fond of them . The four-day event is the world's largest dog show, and today features competitions from 9am until 5.15pm. Categories include agility, freestyle and heelwork to music. There will also be various displays from groups including the the West Midlands Police and the East Anglian Staffordshire Bull Terriers. There are also a number of events solely for children and their dogs. Tomorrow's competition is for Terrier and Hound breeds, Saturday's is for Toy and Utility breeds, and on Sunday the Gundogs will compete.rufts is one of the largest dog events in the world. No longer purely a dog show, Crufts celebrates every aspect of the role that dogs play in our lives.It has changed in ways that couldn’t possibly have been imagined when the show was set up in Victorian times by the late Charles Cruft. Although it was a very different event in 1891 Charles Cruft was a great showman and would surely have enjoyed the size and scope of the event today, which is an essential date in any dog lover’s calendar.

Two dogs on approach to the competition, wearing tiny boots to protect their feet from the wet ground . Crufts began in the Victorian period, set up by dog fanatic and showman Charles Cruft in 1891 to celebrate dogs and the role they play in our lives. It has evolved since the 19th century, but still has this celebration of dogs at its heart. As organisers say: 'Judges are trained to ensure that only . healthy dogs win prizes, which in turn encourages the breeding of . healthy dogs. But the event is now about so much more besides. 'Crufts is ultimately a celebration of all dogs. It celebrates working dogs, which are fit and healthy enough to perform the jobs for which they were originally bred, such as those in the Gamekeeper classes or which line up for the Police Dog Team Operational and Humanitarian Action of the Year award, and it hails hero dogs through the Friends for Life competition. 'Rescue dogs are celebrated in the rescue dog agility competition and the speed and agility of dogs is celebrated in the ever popular competitions of Flyball and Heelwork to Music.' The first Crufts show was held in 1981 in the Royal Agricultural Hall in Islington. A dog pulls a trolley as he leaves with his owner at the end of the first day of Crufts .

"A size eight woman had no idea she was pregnant... until her waters broke while she was walking her dog. Even then, Chelsea-Vove Child, 22, just thought there was something wrong with her bladder, so went to A&E with her fiance Phil Jarvis to have herself checked out. And when doctors at York Hospital told her she was about to have a baby she was completely dumbstruck, chiefly because she had never missed a contraceptive pill and had put on scarcely any weight. When Chelsea-Vove Child, 22, pictured, felt her waters break while she was walking her dog, she just thought there was something wrong with her bladder, but three days later she gave birth to baby Jayden . She said: 'It was Friday the 13th and I . thought they were joking. I was in complete shock. The doctor said to . me: ""Never in my life have I seen this. Are you sure you didn't know?"" 'But I really had no idea. I didn't look . pregnant at all. In the last month I'd put on a tiny bit of weight, but I . put this down to comfort eating because I'd just lost a friend to lung . cancer.' Chelsea continued: 'My friend died on 11 November, and I'd spent the last eight months as his full-time carer. 'Since his death I'd put on about half a stone, and gone from a size eight to a size 10, but no way did I look pregnant. 'I just thought I needed to go on a diet. I started doing sit-ups and told myself I'd start going to the gym in January.'Chelsea, who lives with chef Phil, 42, in York, was transferred immediately to the hospital's labour ward. Chelsea and Phil, who met three years ago . while they were both working at the same bar in York city centre, were . thrilled to finally take Jayden, pictured, home on Monday . She said: 'We were both in complete shock. I'd never wanted children - I just wasn't a children person. Phil already had a daughter from a previous relationship, and having children of our own was something we'd never discussed. 'When we got to the labour ward I was next to a woman who was screaming her head off and I just thought: 'Oh my God, that's going to be me soon'. I couldn't believe I was about to give birth. 'I fell in love immediately. I just sat looking at him . thinking: ""How has this happened?"" I didn't want a baby, but now he's here I don't regret it at all.' 'Luckily, the nurses realised I need some peace and quiet to come to terms with what was happening and they moved me into a private room. I was there for three days before my contractions started.' And after a very quick labour lasting just one hour and nine minutes, Chelsea's son Jayden arrived on 16 December 16 weighing 4lbs 1oz. She said: 'They put him on my chest straight away and all I could think was: ""What have I just done?"" 'He was born one month prematurely, so they had to take him away to the special care baby unit to check he was OK. 'Later that day I was allowed to go and see him - and I fell in love immediately. I just sat looking at him thinking: ""How has this happened?"" 'I didn't want a baby, but now he's here I don't regret it at all. 'Despite being premature, he's really healthy and fortunately the fact I kept drinking because I didn't know I wasn't pregnant hasn't affected him.' Phil Jarvis, 42, with his fiance Chelsea-Vove Child, 22, with their baby Jayden who was born in York Hospital on 16 December . Chelsea and Phil, who met three years ago while they were both working at the same bar in York city centre, were thrilled to finally take Jayden home on Monday, 6 January, after more than three weeks in hospital. She said: 'I still can't believe I'm a mum. Looking back now there were a couple of signs. Back in July I'd been sick for about three days, but I just thought I had a virus that was going round. Now I know that was morning sickness. 'I'd also been having a few feelings in my tummy, but I'd just put that down to stress because of caring for my terminally-ill friend. 'I hadn't been having any periods, but that wasn't unusual for me. 'I think I was so preoccupied with looking after my terminally-ill friend I wasn't paying attention to my own body.' She said family and friends had rallied round to help kit them out with secondhand baby clothes and equipment. She said: 'We obviously hadn't been planning financially to have a baby, so the support from family and friends has been amazing. 'My life has suddenly changed forever, but I'm so happy. I love Jayden to bits.'","Chelsea-Vove Child, 22, went to York Hospital with fiance Phil Jarvis, 42 .

Police say Nolen, a recent convert to Islam, attacked Hufford after learning he'd been suspended from his job at the plant. After decapitating Hufford, Nolan allegedly attacked his other co-worker Traci Johnson, 43, who suffered serious injuries but survived. The owner of the plant, Sheriff's Deputy Mark Vaughn, put an end to the carnage when he grabbed a rifle and shot Nolen. in the days after the tragic killing, Hufford, a wife, mother and grandmother, was described by her friends and family as a 'beautiful soul' who loved sports and was known for her upbeat personality. Mrs Hufford, who had been married to her husband KC for 25 years, had only just recovered from the trauma of losing her family home in the devastating Moore tornado last year. She is survived by her daughter, Kelli, and granddaughter, Riley. Her neighbors described her as 'quick to smile' and said her husband picked her up from the food processing plant every night and he was outside when he found out she had been killed.

The photo above shows the woman with her daughter and granddaughter . A funeral for Mrs Hufford was held at a Baptist church in Moore last week. Around 450 mourners attended the service, which was closed to the media. In an official statement issued two days before the funeral, her family mourned their loss and deplored the violence which led to her death. It said: 'Losing our mom, wife and grandmother has been one of the most difficult challenges any of us have faced in our lives'. 'For her life to have been taken in such a tragic act of violence adds a depth of grief we are trying to comprehend.' It was revealed in late September that Nolen had served less than two years of a six-year prison sentence for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. According to records, he went to prison March 10, 2011, to start a two-year sentence for marijuana possession and another two-year sentence for assaulting a highway patrol trooper, the website reported. He began his six-year sentence for cocaine possession April 26, 2011. Records show that due to plea agreements, he was allowed to serve the three prison sentences at the same time. He was released on March 22, 2013, the documents reveal. Disgruntled: Police say Nolen, a recent convert to Islam, attacked Hufford after learning he'd been suspended from his job at the plant .

On Nolen's Facebook page, listed under the name Jah'Keem Yisrael, he posted photos of Osama bin Laden and Taliban fighters, along with posts condemning a variety of aspects of American life. Posts ranged from religious iconography to stock photography to even photos of supposed UFO activity. It also included a graphic photo of a beheading. Nolen's family members have said that they were surprised to learn of his conversion and never spoke about Islam explicitly with them. Nolen's mother and sister posted a video message on Facebook over the weekend saying they were shocked and saddened by the allegations against him. 'My son was raised up in a loving home. My son was raised up believing in God,' his mother, Joyce Nolen, said in the video. ""Our hearts bleed right now because of what they're saying Alton has done.

'In no way, shape or form did he represent Islam in this foolish act,' said Saad Mohammad, director of information for the Islamic Society of Greater Oklahoma City. He added that he remembers the suspect was 'a little weird'. 'He acted a little odd,' Mohammed said, though he added that Nolen's behavior never raised any 'red flags' since he began worshiping at one of the group's centers in May. He also said that Nolen attended services where sermons were delivered against beheadings like those committed by Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, militants, reports CBS News. Lewis said Nolen was fired right before the attack, and that he then drove from the building that houses the company's human resources department to its main distribution center. Once inside, he attacked Mrs Hufford with a knife in the center's administrative office area, eventually severing her head, according to police. Nolen then repeatedly stabbed Ms Johnson .

"A Los Angeles man has survived an apparent suicide attempt at a gas station after setting himself on fire on Wednesday night. Investigators say the driver - who has not been named or aged - was filling up at the Shell station on Clairemont Mesa Boulevard in Kearny Mesa, San Diego, about 5.30pm. The man allegedly took the gas hose to his SUV, sat inside, sprayed fuel over himself and set himself alight. The car quickly went up in flames, prompting a quick-thinking attendant inside to flip an emergency switch that cut the gas lines, according to NBC San Diego. Flamer: A man has somehow survived setting himself on fire in apparent suicide attempt in San Diego . Fire: Footage of the dramatic incident in Kearny Mesa was taken by a passer-by . Help: The footage shows one man (left) running over to the car with a bucket to try and put out the fire . Extinguish: The man throws the water on the SUV but it does not put out the flames . Close call: The car at the gas pump next to the one on fire only narrowly missed going up in flames too . The move, according to authorities, prevented a potential explosion. Witnesses at the next pump said the man fled the car once he caught fire. Covered in flames, he ran away from the pump, jumped to the floor and did the drop-and-roll technique. He suffered burns to 50 percent of his body. However he somehow survived and is now recovering in hospital. Cell phone video from witnesses showed fire shooting from the vehicle. Burn out: Investigators examine the wreck of the car following the incident . Shut down: The gas station had to be closed for several hours following the fire . Scene: The fire occurred at the Shell station on Clairemont Mesa Boulevard in Kearny Mesa, San Diego, about 5.30pm Wednesday . One bystander can be seen running over with a bucket and throwing water on the car. Firefighters extinguished the flames, and paramedics rushed the patient to the UCSD Burn Center. The incident is still being investigated, with police reviewing video footage from the gas station. If it turns out to be a suicide attempt - which they are suspecting - the man could face numerous arson charges.","SUV set alight at a gas station in Kearny Mesa, San Diego, Wednesday night .

"A beloved retired Philadelphia couple was strangled by two men - one they knew for decades - that the hired to do household chores, authorities said Monday. Rufus, 79, and Gladys Perry, 66, were killed by Terry Ballard, 26, and 19-year-old Justen Smith, over some money and a gold necklace, police said. The couple had known Ballard since he was a child. 'For it to be someone that they're familiar with, someone that they knew, makes the pain even greater,' said Donald Carlton, the couple's nephew. Cold-blooded: Justen Smith, left, and Terry Ballard, right, are accused of murdering an elderly Philadelphia couple who hired them to do chores - over only $120 and a gold necklace . The Perrys' lifeless bodies were found early Thursday by daughter Keya Perry in the stairwell of their rowhouse in the city's Strawberry Mansion section. They had abrasions on their faces and necks, Homicide Capt. James Clark said. 'I got a call early this morning from my sister stating that she had seen on the news that dad had died and Gladys,' daughter Renee Ross told WCAU while fighting through tears. 'It was really shocking to me.' Police believe the couple let in the two men during the day on Wednesday to do odd jobs around their home. Things went south when Gladys Perry caught one of the suspect trying to take an envelope of cash he found in the kitchen. The envelope contained only $120, according to the Philadelphia Daily News. He attacked and choked her to death, and her 79-year-old husband was strangled and smothered with a pillow while trying to save her, police said. Devastated: Family members gather outside the Perrys' house in the minutes after the elderly couple's bodies were found inside . Where it happened: The Strawberry mansion neighborhood home where the Perrys lived for decades . Neighbors later told investigators they had seen Ballard and another man in the victims' backyard that day. Officers soon found the suspects and brought them in for questioning. 'They both admitted to their involvement in this brutal and senseless double murder,' Clark said. Ballard, whose grandmother is a close friend of the Perrys, had recently moved back to the neighborhood after several years away, Clark said. He didn't say how Ballard and Smith, whose hometown is in western Pennsylvania, knew each other. Rufus Perry had worked for the city Streets Department, where nephew Donald Carlton now serves as deputy commissioner. Gladys, who is listed in public records as Algladis, had worked as a nurse at a local hospital. The couple kept to themselves but were the rocks of their family — always the first to offer financial or emotional support, said Carlton. He thanked neighbors for helping with the investigation despite the city's pervasive no-snitching culture. 'Too often in these cases, people don't speak, they don't want to get involved,' Carlton said. The fact that people came forward is 'a testament to who my aunt and uncle were.' Ballard and Smith were charged with murder, robbery . and related offenses. It wasn't clear if they had attorneys.","Rufus and Gladys Perry were found dead early Thursday by their daughter .

"A mother who woke up from a coma had lost more than a decade of her memory and thought it was still the 1990s. Candace Emptage had been in a coma for six weeks following a car accident, when she woke up believing she was a 22-year-old woman. In fact she was 40 and was told she was mother to Maddie, then 14. 'They told me I had a daughter and I just stared at them and said, 'what?'' Ms Emptage explained. Scroll down for video . Candace Emptage woke up from a six week coma and thought it was the 1990s, she was 22 and the Spice Girls were number one. In fact it was 2010, she was 40 and mother to Maddie (right), who she didn't recognise . The former model was convinced it was still the 1990s - the decade when the Spice Girls were top of the charts with Wannabe and BSE was the latest health crisis to hit Britain. She said it was incredibly hard dealing with the fact she only had a fleeting image of her daughter at two and could remember nothing of her growing up, let alone recognise the girl standing before her in hospital. Ms Emptage, a former model, lost control of her Toyota MR2 and crashed into the path of an ambulance near Rowlands Gill, Gateshead, Tyne and Wear in September 2010. This was not far from her home in County Durham. She was rescued by firefighters who spent an hour cutting her free from the wreckage and saved her life. While she was in the coma her family discussed turning off her life support at Newcastle General Hospital, but, at the last minute, she was able to move a finger, signalling for them to give her more time. After she woke up Ms Emptage had difficulty adjusting to her memory loss. Ms Emptage woke up from the six week coma thinking she was still 22 (left) but discovered she was 40 . Ms Emptage is pictured with her daughter Maddie but failed to recognise the then 14-year-old in 2010 . Ms Emptage  is building her relationship with Maddie despite being unable to remember her growing up . The former model's family considered turning off her life support in hospital but she then started to move . 'Shock doesn't even come close to what I felt,' she said. 'They told me I had a daughter and I just stared at them and said, 'what?'' Eventually one image of Maddie, who was 14 at the time, came back to me, but she was a tiny little girl of about two. 'When she came to the hospital I had no idea who she was, I just couldn't believe I had a teenage daughter. Memory loss after a head injury, such as that Ms Emptage suffered, is incredibly common and is always unique to the person. Luke Griggs, from brain injury charity Headway, said: 'Memory is not one 'thing' or one skill on its own. It is easily damaged by brain injury because there are several structures within the brain that are involved in processing information, storing it and retrieving it.' Mr Griggs said memory loss often occurs after a brain injury. When people forget information forgotten before the injury this is known as retrograde amnesia. Memory loss usually ranges from a few minutes to a few months. 'However, memory loss after brain injury can be unpredictable and some people may experience more extreme symptoms, particularly with more severe injuries,' he added. 'Every brain injury is unique and there's no 'one size fits all' approach to rehabilitation.' 'I still have no memories of her before the crash, and it has been hard.' Ms Emptage, of Burnopfield, County Durham had also completely forgotten she had a boyfriend of six years who had come to see her every day while she'd been in hospital. The pair split up shortly after the accident. She added 'I thought I was about 22, I still cannot remember my childhood, going to school or my oldest friends.' Ms Emptage has now met the firefighters at Swalwell Community Fire Station, Gateshead. The crew spent over an hour cutting her free from the wreckage of her car, and saving her life four years ago. When she walked into the station she recognised three members of the crew, only to be told that they were the people who rescued her. She said: 'This whole time I believed I had been alone that night without any real human contact but it all came flooding back to me when I saw their faces.' Ms Emptage said it had been a huge comfort to learn she had not been alone after the crash. She said: 'I wanted to meet the firefighters who came to my rescue that night. I wanted to say a huge thank you, I owe them my life.' Watch manager Mark Westgarth, the Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service officer in charge at the incident, said: 'We vividly remember this crash. Ms Emptage thought she was still a 22-year-old woman when she woke up and forgot a decade of memories . It took firefighters more than an hour to cut the former model free from the wreckage of her car after the crash . Ms Emptage has made a full physical recovery and is driving again, but can only remember life at 22 . 'As we removed the roof of the car to gain access to Candace, crew members sat inside and talked to her throughout the rescue. 'She was losing a lot of blood and her lower leg was trapped by the buckled metal caused by the impact to the front end of the car.' Ms Emptage has undergone months of intensive physiotherapy and speech therapy and still has no feeling down the right hand side of her body, but has now began driving again. She says she has a good relationship with her daughter, despite still being unable to remember her growing up. The 1990s was the decade that saw the Spice Girls explode into the charts, achieving their first number one with Wannabe in 1996 and coining the era of Girl Power. This was also the year that Prince Charles and Princess Diana got divorced, with Princess Diana losing the HRH title. Music was a key part of the decade and saw the rise and fall of popular boy band Take That, charted by many teenagers' tears. Robbie Williams spectacularly left the band in 1995, causing bitter disappointment among young fans. A year later the band split up, causing further devastation, and a helpline had to be launched for dedicated Take That followers who were filmed in floods of tears after learning the news. In the 1990s  mad cow disease became the latest health scare. The disease in cattle, known as BSE, had been around for decades but scientists made a link between this strain and a similar version of the disease in humans known as CJD. This led to the European Union banning exports of British beef. This ban would last 10 years. British football suffered a dismal blow during the 1990s. In Euro 1996 England lost to Germany in the semi-finals on penalties. However it was also the time for advancement in technology. Most homes began to get the internet in 2009 and interest in space exploration grew with the launch of the Hubble Telescope, which is still orbiting the earth today. In fashion the 90s were the era when wearing sportswear, whatever the occasion, became the desired look. Adidas trousers, Kappa jackets and Umbro trainers were high in the fashion stakes, along with caps and mood rings - designed to change colour to show if wearers were feeling a range of emotions from happy, stressed and jealous. And if you weren't wearing sportswear you were likely to be wearing denim, shorts, jackets, jeans - and on many occasions, all at the same time. Friends, the American sitcom, was also key to the culture of teenagers growing up in the 90s. The show attracted a dedicated following and also saw the advent of 'the Rachel haircut', following Jennifer Aniston's popularity in the show. The Spice Girls were popular in the 90s, scoring their first number one with Wannabe and later, Too Much . Waking up to the world in 2010 . When Candace Emptage woke up in 2010 she would have noticed some drastic changes, as well as similarities in the music industry from the 1990s she remembered. Take That had reformed and in 2010 Robbie Williams decided to rejoin the band. However the industry were changing. The XFactor had been running for six years and was dominating the charts, with winner Matt Cardle at number one with Collide for three weeks. Justin Bieber had also risen to popularity, releasing his first album. Swine flu, rather than mad cow disease, was the main health issue of the year, but cases had started to come to an end in 2010. England also saw a repeat performance of defeat on the football ground. The team again suffered were beaten by Germany, knocked out in the final 16 of the 2010 World Cup.","Candace Emptage was in a car when she crashed into an ambulance .

"A Rolex watch worth nearly $7,000 bought for former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell by a man seeking government assistance for a business venture was passed Thursday among jurors in the politician's corruption trial. Businessman Jonnie Williams testified that buying the watch was a mistake, but that he did so at the behest of McDonnell's wife. He also admitted trying to help McDonnell with financial problems while he was in office. 'It was a bad decision on my part to buy that watch when she asked for it,' Williams said. 'I shouldn't have had to buy things like that to get the help I needed.' Scroll down for video . On trial: Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, center left, leaves the federal courthouse in Richmond Wednesday after testifying on the third day of the former Governor and his wife Maureen's corruption trial . The watch was passed to the jury, where each juror briefly inspected it. Williams said he bought the watch at a California jewelry store for between $6,000 and $7,000. Candid testimony from Williams also included pictures of the former governor behind the wheel of the entrepreneur's Ferrari during a free vacation at his lake house, as well as an admission of loans and an illegal stock transfer he almost made that to ease McDonnell's financial worries after a real estate deal went south. Williams testified that . Maureen McDonnell made a comment about admiring his Rolex. He said . he took it off and handed it to her for a closer look. 'She said, 'I'd really like to get one of these for the governor,' Williams recalled. He said he asked if she wanted him to buy one and she said, 'Yes, that would be nice.' Maureen . McDonnell gave the watch to her husband as a Christmas present. It is . engraved 'Robert F. McDonnell, 71st Governor of Virginia.' The watch is an important piece of evidence because it represents a tangible chunk of the more than $165,000 in secret gifts and loans prosecutors say Bob McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, received from Williams. Admitted to bribing the governor: Jonnie Williams (right) leaves the federal courthouse in Richmond, Va., after testifying . Other monetary gifts and loans can't be presented in court for jurors to hold, although many documents and photos have been shown on courtroom video screens. Photos of Bob McDonnell behind the wheel of the Italian sports car were also shown to the jury during Williams' testimony. Williams testified that Maureen McDonnell, who also is charged in the 14-count indictment, was admiring the car shortly before the vacation and asked if any like it were available at the lake house. Williams said no. 'She said, 'It would be nice. We never get to do things like this,' Williams said. He said he then had the car delivered. Bobby McDonnell, one of the former first . couple's five children, testified Wednesday that he and his siblings . goaded their father into driving the Ferrari. Bob McDonnell had not . driven himself anywhere since becoming governor and the kids thought it . would be amusing, the 22-year-old son said. Also accused: Former First Lady Maureen McDonnell, center, leaves the federal courthouse Wednesday after testifying . Williams also testified that he and Bob McDonnell discussed a possible secret transfer of Star Scientific stock to the governor so he could borrow money against it to ease money problems he was having with real estate investments. Williams, formerly the chief executive officer of Star Scientific, said he wanted to keep the deal just between the two of them because he thought it was wrong. 'It could be violating laws. I don't know that. It could be,' he said. 'I didn't want anyone to know I was helping the governor financially with his problems while he was helping my company,' Williams said. He said that when he told McDonnell he wanted to keep the deal secret, the governor 'said that was fine with him.' Williams said he ultimately concluded he couldn't transfer the stock without disclosing it to federal regulators. According to prosecutors, Williams ended up making a $50,000 loan instead. A prosecutor asked Williams if he bought gifts for the McDonnells because they were friends. 'The McDonnells are not my personal friends,' Williams said. 'I thought it was good for my company.'","Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell and his wife face more than a dozen corruption charges .

"General Motors has issued another recall - this time for vehicles that could possibly catch fire without their engines even running. This latest recall is for a group of SUVs to fix power window switches that can catch fire. GM has already issued dozens of recalls for defects this year alone to set a company record. The problem is so serious that GM is telling customers to park the SUVs outdoors until they are repaired because they could catch fire when left unattended, according to a recent court filing. Recalled: A trio of unsold 2006 Buick Rainier sports utility vehicles sits in front of a Buick dealership, the vehilces have been recalled for a third time to fix power window switches that can catch fire . The very same SUVs were originally part of recall a June 30 announcement that covered 7.6 million vehicles. It covers about . 189,000 vehicles in North America, mainly from the 2006 and 2007 model . years. Models affected include the Chevrolet TrailBlazer, GMC Envoy, . Buick Rainier, Isuzu Ascender and Saab 97-X. GM is advising people to leave them outside until parts are ready in October, at the earliest. The automaker also has ordered its dealers to stop selling the SUVs as used cars until they are fixed. The beleagured automaker is in the midst of the biggest safety crisis in its history, touched off by the delayed recall of 2.6 million older small cars to fix faulty ignition switches. It has issued a record 60 recalls this year covering nearly 29 million vehicles. Before this year, GM had been reluctant to issue recalls, at times opting for lower-cost fixes for safety problems. It's been fined $35 million by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for lapses in reporting the ignition switch problems, which it blames for at least 13 deaths. After the ignition switch debacle, GM did a companywide safety review, appointed a new global safety chief and pledged to recall cars quickly. The SUV problem first appeared early in 2012 when NHTSA began investigating consumer complaints of fires in the driver's-door switches that control power windows. Also prone to risk: The 2006 Chevy TrailBlazer SS sport utility vehicle could also spontaneously burst into flames . At first, GM tried to address the issue with a 'service campaign,' where it sent letters to owners telling them that water can find its way into the switches, causing rust that can result in short circuits, overheating and possibly fires. The campaign, which wasn't a recall, extended the warranty and offered service only to vehicles that exhibited the problems. It was limited to 20 states and Washington, D.C., where salt is used to clear roads in the winter. But in August of 2012, under government pressure, GM recalled 278,000 of the SUVs in the cold-weather states and offered extended warranties to the rest of the country. NHTSA kept investigating, and 10 months later, GM expanded the recall nationwide. By then, NHTSA and GM had received 242 complaints, including 28 about fires. There were no injuries. In one complaint filed with NHTSA from October of 2008, a woman reported that the alarm sounded while her 2006 TrailBlazer was parked in her driveway. When she looked outside, it was in flames. Firefighters put out the blaze and told her it started in the driver's door. 'The fire burned the entire driver's side of the vehicle, a portion of the front passenger seat and the roof,' she wrote. People filing complaints are not identified by the agency. The fix used by GM last year was to put a protective coating around the window switch circuit boards, which is less costly than replacing the switches. But starting this April, GM received complaints that the switches malfunctioned in SUVs that had been repaired. So in June, it decided to do the third recall and replace all of the switches. 'We are recalling them because the fix that we put in did not work,' spokesman Alan Adler said Thursday. 'We're taking care of it. We're doing the right thing.' Initially GM tried the service campaign because number of incidents was low, he said. It was limited to the cold-weather states because salty water made the switches corrode quickly and incidents were few in warmer states, Adler said. Letters notifying owners about the SUV recall should be mailed soon. Owners will get a second letter sometime from October to December telling them when parts are available to fix the vehicles.","The automaker has recalled Chevrolet TrailBlazer, GMC Envoy, Buick Rainier, Isuzu Ascender and Saab 97-X models made in 2006 and 2007 .

"Jane Cole, 56, knew that The Gambia in Western Africa had a reputation for being a hotbed of holiday romances between young local men and oilder British women. But when she decided to take a break there with her friend Vanessa in 2005, she never thought she'd find herself caught up in one. 'I'm quite worldly-wise,' said Jane, from Rothwell, who considered herself too sensible to get embroiled with a younger man. Scroll down for video . Holiday love turned sour: Michael wooed Jane when she visited The Gambia on holiday with a friend while he was working in a local bar, but after they married she realised he wasn't quite the person she thought . But then she met Michael, a 28-year-old Nigerian bartender, and his charming, attentive nature drew her in immediately. Michael quickly made it clear he wanted more than just a one-night stand while she was on holiday in the country. He wanted a relationship. 'I was completely sucked in,' said Jane. When Michael proposed, Jane decided to keep it a secret from her younger sister Tracy, knowing she would disapprove. Instead, she flew to The Gambia and married him, leaving Tracy to call her a fool. Quickly, Jane began to see that she might have been right. Michael said he wanted to move into Jane's house with her in the UK, even though she had set her heart on a new life in The Gambia, as they had discussed. Nonetheless, she loved him, so she agreed. But as soon as the couple arrived in the UK, Jane began to question Michael's loyalty, especially when he began disappearing for long periods. After calling a number that appeared frequently on his phone bill, she reached a woman with whom Michael had been having a relationship for six years. 'When I confronted Michael he just admitted it and laughed. ""People laugh when they see us together,"" he said. I was devastated. My self-confidence sunk to an all-time low. He had drained me of everything, both financially and emotionally.' 'I blamed myself for being foolish and falling for it. I'm supposed to be intelligent but I never had an inkling. 'I believed everything he said. And if he had told me the woman was just a friend, I'd still have believed him.' Tracy admits worrying that her sister might take her own life, because Michael had robbed her of everything. But Jane is not alone when it comes to confident tricksters scamming women in matters of the heart on holiday. Around 1,000 British people are victims of dating scams each year, according to the Office of National Statistics. Love at first sight? When Jeanette, from Whitby, met Rudy Sloot while on holiday in Sorrento, she was utterly charmed, but when he came to live with her in Yorkshire she saw his true colours . In 2004, a smooth-talking gentleman named Rudi Sloot began speaking to widow Jeanette Styles, 56, from Whitby, while in Sorrento, Italy. Handsome and polite, he told her he worked as an undercover agent in the White House. 'I fell for him. He seemed lovely. He came to see me in England and never left. It felt like we'd been together for years,' said Jeanette. But before she knew it, Rudi was talking her into buying him £17,000 cars and loaning him money, always promising to pay her back but never doing it. One night, when he became aggressive, she called the police. They came and arrested him and revealed he was a wanted man, on the run from Interpol for committing fraud and theft all over the world. 'I felt emotionally betrayed,' said Jeanette. 'It was a lot to deal with and I get quite emotional when I think about it. I don't think I'll ever get over it.' Jeanette is now rebuilding her life with her new partner Adrian, a local chef, and Rudy is in jail, but she has been left with the scars of her ordeal with the man who called himself 'Rudi Sloot'. Young love? Alanah Longshore, 19, from Sterling in Scotland, was just 16 when she began an internet relationship with a man named Jan who lived in Marmaris, Turkey . Alanah Longshore, 19, from Sterling in Scotland, was just 16 when she began an internet relationship with a man named Jan who lived in Marmaris, Turkey, a resort in which she often holidayed with her family. The pair began chatting in a forum dedicated to the destination, and finally met in 2010, when she returned with her mother and a family friend. As soon as she saw him Alanah knew he was the one. 'I felt my heart melt. He was perfect,' she said. They grew close immediately, and when she flew back to Scotland she told her mother she had decided to emigrate to Turkey to live their with her new boyfriend. Despite warnings from family and friends, Alanah returned to Marmaris in 2011, but her relationship with Jan soon soured, with money running out and Jan spending more time out of the house, leading Alanah to believe he was having an affair. When he became physically violent towards her Alanah fled home, where she discovered Jan was a serial philanderer, moving from British woman to British woman, and frequently getting them - Alanah included - pregnant. Abusive correspondence followed, including one message in which Jan said he wished that she and their unborn baby die in childbirth, and now Alanah is now seeking legal advice to ensure her young son is safe from his father, who has threatened to bring him back to Turkey. Love in a warm climate: Valerie met Marco in 1999 in Turkey, but after three years with him she discovered he had fathered a child with another woman during their relationship . Valerie Bamping, 60, a sales manager from Newark, says her 'holiday love rat', also from Marmaris,  cheated her out of some £42,000. Ergan, who called himself Marco, was a jeweller who began pursuing Valerie in 1999, when she was holidaying in Turkey alone. He took her out for meals, paid her lots of attention, and gave her jewellery he told her he had made himself. Over three years she gave him plenty of money and bought him a motorbike, always giving one excuse or another about why he couldn't pay her back just yet. She became disillusioned with him and broke up the relationship, only to discover he had fathered a child with his common law Turkish wife while they had been together, and that he had, in total, nine children with three different women. 'I used to be so trusting,' she said. 'Now I'm much more sceptical about everything.'

"Police are searching for an Ohio State University football player who went missing after going out for a walk. Defensive tackle Kosta Karageorge told his roommate in Columbus that he was leaving for a late stroll on Tuesday and has not been seen since. The former wrestler who is now a walk-on for the Buckeyes failed to turn up to his team's practice today ahead of their game against Michigan on Saturday. He is one of 24 seniors who will be recognized as part of their final home game. Defensive tackle Kosta Karageorge, 22,  told his roommate in Columbus that he was leaving for a late stroll on Tuesday and has not been seen since. The 22-year-old's sister Sophia told The Columbus Dispatch there had been some 'extenuating circumstances' that may have caused him to be upset. Karageorge's family are also concerned that he may be feeling the side-effects of a number of sports-related concussions, the latest of which he suffered last month. 'He never misses practice,' Sophia said. 'I've seen him go to wrestling practice with a broken foot. I've seen him sick as a dog go to practice. He's always on schedule. He always has somewhere where he checks in. 'We’re very concerned that he’s not himself and that he maybe doesn’t know what’s going on.' Authorities traced the player's phone nearby, but were unable to retrieve it. He does not have a car on campus and he wasn't on his motorbike, leading authorities to believe he took public transport or is still on foot. Karageorge's family are also concerned that he may be feeling the side-effects of a number of sports-related concussions, the latest of which he suffered last month . Karageorge played in one game this year, against Penn State. He was credited with one assisted tackle. Sophia also told the paper that he does not have his identification on him because his girlfriend has his wallet. The athlete is 6ft 5in, weighs 285 pounds and has a shaved head. The athlete was a wrestler for the university before he started as a walk-on defensive tackle. He has played one game this season against Penn State .","Kosta Karageorge, 22, told his roommate that he was going for a walk .

"A fifth of young married Brits have admitted removing their wedding ring before going out with friends or after a row with their partner, new research has revealed. While both men and women are now more likely to wear a wedding ring than previous generations, those under 40 are also more likely to remove it, the study of 2,000 married couples showed. The most common reasons people gave for removing their rings were that they felt they got more attention from the opposite sex without a ring, that he ring was uncomfortable and that they were cross with their other half and wanted to make a point. A fifth of young married Brits have admitted to removing their wedding ring before going out with friends or after a row with their partner . One in eight said thought they would be judged as 'boring' if people knew they were married while more than a third blamed it on work and said they had a better chance of winning business if they didn't wear a band. Men were most likely to take their ring off before socialising while women were more likely to remove their after a fight. But more than eighty per cent of those men had been caught by their wives and only half of those had managed to talk their way out of it. The research which polled 2,000 married couples was commissioned by Slater & Gordon as part of their annual marriage study. Kaleel Anwar, family lawyer at Slater & Gordon, said: 'We often have clients who have been frustrated by their partner's reluctance to wear a ring, particularly in certain circumstances. I have dealt with a lot of clients whose relationships breakdown because of a lack of trust between them. 'As wearing a wedding ring has become more popular it seems that couples are more likely to take offence or consider it a sign of infidelity if someone refuses. More men than ever before have a wedding band and this research shows that women like this but unfortunately rings are easily removed and this can cause trust issues and confusion among couples. Men were most likely to take their ring off before socialising while women were more likely to remove their after a fight . 'I have had men coming in saying they have caught their wife not wearing her ring so it isn't just men who are guilty. But it is often hard for people to understand why someone would remove a ring without a very legitimate reason.' Despite this both men and women under the age of 40 attached more significant to wearing a wedding band and were also more likely to be hurt if their partner refused to wear one than older generations. Unlike their fathers and grandfathers younger men see wearing a wedding band as an important part of their marriage . And unlike their fathers and grandfathers younger men see wearing a wedding band as an important part of their marriage commitment and are 27 per cent more likely to wear a band than over 40s. The change in trend for seems to have been driven by women who place more emphasis on their partner wearing a ring and 28 per cent said they would find it disrespectful if their partner refused or took it off. A fifth of women under 40 said they thought a man who didn't wear a ring didn't take his marriage as seriously and a quarter said it would make them suspicious. In comparison older women didn't mind if their husband chose not to wear one and thought it was less important than wearing one themselves. More than a third of married couples under 40 said that they would be more assured that their partner wouldn't cheat on them if they wore a ring as it would be a reminder of their commitment. Kaleel Anwar, family lawyer at Slater & Gordon said: 'In the modern age 'double rings' are clearly more popular than ever before but it's worrying that younger people are placing so much emphasis on jewellery. A ring isn't going to stop a relationship falling apart and couples shouldn't rest easy that they are in a happy relationship just because their partner wears a ring. 'The ring is just a symbol of love and commitment, a materialistic symbol. It won't stop someone straying and essentially a ring comes off very easily.' One in ten said they thought their wedding ring was often seen as a 'challenge' by the opposite sex with men saying they felt they got more attention from women after they started wearing a wedding band while women said they got less attention once they started wearing a wedding ring. But nearly two thirds said that other people saw the ring and respected the fact that it meant they were in a committed relationship.","Married Brits say they remove ring to get more attention from opposite sex .

"'A dog is for life, not just for Christmas' is the saying coined by the Dogs Trust 35 years ago to stop people buying puppies on a whim during the festive season, only to give them up halfway through the new year when they realised they couldn't handle the responsibility. But these newborn four puppies didn't even make it to Boxing Day before being abandoned. Luckily, however, they were found before it was too late, discovered huddling up together in a battered old shoe box around the back of a branch of Lidl the supermarket in Canterbury, Kent. Found by a member of the public, the two girls and two boys have now been taken in by the Dog's Trust and been named after pantomime characters to mark the season in which they were born: Prince Charming, Cinderella, Snow White and Buttons. The four puppies, found in an old slipper box behind a Lidl in Canterbury, Kent, were named Prince Charming, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and Buttons, after pantomime characters . 'They were found early morning around the back of Lidl's. We know absolutely nothing about the owner. It could be an unplanned litter or a breeder who has failed to sell them' The crossbreed puppies were initially taken to the vet to check over before being taken in by the charity, and are now recovering well from the ordeal. Dogs Trust Canterbury Rehoming Centre manager, Adam Levy, said: 'It really is a  bit of a miracle that the puppies survived after being so callously dumped in  the cold at such a young age. 'We think the puppies were one or two days old  when they were dumped. They have been in our care for a week now and their eyes  still aren't open. 'They were found early morning around the back of Lidl's. We know absolutely  nothing about the owner. It could be an unplanned litter or a breeder who has  failed to sell them. 'Our centre looks after thousands of abandoned and unwanted dogs every year,  but it still shocks us to think that someone could just abandon these helpless  puppies without a care if they lived or died. 'They will have to be hand reared for the next three weeks. This takes a lot of  care and at the moment it is being shared out between four of the staff.' The puppies have been hand-reared by Dogs Trust staff since Christmas . 'The biggest problem is that they learn so much from their mums, like how to deal with other dogs. We can't replace that but we will put them with a mother figure in the future' Staff will bottle-feed the puppies every hour throughout the night to give them  the best possible chance of survival but things are looking good for the  crossbreed pups. Mr Levy said: 'Their behaviour was slightly difficult at first but they have  settled down now and are becoming used to human contact. It is always touch and  go with pups at this age but they're all feeding well. 'The biggest problem is that they learn so much from their mums, like how to  deal with other dogs. We can't replace that but we will put them with a mother  figure in the future. 'It's hard to tell what breed they are. They have brown patches which look like  they could be part Jack Russell but they also look quite Staffy. What we do  know is that they are crossbreeds and it will probably become clearer as they  grow.' The puppies are not out of danger yet but things are looking positive for their  recovery. Dogs Trust Canterbury will continue to care for the canine casualties  until they are ready to find loving new homes in the coming months. Dogs Trust CEO, Clarissa Baldwin, said: 'This year sees the 35th anniversary of  Dogs Trust's iconic slogan ""A dog is for life, not just for Christmas"", and  sadly it's as true today as when it was first coined. 'Every year we see a  number of dogs handed into our rehoming centres in the days and weeks around  Christmas when the appeal of a cute puppy has worn off. 'It seems that people are still giving puppies as Christmas presents without  considering the long term ramifications. Dogs can provide a world of happiness  and enjoyment, and we urge anyone considering a new addition to the family to  think it through properly and care for the dogs for its' entire life.' 'Every year we see a number of dogs handed into our rehoming centres in the days and weeks around Christmas when the appeal of a cute puppy has worn off' The puppies were found around the back of the supermarket in a battered old shoe box by a member of the public . She added: 'These little puppies are now in excellent hands at Dogs Trust Canterbury who  will do all they can to ensure a suitable and loving home is found for them'  Dogs Trust cares for over 16,000 stray and abandoned dogs each year for a  variety of reasons, including those that have become unwanted gifts. Staff will be working around the clock looking after the 1,500 dogs that are  based in their 18 rehoming centres across the UK and one in Dublin at any one  time.","Crossbreed puppies were found in Canterbury, Kent, by member of public .

"Pele, who is in a Sao Paulo hospital for treatment for a urinary tract infection, has been moved to a special care unit hospital wing.

All time great: Over the course of his career he scored 1281 goals in 1363 games, including 72 goals in 92 World Cup games . Jose Fornos Rodrigues, Pele's personal aide, said Pele was 'completely fine' and the move was primarily to protect his privacy. 'He was uncomfortable with so many people coming. It'll be quieter now,' Rodrigues said by telephone. Pele was discharged from the same hospital on Nov. 13 after undergoing surgery to remove kidney stones. Doing good: An aide says Pele is 'completely fine,' and his move was due to some 'clinical instability' Pele, often called the greatest soccer player in history and whose full name is Edson Arantes do Nascimento, has suffered a long list of health problems in the past decade, including emergency eye surgery for a detached retina and a hip replacement.

"Will and Grace, Karen and Jack, Carrie and Stanford, Charlotte and Anthony... four great on-screen love stories of our time. And each completely platonic because all the men in question are gay. But these four fictional pairings between straight women and homosexual men might actually represent the most natural, mutually-beneficial, rewarding, helpful and equal human relationship that can be achieved, according to scientific research. Especially when it comes to finding a romantic partner. Characterised by a lack of both competition and ulterior motives in terms of searching for a sexual partner or giving advice, the gay-man-straight-woman relationship is win-win, say psychologists at Texas Christian University, who published their study in Evolutionary Psychology. Will & Grace title stars Eric McCormack and Debra Messing, left, and their friends Jack and Karen, played by Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally, right . Author Eric Russell and his colleagues claim the age-old unique relationship between the homosexual male and the heterosexual female serves a 'biologically adaptive function'. They say: 'Because straight women's relationships with straight men and other straight women are often tainted by deceptive motives related to mating interest or competition, respectively, we predicted that straight women would perceive mating-relevant information provided by a gay male to be more trustworthy than similar advice provided by a straight male or straight female.' Similarly, 'the sexual interest and competitive motives that may taint gay men's friendships with each other are notably absent from their relationships with straight women', said Scientific American, reporting the study. The teamcarried out two experiments with participants during the study, exploring 'a potential benefit hypothesized to be uniquely available to straight women and gay men in the context of these friendships: trustworthy mating advice'. The relationship between straight women and gay men - as seen in sitcom Will & Grace between both Will and Grace, centre, and Jack and Karen, ends - is mutually-beneficial . Experiment one revealed straight women perceive mating advice from gay men as more trustworthy than similar advice offered by a straight man or woman. Experiment two demonstrated that gay men perceive mating advice offered by a straight woman to be more trustworthy than advice offered by a lesbian woman or another gay man. The results provide initial experimental evidence that relationships between gay men and straight women may be characterized by a mutual exchange of mating-relevant benefits in the absence of romantic interest or competition.

"Edward Hernandez is 28, and his dream is to own a country farm, have a girlfriend, and drive a Jeep. It's not a huge dream, but for Edward, who lives in one of the poorest neighbourhoods in Colombia's capital city of Bogota, relies on his parents for everything, and stands at just 27 inches tall, it might as well involve building a castle made of diamonds on the moon. Until 2009, Edward and his family lived in relative obscurity. He had been angry and depressed as a child when he didn't grow while the other children or his siblings did, but he was beginning to accept his fate. Scroll down for video . World's shortest man: Edward Hernandez held the record for just six short weeks . At home: Edward says he doesn't go outside very often, because strangers tend to pick him up and ask lots of questions . He mostly stayed indoors to avoid the constant battle of people picking him up and 'kids asking silly questions', but he and his family were content running his mother Noami's textile business above their house. Their only fear was whether or not they mollycoddled him, and whether he would ever be able to cope alone if he needed his younger brothers' help even to go to the bathroom. Indeed, as one said: 'He can't go around by himself. He'd go missing. People pick him up as if he's a toy. And then, oof! we've lost Edward.' But then, in 2010, He Pingping, the world's smallest man, died in China, and the Guinness World Records people came calling. They measured him, and made him the new record-holder. Overnight, Edward became a superstar, hoisted onto the shoulders of the world's media and bounced into the spotlight. 'I was so happy I almost cried,' he said. 'I was the shortest man in the world. The only one smaller than all the other kids.' Bogota: Edward and his family live in one of the poorest neighbourhoods in the Colombian capital . The 27-inch man: Edward is considered the baby of the family, despite having several younger siblings . A keen dancer, he was thrust onto Colombian TV wearing sparkly little suits and shimmied his way to stardom. He appeared on national chat shows and was paid well for his appearances. He was given free medical care and operations for the myriad complaints he'd had since birth, sometimes in exchange for publicity and campaign backing. He even met the Colombian president at his palace. Sensing his dreams inching closer, Edward visited a Jeep dealership to test out some models, telling the salesmen he would return to buy one once more money flooded in. But, as Marco Frigatti, of Guinness World Records explained: 'We knew that the reign of Edward, as the shortest man, could be very short.' In the past: Edwards says when he was younger he used to get very angry and bad tempered when he didn't grow . The record: When Edward was named the world's smallest man he felt so very happy he almost cried . Just six weeks into Edward's record, the world's smallest teenager - Khagendra Thapa Magar, in Nepal - turned 18 and became eligible for the 'world's smallest man' category. One inch shorter than Edward, it made all the difference. He claimed the record and Edward became old news. Suddenly the attention dried up and Edward became depressed, missing the stardom he once held. 'When I first saw him I got really mad and felt in a bad mood,' Edward said. 'But my mum said I should be happy for him.' New title-holder: Khagendra Thapa Magar claimed Edward's record when he'd held it for just six weeks . Stuck in the middle: Edward says he likes being both an adult and a child, as people pick him up and kiss him . His mother said: 'He's happy being surrounded by an audience that responds to him. It makes him feel special. But but when the fuss is over he feels empty and alone. He's sad and unsettled.' Edward now works with his friend Pablo in shopping malls, selling himself on still being 'the smallest man in the world'. They make about £50 a day each. Edward still lives in the moment, but is stuck between being an adult and looking like a child, and never sure which he is. But, smiling, he says: 'I like being both a kid and an adult. That way everyone likes me. They pick me uip and kiss me. And they take me on trips.'

"Philadelphia Phillies first baseman Ryan Howard scored a run over the weekend without touching home plate – a first in the more than 150 years of Major League Baseball. Howard was called safe even after being tagged out by the Arizona Diamondbacks’ Miguel Montero because the catcher illegally blocked home plate in violation of a new rule adopted prior to this season. The rule and instant replay review, also introduced prior to the 2014 season, confirmed Howard was not provided a clear path to the plate. Umpires ruled him safe and awarded the run. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Blocked: Philadelphia Phillies first baseman Ryan Howard is clearly blocked by Arizona Diamondbacks catcher Miguel Montero . Howard began the sixth inning play standing at first base while teammate Marlon Byrd batted with two outs. Byrd popped a fly ball to shallow right field that looked to be a routine out until Arizona second baseman Didi Gregorious botched the play and watched helplessly as the ball deflected off his glove towards center field. At the same time, Howard was charging around third base and heading home – players are taught from a very young age to run out fly balls with two outs because either the inning ends with a third out or a freak play like Gregorious’ error can happen. Arizona center fielder Ender Inciarte scooped up the errant ball and fired home to try to throw Howard out. Your browser does not support iframes. Breaking the rule: Montero is seen on footage in the base path before the throw arrives . The play at the plate: Howard tries to elude Montero's tag and never actually touches home plate . Up in arms: Howard and a teammate immediately complain as the umpire waves a fist ruling Howard out . Safe: The home plate umpire awarded Howard the run after a replay review confirmed Montero blocked the plate . Montero clearly caught the ball before Howard reached home plate, but he blocked Howard’s path to the plate before he had the ball – in violation of the new rule. ‘The catcher may not block the pathway of a runner attempting to score unless he has possession of the ball. If the catcher blocks the runner before he has the ball, the umpire may call the runner safe,’ an explanation of the rule on MLB’s website says. The rule was adopted prioro to this season after star San Francisco Giants catcher buster Posey suffered a severe concussion last season on a similar play where he blocked the plate but was run over by the base runner. Howard tried to elude Montero but was tagged out. He immediately threw his arms in the air in disgust, and Phillies manager Ryne Sandberg trotted out to call for a replay review. Montero was found by replay technicians in New York to have broken the rule, Howard was called safe and the run was awarded to give Philadelphia a 3-2 lead. The Phillies eventually beat the Diamondbacks 4-2.","Philadelphia Phillies first baseman Ryan Howard was tagged out by Arizona Diamondbacks catcher Miguel Montero .

"One of Sydney's popular shopping precincts has been listed in the top five expensive places in the world to rent as retail space. This was unveiled in the 2014-15 edition Cushman and Wakefield's Main Streets Across the World survey,  showing Australia's Pitt Street Mall jumped from eighth to fifth place since the last 2013-14 report. Sydney is placed after New York's Upper 5th Avenue which is the costliest destination in the world followed by Hong Kong's Causeway Bay, Avenue des Champs-Elysees of Paris and London's New Bond Street. One of Sydney's popular shopping precincts - Pitt Street Mall - has been listed in the top five expensive places in the world to rent as retail space . This was unveiled in the 2014-15 edition Cushman and Wakefield's 'Main Streets Across the World' survey, showing Australia's Pitt Street Mall jumped from eighth to fifth place since the last report . With a growth of 25 per cent in rental costs over the past year at Pitt Street, this is the second most significant increase in the Asia-Pacific region after Bejing's CBD recorded 26.4 per cent. The report, released about two weeks ago, sourced the dramatic rise of rent on Sydney's prominent shopping area to 'a large influx of international retailers signing new leases in the last six months and taking up large space'. 'This was generally through the amalgamation of several smaller stores, which in turn significantly reduced the supply of traditional 200 square metre units,' the report continued. The report further found Pitt Street Mall rents cost US$1,016 (about AUS$1,185) per square foot, which is more expensive than well-known shopping districts such as Milan's Via Montenapoleone and Tokyo's Ginza. The prominent Avenue des Champs-Elysees in Paris retained its third place in the list of expensive retail spaces around the world . Hong Kong's famous Causeway Bay , ranked first last year, dropped to second place in this year's report . Rents at New York's Upper Fifth Avenue, which was placed second in last year's report, reached a record US$3,500 (about AUS$4,085) per square foot per year. Hong Kong's Causeway Bay saw a fall of 6.8 per cent in rents from first place to second. Avenue des Champs-Elysees in Paris retained its third place as well as London’s New Bond Street in fourth. The Cushman and Wakefield survey ranks 330 locations across 65 countries around the world. Pitt Street Mall has seen the addition of international fashion brands including Zara and Uniqlo pop-up store. Multi-billion dollar fashion chain H&M also announced in September they will open its second Sydney store in Pitt Street's Glasshouse centre in mid-2015.

"A relaxed and sensibly-dressed Prince Anne attended the Six Nations International Rugby Union Match between Scotland and Wales at Murrayfield  today. The Princess Royal, 64, looked cheerful in a green tweed double-breasted coat and matching trousers. A long-time supporter of Scotland, she chatted to members of both teams before kick-off at 3pm at the Edinburgh stadium. Princess Anne meets the Wales and Scotland rugby teams before Six Nations kick off in Edinburgh today . The royal wore a green tweed double breasted jacket and matching trousers at Murrayfield stadium . Anne, who has a long relationship with the sport as a patron on Scottish Rugby Union and Gloucestershire Rugby Football Union, was introduced to both sides . She enjoyed some pre-match small talk with Wales's Jamie Roberts. Then Anne, who wore a matching green polo neck under her jacket, also talked to Scotland's Geoff Cross and seemed to rib him about his beard. Ever practical, she wore her hair back in its signature up-do, kept her hands warm with leather gloves and made sure she could walk steadily across the pitch in sturdy black shoes. She laughed and talked to Scotland's Geoff Cross as well as Wales' Jamie Roberts before 3pm kick-off . The royal has an added attraction to the sport as her son Peter Phillips also played for Scotland under-18s while he was at Gordonstoun school in Scotland. Meanwhile her son-in-law Mike Tindall is a former England rugby player. He and Zara are close to Anne and rent a home on her 730-acre Gatcombe Park estate.","The Princess Royal, 64, chatted to team members before 3pm kick-off .

"A six-month-old baby and a man in his 20s are dead after what authorities believe is a police-assisted murder-suicide. The unidentified man stabbed young Roberto Varela to death and charged at Folsom, California police with a knife, giving the officer no choice but to shoot the suspect dead, cops said. Arela Aguilar, the baby’s mother and the man’s aunt, was also stabbed but is expected to survive, said police. Grisly: This woman was led away crying and covered in blood, she has not been identified . Neighbors claims the two have had a frosty relationship that recently took a turn for the worse as they constantly argued in the days leading up to the tragedy. Aguilar and the man are said to have increasingly been at odds, and were heard early Thursday morning shouting at each other loudly enough to have been heard by neighbors. The argument spilled out into the neighborhood about 12 hours later, around 2.30 p.m., when neighbors say they heard shouting and gunfire. ‘I heard ... gunshots and a lady screaming,’ James McClean told the Folsom Telegraph. ‘A whole bunch of police cars showed up.’ Aguilar was soon seen on the grass in front of her apartment holding a wound and screaming in pain, neighbors told the Sacramento Bee. Sad: This stuffed teddy bear and candle were left outside the home where the child lived . Evidence: Possessions were seen outside the home, near where the suspect was shot dead . Where it happened: The Folsom home where the disturbing scene unfolded . First responders soon arrived to take care of the ailing woman and the man came charging out of the home and at cops. ‘Then a police officer showed up and a guy came running out and running at the cop and yelling ‘f-you’ … the cop shot him,’ Bryan Thomas told the Telegraph. Police tried to revive the man but were unsuccesful. ‘We came outside and saw all the commotion, them trying to resuscitate the guy,’ Joshua Smith told KMAX. Another woman, covered in blood, was soon led away from the home in tears, footage showed. The dead toddler was not found by investigators until some time later, KMAX reported. ‘That’s more shocking than the whole thing, that a baby was involved,’ added Smith. Investigators are working to determine exactly what happened, but believe the man’s intention was to die from police gunfire. The investigation remains ongoing.","Six-month-old Roberto Valera was stabbed dead and his mother Arela Aguilar was injured .

"The much-maligned security perimeter at New York’s busiest airport has failed again after two kayakers claim they washed ashore without being detected by police. Anthony Giglio, of suburban Inwood, and Jordan Crooms, of Queens, were kayaking through Jamaica Bay Friday evening when their kayak rolled over and they swam to a pier on the property of John F. Kennedy International Airport near a scant-used runway. No one knew the pair, both 21, was there until they found a construction worker to call for help because there are no security patrols at night, critics claim. No other options: Jordan Crooms (left) and Anthony Giglio (right) claim they had no choice but to go to airport land after their Kayak rolled and they were left with only one paddle . Crooms told the New York Post that they were ‘just kayaking at night’ when their three-man vessel rolled over and they lost two paddles. ‘We had one paddle left,’ Crooms continued. ‘We were going toward the closest spot to shore.’ The two men found a dock just off runway 41, and made their way to safety without being detected by the $100million security system in place to thwart such breaches, sources told the paper. ‘We were almost drowning. We couldn’t hang onto the boat, and we were getting pulled under and out,’ Giglio told WCBS. ‘We found a construction worker, and he said, ‘are you guys alright? Thank god you’re alive.’ Where they landed: On this pier just off runway 41 on the airport's southern shore . On the water: JFK Airport is bordered to the south by Jamaica Bay, a waterway with boaters and other locals looking to escape the hustle and bustle of the city . The same runway was breached only two . years ago when a jetskier ran out of gas, swam to shore, scaled an . eight-foot fence and walked across two runways into the airport seeking . help, according to the station. That man also eluded detection by the perimeter ‘fence’s motion sensors. ‘You’ve got a system that is supposed to provide protection, and what happened?’ Counterterrorism expert William Vorlicek asked the station. ‘Once again a perimeter security breach at JFK Airport raises serious concerns about the Port Authority’s Perimeter Intrusion Detection System,’ a Port Authority police union spokesperson told the Post, ‘a system the PAPBA believes is a failure.’ The Port Authority insisted to WCBS that ‘kayakers did not breach the secure airfield. They were seeking help in a restricted water area and at a light pier. Both men were treated for hypothermia at a nearby hospital and charged with trespassing.","Anthony Giglio and Jordan Crooms, both 21, made their way to shore after their kayak tipped Friday night in Jamaica Bay .

"To whom does this Alaskan Klee Kai belong? It is said that after a while dogs begin to resemble their owners... so can you figure out to which celebrities these cute pups belong? Mother-of-two Peaches Geldof, stylist Gok Wan, and models Daisy Lowe and Elle Macpherson are just some of the stars who let legendary London-based dog photographer Gerrard Gethings pap their pet as part of a new exhibition to raise money for animal charity Dogs Trust. Producer Mark Ronson, Blur bassist Alex James, model Yasmin Le Bon, designer Henry Holland, former guitarist with The Fall Brix Smith-Start and The Saturdays' Vanessa White also took their dogs into the studio to have their turn in front of the camera. The Feeling frontman Dan Gillespie Sells, Paul Weller's daughter Leah, fashion expert Caryn Franklin, designer Charlotte Olympia, actor Leo Gregory and former TOWIE star Lydia Bright also had their dogs take part in Gerrard's exhibition The Company Of Dogs. The resulting prints will be auctioned online via pet community Pets Pyjamas and be on display for one week only in Pets Pyjamas' Shoreditch headquarters. Discussing the exhibition, Gethings . said: 'Filling a gallery with fifty intimate yet oversized portraits of . dogs is a dream come true. 'My aim with the portraits is to capture the . seemingly human side of canine emotion as well as those dog-like traits . we all recognise. 'The pictures have been taken from low angles to appear . as natural as possible and are almost always focused on the eyes.' Two labradoodles pose beautifully for Gerrard Gethings... but who takes them home at the end of the shoot? Speaking to MailOnline, he explained why having dogs on set is never going to be boring: 'They rarely do exactly what you want them to and so there is an . element of chance to the results. 'You control the lighting, bring in the . dog, and then move the set up around according to the dogs behaviour.' He continued: 'They don't understand subtle direction like models, and the whole shoot . often becomes very physical. 'Their unpredictability means that you have . to try and create your own luck. Nothing is guaranteed but then when you . do get the shot it is all the more rewarding.' A Boston terrier named Cecil, Luigi the pug and Tinka the chihuahua all belong to.... This is Olive the miniature Schnauzer... but whose house does she live in? And which celebrity dogs particularly well-behaved? 'Brix Smith-Start and Yasmin Le Bon's . dogs were pretty amazing. It was apparent that they spend a lot of time . together and the dogs trust them. 'Getting three dogs to sit perfectly in . a line is much trickier than it seems but Yasmin managed this very . easily. 'Brix was just hilarious. She stood behind me with her head above . my camera, speaking to the dogs in that amazing way of hers. 'Lots of . different intonations to keep the dogs interest as she listed all the . things they were interested in - these ranged from the fishes in the sea . to the ghosts in their house. The dogs were genuinely engaged and I was . in stitches. 'Henry Holland's dog was pretty fun too but for different . reasons: my own dog Baxter became obsessed and spent the entire shoot . trying to mount the poor little thing. In the end we had to lock shut . him in the kitchen to cool down.' This beautiful Rhodesian Ridgeback is called Marlon - but what's his owner's name? Ted the Kerry Blue terrier belongs to someone who feels very at home with a microphone in his hand... Gethings' reasons for working with Pets Pyjamas and Dogs Trust were simple: 'It . was a no brainer really. I wanted to do a show with Pets Pyjamas and we . agreed that it should be for charity. 'Dogs . sharing their lives with the rich and famous and dogs yet to be homed . have been lit and photographed in the same setting' 'The . Dogs Trust have a policy which states that they never put a healthy dog . down. This alone made me want to work with them, and after meeting the . team I knew we'd made the right decision. 'Dogs . sharing their lives with the rich and famous and dogs yet to be homed . have been lit and photographed in the same setting. 'It is striking that . although the animals are physically and socially so diverse they behave . in almost exactly the same way. 'It would be difficult to guess the ones . going home with Elle Macpherson and those waiting for a new home - they . all crave human love and will all do anything for a piece of cheese.' Who dressed this dapper little French Bulldog? Socks the whippet, left, and a stunning salt and pepper miniature Schnauzer, right... but whose are they? Following a private preview, the exhibition - held at The Gallery, 81 Leonard Street, EC2A 4QS - will be open to the . public from 21 March to 29 March, 10am to 5pm. Bidding in the online . auction opens here today. Denise . Elphick, co-founder of PetsPyjamas.com, said: 'At PetsPyjamas we are . passionate supporters of Dogs Trust and truly admire photographer . Gerrard Gethings' work. 'His portraits wonderfully encapsulate the true . character and soul of each of the dogs featured. 'We are proud to have . organised this event to raise money and awareness for dogs in need and . also to showcase Gerrard's fabulous work. We hope everybody bids for . these beautiful portraits.' Who takes home this happy Maltese, left, and this serious Labrador Collie, right? This wise Golden Retriever looks like nothing will phase him... even a rough-and-tumble young family . Clarissa . Baldwin OBE, chief executive of Dogs Trust, said: 'Dogs have long been . seen as man's best friend and this exhibition is a shining example of . the beauty of our furry friends. 'It's hard for us as dog lovers to . imagine that there are so many abandoned dogs looking for new homes, and . that’s where Dogs Trust comes in. 'Dogs of all shapes and sizes can be . found at our network of rehoming centres across the country. 'We hope . that this exhibition will not only help the Dogs Trust canine stars . featured have a chance of a new start, but through the monies raised all . of the other dogs that pass through our doors each and every day.' At whom is Maggie the puggle gazing with those big puppy-dog eyes? Peggy the French Bulldog is a tiny little thing belonging to...? Whose floppy-eared King Charles Spaniel is Toffee? FOCUS ON THE EARS, NOT THE EYES,,, . With dogs, is rarely the eyes . that depict the personality. The eye thing is an old habit picked up . photographing people.The thing that best shows a dogs personality/mood . is the position of the ears. Getting the ears into a desirable position . is key. If a dog is slightly wary, which they often are on set, their . ears will go down. This doesn't make for an attractive portrait. I will . often get an assistant to leave the room and knock on the door to get . the ears to prick up. This can backfire and send the dog into fits of . barking but you work with what you have. The shoot is always quite . organic in this respect. HAVE TREATS HANDY . The sitting part is almost always . down to food. The greedier a dog is the easier it is to photograph. My . own dog is obsessed with food and will never, ever take his eyes off a . biscuit. This is the ideal scenario because dogs don't generally follow . objects with their eyes, but will move the entire head. This baby long-haired Chihuahua is Luna... but who is her owner? This way they . can be manipulated into lifting or lowering their head to the desired . position. For dogs that aren't interested in food then maybe a squeaky . toy. Absolutely anything that holds their attention can be used - but, to . be honest, I have rarely met a dog that won't play ball for a piece of . cheddar. DOWN, BOY . I would say get down low. Lie on the . floor for a dogs eye view. They look much better shot from low angles. WEAR WHITE . If you don't have professional lighting is to . simply wear something white. If you are close enough to the dog It will . reflect light into his/her eyes and can really bring a picture to life. Gerrard Gethings and his Border Terrier Baxter after a long shoot on set .

"Cheese: good. Chocolate: good. Cheesy chocolate? You have got to be kidding me. Well, no. At least, not according to the Great British Chefs, a bunch of cooking experts who have proclaimed chocolate and cheese muddled up together as the next big foodie trend of 2014. And they're not just talking chocolate cheesecake, chocolate and ricotta puddings or chocolate Philadelphia - essentially a super-creamy Nutella. They're talking Roquefort and cinnamon chocolate doughnuts, chocolate and Shropshire blue cake, goat's cheese and lemon ganache, and Port and Stilton truffles. Cheese and chocolate, served together, are set to be the next big thing in food . Masterclass: Paul A Young shared his stilton truffle recipe with foodie Pinterset fans in London . The group have been moved to rave about the pongy pairing since foodie fans on Pinterest have started sharing chocolatier Paul A Young's port and stilton truffle recipe with gusto. It may initially seem counter-intuitive, but chocolate and cheese have long been considered good plate-fellows by the professionals, and experimental molecular gastronomists including Heston Blumenthal (The Fat Duck) and Ferran Adria (El Bulli) have been celebrating the flavour pairing in dishes for some time. The discovery that chocolate and blue cheese share multiple flavour compounds led to the creation of Blumenthal's molten chocolate and blue cheese cake. And while we may wince at the idea of dunking a Snickers in a blue cheese fondue, more and more chefs are trying to bring us round to their way of thinking. Never be forced to choose between chocolate and cheese ever again when these two start appearing on menus together . Kraft and Cadbury teamed up to make Philadelphia chocolate recently . Mecca Ibrahim at Great British Chefs told MailOnline: 'Heston Blumenthal was one of the first chefs in the UK to develop blue cheese and chocolate as a pairing with his famous Molten chocolate and blue cheese cake. 'Chocolate and blue cheese share 73 flavour compounds, so there's actually a scientific reason as to why we find the mix appealing. Paul A Young has been surprising UK chocaholics with chocolate and cheese pairings for a while, particularly his best-loved being Port and Stilton truffles and goat's cheese and lemon ganache. And French Pascal Aussignac, who runs a number of award-winning restaurants in London, has created a recipe for cinnamon doughnuts filled with a unique blend of white chocolate and Roquefort cheese. Everyone knows that soft, mild cheeses such as ricotta and cream cheese go well with chocolate... but what about stronger cheeses such as Gorgonzola? David  Cameron has Niki Segnit's Flavour Thesaurus on his book shelf in Downing Street . Niki Segnit is the author of The Flavour Thesaurus, a food pairing bible that explains which flavours go well together and why. (Her comprehensive and utterly mouthwatering guide to taste was, incidentally, spotted on the Prime Minister's personal bookshelf just last week.) In her book Segnit explains that she discovered the pairing of chocolate and cheese at a Paul A Young tasting. Apprehensive at first, she said the two flavours work because of 'how comparable it is to chocolate and milk (or cream) and, further, . how the flavour notes in some good chocolate - spicy berry fruits, dried . fruits, caramels - are natural partners for cheese'. By June you'll all be sprinkling Parmesan into your chocolate mousse, just you wait. Port and Stilton truffles . INGREDIENTS . 200ml of double cream75g of golden caster sugar100g of Stilton, very mature,roughly chopped500g of 70% dark chocolate,broken into pieces75ml of tawny port200ml of watercocoa powder . METHOD . 1. To make the ganache, add the water, cream, sugar and Stilton to a pan and bring to a simmer. Place the chocolate in a large, heat-proof bowl and pour the Stilton mixture into the bowl, stirring continuously to melt the chocolate2. Mix the port into the chocolate until completely incorporated. Allow to cool then cover and place in the fridge for at least 2 hours to set3. Once set, scoop out even quantities with a teaspoon and place on some parchment paper. Coat your hands in cocoa powder and quickly roll into balls before the ganache starts to melt. Store in the fridge until ready to coat in tempered chocolate, or eat straight away. Goat's cheese and lemon ganache . INGREDIENTS . 250g of Cerney goat's cheese, or similar, ash coating removed100g of goat's curd, or full-fat cream cheese2 lemons, juiced and zested200g of golden caster sugar400g of fine white chocolate, broken into pieces40 chocolate shells300g of chocolate, tempered, for capping shells . MEASURE . 1. Measure out 150ml of water and add to a pan with the goat's cheese, goat's curd, lemon zest and juice. Bring to a simmer and cook until smooth and combined . 2.Add the sugar to the mix and stir to melt, then remove from the heat and whisk in the chocolate. Check the ganache and add a little more sugar if needed. Set aside to cool . 3.Once the ganache is tepid, transfer to a piping bag with a nozzle small enough to fit into the hole of your shells. Pipe the ganache into the shells, leaving a 2mm gap before you reach the top so you can seal the chocolate later. Leave to set for at least 6 hours, ideally overnight . 4.To cap the shells, dollop a small amount of tempered chocolate over the hole of each chocolate. Use a palette knife to scrape off any excess chocolate and allow to set for 20 minutes . 5.Alternatively, once the ganache has cooled, leave in the fridge for 2 hours to set. Once the ganache is set, scoop out even quantities with a teaspoon and place on some parchment paper. 6. Coat your hands in cocoa powder and quickly roll into balls before the ganache starts to melt. Store in the fridge until ready to coat in tempered chocolate, or eat straight away . Roquefort, cinnamon and chocolate doughnut . INGREDIENTS . Doughnut batter95ml of water30g of butter5g of sugar1 pinch of salt60g of plain flour1 egg1l of oilChocolate filling200g of white chocolate200g of Roquefort cheese, crumbledCinnamon sugar75g of caster sugar25g of ground cinnamonCognac jelly150ml of cognac50ml of water2 gelatine leavesTo plate6 cinnamon sticksMETHOD . 1. Place the water, butter, sugar and salt into a saucepan. Bring to the boil and add the flour, stirring continuously with a wooden spoon. Cook for 3-5 minutes then remove from the heat and mix in the egg . 2. Continue to beat for 2 minutes. Place in the fridge to cool and rest for 1 hour . 3. Heat some oil in a fryer or saucepan to 130-140°C. Divide the batter into 50g portions and fry for 10-15 minutes, making sure to turn and baste constantly . 4. The doughnuts will almost double in size and will become crisp and golden as they cook . 5. Mix the sugar and cinnamon together. Once the doughnuts are cooked roll them in the sugar and set aside . 6. Place the chocolate in a bowl over a pan of simmering water or melt in the microwave. Once melted, remove from the heat and add the crumbled Roquefort and stir7. To melt the chocolate break it into pieces, put it in a bowl and rest the bowl on a saucepan of simmering water over a low heat. Make sure that the water doesn't touch the bottom of the bowl . 8. Don’t mix too thoroughly; you want a few pieces of the Roquefort to add texture to the mix. Spoon the mix into a piping bag and set aside . 9. To soak the gelatine leaves, put in cold water for about four minutes . 10. Mix the cognac with the water. Soak the gelatine water, then squeeze out the excess and place in a saucepan with 50ml of the cognac mix. Melt the gelatine over a low heat then whisk into the rest of the cognac mix . 11. Pass the liquid through a sieve and put in a container in the fridge until set, which should take around 1 hour . 12. To serve, make a small hole in the bottom of each doughnut and pipe in the Roquefort mix . 13. Sprinkle some cinnamon sugar around the plate, spoon on some jelly and add the doughnut. 14. Lastly, position the cinnamon sticks across each plate . From Great British Chefs .","Great British Chefs claim this unusual pairing will be big on menus soon .

"Thanksgiving was truly a family affair for Stefan Holt, the Chicago news anchor and son of NBC Weekend anchor Lester. When his famed father spent the holiday with 25-year-old Stefan and his wife in the Windy City, the veteran newsman volunteered to help out on Black Friday if one of his son's co-workers wanted the day off. Lester, 53, is one of the biggest names on NBC's roster and before working in the Today and Nightly News studios in New York, he spent more than a decade at a local news station in Chicago. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . On-air family time: Lester Holt joined his son Stefan as he anchored the news in Chicago on Black Friday . His son Stefan followed in his footsteps, and joined the NBC family last summer. The two appeared together as co-anchors on Friday's noon broadcast for NBC 5, effectively reversing the tradition and making it a form of 'take your father to work day'. 'To say I had to pinch myself is an understatement,' the elder Holt wrote in a post for Today.com. 'The father in me was bursting with pride, while the seasoned broadcaster in me was trying to remain focused on making sure it was a solid broadcast.' Planting the seeds: Stefan, now 25, used to visit his dad on the Today show set . Face time: Lester said that Stefan has always had a passion for news . Seeing the opportunity for a feel-good segment, the duo called in for an interview by Lester's co-workers at the Today Show where they showed pictures of a young Stefan visiting his father in the newsroom, back in the day when Lester was starting out and sporting a moustache. 'Stef and I really enjoy each other, we have a good time, but at the heart of it, he's really a serious news man- I say that incredulously- he really has a passion for news and it's fun. We always kind of shared that with me,' the proud dad said. Blackmail: Lester joked that if he felt threatened by Stefan, he would release a video he took of his son doing a Gangnam style dance in the kitchen over Thanksgiving . 'I'm a little nervous because he's actually really good.' He secured a form of insurance, however, as he joked that he took an embarrassing video of Stefan dancing in the kitchen during their Thanksgiving feast. 'If he were going to try to make a move on the old man, I've got blackmail!' Lester threatened. WATCH THE VIDEO HERE .

"It's an adage as old as time itself: if you want something to taste really delicious, dump it in a vat of boiling hot oil. At least, that's always been true when it comes to cooking doughnuts, those sinfully decadent deep-fried cakes stuffed with jam and cream and toffee and goo and whatnot, averaging about 18g of fat per individual treat - an enormous 90 per cent of the recommended daily fat allowance for a woman. Until now. One (moderately) health-conscious British artisan chef has taken it upon himself to reduce the fat content in doughnuts without reducing the taste experience. And Paul Hurley, creator of Dum Dum Doughnuts, has started by cutting out the deep-fat frying altogether, choosing to bake his scrumptious morsels instead. Healthy treat? Dum Dums doughnuts are baked instead of fried so have a reduced fat content compared to regular deep-fried doughnuts . Gobble gobble: Femail's Bianca London samples a Dum Dum croissant doughnut, left, just one of the many flavours produced by the Essex-based brand, right . Speaking to MailOnline, Paul, who used to work for Dunkin' Donuts, said: 'I've been trying to create the world's best doughnut since 1997, but you can't just think about flavour, you need to also think about ethics: what people should be eating, and what they should be letting their kids eat. The Zebra:Baked croissant doughnut with chocolate buttercream with a chocolate ganacheAlmond Cream & Pistachio:Almond-infused buttercream with pistachio on topCroissant Doughnut:Raspberry preserve with homemade buttercream and fresh raspberriesKroconut:Coconut cream and chocolate ganacheRaspberry Doughnut:Raspberry preserve with subtle layer of caster sugar and neige décorChocolate Doughnut:Chocolate ganache and hazelnut;Complete with almond glazeCrème brûlée:Crème brûlée with crunchy caramel and crème pâtissièreStrawberry Doughnut:Complete with strawberry puree icingBanoffee Doughnut:Banoffee puree with custard and Dulce De Leche setting with digestive biscuit topping . Pete's Yum Yum Dum Dum:Croissant doughnut with buttercream and dulce de leche caramel with glaze . 'Since we bake rather than fry you've already halved the fat content of a regular doughnut. 'Obviously we then add things like cream and jam and chocolate which bump up the calories and fat, but it will always be lower in fat than a doughnut that's been floating in hot oil for a couple of minutes. We don't even own a deep-fat fryer! 'Our jam doughnuts will have around 6g of fat in them as opposed to the equivalent deep-fried ones which will have about 18g. And about 350kcal compared to about 450.' He continued: 'The thing is, we're all adults. We want to give people choice. But if you're going to have a treat, make it a really fabulous one.' The team at Dum Dums is comprised entirely of trained pastry chefs, and all ingredients are fresh and natural: a strawberry creme doughnut contains fresh fruit rather than E-numbers and strawberry flavouring. 'We make everything from scratch with a baking process we've developed over the past 10 years.' Dum Dums come in regular doughnut and croissant doughnut varieties, but Paul insists he isn't jumping on the cronut bandwagon. 'The concept of a croissant doughnut has been around for years - just think of the yum yum. It's only the clever name ""cronut"" that is actually new. 'One . of our doughnuts - Pete's Yum Yum Dum Dum - is a big yum yum filled . with buttercream and dulce de leche caramel with a glaze. It was . especially commissioned for Peter Andre when he asked for one.' Zebra: The chocolate and plain croissant layered treat is one of the brand's signature doughnuts . The Dum Dum Donutterie will be open at Box Park, in Shoreditch, east London, from the 25 February. The baked doughnuts will be made freshly on a daily basis and will be sold on a first come basis. The . current pop-up Donutterie at Westfield Straford City is open all week . until this Sunday. The doughnuts have been selling out every day around . 3pm. Traditional . American-style doughnuts cost £1.80 each, £6 for a box of six. Dum Dums . baked croissant doughnuts are £3 each or two for £5. Westfield: Dum Dum's pop-up doughnut shop is open in the Stratford City shopping centre until this Sunday . Reducing the fat content in something renowned for its devilishly high lard-count seldom turns out well. Low-fat crisps are toe-curlingly cardboardy, fat-free cheese has the texture of aged rubber, and mayonnaise without fat tastes more like craft glue than anything you'd fancy putting in a sandwich. So what about doughnuts? Would removing the final cooking step - namely, 'deep-fry until outer pastry layer is crackling-crisp, and inside has absorbed just enough oil to soften slightly' - be the kiss-of-death for this King of Cakes? Team Femail took a box of Dum Dums into the lab (read: back office) to do the all-important taste test.... Gooey: Dum Dum Doughnuts come in a number of different flavours and are decorated with everything from custard filling to sugar glaze . Bianca London: . 'I'm not a huge fan of doughnuts, and these ""healthy"" versions definitely didn't change my mind. They were still coated in sugar - and we all know that's the real bad guy when it comes to ingredients. 'Plus, mine was stuffed cream. Since when are cream and sugar healthy? At least if they'd put some apple sauce in there it would have seemed healthy. For 300 calories I would much rather have six apples, or even three Cadbury Freddo bars.' Martha de Lacey: .

"The 30-year-old woman charged with attempted murder after leaving her newborn son in a drain in western Sydney has been remanded in custody until December 12 for a possible bail application. The accused did not appear in Penrith Local Court during a very brief hearing before Magistrate Brian Van Zuylen. The woman, who is the daughter of a Seventh Day Adventist pastor, had been living with her aunt and uncle in the western Sydney suburb of Quakers Hill when she became pregnant and kept her condition secret for nine months. Scroll down for video . The 30-year-old woman charged with attempted murder after leaving her newborn son in a drain in western Sydney has been remanded in custody until December 12 for a possible bail application . After giving birth to a healthy baby boy at Blacktown hospital at 1am on Tuesday of last week, she discharged herself early that afternoon and, police allege, took her baby and placed him in a stormwater drain around 500m from her home. The baby was apparently put through a small opening under the concrete slab over the drain and fell the 2.5m drop to the bottom. The baby lay undisovered for five days in hot dry conditions. The woman has been refused bail and remains in a women's jail . On Sunday morning, David Otte and his daughter Hayley, heard cries coming from a drain as they were cycling near the M7 motorway. They stopped, thinking it was a trapped small animal, and then called emergency services when they saw the baby. Police from Quakers Hill Local Area Command retrieved the baby, which was wrapped in a pink striped blanket, from the drain. After giving birth to a healthy baby boy at Blacktown hospital at 1am on Tuesday of last week, she discharged herself early that afternoon and, police allege, took her baby and placed him in a stormwater drain around 500m from her home . Police from Quakers Hill Local Area Command retrieved the baby, which was wrapped in a pink striped blanket, from the drain . The baby had blood on his head and was taken to hospital where it was found he was severely dehydrated and had bleeding on the brain. Now 10 days old, the baby is in a stable condition in Westmead Hospital. A Westmead Children's Hospital spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia that the baby is in the care of Family And Community Services. Workmen on Sunday lift the 200kg concrete cover to the drain where the baby boy was dumped . On Sunday morning, David Otte and his daughter Hayley, heard cries coming from a drain as they were cycling near the M7 motorway. They alerted authorities to the baby . Doctors said the baby was able to survive in the drain because of a lack of rain causing storm water which might have drowned him, along with newborns' natural ability to survive without food or water. Police tracked down the mother and arrested her on Monday, charging her with attempted murder. Magistrate Van Zuylen said the woman has still been refused bail. Passersby outside court cried 'shame' as relatives crossed the street in Blacktown . The accused did not appear in Penrith Local Court during a very brief hearing before Magistrate Brian Van Zuylen but her family were present . She is being held in a Sydney women's prison and is expected to appear via audio visual link from jail in December. Relatives told Daily Mail Australia they had been unaware of the woman's pregnancy and did not know who the father could be. The woman's family quickly left the court on Monday, but she did not appear . The landlord of the house where the woman had been living with her extended family for at least two years said he had noticed the young woman had put on weight two or three months ago. 'I was delivering the water bill and I saw she was bigger and wearing loose clothes, but I didn't say anything. 'They are a very good family, clean. I see them with their Bibles.' Three cars were parked outside the woman's house in Blacktown . The family are members of a Seventh Day Adventist Church in western Sydney. Police are believed to still be trying to formally identify the child's father. Court documents state the child was placed in the 2.4-metre deep drain on Tuesday - less than 24 hours after he was born at Blacktown Hospital. 'The accused makes full admissions to putting the baby down the drain knowing it may kill the baby,' court documents said. Family members arrive at Blacktown Court (left) and return to their home (right) on Monday . The woman will receive a medical assessment while behind bars, the court heard. David Otte and his 18-year-old daughter Hayley were two of the four cyclists who discovered the baby in a stormwater pit off the M7 at Quakers Hill. They initially thought that the sounds were a kitten – but then Mr Otte realised that the cries were human. 'I've got two kids of my own so I know what a baby screaming sounds like,' he told The Sydney Morning Herald. 'It was so intense; you couldn't not tell it was a baby. We couldn't see it but we could hear it. It was distressed.' The drain was covered by a concrete slab which weighed over 200kg and took six people to lift, including two police officers who had arrived at the scene. 'You go through life seeing things but you never ever imagine you'll see something like this', Mr Otte, who only cycles the route once a month, said. The boy was lifted out of the drain by Senior-Constable Mark McAlister who climbed in with another officer to retrieve him. 'How could someone do it? I, myself, have kids and we're expecting a baby in a few more months so it's not good that someone's going through this and has done this to a little one,' he said.

"Jailed: Adrian Udrea, 39, pleaded guilty to rape and stealing jewellery from his vulnerable victim . A Romanian-born rapist who broke into the home of an 81-year-old woman and attacked her in her bed was jailed today for 16 years. Adrian Udrea, 39, pleaded guilty to rape and stealing jewellery from his vulnerable victim from her sheltered accommodation near Felixstowe, Suffolk. Police were called to her home on September 28 at about 2am after the woman reported the incident. Udrea, of Felixstowe, was arrested two days later and jailed at Ipswich Crown Court. Detective Chief Inspector Andy Smith said: ‘For an elderly lady to be subjected to such a horrific, degrading and vile act in her own home is beyond all comprehension. ‘We cannot praise the victim enough for the bravery and determination she has shown in such terrible circumstances. ‘Her actions in immediately reporting this abhorrent crime and the invaluable assistance she gave the enquiry team helped us to identify and arrest Udrea quickly.’ Michelle Brown, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ‘Adrian Udrea was responsible for a particularly brutal and abhorrent attack on an elderly and vulnerable victim. ‘We all like to think we are safe in our own homes and so it was terrifying for this woman to wake up in her sheltered accommodation to find she was being raped by an intruder who also stole her jewellery and other possessions.’ Sentencing: Udrea was arrested two days after the incident and jailed at Ipswich Crown Court (pictured) The victim's family said they were 'pleased with today’s sentence and just hope that we can come now come to terms with what has happened and have some kind of peace in the future'. Udrea was sentenced to 16 years for rape and four years for the burglary, to run concurrently. He denied a charge of assault causing actual bodily harm and that was left on file.","Adrian Udrea pleaded guilty to rape and stealing jewellery from victim .

"A mother was shamed into losing six stone after she needed two wizard gowns to cover her body during a visit to the Harry Potter Studios.

Two attendants had to help pin two cloaks to Marie's 20st 11lb body, and she was left feeling humiliated, saying: 'My daughter and husband looked so embarrassed and I was absolutely mortified.'

She had already found herself too big to squeeze inside the  famous blue car from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Determined to return for a better photo opportunity, Marie went home after the incident in October 2012 and immediately set to work shedding the weight she had gained since giving birth to a stillborn son in 2008 and comfort eating through the grief.

Remembering the incident, Marie said: 'I decided to go for the first photo even though I was insecure. 'We queued for ages and when we finally got to put on the wizard robes, I said to a worker jokingly: ""Have you got one big enough for me?"".' 'He said yes of course, but came back and said he didn't. 'So he got two and pinned them together on my back in front of absolutely everybody in the queue and I had to put an arm in each robe with the spare arms hanging behind me. 'My daughter and husband looked so embarrassed and I was absolutely mortified. She hugged my leg and said 'mummy it's OK' but she had gone bright red. 'I smiled for the photograph but I wanted to cry. You could also get photos of you on a broomstick and I really wanted one done but I didn't because of how silly I'd look as such a large lady on such a small stick.

Marie said: 'I'm so much happier now, and I know it's made my family happier.

But in 2013 she lost 6st 4lbs in just over a year with the help of her local Slimming World group. She added: 'I have just always been an emotional eater, but as I ate more I became more depressed.

"A witness in the Ferguson shooting case found the phrase ‘Snitches get stitches’ when he googled his own name, it has been revealed. The man, who has not been named, told of his fear of describing what happened on the day black teenager Michael Brown was shot dead by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri this summer. His comments emerged after prosecutors released some 4,700 pages of reports following the grand jury’s decision not to indict the white officer. A witness feared giving evidence about the day teenager Michael Brown (right) was shot dead by police officer Darren Wilson (left) in Ferguson, Missouri this summer . The city was engulfed in serious civil unrest following the jury’s decision on Monday. According to the Los Angeles Times, one of the witnesses told investigators he was scared black neighbours would question his description of what happened to Brown on August 9. But he also feared being targeted by white supremacists who might accuse him of harming Wilson’s case. The Los Angeles Times reports him as telling investigators: ‘I do think of the Ku Klux Klan. I do.’ He is also said to have searched his own name on the internet and found the phrase ‘Snitches get stitches’. Another witness was so concerned about the potential reaction to giving evidence that he did not speak to police until nearly two weeks after Brown’s death, reports the Los Angeles Times, which says some peopele 'wrestled with the fallout' of having seen the incident. The witness is quoted as testifying: ‘You never know how people react to certain things.’ The grand jury heard from Dorian Johnson, the website reports, who was next to Brown when Wilson arrived on the scene and who fled when shots were fired.

Revealing his fears about speaking to police, he is quoted as saying: ‘I was so afraid, I didn't know what was going to happen to me. ‘I basically just didn't, really didn't feel comfortable with Ferguson at the time.’ Violence flared after the decision was announced by St Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch at around 8:25pm on Monday evening, and continued throughout the evening and into early Tuesday morning. As President Barack Obama appeared on television to appeal for calm, angry crowds took to the streets after the grand jury determined there was no probable cause to charge the officer with any crime for the shooting.

"Last year the nasal flu vaccine was offered to two and three year olds. It has been extended to four-year-olds this year, but only a quarter have had it . Parents must take their young children to have the flu vaccine because they are ‘super-spreaders’ of the virus, according to the chief medical officer. Dame Sally Davies said that so far this year, only a quarter of children aged two to four have been vaccinated even though all are eligible. She warned that it was crucial they are protected as they are vulnerable themselves and may pass it on to elderly relatives or pregnant mums. Last year was the first time that all two and three year olds were offered the vaccine and from this autumn, it has been extended to four year olds. But uptake is considerably lower this year and fewer than a third of the two million children in this age group have been vaccinated. It is administered as a nasal spray containing a tiny amount of the virus which is enough to make the body immune. Dame Sally said: ‘Flu can be really nasty for toddlers, leading to time off nursery which has a big impact on mums and dads and sometimes even a stay in hospital. 'They also spread the virus easily and often pass flu to grandparents and other relatives who can become very ill, fast. ‘Giving two, three and four year olds the free nasal spray really is in everyone’s interests if you want to help avoid a miserable winter for all the family.’ NHS figures yesterday showed that flu rates across the UK are currently low, although they have just started to rise slightly. Yet there have been no precise statistics for England only since the beginning of October because of ‘data quality’ issues. The flu jab is also offered for free to pregnant women, the over 65s, front-line NHS staff and anyone with an underlying health problem. But in 2012 the Government agreed to extend it to the under-fives following a particularly severe flu outbreak which claimed the lives of several previously healthy children. Next year, they plan to offer it to all five and six year olds at school and eventually it will be available to all children under 16. Scientists advising the Government have calculated that even only vaccinating half of children under four for flu would prevent half a million cases. Young children are known as ‘super-spreaders’ amongst medical professionals as they come into close contact with friends, don’t wash their hands or cover their mouths when coughing. Dame Sally Davies, Britain's chief medical officer, is urging more parents to take their children to be vaccinated in an effort to stop the spread of flu this winter . Officials are particularly concerned they may spread it on to elderly relatives who may develop bronchitis and pneumonia. Figures show that patients with an underlying health problem such as heart disease or asthma are 11 times more likely to die from flu. Since September, when the immunisation campaign began, only 29 per cent of two year olds have had the vaccination compared with 34 per cent last year. The uptake in three year olds is broadly similar and this is the first year four year olds have been offered the treatment. But the Department of Health said that half of mothers were not aware the vaccine existed or that their children were eligible. Others may also be wary of side-effects. The vaccine contains a weakened form of the flu virus but experts insist it is safe. Manufacturers say one in ten children tend to suffer from side-effects which include a runny nose and headaches. Children with egg allergies or asthma cannot have the spray as it may trigger reactions. Instead they are advised to have a standard jab. Experts say the spray works far better in children with fewer side-effects. The jab can cause a very mild bout of flu. Children have been dubbed 'super-spreaders' because they often pass the illness to other family members, including grandparents who can become very ill .","Vaccine offered to children in 2012 after severe outbreak lead to deaths .

"Renowned as much for her passionate battle to revive the British high street as she is for her bright red bob, Mary Portas is not a woman to sit back and watch injustices happen. Particularly when it comes to shopping. As she launches her new fashion line for House of Fraser, the mother-of-three spoke to Good Housekeeping magazine about her disbelief that women just one year out of their thirties are made to feel 'invisible' when buying clothes, and why her anger drove her to target women over 40 with her new collection. Queen of Shops Mary Portas has created a line of clothes for House of Fraser aimed at the over-40s, who she feels are 'invisible' on the British high street . Portas, 53, said: 'Women of this age are genuinely . invisible on the high street. Most shops when they are targeting women . use 18-year-old models. 'What are we doing here? There must be something . unattractive about being old - that's the message, and I think that's a . really ugly message. 'I wanted to create a collection that had women of . that age in the campaign and which thought about their bodies and the . things that are important to them - what we can highlight and what we . don't want to highlight!' Talking about having the confidence to look good once you're over a certain age, she said: 'I'm 53! You have permission to push . boundaries. I call it the mutton moment. 'It's when women look in the . mirror and think 'Can I, can't I?' We need more women to stand up and . say it's okay! Confidence comes from you having a sense of yourself. 'It's about really understanding your . body, your shape and what makes you feel confident when you put it on. Try to look at the clothes in different colours, but know your basic . shape. 'I come back to that time and time again. I am no good at a . vintage layered look. I end up looking like Grayson Perry! No offence, Grayson, it just doesn't suit me.' Mary Portas, left, and her civil partner Melanie Rickey, right, who have a toddler son named Horatio, to whom Rickey gave birth after a course of IVF . She continued: 'The . really important thing is to be always moving and to always push . boundaries. So many women will fall into a comfort zone, a safety place. 'I have been lucky enough to be in a world where there's always . something new that happens. But I think it only happens because I . embrace the new as well. I embrace fear, too.' When it comes to staying in shape, Portas said she was lucky enough to find that easy: 'I'm . very lucky, as I inherited my father's genes. He was very slim. But . keeping yourself healthy is something that everyone should work at.' 'I'm very lucky, as I inherited my father's genes. He was very slim. But keeping yourself healthy is something that everyone should work at' She continued:'I . have never dieted, but I normally run three times a week and do some . yoga. I haven't been running much lately with a baby, though! 'I used to . roll out of bed, get into some running gear and go for a run. But now . you roll out of bed and he's there! But I do push him in the buggy . around Regent's Park.' The . retail guru, who has two teenage children with her ex-husband Graham . Portas and a toddler with her civil partner Melanie Rickey, also said . she feel's 'extraordinarily blessed' by her children, but that she . thinks 'that's it now'. About staying sane, Portas said that her secret is the odd bit of meditation: 'I am a bit rubbish . at it, but I do it! I'm a great walker, and my walking boots are always . in the back of the car. 'I'm a bit of a Forrest Gump. If I can walk, I . will walk - I love it. It really cleanses my head. I also love a glass . of red wine!'

"The Keenan family are living in the wrong era. From their retro wardrobes to every single room and appliance in their house - they eat, breathe and live the 1950s lifestyle - today. The Keenans’ home is decked out with vintage appliances that colour coordinate with the 50s wallpaper.  And then there's the outfits and hair do's. It's a style that Pixie Keenan, from Sydney, has been embracing for more than 30 years. ‘I dress like this every day and have done so since the age of 15,’ Mrs Keenan told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Meet the Keenan family – (from left) Nasya, Pixie, Aaron and Gage, who appear to have been born in the wrong era . Mrs Keenan, 47, dresses in floral vintage dresses, sets her candy-floss hair in curls and finishes the look with white cat’s-eye spectacles. ‘My whole family wears 1950s clothing too and they love it,’ she said. Her son Gage, 11, would generally wear a pair of jeans, a bisley shirt and converse kicks when he goes out. ‘The bisley shirts were very popular in the 1950s and it’s getting a little harder to find but I’ve got quite a collection. Her husband Aaron, 37, wears the same and sports an Elvis-like hairstyle complete with sideburns. He’s also the lead singer of a rockabilly band called No Brakes. 'He’ll wear a bisley shirt or a 1950s suit when he performs or something more rockabilly oriented like the country western style shirts. ‘My daughter, Nasya, 22, wears vintage occasionally but she really likes the reproduction clothes. She looks fantastic in a 1950s wiggle skirt – so that’s a high-waisted skirt or a pencil skirt that is well fitted and three-quarter length and she’ll wear a pretty blouse with it. ‘And I prefer the beautiful big skirts so the floral full skirts or even the double or triple skirts. And lots of petticoats, stockings and a good old fashioned bullet bra because it gives you that perfect shape! And I have a fetish for fascinators and hats.' Pixie's husband, Aaron (left) is the lead singer of a rockabilly band called 'No Brakes' so he's always dressed in a bisley shirt or 1950's suit . Like father, like son: The family's youngest member, Gage (left) dresses like his dad - sporting a pair of trousers and a bisley shirt . The 46-year-old was six years old when her obsession with the decade began after her parents took her to see Elvis Presley perform live in Las Vegas. ‘I was very young but I was brought up on Elvis music,’ she said. ‘When I saw this man live, it was literally like seeing God himself because he had such an angelic voice, and to see the person that angelic voice belonged to was quite overwhelming.' The family kitchen comes complete with utensils, a lemon coloured Sunbeam Mixmaster, a Colda fridge and even an early Kooka gas oven – all in working condition. They also own a huge Precedent TV in the lounge room, as well as a rotary-dial telephone in the hallway. ‘The furniture in those days was such good quality and in fact, most of my life purchases that are 60 years old are still in good condition. ‘Things back then were made to last – whereas these days, we are a disposable generation where things only last for a year or so and then you have to throw them out. ‘We’ve also got a 1950s beauty parlour and a magnificent cocktail bar – these are all sentimental items to me and I can tell you when and where I got each and every piece from – they've become part of my family.' Inside Mrs Keenan's beauty parlour, her beauty products are true to the era, with authentic 50's roller set, hair dryers and make-up . Each and every item has been colour coordinated with the wallpaper in every room of the family home . The mother of two also keeps herself busy with her own 50s inspired business - Boogie Bop Dames - where she teaches deportment classes, as well as hair and make-up workshops after she taught herself the authentic styles. ‘I teach ladies how to present themselves, how to hold themselves correctly and how to sit properly,' she said. ‘I just think that people had a lot more respect for other human beings back then and had good old fashion values – where people would walk down the street and greet each other and gentlemen were gentlemen – they opened the car door and pulled back the chair. ‘And that to me that is really important and is something I’m still teaching my children.’ The Keenan home comes complete with a Precedent TV, a rotary-dial telephone and traditional family board games . The mother of two keeps herself busy with her own 50s inspired business - Boogie Bop Dames - where she teaches hair and make-up workshops . Mrs Keenan also runs her own vintage photo studio where she gives her clients a 50s makeover from head to toe. Her clients range from women of all ages to men or 14-year-old's parties. ‘It’s an experience stepping back in time and the thing is, most woman who come along and are photographed by me lack a lot of self-confidence because they've never done anything special in their life,’ she said. ‘So what I do is I transform them with their hair and make-up so that they can see their true beauty. ‘Whether, it’s tucked down deep inside or whatever it is – most of these women for the very first time wouldn't acknowledge that they’re beautiful.  So I put them in a pretty dress and I pose them so they feel good about themselves. ‘Then when I turn the camera around,  they cannot believe it’s them. In fact, I’ve had a lot of woman cry because they cannot believe the beautiful woman in that photograph is them.' Mrs Keenan's daughter, Nasya wears vintage occasionally, dressed in 1950s floral dresses or pencil skirts and beautiful blouses . When the family get together, they dine at an authentic 1950's diner before they head to the Skyline drive-in to watch a movie . The kitchen comes complete with 50s kitchen utensils, a lemon-coloured Sunbeam Mixmaster, a Colda fridge and an early Kooka gas oven . When the family get together, they occasionally visit the local Skyline drive-in and dine at an authentic 1950’s restaurant. ‘There’s nothing better than going to the drive-ins with the family – you go to the diner and you have a chilli dog or hot dog – it’s very American style and you sit in your car and watch the movie with your family – It’s great fun,' she said. When asked what her favourite collection was, she couldn't decide between her Barbie collection and her swimsuits. ‘My favourite is probably my 1950's private swimsuit collection. I’ve got some really stunning ones and I think they’re just divine and flattering. They’re modest so you’re covering everything that you should be covering and you just feel good and feel like a million dollars when you wear them.' Mrs Keenan has been living the lifestyle for over 30 years and she's grateful that her family have all shared the same interests and passion . While the lifestyle isn’t everyone’s cup of tea, Pixie is grateful her family share the same interests and passion for the era that she does . Mrs Keenan said while their lifestyle isn’t everyone’s cup of tea, she's grateful that her family share the same interests and passion for the era that she does. 'Not everyone is accepting of my lifestyle choices but that's ok - each to their own,' she said. ‘I believe that everybody should be able to do what they want and dress the way they choose in life – providing it doesn’t hurt another human being. ‘There’s nothing wrong with being different – its important to be different, not everybody needs to be the same. There’s nothing wrong with being an individual and sharing your love for whatever it might be. ‘The people who step outside the box and have enough confidence really need to be applauded.'

"More than a dozen people wound up in New York hospitals over the weekend after smoking synthetic marijuana. At least 15 people were hospitalized after using the poisonous pot imposter known as ‘K2’ and ‘Spice’ to get high, authorities said. All of the victims who experienced ‘severe adverse reactions’ lived in Chelsea and Harlem, law enforcement sources told WNBC. Synthetic pot: The vile concoction landed 15 people in the hospital over the past weekend . ‘K2, Spice, Green Giant – no matter what you call it, synthetic cannabinoids are dangerous and illegal,’ Health Commissioner Dr. Mary Bassett told the station. ‘I urge people not to use these products, which have caused a huge spike in emergency room visits this year.’ ER visits as a result of synthetic weed have shot up 220 per cent, according to the New York Post. Some of the symptoms over adverse reactions include seizures and hallucinations, WABC reported.The synthetic marijuana was made illegal in 2012. Louisiana officials called the fake drugs ‘a poison’ in comments earlier this month to The Advocate. ‘It’s not really anything like marijuana,’ Dr. Beau Clark, East Baton Rouge Parish’s coroner, told the paper. ‘The effects have been unpredictable.’ No one has died from taking the harmful drugs, but a man reportedly beat a dog to death with a brick after consuming them in June.","The victims were concentrated in Harlem and Chelsea .

"Banned: Brendan Quinn, 38, has been permanently struck off from the medical profession . The boss of a rehab clinic dubbed the ‘Showbiz Alcatraz’ has been kicked out of the profession over his ‘flagrant disregard’ for patient safety. Brendan Quinn, 38, was manager of the £10,000 a week Causeway Retreat on Osea Island, Malden, Essex, which boasted Take That’s Mark Owen and the late Amy Winehouse as patients. Channel 4 executive Sarah Mulvey, who was behind hit shows like ‘10 Years Younger’ and ‘How To Look Good Naked,’ killed herself in January 2010 after she was treated on the island. She had self-harmed and made an attempt on her own life the day before she was told by staff to leave the retreat. At an inquest into her death, her father, Dr Christopher Mulvey, criticised the clinic, saying: ‘There were so many opportunities at this point to help her and they were not taken.’ Advertising material for the Causeway Retreat named Quinn as one of Britain’s 250 best private doctors, even though he was not qualified, the Nursing and Midwifery Council heard. Quinn was the boss and a major shareholder of the facility’s operator, Twenty 7 Management, which rented the Edwardian manor. The Causeway, which charged a minimum £5,000 per week, also treated actor Jonathan Rhys Meyers and members of some of Britain’s wealthiest families. It was never registered as an independent hospital with watchdog the Care Quality Commission. But patients with mental health problems were admitted to the unlicensed facility, the hearing was told. The clinic did not have a doctor on site at all times and patients were adequately supervised. Quinn also failed to tell employees they were working illegally in an unlicensed hospital. While he was in charge medication was administered by unqualified staff without valid prescriptions and drugs were stored in a suitcase in an unlocked room. Tragic: Channel 4 executive Sarah Mulvey, who was behind hit shows like ‘10 Years Younger’ and ‘How To Look Good Naked,’ killed herself in January 2010 after she was treated on the island . NMC panel chairman James Spencer told him: ‘Your acts and omissions could foreseeably have caused significant harm to patients. ‘You consistently placed your own commercial needs above those of highly vulnerable patients. ‘You not only deceived the public as to your correct qualifications, by holding yourself out as a doctor, you also deceived those involved in ensuring correct registration of services as to the exact nature of the services provided at the Causeway.’ The hearing into Quinn’s management of the Causeway began in 2012 and has been adjourned at least five times, having run for more than 90 days, costing the taxpayer more than £300,000. Announcing the decision to strike Quinn off Mr Spencer said there was no doubt his conduct had put patients at ‘unwarranted risk of harm’. He told Quinn: ‘You allowed particularly vulnerable patients to be admitted into an unregistered and unsafe environment. 'You failed to ensure that the Causeway was capable of providing adequate and appropriate care to patients through your failure to establish and maintain appropriate arrangements for the management of medication and your failure to ensure adequate staffing levels. ‘Throughout the period of the charges, you demonstrated a flagrant disregard for patient safety. ‘The panel was also satisfied that your misconduct brought the reputation of the profession into disrepute.’ He added: ‘In all the circumstances the panel concluded that your misconduct was fundamentally incompatible with your ongoing registration. Celebrity patients: Causeway Retreat on Osea Island, Essex, has treated stars including the late Amy Winehouse (left) and Take That's Mark Owen (right) ‘It decided that the only sanction sufficient to protect the public was a striking off order. Additionally, it considered that the public’s trust and confidence in the profession, and the NMC as a regulatory body, would be significantly undermined were a striking off order not imposed in your case.’ Quinn, of Lewes, East Sussex, denied all the allegations against him, insisting former staff members had cooked up elaborate stories to ruin his reputation. He said: ‘They have been determined to absolutely destroy my career and indeed they’ve done an absolutely superb job. ‘They have come here and they have given evidence and they’ve had regular meetings outside this process.’ He claimed he had also been bombarded with anonymous text messages from pay-as-you go phones threatening him and his family. But the panel dismissed Quinn’s claims of an elaborate conspiracy saying it ‘lacks credibility’. Earlier Krystal Whymet for the NMC said: ‘Quinn allowed for clients to be admitted to Causeway who were suffering from mental health matters, even when warned by the CSCI (Commission for Social Care Inspection) that this was not appropriate. ‘He did not ensure that the clients suffering from mental health matters were adequately assessed of supervised. Lie: Advertising material for the Causeway Retreat (above) named Quinn as one of Britain’s 250 best private doctors, even though he was not qualified, the Nursing and Midwifery Council heard . ‘He did not ensure that patients with mental health matters were provided with adequate treatment plans or aftercare. ‘The registrant allowed a client who had suffered a stroke to be admitted to the Causeway despite not having adequate facilities for mobility restricted patients. ‘He failed to ensure that adequate arrangements were in place to prevent risks to the health and safety of clients staff and visitors.’ Quinn was cleared of a series of charges, including claims that he allowed a female client to solicit sex for cash. Claims that he instructed a staff member to remove a client’s prosthetic leg to stop him wandering about were also found not proved. He was also cleared of allegations that clients had access to kitchen knives and ropes and that boats bringing clients to the island were not equipped with enough life jackets. The Causeway was shut down after an investigation and Twenty 7 Management was fined £8,000 for running an unlicensed hospital at Chelmsford Magistrates’ Court in November 2010. District Judge David Cooper described the company as ‘atrocious’ and said ‘its standards would really shame a third world country’. Quinn has 28 days to appeal the panel’s decision before he is struck off.

"A small hibernating frog may be vital in helping man conquer space, according to new research. The burrowing frog, Cyclorana alboguttata, which grows to about three inches long, has the ability to hibernate for months without suffering any muscle wastage. The problem of how to maintain muscle in zero gravity is one of the hurdles which will have to be overcome before astronauts can undertake future missions to Mars. A small hibernating frog may be vital in helping man conquer space, according to new research. The burrowing frog, Cyclorana alboguttata, which grows to about three inches long, has the ability to hibernate for months without suffering any muscle wastage . The research could also help prevent muscle deterioration in bedridden patients, according to the research published in the journal of the Society for Experimental Biology. Now Australian scientists have identified key genes that help burrowing frogs avoid muscle wastage whilst they are dormant. The study by University of Queensland found green-striped burrowing frogs go underground and wrap themselves in a cocoon of shed skin when resources are scarce in the outback. PhD student Beau Reilly said: 'If we can understand the cell signalling pathways that confer resistance to muscle wasting, then these could be useful candidates to study in mammalian muscle atrophy. In space, damage to human tissue is such that it is equivalent to a 30- to 50-year-old crew member's muscles deteriorating to that of an 80-year-old. Jaxa astronaut Koichi Wakata is . pictured here working out on the ISS to reduce the effects of muscle wastage . In space, damage to human tissue is such that it is equivalent to a 30- to 50-year-old crew member's muscles deteriorating to that of an 80-year-old. This is because the absence of gravity in space makes working in a spacecraft physically undemanding. On Earth, people constantly use certain muscles to support ourselves against the force of gravity. These muscles, commonly called antigravity muscles, include the calf muscles, the quadriceps and the muscles of the back and neck. Because astronauts work in a weightless environment, very little muscle contraction is needed to support their bodies. Without regular use and exercise our muscles weaken and deteriorate. It’s a process called atrophy. Studies have shown that astronauts experience experience up to a 20 percent loss of muscle mass on spaceflights lasting five to 11 days. 'These could help to develop therapies to treat bedridden human patients or even astronauts, who frequently lose muscle tone when exposed to reduced-gravity conditions.' One of the genes named 'survivin' appears to protect cells from a 'suicide' mechanism which normally removes damaged or diseased cells. This gene has also been shown to be highly active in human cancer cells. Another gene, checkpoint kinase 1, regulates cell division and DNA repair. In mammals, inactive muscles can become damaged by highly charged molecules called Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) which are believed to degrade proteins, causing the muscles to waste away. However in the tail-less amphibians seem to suffer less damage from ROS. Miss Reilly said this may be due to increased levels of protective antioxidants, including the compounds thioredoxin and sulfiredoxin. Similar results have also been found in hibernating mammals, such as squirrels. She added: 'I am fascinated in animals that survive in extreme conditions. I think humans and modern medicine could learn a great deal from organisms such as burrowing frogs.'","Burrowing frog, Cyclorana alboguttata, hibernates for months at a time .

"It's one of the most famous homes in Britain, but we recognise it best from its well-guarded front exteriors; it's rare we get to peek inside. But now the doors to the Prime Minister's private apartments have been flung open, with David Cameron allowing photographers into his kitchen to capture him, on film, having a friendly chat with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. And naturally, being the inquisitive bunch we are, our eyes were immediately drawn to the PM's bookshelf, seeing if we could get an insight into how he Samantha spend their evenings at home. We can now reveal that the backless £665 Oka frame is populated with high-end foodie tomes (The Ginger Pig Meat Book, The Flavour Thesaurus, The River Cottage Every Day by Hugh Fearnley-Whitingstall, a fellow Old Etonian and - most intriguingly - The Abs Diet), as well as  art and decor books (Art And Artists, Provence Interiors), DVD box sets (two series of 24), and current affairs and political reads (Jeremy Paxman: On Royalty). What's on David's bookshelf? A photograph of Prime Minister David Cameron and German chancellor Angela Merkel chatting in his Downing Street apartments . Cookbooks and box sets: The Cameron family bookshelf is full of high-end foodie tomes - including The Flavour Thesaurus and the Ginger Pig Meat Book - and DVDs . The appearance of the diet tome, aimed at ridding people of their wobbly tummies, led some to wonder whether the Prime Minister might be worried about middle-age spread. Blurb for the book claims it can help you lose 12lbs in just two weeks. Its website encourages dieters thus: 'Imagine yourself with great abs. Imagine the perfect look for you — be it a firm, flat, tight, sexy belly that looks great every day or a ripped abdominal ""six-pack"" you can show off on the beach.' A similar photo, including another fascinating insight into the family's reading habits, was taken in number 11 Downing Street (where the family live instead of in number 10, because the apartments are bigger) in 2011, featuring Samantha Cameron and Michelle Obama. In that photo other books spotted were a Paris Interiors coffee table book, The Family Cookbook, the Complete Works of William Shakespeare, a large selection of children's books, and Mrs Beeton's Household Management. On the DVD shelf the family had a special edition Star Wars box set, a Desperate Housewives box set, a Brideshead Revisited box set, a Band of Brothers box set, Michael McIntyre Live and Laughing, Armageddon, The Departed, Goodfellas, Yes Man, Kill Bill, SpongeBob SquarePants and Wiggles. Since 2011 the family have also replaced their old toaster and kettle set with smart matching yellow appliances from the Kenwood kMix range, £59.99 each They still have the mustard yellow Fancy Nancy sofa they had three years ago. Today Mr Cameron tweeted a photograph of the occasion, remarking: 'I'm happy to welcome Angela Merkel to my Downing St flat, after her excellent address to Parliament.' Tweet tweet! David Cameron posted a picture of himself and Mrs Merkel in his kitchen on Twitter after their meeting . Tea with Dave: During her one-day visit to the UK, Mrs Merkel will hold meetings with the leaders of the three main political parties, as well as having tea with Queen Elizabeth Buckingham Palace . The apartment is still as modern, neat and clean as it was when it was seen in 2011, the graphite kitchen cabinets (Round .

"Muhammad Ali cannot remember his third heavyweight title win, his daughter has revealed . Boxing great Muhammad Ali cannot remember winning his third world heavyweight title, his daughter has revealed - but he still jokes about making a comeback to win it again. Ali, who has been fighting bravely against Parkinson's Disease for 30 years, has no memory of his third world title victory against Leon Spinks in 1978, often telling his daughter Hana that he plans on becoming a three-time champion. But the sporting legend still has his wicked sense of humour, Hana says, and after being corrected on his great achievements jokes that he could yet make a comeback aged 72. Speaking to The Sun, Hana said: 'A few months ago he was messing with me and telling me he was going to become the three-time champ. 'I said, ""You're already the three-time champ. If you come back you'll be the four-time champ"". He said, ""No, no - I'm the two-time champ."" 'He said, ""I'm going to look it up."" And then he calls me back and says, ""I'm the three-time champ, so I'm going to be the four-time champ.""' Ali, then fighting under his birth name Cassius Clay, won his first heavyweight world title in 1964 as a 7-1 underdog when he defeated Sonny Liston. His famous line that he would 'float like a butterfly, sting like a bee' came in the build-up to that fight, after which he declared himself 'The Greatest'. Ali ducks to avoid Leon Spinks' fist during his defeat in 1978, but just months later Ali regained the world heavyweight title in Las Vegas . Ali, fighting under his birth name Cassius Clay, won his first title against Sonny Liston in 1964 . He held the belt until 1967, by which time he had converted to Islam and named himself Muhammad Ali, when he was stripped of the title for refusing to fight in Vietnam. He made a comeback and in 1974 knocked out George Foreman in the eight round of the Rumble in the Jungle to become world champion for the second time. He held the title for four years before unexpectedly losing to Leon Spinks in 1978, but defeated him in Las Vegas months later - the bout he does not remember. Hana, 38, and half-sister Maryum, 46, denied rumours that their father is unable to speak, bedridden and close to death. They added that despite Ali's Parkinson's, which can cause tremors, slow movement, problems with speech and memory loss, his fighting spirit remains the same. Rumble in the Jungle: Ali took his second title in Zaire, knocking out George Foreman in the eighth round . Daughters Hana (left) and Maryum say their father (right) still has the same fighting spirit as ever . 'His personality has not changed.

"Wedding and party season fast approaches and if you're stuck for cake inspiration - bored of tired old fruit cake and marzipan, like most of us - there is a ghoulish alternative. Annebel de Vetten, nicknamed Annabel Lecter, is the go-to baker if you want something truly memorable. A tower of birds' skulls, for example, or a startlingly lifelike hairy hog's head. Annabel runs the Conjurer's Kitchen in Birmingham and specialises in the kind of cakes you won't find in your local bakery. Brain food: Annabel has become famous for her terrifyingly realistic cakes - a motley collection of dead baby heads, skinned birds, rodent skulls, blood soaked intestines and human brains, pictured here, made out of marshmallow . Baker Annabel said: 'When people look at my cakes, they recoil in disgust, but it's funny watching their expressions as they bite into a bit of intestine and realise it tastes like chocolate cake' Pig's dinner: These remarkable pig's heads are delicious cakes. 'You should never be afraid to try things,' says alternative baker Annabel De Vetten . Anna De Vetton makes jaw-dropping cakes, such as this tiered skullcake, at her Conjourer's Kitchen in Kings Heath .

"The novelist Elizabeth Jane Howard, former wife of Kingsley Amis, has died aged 90. She died peacefully at home in Bungay, Suffolk, following a short illness. Best known for The Cazalet Chronicles, a series of semi-autobiographical books about an affluent family living in pre- and post-war London (the fifth and final installment of which was published in November), the prolific writer was also famed for her love affairs with prominent men, chiefly fellow writers and actors. A natural beauty who modelled for Vogue in the late 1940s, Howard was married three times, first aged 19 to Sir Peter Scott, the conservationist son of Antarctic explorer Robert Falcon Scott and the man with whom she had her only child, daughter Nicola.

But just four years later Howard left both husband and daughter to pursue a literary career, marrying actor and writer Jim Douglas-Henry in 1958, staying in the dreadfully unhappy union for five years. After beginning an affair with him while he was married to Hilary Bardwell, Howard herself married novelist Sir Kingsley Amis in 1965, becoming stepmother to his three children, including his son Martin, but they had a tempestuous relationship and divorced in 1983, never speaking again. Martin Amis has, however, credited his stepmother with encouraging him to pursue literature, first as a recreational reader, then as a novelist. She gave him his first copy of Pride And Prejudice, written by her favourite author, Jane Austen. Between - and often during - her marriages she had numerous love affairs with famously artistic men including Arthur . Koestler, Cyril Connolly and Kenneth Tynan.

Howard even had relationships with the poets Cecil Day-Lewis - husband of her best friend Jill Balcon - and Laurie Lee - married to her friend Cathy - and became godmother to daughters of each couple. Speaking to Elizabeth Day in The Observer in April, Howard said: 'I was very happy with Laurie, whom I loved dearly. And I never had any - I want to make this clear, Cathy knew this - I never had any designs on him. 'I just took that bit of pleasure as it came and it was wonderful, and we all knew each other and we never had a cross word. 'I mean, most people would think it was rather shocking I expect but it didn't shock us and we were the people in it. 'If a very attractive man makes a dead set at you and you're very lonely, it's very difficult to resist him... I think I was very given to getting ambushed.'

Howard was born in London on 26 March 1923, and grew up in a Lansdowne Road, Notting Hill - the same road in which The Cazalet Chronocles opens - in a large house full of brothers and servants. The daughter of an unhappy marriage between a timber merchant and a ballerina, Howard had a difficult relationship with her own mother, who constantly told her she was unattractive, and left home before she reached her 20s.

"A new drug being tested to treat cancer could help people affected by a common form of autism, scientists believe. Researchers have identified a chemical pathway that goes awry in the brains of 'Fragile X' patients. They say the cancer drug could block the pathway and reverse their behavioural symptoms. Fragile X Syndrome is the most common genetic cause of autism spectrum disorders. Scroll down for video . A drug being tested to treat cancer could help people affected by Fragile X, the most common form of inherited autism. The drug blocks a rogue pathway in the brain that causes behavioural symptoms (file photo) It affects around one in 4,000 boys and one in 6,000 girls. Currently, there is no cure. The team at Edinburgh University and McGill University in Canada identified a key molecule - eIF4E - that triggers excess protein production in the brains of Fragile X patients. This can cause behavioural symptoms that include learning difficulties. It can also lead to more serious intellectual disabilities, delays in speech and language development and problems with social interactions. They found that eIF4E regulates the production of a specific enzyme, which breaks down and re-orders the connections between brain cells called synapses. This disrupts communication between brain cells, leading to changes in behaviour. The scientists have found that a naturally occurring chemical - called cercosporamide -  improved sociability in mice with the condition. Treatment with cercosporamide blocks the activity of eIF4E, and therefore reduces the amounts of the enzyme, and reverses the behavioural symptoms in mice with a version of Fragile X Syndrome. Cercosporamide is being tested as a treatment for lung cancer and acute myeloid leukemia. The new findings suggest that it could also have a use as a treatment for patients with Fragile X Syndrome. 'Our findings open the door to targeted treatments for Fragile X Syndrome,' said Dr Christos Gkogkas, of Edinburgh University, who carried out the research (file photo) Dr Christos Gkogkas, of Edinburgh University, said: 'Our findings open the door to targeted treatments for Fragile X Syndrome. 'By designing treatments that block just this pathway, it is hoped that we can limit the potential side-effects and develop therapies that are more efficient than general treatment approaches.' Professor Nahum Sonenberg, of McGill University, added: 'We found that eIF4E regulates the production of an enzyme called MMP-9, which breaks down and re-orders the connections between brain cells called synapses. 'Excess MMP-9 disrupts communication between brain cells, leading to changes in behaviour.' The study was published in the journal Cell Reports.","Team identified a chemical pathway that goes awry in 'Fragile X' patients .

"Norman Lamb recently highlighted the importance of developing new services and mobile phone apps to help young people with depression and mental health problems . Minister for Care Norman Lamb recently revealed that he is working towards developing more apps to help young people suffering with mental health problems and depression. He said in an interview with the times: 'We’ve got a taskforce looking at how we can modernise children and young people’s mental health and that’s one of the key elements to it.” 'If you’re a teenager and your world revolves around digital access, we must make sure you get access to therapy online. So these programmes are being developed.' But one such app already exists; Buddy App is a digital tool which supports therapy services. It allows users to text daily updates of how their feeling. The can then use the analysis tool to reassess how they are feeling and can set the app to send goal reminders via text message. Lastly the app allows users to set reminders for appointments and agendas so that they can take control over elements of their life. The app was created by Sidekick Studios a company which is passionate about using design and technology to tackle social problems and they work closely with many NHS healthcare providers. Femail spoke to Kat Cormack who explained that for the Sidekick team it was important to create something that would really help people. She said: 'Buddy has a few aims, first and foremost we want to help people. We’re a social enterprise so for us it’s about social impact, making a real, qualitative difference to people’s lives. 'There are now more mobile phones than people in the UK and we want people using NHS services to benefit from really cheap, accessible technology like SMS messaging.' Kat told us she even uses the app herself: 'I’m a service user myself and I think apps and other technologies have a huge role to play in improving mental health and wellbeing. 'Personally I’m using Buddy in my own treatment and over the last five months it’s really helped me to stay on track with my recovery. 'It’s amazing that something as simple as a couple of texts messages can make such a big difference.' The Buddy App allows users to log their feelings . Users of the Buddy App can send text messages describing their feelings, this helps them to assess how they are doing during the day . But she agrees that the app should be used in conjunction with other therapies. 'We don’t want to replace clinicians, we know that they have a huge impact on people’s lives. 'Research shows that it’s actually not the type of therapy you have but the relationship with your clinician that has the biggest effect on treatment efficacy. What we want to do is support clinicians to make their work even better.' In his interview Lamb revealed that there are more apps being developed but that it is important to remember when testing them that every young sufferer is different. 'What I want to achieve is a much more seamless service that allows you access online, face to face or over the telephone, whichever is appropriate.' 'These platforms are evidence-based so the risk is very low that they’re not appropriate. Some people may need more than that so you have to have access to a gradation of different type of service,' he said. When using the Buddy App you can log feelings about anything from how you're feeling that day to things you've got planned . Buddy will text you to remind you of appointments and meetings on your agenda . Femail spoke to Lucie Russell, Director of media and campaigns at the charity Young Minds which is committed to improving the mental health of children and young people. Lucie agreed with Norman and Kat that apps can be a positive way to help some young people with their issues. She said: 'What we need is a plethora of services both online and off. But I do think online and app support can be very positive for young people especially we find that they do interact a lot online, it's where they feel comfortable. 'Sometimes young people can be scared and or feel intimidated about phoning their doctor whereas online there are able to engage more freely. 'What there does need to be though is some regularity and I would say that the online support, whilst very useful, should never take the place of face to face therapies. 'Apps should always lead on to phone or face to face support, working as a sign post for young people and enabling them to get the help they need. 'If the NHS plan to work on apps the most important thing is that they speak to the young people, to those who have the first hand experience, so that they can work out what sort of services they're looking for.' According research by Young Minds one in 10 children and young people aged five to 16 suffer from a diagnosable mental health disorder. The number of those aged 15 to 16 with depression doubled between the 1980's and the 2000's with nearly 80,000 children and young people suffering from severe depression. If you do feel suicidal and need to speak to someone, call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90 or go to samaritans.org Alternatively, talk to your GP - if you don't get the help you want, go to another doctor.

"Don't worry, we have not travelled back in time 71 million years ago to the Jurassic World. This cute pair might look a bit like velociraptors from the Cretaceous period but they are in fact two Boyd's Forest Dragons which weigh just a few grams and are only 5cms long. Raptor and Nedry were born at Wild Life Sydney Zoo just days apart on October 23 and 25 and they each weigh just a few grams. Adorable duo Raptor and Nedry were born just days apart on October 23 and 25 . Matthew Mooney, reptile keeper at the zoo, said: 'It’s a very exciting time in the Daintree Rainforest zone' It's a massive achievement for the keepers at the Darling Harbour zoo who say it is 'notoriously difficult' to breed the creatures. Matthew Mooney, reptile keeper at the zoo, said: 'It’s a very exciting time in the Daintree Rainforest zone, however there is also a stringent observation process in place to ensure these tiny Boyd’s Forest Dragons receive the best possible start to life.' The tiny creature is just 5cm and only a few grams but they will grow to about 45cm in length . The cute characters were born at the city centre Wild Life Sydney Zoo on Darling Harbour . Boyd's Forest Dragons usually spend most of their time perched underneath tree trunks . Boyd's Forest Dragons are an arboreal agamid lizard found in rainforests in northern Queensland . The creatures are restricted to living in rainforests from north of Townsville to near Cooktown . They usually spend most of their time perched underneath tree trunks . They can move up to 100m a day on the ground . Boyd's Forest Dragons eat earthworms, small fruits and vertebrates . They are born from eggs which normally measure about 30mm long and 15mm wide . They have been hand reared since birth and are quickly gaining weight and strength in the attraction’s back-of-house reptile room until they are ready to go on display in the rainforest zone. Mr Mooney added: 'Raptor and Nedry are the first Boyd’s Forest Dragons to hatch at the zoo in a few years, which is a really exciting development and a true testament to the dedication and passion of our keepers. 'Boyd’s Forest Dragons are notoriously difficult to breed, so we've been giving these juveniles frequent feeds of insects, taking them outside to enjoy some sunlight, as well as closely monitoring their health daily.' Raptor and Nedry will eventually grow to around 45cm and will develop the eye-catching head crests and spikes Boyd’s Forest Dragons are best known for. The creatures are only found in north Queensland  rainforests, such as the Daintree. Due to their relatively small range, the species is susceptible to decline if these rainforests continue to be degraded by agriculture and climate change. .","Adorable duo Raptor and Nedry were born just days apart last month .

"You've been with your boyfriend a year. You think he's pretty swell. He asks you to move in with him. You say 'sure, what the heck'. But you're not totally convinced he's the one... so what do you do with all the duplicate belongings you'll now have? The toasters, the teapots, the wine racks, the hoovers? Do you sell them? Do you store them in the attic and risk a tiff about your commitment to the relationship? Or do you squirrel them away in secret, ready to collect when the inevitable happens and you go your separate ways? Now there's an easy way to do just that, thanks to a British storage facility offering a 'break-up protection service' for newly cohabiting couples. Don't think he's The One? Use Lovespace's clandestine storage facility to stash away your duplicate possessions so you can reclaim them if you do break up . Storage-by-the-box provider Lovespace will secretly store duplicate items for uncertain cohabiters who might wish to keep hold of the second washing machine and spare set of tea cosies, should the relationship fail. Since 29 per cent of UK households consist of only one person, when two people decide to live together they often have two of everything, such as kettles, toasters, linen, crockery and other personal effects that there isn't space for in their new house. Cohabiting couples are twice as likely to break up as married partners, according to research, so if throw away all of your household and personal items before moving in, you could be left with an expensive shopping trip to re-establish your independence if you do break up. Steve Folwell, managing director of Lovespace, said: 'We wanted to help the biggest commitment-phobes move in with their partners. 'Openly keeping hold of things that you identify with your single life isn't exactly a recipe for happily ever after, so we decided to offer apprehensive cohabiters a secret service where they can keep a box of their past life.' Doubled-up: Since 29 per cent of UK households consist of only one person, when two people decide to live together they often have two of everything .

"Recent storms may have caused the roof of a privately-run Texas prison to collapse Saturday and injure  20 inmates, authorities say. Diboll Correctional Center, owned by Management & Training Corp, is about 100 miles northeast of Houston. One of the injured was airlifted to the large city after the collapse, an additional 10 were transported to local hospitals by ambulance. The airlifted inmate is in critical condition, according to the Lufkin Daily News, which added the facility houses low to medium-security inmates. Ushering the injured out: AmeriCare and Lufkin ambulances leave the scene of a ceiling collapse at the Diboll Correctional Facility on Saturday, July 19, 2014 in Diboll, Texas . Where it happened: The Diboll Correctional Facility in Diboll, Texas . 'It probably had a lot to do with the rain over the last couple days,' warden David Driscoll told WGHP. The remaining injured inmates suffered cuts and bruises when wallboard fell from the ceiling of a housing area at the prison about 11.30 a.m., a prison spokesperson said in a statement. MTC spokesperson Issa Arnita said 86 inmates were in the area when the ceiling material fell. He said officials are trying to determine the cause. 'We got a lot of rain yesterday. It’s a new building, a new facility. I don’t know why the roof would collapse,' Lufkin Fire Department Battalion Chief Jesse Moody told the station. Diboll has received over six inches of rain in the alst five days, according to the Weather Underground. An MTC spokesperson said the prison opened in June 1995.

"Maura Murray, 72, now lives with 20 per cent kidney function . When you go to hospital for surgery, your main concern is that the procedure is a success and fixes the problem. A . secondary concern might be worries about catching a hospital superbug - . but that fear may be misplaced, because you are actually much more . likely to develop acute kidney injury (AKI). Few people have heard of . AKI, let alone realise they could be at risk. But astonishingly, one . patient in five admitted to hospital for surgery or to treat an . infection - that's half a million people in the UK every year - develops . AKI. The condition causes the kidneys to shut down within days and, . left untreated, can lead to severe dehydration and even death. Every . year at least 12,000 people die of acute kidney injury - that's 200 . times more deaths than are caused by MRSA (methicillin-resistant . staphylococcus aureus). Furthermore, up to 1,000 more people per year . need a lifetime of dialysis or a kidney transplant as a result of what . should be an entirely treatable condition. Acute kidney injury is . also hugely expensive to the NHS - costing more to treat each year than . breast cancer. Yet the sums needed to diagnose and treat it are . negligible. Diagnosis requires a simple blood test along with . regular measurement of urine output. Treatment is with standard . antibiotics and intravenous fluids to rehydrate the kidneys. What worries experts is that too often medics dismiss AKI symptoms as insignificant. Maura . Murray's experience is typical. In April 2012, the retired maths . teacher from Surrey, now 72, was recovering in hospital after surgery . for a broken thigh bone. The night before she was discharged, she . had to go to the loo several times - and told the nurse she was worried . she might have picked up a urinary tract infection. 'The nurse told . me that going to the loo frequently was normal after having a catheter . removed,' says the mother of three grown-up children. It's true that . having a urinary catheter can make the urethra extra-sensitive for a . day or so, causing people to go to the loo more frequently. But one . person in ten who has a urinary catheter removed develops a urinary . tract infection - and this can easily move to the kidneys if untreated. Indeed, a urinary tract infection is a main reason for acute kidney . injury following post-surgery. 'It should have rung alarm bells with . the nurse, but at the time I was delighted to be reassured,' says . Maura. 'The last thing I wanted was to stay in hospital.' Within hours of getting home she was shaking uncontrollably, a symptom known as a 'rigor' So she was . discharged as planned. But within hours of getting home she was shaking . uncontrollably, a symptom known as a 'rigor' that is associated with . serious infections. This should have been a red flag for AKI in . someone who is over 65 and has had recent surgery, says Professor Donal . O'Donoghue, a kidney specialist at Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust. Yet . when Maura's husband Gerard, 74, called their GP surgery, the doctor . insisted that the symptom was caused by the painkillers she'd been given . by the hospital - and told her to switch to paracetamol. Two days later, Maura was still suffering from uncontrollable shaking and persistent vomiting.Her . husband rang the GP, who prescribed antibiotic tablets. 'Even if I . could have kept them down, the antibiotics on their own were no help at . all - as I subsequently discovered,' says Maura. 'I also needed . intravenous fluid to hydrate the kidneys and protect them from damage.' Over the following week, three more doctors made reassuring noises as Maura became steadily more dehydrated. Eventually, her face swelled up - a sign of severe dehydration - and her husband called 999.Within an hour, an A&E doctor had diagnosed acute kidney injury and Maura was put on a drip.'I . later found out that I only had 10 per cent of kidney function left,' says Maura. Yet astonishingly, once admitted to a hospital ward, she . continued to suffer because of staff ignorance of the condition. 'No . one measured my blood or hydration levels and the drip was not . replaced. I was just told to drink, even though I still couldn't hold . anything down. The number of litres of urine filtered by the kidneys every 24 hours . 'Nor did I see a kidney specialist - even though one was on duty in the hospital that weekend. 'I just don't think anyone had a clue why I was in hospital, and no one really cared.' Maura . believes it was only by a fluke that she survived. After three days, . staff became convinced - wrongly - that she had the superbug clostridium . difficile. By then she was 'barely alive, unable to keep anything down . and with severe diarrhoea'. But a family friend put them in touch with a . kidney specialist attached to the hospital. 'If this doctor hadn't . walked into the room where I was being left to deteriorate, and insisted . on supervising my care, I'm certain I would have died,' Maura says. The . specialist saw her every day for a week, insisting on daily blood . tests, then fortnightly as an outpatient for the next three months. 'I . was anaemic due to AKI and needed blood transfusions and checks to . ensure my blood pressure was normal,' she says. Two years on, her . kidney function is now 20 per cent. She tires easily but fortunately . does not need dialysis or a kidney transplant. 'All of this was so . unnecessary,' says Professor O'Donoghue, who co-authored an official . report that highlighted the problem. 'At the point where someone has . developed a bacterial infection, it can be treated successfully with a . simple antibiotic.' Commenting on the nurse's response to Maura when . she was first discharged from hospital, he says: 'Here we have a typical . example of someone not bothering to listen to the patient. 'It's an example of the deep-rooted professional complacency about the symptoms of dehydration in healthcare today.' She was left without intravenous hydration and nearly died . The . problem, according to Dr Ed Kingdon, a kidney specialist at Brighton . & Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust, is that doctors have . traditionally focused on treating AKI when the kidneys have failed - . rather than intervening to prevent the infection spreading in the first . place. 'Medical students learn that AKI is a kidney disorder, and . once they qualify it doesn't occur to them that every patient can . develop AKI. 'Nor do they take into account that older people and . those already suffering from diabetes, heart failure, liver disease or a . kidney disorder are especially at risk.' Once AKI is suspected, . diagnosing it is quite simple. A blood test to measure levels of . creatinine (a waste product filtered out by the kidneys) shows if the . kidneys are performing. This is already a routine test carried out when . people are admitted to hospital. Dr Mark Thomas, a kidney specialist . at the Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust, explains that healthcare . professionals need to use these results and compare them with further . tests, to monitor the patient for signs of AKI. 'But too often this . isn't happening,' he says. The hope is that new guidelines, published . last year by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence . (NICE), will change this. They state that anyone over the age of 65, as . well as those admitted to hospital with a  long-term heart or liver . disorder, or who has an infection, should have their creatinine levels . monitored regularly. Maura is campaigning to make everyone more . kidney-aware. 'Doctors, nurses and patients should know that . uncontrolled shaking could be a symptom of AKI - and as such is an . emergency,' she says.'It's been truly shocking to discover that it's . quite common for doctors to ignore a disorder that's easily as . dangerous as a heart attack or stroke.'","You are more likely to get acute kidney injury (AKI) than hospital superbug .

"A young man who as a teenager was bullied by strangers in the street for being overweight has lost nine stone to become a catwalk model, and now wants to encourage other men with weight problems to do the same. Aspiring radio and TV presenter Max Eden, 20, from Cheshire, weighed 21.5 stone in 2012, and youngsters would hurl abuse - such as 'Moobs!', 'Run, Fattie, run!' and 'It's Peter Griffin!' - at him in the street. But Max decided didn't want to be known as 'the fat one' forever, so dramatically turned his life around, losing almost half his body-weight in just 18 months. Max before he lost nine stone, when children would shout insults at him in the street . Max now, left, after losing nine stone by running at night and joining a gym, and before losing the weight, right . He now weighs under 12.5 stone and feel 'the . fittest [he has] ever felt', and, having never paid much attention to fashion as a teenager, has even appeared in fashion shows in Manchester. Speaking to MailOnline, Max, who left school at the age of 16 to work in his family's delicatessen, said: 'From an early age I was never a big fan . of sport, and would usually walk around the field while others would run, . but I did not start putting on weight until about the age of . 14 or 15.' He continued: 'I left school at the age of 16 and helped . in my family's delicatessen where I was constantly surrounded by food. It was too big a temptation, and by the age of 18 I was 21.5 stone. I decided to do something about it.' Max now weighs under 12.5 stone and feel 'the fittest [he has] ever felt', and, having never paid much attention to fashion as a teenager, has even appeared in fashion shows in Manchester . Three . things inspired Max to change. 'One was on the television,' he said, 'when someone . was being interviewed and said he knew he'd never be a ""thin person"" and would always be ""the fat one"", which depressed me. I thought, I don't . want to be ""the fat one"" and forever be fat. 'The other thing that got . me to change was at a music concert, when I stood up to dance and the . people behind complained of a ""fatty blocking their view"". 'And the third was . that whenever I went out for drinks with my mother, people would think we . were a couple and that I was in my late 40s, even though I was in my . teens.' Too frightened to go to the gym for fear of being teased, Max instead went for runs at night after dark. When he did run during the day he was harassed in the street by secondary school children yelling slurs such as 'Moobs!', 'Run, Fattie, Run!', and 'It's Peter Griffin!'. Max now, holding a picture of himself before he decided to lose the weight . So Max persevered running at night, and once he had lost three stone rewarded himself with a gym membership, where he found members to be kind, welcoming and helpful rather than hostile. 'It was one of the best decisions I have ever made,' he said. 'I had built up this stereotype of gyms being for the best only and not social places, but I was wrong. I felt so welcomed and accepted and the more I trained, the better I felt. 'Now, I am under 12.5 stone and feel the fittest I have ever felt. And I, a person who never thought about fashion, have even appeared as a model in catwalk shows! 'I just hope that I can get some people who have given up to read this and give them some hope. I had given up at one point, but it is never too late. 'I hope that younger people read this and decide to can change, because it does change your life!' Just two years ago Max hated having his photograph taken, and now he is happier than ever in front of the camera, and even modelling in fashion shows . To those who don't think sport is 'their thing', Max said: 'I was the same, but I have since discovered sport again and love it. 'I think sometimes at school the sport you learn is daunting and boring, but all schools should encourage students to do any sort of sport they want, so long as it gets them active and fit.' Max is now training to be a radio and TV presenter, and would like to explore a career in modelling as well. 'How amazing that just two years ago, I would have been embarrassed to even have my photo taken!'","Max Eden, now 20, from Cheshire, weighed 21.5 stone in 2012 .

"Plans to erect a life-size Subbuteo style referee statue at the Cambridge park where the first game with modern rules was played have hit a snag after a councillor worried it may not represent minorities . A plan to mark the birthplace of modern football with a statue has fallen foul of political correctness with questions over what race and sex it should be. Councillors want to erect a life-size Subbuteo-style referee in the Cambridge park known as Parker’s Piece where students played the first game of soccer with proper rules. The £142,000 figure was due to be erected to mark this year’s 150th anniversary of the founding of the Football Association. But the project has been put on hold because issues have been raised about the model’s skin colour and sex. One councillor questioned plans to base the statue on a white man, saying it does not represent the racial minorities and women involved in the modern game. There has even been a discussion about making two statues - at three times the cost - to make sure no-one is offended. But local football bosses have condemned the row as pointless 'political correctness'. The disagreement means the 6’7” statue will not be completed until 2014 at the earliest - a year too late for the FA anniversary. The race row emerged when minutes from a Cambridge City Council meeting in June were released. Council lead for public places, Cllr Andrea Reiner said: 'I think you will have to ask the councillor who raised the issue what her concerns were exactly. 'The concerns raised about the race and gender of the referee were not the most compelling for me, but a fellow councillor raised an objection formally with officers, and I felt the project board should know about those concerns, to inform our discussion.' Score: The figures of the iconic football tabletop game Subbuteo are instantly recognisable . She added: 'A new approach to the procurement of the final artwork has been proposed, which involves obtaining expressions of interest from artists. 'We need to get this right rather than get this fast, because this public art is going to last for generations.' Kevin Satchell, chairman of Cambridge City FC, said: 'This all boils down to political correctness. 'Ten years ago no one would have a problem with putting up a white male referee statue - it’s the stereotypical image of a referee. 'I don’t see the problem, and even considering spending three times the amount to make sure they have two referee statues is just silly.' The ‘Cambridge Rules’ of football were drawn up after a student meeting at Trinity College in 1848. They included goal kicks, throw-ins and the ban on holding the ball and became the bedrock of the modern game when the FA was founded 15 years later.","A life-size Subbuteo ref is being planned at site of first modern game .

"Locals in a small Tennessee town are outraged after a 76-year-old man was arrested during a town hall hearing over a proposed pipeline because he asked board members to speak louder. Eddie Overholt's arrest came Friday after asking town board members to speak louder during a hearing to determine whether a gas company would be allowed  to build a pipeline to dump waste into a local river. ‘Okay, I’m arrested,’ Overholt can be heard saying in a baritone drawl as he is escorted out of the Greenville Town Hall during a hearing with U.S. Nitrogen, according to WATE. The company wants a pipeline to the Nolichucky River. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Mug shot: Eddie Overholt was arrested for asking local politicians to speak more loudly during a town hall meeting . Dozens of people attended the meeting, and Overholt claims regular citizens were set too far away from the moderation table to hear what was being said. ‘The board met up at the front of the room at a big table, had us roped off, and they were talking so low nobody could hear,’ Overholt told the station a few days after the arrest. Overholt insists he only asked the board to speak louder and was accused of disrupting the meeting before being cuffed and walked out. The septuagenarian was charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, he said he plans to fight the charges. He attended the meeting because he is afraid the pipeline will dump toxins into the water supply. ‘Eventually whatever they put in the river, we're going to get in our wells. Knowing it's a chemical company and a fertilizer company, we know what they put in the river,’ he told the station. 'Okay, I'm arrested': Overholt was led out of the meeting in handcuffs by two deputies . Endangered by the pipeline: Overholt insists the project will result in waste dumping into this river - and then into their drinking water . Many locals are against the project, according to WATE. The town recently rejected an application for the permits, and Friday’s hearing was to determine whether to allow them to apply again, the station reported. Overholt also claims town board member J.W. Douthat should excuse himself from voting on the project after agreeing to sell his property to the company trying to build the pipeline. Douthat disagreed, saying that he is only in favour of the project for the jobs it will bring to the community. ‘If people make good wages they live better, and we deserve to live better, and we deserve to pass it on to the future,’ he told WATE. The town voted Friday in favour of allowing the company to re-apply for the permits.","Eddie Overholt was accused of disrupting the meeting and charged with disorderly conduct .

"Woolwich murder suspect Michael Adebolajo was approached by MI5 six months ago and asked if he would work for the security service, it was claimed last night. A childhood friend of the suspected terrorist claimed MI5 started following Adebolajo after a trip to Kenya last year. Abu Nusaybah said the murder suspect believed MI5 was bugging him and 'knocking on his door'  asking for information on 'certain individuals'. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Rant: A man identified as Michael Adebolajo, 28, brandishes a meat cleaver with bloodied hands near the scene of the killing. It was claimed last night that MI5 offered Adebolajo a job six months ago . Adebolajo, right, is pictured at an English Defence League march in 2009 . MI5 is already facing criticism after it emerged Adebolajo and fellow suspect Michael Adebowale had been monitored by the security service for eight years. It is facing an inquiry by MPs amid a raft of . devastating revelations about the alleged killers’ known links to Islamist . extremism. Mr Nusaybah, speaking on the BBC's Newsnight programme last night about Abebolajo's MI5 claims, said : 'His wording was, ""They are bugging me - they won't leave me alone."" 'He mentioned initially they wanted to ask him if he knew certain individuals. 'But . after him saying that he didn't know these individuals, what he said . was they asked him if he would be interested in working for them. 'He was explicit in that he refused to work for them but he did confirm he didn't know the individuals.' Scuffle: Adebolajo is pictured clashing with police in 2006 . Interview: Abu Nusaybah, a friend of Michael Adebolajo for more than 10 years, claims MI5 tried to recruit Adebolajo as a spy . Nusaybah also said he . thought Adebolajo had undergone a 'change' following his detention by . security forces on the trip. He said Adebolajo suggested he had been . physically and sexually abused while he was interrogated in the African . country, and after this he became withdrawn and 'less talkative - he . wasn't his usual bubbly self. Following the interview Nusaybah himself was arrested at the BBC in relation to terrorism offences. The Metropolitan Police said a . 31-year-old man was arrested in relation to terrorism offences and . search warrants were executed at two addresses in east London. Career: Drummer Rigby, 25, known as 'Riggers', was known as a brave soldier . He . was held on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of . acts of terrorism and is being held in custody at a south London police . station. The arrest was not directly linked to Drummer Rigby's death, the Met said. It emerged earlier this week that . Adebolajo was so high profile he was photographed outside Paddington . Green police station six years ago behind notorious hate preacher Anjem . Choudary. He was even intercepted by officials as he attempted to travel to Somalia to fight alongside Islamist terrorists last year. It also emerged that Adebolajo was a violent ex-prisoner who was a member of a banned terrorist group. Incredibly, he was said to have been . preaching jihad on the streets of Woolwich earlier this week, only a few . hundred yards from where 25-year-old Army Drummer Lee Rigby – a married . father – was beheaded. As MI5 faced accusations that they . let the men slip through the net, David Cameron ordered a full . intelligence review by a Westminster committee. It was also claimed yesterday that Michael Adebowale became radicalised after trying to escape gangland ‘trouble’. London-born Adebowale was told to ‘disappear’ after he was caught up with a local gang known as the Woolwich Boys, and underwent a dramatic change of personality. Once a fun-loving schoolboy who was described as ‘always smiling’ and chatted to neighbours about Jamie Oliver recipes, he began dressing in traditional Islamic dress and preaching a radical message of hate. Adebowale gave up alcohol and began distributing radical leaflets near his mother’s home in Greenwich, south-east London. Neighbours . said his Nigerian-born mother, Juliet Obasuyi, was a probation officer . and a ‘hard-working’ Christian woman who raised Adebowale alone after . separating from his father. Police raided her flat and a property linked to Adebowale’s father, Adeniyi Adebowale, in Holloway, North London. Plain-clothes officers were seen carrying six plastic bags full of video cassettes and audio tapes from the Holloway flat. Cold-blooded: Michael Adebowale, 22, of Greenwich, south-east London, with a knife in his hand after he had hacked Lee Rigby to death . Shock: A friend of Adebowale, 22, who has known him from the age of 11, said today that he converted to Islam when he was aged around 19 . The . videos appeared to be labelled as football matches but one line of . inquiry for police is likely to be whether Adebowale was interested in . the type of jihadi videos watched by the July 2005 London bombers. The four bombers were linked to an . extreme bookshop in Leeds which distributed videos of terrorist acts, . exhorting followers to emulate them. Michael Oluwatobi Adebowale was born . to Nigerian parents in Denmark Hill, South London, in May 1991. His . father was then a student at Rutherford College in Canterbury, Kent, and . the couple were said to have separated soon after the birth. Adebowale . attended Kidbrooke School in Greenwich, where former pupils said he was . known as Toby or Tobi, an abbreviation of his second name Oluwatobi. Probe: Police leave the block of flats that Michael Adebowale is believed to have lived in holding envelopes with evidence . Luqman Ciise said on Twitter: ‘I knew him personally, he was normal, smiling all the time. His name was Toby. Still can’t believe this . . . How did he get radicalised?’ Adebowale was said to have converted to Islam at 19, while studying at Greenwich University, where he met the other Woolwich suspect, Michael Adebolajo. Family friend Madeleine Edwards, 49, said Adebowale had been in ‘some serious gangland trouble’ in 2010 and that his mother had told her he ‘had to disappear for a while’. She said Adebowale’s father was a ‘typical African gentleman’ but his mother had struggled to control her wayward son. Adebowale was said to have left the . Greenwich area for a year and returned about eight months ago, wearing . traditional Islamic garb and a white skull cap, typically worn by Muslim . men who have been on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. A . neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: ‘Michael would always say . hello and play with my children, but in the last year he stopped. He . would just ignore us when we saw him at the lift. ‘He used to talk to me very enthusiastically about cooking and his recipes. He loved Jamie Oliver and had his books. Detectives guard the fourth floor flat, which neighbours said they often heard Muslim songs from and confirm that they saw both the suspects there . ‘But more recently, he would just put . his head down when he saw me. Even if I tried to talk to him he was . very dismissive. I thought it was weird. ‘It was odd as his mother was a devout Christian. And it seemed like such a sudden change.’ In recent months Adebowale had begun . seeing a woman who had converted to Islam two years ago and wore a . headscarf to cover her hair. Armed police raided her flat, also in Greenwich, and led away two women and a 15-year-old boy, who witnesses said was handcuffed. Two toddlers and a baby were also said to have been taken from the property. Angels of Woolwich: Gemini Donnelly-Martin, 20, and her mother Amanda (right) talk to Adebolajo while Ingrid Loyau-Kennett (left) talks to the Adebowale as Lee Rigby lies dead in the road . Adebolajo and Adebowale mowed down Lee Rigby in this car before hacking him to death in the street in front of horrified onlookers. The streak of blood in front of the car shows how they dragged his body into the street . Neighbours described hearing regular prayers and chanting from the flat. A friend who has known Adebowale since he was 11 spoke of his shock at seeing the video of the Woolwich atrocity. The man, who asked to remain anonymous, told ITV’s Daybreak: ‘That wasn’t the same person. ‘He wasn’t someone monstrous, that was not the same person. ‘He . converted to Islam, preaching Islam, preaching peace. Not preaching . anything bad or anything negative. Just literally the ways of Islam. ‘I would see him going to mosque and coming back from mosque. ‘He was completely normal . . . He was one of us at school. Nothing evil about him at all.’ Watch the full BBC interview here .

"A new £30million academy has opened directly opposite a seedy sex club, complete with leather-clad clientele, a mock torture wheel and a fully-equipped dungeon. North Durham Academy, which opened this month in Stanley, county Durham, boasts of its state-of-the-art design, with classrooms kitted out with projectors, interactive whiteboards and brand new science labs. But its prospectus fails to mention the business just opposite - Clubf - which describes itself as the best sex club in the north east. Contrast: Newly-opened North Durham Academy, left, is just across the road from the Spa Hotel, which houses swingers' joint Clubf . The club, which appears from the outside to be 'The Spa Hotel' was subject to vigorous resistance from local residence when its true intentions became apparent in 2004. The addition of a school just cross the road has intensified the protests. The website - which does not openly disclose the club's location - lists the club's facilities, including a dance floor complete with pole, a sauna and steam room, a 'public play area'. The underground dungeon is also shown, featuring leather and chains, padded tables and a man-sized wheel to which guests can be strapped. The club, which opens from 8pm most evenings, urges its visitors to be discreet, but locals still campaign against the establishment, which they say is 'unsuitable' for the location, and creates disturbances. Ann Hilde, a member of a local residents' campaign, said said: 'From day one we feared this would happen. What started out as an event on a Saturday night at the spa has become a series of party nights on Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. State-of-the-art: Clubf is just around the corner from the £30million North Durham Academy . Unassuming: Clubf does not openly display itself, and urges customer to be discreet . 'There are problems with cars parking in the area and visitors leaving in the early hours of the morning are causing a noise disturbance. When the windows are open I can hear all sorts.' Retired factory worker, 66-year-old grandmother Edith Errington, has lived nearby for the past 26 years has noted the exotic visitors to the site. She said: 'Sometimes the people are dressed up in skirts up to here, both men and women, or PVC or as tarts and vicars but other times you just see them carrying a plastic bag in with them. Campign: John and Edith Errington have said that Clubf's presence is 'unsuitable' in light of the new academy . 'Some of them look sheepish but others aren’t bothered. You hear all kinds of stories.' Her husband John said: 'It should be shifted.

"One might be forgiven for thinking these incredible pictures are photographs, but they are in fact the work of a British artist who paints street scenes that look like the real thing. Darren Reid has only been painting for three years, but in that time he has managed to create these intricate pieces of artwork of life in his home town of Derby in the East Midlands. And in print, or even in front of your eyes, it is difficult to spot the difference between the paintings and what might be a photograph. Scroll down for video . This picture by Darren Reid might look like a photograph but it is actually a painting, entitled Cross the Tracks, of London Road bridge, Derby . His style is known as contemporary realism and surprisingly, the 44-year-old is completely self-taught. Now his paintings are being snapped up by art collectors for four-figure sums - almost before the paint is dry on the canvas - after he was shortlisted for this year's John Ruskin Prize. The artist says he only turned his hand to painting after his dog, a cross-collie called Tubs, fell ill in 2011 and he spent hours at home nursing him. He said: 'I was always good at art at school but when I left at 15 it wasn't something I looked to pursue directly. Instead, I became involved in making signs. His style of work is known as contemporary realism and originates from a line drawing of a photograph and then is painstakingly painted. This painting is of the Holiday Inn in Derby, where Darren Reid chooses to recreate familiar images of his hometown . Low Winter Sun, another incredibly realistic painting of a Derby high street by Darren, which was shortlisted for the John Ruskin Prize this year . 'I never yearned to be able to paint in the intervening years and I don't think I'd have been ready to do the art I'm now doing 20 years ago.' The first painting that Mr Reid tackled was of former cotton mill, Darley Abbey Mills in Derby - a building with which he is very familiar with - choosing to specifically feature the fire escape. He said: 'I capture the scene I intend to paint by taking a photograph initially. But then it is down to me to adjust the scene as I see fit. 'For example, the John Ruskin entry is of St Peter's Street in Derby but people looking at it will realise the street is narrower than it would be in reality. 'And in Crossing The Tracks, which is a view looking across Derby's railway station, the angles are altered. 'The temporary bridge should be at more of a 90-degree angle but I wanted to use it to lead the eye along and into the painting more, so I reduced the angle.' His paintings are now being snapped up by collectors willing to pay four-figure sums for the pieces. Pictured: The Things We Leave Behind . Acrylic painting There Has To Be More Than This, has already sold to a private collector in London after he was shortlisted for a national award . To create his pieces, Mr Reid painstakingly creates a line drawing of the scene he will eventually paint. He takes up his brush and paints in every detail, including shadows, puddles and reflections - and each one takes about 250 hours. He said: 'A couple of things happened after I finished the first painting. I had it accepted for exhibition at Duffield Art Gallery and also entered the Derbyshire Open Art competition, where I was commended. 'James Preston, at Duffield Art Gallery, was keen to put my first five paintings on display and within 10 months they had sold for prices ranging from £1,200 to £1,800, which absolutely amazed me.' Darren Reid, who is completely self-taught, only took up painting three years ago after his dog, Tubs, fell ill in 2011 and he had time at home .","Darren Reid, 44, has created these intricate and realistic paintings of his home town of Derby in the East Midlands .

"Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg is planning to mount a challenge for one of California's two U.S. Senate seats, most likely the one held by Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer, MailOnline can reveal today. Sandberg is among the wealthiest women in America – her reported net worth is $1.05 billion – making the $30 or $40 million required to win the seat easily within her reach without raising a dime from anyone. 'Sheryl . wants to find a seat before the election in 2016, when Hillary Clinton . will likely run for president,' a source close to Sandberg's inner circle told MailOnline. When MailOnline contacted Sandberg yesterday there was no comment. However, this morning a source close to her said that 'it is 100 per cent untrue.' Scroll down for video . Bruising: A run at Barbara Boxer's seat would spell problems for Hillary Clinton, who is expected to run for president in 2016. It would force her to choose sides between the two women she has been close to. However, a source close to Sandberg today told MailOnline the claims are '100 per cent untrue' 2016 is the year Sen. Boxer will stand . for re-election. Dianne Feinstein, the state's other senator, won't . face another contest until 2018, but she could retire by then – leaving . an open seat. Sandberg, MailOnline's source said, isn't likely to wait that long. A bruising fight between two ambitious women would force Hillary Clinton to choose sides, between her former colleague in the U.S. Senate and the woman who managed the day-to-day operation of the Treasury Department during Bill Clinton's second term in the White House. Sandberg was chief of staff to Treasury Secretary Larry Summers from 1996 until the Clintons left Washington. The 44-year-old married mother of two helped lead Treasury’s work on forgiving debt in the developing world during the Asian financial crisis. As her footprint grew, so did her influence. Forbes lists her as the world's sixth-most powerful woman, right behind Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton. U.S.House Minority Leader and former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi ranks #22. Barbara Boxer didn't make the list at all. Sandberg, the Miami-born executive whose book 'Lean In' is a call to arms for ambitious women in the workplace, has already faced questions about whether a run for political office is her inevitable next step. When asked about her plans at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland in January, she appeared to rule out a move from Silicon Valley to Capitol Hill. Asked, 'Is politics for you?' she replied: 'Not for me. I just have a wholesale agreement that we need more women in politics.' Rival: Barbara Boxer's seat in California is up for re-election in 2016. Sandberg made it as sixth on the Forbes list of most powerful women. Boxer didn't make it . But the source waved off Sandberg's dismissal: 'Don't believe it. Sheryl has everything planned. She's the kind of woman who doesn't look five years ahead, she looks 15.' 'She sees politics as her future, definitely. This is what she has mapped out. She has spent her life courting the most powerful people in the country and she's an incredibly smart and focused woman – she knows what she wants.' California is a decidedly blue state, making Democrats' control of U.S. Senate seats a near shoo-in. Boxer, 73, won her last three elections by 10, 20 and 10 percentage points, including her easy 2010 victory over Republican Carly Fiorina, the former CEO and chairwoman of Hewlett-Packard. That election cost $28 million for Boxer to win, in a year where there was no simultaneous presidential contest driving up the price of running TV and radio ads. But she is used to deploying most of her campaign cash in the general election, not in a hotly contested primary that could weaken her and leave her cash-poor just in time for Republicans to start attacking. The net effect of a Sandberg-Boxer slugfest could be an easier playing field for a Republican Senate hopeful, a Missouri GOP consultant told MailOnline. 'That's always what we look for,' said the campaign operative, who asked not to be named. 'When two evenly matched liberals punch each other silly, and money is no object for at least one of them, it's the best scenario possible for us come November – as long as we can all get behind a single candidate ourselves.' California now has a so-called 'blanket' primary, in which all the candidates – regardless of party – jockey for position in the hope of emerging as one of the top two vote-getters. Those two then slug it out in a November runoff. Inspiration: Sandberg has written 'Lean In', a call to arms for ambitious women in the workplace so a dramatic move into politics would not come as a huge surprise . A move from the executive suite to government's elite would fit with the central message of Sandberg's book, that women need to push themselves in order to get ahead and realize their full potential. That platform, already a blueprint for rallying career women, will require government to 'lean in' as well, she says, in order to create an environment that will allow working mothers to create their own solutions to workplace inequalities. 'There's a chicken-and-egg going on,' she said during a Davos session on gender-driven growth. 'We need better public and corporate policies. We need more women in leadership roles to get those policies.' Sandberg may have decided that she has to roll up her sleeves and start tinkering with federal law herself. 'Sheryl is going to make a statement about her future soon,' another source told MailOnline. Sandberg's wealth and her coterie of powerful friends would give her instant credibility if she were to put Boxer on notice more than two years before the 2016 elections. And her base of operations in tony San Mateo County near Stanford University would serve her well in a statewide campaign. In August she and her family moved into their new compound in Menlo Park, just minutes from Facebook's headquarters. Their sprawling 9,210-square-foot home features a gym, movie theater and even a basketball court for her young children. Currently Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's right-hand woman, Sandberg was lured to the social network site in 2008 from Google, where she had been vice president of global online sales & operations since 2001. In 2012, the Harvard-educated businesswoman became the eighth member – and the first female member – of Facebook's board of directors. In August she sold 2.4 million Facebook shares worth $91 million, just five per cent of her total stake in the company. David Goldberg, the CEO of SurveyMonkey, is Sandberg's second husband. They maintain a low-key personal life, something that would change instantly if she were to dive headlong into American politics.","Sandberg, one of the business world's biggest champions of correcting gender inequality in the workplace, is eying a rebellion against Democratic Californian Senator Barbara Boxer .

"A technique aimed at helping you access deeper parts of your consciousness through accelerated deep breathing is being hailed as the latest spiritual tool for enlightenment after appearing in new web comedy Be Here Nowish. The practice of Holotropic Breathwork was developed in Big Sur, California, in the 1970s, by psychiatrist Stanislav Grof and his wife Christina, and involves, according to the couple: 'Accelerated breathing, evocative music, and a technique of bodywork that helps to release residual bioenergetic and emotional blocks.' Such hyperventilating - under the guidance of a trained group - is considered an effective way of going into a trance to access deeper parts of yourself, of releasing past traumas and even getting high without drugs. Holotropic Breathwork is always done in pairs, with one person as the 'breather' and the other as the 'sitter' Holotropic Breathing was referenced by Natalia Leite and Alexandra Roxo, creators of Be Here Nowish, as one of the new age practices used in spirituality circles in LA . The practice has been acclaimed by Be Here Nowish creators and stars Natalia Leite and Alexandra Roxo in an interview with the Sunday Times Style magazine, along with colon hydrotherapy, urine therapy, sexual energy crystals, past-life regression and vision quests, which involve venturing out into the woods and fasting all on your own. In a Holotropic Breathwork, clients work in pairs, with one as the 'breather' and the other as the 'sitter'. The breather lies on a mat, closes their eyes and begins to breathe faster and deeper, while the sitter ensures they are safe and supported during the session. The breather's accelerated breath will gradually bring on a non-ordinary state of consciousness - an hallucination or vivid dream - and they are free to stay still or move as they wish. Sessions last three hours, then the breather and sitter swap roles. Accelerated breathing, evocative music, and a technique of bodywork helps release residual bioenergetic and emotional blocks . The practice of Holotropic Breathwork was . developed in Big Sur, California, in the 1970s, by psychiatrist . Stanislav Grof, left, and his wife Christina, right . Grof, who has spent over forty years researching non-ordinary states of consciousness induced by both psychedelic substances and non-drug techniques, is one of the founders and chief theoreticians of transpersonal psychology. In his book Healing Our Deepest Wounds: The Holotropic Paradigm Shift, Grof writes: 'Holotropic Breathwork combines very simple means - faster breathing, evocative music, and releasing bodywork - to induce intense holotropic states of consciousness; it uses the remarkable healing and transformative power of these states. 'This method provides access to biographical, perinatal, and transpersonal domains of the unconscious and thus to deep psychospiritual roots of emotional and psychosomatic disorders. 'It also makes it possible to utilize the mechanisms of healing and personality transformation that operate on these levels of the psyche. 'The process of self-exploration and therapy in Holotropic Breathwork is spontaneous and autonomous; it is governed by inner healing intelligence rather than following the instructions and guidelines of a particular school of psychotherapy.'

"British scientists have made a breakthrough in treating one of Britain’s most deadly cancers. When patients with bladder tumours that were thought to be untreatable were given a new drug, many of their tumours shrank and in some cases disappeared completely. In some cases the cancer disappeared completely. One man is still free of the disease, a year after starting treatment. Chemotherapy produces debilitating side-effects but in contrast the new drug produced ‘striking’ results and has few side-effects . Bladder cancer is Britain’s seventh most common cancer, but research into it has been largely neglected and there have been no new treatments for 30 years. It is also one of the biggest cancer killers, with more than 5,000 deaths a year – or 14 a day. One in ten cases are not spotted until the disease has spread from the bladder to another part of the body and these patients tend to only live for 12 to 18 months after diagnosis. With chemotherapy having limited benefit but producing debilitating side-effects, many patients decide to forgo it in favour of making the most of their remaining months. Others are too elderly or too ill to cope with the toxic cocktail of drugs used. In contrast, the new drug produced ‘striking’ results and has few side-effects, the journal Nature reports. Researcher Tom Powles, of Queen Mary University of London, said the new drug ‘revolutionised’ the lives of patients in a trial. Many bladder tumours have a protein that switches off the immune system. The new drug, known only as MPDL3280A, turns the immune system back on – which then attacks the cancer. In a trial at Barts Cancer Institute in London involving patients with supposedly untreatable cancer, the drug shrank tumours in more than half of those with the protein. Surprisingly, it also helped some of the patients whose tumours didn’t have the protein, the journal Nature reports. Dr Powles, of Queen Mary University of London, said: ‘We have had people who have been told to go away because there are not treatment options for them and the cancer has completely disappeared or reduced in size. The drug, which has few side effects, is unlikely to be available until the ongoing trial stage is completed. A second, larger, trial has just finished and a third is about to begin. It shows promise for fighting a range of other cancers, including bowel and skin cancers. Professor Peter Johnson, of Cancer Research UK, said: 'It’s really good to find a new treatment for a type of cancer that we’ve been struggling to make progress with for many years’ However, the drugs watchdog in the US was so impressed by Dr Powles’ results that it may not wait for all the results before giving the go ahead for the drug’s use. European authorities are likely to want all the data before approving it, meaning it is several years from the market here. The medicine, which is given through a drip every three weeks, is being developed by Roche, the Swiss firm behind breast cancer ‘wonder drug’ Herceptin. It shows promise against a range of other cancers, including bowel and skin cancer, but seems to work best on the bladder. Professor Peter Johnson, of Cancer Research UK, said: ‘Cancer can only grow by finding a way to escape detection by the immune system. One way it does this is to trigger a shut-off switch on immune cells when they get close to the tumour. ‘This new treatment blocks the cancer cell’s ability to use this switch, allowing the immune system to recognise and destroy the cancer. ‘It’s really good to find a new treatment for a type of cancer that we’ve been struggling to make progress with for many years.’","Patients with 'untreatable' bladder tumours were given new drug .

"A lifelong vegetarian told she would never have children has given birth to triplets after she started eating meat. Laura Dixon, 34, turned to IVF after trying for ten years to  get pregnant naturally, but during her second cycle of treatment she  suffered a miscarriage. When she became pregnant during her final round of IVF, she was warned she had a high risk of another miscarriage or a dangerously early labour. Laura Dixon (pictured with husband, Tim) conceived the triplets, Mason, Max and Mia, after her third and final cycle of IVF. She says she was terrified that her body would not be able to cope with carrying three babies . So she started eating three portions of meat a day to increase her intake of iron, vitamin B12 and protein to improve her chances of a healthy pregnancy. Mrs Dixon, who had never eaten meat, tucked into chicken, bacon and sausages every day and at 35 weeks gave birth to identical boys Max and Mason and daughter Mia. Naturally slim, she piled on more than five stone gorging on chicken, bacon and burgers as well as a daily McDonald's breakfast and a sausage and egg McMuffin. Her meat cravings became so strong she was tucking into three portions of meat a day with a Marks and Spencer chicken and stuffing salad sandwich her favourite snack. The high protein diet carried her pregnancy through to 35 weeks when she gave birth to identical boys Max and Mason, and daughter Mia. Mrs Dixon's first attempt at IVF had to be abandoned because her ovaries became dangerously swollen. She conceived after the second cycle but had a miscarriage when she was eight weeks pregnant . When she was pregnant with the triplets, Mrs Dixon decided to ditch her vegetarian diet to give herself the best chance of a successful pregnancy. She started craving meat and ate three portions a day . Ms Dixon, a PA from Essex, said: ‘When the sonographer found a third heartbeat I remember shouting “oh no” and crying - thinking I'd lose them all. ‘After losing one baby to a miscarriage, I thought I would never be able to carry three. ‘But then my hunger kicked in and despite never eating meat, I craved it. I ate about six meals a day. ‘It all seems like a blur now. I just remember the cravings were so strong that I would wake up in the night and make my husband go and get me a McDonald's. Mrs Dixon said that her meat cravings became so strong that she had to get her husband, Tim, to go out and buy her McDonald's and Nandos - sometimes in the middle of the night . During the pregnancy, Mrs Dixon put on five stone. She says that her favourite snack was a Marks and Spencer chicken and stuffing sandwich . ‘Several times my husband had to go up to Nandos for chicken and chips with me. ‘Eating meat definitely helped me get all the protein you need when you're pregnant. ‘I think it could be one of the reasons I managed to carry all three to full term.’ Ms Dixon was diagnosed with endometriosis and polycystic ovaries which doctors told her would stop her getting pregnant. Thanks to her high protein diet, Mrs Dixon carried the triplets until she was 35 weeks pregnant. They were then delivered by C-section. Max and Mason are identical . Mrs Dixon had both polycystic ovary syndrome and endometriosis and doctors believed this would prevent her conceiving as both conditions can cause infertility . Endometriosis is a condition which causes cells from the lining of the womb to develop outside of the uterine cavity. It causes pain and, often, infertility. Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common condition that affects how a woman's ovaries work. It causes cysts to develop in the ovaries, stops the regular release of eggs, and causes the body to produce high levels of 'male hormones' called androgens. She underwent two laparoscopies in a bid to correct the problems but both were unsuccessful. Since the triplets were born, the couple have gone through 8,000 nappies and done more than 10,000 feeds . Her first cycle of IVF failed when she developed dangerously swollen ovaries and treatment had to be abandoned. She became pregnant during the second cycle using frozen eggs but miscarried at eight weeks. During the third IVF attempt she got ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome but decided to proceed at her own risk and two fertilised eggs developed. Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome can occur after taking medications that stimulate the ovaries. It causes the ovaries to swell and produce too many follicles. Max (left) was born weighing 3lb 12oz, Mason (right) was 5lb 4oz and Mia (centre) weighed 5lb 15oz - all three were born by C-section within a minute of each other . Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and bloating. In severe cases it can be life-threatening as it can cause a blood clot in an artery or vein, kidney and liver dysfunction and breathing difficulties. However, on her 33rd birthday Mrs Dixon and her husband heard three little heartbeats and on Mr Dixon’s 33rd birthday doctors told them they were expecting identical boys and a girl. Max was born weighing 3lb 12oz, Mason was 5lb 4oz and Mia weighed 5lb 15oz - all three were born by C-section within a minute of each other. Since becoming a mother, Mrs Dixon has continued to go to McDonald's - but has reverted to her vegetarian diet and only has a veggie-wrap and fries . The triplets, now 14 months, were allowed home from hospital just two weeks after their birth. Since then Mrs Dixon and Mr Dixon, 34, a finance manager, have gone through 8,000 nappies and done more than 10,000 feeds. Medics believe Mrs Dixon’s protein boost will have contributed to her successful pregnancy. Nutritionist Jo Travers, who runs The London Nutritionist, said: ‘There is a lot of evidence that women experience taste changes throughout the pregnancy, which in turn can alter their preferences as they progress through the trimesters.’ Since becoming a mother Ms Dixon has continued to go to McDonald's - but has reverted to her vegetarian diet and only has a veggie-wrap and fries.","Laura Dixon had IVF after trying to conceive naturally for 10 years .

"A Manhattan banking bigwig has accused his ex-wife of trying to make their 16-year-old son gay 'to get back at him.' New York real estate broker Danica Cordell-Reeh has asked a judge for total decision-making power over her son after her estranged ex-husband Henry Owsley allegedly complained of her manipulation to the boy's California boarding school administrators. The revelation is the latest in a string of dramatic episodes between the former high school sweethearts that began with their divorce ten years ago when Owsley falsely accused Cordell-Reeh of molesting their children.

A hearing has been set for September to discuss the newest accusations. Cordell-Reeh's attorney says Owsley told the the boy's school that his ex-wife was forcing their children to have seances to summon a dead relative and that she's 'trying to make her son gay in order to get back at him.' A separate attorney representing the boy told the New York Post that he's 'trying to find himself.' Owsley, now CEO of boutique investment bank The Gordon Group, is already suing ex-wife Cordell-Reeh for nearly $3 million – the $263,000 he says she stole and another $2.5 million in punitive damages, according to court documents. Their 2000 separation agreement required Owsley to reimburse his former spouse for nanny expenses for the couple’s twins, as well as child support, private school tuition and health care, the New York Daily News reported. Owsley abided by the agreement despite being told by his children there was hardly ever a caretaker around, according to the suit. Two years ago Owsley claims Cordell-Reeh spent nearly $180,000 given to her for a nanny without ever having hired one. Cordell-Reeh’s attorney told the Daily News he was ‘quite surprised. ‘Her children are turning 18 in January, and he wants to get involved in 10 more years of litigation.’","Former Goldman Sachs executive Henry Owsley and ex Danica Cordell-Reeh split in 2000 .

"At first glance you might think the otherworldly light in these pictures comes from a nebula or another planet deep in outer space. In fact it is made by burning sulphur which pours from the side of the Kawah Ijen volcano on planet Earth, which is part of the Ijen volcano complex in East Java, Indonesia. Miners have run ceramic pipes from vents in the side of the mountain to collection points inside a large crater where the molten chemical is left to cool before being broken up and carried away. Out of this world: While these pictures may appear to be from another planet, they are in fact produced by burning sulphur here on Earth . The molten chemical comes from the sides of the Kawah Ijen volcano in Indonesia and is directed through pipes by miners to collection points in a nearby crater . While the sulhpur appears bright red during the day, at night it gives off an eerie blue light with flames that can reach up to five foot in height. The miners who rely on the sulphur for their livelihoods work in treacherous conditions at the bottom of the crater. They wear nothing other than t-shirts and trousers as they collect the yellow material, despite toxic fumes being given off and the fact that the molten sulphur is heated to more than 240F. They must also avoid the deadly turquoise-blue lake which takes up most of the crater floor, as it is made up of almost pure sulphuric acid, and would instantly kill anyone unlucky enough to fall in. Once the chemical element has cooled the miners break off blocks weighing up to 220lb and haul it away by hand in order for it to be sold . The sulphur appears bright red during the day, but as the sun sets the blue flames  - which can reach up to five foot in height - start to become visible . They must also move solid blocks of sulphur weighing up to 220lb up a very steep slope in order to sell them, using nothing more than a basket and their bare hands. Photographer Olivier Grunewald, who captured some of these amazing shots, had to wear a gas mask during his expedition into the crater, and lost two lenses and a camera while trying to capture the mysterious pictures.","Kawah Ijen volcano in East Java, Indonesia, produces molten suphur which leaks from its sides .

"A Florida man convicted of killing his ex-girlfriend's baby by throwing the three-month-old out of a moving car while speeding down a highway has been sentenced to life in prison. Richard McTear was found guilty last week of first-degree murder, kidnapping, battery and aggravated child abuse charges. Following a jury's recommendation, a Hillsborough County judge sentenced the 26-year-old to life in prison yesterday. Prosecutors had been seeking the death penalty. Richard McTear (pictured listening to the judge during his trial yesterday) has been sentenced to life in prison after being convicted of killing his ex-girlfriend's baby boy . Jasmine Bedwell pictured before she speaks to the judge after the jury returned their sentence recommendation during the trial of McTear at the George E. Edgecomb Courthouse in Tampa yesterday . Authorities say McTear took the child after attacking ex-girlfriend Jasmine Bedwell in 2009. They say he then threw the baby, Emanuel Wesley Murray, out of a car window on Interstate 275 in Tampa. The child was found dead along the side of the highway. Prosecutors claimed during the trial the killing was 'the ultimate act of revenge' against Bedwell, who had sidled up to a new man in the days before the killing, according to reports. The jury deliberated for about seven hours before handing down the guilty verdict in the murder charge and also on counts of kidnapping, battery and aggravated child abuse. The guilty verdict came despite McTear's public defender arguing during the trial that there was no evidence definitively showing he had thrown the baby onto the road. 'There's no clear explanation of how that baby got to the side of that road,' Assistant Public Defender Mike Peacock said in his closing argument, according to the Tampa Bay Times. McTear's attorney is shown putting a tie on the now-convicted killer during his trial . He made this statement despite the child's blood having been found on both McTear and on a car seat. Jurors cried when shown pictures of the dead child, the Times reported. McTear's previous trial was declared a mistrial after Bedwell insisted the then-17-year-old man threatened to kill her son. It was not the first time she made the accusation. The victim: Three-month-old Emanuel Murray died after being thrown from a moving car on a busy Florida highway . Bedwell's claim that her ex-boyfriend threatened to shoot her and her son and urinate on the child came up originally in a 2010 trial where McTear was found not guilty of battering her. Prior to the commencement of that previous trial, the court ruled the phone call with the threat should not be introduced because it was part of a previous trial - where McTear was ultimately acquitted for assault - and was therefore irrelevant in the murder case. But Bedwell gasped out the allegation amid tears as soon as she took the stand during the eventual mistrial. Assistant State Attorney Ron Gale had asked Bedwell about phone calls from McTear the day before Emanuel's death. Bedwell replied saying McTear had called her and 'told me that he was going to come over and shoot my baby in the face and p*** on him, in his face, and he was going to kill both of us.' Gale acknowledged Bedwell's testimony was 'clearly... a violation' of the court order but he said he had not expected her to refer to the phone call, which took place about six weeks before her son's death. However, he added that he had not specifically told her not to mention in their preparations for testimony. 'It did not come up,' Gale said. McTear's lawyer argued that there was not enough evidence to show his client was responsible for the baby's death. Prosecutors claim McTear entered Bedwell's apartment by force in May, 2009 and beat her before throwing the baby carrier against the wall while the child was inside it, ABC Action News reported. He then allegedly drove off with the child and threw him out onto the motorway. An off-duty TV cameraman spotted the child's body lying by the side of the motorway in Tampa. Devastated mother: Jasmine Bedwell, pictured center in 2009, previously said she wanted McTear to face the death penalty . Jason Bird said he thought it was a toy doll - until he saw the baby's eyes. A huge manhunt was launched for McTear who had previous convictions for domestic violence and other violent crimes. He was found hiding at a friend's house several hours after the incident and was arrested by police. Bedwell, who was then 17, told police her ex-boyfriend grabbed her son and threw him down onto the pavement. He then picked him up in his carrier and raced off. Police were about to issue an Amber Alert until the baby's body was found by the side of I-275, the main motorway leading into Tampa on Florida's Gulf Coast. Bedwell's claim that her ex-boyfriend threatened to shoot her and her son and urinate on the child came up originally in a 2010 trial where McTear was found not guilty of battering her. Bedwell is pictured, left, in 2009 . TV cameraman Bird, who was on his way to work for a local station, said: 'Just out of the corner of my eye, I thought I saw some trash on the side of the road. But the more I thought about it, I saw eyes. 'It flipped me out, and I started shaking and said, ""It's a doll, a baby doll"".' Police in Florida said at the time that Bedwell had previously sought a court injunction to keep McTear away from her family. The matter was dropped, though, after she failed to turn up for a court hearing.","Richard McTear has been sentenced to life in prison after being found guilty last week of first-degree murder and other charges .

"Federal aviation authorities are prohibiting U.S. airlines and other commercial carriers from flying over Iraq as U.S. bombing missions begin. The FAA announced the ban Friday, citing the 'potentially hazardous situation' created by fighting between militants and Iraqi security forces and their allies as U.S. military planes begin strategic airstrikes against the Islamic State. The ban applies to all U.S.-registered planes except those operated by foreign carriers and to FAA-licensed pilots and comes only one day after President Obama authorized the attacks.

There is an exception for flights operated with U.S. government permission and for emergency situations. Obama announced Thursday evening that targeted attacks on Islamic State strongholds battering Kurdish forces in the northern part of the country would soon begin. Two 500-pound, laser-guided bombs were dropped on enemy artillery equipment Friday morning near the Kurdish capital or Erdil, according to the Pentagon. The target was U.S.-made and had been abandoned by Iraqi Army soldiers that fled as their position was overrun by militants, according to reports. The FAA previously had limited flights over Iraq to altitudes no lower than 30,000 feet. The ban comes just three weeks after a Malaysia Airlines plane with nearly 300 people on board was shot down over eastern Ukraine as tensions between Russia and the former Soviet satellite republic continue to escalate.","Authorities announced the ban Friday morning only hours after the Pentagon confirmed two U.S. bombs were dropped over northern Iraq .

"It may not be streamlined enough to  nip through traffic, but this solar-powered electric bike will at least make hills easier to climb. A Dutch inventor came up with the the Maxun One so he could ride through the mountains effortlessly, and his bike travels at speeds of 14mph (22km/h) without a battery. It features large solar panels in front and behind the saddle and these are used to charge the bike as its being used. The Maxun One (pictured) was designed by Dutch engineer Albert van Dalen. It features solar panels in front of, and behind, the saddle that measure 1.6ft (0.5 metres) each, and these are used to constantly charge the bike as its being ridden . Each of the panels measures 1.6ft (0.5 metres). In theory, because they are constantly charging, it means the bike never runs out of energy, and Mr van Dalen claims to have clocked more than 1,000 miles (1,609km) in the past three months . The 56-year-old software engineer from Maastricht in the Netherlands said: ‘I used to have a motorcycle that I made trips through Belgium's Ardennes mountains on. ‘I decided I wanted to do the same with an electric bike - cycling with a normal bicycle is too exhausting in that kind of terrain.' Each of the panels measures 1.6ft (0.5 metres). In theory, because they panels are constantly charging, it means the bike never runs out of energy, and Mr van Dalen (picutred) claims to have clocked more than 1,000 miles (1,609km) in the past three months . The handmade bike (pictured) has been patented and only 50 of the bikes will be built and sold, for £80,000 ($126,000) each. Mr van Dalen experimented with different sized panels before settling on ones large enough to provide enough energy, but small enough to ride in traffic . He admitted that he finds traditional electric bikes ugly, and began wondering if it would be possible to cycle entirely on solar energy. ‘Some solar bikes were available, but they all used a large trailer for the solar panels and I wanted my bike to be handy in traffic and effortless to ride, even in the absence of sun,' continued Mr van Dalen. A German designer recently unveiled an electric bike made entirely from wood. The so-called 'ebike' was built by Matthias Broda, and has a rechargeable motor that helps with pedalling. The development team, which included students from the University for Sustainable Development Eberswalde, now has a working prototype together which it is testing in Berlin. The designers said they set out to make a new vehicle which would significantly reduce the carbon footprint of more traditional, metal bikes. But the wooden vehicle comes with a price tag of £3,000 ($4,730). ‘I imagined how great it would be to cycle just on solar energy without pedalling - just like sailing in the wind. ‘People in my field all said that a bicycle on solar energy was not possible but that didn't put me off, in fact it encouraged me to develop the solar bike. The handmade bike has been patented and will be tested to enter the Guinness World Records next summer. Only 50 of the bikes will be built and sold, for £80,000 ($126,000) each. Mr van Dalen taught himself about carbon composites and solar cells since starting the project in 2010. He experimented with different sized solar panels until settling on some large enough to provide enough energy, but small enough to ride in traffic. Without pedalling or using the battery, the sun delivers the energy for a speed that averages 14mph (20km/h) but can go faster. ‘This shows how powerful the sun is,’ continued Mr van Dalen. ‘The solar panels may seem large at first glance, but the Maxun One is easy to handle in traffic and the solar panels perform particularly well, even on semi-cloudy days.’ ‘I always watch out when the weather is sunny so I can ride my solar bike again. ‘I do find it funny when Japanese people pass by, they say: here they already have solar bikes, which we have not got back home yet.’","Maxun One features solar panels in front of, and behind, the saddle .

"Women are still paid less then men across the UK and Europe for doing exactly the same job, damning figures reveal. Hourly pay rates for women across Europe are on average 16 per cent lower than for men doing the same work and 19.5 per cent lower in the UK, latest figures reveal today. The gap was highlighted on the eve of European Equal Pay Day - a moveable annual event marked this year on February 28 - the 59th day of the year reflecting the number of extra days women must work to earn 'equal' pay. Regardless of whether they do the same job, men get paid more on average than their female counterparts . The situation is improving, the European Commission hastened to point out today: the first Equal Pay Day, in 2011, was held on March 5 and last year it was on March 2. That reflects a closing of the pay gap from 17.5 per cent to 16. per cent over three years with today’s latest figures reflecting the position across Europe in 2010. The biggest gender pay gap is nearly 28 per cent in Estonia, with the UK's 19.5 per cent the eighth biggest in the 27 member states. Ireland’s pay gap is at 13.9 per cent and the lowest is Slovenia’s 0.9 per cent. 'European Equal Pay Day reminds us of the unequal pay conditions women still face in the labour market ,'said EU Justice and Fundamental Rights Commissioner Viviane Reding. 'While the pay gap has declined in the recent years, there’s no reason to celebrate. The pay gap is still very large and much of the change actually resulted from a decline in men’s earnings rather than an increase for women.' She added: 'The principle of equal pay for equal work is written in the EU Treaties since 1957. It is high time that it is put in practice everywhere.' Estonia 27.7 . Austria 24 . Germany 22.3 . Greece 22.0 (2008) Czech Rep 21.6 . Finland 20.3 . Slovakia 19.6 . UK 19.5 . Netherlands 17.8 . Hungary 17.6 . Cyprus 16.8 . Spain 16.2 . Denmark 16.0 . France 15.6 . Latvia 15.5 . Sweden 15.4 . Lithuania 14.6 . Ireland 13.9 . Malta 13.4 . Bulgaria 13 . Portugal 12.8 . Belgium 10.2 . Romania 8.8 . Luxembourg 8.7 . Italy 5.3 . Poland 4.5Slovenia 0.9 . The commission says the gradual reduction in the pay gap is not necessarily thanks to improving pay and working conditions for women. It may reflect the economic downturn’s impact primarily on male-dominated sectors such as construction and engineering. The issue will be discussed next month at a gathering of more than 150 companies in Brussels to exchange equal pay 'best practice'. A commission report on tightening EU equal pay rules and on how companies should conduct 'gender-neutral job evaluation and job classification systems' is due to be published in the summer. Brussels also wants EU governments to organise their own 'national equal pay days' to put the spotlight on the need for pay parity between the sexes. But while UK women may be paid almost a fifth less compared to their male colelagues, they have more in the bank, . Despite being paid less than men, women savers have about £500 more in the bank than their male counterparts, according to the Halifax. In terms of share of wages, the gap is still more striking: women have 41 per cent of their annual salary in savings, while men have just 23 per cent. The bank says the average man among its account holders has saved up £7,699 – against £8,211, or £512 more, for women. The finding holds true in all regions across England and Wales. The Trades Union Congress analysis, which is based on figures from the Office for National Statistics, says the pay gap also translates into smaller pensions. It found that women aged from 50 to 59 endure the widest gender pay gap of any age group. In their 20s, women typically earn more than men and in their 30s they fall only slightly behind. But the gap grows rapidly in their 40s and reaches a peak in their 50s.","The biggest gender pay gap is nearly 28 per cent in Estonia .

Games can then be played using an Atlas control pad, which looks similar to the Xbox controller, and up to four pads can be connected via Bluetooth. As part of the deal, Google has bought the app and controller parts of the business, and hired Green Throttle's founders Huang, Matt Crowley and Karl Townsend. The Arena app was removed last year unexpectedly. Green Throttle said at the time: ‘Beginning November 8th, 2013, our Arena app will no longer be available on Google Play or the Amazon Appstore for Android and all backend support for the app will cease.

"You're probably feeling pretty smug as you suck down on your cucumber and amaranth smoothie while reading this, mid-way through your carb-free January juice fast. But be warned: one in six New Year dieters will actually gain weight this month. And if it's not a basic lack of human willpower that trips you up and elbows you face-first into the biscuit tin, it'll either be the fact that January is too boring to focus on a diet, or the reality that you're hungry and constantly thinking about food. You're probably feeling pretty smug as you suck down on your cucumber and amaranth smoothie while reading this, mid-way through your carb-free January juice fast, but one in six New Year dieters will actually gain weight . Many people looking to . cut back on food intake and lose their Christmas bulge find . themselves struggling to such an extent that 17 per cent of dieters actually gain weight in January. Some 31 per cent of people polled as part of a survey by Voucher Cloud admitted dieting in January, while 28 per cent say they cut down on food and 41 per cent change nothing about their eating habits. Of the 1,915 British men and women surveyed, 62 per cent said they had previously dieted in January, with 54 per cent saying their New Year weight-loss plan had been a success. But 29 per cent said they remained the same weight, and 17 per cent - one in six - actually gained weight in the first month of the year. Respondents . who had gained weight were asked why they felt this happened, to which . just over a quarter, 27 per cent, said that trying to avoid food . actually made them feel hungrier as they 'thought about it all the . time'. January is considered too boring a month in which to diet, which leads to people failing . Some 25 per cent found themselves 'comfort eating to avoid the January . blues', while 22 per cent said that January was 'too boring' so they . 'lacked the motivation' to stick to a diet plan. The biggest response, . however, was simply down to a 'lack of willpower', with 48 per cent . admitting to having just given up. Those . who lost weight were asked to state in pounds the amount of weight that . they'd lost following their January diet, which revealed the average . figure to be 6.1lb across all dieters. Those who said they had . gained weight during this period in the past were also asked how much . they had put on, which revealed the average to be 2.4lb. When . successful January dieters were asked if they believed they had . achieved their target weight loss in the past, only 32 per cent of . dieters said yes. But 44 per cent said that they would have preferred to have lost more, while 24 per cent said that they were far off what they would like to have lost.

Around 33 per . cent said it was to improve general health, while 11 per cent said . it was down to 'pressure from their partner'. The . financial side of dieting was also explored by the study, as all . respondents who had attempted a January diet in the past were asked if they had ever paid money to sign up to specific diets. To this, 43 per . cent of dieters said they had, but only 48 per cent of these believed their money had been well-spent.

When the bells are ringing out for New Year's Day it's easy to think that it will be a breeze to lose the spare tyre gained over Christmas. However, this often isn't the case! 'Many of us have a clear social calendar during this period, which might make it appear easier to cut down on unnecessary calories. 'Yet one of the biggest causes of over eating is simple boredom and it seems that there's plenty of that in January. It's far too easy to help yourself to junk food out of the cupboard when having a quiet Saturday night in!

"The FireChat app, pictured, uses Apple's iOS 7 Multipeer Connectivity Framework to turn create a network of phone users without using mobile signal . Buried within the settings of Apple’s iOS 7 is a feature that could revolutionise how we communicate. Called the Multipeer Connectivity Framework (MCF), it lets you send messages and photos even when a person has no signal. Now a group of developers has created a free iPhone app called FireChat that takes advantage of this feature - and it even works over long distances. The FireChat app was developed by the crowdsourced firm Open Garden. When a user opens the app, they can pick a screen name to start sending messages. Within the app there are 'chatrooms' with 'Everyone' and 'Nearby' options. The former will search for all users, while the latter option applies to people within Bluetooth and Wi-Fi range who are also using the app. This is particularly useful when on a plane, or the underground. It can also be used to save money on data plans, for example. Apple added MCF to its iOS 7 software last year. It creates what is called a wireless mesh network that connects phones to each other. In 'Nearby' mode, instead . of sending messages using a mobile or data signal, the feature lets . users send messages to people in close proximity that are in Bluetooth . or Wi-Fi Direct range - up to around 30 feet (9 metres). It does this by creating a localised network in which each phone becomes a node, and the data is passed between nodes. Apple . uses the framework for its AirDrop feature, for example, which makes it . easy to send files and data to other connected iPhone users. The FireChat app, pictured left, was developed by Open Garden. In the app there are 'chatrooms' including Everyone and Nearby.

These messages are sent securely, so the individual nodes can’t read them. Users can also send messages anonymously to avoid snooping, for example, because data is sent from app usernames, as opposed to mobile numbers. Elsewhere, because the feature doesn’t use an internet connection, it can’t be infiltrated by hackers. The 'Everyone' Setting allows people to send information further however. It does this by bringing all its nodes . onto one network and relaying messages from one node to another until . it reaches the final recipient. It is not known whether there is a . maximum distance the app will work within, and in theory it will work wherever there are nodes, but MailOnline has . contacted the company to find out more. The distance a message can be sent is probably dependent on whether a given region has the nodes needed to relay the messages. Nodes . are simply a vehicle for passing data along a network. On a traditional . internet network any device that’s connected to the network is also . called a node. For example, if a network has a phone, tablet, two computers and a printer connected to it there are five nodes on the network. Each . of these devices have a network address which is used to uniquely . identify each one. This helps keep track of where data is being . transferred to and from on the network. There is an Android version of the mesh networking feature, developed by Open Garden, but it is not a chat app and is instead used for file sharing.","The iOS 7 feature is called Multipeer Connectivity Framework (MCF)

"Get a whiff of this: a French research, art and design centre have created a gizmo, similar to a mobile phone, that enables the user to send up to 320 different smells to other devices of its kind. La Laborotoire's cylindrical oPhone, invented by David Edwards and Harvard students Rachel Field and Amy Yin in the Paris laboratories, uses a tiny chip, the oChip, to produce scent signals using olfactive information, which are then sent out and received by connecting an app - OTracks - to Bluetooth. And Edwards says the chips will soon be able to send thousands of different smells. La Laboratoire's oPhone is a cyclinder packed with a tiny chip capable of producing scent signals . The team have been prototyping the oPhone for one year, and recently unveiled the latest version at the Wired UK conference, as reported in Wired. The product will be out later this year and will come with two oPhones, to enable people to smell more than one smell at the same time. It is ultimately aimed at creating mulch-sensory media experiences. According to Wired, Edwards is working with Paris Vapors to use the product in books, movies and television shows. The oPhone product will be sold in pairs to enable users to experience multiple smells simultaneously .

"There were tears of joy at JFK Airport today as a Holocaust survivor was reunited with the friend who smuggled food to her as she hid from the Nazis. Mira Wexler, 78, hid on 85-year-old Helena Weglowski’s farm during the Second World War and they haven’t seen each other since 1945, when it ended. Helena, from Ilawa, Poland, hugged and kissed Wexler and described the feeling of seeing her friend again as overwhelming. Together again: There were tears of joy at JFK Airport today as a Holocaust survivor was reunited with the friend who smuggled food to her as she hid from the Nazis . Survival strategy: Mira Wexler (right) hid on the farm of Helena Weglowski (left) during the Second World War and they haven’t seen each other since 1945, when it ended . Tender moment: Helena, from Ilawa, Poland, hugged and kissed Mira and described the feeling of seeing her friend again as overwhelming . Emotional: Mira, who now lives in Rio de Janeiro, said 'it was very touching for me to be here' She told the New York Post: ‘I’m extremely happy to see Mira again. I remember the time before the war when we would play together. The war destroyed everything — but now we can be together again and I’m extremely overwhelmed.’ Mira, who lives in Rio de Janeiro, told the paper: ‘It was very touching for me to be here and see Helena again. It’s something I couldn’t imagine until now — and it’s happening.’ The story of their friendship begins in 1942, when German soldiers forced Wexler and her family from their Polish village to a ghetto in Ludwipol, now part of Ukraine. Helena, pictured here as a young woman in 1955, said she was overwhelmed to see her friend again . Close bond: Helena (right), with her brother Stanislaw (centre) in 1949 . The Germans began liquidating the ghetto in 1942 so Mira’s family - her father, Jacob, having been killed - fled to Weglowski’s farm in Stara Huta. Jacob owned a mill on the Weglowski farm and the two families were on friendly terms. Helena and her brother, Stanislaw, spent two years ferrying food to Mira and her mother, Chana as they hid in the grounds. Mira today acknowledged that Helena risked her life because she would have been killed if the Germans found out she was harbouring Jews. The reunion was organised by The Jewish Foundation For The Righteous, whose Executive Vice President, Stanlee Stahl, remarked: ‘In the many years we have worked with survivors and their rescuers, I continue to be amazed by the heroism of the thousands of Christian rescuers who risked their lives to save Jews from certain death. 'We owe a great deal of gratitude to these Righteous Gentiles, and through our work, hope to improve their lives and preserve their stories of heroism.' Miraculously, Chana and Mira survived and moved to Brazil when Germany was defeated.","Mira Wexler hid on Helena Weglowski’s farm during the Second World War .

"Condemned: Joseph Wood's execution by lethal injection was halted after a court ruled this week he had a right to know the drugs that will be used to end his life . A U.S. appeals court has ordered the execution of an Arizona man condemned for killing his ex-girlfriend and her father in to be put on hold until the state discloses which lethal injection drugs it will use. Joseph Wood, 55, was scheduled to be put to death Wednesday, but the court ruled he was entitled to know more about the drugs that will be used to execute him and who will be administering them. The three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling effectively postponed Wood's death for the foreseeable future as the state scrambles to find an acceptable lethal injection method amid drug shortages and controversies around the U.S. Wood raised serious questions about whether his constitutional rights were being violated, and it said the inmate could suffer 'irreparable harm' if his demands were not met, the court ruled in a 2-1 decision. 'Since Wood's execution would likely not be delayed much, if at all, by giving him the information he seeks, the public interest factor weighs in Wood's favor,' said Judge Sidney Thomas, writing for the majority. Wood's attorney, Dale Baich, said in a statement that the decision underlined the public's right to know in the debate over capital punishment in Arizona and beyond. Chamber of death: An unidentified Arizona Corrections Officer adjusts the straps on the gurney used for lethal injections at the Florence Death House at the Arizona State Prison . 'The court said it's important that . specific and detailed information be provided so the public can know . about how safely and reliably the death penalty is administered,' Baich . explained. A spokeswoman for Arizona's attorney general said the state would ask the full appeals court to reconsider. Wood was convicted in 1991 of walking into an automobile body shop in Tucson and shooting his former girlfriend, Debbie Dietz, 29, to death after fatally shooting her father, Gene Dietz, 55. Saturday's ruling, which reverses a lower-court decision, requires the state to provide death row inmates with information on the drugs that will be used to kill them, as well as details about the medical personnel who will be involved. Wood is one of six death row inmates who sued Arizona last month arguing that secrecy surrounding lethal-injection drugs used in botched executions in Ohio and Oklahoma violates their constitutional rights. The most infamous incident happened in April, when a faulty drug combination caused Oklahoma inmate Clayton Lockett, 38, died of a heart attack 40 minutes after a botched injection.","Joseph Wood was convicted in 1991 of murdering both his ex-girlfriend and her father .

"A 17-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of committing two rapes at a £32,000-a-year boarding school, it was revealed tonight. The teenager was detained and has since been released on bail following the allegations at the private Repton School in Derbyshire, which was attended by Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson. The school, which also includes author Roald Dahl and actor Tom Chambers among its alumni, caters for male and female boarding and day pupils aged 13 to 18 and dates back to 1559. Probe: The teenager was detained after the allegations at the private Repton School (above) in Derbyshire . A Derbyshire Police spokesman said: ‘Officers investigating allegations of sexual offences at Repton School have arrested a 17-year-old youth. ‘The youth was arrested by officers on Tuesday on suspicion of committing two rapes. He was questioned and released on police bail while enquiries continue.’ The allegations date back to October 4. Headmaster Robert Holroyd said: ‘I can confirm that a police investigation is currently being conducted into an alleged sexual offence at Repton School. Top Gear presenter: Jeremy Clarkson (pictured) achieved nine O-levels as a boarder at Repton in the 1970s . Days gone by: Repton School pictured in the 1930s. Fees are now £10,547 per term for boarding students . ‘The welfare of the pupils in our care is our overriding priority, and we are giving the police all the assistance we can in this matter.' He added: ‘The investigation does not involve any member of staff, past or present. As you will appreciate, given the police investigation, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage.’ Clarkson achieved nine O-levels as a Repton boarder in the 1970s, but claimed in an autobiography to have been expelled before taking his A-levels for ‘drinking, smoking and making a general nuisance’ of himself. Repton charges £10,547 per term (£31,641 per year) for boarding students, and £7,825 per term (£23,475 per year) for day students. It currently has 665 pupils - 364 boys and 301 girls.

"Something ELSE to worry about?! Ear lobe surgery is on the rise (seriously) First there were cankles. Then there was back fat. Last week we were told about swoobs, mere moments after we'd come to terms with our big fat thutts. But it seems the beauty industry hasn't yet run out of body parts they want to make us hate, then yearn to rip up and rebuild, stuffed full of collagen and Botox. Well, not quite yet. And the object of their contempt now? Our poor little earlobes. Yes, try as they might to hide way up high behind hair and earrings, even these adorably plump dinky danglers are not safe from the surgeon's knife. While most of us probably hadn't noticed our ears dangling lower than usual (or ever considered it much of a problem), cosmetic clinics are adamant that as we age our earlobes can begin to sag and grow longer, developing wrinkles and creases. And luckily for us girls, experts say this condition is generally only present in females, and is often made worse by the use of earrings over the years. However, with ear accessories such as the use of stretching tapers growing ever more popular with men, there is an increasing number of cases of male earlobe droop. One clinic is even offering . an earlobe rejuvenation treatment, claiming that with the application . of dermal fillers such as Juvederm and Restylane you can now . 'revolumise and restore your earlobes to give them a more youthful . looking appearance'. Experts use a hyaluronic filler, . such as Juvaderm, Emervel or Restylane, to create this tissue-expanding . earlobe effect. And while Botox notoriously wears off after about four months, the clinic claims that the use of dermal filler in the earlobe tightens the lobe for far longer than when used in other areas, mainly due to the lack of wear and tear or any muscle movement in the area being treated. Regency Aesthetics in London offer the £195 treatment, and describe it as the ideal 'lunch-time earlobe lift' - and proclaim you can, thank goodness, even wear your earrings . immediately after treatment with no swelling or bruising. Speaking . about the new treatment, Dr Rikin said: 'Women come to us to subtly . enhance their look and opting for treatments such as Earlobe Rejuvenation . enables them to give the appearance of true youth in the places that . matter.' Time to ditch the bling? Experts say this condition is generally only present in females and is often made worse by the use of earrings over the years, especially big, heavy ones favoured by the likes of Kim Kardashian . Body image and wellbeing expert Katie Lowe of Fat Girl PhD said: 'I'd love to think that this is some kind of practical joke thrown out by the beauty industry, but it's nowhere near April Fool's Day yet - so I can only assume this is real. 'It's comical, really - unless anyone actually falls for it. Every time these cynical surgical types - who are quite clearly looking to make a quick buck out of people's insecurities - publicise a treatment like this, they're just perpetuating a ""perfection at all costs"" myth, and making people think negatively about a part of their body that nobody should ever, ever worry about. 'When I'm trying to work out how to show my true youth in a place that matters, I can safely say my earlobes are (and should be) categorically the bottom of the list. 'It's absolutely ridiculous, and I hope people see it that way - and spend their lunch times having a bite to eat, rather than an over-priced, ridiculous beauty treatment!'. How bizarre:  While it's most common among women, trends such as stretching tapers, left, have made earlobe droop more common in men.  In some countries like Malayasia, elongated earlobes are revered .","Earlobe sagging is most common in women, particularly who wear earrings .

"Thousands of people lined the streets of York to welcome troops home from Afghanistan in a 'humbling' display, days after soldier Lee Rigby was murdered in the street in Woolwich. The death of Drummer Rigby, 25, who was hacked to death by alleged Islamist extremists on Wednesday, left the nation appalled, and the community in York appeared determined to show its support for the armed forces as 2 Signal Regiment marched through the city yesterday. The regiment's commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Colin Vaudin said the massive turnout at the parade was 'testament to the character of the British people'. Defiant display: Hundreds of soldiers from 2 Signal Regiment marched through the city of York in a 'show of solidarity and strength against abhorrent acts' 'Humbled': The regiment's commanding officer said the huge turn-out in York was 'testament to the character of the British people' Support: Thousands of people - including many dressed in Help for Heroes clothing - cheered on the soldiers as they paraded through the city streets, two days after Drummer Lee Rigby was murdered in the street in Woolwich . Drummer Rigby, from Halifax in Yorkshire, was walking to his London barracks wearing a Help for Heroes top when he was set upon and butchered by extremists wielding cleavers and knives. Many members of the crowd were wearing tops and hats emblazoned with the name of the military charity, which has seen donations rocket in the days after the 25-year-old soldier's shocking death. An order banning military personnel from wearing their uniforms in public was issued in the wake of the attack, but was quickly scrapped by Prime Minister David Cameron, who told Defence Secretary Philip Hammond he was 'seriously dismayed' by the official guidance. The order had prompted defiant soldiers to post pictures of themselves in full military dress on line, and Mr Cameron insisted 'brave' service personnel must 'go about their lives as normal'. The fury sparked by the short-lived ban made the sight of more than 300 uniformed soldiers marching in unison through York yesterday especially resonant. Welcome back: More than 300 soldiers from 2 Signal Regiment, which returned from a six month tour of Afghanistan last week, marched through York yesterday . Reunited: Lieutenant Colonel Colin Vaudin, commander of 2 Signal Regiment, was treated to a warm hug from his nine-year-old daughter Katharine in York yesterday . Proud: Lieutenant Colonel Vaudin embraces his son Nicholas, left, while another member of 2 Signal Regiment holds a baby, right, at the parade in York city centre . Warm reception: The show of support for the military in York came two days after 25-year-old Drummer Lee Rigby was killed in the street in Woolwich . Lt Col Vaudin said the cheers from the crowd yesterday were evidence of the huge support for the armed forces among the public. 'I think the crowd have been superb,' he said yesterday. 'They've been very, . very large, very supportive and hearing their claps and shouts of . support means so much to myself and the soldiers of my regiment. 'Clearly the shocking attack on Drummer Rigby has affected us all and . our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends. 'The public support that was on display in the city of York is . testament to the character of the British People and the warmth and . respect they have for the armed forces. 'Throughout my service the people of the UK - the vast majority - are . hugely supportive of the armed forces and everything we do, and I think . that's what we've seen.' Respect: The soldiers said the support from the crowd yesterday was evidence of the public's 'warmth and respect' for the armed forces . 'Great job': More than 300 soldiers in full uniform marched through the city, left, while well-wishers including a young boy, right, cheered and waved Union flags . His wife, Jenny Vaudin, was one of the many who lined the route to . welcome family and friends home from the six-month tour, which the . regiment returned from last week. 'We came out to see the guys home, because they've done a great job and we're really proud of them,' she said. Mrs Vaudin said the Woolwich attack had strengthened public support for troops. 'It's really hard to put into words that it's happening here,' she said. 'The good part of it is people are joining together in a show of . solidarity and strength against acts like this, which are absolutely . abhorrent.' Solidarity: Troops are seen standing to attention in front of York Minster yesterday, as the regiment's return from Afghanistan was celebrated with a welcome parade . Parade: Soldiers from the regiment have spent months working in Helmand Province and Kabul, providing force protection as well as IT and telecommunications services . More than 300 soldiers took part in the parade from York Minster, accompanied by the Royal Corps of Signals Band. The Lord Mayor of York, Councillor Julie Gunnell and Brigadier Greville . Bibby CBE, Commander of 15 North East, Brigade saluted lines of troops . as they marched past Mansion House. Prayers: The murder of Drummer Lee Rigby, 25, on Wednesday left the nation stunned . The soldiers have been working at several locations within Helmand . Province and Kabul providing force protection as well as . telecommunications and IT services. Watching the parade was Steven Beckett, a mechanic who turned out to show his gratitude. 'With the events of recent days, we need to show that as a nation we . support our troops and stand by them when something so tragic happens,' he said. Marie Hunt, a nurse who waved a Union flag as soldiers paraded past, . said: 'This is an important day for the lads and lasses who've been in . Afghanistan. 'To come home to news of the attack on the soldier must be absolutely horrible.' North Yorkshire Police said no extra officers were deployed for the event but officers had been told to 'remain vigilant' as the parade took place. Elsewhere yesterday the town of Poulton-le-Fylde in Lancashire was brought to a standstill as hundreds lined the streets as a mark of respect for a young soldier killed in Afghanistan. Shops closed their doors as the hearse carrying Fusilier Samuel Flint's coffin approached St Chad's Church in the town centre, with many onlookers stepping forward to throw flowers onto the vehicle. By the time the cortege reached the gates of the church it was covered in blooms. The 21-year-old soldier died when the . Mastiff armoured vehicle he was travelling in hit an IED while on . patrol in Helmand province on April 30. He was killed along with Corporal . William Savage, 30, who served with him in the 2nd Battalion The Royal . Regiment of Scotland, and Private Robert Hetherington, 25, who served . with the 7th Battalion of the Regiment. The . hundreds who had gathered in the square outside the church stood in . silence as the pallbearers made their way through the graveyard to the . sound of a lone piper. Fusilier Flint's coffin was carried into the service with full military honours yesterday, as his family walked behind. The Ministry of Defence said all . three men were part of a patrol travelling along Route 611 between . Forward Operating Base Ouellette and Patrol Base Lashkar Gah Durai in . Nahr-e-Saraj when their vehicle was hit by the IED blast. Avid Manchester City fan Fusilier Flint joined the Army in November 2011 and was deployed to Afghanistan in March. The . crowd broke into spontaneous applause when Fusilier Flint's coffin was . carried out of the church following the hour-long service. Mark of respect: Hundreds of people lined the streets of Poulten-Le-Fylde to mark the funeral of Fusilier Samuel Flint, 21, yesterday, with many throwing flowers onto the hearse as it passed en route to St Chad's Church . Grief: Relatives and friends of the young soldier, who was killed by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan on April 30, walked behind the hearse before his coffin was carried into the church with full military honours . Heartbreak: Fusilier Samuel Flint was killed along with Corporal William Savage, 30, and Private Robert Hetherington, 25, when the armoured vehicle they were travelling in drove over an IED . Many of those packed outside were in tears as the congregation left to Swedish House Mafia's Don't You Worry Child. Earlier, . the crowd listened in silence to the service, which included eulogies . from Fusilier Flint's friend Fusilier Jeffrey Batista and some of his . six brothers and sisters. Emotion: A soldier looks on as the hearse carrying the coffin of Fusilier Samuel Flint made its way through Poulton-Le-Fylde in Lancashire yesterday . Service: Apparently overcome, the soldier was comforted by a colleague outside the service in St Chad's Church in Fusilier Flint's home town .","More than 300 soldiers from the 2 Signal Regiment were cheered as they marched through York city centre .

"Wasila Tasi'u, 14, is on trial for allegedly murdering her husband, 35, with poison . A 14-year-old Nigerian child bride is facing the death penalty for allegedly murdering her 35-year-old husband with rat poison. Prosecutors allege that Wasila Tasi'u, who comes from a poor, rural family in the north of the country, laced her husband Umar Sani's food with poison - perhaps because she regretted the marriage in April. She is also accused of the murder of three other people, who are said to have died suddenly after eating the same meal prepared for a post-wedding celebration in the village of Unguwar Yansoro. But the trial has angered activists who claim a girl who married a man more than 20 years her senior should be treated as a victim. The case was opened yesterday with testimony from a seven-year-old child who says she was given money and sent to buy the poison on the same day Sani died. Prosecutor Lamido Abba Soron-Dinki's first witness was a girl identified as Hamziyya, who was living in the same house as Tasi'u and her husband at the time. Hamziyya was identified as the sister of Sani's 'co-wife', referring to a woman the deceased farmer had married previously in a region where polygamy is widespread. She testified that Tasi'u gave her 80 naira ($0.45, 0.36 euros) to buy rat poison from a local shop on April 5. 'She said rats were disturbing her in her room,' Hamziyya told the court. Wasila speaks with an unidentified defence counsel outside the courtroom during a break at her trial at Kano State High Court in the village of Gezawa . Wasila's parents stand outside the courtroom  shortly after the first day of their daughter's trial . Father Tasiu Muhammad sits outside his house at Kaurar Naduni village, 62 kilometres outside the northern Nigerian city of Kano . Shopkeeper Abuwa Yusuf from the town of Unguwar Yansoro supported the story and confirmed selling the poison to the girl. And neighbour Abdulrahim Ibrahim told the court that he was also offered the food allegedly prepared by Tasi'u - and saw Sani looking 'visibly ill' after eating. He said: 'When he brought the food I noticed some sandy-like particles, black in colour. He ate four of the small balls made of bean paste but 'was not comfortable with the taste', adding: 'It was only Umar (Sani) who continued eating.' Sani Garba, 55, holds the picture of his 14-year-old daughter-in-law Wasila Tasi'u inside her abandoned matrimonial home in the village of Unguwar Yansoro, in northern Nigerian . Mr Garba, 55, stands in the abandoned bedroom of his 14-year-old daughter-in-law Wasila . He added that he took Sani home and learnt that three others who ate the food had died suddenly. Prosecutors allege that Tasiu's poison food killed four people and have joined all the reported deaths into one murder charge. Judge Mohammed Yahaya, sitting at the Gezawa High Court, has entered a plea of not guilty for Tasi'u, who refused to respond at a previous hearing on October 30 when the charges were put to her. The judge has rejected defence applications for the case to be transferred to a juvenile court. The last time Nigeria sentenced a juvenile to death was in 1997, according to Human Rights Watch. The case continues.

"A decorated New York City police officer has been charged with assault and burglary for breaking into a random woman's apartment and beating her up after he went out drinking to celebrate receiving a police honor this past June. On Monday, Officer Eugene Donnelly of the Bronx was charged with misdemeanor assault and burglary for the June 11 incident. The 27-year-old has also been suspended from duty without pay pending the investigation and legal case. Scroll down for video . CHarged: NYPD Officer Eugene Donnelly has been charged with assault and burglary for a drunken incident that happened just a few hours after he received the department's second-highest honor last June. Pictured right after receiving the Police Combat Cross . Donnelly, a four-year veteran of the force, reveied the Police Combat Cross - the department's second-highest honor - on June 10 for his bravery arresting a gunman who shot at him in May 2012. The 27-year-old was even pictured shaking Mayor Bill De Blasio's hand at the ceremony held at One Police Plaza. Following the event, Donnelly went out drinking to celebrate and decided to sleep over at a friend's house in Woodlawn. It the early hours of June 11, Donnelly was so drunk he . wandered out of his friend's apartment wearing only his underwear. He then reentered the building and broke down the door of another apartment, thinking it was his friend's, the New York Daily News reported. The unidentified 30-year-old woman woke up from the noise, and claims he proceeded to punch her more than 20 times and she tried to flee. Donnelly eventually left and sources told the Daily News that he took a swig of milk from the woman's refrigerator before stepping out. He was later captured on surveillance footage, and police used the images for wanted pictures before realizing the suspect was one of their own. Mr Mayor: Officer Donnelly shook Mayor Bill De Blasio's hand at the ceremony, and then proceeded to beat up a random woman in a drunken stupor hours later . Placed on unpaid leave: Donnelly allegedly broke into a woman's apartment, thinking it was his friend's, and proceeded to punch the woman 20 times before stealing milk from her refrigerator while leaving . Donnelly was awarded the medal just over two years after he arrested a teen gunman terrorizing a Bronx neighborhood in May 2012. He was off-duty while driving with a friend to meet his partner when several men ran from a park while being chased by a gun-wielding Javon Julien. Julien, 19, fired a shot at the men while running past Donnelly’s car. The cop shouted at Julien to stop, but the teen instead shot out Donnelly’s driver’s side mirror. The officer fired back, striking Julien four times before chasing down and arresting him. Julien was given eight years in prison for his shooting spree. The Bronx DA is still deciding whether to file charges against Donnelly.","Eugene Donnelly received the Police Combat Cross on June 10, 2013 for heroic actions in a 2012 shootout with a Bronx teen .

"Big businesses are to be offered money to turn off their power to stop Britain suffering from a winter of electricity power cuts. Ahead of unveiling a raft of new measures designed to keep the lights, Energy Secretary Ed Davey insisted: 'There will be no blackouts. Period.' It follows warnings that the number of power cuts has soared in recent years, amid fears that Seventies-style rationing will be needed to ensure supplies can be maintained. Energy Secretary Ed Davey insisted the government had plans to keep the lights on this winter . The government is expected to announce new contingency measures this week to ensure supplies are secure, and options for reducing demand if it is needed. It follows concerns about energy security after a fire forced the closure of Didcot B, a gas-fired station in Oxfordshire which produces enough electricity to meet the needs of one million households. It was reduced to half capacity after a blaze broke out in one of the two cooling tower modules at the site. The Didcot incident is the latest blaze to hit Britain's power capacity, with Ironbridge and Ferrybridge crippled by fires earlier this year. Energy supply has also been hit by plans to close a site at Barking in east London. Figures from energy regulator show there were 17,657 blackouts affecting 3.5million people in 2013-14, compared with 1,600 cuts affecting 180,900 in 2010-11. Under the governments plans, mothballed power plants could be brought back into use to bolster power supplies. But factories and heavy industry could be asked to reduce or halt production, or switch to their own generators, to ensure homes are unaffected by power shortages. Mr Davey told the Sunday Telegraph: 'There will be no blackouts. Period. 'We have extra contingencies on top of the caution, and extra contingencies on top of the contingencies. 'They (companies) volunteer to get payments - if the National Grid say, 'we want you to come off the national grid for a few hours and generate your own power', you will get paid for that. 'That is cheaper for the consumer than building an extra power plant. Cheaper, quicker and industry likes it.' A major fire broke out this week at Didcot B, a gas-fired station in Oxfordshire which produces enough electricity to meet the needs of one million households . The blazein one of the two cooling tower modules meant the plant is reduced to half capacity . Mr Davey added: 'Some companies would change their behaviour, voluntarily, and be recompensed for it. Turning down their refrigerators by a degree, or changing a shift pattern for a week so staff come in earlier... The idea is to move factory production away from peak demand periods.' Four UK nuclear power reactors which have been shut down after a defect was discovered at one of them will only be operating at three-quarters capacity when they return to service by the end of this year. The UK is facing an energy crunch over the next two winters when the capacity margin - how much its total generating capacity outstrips expected peak demand - is expected to shrink to as little as 2 per cent. Mr Davey added that while the public should be energy efficient, turning off unused appliances and lights where they can, the Government was not making a formal request.","Government to set out plans to keep the lights on in the coming months .

"Police in North Carolina confirmed at a press conference on Monday that murdered school counselor Maggie Daniels was strangled inside her own apartment in June. The new details were released on the same day that suspect Sharman Odom made his first appearance in court for his arraignment in a Newton court and was pictured smirking again as he was reminded of the charges his faces. Odom, 34, is starring at the death penalty for the murder of Daniels, 31 and when his mother Darlene Odom left court on Monday morning she was videoed flailing her arms at photographers and Newton police confirmed she will face three assault charges as a result of her actions. Grinning: . Local camera crews caught Sharman Odom grinning as he was cuffed and . led away on Sunday. Police say he  murdered his neighbor Maggie Daniels by strangulation . Tragedy: Sharman Odom (right) is the only suspect in the murder of Maggie Davis (left) Investigators said that Maggie Daniels was asphyxiated inside her apartment on June 28 after a struggle. 'She died of strangulation,' said Newton Police Chief Donald Brown according to WBTV. 'There was a struggle.' Newton police said that upon obtaining a search warrant last week, they discovered physical evidence, including a patch of missing hair near Odom's scalp that led to them charging the man on Saturday. The hair was later found by authorities in Odom's closet, according to the warrant. Push: Sharman Odom¿s mother, Darlene, tried to knock cameras out of photographers hands outside court on MOnday and will face three assault charges . During the search of Odom's house on July 26 police also recovered cell phones that revealed selfies of the suspect with scratches on his face. Investigators did say that tests have not been able to determine whether Daniels had been physically assaulted and still authorities have yet to find any evidence of a link between Odom and the Newton High School counselor. Odom's current attorney told NBC Charlotte's Rad Berky that he is 'fearful' and is 'concerned about some things' - although he could not explain why his client smiled again during his court appearance. Odom, 34, is the only suspect in the murder of 31-year-old Maggie Daniels, who was found dead June 28 in her Newton, North Carolina apartment, officials said. Odom was Daniels’ neighbor in the apartment complex, cops told WSOC, and he has a violent past that includes accusations of rape and assault. Daniels’ lifeless body was discovered on her bedroom floor by a neighbor who went inside after finding the door to the woman’s apartment open, according to WSOC. There was no sign of forced entry. Always smiling: Neighbors say the slain woman was always happy, full of life . Living in fear: The well-liked Davis (right) was told shortly before her murder to start looking into self defense . On Saturday, Odom grinned as police led him away in handcuffs after he was arrested. ‘Why do you have a grin on your face,’ a reporter reporter could be heard asking Odom on the video. The accused killer did not reply. Daniels was also previously warned by a friend to take self-defense classes ‘and to give serious consideration to other measures to protect’ herself, WSOC reported. ‘It’s absolutely shocking,’ a neighbor told the station.‘I talked to him a little bit,’ Ryan Cline, whose mother lived next door to Odom, told the station. ‘He was really quiet and observant.’ Court documents revealed Odom was previously arrested on charges of second-degree rape and assault by strangulation. Those charges were subsequently dropped. ‘She seemed really friendly,’ said another neighbor. ‘She was always smiling.’","Suspect Sharman Odom, 34, appeared in court in Newton, North Carolina, for his arraignment .

"Friends looked with envy at the string of ‘wish you were here’ cards sent by Ashley Beaumont and his girlfriend from exotic locations around the world. But the couple’s travelling days are over after it was discovered that Beaumont was funding their lavish lifestyle by dealing cocaine – which made him an astonishing £84,000 a month, or £1million a year. Their secret was only found out when travel agents became suspicious that Beaumont, who is also a cage fighter, paid for their expensive trips in cash. Ashley Beaumont, 25, who was exposed as a cocaine dealer, after he and his fiancee Chelsea Barnes, 22 paid for their lavish holidays in cash . The couple spent almost £15,000 earned from drug dealing on a string of sunshine breaks around the Mediterranean and Caribbean . The former cage fighter was yesterday jailed for more than 10 years while his fiancee, who met him while working as a ring-girl, was given a 12-month suspended sentence for money laundering . The 25-year-old and five of his drug-dealing gang’s members have now been sentenced to a total of 46 years behind bars. Beaumont had recruited old school friends to flood South Wales with cocaine, Cardiff Crown Court heard. Documents found at Beaumont’s home showed that the gang, which had dealt the Class A drug for four and a half years before it was uncovered by a police investigation, had at least 50 regular buyers in the area, prosecutor Ieuan Bennett said. And Beaumont’s drugs empire made more than £20,000 a week, which he used to fund the holidays, as well as flash cars and designer clothes. Beaumont's second in command Marcus Purchase, 25, of Pontypool, (left) was given seven years and four months. And Dean McCann, 24, (right) of Newport, was given 10 years for the cocaine conspiracy, possessing mephedrone and for a burglary . Thomas Filer (left), 23, of Abersychan, and Adam Barker (right), 24, of Pontypool, were given five years for lesser crimes . He also had a fearsome record as a fighter and once knocked out an opponent with a punch in just 18 seconds. Beaumont and his 22-year-old girlfriend Chelsea Barnes, a ‘ring girl’ whom he met when she was hired to parade around the cage between fights, enjoyed breaks around the Mediterranean and the Caribbean totalling £14,777. Christopher Evans, 31, of Henllys, was sentenced to seven years and six months . Ringleader Beaumont, from Pontypool in south-east Wales, was given the longest jail sentence of ten years and eight months. Judge Neil Bidder QC told him: ‘You were the organiser, made the greatest profit and continued over a period of time.’ Judge Bidder added yesterday: ‘Trafficking Class A drugs causes degradation, misery and often death. ‘It’s an evil trade in which easy profit can be made and drugs lie at the root of most crime in Wales. Deterrent sentences are necessary for those who involve themselves.’ Mother-of-one Barnes, also from Pontypool, admitted money-laundering and was given a 12-month suspended sentence. Five other members of the gang were given prison sentences after pleading guilty to conspiring to supply Class A drugs. Gwent Police welcomed the sentences at the end of what they said was a ‘long and protracted investigation’. A spokesman added: ‘Whole communities have been saved from suffering and the sentences should be a warning to others.’","Ashley Beaumont, 25, and girlfriend Chelsea Barnes, 22, spent almost £15,000 earned from drug dealing on a string of sunshine breaks .

"A Florida man faces the death penalty after being convicted of killing his girlfriend's baby in 2009 by throwing the three-month-old out of a moving car while speeding down a highway. Richard McTear, of Tampa, was found guilty Thursday of first-degree murder and other charges related to the death of Emanuel Murray Jr. Prosecutors argued during the trial he killed the baby to spite his mother. McTear is believed by authorities to have taken the child on a drive after an argument with Jasmine Bedwell, 22, and tossed him out of the moving car. Blood stains were later found on McTear and in the vehicle, cops said. Just before the trial: Richard McTear, center, stands during jury selection at the George E. Edgecomb Courthouse in Tampa, he was convicted Thursday of murder . Prosecutors claimed during the trial the killing was 'the ultimate act of revenge' against Bedwell, who had sidled up to a new man in the days before the killing, according to reports. The jury deliberated for about seven hours before handing down the guilty verdict in the murder charge and also on counts of kidnapping, battery and aggravated child abuse. A first-degree murder conviction in Florida brings a mandatory sentence of life in prison, but jurors could also recommend the death penalty. It is now known which way the jury is leaning. The guilty verdict came despite McTear's public defender arguing during the trial that there was no evidence definitively showing he had thrown the baby onto the road. 'There's no clear explanation of how that baby got to the side of that road,' Assistant Public Defender Mike Peacock said in his closing argument, according to the Tampa Bay Times. He made this statement despite the child's blood having been found on both McTear and on a car seat. Jurors cried when shown pictures of the dead child, the Times reported. McTear's previous trial was declared a mistrial after Bedwell insisted the then-17-year-old man threatened to kill her son. It was not the first time she made the accusation. Getting ready: McTear's attorney is shown putting a tie on the now-convicted killer during his trial . Bedwell's claim that her 25-year-old . ex-boyfriend threatened to shoot her and her son and urinate on the . child came up originally in a 2010 trial where McTear was found not . guilty of battering her. Prior . to the commencement of that previous trial, the court ruled the phone . call with the threat should not be introduced because it was part of a . previous trial - where McTear was ultimately acquitted for assault - and . was therefore irrelevant in the murder case. But Bedwell gasped out the allegation amid tears as soon as she took the stand during the eventual mistrial. The victim: Three-month-old Emanuel Murray died after being tossed from a moving car on a busy Florida highway . 'The . jurors heard testimony they should not have heard under any . circumstances. In this court's conclusion, a mistrial is necessary,' Fuente said on Tuesday morning. 'I'll say this: I do this with extreme . reluctance. I'm not suggesting that any counsel did anything . inappropriate.' Assistant State Attorney Ron Gale had asked Bedwell about phone calls from McTear the day before Emanuel's death. Bedwell replied saying McTear had called her and 'told me that he was going to come over and shoot my baby in the face and p*** on him, in his face, and he was going to kill both of us.' Gale acknowledged Bedwell's testimony was 'clearly... a violation' of the court order but he said he had not expected her to refer to the phone call, which took place about six weeks before her son's death. However, he added that he had not specifically told her not to mention in their preparations for testimony. 'It did not come up,' Gale said. McTear's lawyers argued that there is not enough evidence to show his client is responsible for the baby's death. Prosecutors claim McTear entered Bedwell's apartment by force in May, 2009 and beat her before . throwing the baby carrier against the wall while the child was inside . it, ABC Action News reported. He then allegedly drove off with the child and threw him out onto the motorway. Devastated mother: Jasmine Bedwell, pictured center in 2009, previously said she wants McTear to face the death penalty . An off-duty TV cameraman spotted the child's body lying by the side of the motorway in Tampa. Jason Bird said he thought it was a toy doll - until he saw the baby's eyes. A huge manhunt was launched for McTear who had previous convictions for domestic violence and other violent crimes. He was found hiding at a friend's house several hours after the incident and was arrested by police. Bedwell, . who was then 17, told police her ex-boyfriend grabbed her son and threw . him down onto the pavement. He then picked him up in his carrier and raced off. Police were about to issue an Amber . Alert until the baby's body was found by the side of . I-275, the main motorway leading into Tampa on Florida's Gulf Coast. TV . cameraman Bird, who was on his way to work for a local station, said: . 'Just out of the corner of my eye, I thought I saw some trash on the . side of the road. But the more I thought about it, I saw eyes. 'It flipped me out, and I started shaking and said, 'It's a doll, a baby doll.' ' Police in Florida said at the time that Bedwell had previously sought a court injunction to keep McTear away from her family. Troubled history: Jasmine Bedwell (pictured left in 2009) became pregnant again after losing her son but her second child was taken away by the state in 2012 . The matter was dropped, though, after she failed to turn up for a court hearing. In 2010, Jasmine Bedwell found out she was pregnant again and gave birth to another son in September of that year. But . in January of 2012, she had her second child taken away by the . Department of Children and Families after a judge ruled the boy, A'Jon, . was in danger. Her boyfriend at the time had been convicted of cocaine and marijuana distribution and carrying a concealed weapon.","Richard McTear was found guilty of first-degree murder and other charges in the 2009 death of a three-month-old baby boy .

"These appalling photos reveal the largely unknown damage that abandoned fishing gear dubbed 'ghost nets' in a new campaign is doing to animals in the ocean surrounding Australia. Turtles are the main victims that get trapped in abandoned nets in the Gulf of Carpentaria in northern Australia and experts estimate there could have been 14,000 that have died over the last nine years, large numbers of seals are also getting caught up in the nets across the country's waters. World Animal Protection has launched the Sea Change campaign with the aim to make fishermen, fisheries and the general public more aware of this problem and they want to save one million animals by 2018. Scroll down for video . Experts say up to 14,000 turtles could have died at the Gulf of Carpentaria, northern Australia in the last nine years . A global campaign has started to raise awareness about abandoned fishing gear in the oceans which kill animals . Large numbers of seals are also getting caught in abandoned nets across Australian waters . World Animal Protection says it wants to save one million animals by 2018 with the global campaign it has launched . Nicola Beynon, campaigns manager for the Australian branch of World Animal Protection, told Daily Mail Australia said that due to sea currents some of the largest numbers of ghost nets wash up at the Gulf of Carpentaria in northern Australia. She said: 'Fishermen lose their nets for a number of reasons and it might not be deliberate but rough seas can mean the nets get damaged and the fisherman has trouble and may think 'I might as well cut it free'. 'These abandoned nets are death traps for sea animals. 'The Gulf of Carpentaria sees some of the highest numbers of nets washed up because of the sea currents bringing them across from Indonesia. 'In Indonesia there are so many boats competing for space and a trawler will come through and the nets might break and they end up lost in the ocean for decades. 'The main part of the campaign is to raise awareness of this and get stakeholders, the fishing industry and politicians involved so we can raise awareness of this hugely unknown problem.' A turtle is cut free from a ghost net which it has become entangled in, experts say the problem is bad in northern Australia . A horrific close up shot of some of the dead sea animals which have been found in the ghost nets . Ms Beynon said scientists estimate globally 136,000 seals, sea lions and whales have died due to the ghost nets after getting entangled in them. She said: 'This is a huge problem and it's not just sea turtles which are the main victims, these nets are also killing stingrays, sharks and sea birds. 'They endure awful suffering and there are high fatalities. 'People just don't know about it and that is why we have started this campaign.' The Gulf of Carpentaria sees the highest number of ghost nets wash up than any other place in Oceania, according to Ms Beynon. She said: 'This is because of the intense fishing in Indonesia because of the currents in the Tirmor and Arafura Seas.

"An elderly man who preyed on disadvantaged and disabled boys under his care at a Melbourne orphanage during the 1960s has been jailed for three months. Ronald Buckley, 93, of Geelong, had pleaded guilty to four counts of indecent assault against boys who lived at the orphanage he ran for 26 years. Because of his advanced age and the inability of Corrections Victoria to properly deal with his vulnerability in prison, prosecutors did not ask for an immediate term of imprisonment. Judge Mark Dean sentenced Ronald Buckley, 93, to three months prison . The orphanage: Ronald Buckley preyed on disadvantaged and disabled boys at the Hillside Boys Home, a court heard . County Court judge Mark Dean said jail was the only appropriate response for Mr Buckley's crimes . But Victorian County Court Judge Mark Dean said jail was the only appropriate response to his crimes. Judge Dean said Buckley targeted vulnerable children to satisfy his criminal and amoral sexual desires and it was clear the attacks he admitted to took place in the context of other offending. 'It was your primary responsibility to secure the welfare of vulnerable children in your care. Instead, you sexually abused them,' Judge Dean said on Thursday. The orphanage housed boys from broken homes, and many of them had behavioural issues, mental and physical illnesses and intellectual disabilities. Judge Dean said the four victims, aged between nine and 14 at the time of the offending, had suffered from complex depressive illnesses characterised by substance abuse and suicidal ideation as a result of the abuse. He said Buckley, who requires the use of a walking frame, expressed no remorse or empathy. Judge Dean jailed Buckley for 18 months, but suspended 15 months of the jail term.

The new parents constantly get skin-to-skin contact with their daughter and have been documenting everything on camera. 'Michelle had her last radiation therapy on Wednesday and she starts chemotherapy on Friday,' Mr Ansalone said. 'She's obviously feeling pretty tired right now and it's hard for her to get around.

"Behind the wheel: Prionda Hill told police God wanted to drive her car when she let go of the wheel and rammed Anthony Oliveri . An Indiana woman was arrested last week after she ran over a motorcyclist, fled the scene and told cops that God told her to let him take the wheel. Prionda Hill, 25, of Fort Wayne, mowed down Anthony Oliveri, 47, and his motorcycle July 11 just before 10.00 p.m., police said. ‘She was driving and out of nowhere God told her that he would take it from here and she let go of the wheel and let him take it,’ police claim she told them. Oliveri said he was riding his Harley Davidson motorcycle down a busy street when the bizarre incident occurred. He said Hill ran over both him and his bike with her 2006 Pontiac Grand Prix. ‘I remember it happened and I didn’t quite know what was going on for a split second,’ he recalled to WANE. Hill told police she rammed the bike shortly after letting go of the wheel. The impact threw Oliveri from the bike. ‘As I grabbed the handle bars as the bike was losing control and I looked back around my left shoulder, all I see is her tire and the left bumper getting ready to run my face over. ‘I was inches from that bumper and I just said to myself today is the day I die,’ he continued. ‘I just shut my eyes and said if this is the way that God wants to do it then I guess that this is the way we’re going to do it,’ Instead of crushing Oliveri's head, which would have meant sure death, it motored over his torso and left him with relatively minor injuries. Lucky to be alive: Anthony Oliveri survived being run over by a car with only minor injuries . Oliveri fortunately only suffered a few broken ribs and other minor injuries including road rash. He has already been discharged from the hospital and is expected to make a full recovery. Hill also rammed into a pickup truck before she wound up at a nearby fast food restaurant where police arrested her. The woman was not drunk at the time, police said, but did claim to have a prescription for Vicodin - a strong painkiller. She even volunteered there was nothing mechanically wrong with her car. Hill was charged Thursday with failing to stop an accident, criminal recklessness and two counts of criminal mischief.","Prionda Hill, 25, told police she ran over 47-year-old Anthony Oliveri because God insisted he be allowed to drive her car .
