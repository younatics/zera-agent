One miner died and another was injured Friday after they became trapped in a cave-in at a central Utah coal mine, authorities said. The cave-in was reported earlier in the day at a mine in Bear Canyon, about 10 miles west of the small mining town of Huntington, the Emery County sheriff's office said. Rescuers freed one man but were unable to save the other miner, officials said. A rescue team recovered the body of the second miner. Pretty dangerous: One man died and another was injured in a Utah coal mine cave-in near Huntington (pictured) Friday . Huntington Mayor Hilary Gordon identified him as 28-year-old Elam Jones, whose mother is a Huntington city councilwoman. The injured miner, who has not been identified, was treated and released from Castleview Hospital in Price. The mine is part of the Castle Valley Mining Complex. Preliminary information showed that a . roof fall occurred on a pillaring section of the mine after a large rock . fell, according to federal mine safety officials. The Mine Safety and . Health Administration was investigating, said spokesman Jesse Lawder. Not again: The collapse occurred in a mine at Bear Canyon in Emery County, Utah, the same county where 9 died in 2007's Crandall Canyon Mine disaster . Kentucky-based Rhino Resources bought the mining complex, which has 26.1 million tons of coal reserves, in August 2010, according to its website. Federal records show one injury was reported at the mine last year. Such tragedies are familiar to those who live in the area, which depends largely on mining for its economy. The mine is in the same county where the Crandall Canyon Mine collapsed in 2007, killing nine people. The operator of that mine, Genwal . Resources Inc., an affiliate of Ohio-based Murray Energy Corp., reached a . $949,351 settlement in 2012 with the Mine Safety and Health . Administration over safety violations. So sad: The 28-year-old who died was the son of a councilwoman from the small mining town of Huntington (pictured here in 2007) Gordon, who was mayor during the Crandall Canyon collapse, told KSL-TV and the Deseret News that the latest mine collapse brought back memories of that disaster. ‘Whenever there's a cave-in at any of the mines, you hold your breath,’ she said. ‘Coal is very powerful, and Mother Nature is very powerful.’ Jones helped in the rescue of miners at Crandall Canyon and later spoke at a vigil for those who died and were injured there, according to the Tribune. ‘Everybody who was up there put in 100 percent,’ said Jones, 23 at the time. ‘We did everything we possibly could. But the mountain won't let us do nothing else.’","The collapse occurred in the same county as the deadly 2007 Crandall Canyon Mine disaster, which killed 9 .

Police in New York City are questioning a person of interest dubbed ‘John Doe Duffle Bags' who has been linked to at least two of three deadly Brooklyn shootings targeting businessmen of Middle Eastern descent. The balding, moustachioed man was taken in for questioning in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bay Ridge Tuesday. Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne noted that at this time, the unnamed man is not under arrest and is not being called a suspect. Scroll down for videos . Revealed: The balding, mustachioed man dubbed 'John Doe Duffle Bags' who was seen near at least two crime scenes in Brooklyn voluntarily submitted himself for questioning Tuesday . The person of interest, who was caught on surveillance video carrying bags in the vicinity of at least two crime scenes, voluntarily entered the 68th Precinct in Bay Ridge to be interviewed by police, according to New York Daily News. He was later transferee to another police location for additional questioning. Police have yet to release his name, but law enforcement sources said he is from Staten Island and is believed to be the man whose image was captured most clearly near the latest murder scene in Flatbush. ‘We’re talking to somebody who fits the description of the man in the (video). He came in voluntarily,’ Browne said. Three store owners have been killed in . their shops over the past four months and the killings are connected as . all three were shot with the same .22 caliber handgun. Ballistics tests matched in each killing, all of which occurred in Brooklyn shops with an '8' in the address. The latest suspect, ‘John Doe Duffle Bag’, was caught on surveillance footage a block and a half away from the Flatbush store where Rahmatollah Vahidipour was killed on Friday evening. Minutes later, the same moustachioed-man is seen in a different video two blocks away from the store. Murdered: Vahidipour Rahmatollah was killed with three gunshots, but it seems nothing was stolen . The New York Post reports that a different surveillance camera, located by the scene of the second murder in Bensonhurst also shows the same man. The video is of poorer quality, but they feel confident that the same duffle bag-toting man was in the area around the time that shopkeeper Isaac Kadare was killed on August 2. ‘”John Doe Duffle Bag” wore a long overcoat and carried a duffel bag,’ police commissioner Ray Kelly said. ‘He was seen in the vicinity of Vahidipour’s store just after 6 p.m. The shop owner’s body was found at 7.11pm.’ This is not the first person-of-interest in the case, and a number have since been ruled out. Previously unidentified suspects, dubbed ‘Jane Doe Green Jacket’ and ‘John Doe Bubble Jacket’, were on the police’s watch list since they were seen in the area of Vahidipour’s shop at the time of the murder. They have since been eliminated from the suspect pool as it turns out that ‘Green Jacket’ stole a bottle of perfume from street vendor ‘Bubble Jacket’ who was chasing after her following the theft. Two remaining possibilities are ‘Jane Doe Long Coat’, a woman who was seen near the crime scene wearing sunglasses and a scarf. Looking for the man: He appeared near at least two of the three crime scenes over the past four months . Near the scene: None of the stores where the shootings took place had video cameras inside . There also was a police sketch released following the first murder that took place earlier in the summer at a 99 cent store that left Mohammed Gebeli dead on July 6. That possible suspect was a man with . dark skin and wearing sunglasses, who witnesses described as being . ‘disturbed’ and talking to himself about putting a bullet in someone’s . head. That man is said to be roughly 5-foot-5 and around 140 pounds. The Daily News reports that the shop owner Vahidipour of Great Neck was behind the counter of She She in Brooklyn's . Flatbush section when he was shot Friday night. The gunman . dragged the victim's body toward the back of the store and covered it . with clothing. Victims: Isaac Kadare and Mohammed Gebeli were killed by the same handgun earlier this year . Police found the 78-year-old with two gunshot wounds to the head and one to the torso, DNA Info reported. On . the floor of the shop were the killer's calling card: shell casings . matching casings left at the scenes of the last two homicides. 'Now it's like he's telling us, 'It's me again,'' a police source told the New York Daily News. casings that police have matched to two other murders. “Now it’s like he’s telling us, ‘It’s me again,’ ” a police source said. The way Rahmatollah's body was hidden was also consistent with the previous shootings. On July 6, Mohammed Gebeli, 65, was found shot through the neck in his Bay Ridge clothing shop. His body was also hidden. Police believe the methodical killer does this to buy himself more getaway time by delaying the discovery of the bodies. 'I hope they catch the son of a b****,' Gebeli's son, Mourad said. When Rahmoatollah didn't come home at the usual time Friday his family called the police, who discovered his body. It wasn't not clear if the killer actually took anything, or if the murder was his sole motivation. 'He never had in his whole life one enemy, he didn't have, he was a very . kind man,' his sobbing wife, Naima Rahmatollah, told reporters. Suspect: Following one homicide at a 99 cent store that used the same gun, police released this sketch of the suspect . Saturday he was supposed to be at his grandson’s Bar Mitzvah. Police believe the murderer had been . watching the store in preparation for the attack, noting that he'd . chosen a shop with no security cameras. Issac Kadare, 59, was found dead in his Bensonhurst store at 1877 . 86th St., was shot in the head and stabbed in the neck. Besides owning stores, each victim was of Middle Eastern descent, prompting suspicion the killer could be racially motivated. It appeared nothing was taken from Rahmatollah's shop but both Kadare and Gebeli had money taken from them, and it remains unclear whether robbery is a motive. Unguarded: believe the killer was attracted to the store because, as with previous crime scenes, there were no cameras . Fernando Mateo of the Bodega Association of the U.S. said they were sending copies of the police sketch to their members but were mostly concerned with those fitting the previous victim's description. 'The only members that we would be concerned about are Middle Easterners,' he said. It's also possible the killer has a fascination with numerology, as the address for each homicide includes the number 8: Kadare at 1877 86th St., Gebeli at 7718 5th Ave., and Rahmatollah at 834 Flatbush Ave. None of the stores had working surveillance cameras. Scene: Police believe the killer may have been casing the shop, as it had no security cameras to catch him in the act . Neighbors called Rahmoatollah a 'neighborhood staple.' 'He was a regular guy,' said customer Xanius Patterson. 'He never hurt nobody.' Police are offering $12,000 for any information leading to the killer's arrest and conviction.

Salt: Game meatballs served at one of Jamie Oliver's restaurants contained almost one and a half times the maximum recommended daily amount of salt for an adult, researchers claim . Celebrity chefs have been accused of giving diners too much salt at their restaurant chains. Research by health campaigners found high salt levels in dishes served in the restaurants of chefs Gordon Ramsay, Marco Pierre White, Jamie Oliver and Raymond Blanc. The game meatballs served at one of Jamie Oliver’s restaurants contained nearly one and a half times the maximum amount of salt an adult is recommended to eat in a day, according to the study. The dish made with British pork and wild boar served at his chain Jamie’s Italian contained the equivalent to more than 20 bags of ready-salted crisps. But the study published by Consensus Action on Salt and Health (Cash) noted that salt levels could vary according to the chef on duty and praised Mr Oliver for his work reducing salt in meals. Jamie’s Italian also raised concerns about the reliability of the survey based on the limited sample size. At Gordon Ramsay’s restaurant, The Savoy Grill, his steamed mussels with cider cream sauce and fries contained 7.3grams of salt, more than a gram more than the recommended daily allowance (6g). Chain: On average Jamie's Italian had the highest level of salt in the three meals analysed as part of the survey . Cash found that out of 18 main meals surveyed at celebrity chef restaurants, nine contained more than 2.4g of salt per portion and would be labelled with a red traffic light if they had been on sale in a supermarket. A selection of three main meals were analysed for their salt content at six celebrity chef restaurants: Brasserie Blanc by Raymond Blanc, Dinner by Heston Blumenthal, Frankie's by Marco Pierre White, Jamie’s Italian by Jamie Oliver, Fifteen by Jamie Oliver, and the Savoy Grill by Gordon Ramsay. On average Jamie’s Italian had the highest level of salt in their three dishes tested, whilst Heston’s Dinner was shown to have the lowest values of salt. Celebrity chefs: Researchers also tested main meals served at Gordon Ramsay's (left) restaurant The Savoy Grill and Frankie's by Marco Pierre White (right) The Savoy Grill: The study by Consensus Action on Salt and Health (Cash) tested three main meals at Gordon Ramsay's restaurant inside the plush London hotel . Frankie's: Researchers tested the rib-eye steak with Bearnaise sauce and other main meals on the menu at Marco Pierre White's Frankie's . Government watchdog the Food Standards Agency claims the nation is consuming far too much salt, leading to an epidemic of high blood pressure and strokes. Graham MacGregor, Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at The Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Queen Mary University and chairman of Cash, said: ‘It’s a national scandal that there is still so much salt in our food. ‘Salt puts up our blood pressure, and as a result, thousands of people die unnecessarily each year from strokes, heart attacks and heart failure. ‘Whilst efforts have been made by foods in supermarkets to use less salt, chefs’ preference for saltier foods is preventing further progress. ‘It’s clear from our survey that some chefs are not listening to their customers. These chefs need to get their act together and stop shovelling salt in our food.’ Tests: Health campaigners highlighted the salt content in the smoked haddock and saffron risotto at Brasserie Blanc . Jamie’s Italian has categorically denied the findings of the study. The chain regularly carries out its own testing of the salt content of its meals and claims that the figure in the study for its meatball was unusually high. In the study, one sample was taken of three of the dishes at each of the celebrity chefs’ restaurants and the research noted that there ‘is huge variation in restaurant cooking practices of different chefs’. The study’s authors added: ‘Jamie’s Italian is in fact doing more to reduce salt in its meals than most other restaurants... we applaud Jamie’s commitment to reducing salt content and for signing up to the Department of Health’s Responsibility Deal Salt Catering Pledge, the first celebrity chef to do so.’ Jamie's Italian: Game meatballs .

The puppeteer and voice of Elmo has quit Sesame Street after a second underage sex claim has come to light. Kevin Clash, 52, a stalwart on Sesame Street for 28 years, has been accused by two men of having sex with them while they were underage. Last week Sheldon Stephens, . 23, accused Clash of having sex with him when he was a teenager, a charge Clash denied. A day later, Stephens recanted his charge after a $125,000 settlement had been struck with Clash's lawyers. A second lawsuit against Clash was filed on Tuesday by Cecil . Singleton, who claims he encountered Clash on a gay phone chat line in 1993 . when he was 15 and Clash was 32. The lawsuit seeks damages in excess of $5million. Scroll down to hear from Clash's Accuser . Scandal on Sesame Street: Elmo puppeteer Kevin Clash, 52, has resigned amid growing accusations that he slept with underage boys . Cecil Singleton claims Clash groomed him before they had sex when he was under age. He is seeking $5m . In the lawsuit filed in New York . City's federal court, Singleton alleges Clash groomed him by 'taking him . to nice dinners and giving him money.' In . its statement Tuesday, Sesame Workshop said 'the controversy . surrounding Kevin's personal life has become a distraction that none of . us want,' leading Clash to conclude 'that he can no longer be effective . in his job.' 'This is a sad day for Sesame Street,' the company said. In . a statement of his own, Clash said 'personal matters have diverted . attention away from the important work Sesame Street is doing and I . cannot allow it to go on any longer. I am deeply sorry to be leaving and . am looking forward to resolving these personal matters privately.' Clash created the high-pitched . voice and child-like persona for Elmo, a furry, red Muppet that became . one of the most popular characters on the show and one of the company's . most lucrative properties. Sesame Workshop produces Sesame Street in New . York. Since the scandal broke, Clash had been on a leave of absence from the Sesame Workshop which produces the . popular children's TV show on PBS. Sesame Workshop has insisted the scandal does not mean the end of Elmo. 'Elmo is bigger than any one person,' the company said. Resignation: Clash has left the popular children's show but that doesn't mean it's the end of the road for Elmo . Sheldon Stephens has claimed he was pressured into accepting a $125,000 settlement to retract his initial allegations . Clash, 52, had been on a leave of absence from the Sesame Workshop since the scandal broke . The resignation follows reports that Stephens, . 23, wanted to undo the $125,000 settlement he had struck with Clash's lawyers after making his original underage sex allegation. He has apparently met with . lawyers in Los Angeles and told them he was pressured into recanting his . allegation and insists he is telling the truth about having sex . with Clash when he was 16, reported TMZ. Stephens, a struggling actor/model, told lawyers he was willing to forfeit the $125,000 settlement to restore his name. Under . the terms of the current settlement, if Stephens is asked by anyone about his . relationship with Clash, he must repeat only the following statement: . 'He [Stephens] wants it to be known that his sexual relationship with . Mr Clash was an adult consensual relationship.' Accusations that Clash, who is openly . gay, engaged in an underage sexual affair set off a media firestorm . after they were revealed last Monday. Within 24 hours of the story . breaking, Stephens recanted his claim. After Stephens had withdrawn his allegations, Clash told the New York Times through a . spokesman: 'I am relieved that this painful allegation has been put to . rest. I will not discuss it further.' In addition to his marquee role as Elmo, Clash had served as the . show's senior Muppet coordinator and Muppet captain. He won 23 daytime . Emmy awards and one prime-time Emmy. In 2006, he published an autobiography, My Life as a Furry Red . Monster, and was the subject of the 2011 documentary Being Elmo: A . Puppeteer's Journey. Though it remained unclear who might take over for Clash performing . as Elmo, other Sesame Street puppeteers have been trained to serve as . his stand-in, Sesame Workshop said. Clash . has been Elmo's puppeteer for two decades, performing on the show as . well as for PBS specials, DVD releases and TV movies, while earning nine . Daytime Emmy Awards. Clash exchanged messages with Stephens in 2010 in which he apologised for constantly talking about sex and promised to make all of his 'dreams come true.' The puppeteer told the man almost 30 years his junior . that he loved him and offered to buy him a ticket to visit him in New . York. Iconic: Clash created the voice and persona for Elmo, one of Sesame Street's most popular characters . Model: Sheldon Stephens, 23 of Pennsylvania, accused Elmo Muppeteer Kevin Clash of engaging in sex with him when he was underage . The Sesame Street stalwart, who had worked on the show since the mid-80s, admits to having a sexual . relationship with the accuser, but insists it only took place after the younger man was an adult. In emails sent well after the accuser turned 18, Clash wrote: 'I'm sorry that I keep talking about sex with you, its driving me insane.' He added: 'I want you to know that I love . you and I will never hurt you. I'm here to protect you and make sure . your dreams come true... 'I'll have my assistant book a ticket for you to come to NY and we can talk about this in person.' Clash said the relationship was between two consenting adults and that he was deeply . saddened that the younger man was 'trying to make it into something it was not.' The . accuser reportedly felt he was being silenced after his initial meeting with Sesame Street lawyers. In the spotlight: The Sesame Workshop called the controversy 'a distraction that none of us want' In August, the accuser's lawyers wrote a . letter to Sesame Street accusing the program of trying to 'discredit . the victim in order to protect its . employee and the image of one of its most valuable characters.' The letter also claimed the show's attitude 'places a greater value on a puppet than the well being of . a young man.' Sesame Workshop officials, however, said they found the allegation of underage sex was . unsubstantiated after a thorough . investigation. They say that rather than trying to hush up the accuser, they asked for evidence of his allegations, which was not received. Sesame Street disciplined Clash . for inappropriate use of company email after they found his messages to . Stephens but they reportedly did not indicate an illegal sexual . relationship. They said the divorced . father of a 19-year-old girl had shown poor judgment, but originally . claimed his leave of absence would allow him to defend his reputation in . the wake of the damaging allegations.","Elmo puppeteer Kevin Clash, 52, has resigned amid growing allegations .

Around one in five European students have disappeared without paying back millions of pounds in loans to study at British universities. Twenty-two per cent of students from EU member states have not be 'traced' after graduating - leaving UK taxpayers to pick up the bill. A study by the House of . Commons library, reported by the Daily Telegraph, revealed that EU . students were much less likely to repay . their loans at all and more likely to go missing. Studying: Students from EU member states are allowed to apply for government loans to take UK courses . In the past six years almost £400 million in Government loans had been . made to students from Europe. UK taxpayers handed out more than £100 million in loans in 2010-2011 to fund the UK education of those from countries such as Germany, France, Cyprus, . Romania, Lithuania and Bulgaria. These students can apply for the same government support as British students to complete courses here, but critics do not believe the repayment of their debt is as vigorous in their own countries. The UK system of repayment means students reduce their debt with direct payments to the taxman through PAYE when salaries are over . £21,000 a year. Working: Almost a quarter of EU students disappeared without making repayments on their loans . There are fears that hundreds . of millions of pounds in loans to EU students may be written off and the bill is . likely to rise with the introduction of tuition fees of up to . £9,000 for the first time last September. The Telegraph reported that Parliamentary research carried out for Hertsmere Conservative MP James Clappison, analysed EU students who claimed loans up to 2010. It found that EU students were 'much more likely to have not been traced' after graduating, with 22 per cent failing to tell the Student Loans Company where they were. This compared with just two per cent of all borrowers. Mr Clappison told the paper: 'I think this should raise serious questions with the Government about how effective we are at getting our money back through the student loans system.

'Nothing happened that evening that is non-consensual.

'I realize that I did, I was doing wrong by drinking and partying, you know, after dark,' Richmond told ABC just before he was found guilty. 'But I really did not, I didn’t rape anybody.

Tens of thousands of vulnerable care patients say they feel at risk from abuse, are allowed to go hungry and are often left unwashed, according to a shocking Government survey. It found that one in three adults who are in residential care or receiving help at home fear abuse or physical harm – equivalent to about half a million people. Others complained they received so little food and drink that they believed their health could suffer. Charities claimed last night that the survey showed the system was in  ‘massive crisis’ and warned that the problems could get even worse as cash-strapped local authorities targeted care budgets for further cuts. Revelations: Tens of thousands of vulnerable care . patients say they feel at risk from abuse, are allowed to go hungry and . are often left unwashed, according to a shocking Government survey . About 1.5 million people in England – most of whom are elderly or disabled – receive basic care funded wholly or in part by local authorities because they have issues with mobility, have ongoing health issues or are dependent on  alcohol or drugs. The Adult Social Care Survey, which was carried out by the Department of Health, regulator the Care Quality Commission and the NHS’s Health and Social Care Information Centre, found: . The care received by 89-year-old Ann Joyce in her residential home is ‘woefully inadequate’, according to her daughter Jacqueline Grattan.Ann, from Essex, has bone cancer and dementia, and has been in the care system for three years. Art gallery owner Jacqueline, who lives in Wormley, Hertfordshire, said: ‘We keep being told the staffing levels comply with Government guidelines, but there are never enough people on duty to deal with basic needs like toileting. ‘The staff are supposed to have dementia training but  I have never seen any of them talk to my mother or try to keep her mind active. ‘If she says no to a cup of tea or glass of water, they leave it at that, although she can’t express her wishes. As a result, she is constantly dehydrated and unable to fight off infections. ‘In my mother’s unit there are supposed to be five staff for  28 patients, but one or two care assistants are invariably off. 'My mother sometimes has to wait 40 minutes to be toileted and that can’t be right, whatever the Government guidelines say. ‘The staff work hard. They are on the go all the time but they are badly managed. If you asked me whether my mother feels safe and secure, I would say no.’ A spokesman for Barchester Care Homes, which runs the home where Ann lives, said: . ‘The safety, health and wellbeing of our residents is of the utmost importance. Our staff  are highly qualified and dedicated, and residents are offered access  to activities and excursions.’ England’s 152 local authorities were each asked to send the survey to at least 300 people receiving social care, who were selected at random. Nearly 63,000 completed the poll between January and March last year. A third said they did not feel as safe as they would like, while two per cent said they did not feel safe at all. But in some areas, such as Brent, . North-West London, more than 50 per cent claimed they did not feel safe, . while in Hartlepool, Co Durham, St Helens, Merseyside, and Tameside, . Greater Manchester, more than 40 per cent said social care services did . not make them feel safe. The report did not reveal why people felt unsafe or who they feared might cause them harm. At . the same time, 2,500 people – four per cent of those surveyed – claimed . that they did not get enough food and drink. This rose to 9.2 per cent . in Westminster, Central London, and 8.8 per cent in Manchester. An . additional one per cent – 630 people – said they got so little food and . drink that they believed there was a risk to their health. And 44 per . cent said they did not feel as clean and as well-presented as they would . like, with six per cent claiming they felt less than adequately clean. One per cent claimed the way they were treated ‘completely undermines the way I think and feel about myself’. Liz Kendall, Labour’s care spokesman, said the study was a damning indictment of England’s £17 billion-a-year care industry. ‘These figures are deeply concerning but they represent only part of what’s going on and that’s not good enough,’ she said. ‘The . Government must ask why people are not feeling safe, and this . information should be fed back to providers, commissioners and families. We need to know what’s going on here in depth. ‘I . suspect part of the problem is how isolated many elderly and disabled . people feel while in care, separated from their families. But a lack of . funding and the high turnover of carers also mean many receiving care in . their own homes don’t know the people who are coming to help them, and . basic compassion is lacking.’ Worrying: Up to 50 per cent of those . questioned in the NHS survey in some areas said they felt unsafe because they believed . they were at risk of abuse or physical harm (file picture) Michelle Mitchell, charity director . general at Age UK, said: ‘By neglecting the social care system for so . long, governments have put the human rights, health and dignity of too . many at risk. ‘Many older . people are worrying about having enough food to eat, and feel unsafe . and unable to present themselves in a way that retains their dignity. How can this be acceptable in a civilised society?’ Health . Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘The quality of care needs to be valued as . highly as the quality of treatment. There can be no hiding place for . those providing poor care. We have protected access to care by investing . £7.2 billion over four years, but we also want to drive up standards so . everyone gets the service they have the right to expect.’ More than 50 different carers  in a year have been sent to one  80-year-old stroke victim, who is looked after in his own home. Retired accountant Richard has had two strokes in two years and is housebound. He was offered a residential care place after his first stroke, but his wife Helen, 75, asked that he be allowed to continue living at their home in Darlington, Co Durham. The couple now rely on a succession of young care assistants, part-funded by the local authority, who visit four times a day to help get Richard out of bed and dressed, feed  him and put him to bed. Helen said that while many  of the carers were ‘wonderful’, she had been left frustrated by the lack of training and high turnover of staff. ‘I keep a diary and in the past year we’ve had 56 different carers – only six of them men,’ she said. ‘Richard has a care plan but they don’t read it so I’m on edge all the time, wondering what they are going to do next. ‘It can be very frustrating. One of the girls we had was a 17-year-old who went straight from working at Burger King to looking after my husband. They don’t get the training they need – it’s not just a case of making a cup of tea and having a chat. ‘Richard has to have everything done for him, including washing and toileting, because he can’t get around on his own. They never call ahead if they’re running late. ‘Whoever runs the care system, I would like to go in there and shake them all up.’ Both the couple’s real names have been withheld because Helen is worried about possible repercussions from the carers who visit their home. ‘Some of the girls who come  in to help can be slightly vindictive and I wouldn’t want them to react badly to criticism,’ she said.","Charities claim the Government survey shows 'massive crisis' in the system .

"By . Nick Craven and Martyn Halle . PUBLISHED: . 19:46 EST, 23 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:47 EST, 23 March 2013 . A senior surgeon has been banned from operating at a children’s heart unit facing closure after it was condemned for excessive death rates. The consultant surgeon at Leeds Children’s Hospital last week agreed not to conduct any more procedures until concerns raised about ‘aspects of his practice’ were investigated. The hospital, already earmarked to lose its cardiac surgery department under an NHS review, last night refused to name the surgeon – one of only four in the cardiac department – and had released no public information about his agreement to cease surgery until contacted by The Mail on Sunday. A spokesman said it had a ‘duty as an employer’ not to name the surgeon. Crisis: Leeds hospital is already earmarked to lose its cardiac surgery unit . Last year, the Children’s Heart Federation said it had ‘major concerns’ about standards of care at Leeds, claiming some babies had been sent home to die and called for an investigation following feedback from parents. The safety of children’s heart surgery at Leeds was also raised two years ago with the Care Quality Commission health watchdog when a report found there had been 20 ‘excess’ or unexpected deaths over eight years to 2008. Hospital bosses stressed the new concerns were not related to mortality or morbidity figures or the row over transferring patients. But they admitted the consultant was already under an earlier restriction from carrying out certain procedures. In a statement, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said: ‘A surgeon in our paediatric cardiac team has agreed not to carry out operations until we have completed an assessment of aspects of his surgical practice. He has been subject to a specific restriction on his practice over a period of time and we review the position on a regular basis. ‘This professional review is being carried out within the trust. It is viewed as best practice and is part of running a safe service.’ Leeds is one of three children’s heart units to be closed after a review in the wake of the Bristol heart scandal in the Nineties in which 35 babies died and dozens more were left brain-damaged. It sparked a sea change in the way mortality rates in hospitals are monitored, especially in cardiac care. In recent months, a huge legal campaign, backed by publicity, has been mounted to keep heart surgery at Leeds following last year’s Safe and Sustainable NHS review, which recommended all surgery be transferred to better-equipped Newcastle. Leeds is one of three children's heart units to be closed after a review in the wake of the Bristol heart scandal in the nineties in which 35 babies died and dozens more were left brain-damaged . The campaign won the first round of a High Court judicial review, which found parts of the NHS consultation had been ‘flawed’. The NHS vowed to continue the closure plans, though another court hearing is due this week. Last night there were calls for operations at Leeds to be suspended to protect children from sub-standard surgery. One leading paediatric cardiologist said: ‘We don’t want another Bristol where all those children lost their lives. There should be decisive action as there was when there similar problems at Oxford in 2010. Then they just stopped doing surgery and it never resumed.’ A senior expert on children’s heart surgery last night said Leeds General Infirmary ‘ought to put the safety of children first’. He said: ‘When we were looking at the reorganisation of children’s heart surgery nationally, Leeds was bottom of the table. If there have been two incidents where surgeons have had stop performing certain operations, it would suggest there are serious issues that need addressing. 'Our number one priority has to be the children needing heart surgery. And they should be getting the best care possible, however far they have to travel to get it.’ The adviser, who worked for former Health Secretary Andrew Lansley, said: ‘We have been trying to reorganise children’s heart surgery for four years and are still unable to implement our plans because of campaigns like the one in Leeds. Based on the inspection reports of the various centres, Leeds did not do very well. The case for keeping paediatric surgery at Leeds is an emotional one. ‘One can understand support for a local centre, where some children have done well, but overall, looking at the interests of all patients, Leeds does not meet the standard. ‘On clinical outcomes, they are misguided. What the campaigners have to think about is all results, not individual personal experiences.’ The reorganisation of paediatric heart surgery has been delayed for many years following publication of the Kennedy Report into the Bristol Heart Babies scandal. Although that report led to the raising of standards, the spread of services over 14 centres is thought to have resulted in children being at risk from surgeons inexperienced in certain types of surgery. Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS Medical Director, said five years ago it would be a ‘stain on the profession’ if paediatric heart surgery wasn’t reorganised.","One of four consultant surgeons from Leeds Children's Hospital cardiac unit agreed not to conduct further procedures .

John Prescott wrote in a Sunday newspaper that he wanted to pass on concerns that the Queen was 'overburdening' herself . John Prescott has come under fire for suggesting the Queen should abdicate because of her recent bout of ill-health. The former deputy prime minister said he wanted to pass on concerns that the 86-year-old monarch was 'overburdening' herself. As a former Cabinet minister, Mr Prescott sits on the Privy Council. In his column for a Sunday newspaper, he wrote: ‘Last week a straight-talking Yorkie friend asked me what Privy Councillors do. I said we formally advise the Queen. ‘Now, my friend is a staunch royalist but he said something which got me thinking. ‘His concern was that the Queen, who is 87 next month, is overburdening herself. He said she had done a remarkable job over her 60 years on the throne but was increasingly concerned at recent cancellations of public duties because of her ongoing ill-health. ‘My friend noted the monarch would be delivering her 61st Queen’s Speech in May, where she’ll announce her future trips abroad, on top of her many other public duties. ‘So he asked me, as a Privy Councillor, to tell her that he didn’t expect her to see out her royal duties as the Queen. She deserves a break and he wouldn’t think less of her if she stepped down.’ Mr Prescott added: ‘The point is important as we’ll all become more concerned for the heavy load she continues to carry as Head of State. She has given wise counsel to 12 prime ministers, from Churchill to Cameron, and has made her mark on the country she loves.’ Queen Elizabeth looked the picture of health during her visit to the London Underground this month . She recently had to cancel a number of engagements after a bout of ill health but was all smiles during the visit . He wrote: ‘I’m not sure whether the . Queen reads the Sunday Mirror, or indeed my column. But if you do, . Ma’am, I thought I’d pass on my friend’s concern. ‘He feels you have done so much for . the UK and the Commonwealth that you deserve to break convention and . consider enjoying a long and fulfilling retirement. ‘I’d . be interested to hear readers’ thoughts. Why not email me? Hopefully . I’ll be able to read them on my phone if I end up in the Tower!’ Last night Tory MPs lined up to lambast Lord Prescott over his comments. Conor Burns said: ‘John Prescott is the antithesis of the Queen. She is a model of selfless public service and duty. He is frittering away any last vestiges of dignity his career had with these sort of pig-ignorant comments. ‘Luckily for Her subjects I’m sure the Queen will ignore his silly advice.’ George Freeman said: ‘God save us. Never has this poor nation been more in need of the Queen’s quiet and understated wisdom, leadership and tireless public duty. MPs Jacob Rees-Mogg, right, and Mark Field, left, were among those queuing up to criticise Lord Prescott . ‘After a decade of Blair and Prescott’s . “get rich quick” cronyism, Her Majesty The Queen’s reign is one of the . few things in Britain the public still trust and have confidence in. May . she long reign over us.’ Mark Field added: ‘I think it is inappropriate for anyone in politics to speculate on the Monarch’s health. ‘What is clear is that she is very capable of handling a very big schedule. Under no circumstances will we see the Queen abdicate. It would undermine the very principle of monarchy. She continues to do a fantastic job.’ Robert Buckland said: ‘Lord Prescott fails to remember that the Queen took an oath to serve for the rest of her life. ‘It was an abdication that put her in direct line to the Throne, so I do not think that this is viewed by her as an option. Stop speculating and let her get on with the job.’ And Jacob Rees-Mogg said: ‘The Queen is anointed our Sovereign for life. It is a vocation not a job. Lord Prescott should remember his oath as a Privy Counsellor and as a peer.’ The Queen has repeatedly said that she does not plan to abdicate. Buckingham Palace declined to comment yesterday.","Said he wanted to pass on concerns the Queen was 'overburdening' herself .

A former NFL cheerleader is accused of following a 12-year-old boy into a bathroom, fondling his penis and offering to perform oral sex on him but she claims she's innocent because she 'thought he was a man.' Elizabeth 'Leigh' Garner from Nashville, Tennessee, was charged last week with sexual battery and solicitation of a minor for child rape in the February incident. According to Murfreesboro police, the married 42-year-old, who cheered three seasons for the Tennessee Titans until 2008, was at a party when she tried to seduce the boy, who is understood to be the son of the host. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Accused: Elizabeth 'Leigh' Garner, pictured, from Nashville, Tennessee, was charged last week with sexual battery and solicitation of a minor for child rape in the February incident . The boy told police that Garner asked him whether he'd 'ever been with a woman' before she tried to pull down him pants. He then bolted from the bathroom and told his mother what happened, who reported her friend to police. Garner later told sex crimes detectives the alleged assault was all a misunderstanding, 'that she was drunk that evening and she got the boy confused with a man' who was also at the residence.

'If you can't tell the difference between a 12-year-old and an adult then there are problems.' According to WTVF, Garner gained a measure of fame while she was in the Titans' cheer squad because, at 38-year-old, she was considerably older than her fellow cheerleaders who were generally in their 20s. Numerous health and fitness blogs featured the busty blonde and her secrets to staying in shape when she made the team. Garner was released on a $30,000 bond and faces more than eight years' prison if she's convicted.

Garner and her husband, who she said on blog Chrissy Fitness in 2008 proposed to her during cheer-leading training with a dozen roses, seem to be sticking together through the allegations and defense that she thought the boy was another man. They spoke with WTVF together, to proclaim her innocence. In the interview with Chrissy Fitness, the 5' 2"" tall 110 pound woman said maintaining her cheerleader-worthy body was hard work. She said she hit the gym daily to maintain her envied physique, doing spins and turbo kicks and twice a week she factored in strength training with weights to sculpt her muscles.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:24 EST, 21 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:48 EST, 21 March 2013 . A married insurance agent who helped run a prostitution operation out of his mistress's Zumba studio and watched secretly videotaped sex acts was ordered on Thursday to spend 20 days in jail. Before being sentenced, Mark Strong apologized for the pain he'd caused his family after his seedy business venture not only rocked the quiet Maine town of Kennebunk, but caused a national outcry. Earlier his wife Julie - making her first appearance at the trial - had broken down in tears while making a plea to the judge for leniency for her husband who was found guilty of 12 counts of promoting prostitution and one of conspiracy two weeks ago. Family support: Mark Strong comforts his wife Julie after she became emotional while addressing the judge during Strong's sentencing on Thursday . 'I do apologize for each of my selfish actions and the harm that I have caused many. Most importantly I want to apologize to my wife, my two sons and my entire family because I've caused so much hurt in so many ways, emotionally, physically and financially,' Strong said, his voice choking. Prosecutors say Strong was involved in every facet of the Kennebunk operation with fitness instructor Alexis Wright, monitoring her calendar, reviewing her ledger, collecting dossiers on clients and watching the sexual encounters streamed to his office computer 100 miles away in Thomaston. Strong even suggested ways to boost profits by marketing to higher-paying fetish clients and engaging in paid sex acts with multiple men at the same time, prosecutors said. 'This was not a man in love. This was not a voyeur. This was hard-nosed businessman,' said Deputy York County District Attorney Justina McGettigan, who asked the judge to sentence Strong to 364 days in jail, noting that the prostitution continued last year even after police raided Wright's studio, office and apartment in Kennebunk. Happy family: Julie Strong leaves the count house in Portland, Maine after her husband received just a 20-day sentence for his role in the Zumba prostitution case . Mark Strong is taken to jail to start his 20-day sentence but will be out in time for his son's wedding . Defense lawyer Dan Lilley asked for a maximum of 14 days in jail, telling the judge that police and prosecutors were overzealous in an investigation into fizzled with only two defendants and mostly minor charges. 'The state wanted Moby Dick but got fish bait. This is relatively minor case that has become, or did become, a media event. The simple fact is that the media... has already punished Mark Strong,' Lilley said. Strong, 57, has acknowledged helping the 30-year-old Wright open her dance studio. He said he loaned her money that was repaid with interest, and that he didn't profit from prostitution. But prosecutors said Thursday that he received 20 percent of Wright's revenue from the prostitution business. In court, Strong told the judge that he should've owned up to his mistakes right away. United front: Mark Strong, wife Julie and their son Bradley hug during a recess at the hearing on Thursday . 'Initially I wondered why this happened to me and why I'm going through this hell, when I should have accepted responsibility and instead focused on making amends for those I hurt,' he said. His wife, Julie, arm-in-arm with their son, Brad, broke down in tears as she pleaded for leniency, telling the judge that her husband 'suffers from an illness that is curable.' She also said their marriage is better now that he's confronting his illness. 'What started as my worst nightmare I could ever imagine has turned into one of God's greatest gifts because God has given me a new marriage with a new man, and he is the man I always knew he was,' Julie Strong told the judge. 'When I first saw him and met him, I could see a kind and gentle soul. Nobody chooses to do what he does.' The court heard how Strong had received 20 percent of the revenue from Alexis Wright's prostitution business . Justice Nancy Mills credited law enforcement for being diligent in what was initially investigated as a statewide prostitution ring with the potential for extortion because clients had been videotaped without their knowledge. In sentencing Strong, she took into account that he had no criminal record, was a community leader in Thomaston and had strong family ties, as evidenced by more than a dozen family members in court to show support for Strong. But she said jail time was warranted because of the duration and extent of the operation in which prosecutors say Wright made more than $150,000 over an 18-month period. The judge imposed a 20-day sentence on the first count of promotion of prostitution, and concurrent sentences on the remaining 12 misdemeanor counts. After the hearing, the judge revoked bail and Strong was taken away in handcuffs to begin serving his term in the York County Jail. The judge said Strong would complete his jail term in time to see his son get married. Strong's attorney Dan Lilley, right, had asked the judge for a maximum of 14 days in jail . Wright, who now lives in Wells, is due to stand trial in May. She faces 106 counts including prostitution, privacy violations, tax offenses and welfare fraud. She met with prosecutors earlier this moth to discuss pleading guilty, but she failed to reach a deal. Wright, 30, looked striking in heels and a short skirt covered by a long wool coat as she walked into and out of the Cumberland County Courthouse in Portland, Maine. She smiled and seemed to enjoy the gaggle of TV cameras and reporters who chased after her following five hours of negotiations with prosecutors, according to the Portland Press Herald. If Wright chooses to go to trial, she . faces evidence at least as damning as the videos and photos that led to . Strong's conviction. 'No comment': Wright smirked last week as she waded through a gang of TV cameras, but refused to talk about the 106 counts of prostitution, invasion of privacy and misuse of welfare benefits that she faces . No deal: Wright faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted of some of the felony charges that she faces. She and her lawyer failed to reach a plea deal with prosecutors last week . She and her lawyer Sarah Churchill negotiated with York County Deputy District Attorney Justina McGettigan for several hours. However, the two sides could not agree to a plea deal that would cut the sentence Wright potentially faces. Among the charges against Wright are several felonies, for which she faces up to ten years in prison. The prostitution case rocked the small town of Kennebunk and ensnared at least 65 men who paid Wright for sex. Her clients include prominent businessmen, attorneys and even a former mayor. Stacked deck: Wright will face that same damning evidence, and likely more, that led to Strong's conviction if she decides to take the charges to trial .","Mark Strong has been jailed for 20 days for managing Alexis Wright's prostitution business based at her Zumba studio .

The relocation of a senior politico has seemingly ended the Obama administration's aims to close Guantanamo Bay, despite statements to the contrary . The special envoy responsible for overseeing the closure of the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay has been taken off the job in a clear sign that the Obama administration no longer plans to shut the facility down. On Monday the State Department reassigned Daniel Fried, the special envoy for closing the Cuban prison and will not replace him, according to an internal personnel announcement seen by The New York Times. His office will be closed and his former responsibilities, mainly working on diplomatic issues surrounding the relocation of detainees, will be folded into the office of the department’s legal adviser. The move seems to show that the Obama administration does not see the closing of the prison as a realistic priority, despite announcements by the President to the contrary. Mr. Fried will now work on issues including Iran and Syria as the department’s coordinator for sanctions policy. Mr. Fried’s special envoy post was created in 2009, shortly after Mr Obama took office and promised to close the prison in his first year. He traveled the world negotiating the repatriation of some 31 low-level detainees and persuading third-party countries to resettle about 40 who were cleared for release but could not be sent home because of fears of abuse. But as Congress imposed restrictions on further transfers, Mr Fried was eventually assigned to also work on resettling a group of Iranian exiles, the M.E.K., who were in a refugee camp in Iraq. Ian Moss, a spokesman for Mr. Fried’s office, said:'We remain committed to closing Guantánamo, and doing so in a responsible fashion. Detainees at Camp Delta at the U.S. Naval Base Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The facility has been at the centre of a number of controversies . Housed on a naval base in Cuba, the camp was set up to hold suspected terrorists captured on the battlefields of Afghanistan in early 2002A number of scandals have hit the site over its 10-year history. Allegations of mistreatment at the camp surfaced early on and the U.S. has faced frequent attacks from human rights groups for holding inmates without trial. The U.S. claim the prisoners are 'enemy combatants' who do not have the same rights of prisoners of war or U.S. citizens. There have also been numerous reports of inmates being tortured at the hands of their American captors. Three detainees committed suicide in 2006, although there were other failed attempts before that. During his 2008 campaign, Mr Obama described Guantanamo as a 'sad chapter in American history' and said the U.S. legal system was equipped to handle the detainees. According to the US authorities, 779 detainees have been held in Guantanamo and all but one of the 779 detainees were foreign nationals. As of December 2011, 171 men from more than 20 countries were still held at Guantanamo. 'The administration continues to express its opposition to Congressional restrictions that impede our ability to implement transfers.' The announcement came as Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and four other Guantánamo Bay detainees appeared before a military tribunal over the September 11 attacks. They made their first public appearance since October on Monday, sitting quietly in a high-security courtroom at the naval base in Cuba as pretrial hearings resumed. The five men were arraigned back in May of last year. Yesterday one of the prisoners fired one of his military attorneys in an apparent sign of distrust of his Pentagon-appointed legal counsel. Waleed bin Attash at first refused to speak when questioned by the judge about his desire to dismiss one of his three lawyers, Marine Corps Maj. William Hennessy. He hinted at his motivation later in an exchange with the judge about whether he wished to attend future sessions of the court. 'We have been dealing with our attorneys for about a year and a half and we have not been able to get any trust with them,' the Yemeni said through an Arabic translator. The dismissal of the attorney came at the start of what is expected to be a four-day hearing to address a wide range of pre-trial legal issues. Bin Attash is one of the lesser figures among the five defendants in the case. He allegedly ran an al-Qaida training camp in Afghanistan where two of the 19 hijackers in the terrorist attacks trained. He is also believed to have been a bodyguard for Osama bin Laden. Defendants in the military tribunal have civilian counsel in addition to military lawyers. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who has portrayed himself as the mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks, added an additional death penalty specialist, California lawyer Gary Sowards, to his team Monday.","Daniel Fried, who oversaw prisoner relocation, transferred to new role .

A patient died at scandal-hit Stafford Hospital as she pleaded with nurses ‘Help me’, a disciplinary hearing was told today. The woman had got her head stuck between a bed railing and begged for help, but nurse Ann King told an auxiliary worker: ‘Sit down - she’s fine’, the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) heard. By the time she was checked on the woman’s face had turned purple and she could not be resuscitated, the NMC was told. A patient died at scandal-hit Stafford Hospital as she pleaded with nurses 'Help me', a disciplinary hearing was told today . Mrs King’s case is the latest in a series of accusations against nurses at the hospital, where up to 1,200 patients died needlessly. The nurse is also accused of failing to recognise that another patient, who subsequently died, was diabetic. Mrs King and ward manager Jeannette Coulson are accused of making a number of blunders while working in the Trauma and Orthopaedics ward between 2005 and 2010. Their alleged failings came to light when a Healthcare support worker known as (HCSWA) and another nurse known as (SNA) blew the whistle. The woman who died in the railings had been admitted to the ward with a broken leg was said to be an alcoholic, and 'appeared to be agitated due to withdrawal'. ‘Patient A was in a side room and could not move from her bed without assistance due to her injury - she was awaiting surgery,’ said Rebecca Wood, for the NMC. ‘During the handover HCSWA could hear Patient A shouting for a bed pan and for some assistance. HCSWA tried several times to get up and attend to Patient A but was repeatedly told to sit down by nurse King. She told him the patient was fine, and that she seen to her earlier. ‘Patient A continued to shout and seemed to be getting more and more agitated and at one point shouted “help me, help me.”’ Ten minutes later the woman became silent and the auxiliary went to check on her, it was said. ‘As he approached the door he saw a puddle of urine coming from under the door and when he entered the room he found Patient A at the bottom of her bed with her head wedged in between the bars in an extended section that pulled put on a trolley for taller patients,’ Miss Wood said. ‘Patient A’s head was swollen and purple and she was not moving. The alarm was raised and emergency CPR commenced, but Patient A could not be resuscitated.’ King did not respond to patient requests, prevented HCSWA from attending promptly to the patient and did not ensure the woman’s safety, it is claimed. As ward manager, Mrs Coulson failed to ensure the patient’s safety, it is alleged. As the auxiliary left the patient’s room, he was pushed up against the wall by another nurse, Karen Salt, who said words to the effect of ‘keep your mouth shut,’ it is claimed. Mrs Coulson witnessed the incident and she looked over towards the assistant him as if to say she agreed with Ms Salt, the tribunal heard. Both nurses are also accused of failing to recognise that another patient who died under their care, Patient B, was diabetic. By the time she was checked on the woman's face had turned purple and she could not be resuscitated, the NMC was told. King's case is the latest in a series of accusations against nurses at the scandal hit Stafford Hospital where up to 1,200 patients died needlessly . The woman who had suffered from a stroke was admitted to A&E on April 1, 2007, and was transferred to the Trauma and Orthopaedics ward seven days later. While in A&E a doctor stated that her blood sugar levels should be checked hourly. Both Mrs King and Mrs Coulson deny ever being told the woman was diabetic. ‘If they had looked, they would have seen this information recorded in her notes,’ said Miss Wood. Describing the lead up to Patient B’s death Miss Wood said she had been checked my another nurse had asked for her blood sugar to be tested, and noted that it was very high. Due to a breakdown in communication Patient B did not receive her diabetes medication. On April 10, 2007 the patient was found collapsed in her bed. ‘Tests revealed that her blood sugar was now so high, it was off the charts,’ said Miss Wood. ‘An agreement was made with her family that Patient B should not be resuscitated of she arrested again.’ The woman died later that night. Both nurses had both failed to ensure adequate tests were carried out on the patient and failed to ensure adequate records of her care were kept. King denies all allegations against her, while Coulson admits using inappropriate language and replacing a sign that stated what times relatives could speak to staff after it had been taken down. She also admits refusing to accept a patient on the ward after surgery stating: ‘Get her off this f***ing ward’, and swearing at HCSWA when he was unwell. Neither of the nurses is attending the central London hearing. The hearing continues.

Nicolas Sarkozy is said to be in a 'state of incomprehension' today after being accused of accepting cash-stuffed envelopes from the richest woman in the world. The former French president has been charged with taking financial advantage of frail l'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt, 90. With his political career in ruins, Mr Sarkozy now faces a criminal trial and the possibility of going to prison. Worried: Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy, centre, is pictured leaving Bordeaux' courthouse last night . As his legal team was preparing to . appeal against the decision, political allies made it clear that he was . shell shocked as he returned from Bordeaux - where he was charged - to . the Paris home he shares with his third wife, former supermodel Carla . Bruni. 'As you can imagine he is in a state . of incomprehension,' said Jean-Francois Cope, president of Mr Sarkozy's . conservative UMP party. Francois Fillon, Mr Sarkozy's former . prime minister, went on to Twitter to say the decision was 'unfair' and . said 'the truth will triumph'. Mr Sarkozy's lawyer Thierry Herzog . also attacked the indictment as 'legally incoherent and unfair' saying . his client was being treated 'scandalously.' Accused: Nicolas Sarkozy, left, was last night formally charged with ‘abusing the weakness’ of the richest woman in the world, Liliane Bettencourt , right . Mr Sarkzoy was unexpectedly summoned on Thursday to the Bordeaux offices of Jean-Michel Gentil, the judge in charge of the case. There he met at least four former . members of Bettencourt's staff, who said Mr Sarkozy regularly turned up . at the Bettencourt mansion in Paris to accept cash to help fund his 2007 . election campaign. Mrs Bettencourt's doctors say her . mental capacity began to deteriorate from the autumn of 2006, meaning . she would have been particularly vulnerable to people asking her for . money. The principal allegation is that Mr . Sarkozy obtained up to 4 million euros from her, breaching electoral . spending limits and taking advantage of a person weakened by ill health. Jean-Michel Gentil, the judge in . charge, hoped to establish today how many times Mr Sarkozy actually . visited Mrs Bettencourt’s luxury Paris home in the months before he was . elected. Defeat: Sarkozy and his third wife Carla Bruni leave the Elysee Palace . as current French president Francois Hollande and his partner Valerie . Trierweiler look on . Mr Sarkozy insists that it was only once, despite many former Bettencourt staff members saying he was always popping round. The . principal allegation against Mr Sarkozy is that he took advantage of . the frail state of the aged widow to take money from her. Claire Thibout, Mrs Bettencourt’s . former accountant, told police in 2010 that she had handed cash-filled . envelopes to Bettencourt's financial manager, Patrice de Maistre, who . subsequently passed them on to Mr Sarkozy's campaign treasurer, Eric . Woerth. Mr Sarkozy is also said to have collected money in person. While Mr Sarkozy was being charged with the offences in Bordeaux, his wife Carla Bruni was in Berlin where she was performing at the Echo music awards. She is about to make a return to modelling starring in a campaign for Italian fashion house Bulgari. Top fashion photographer Terry Richardson reportedly photographed Bruni in Rome for the campaign this week. Ms Bruni has also recently completed a new album called Little French Songs in which she allegedly mocks current French Prime Minister Francois Hollande by referring to him as a penguin. Mr Sarkozy lost his immunity from . prosecution when he lost the 2012 presidential election to his Socialist . rival Francois Hollande. Within a few weeks, the home he shares with Ms Bruni was raided by anti-corruption police. Nicolas Sarkozy's wife the model and singer Carla Bruni-Sarkozy performs at the Echo Music Awards in Berlin, Germany . In 2011, Mr Sarkozy's predecessor, . Jacque Chirac, was found guilty on corruption charges related to his . time as mayor of Paris, and received a two-year suspended prison . sentence. Since losing to Mr Hollande, Mr . Sarkozy had been trying to make money on the international conference . circuit, but he also hinted that he might return to power in 2017. But he faces numerous other . corruption enquiries, including claims that he took cash from Colonel . Gaddafi, the late Libyan dictator. Despite all this, Sarkozy has . regularly hinted that he may still make a bid to return to the Elysee . Palace in 2017. This now looks an impossibility.

Mr Boyle, who was roundly praised for his work in masterminding London's £27 million Olympic opening ceremony, said he felt the positive impact of the Games before they started and after they ended. But he said the public has returned to their 'private battles', adding that it was 'naive' to hope the optimism of the Games would continue. 'I think it would be naive to say it could last,' he told The Sun. 'It's nice to have a filip like that to feel good together, then you get back to your private battles. 'Obviously we are in tough economic times which means it is difficult finding jobs for people.' Boyle turned down a knighthood for his work saying 'it’s just not me' despite being touted for the New Year Honours list for creating the highly praised spectacle. He said he would not have felt right accepting an individual award as a cast of thousands - including the Queen - helped create it. Thanks but no thanks: Mr Boyle, 56, was in line for the New Year Honours list for the highly praised event at the Olympic Stadium but turned it down . 'It’s just not me. I also thought it was wrong, actually,' he told the Radio Times. 'You can make these speeches about ""this is everybody’s work, blah blah blah"". 'And you’ve got to mean it, and I did mean it, and it is true, and it’s the only way you can carry on something like that: through the efforts of all the people. 'I don’t know whether I’ll ever get invited back to the Palace.' He and his artistic team sent a 'script' to Buckingham Palace. It was in the hope Queen would agree to a surprise appearance in the much loved James Bond skit, which saw her accompanied to the Games by Britain’s top secret agent.

Controversial: Homeowners should be given more freedom to improve their properties, planning minister Nick Boles, pictured, has declared . The Planning Minister has been caught on tape saying anyone can take advantage of George Osborne's Budget package to help home buyers. Despite Coalition denials that the plan will help the rich buy second homes, Nick Boles told an audience of property developers he 'couldn't care less who owns the bloody things'. He also claimed the Government was keen to create a house building boom, and pledged further relaxations of planning regulations to make it easier for people to extend or convert their homes without permission. The Chancellor announced in his Budget that £15.5billion was to be set aside to guarantee mortgages to help 644,000 people buy homes over the next three years. But Labour said that rather than helping struggling young people get on the housing ladder, it would subsidise well-off people buying second homes or buy-to-lets. Mr Boles's comments undermine the Government's subsequent denial. And his suggestion that ministers want to start a building boom will alarm green belt campaigners. Dan McLean, from the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: 'On the one hand, there could be good efforts through the Budget to stimulate more housebuilding, but on the other it appears to be at the expense of weakening the planning rules. 'The worrying aspect about this is that Nick Boles seems to be suggesting controls on planning and development should be reduced. 'The Government seems to be moving a long way from the localism the parties pledged when they were elected.' Mr Osborne said in his Budget on Wednesday that the Government would offer five-year interest-free loans worth up to 20 per cent of the value of new-build homes costing less than £600,000. It will also offer £12billion of guarantees covering mortgages worth more than £120billion. Just hours after the announcement, Mr Boles spoke at a reception for property industry figures hosted by Savills estate agents in Mayfair. Chancellor George Osborne, pictured on a visit to a building . site in south east London, used his Budget to reveal plans to tear up . more planning rules . Plans: Nick Boles told housebuilding executives he wanted to make it easier for property owners 'to do some things without having to ask for permission' He revealed that planning laws will be . liberalised within weeks to allow them to begin a house-building boom . backed by the Budget. The minister said the planning . permission requirement for many developments was to be axed, and he was . prepared for an acrimonious battle with countryside campaigners. He said: 'Property owners should be . able to do some things without asking anyone. That's what property . rights mean. We want to expand the number of things you can do without . having to ask for planning permission.' And he suggested that farm buildings and shops could be turned into homes without change of use being officially granted.","Nick Boles wants owners to be able to improve homes without permission .

Zero tolerance security guard Darien Long has lost his job after posting online videos showing his tough stance with troublemakers at the mall where he works. Mr Long, who made headlines last month after a video showing him tasering a violent woman outside Atlanta's Metro Mall was posted online – has told how he will be out of a job on April 1. He blamed a host of factors including 'the police', a recent raid at the mall, and the publicity surrounding his no-nonsense approach to his job for him being asked to leave at the end of this month. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Darien Long said the publicity surrounding his zero-tolerance approach is to blame for him losing his job . Asked why he was losing his job, Mr Long said: 'I think it's the result of a lot of things; the police, the raid that just recently happened... the publicity. 'It's not just one thing, it's all the things.' Meanwhile it was reported today that Mr Long was arrested after he allegedly ran up to a man in the Metro Mall and tackled him to the floor. Yesterday's alleged arrest reportedly came after Mr Long said he had warned the man not to return to the mall but could not prove that he had. Mr Long became an internet sensation worldwide after videos appeared showing him tasering people he decided were troublemakers at the Atlanta mall. One video showed him tasering a woman to . the ground in front of a small child after she shouted abuse, pushed . him, and threatened to 'beat' him. One video shows this woman being tasered after she became abusive to Mr Long at the Atlanta mall . In another, he is shown using a taser . on a man named Marcus Purnell after he refused to leave the mall and . became abusive, telling the guard 'You better watch your back.' Mr . Long has defended his work, saying a tough stance is needed in the . downtown neighborhood where he works, where the mall is popular spot for . drug-dealers, vagrants and thieves. Mr Long, who later told the Huffington Post that his dismissal may be because of revenue issues, predicted that the miscreants will flood back into the mall as soon as he leaves his job there. He said: . 'Within two or three days the drug-dealers will start to come back in, . probably the same day, like April 1 once they know I'm not there, . they'll all come back in.' The security guard, who daily faced threats, abuse and violence in his job, says he may have trouble finding work in the same field and was not sure what he would do next. Tasered: The woman lies on the ground in front of the child she was with after the confrontation with Mr Long . He wore body armor with a video camera strapped onto his chest, and put clips of the aggression he encountered up on the net. After he posted films showing the above encounters, and others similar online, supporters praising his tough approach donated more than . $20,000 in an online campaign. Well-wishers who gave money posted messages on Reddit including: ‘Whatever they pay this guy, it's . not enough’, ‘Guy looks like a family man, looks like he is risking a . lot’ and ‘remind anyone of a sheriff in a wild west movie. One Youtube viewer simply wrote: ‘Why do those naggers keep nagging him? Darien Long predicts that the mall will be flooded with troublemakers as soon as he leaves his job . Reddit editor Ryu Kenya said they started the campaign because Long is a ‘nice guy’. ‘He is a nice guy and that area is very dangerous,' he wrote on the website. 'There is a cop . station around the block but people still sell drugs around there. 'He . has to wear kevlar and has his own mugshot book. He was not too proud . about tasing the woman and wished it could have been avoided.’ And since then more and more videos are emerging of the zero-tolerance guard refusing to give in to violent threats. In the footage, filmed by a camera on Long’s uniform, men are heard warning they’ll follow him home; he is racially abused; spat at; threatened with violence and objects are thrown at him all because he’s asked people to leave the shopping center or to stop hovering outside.

For many fathers, the prospect of telling their sons about the meaning of life induces apprehension. But when Francis Crick shared the secret of life with his 12-year-old son Michael, it was a hugely exciting moment. After all, he had just  discovered it. A letter from the famed British  scientist to his son has come to light in which he describes his groundbreaking model of DNA weeks before it was made public. A letter by the famed British scientist Francis Crick (pictured) to his son Michael (pictured) in which he reveals for the first time the . discovery of DNA, has come to light . In the handwritten letter, tipped to . sell for £1.5million, the biologist writes of having made 'a most . important  discovery' at a research lab in Cambridge. He would go on to win a Nobel Prize for his work, which revolutionised our understanding of genetics. In the letter, Dr Crick explains in depth the DNA double helix structure, the so-called 'blueprint for life'. He says: 'We have built a model for . the structure of des-oxy-ribose-nucleic-acid, called DNA for . short . . . In other words we think we have found the basic copying . mechanism by which life comes from life.' Dr Crick also drew a rudimentary diagram, telling Michael: 'Read this carefully so you understand it.' He signed the letter, dated March 19, 1953, 'lots of love, Daddy'. Dr Crick, who was from Northampton but emigrated to California, died in 2004 aged 88. A letter by famed British scientist Francis Crick to his 12-year-old son in which he reveals for the first time the discovery of DNA. The handwritten letter is tipped to sell at auction for £1.5 million . In the letter he explains in-depth the make-up and code of the DNA helix structure or the so-called blueprint to life. And he instructed Michael to carefully study the DNA structure so that he 'understood' it. Michael Crick, now 72 and living in . Seattle, kept the letter, and will sell it at auction in New York to . mark 60 years since the discovery. He said: 'My father believed that DNA . contained some sort of code so he got interested in codes and he shared . his enthusiasm with me. 'Everything came together in February . 1953 when my father and (fellow scientist) Jim Watson were given the . go-ahead to try and construct a model of DNA. Michael Crick - computer game pioneer and son of DNA scientist Francis Crick . 'My father's enthusiasm could not be . contained. The story is told of him sweeping excitedly into a local pub . called the Eagle and announcing to all who would listen that he had . found “the secret of life”. Then on March 19 my father wrote to me . describing the model and its implications. I was 12 at the time and away . at Bedales – the British boarding school. 'When I returned to Cambridge my father very proudly showed me the model. 'The excitement of the event was . beautifully captured for the first time in this perfect letter . summarising the discovery in seven simple pages.' Mr Crick said part of the proceeds . from the sale will go to an institute dedicated to brain research, . another area in which his father worked. Dr Crick carried out his research on  DNA with fellow scientists James Watson and Maurice Wilkins. The three won the Nobel Prize for physiology and medicine in 1962. Attempting to put his work in simple . terms, Dr Crick wrote to his son that DNA could be thought of as a 'very . long chain with flat bits sticking out, called the “bases”'. He said: . 'We have two of these chains winding round each other – each one is a . helix – and the chain, made up of sugar and phosphorus, is on the . outside and the bases are all on the inside. 'Now the exciting thing is that while there are four different bases we find we can only put certain pairs of them together.' The auction is being held by  Christie's in New York on April 10. DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a giant molecule containing the coded instructions of life. Two Cambridge scientists, James Watson and Francis Crick, first described its famous double-helix structure in 1953, changing the face of biology for ever. The complete set of DNA instructions that makes us what we are is known as the Human Genome. Within it, there are 2.9 billion chemical ""letters"". Certain sequences of these letters make up the genes, the ""software"" that tells cellular machinery how to make all the proteins in the body. Working out the entire pattern of DNA in the human genome is a technical achievement that has been compared with landing men on the moon. A DNA molecule consists of two strands that wrap around each other to resemble a twisted ladder. The sides of the ladder, made of sugar and phosphate molecules, are connected by rungs of chemicals called nucleotide bases. Four different bases are present in DNA, and it is these that make up the letters in the genetic code. They are adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C) and guanine (G). The two DNA strands are held together by weak bonds between bases attached to each strand, forming base pairs. Genome size is usually defined as the total number of base pairs. In the case of the human genome, the figure is 2.9 billion.","He wrote 'We think we have found the basic copying mechanism by which life comes from life'

The home of the Trotter family from the comedy classic Only Fools and Horses has been lovingly replicated for the exhibition. Scroll down for video . Lovely jubbly: Del Boy and Rodney Trotter's famous Peckham council flat from TV's Only Fools and Horses has been given a facelift .

The Peckham palace redesign sits beside an identically-sized property aimed at showing how a modern council flat can be transformed into a 'multi-purpose living space'. Architect and TV presenter George Clarke proved he was no plonker as he came up with the space-saving ideas. The TV replica flat has been furnished with only the finest of 1980s interior design; from faux fur animal print rugs (complete with the creature's head), to the epitome of home-entertaining - a mini-bar. Chairs surround a glass-topped table, which is nestled alongside the palm-tree printed wallpaper, which has sadly been concealed by a wall dresser.

The Institute for Fiscal Studies warned the next government will have to find the money in the two years after the election if it is to get public finances back on track. If ministers keep cutting spending at the current rate, £9billion of tax rises would be necessary in 2016/17 – the equivalent of an increase of 3p on the basic rate of income tax. Scroll down for video . The Institute for Fiscal Studies warned George Osborne's plans require up to £12.3billion to be found, equivalent to a £480 tax hike for every household . Tale of two leaders: David Cameron looks to heaven for inspiration while Labour leader Ed Miliband appears downbeat as they attended the enthronement of the Archbishop of Canterbury the day after the budget . The savings will have to be made because of deterioration in the state of the public finances after growth predictions were slashed in half. But this week’s Budget also slapped £3.5billion of extra costs on government departments who will have to pay higher National Insurance contributions as a result of reforms to pensions. That will raise the likely tax hit to £12.5billion. The Treasury claims the Government would like to make austerity savings using spending cuts alone. But that would mean Whitehall departments enduring unprecedented cuts of 18 per cent by 2017/18. And the Budget ‘Red Book’, which spells out all the Chancellor’s budget measures, actually reveals that officials are already considering tax rises. George Osborne today met Rick Newton and Emily Sandercock who have recently bought an apartment to promote his home buyers schemes . Hard hats on: A day after delivering his Budget, Chancellor George Osborne (left) refused to rule out allowing people buying second homes to benefit from a £130billion government scheme, while Deputy PM Nick Clegg (left) came under fire on LBC 97.3 for the government's family policy hitting stay at home mothers . George Osborne announced the spending review planned for this summer will have to find another £11.5billion in cuts for 2015-16. The . Treasury refused to say where the axe will fall, but the IPPR think . tank said calculated that with £8.5billion coming from departments, if . it was spread evenly the reductions would be: . Nick . Pearce, IPPR Director, said: 'If these cuts go ahead, it means a major . further reductions in spending on housing, further and higher education, . early years and other local government services.' ‘It would, of course, be possible to do more of this further consolidation through tax instead,’ the document says. IFS director, Paul Johnson, said that suggests tax rises are on the cards after the next election, whoever wins in 2015. He said: ‘It seems extremely hard to imagine we will really achieve an additional £23 billion of spending cuts by 2017/18. As the Red Book almost acknowledges, it seems likely there will be some significant tax increases to offset some of those cuts.’ The IFS called the state of the public finances ‘desperately disappointing’, with the Chancellor due to borrow £70billion more in 2014/15 than he had originally hoped. Mr Johnson warned that the poor state of the public finances also means a ‘grim’ future for departments whose budgets will not be protected. The Government has ringfenced spending in the NHS, international aid and schools. Mr Johnson said: ‘Add to that the fact that we are promised more capital spending, more spending on social care and a more generous childcare subsidy, within an overall spending envelope that has not been expanded, and the outlook for all other unprotected spending looks grim indeed.’ The warning came as the Institute for Public Policy Research, a centre left think tank, warned that belt-tightening is set to hit the Armed Forces hard. Chancellor George Osborne today promoted his house bying package on a visit to a Berkeley Homes Royal Arsenal Riverside development in Woolwich, south east London . Chirpy: George Osborne admitted it was yet another tough Budget but said if you look around Europe Britain's economic problems aren't that bad . Nick Clegg was confronted during his LBC 97.3 phone-in which he co-presents with Nick Ferrari . The Coalition’s spending review, which will draw up budgets for 2015/16 over the next few months, looks set to demand cuts of £1.65billion from the Ministry of Defence. Local government also faces a £1.5billion cut, with £930 being slashed from the Department of Business budget, £850million from the non-schools parts of the education budget, £500million from the Home Office and £460million slashed from the Ministry of Justice. That will annoy senior members of the Cabinet – Home Secretary Theresa May, Business Secretary Vince Cable, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles – who have been dubbed the National Union of Ministers for protesting that they can’t make more cuts. New parents Paul Stokes and his wife Carmen (left), who together earn more than £90,000, have welcomed the new child care tax break which they will get while Simon Bower (right) who earns £50,000 believes he and his wife Caroline, a stay at home mother-of-two, have been penalised by losing their child benefit for having 'traditional Tory values' Awkward: George Osborne bumped into his Labour rival Ed Balls outside TV studios in Westminster as they both took to the airwaves to give their take on the Budget . A defiant Mr Osborne said he would make no apology for cutting spending yesterday after he was accused of ‘massaging’ the figures on borrowing to score a political point. The IFS said his manipulation of the borrowing figures could lead to ‘real economic costs’. Labour also seized on revelations that £2.2billion was trimmed from the NHS budget at the last minute –money which could have been spent on frontline care or hiring nurses. A Populus survey for Which? found huge support for many of the flagship policies unveiled in the Budget . Which party do you trust with the economy? George Osborne has declared he is in competition with shadow chancellor Ed Balls over who can get the most followers on Twitter. A day after joining the site, using the Twitter handle @George-Osborne, the Chancellor had racked up 33,400 followers despite sending just three tweets. Balls has sent more than 3,000 tweets and has 77,500 followers. ‘We're in a competition now,’ Mr Osborne told ITV1's Daybreak this morning. Making his debut on Twitter yesterday he was deluged with advice - and abuse. It included missives such as: ‘learn to punctuate correctly you risible t**t’. Another example of taunting was: ‘You’re a first class b*****d, you overpaid, overeducated fox hunting t**t.’ Mr Osborne admitted: 'It's a fast and furious world out there.’ But Mr Osborne rejected the criticism, saying he was proud to have got spending under control. ‘We have been very, very tough and we have reduced spending in order to reduce borrowing,’ he said. ‘So if the charge is, you stepped in to stop government spending too much at the end of the financial year, that’s right.’ The problem arose in February when Mr Osborne was warned by the Office of Budget Responsibility that income tax receipts were £5.1billion lower than expected. That triggered a period of frantic horse-trading in which the Treasury leaned on other departments to underspend their budgets. Figures, never published before, showed that £3billion was also found from the Defence budget and £900million from Transport. Other money was saved by delaying payments to bodies like the World Bank and the European Union. The exercise opened up Mr Osborne to the charge that he has fiddled the figures, using the kind of accounting tricks for which Gordon Brown was once notorious. The IFS was damning about that exercise, effectively accusing ministers of wastefully manipulating spending plans for political ends.

There was a rare piece of good news for the economy yesterday as figures showed a fall in government borrowing, a rise in High Street sales and growing business confidence. It came a day after official growth forecasts for 2013 were slashed in half to 0.6 per cent. The Government borrowed £2.8billion last month – £9billion less than in February last year. Retail sales jumped 2.1 per cent last month, the biggest rise since March last year.

It's a boy: Nancy Gonzalez, who became pregnant with an inmate's baby, has given birth to a son . A prison guard accused of having a sexual relationship with an inmate who killed two New York City policemen has given birth to a son. Nancy Gonzalez's attorney told the New York Daily News his client delivered the baby Thursday night on Long Island. Gonzalez was charged in February with having an unlawful sexual relationship with inmate Ronell Wilson while working at a federal detention center in Brooklyn. At the time her attorney said Gonzalez has had a tragic life and made poor decisions. Wilson was convicted in the point-blank shootings of undercover officers James Nemorin and Rodney Andrews in a 2006 gun sting. He initially was sentenced to death, but his sentence was overturned on appeal. Gonzalez was excused from a court date in New York on Wednesday due to labor contractions, her attorney Anthony Ricco told the court. The former Metropolitan Detention Center guard was charged with having unlawful sex with an inmate and later failed a drugs test, admitting she had taken cocaine to deal with the stress of her arrest. Gonzales is facing 15 years in prison after being arrested on suspicion that she . had hatched a plot with Ronnell Wilson to help save his life. The convicted killer . allegedly impregnated Gonzales to avoid the death penalty and had been so desperate to father a child . that he offered to confess to the murders of two detectives, according to his . former lawyer. Attorney Ephraim Savitt said that in 2006, his then-client . Ronell Wilson was poised to accept a plea deal as part of which he would accept . responsibility for the 2003 slayings of undercover detectives Rodney Andrews . and James Nemorin and be sentenced to a life in prison. Illegal liaison: Gonzalez, left, was arrested after police say she had an illicit affair with convicted cop killer Ronell Wilson, right, and became pregnant with his baby to save him from execution . Explanation: Gonzalez allegedly said in a recorded phone conversation that she was 'vulnerable' when she decided to start a relationship with Wilson in a bid to give him some 'hope' 'Wilson advised me that he would take the life deal - as . long as he could have conjugal visits - because he was determined to leave this . earth with a child of his own, to give his wasted life some meaning,' Savitt . told the New York Post. For Wilson to be . allowed to meet with women behind . bars, he would have had to be sent to a state prison, but his former . attorney . said that the negotiations with the prosecution never went that far . because Attorney general Alberto Gonzalez rejected the proposed . agreement. Gonzalez was arrested on . charges she intentionally had sex with Ronell Wilson while working the . night shift at the Metropolitan Detention Center, which is against the . law. She became pregnant in June, a few months into the affair, . according to court papers. On her Facebook page, Gonzalez posted . a photo last month depicting herself proudly showing off her swollen . pregnant belly in a tight yellow T-shirt with the world 'Love' printed . across the front. Victims: Detectives James Nemorin, left, and Rodney Andrews, right, were gunned down by Wilson during a drug bust gone awry in Staten Island in 2003 . Legal complications: Wilson's death sentence was thrown out after an appeals court found that a prosecutor had vilified the convicted killer . Wilson was found guilty in December . 2006 of shooting detectives James Nemorin, 36, and Rodney Andrews, 34, . in the back of their heads in a car March 10, 2003 in Staten Island. The . following year, he was sentenced to death, making him the first federal . defendant in New York to face capital punishment since 1954. However, . an appeals court reversed the sentence in 2010 claiming than a . prosecutor violated Wilson's constitutional rights by making him out to . be a villain. A new jury must decide his fate. But . replay of the trial's penalty phase has been put off as Wilson's lawyers . seek to convince a judge that he's ineligible for the death penalty . because he is mentally disabled. Military career: Before taking a job as a federal corrections officer, Gonzalez served in the U.S. Army . 'Stressed out': She failed a drugs test at her arrest and said she took cocaine as she was 'stressed' Gonzales was taken into custody at her Long Island home. She could face 15 years in prison if convicted. According . to a complaint, Wilson and Gonzales' scheme to help the convicted . killer escape capital punishment was revealed by prison informants. One inmate said he witnessed the female guard moving away . from Wilson's cell door while he was standing there with his pants down. CBS New York stated that the inmate and guard had sex in a vacant activity room while Gonzalez was supposed to be checking up on prisoners. The two were caught on video talking or hours at her desk in the kitchen. The corrections officer came clean . about her affair with Wilson, which lasted between March and August . 2012, in a taped phone conversation with her boyfriend, who is serving . time in a state prison. 'I can’t explain it. I know what’s to . come. I know what is going to be said about me,' Gonzalez allegedly . said.

Embattled former tennis ace Jennifer Capriati has been slapped with battery and stalking charges stemming from an alleged altercation with her ex-boyfriend on Valentine's Day. Palm Beach County court records show Capriati was issued a summons yesterday to appear before a judge on  April 17 on the two charges. She has not been arrested. Charged: Capriati, 36, allegedly got into an argument with ex-boyfriend Ivan Brannan, a former Florida State University golfer, on February 14 at a Palm Beach gym in Florida . Allegations: Ivan Brannan claims Capriati beat him up at a Florida gym on Valentine's Day . North Palm Beach police said that Capriati's ex-boyfriend, Ivan Brannan, was working out at a gym on February 14 when the 36-year-old Capriati approached him and began yelling at him. Brannan told police that he tried to get away by walking to the men's locker room, but Capriati blocked his path and punched him in the chest. He said that he and Capriati broke up in 2012 and that she has been harrassing and stalking him since. Brannan, 28, also claims that Capriati stalked him and called his workplace more than 100 times in a single day last year. In January 2012, Capriati reportedly showed up at his workplace and banged on the windows, the New York Post reported. Questions: North Palm Beach County police are considering charges of battery and stalking in connection with the incident at Oxygen Health and Fitness gym involving the tennis pro . The tennis pro's lawyer, Steve Sessa, . called the police report is 'one-sided' and the story which was . circulating was an 'over-exaggeration'. Brannan, a former Florida State University golfer, asked the Palm Beach County Circuit Court for a restraining order . against Capriati last year, but the judge declined the request. He . also claims that she sped through a security gate at his condo building in her . Porsche after a guard declined her requests to be let in. Another one of Brannan's exes, however, has come to Capriati's defense, saying that he also tried to blame her for an attack. Christine Corley, who starred on . Gordon Ramsay's MasterChef, offered her support to Capriati via Twitter . on Saturday, saying that Brannan called the police on her to report that she had also stalked and assaulted him. Capriati . allegedly hit 28-year-old Brannan's chest with her fists several times . before a yoga instructor intervened. Brannan then ran into the men's . locker room and called 911. Support: Christine Corley (right) the ex-girlfriend of Ivan Brannan, said that he had previously accused her of assaulting him after he called the police on his more recent ex, tennis pro Jennifer Capriati . Capriati fled the scene in her car but was stopped by police a few miles away. They allowed her to go at the time. Ms Corley, who has a three-year-old son with Brannan, tweeted on Saturday: 'See I'm not crazy! --- this is the father of my child --! HILARIOUS...' The chef told Gossip Extra: 'He is doing to Jennifer Capriati what he did to me... This man is just a master manipulator.' The single mother added that Brannan had accused her of hitting him but that no charges were ever filed. Capriati was only ten when she made her Sports Illustrated debut and. By 13, she was on the cover. She won Olympic gold in 1992 at age 16 and two years later, she was out of the game and into legal trouble when she was cited for shoplifting and arrested for marijuana possession.

It is one of the rarest achievements in golfing, eluding even the best professionals in the game. But amateurs Bob Wood, 75, and Jeff Roberts 60, defied estimated odds of a million-to-one to hit consecutive holes-in-one on the same hole just seconds apart. The pensioners had been competing against two other players in a 'fourball' match when they both 'aced' the par three 17th hole at Queens Park Golf Club, Bournemouth, Dorset. Hole-in-one: Bob Wood (left) and Jeff Roberts immediately after they discovered they had achieved one of the rarest moves in golf . Lucky: The green was raised so the pair did not know how close the balls had gotten to the hole . Ladbrokes say that the chances of hitting the two shots on the same hole are a million-to-one. Bob, a retired property speculator, was first to tee off and struck his ball with a nine wood club towards the flag 157 yards away but because the green is elevated, the pair couldn't see how his ball ended up. Jeff then struck an eight-iron straight at the flag and the pair marched up hill towards the hole after the other two players had hit their shots. Their surprise that only two of the four balls were on or near the green soon turned to astonishment when they looked in the hole and found their two balls sunk in it. The pair slapped each other on the back before finishing and winning their game. They . then adhered to the golfing tradition of buying a round of drinks in . the bar, although their stunning achievement meant they halved the bill. Bob, who has a handicap of 16, said: 'I hit my tee shot first and one of the guys said ""oh, that could be quite close."" Partners in crime: Bob and Jeff were lucky to do it together as traditionally a golfer who scores a hole-in-one must buy the members of the club a round of drinks . 'Jeff went straight after me and the same chap said ""...and that's even closer."" 'One of the guys on the 18th tee which is right next to the green then came into view with his arms waving and shouting it was a hole-in-one but we didn't know which one.' Jeff, a semi-retired roofing contractor, said: 'We walked up to the green and saw two balls on it. I thought my ball had gone over the back because I couldn't see it. 'One of our opponents then walked up to the flag and said there were two balls in the hole. Firm friends: Bob and Jeff were playing a 'fourball' match at Queens Park Golf Club, Bournemouth . 'We were gobsmacked. To get two holes-in-one in consecutive shots on the same hole must be a million-to-one chance.' Jeff, who has a handicap of six, added: 'In amateur golf it is tradition to buy a round of drinks in the clubhouse when you get a hole-in-one and there were 14 of us there, but luckily Bob and I shared the bill.' Another pensioner also managed to beat the odds when he scored two holes-in-one in a row in 2010. Peter Wafford, 75, sunk the pair of par-three holes-in-one during a veterans match at Chigwell Golf Club, in Chigwell, Essex, . His feat also followed that of five-year-old Eleanor Gamble, who became one of the youngest girls in the world to sink a hole-in-one at Cambridge Lakes golf course on April 15 of the same year.","Amateurs Bob Wood, 75, and Jeff Roberts, 60, aced 157-yard par three .

Unless you work for a foreign diplomatic service or you find yourself in a similar predicament to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, it is unlikely you will ever spend a night at one of London’s 115 embassies. But these foreign missions occupy some of the finest residences in the capital. A number are likely to move in the coming years, according to Venetia van Kuffeler of Diplomat magazine, and many of the addresses they occupy will come under private ownership as a result. ‘The majority of London’s embassies are leased from the Duke of Westminster’s Grosvenor Estate,’ says Ms van Kuffeler. Fit for a diplomat: The former Nicaraguan Embassy in West London has been transformed into a three-bedroom family home and is now on the market for £3.5m . ‘Many of these long leases and peppercorn rents were agreed 100 to 120 years ago, and a number of these leases are expiring in coming years. Foreign missions in London may change locations for this reason.’ One person ahead of the trend is designer Jason Yeang, who bought the former Nicaraguan embassy in Gloucester Road, West London, for £1.95 million in 2008 and has now put it on the market for £3.5 million. In the late Nineties, the embassy moved. A lawyer bought the house and lived there until 2008 but did little in terms of renovation. Now Jason has transformed the three-bedroom, Grade II listed house, built in 1826, into a sleek, modern living space which bears little resemblance to its old life as an embassy. Ambassador's reception room: Jason Yeang has transformed the embassy into a sleek, modern home . No time for politics: One of the bedrooms in the Grade II listed property . Welcoming light: The conversion took 13 months and saw the kitchen moved into the basement of the house . ‘It was in a sad state when I bought it,’ says Jason, 41. ‘The skirting boards were in bad  condition and the plasterwork had lost its sharpness.’ Jason, who was born in Singapore and moved to Britain in 1992, lived in the house for two years before beginning the work. ‘I wanted to understand it before I started. As a designer, I’ve found living in a property makes the product better,’ he says. ‘I wanted to know where the sun rose and set and how I could open it up to bring in light. The house has an exact east-west axis running through the length of it and this is what I wanted to exploit. ‘Besides location, light and space are the holy grail of English property and it was vital for me to get these aspects right.’ New lease: Jason Yeang and wife Valerie are selling their 'embassy' Work began in 2011 and took 13 months to complete. The addition of a skylight and a glass wall overlooking the garden, running from the ground floor down to the basement kitchen, made the most dramatic change. This has transformed a traditional four-storey cellular structure into an open-plan  living space, with light flooding in all over the house. Jason also moved the kitchen into the basement and turned the upstairs  dining room into the en-suite master bedroom. To make the most of the natural brightness inside, mirrors have been placed  at strategic positions around  the rooms and Jason has used limestone for some of the walls and flooring, which reflects light. Jason’s quest to find the right  balance between the old and the new has been achieved by restoring the house’s original staircase, timber shutters and the fireplace in the front reception room. Standing on the balcony overlooking the garden, which has also been given a full makeover, is the only place where Jason  can imagine the Nicaraguan ambassador making an appearance in the house. ‘I can picture him enjoying a large cigar out here,’ he jokes. Jason describes himself as ‘nomadic’ and he and his fashion producer wife Valerie, 41, and their children Niki, ten, Justin, seven and Jamie, two, have moved out of the house and now live in Notting Hill. William Hughes-Ward, from Marsh & Parsons, says: ‘The fact that it once housed the Embassy of Nicaragua adds an interesting bit of contemporary history  to this pretty house. It’s unusual to get such a stunning light and modern interior in a property of this type in London. ‘No 8, Gloucester Road is priced at £3.5 million and works out at  £1,750 per square foot, which for  this fabulous location represents fair market value, especially with its wow factor.’ Marsh & Parsons,  South Kensington, 020 7590 0800; marshandparsons.co.uk .","Former Nicaraguan Embassy in West London on the market for £3.5 million .

Police also released a photo of the red car the pair damaged when they crashed as they drove down from their home in Manchester to Devon. They are accused of making the journey in order to carry out their alleged plot.

A detective told the court that no fingerprints from Bradshaw had been found on any of the weapons or exhibits seized. And Det Sgt Martin Sutcliffe - second in charge of the inquiry into the alleged plot to murder and rob the soul diva - told the jury that no text messages relevant to the allegations were sent or received by Bradshaw. The officer also said the same was true of any telephone calls and that nothing could be found that could be attributed to Bradshaw in any diary or handwriting. Bin liners: Bags, maps, gloves and balaclavas were also found in the car . 'Plan': A pair of gloves found in the possession of Bradshaw and Liverpool, who are standing trial accused of plotting to murder the famous singer at her Devon home in June 2011 . Recovered: Police also discovered duct tape after Bradshaw and Liverpool were arrested in June 2011 . Battered: Bradshaw and Liverpool crashed their Fiat Punto while en route to Devon from their home in Manchester . Det Sgt Sutcliffe also agreed under cross examination by Bradshaw's barrister Martin Meeke QC that there was 'no direct evidence that he had researched Joss Stone or printed maps'. Mr Meeke told the jury that Bradshaw had been jailed eleven times in the past for breaching a signing on order telling police where he lived, after he was convicted of exposing himself on the steps of Leeds Town Hall in 2006. The defence lawyer said Bradshaw had also appeared at the Old Bailey after sleeping rough in London, and that the court gave him a hospital order which saw him admitted to the Manchester Royal Infirmary's mental unit. Menacing: A crossbow was discovered in a cupboard at the flat the pair shared in Manchester . Prosecution: The photographs were released today as the Crown concluded its case against Bradshaw and Liverpool - their defence case will begin on Monday . Liverpool refused to give police any handwriting samples and the jury heard there were 77 matches out of 100 fingerprints found on exhibits. 'Disguise': A black balaclava mask found in the defendants' car . The court heard the crossbow and BB gun were found in their flat. Judge Francis Gilbert QC said the crossbow had no string and was 'not in working order'. The jury was told Liverpool had previous convictions for assault and for having bladed articles, or knives, in public places. Exeter Crown Court heard on one occasion in 2007 he had a knife in a holdall along with a ski mask and gloves which were found during a stop and search. He was also given a community sentence in 2010 with a mental health requirement. Ms Stone gave evidence earlier this week and told the jury that the first she knew about the alleged plot to murder her was when the police turned up at her home. The Crown say the motive for the conspiracy may have been robbery. The court heard Liverpool owed £920 in court fines. Bradshaw had no outstanding fines. Local postman Alex Greening told the court he saw two black men from Manchester in narrow country lanes near the singer's home, and claimed one of the man showed him a photo of the singer and asked where she lived. Det Sgt Sutcliffe said yesterday no photo of the singer was recovered. The Crown has completed its case and the defence will begin on Monday. The two men deny conspiracy to murder, rob and cause grievous bodily harm with intent to the internationally acclaimed singer and songwriter. The trial continues.

A former director of the English National Ballet and notoriously demanding choreographer asked his star dancer to consider aborting her unborn child, it has emerged. When prima ballerina Daria Klimentova told Derek Deane OBE she was pregnant he made it clear it was 'an inconvenience', the Czech dancer claims in her autobiography. 'I was happily married and approaching 30, and yet he asked me immediately, ""Are you going to keep it?""' she writes. Shocked: Derek Deane, left, asked Daria Klimentova, seen right with her daughter Sabina at seven weeks, whether it was the 'right time' to have a child . Ms Klimentova, who went on to have a daughter, says she was 'amazed' by the reaction of Mr Deane, himself a former principal dancer and a friend of both Diana, Princess of Wales, and Princess Margaret. At the time of the incident in 2000, the artistic director had been planning to cast rising star Ms Klimentova, now 41, as the lead in the English National Ballet production of Sleeping Beauty, a report in the Daily Telegraph said. 'I suppose that I shouldn't have been so shocked... To him, this child was an inconvenience and he showed it,' writes the ballerina, adding that Mr Deane, now 59, was 'irritated' that she would not be able to perform as planned. Speaking to MailOnline today, Ms Klimentova said she had 'absolutely no regrets' about her decision to have a child at the peak of her dancing career. 'Absolutely not,' she said, adding: 'Maybe I regret that I didn't have another one.' She recalled being nervous upon approaching Mr Deane to tell him her news, but added that the prospect of 'any conversation' with the tough task-master was a source of nerves for dancers in the company. The ballerina said she did not feel any anger towards the choreographer for his reaction to her pregnancy in 2000. 'No I wasn't really angry,' she said. 'I was very happy to be pregnant. 'Nobody put any pressure on me, I came back three months after... it was completely my decision.' Star: Daria Klimentova performing as Odette in an English National Ballet production of Swan Lake . The dancer claims in her book Agony . And Ecstacy: My Life In Dance that she told Mr Deane she still wanted . the role of Aurora, even though she would be four months pregnant at the . time, but that the choreographer opted to cast a different ballerina. Mr . Deane, who was artistic director of the English National Ballet from . 1993 to 2001, and remains a freelance choreographer for the company, has . admitted asking Ms Klimentova whether it was the 'right time' to have a . child, but insists he did not make 'any demand' that she terminate her . pregnancy. He told the . Guardian newspaper he recalled asking her what she really wanted, and . telling her she had to be 'very sure' a baby was what she wanted. But he added: 'There was no way I was making any demand to Daria to terminate her pregnancy'. Ms Klimentova returned to the English National Ballet just a week after having her baby, and was back on stage as prima ballerina three months later. In her book she says she feared she was 'done at ENB' after the incident, but that Mr Deane 'bore no grudge towards me whatsoever'. The ballerina remains principal dancer at the company today. Mr Deane stepped down from his post as the English National Ballet's artistic director in 2001 following allegations he had harassed a male dancer. At the time he declined to comment. He remained with the company on a freelance basis and starred alongside Ms Klimentova in a BBC documentary on the English National Ballet in 2011. An English National Ballet spokesman told MailOnline today that Mr Deane is out of the country and does not wish to make any further comment.","Ballerina says Derek Deane OBE asked: 'are you going to keep it?'

A business professor is on leave from his faculty position after news broke that he’s under investigation for child molestation charges. Shocked: Prof. Kenneth Charles Robinson is charged with molesting a 14-year-old girl and turned himself in for the Thanksgiving incident but denies he touched the girl . Though he denies the charges, Dr. Kenneth Charles Robinson turned himself in to police March 1. The professor was released the next day on a $100,000 bond, but his university somehow did not learn of the charges until this week. In a statement Wednesday, Kennesaw State University officials maintained they’d only recently learned of the charges against the associate professor. The statement also acknowledged the Georgia school learned of the charges through media coverage rather than through, presumably, Robinson himself. ‘An inquiry by an Atlanta media outlet has brought to light criminal charges filed,’ begins the statement on the university’s website. ‘Robinson has been placed on administrative leave from his faculty position, pending further review.’ The allegations stem from a November 23 incident when police were called to the home where Robinson was staying with an unidentified woman and her 14-year-old daughter. According to the police report, an argument earlier that evening ensued between the woman and her daughter, who was upset with her mother for drinking too much that night and not spending time with her. No clue: The Atlanta-area's Kennesaw State University released a statement that acknowledged they learned of the charges from reporters, not from Robinson . After the fight, the girl told police, Robinson entered her room and tried to talk to her about the argument. She said that’s when Robinson began to scratch her back under her shirt and eventually placed his hand under her pants and touched her buttocks. The girl later woke her mother and told her of the incident. Another fight ensued, this time between the woman and Robinson, and police were called. No arrest happened that night and it remains unclear why charges have only this month been made against Robinson. Unclear: No arrest was made when police arrived the night of the alleged incident and it remains unclear why Robinson has only been charged this month . What is clear, however, is that Robinson is maintaining his innocence in the matter. In his version of events, Robinson told police it was the girl who entered his room to talk about her problems with her mother and that he even asked her to leave. Robinson’s attorney, George M. Weaver, maintained his client’s innocence in a statement to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ‘Dr. Robinson strongly denies the charges,’ Weaver said. ‘We expect that he will be fully exonerated.’ Robinson received his Ph.D. from the University of Georgia and teaches in the Kennesaw State University’s management and entrepreneurship program. He stands charged with child molestation and sexual battery of a minor.","Professor Kenneth Charles Robinson turned himself in to police March 1, but maintains his innocence in the November incident .

Digging up to four storeys beneath sprawling mansions to create even more space for cinemas and swimming pools has become something of a trend among London's mega-rich. But the days of plotting enormous basement developments could soon be over for the wealthy residents of Kensington and Chelsea, after the council announced plans to put an end to the creation of so-called 'iceberg homes'. Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich and Daimler-Benz heir Gert-Rudolph 'Muck' Flick are among those who have recently gained permission to add vast underground extensions to their historic mansions, leaving many neighbours up in arms. Extensive: Applications to create vast basement extensions have rocketed in Kensington and Chelsea . The number of planning applications for similar developments - often beneath properties that are centuries old - has rocketed in recent years, soaring from 64 a decade ago to 307 last year. But now the council is cracking down on the controversial practice, introducing new rules that will limit the extent basements can intrude into gardens, and restrict developments to a single storey in most cases. They would prevent future developments of the nature of that underway at Mr Flick's £30million home; a two-storey underground extension incorporating a gym, a 50ft swimming pool, a spa and a cinema. Mr Abramovich's £10million refurb plan also includes a two-storey mega basement beneath his 17th Century mansion. Trend: Roman Abramovich, left, and Gert-Rudolph Flick, right with his wife, have both had plans for basement developments for their mansions in the borough approved . The new rules include an outright ban on basement developments beneath the gardens of listed buildings, or where basements already exist - although the council has said exceptions might be considered in the case of very large sites. The authority has taken action following a study carried out into the impact of basement developments on the built and natural environment in Kensington and Chelsea. Extensive: Daimler heir Mr Flick's plans incorporate a swimming pool, steam room, and separate store rooms for winter and summer clothes . Lavish: Plans submitted to the council by Roman Abramovich reveal the size of the development - the dotted lines indicate the footprint of the building at ground level . Cabinet Member for Planning Policy, Cllr Tim Ahern, said of the draft policies: 'We do not argue for a ban on basement development, only for a better balance between them and the amenity of our other residents.  If the cumulative impact of scores of schemes that take months and years to complete is to damage the wider quality of life in our borough I believe we have a right to take that into account. 'Kensington and Chelsea is an important heritage area with thousands of listed buildings,' Cllr Ahern said. 'Increasingly it’s clear that major basement developments can be structurally very challenging. 'Because of that increased risk to the fabric of our precious heritage assets we believe we should adopt the precautionary principle and reduce the risk by limiting the scale of some of the developments we have been seeing here.' Last year Canadian cable television tycoon David Graham submitted plans for an 'iceberg' basement four storeys deep beneath his Knightsbridge home - a 19th Century schoolhouse. In the summer of 2012 Goldman Sachs banker Christoph Stanger issued an apology to his neighbours in Kensington after work on a basement extension to his £7million Victorian townhouse saw cracks appearing in their homes. Mr Stanger, a managing director who heads Goldman Sachs' German and Austrian financing group, offered to compensate his neighbours for the damage to their properties. A six week public consultation on the council's new guidelines began yesterday.","New planning rules for millionaires' mecca, Kensington and Chelsea .

"By . Steve Nolan . PUBLISHED: . 04:11 EST, 24 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:18 EST, 24 January 2013 . A Russian oligarch who lost a multi-billion pound legal battle with Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich last year is a 'man under financial pressure' according to a top judge as details of a fresh High Court fight with his former partner emerged. Boris Berezovsky had wanted 'total privacy' imposed upon early proceedings of his multi-million pound High Court case involving Elena Gorbunova. But complaints from journalists prompted Mr Justice Mann to yesterday release a written ruling he made during behind-closed-doors proceedings last week. Legal wrangle: Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky, left, wanted details of a High Court battle with Elena Gorbunova, right, kept secret. The pair are pictured during his previous legal fight with Roman Abramovich . The ruling read that Ms Gorbunova - the mother of the couple's two children who sat alongside Mr Berezovsky during much of his legal wrangling with Roman Abramovich - was complaining that she had not received millions she had been promised by her former partner. A freezing order of up to £200million of Mr Berezokovsky's assets was already made last month with Justice Mann asked to discharge that order. But the judge ruled that a freezing order should remain and include proceeds from the sale of property in England and France. He did not disclose a total figure. Mr Berezovsky is expected to 'vigorously contest' his former partner's legal claim. He had originally wanted the proceedings to be removed from court listings which are freely available to the public. Defeat: Mr Berezovsky lost a legal claim against Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich last year . But written representations by journalists argued that there was a danger that people would think that the rich and powerful are allowed privileges if the case was held in private. Mr Justice Mann said in his ruling: 'On the evidence, Mr Berezovsky is a man under financial pressure. 'It is likely he will feel a more pressing need to satisfy creditors than satisfy Ms Gorbunova.' In August 2012, Mr Berezovsky was criticised by the judge who ruled on his battle with Mr Abramovich. Mrs Justice Gloster dismissed a series of claims by Mr Berezovsky - who wanted more than £3billion damages from Abramovich - and the loss left Mr Berezovsky facing legal bills totalling tens of millions of pounds. The judge said Mr Berezovsky had been an 'unimpressive, and inherently unreliable, witness' and had, at times, given evidence which was 'deliberately dishonest' and 'incredible'. He had sued and accused Mr Abramovich of blackmail, breach of trust and breach of contract. He said the billionaire Russian businessman had 'intimidated' him into selling shares in a Russian oil company at a fraction of their value and broken a promise made during a deal relating to a Russian aluminium company. Ms Gorbunova, 45, had testified in Mr Berezovsky's favour in that case, but her evidence was dismissed by the judge.","Boris Berezovsky is involved in a legal fight with Elena Gorbunova .

With approximately 45 million visitors since it first opened in 2000, it's no wonder the London Eye needs a bit of a spring-clean. Brave cleaners have scaled the 440ft-high attraction to begin the mammoth task of removing traffic film and grime that’s built up over the last 13 years of use. Kärcher - a company specialising in large-scale cleaning projects - says the huge task will take three weeks as only two or three of its 32 pods can be cleaned per night. Similar to a car wash, the specialist rope technicians are using hot water pressure washers to deep clean the structure. Time for a spring clean: Cleaners have began the epic task of removing 13 years worth of traffic film and grime that's built up on the London Eye since it first opened in 2000 . Working through the night: Specialist rope technicians are using professional hot water pressure washers to deep clean the structure during the night . Landmark: Approximately 3.5 million visit the London attraction every year - meaning around 45 million people have taken a ride on the wheel since it first opened . The London Eye has become the capital's most popular tourist attraction in the UK since it first opened on the banks of the River Thames in March 2000. It is 443 ft tall and the wheel has a diameter of 394 ft - making it the tallest Ferris wheel in Europe. Around 3.5 million people pay to ride the Eye annually - meaning approximately 45.5 million have taken a trip on the iconic wheel. The London Eye will be open to the public throughout the clean, as the teams will work through the night to ensure there is no disruption for Londoners. The clean is environmentally friendly and won’t cause any risk to the Thames as Kärcher will use PVC 'pools' to collect all water and residue from the clean and will drain this locally. Kevin Dyer, Head of Technical Operation at the London Eye said: 'This is very exciting for us as it’s the most extensive clean the structure has seen since its opening in 2000, which is a huge project. Making a cleaner view: The cleaners are using high pressure washers similar to those used in a car wash to clean the outside of the pods . Cleaning every nook and cranny: A cleaning technician wipes down the bolts on a pod on the London Eye . 'We are delighted to be working with Kärcher as we’ve seen some of the amazing work they have performed on other world- famous monuments. The London Eye will be ready for summer after its big clean.' Simon Keeping, Managing Director of Kärcher UK said: 'Kärcher is proud to be working with the London Eye and cleaning such an important part of the London skyline. 'This is one of the largest projects we have worked on in Europe and we are ensuring that the clean is as environmentally friendly as possible. 'As the world’s leading cleaning specialists, our products demonstrate power through their ability to tackle the toughest jobs – including one of the tallest monuments in London!' Kärcher has previously cleaned monuments across the world - including Mount Rushmore and Christ the Redeemer - and the London Eye is the latest in their worldwide project. Time consuming: The cleaning project will take around three weeks to complete as only two or three pods can be cleaned a night .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 16:40 EST, 22 March 2013 . David Viens, 49, gave a rambling, 45-minute speech during Friday's sentencing in Los Angeles, saying the story he told police about boiling his wife Dawn’s remains was a lie. ‘I loved my wife. I didn’t cook my wife,’ Viens told the judge in a failed bid to get a new trial. Day of reckoning: David Viens, a chef who told police he cooked his wife's body in boiling water, has been sentenced in Los Angeles to 15 years to life in prison for second-degree murder . Last-ditch effort: Viens delivered a rambling 45-minute speech in a failed attempt to get a new trial, telling the court that he loved his wife and did not cook her . Viens said that he did not remember making the confessions, including one that took place after he underwent 12 hours of surgery following his plunge, which he said was accidental. The convicted killer also said that his former attorney should have presented more evidence about his medical condition and allowed him to testify. In her impact statement Friday, Dawn's sister, Dayna Papin, said that having her sibling’s killer sentenced to 15 years to live will not bring her closure, The Press-Telegram reported. 'As I sat here the last hour listening, I learned I will not have any peace for a very long time,' Papin said. 'I think he's made it pretty clear to all of us he is going to continue to fight for his freedom.' In response, Viens said: 'Nobody loved Dawn Marie Viens more than I did, or misses her more. I lied to police out of fear. My life's been a mess ever since. I'm sorry Dayna.' The 49-year-old man was convicted in September of killing 39-year-old Dawn Viens in 2009. Her body was never found. In a recorded interrogation presented at trial, Viens said he cooked her body for four days to get rid of evidence. Authorities said he leaped off a cliff after learning he was a suspect in her disappearance. The man survived the fall, but sustained serious injuries that landed him in a wheelchair. In a sentencing memo cited by the Los Angeles Times, prosecutors called the former chef 'A liar and a manipulator,' adding that he had a history of drug-related crime before the 2009 murder. After being convicted on a drug charge in 2003, Viens fled to Mexico instead of serving a four-month sentence in Vermont, according to court documents. He eventually gave himself up, only to be found guilty of a federal marijuana charge two years later. On his own: Chef David Viens, pictured right, fired his lawyer Fred McCurry (left) in a Los Angeles court today as he awaits sentencing for the murder of his wife in 2009 . Viens was convicted of . second-degree murder in September. He had confessed to accidentally killing her and then . cooking her body for four days in an effort to cover up his crime. Following his conviction, Viens told . his lawyer that his services were no longer required and that he would . represent himself at his sentencing. The convicted killer, who had pleaded . not guilty, tried to get rid of his attorney earlier in the trial but . Judge Rand S. Rubin refused to allow the dismissal. During the trial, those who knew the . Vienses testified that their marriage had been in trouble, with Dawn . telling one of her friends her husband had choked her and David telling . another friend he wanted to 'kill that bitch' because he suspected her . of stealing $300 from the restaurant. Following Dawn Viens' disappearance, . her husband told people that his wife had left him. In an attempt to . conceal the truth, prosecutors said the chef sent fake text messages . from his dead wife's phone to her friends. But the victim’s sister was not convinced and filed a missing persons report in November 2009. In February 2011, when Mr Viens . learned that he has become a suspect in his wife's disappearance, he . attempted to end his life by leaping off a cliff. During an interrogation, Viens told . police how on the day of the killing, which took place in mid-October . 2009, he duct-taped his wife's mouth, hands and feet like he had done . twice before in order to stop her from 'driving around wasted, whacked . out on coke and drinking.' Then the husband dozed off. When he woke up hours later, Vines panicked because Dawn was dead. According to his former attorney, . Viens thought that no one would believe him that the death was . accidental, and so the professional cook packed his wife's body into a . Dumpster at his restaurant. But during a second interrogation, . the chef offered a much more gruesome version of events, detailing how . he got rid of his wife's 105-pound body. 'He treated her like a piece of meat': The couple's friend Karen Patterson told reporters justice had been done when Viens was convicted in September . ‘I cooked her four days, I let her cool, I strained it out,’ he said. The rest of Dawn’s remains were . dumped in the trash. Though Viens told authorities that he hid his . wife’s skull in his mother’s attic, he added that he was ‘confused … . because of these dreams and stuff I’ve had.’ In August 2010, homicide detectives . took over the investigation after finding blood splatter inside Dawn and . David Viens' former home. Viens was critically injured when he leaped from a 80-ft cliff in March 2011 near Rancho Palos Verdes as police closed in on him for the crime. A juror said after the verdict in . September that it was that apparent suicide attempt which convinced him . of Viens' guilt, adding: 'My opinion was if he was innocent, he wouldn't . jump off a cliff.' During the trial, prosecutors . relied on gruesome interrogation tapes in which . Viens described how he shoved Dawn's body in a 55-gallon drum of boiling . water and cooked it until little but her skull was left. The chef said in the recordings that he mixed what remained of his . wife after she was boiled up with other waste and then dumped some of it . in a grease pit at his restaurant and put the rest in the trash. He said he stashed his wife's skull in his mother's attic in Torrance, California. 'For some reason I just got violent': David Viens pleaded not guilty to the murder of his wife Dawn . Body search: Police excavated the Thyme Contemporary Cafe but found no trace of Dawn Viens . His then-defense attorney Fred . McCurry said the evidence didn't support a first-degree murder . conviction against his client, which requires proof of premeditation. A search of Viens' mother's house turned up nothing, nor did an excavation of his . restaurant Thyme Contemporary Cafe in Lomita, Los Angeles. On . the recording played in court, sheriff's Sgt. Richard Garcia asked . Viens what happened on October 18, 2009, the night his wife disappeared. 'For some reason I just got violent,' said Viens. Viens originally claimed his wife ran away to the . mountains from their restaurant after an argument over . whether she should go for drug rehabilitation. But . authorities were suspicious because of ‘inconsistent statements’ he . gave and the fact she left behind her wallet, mobile phone and other . personal belongings. His new girlfriend, 23-year-old waitress Kathy Galvan, then . took over Mrs Viens’s job and moved into her home, before he was seen . throwing out his wife’s belongings into a dustbin behind his restaurant, . police said.

The Daily Mail in association with This Morning and Lloyds Pharmacy is asking you to nominate special people in the healthcare sector who’ve made a real difference to your life, or to a loved one. Five finalists will each receive an all-expenses paid VIP trip to London, staying at a five-star hotel and attending our Gala Dinner where the finalist chosen as Health Hero of the Year will win a luxury break worth up to £5,000. To make a nomination, fill in the coupon below. Here, ANGELA EPSTEIN tells one nominee’s story... Samantha Wisnevitz believes the word 'hero' isn't an adequate accolade for the doctor she feels gave her back her life. 'He was almost warrior-like,' she says. 'He didn't pity me as some hopeless case. He made it clear he was taking my cancer on.' And take it on he did. Three years later, thanks to the tireless compassion of Professor Justin Stebbing, from the London Oncology Clinic, Samantha is still alive. His determination, kindness and refusal to be cowed by the cancer Samantha had been told would kill her, has earned Professor Stebbing a nomination for the Daily Mail Health Hero award. Samantha Wisnevitz with Dr Justin Stebbing - for whom she has voted in the Daily Mail Health Hero awards - at his Harley Street practice . The pair met in August 2010. Samantha, a lawyer for an investment bank, had been busy preparing for her wedding day in two months' time.But then a routine check-up brought all her plans to a terrible halt. Samantha was told the breast cancer she thought she'd beaten three years earlier had not only returned, but had now spread to her liver and bones. 'The consultant said I probably had less than two years left to live,' says the 33-year-old from London. 'I was shocked. One minute I was planning my life, the next I was facing the prospect of dying. 'I felt like in the doctors' eyes I was a lost cause. My fiance, Jason, was with me and afterwards we just clung to each other.' Fast forward three years and Samantha is happily married and continuing to work full-time. Samantha had her right breast removed in 2007 after developing cancer, and was undergoing regular check-ups when her consultant said the disease was back. 'The timing was awful,' she says. 'The oncologist I usually saw was on holiday. Not only was I going to die, but the person who might be able to buy me a little time through treatment wasn't even there.' Samantha Wisnevitz was given two years to live by doctors when her breast cancer spread to her liver and bones, then she met Professor Justin Stebbing who she believes saved her life . Seeing her so upset, one of the doctors told Samantha about Professor Stebbing, a leading oncologist who had a reputation for 'never giving up', and rang him on her behalf. Half an hour later they were talking on the phone. 'I will never, ever forget that phone call. This calm, reassuring voice said: ""Forget two years. You have years."" 'He made me feel like I was back in control. It was so different from the way I had been spoken to before.' Devastated, Samantha assumed she would have to call her wedding off - how could she get married when she was so seriously ill?

'I was blown away by his determination to give me my life back, he insisted I carry on as normal. It was as if cancer was an irritation that would have to fit round my life' 'What makes him such an outstanding doctor - and human being - is he has always seen me as a real person. Not just doing the job, saving a life, but recognising medicine is about giving the patient the strength to go on. 'I can text him any time about the most trivial things - recently I wanted to know if I could get an eyebrow tattoo since I have lost mine permanently as a result of the chemo. I was worried it might get infected but he came back to me to say there'd be no problem. It wasn't vital but it mattered to me, and when you have cancer, the little things that can boost self-esteem are vital.' When it came to her treatment - a combination of hormonal therapy, chemotherapy and other drugs - he's involved her in every decision, even discussing dosages. Samantha's cancer is, in her words, 'sleeping' - kept under control with Avastin, a drug which aims to suppress the cancer's growth, supplemented once a fortnight by a visit to Professor Stebbing, who administers intravenous treatment with chemotherapy and anti-oestrogen drugs. His determination not to give up hope has helped Cathy Turner, too. The former magazine publisher, 44, from London was diagnosed with advanced colon cancer 12 months ago. She'd undergone surgery to remove a grapefruit-sized tumour but the operation had to be halted because the tumour was wrapped around vital blood vessels, making it too dangerous to remove. Cathy says: 'I was devastated. I expected to wake up from the operation and the cancer would be gone. That's when I thought I'd die. But one of my doctors got in touch with Professor Stebbing and he called that night to say it was going to be fine, that chemo would shrink the tumour. He said in this non-negotiable way: “I can deal with this.” ' Samantha's cancer is, in her words, 'sleeping' - kept under control with Avastin, a drug which aims to suppress the cancer's growth . A few days later doctors tried to put a tube into Cathy's chest for intravenous chemotherapy and burst her lung - it was 9pm on a Saturday and Professor Stebbing was at home but 'came racing to the hospital to reorganise my care and supervise the pain regime I needed,' says Cathy. 'He held my hand and promised me things would be all right. You cannot imagine what a difference this made. I was in pain, terrified, shocked by having failed surgery. This man made me feel I was more than just another patient. I almost felt I was his only patient. 'You can feel horribly alone when you have cancer. When a doctor of his skill and ability holds your hand through the horrible times, it makes you feel you are truly being taken care of.' A single mother with two children - Archie, nine, and Henry, seven - Cathy says Professor Stebbing, a husband and father, has shown special understanding over her anxieties about the future.

There will be five finalists selected by judges for the outstanding difference they’ve made to people’s lives. Each of the finalists will be honoured with an all-expenses paid VIP trip to London, staying in a five-star hotel, and attendance at the Health Hero Awards Gala Dinner. The prize for the Health Hero Of The Year is a luxury break up to the value of £5,000. Cathy says: 'What crushes me most about this damned disease is I am a mother. Professor Stebbing knows I need to be here for my children and he often refers to my boys when he encourages me about the future. 'I listen to him and I trust him. Brilliant consultants may be able to perform extraordinary feats of medicine, but I've never met one who was also such a rare human being.' Hilary Craft, 55, a businesswoman from Manchester, first saw Professor Stebbing in 2010 when it was discovered her breast cancer had spread to her liver. She assumed she was 'finished'. Professor Stebbing took a different view, telling her: 'We're going to attack this.' Three years later, Hilary is not only still working but has set up a charity, Action Against Cancer, with Professor Stebbing, to help fund his research at Imperial College and Hammersmith Hospital into cures for the disease. Recently his team discovered a cancer-causing gene related to breast, gastrointestinal, lung and brain tumours. 'What I do is more than a job, it's my purpose in life,' says Professor Stebbing, 42. 'My patients are human beings. I want them to live and feel control.' The treatment is a mixture of the new, the tried and tested and the groundbreaking. It is the tailor-made mix Professor Stebbing puzzles and labours over - which may explain his refusal to accept the prognoses of other doctors. 'But I understand not all of them will make it. If this happens, I find it very touching when a family come to me and say they are grateful for the care I gave their loved one despite the outcome.' His ambition is simple: 'I want to make cancer feel more like a long-term disease, similar to diabetes, in that if you're not cured from it then at least you can live with it.' For Samantha, it's this that makes Professor Stebbing a real health hero. 'I haven't thought about death since I met him. All I think about now is life.'","Samantha Wisnevitz believes Professor Justin Stebbing saved her life .

Uplifting music can boost mental alertness and concentration, according to researchers who studied the effect of Vivaldi's The Four Seasons. A group of 14 young volunteers listened to the concertos while performing a challenging mental task. At the same time, scientists measured the electrical activity of their brains. Results showed that participants carried out the task faster and more accurately while listening to the uplifting strains of the Spring concerto. Uplifting music can boost mental alertness and concentration, according to researchers who studied the effect of Vivaldi's The Four Seasons . They slowed down during the more sombre Autumn passage. Psychologist Dr Leigh Riby, from the University of Northumbria, said: 'The Spring movement enhanced overall activity within the brain but had an exaggerated effect on the area of the brain that's important for emotional processing. 'It seemed to give rise to particular imagery in the brain and evoke positive, contented feelings which translated into higher levels of cognitive functioning.' The task involved pressing the space bar on a computer keyboard whenever a green square appeared on the screen. Different coloured circles and squares that appeared intermittently had to be ignored. When tested in silence, the volunteers' average response time was 408.1 milliseconds. This fell to 393.8 milliseconds during the Spring concerto, compared with 413.3 milliseconds during the Autumn concerto. Those who listened to the uplifting Spring concerto by Vivaldi (pictured) carried out tasks faster and more accurately than the more sombre Autumn passage . The findings are published in the journal Experimental Psychology. Dr Riby pointed out that the Spring movement had been successfully used in marketing to alter mood and influence behaviour. He added: 'The current study provides evidence that there is an indirect effect of music on cognition that is created by mood, alertness and emotion. 'This experiment shows that cognitive capacity is enhanced when pleasant and arousing stimuli are introduced.' Both pieces were written in major keys, suggesting that major or minor key type makes no difference to the impact of music on mental performance. Music based on a minor key is often associated with sadness, yet the more downbeat Autumn concerto in Vivaldi's The Four Seasons is written in a major key.","Uplifting music can boost mental alertness and concentration, speeding up tasks .

At least five people died and a mosque was burned to the ground after a riot was sparked in Myanmar following a confrontation in a shop. The town of Meikhtila has seen two days of violence, after the clashes were sparked when a Muslim shop owner is believed to have had a group of Buddhist customers beaten up. The two communities have enjoyed a fractious relationship in the country for decades, with 39 people injured and a number of Muslim-owned shops and vehicles set on fire during the latest confrontation. Scroll down for video . Riots: Two residents sit on a railway track as a mosque burns in riot-hit Meikhtila, central Myanmar, where at least five people have died during rioting . Spark: A man stands in front of the burned down mosque. The riots are thought to have been started during an argument between a shop owner and customers . The five fatalities are believed to include a Buddhist monk, two local . Buddhists and two Muslims, according to an employee of Meikhtila . General Hospital, while state television said a woman was also killed. Police established a curfew in the town for the second night as the violence continued. The riots are the worst in the state since clashes in the western state of Rakhine between ethnic Rakhine Buddhists and Muslim Rohingya last year left approximately 200 people dead and more than 100,000 homeless. 'People are going crazy, especially . young people,' said a Meikhtila resident under the condition of anonymity. 'It's hard to stop them. Some Muslims run to the safety camps and some run into the fields near . town.' She said some houses belonging to Muslim residents had been destroyed, including one of her neighbors'. 'We don't dare to leave our home as . burning and riots are going on outside,' she said. 'The biggest mosque . in town burned to the ground today. It had been burning since yesterday, . but no one dared to put out the fire and the rioters wouldn't let . others put it out.' Curfew: The unrest between Buddhists and Muslims has led to a curfew being imposed for two days . International concern: US ambassador Derek Mitchell said he was 'deeply concerned' by the unrest . Win Htein, a Meikhtila member of . parliament from the opposition National League for Democracy, said the death toll was likely to be higher than five. 'I saw three dead bodies myself. And . my people also found some bodies,' he said by phone. 'Even though the . curfew has been imposed since yesterday, the police seem a bit hesitant . to control the rioters as they don't have much experience on handling . riots.' An announcement on state-controlled television said those responsible for inciting the violence would face legal action, as would the gold shop owner. Under the military governments that ruled Myanmar from 1962 until 2011, ethnic and religious unrest was typically covered up tough censorship. But since an elected government took power in 2011 the press has been unshackled, while people have been using the Internet and social media in increasing numbers to discuss ongoing situations. Deaths: Win Htein, a Meikhtila member of parliament from the opposition National League for Democracy, said the death toll was likely to be higher than five . The civilian government of President Thein Sein is constrained from using open force to quell unrest because it needs foreign approval in order to gain aid and investment. The United States, which had been the harshest critic of the previous military regime but now is encouraging the democratic transition, said it is 'monitoring events closely'. 'I am deeply concerned about reports of violence and widespread property damage in Meikhtila Township, Mandalay Region,' US ambassador Derek Mitchell said. 'We extend our deepest condolences to the families of those who lost their lives and property in the violence.' Rakhine Buddhists allege that Rohingya are mostly illegal immigrants from neighboring Bangladesh. The Muslim population of Meikhtila is believed to be mostly of Indian origin, and although religious tensions are longstanding, the incident sparking the violence seemed to be a small and isolated dispute.","39 people also injured in town of Meikhtila during the violent clashes .

The mother of the woman shot dead by Kansas City Chief linebacker Jovan Belcher in December has described the heartbreaking moment she learned her daughter had been killed. Kasandra Perkins, 22, was shot dead by Belcher - her boyfriend and the father of her then three-month-old daughter - in their home before he drove to the Chief's stadium and took his own life. Her mother, Becky Gonzalez, has now spoken out about the pain of losing her daughter and how she is trying her best to battle through her grief to raise her orphaned granddaughter. Scroll down for video . Pain: Becky Gonzalez struggles to contain her emotions as she remembers her daughter, Kasandra Perkins, who was shot dead by her NFL boyfriend Jovan Belcher last December . 'When I received the call, I could . tell in the voice of the person that something was wrong,' Gonzalez told WFAA. 'I asked them are they about to tell . me something bad? And they said, ""yes"".' 'I tried to prepare myself and think . of the worst thing that could happen. The thing that came to my mind was . losing my child, and that's what she said. So my worst nightmare came . true.' She said that the family has been left 'devastated' by Kasandra's death. The young mother was shot nine times in the neck, chest, abdomen, hip, back, leg and hand. 'She was precious to us and a friend to everyone, and it's changed us forever,' Gonzelez, from Arlington, Texas, told WFAA. 'And now we have a little girl to raise.' Tragic: Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Jovan Belcher shot his girlfriend dead before taking his own life . Battle: The couple had a turbulent relationship and were struggling to cope with their baby child . Gonzalez is raising baby Zoey after Belcher's mother, Cheryl Shepard, granted temporary custody to Kasandra's parents days after the tragedy. Shepard, who was at the home when the murder took place and called 911, is now locked in a custody battle with Gonzalez for baby Zoey, who has an estate of $3 million. Gonzalez said her baby granddaughter lessons the pain of losing her child. 'I see my daughter in [Zoey's] eyes, . and that brings me joy, and I know that she's continuing on through her . daughter,' Gonzalez said. Loss: Gonzalez said relatives were devastated by the death and were focusing on bringing up baby Zoey . She added that it was unfathomable to her how Belcher could have left his child without parents if he claimed to love her, but 'obviously he must . have felt he didn't have another choice'. Gonzalez is now hoping that her daughter's story will help reduce domestic violence, and she is supporting a rally against domestic abuse in Dallas this weekend. 'I don't want her death to be in vain,' Gonzalez said. 'She was too important. She needs to have stood for . something, and in a way, it does feel like I’m honoring her this way.' Perkins and Belcher had been arguing before he shot her on December 1, his mother told police. Shepherd had moved . in with the couple two weeks earlier to help care for the baby. She heard Belcher say, 'You won't talk to me that way' and then she heard a . thump and gunshots. Scene: Belcher shot Kasandra at their home, pictured, before driving to the Chiefs' stadium and shooting himself . Shepherd rushed into the bedroom and found Perkins lying on the bathroom floor, she told police. Before fleeing the house, Belcher knelt next to Perkins, apologized and . repeatedly kissed her, his daughter and his mother, Shepherd said. Belcher drove off in his Bentley to the practice facility at Arrowhead . several miles away, where he pulled into the parking lot and saw General Manager Scott Pioli, . the report said. Pioli quoted Belcher as saying, 'I did it, I killed her.' Belcher held a . handgun to his own head. 'I got to go, can't be here, and take care of . my daughter,' Pioli recalled Belcher saying. He had asked to speak with coach Romeo Crennel and linebacker coach Gary Gibbs, the . report said. Crennel told police he pleaded with Belcher to put down the . gun. On the field: Belcher had played in the NFL for three years before the murder and suicide on December 1 . Belcher lowered the gun, but only to load a round into the chamber, . Crennel told police. Seeing a police officer in the distance and hearing . sirens, Belcher knelt behind a mini-van, blessed himself and fired the . gun into his temple, the report said. It is believed that the murder suicide took place after a row about whether or not Belcher was Zoey's father.

Give those Harvard kids an A-plus in another subject: Bracketbusting 101. The school known for producing U.S. presidents, Supreme Court justices and Nobel Prize winners earned its first NCAA tournament victory Thursday night - a 68-62 upset of No. 3 seed New Mexico - and it didn't feel like a fluke. What makes the Cinderella win even more impressive is that the team lost both its co-captains before the season began as a huge cheating scandal swept the Ivy League school. Joy: Harvard's Siyani Chambers #1 and Laurent Rivard #0 celebrate the team's shock win in their first-ever NCAA tournament game . But on Thursday, Wesley Saunders scored 18 points and Laurent Rivard made five 3-pointers to help the 14th-seeded Crimson pull the biggest surprise of March Madness so far.Reaction came quickly, and from various corners. 'America, we are sorry for messing up your brackets and also your financial system and everything else,' tweeted the jokesters at the Harvard Lampoon. And this from Harvard's most famous hoops alum, Jeremy Lin: 'YYYYYEEEEESSSSSSSSS!!! HARVARD winssss!!! hahahahhah i told you,' he tweeted shortly after the victory. Everybody ready for Crimsonsanity? Still, this season's Harvard story is not all about the warm-and-fuzzies. The team lost its two co-captains, Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry, before the season began because of an academic scandal that involved more than 100 students. Representing: Harvard's most famous hoops alum, Jeremy Lin, showed his support for the team on Twitter.'YYYYYEEEEESSSSSSSSS!!! HARVARD winssss!!! hahahahhah i told you,' he tweeted after the win . It was revealed in September that Casey and Curry voluntarily withdrew from the school after being implicated in the plagiarism row. It is believed both men withdrew before they were suspended in order to retain their final year of sporting eligibility in the event they are readmitted to the school. In the previous season, Casey averaged 11.4 points per game while first-choice point guard Curry made a team-high 5.0 assists per match. Harvard investigated allegations that at least 125 undergraduates in Government 1310: Introduction to Congress, a spring 2012 class with an enrollment of 279, cheated by collaborating on answers for a take-home final exam. The students were accused of 'acts of academic dishonesty, ranging from inappropriate collaboration to outright plagiarism.' Harvard announced in February that half of the students investigated have been asked to withdraw from the school. Row: Harvard got their surprise victory despite losing co-captains Kyle Casey (left) and Brandyn Curry (right) following a cheating scandal in 2012 . Next up for Harvard basketball (20-9), a meeting with sixth-seeded Arizona, which beat Belmont 81-64 earlier in the West Region. 'This is the No. 1 moment in my career,' said Harvard senior Christian Webster, who finished with 11 points. 'The thought came to mind that this could be the last game. We showed a lot of toughness, just persevering.' Indeed. The Ivy Leaguers put the clamps down on New Mexico's Tony Snell, holding him to nine points on 4-for-12 shooting after he dominated in the Mountain West Conference tournament. They banged inside with Lobos big men Cameron Bairstow and Alex Kirk, whose 22 points provided New Mexico's only consistent offense. Mostly, they showed none of the jitters that marked their trip to the tournament last year, a 79-70 loss to Vanderbilt in the Crimson's first NCAA appearance since 1946. Rivard went 6 of 7 from 3 in that one - played on New Mexico's home court in The Pit - and was clearly pumped for an encore against the Lobos themselves. He was 5 of 9 this time, with three of them coming in the first half, while Harvard was holding a small lead and, more importantly, answering every surge the Lobos (29-6) could muster. Rivard finished with 17 points. 'I hit my first one, and you know, you hit the shot and then you keep shooting after that, and then I hit another one, so I knew it was going to be a good game after that,' Rivard said. Coach Tommy Amaker called Rivard the best 3-point shooter in Boston this side of former Celtic Ray Allen. Victory: Crimson coach Tommy Amaker (left) said: 'I'm very proud of our guys.' Webster can also shoot the 3. He was more of a role player last year, but jumped to the fore in 2013; he made three 3s and gestured after each one of them, even pointing to his forehead after swishing one from the corner in the first half. Yep, these smart kids really can play. 'We battled a really good basketball team in a tough environment,' Amaker said. 'I'm very proud of our guys.' Amaker outcoached his contemporary, Steve Alford, exacting revenge of sorts for the time Alford's Indiana team beat Amaker and Duke back in the 1987 regional semifinals. 'I've got all the respect in the world for Tommy. He does it the right way,' Alford said. 'His staff was very well prepared. They had a good game plan and they executed it well.' Based on their regular-season and conference tournament victories, the Lobos were a popular pick to head to the Final Four this season. The school even gave Alford a new, 10-year contract Wednesday that called for a $125,000 bonus for a Final Four trip. They'll save the money but feel the pain. The Mountain West Conference, judged one of the top two leagues in college basketball all season, fell to 1-3 so far this week. Meanwhile, the Ivy League moves on for the first time since Cornell made the regional semifinals in 2010. This year's standard-bearer is Harvard - that school we've all heard of, but not usually this time of year. Shock: Harvard shot 52 percent for the game - that's almost 15 percent better than New Mexico's stingy defense normally allows. Steve Moundou-Missi (right) of Harvard is fouled by Alex Kirk (left) of New Mexico in the second half . Amaker, who had plenty of experience in rebuilding projects when he coached a Michigan team recovering from NCAA violations, didn't wave the white flag after losing his captains. He simply asked his team for more. In stepped freshman point guard Siyani Chambers, who played like a veteran. He wasn't great against the Lobos, finishing with five points and seven assists, but he kept his team under control, poised and found open players. The Crimson shot 52 percent for the game - that's almost 15 percent better than New Mexico's stingy defense normally allows. New Mexico, meanwhile, shot only 37 percent. 'We can't shoot for them,' Alford said. 'We've had games like that, several games where we haven't shot the ball well. It's a glaring weakness on this basketball team.' It allowed Harvard to take a lead for good with about 6 minutes left. When Kenyatta Smith made an 8-foot, left-handed shot to put the Crimson up 59-53 with 4:40 left, Alford called timeout and Amaker ran onto the court to calm his kids down. They acted like they belonged down the stretch, making five free throws and hanging onto the ball. The buzzer sounded and they stormed the court like any 14 would after beating a 3. But just as quickly, it was over. 'We mentioned to our kids coming into the tournament, we talked about how meaningful this season has been, how they adjusted and adapted and believed,' Amaker said. 'This adds to that.'","No 14 seed Harvard shocks No 3 seed New Mexico in first NCAA appearance .

A grandmother who has been left in agony for more than four years after her dentist removed a tooth without checking her medical records has accepted £50,000 in compensation. Rehana Musa, 72, sued dentist Dr Piotr Pietruszczak after he failed to consult her medical history before pulling out her wisdom tooth in 2008. The procedure has led to years of suffering for Mrs Musa, as the wound left behind failed to heal, despite numerous operations, including having part of her jaw removed. Still in pain: Grandmother Rehana Musa, 72, takes three types of painkillers every day four years after the operation . Before: This was Mrs Musa's x-ray after the operation was first carried out in 2008 . After: Mrs Musa had to have part of her jaw removed (circled in red) following an operation in 2010 . She said: 'It is a horrible, terrible pain which keeps me awake at nights. I can't eat solid foods and it hurts to talk for long. 'I'm on three types of pain killers all the time and I've been told there's no chance of it healing. I have tried to take my own life before now and I'm seeing a psychiatrist. 'My husband and I have lost our retirement. We were meant to be enjoying this part of our lives and it is ruined.' Mrs Musa, who lives with her husband, Afzal, 73, in Normanton, Derbyshire, said the problems started in 2008. She said: 'I started having a problem where I kept catching my cheek between my teeth and it was bleeding a lot. I went to my GP and I was referred to the maxillofacial unit at the Derbyshire Royal Infirmary, as it was then. 'They carried out a biopsy and the results said it was just an ulcer. They stitched it up and it healed. But a doctor there suggested I go to a dentist and have my wisdom tooth removed. 'He said he would write up notes on my medical history and give them to my dentist.' Suffering: Dr Pietruszczak failed to check Mrs Musa's medical history before carrying out the procedure . Mrs Musa booked the procedure with Dr Pietruszczak at the St Thomas Family Dental Centre, in St Thomas Road, Normanton. She said: 'When I went to see Dr Pietruszczak, he asked me if my wisdom tooth was painful. 'I said no but that the people in the maxillofacial unit had sent me to get the tooth removed. He gave me an anaesthetic and pulled out the tooth. He didn't go through the notes beforehand.' In the days after the operation, Mrs Musa said she began to experience severe pain. She said: 'It was keeping me awake all night, my mouth was leaking pus and bleeding. 'I tried everything, every pill and injection and nothing was making a difference.' She said she was referred by her GP once more to the maxillofacial unit. She said: 'They told me that the problem had been caused by medication I was taking for my osteoporosis. 'I had been taking it for three or four years and, because of that, the wisdom tooth wound could never heal. 'The dentist would have known this had he looked at my medical records but he didn't. When I look back on it I did feel slightly uneasy that he didn't take any medical details before removing the tooth. I had expected him to. 'But I just thought he knew what he was doing.' Answers: Mrs Musa's GP told her the medication she had been taking meant the wound from the wisdom tooth would never heal . The St Thomas Road practice Dr Pietruszczak at which worked has since moved to Harrington Street, in Derby, and is part of the Integrated Dental Holdings Group. A spokesman for the group said it did not wish to comment and confirmed Dr Pietruszczak no longer worked for the group. Mrs Musa, who has four children, 17 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren, then decided to take legal action against Dr Pietruszczak, contacting the Dental Law Partnership. Dr Pietruszczak agreed to pay Mrs Musa £50,000 in an out-of-court settlement but she said the money will not solve the problem. She said: 'I have had operations to remove part of my jaw and all sorts of other procedures. But nothing has worked, so I'm on pain killers all the time, which just makes me so sleepy. 'I'll use the money to pay for private treatment in the hope somebody might be able to do something about it but I doubt it. It's just money, it doesn't bring me back happiness in my life.' A spokeswoman for the Royal Derby Hospital said: 'This patient received entirely appropriate care as an outpatient visiting our maxillofacial unit.' Dr Pietruszczak's solicitors were unavailable for comment.","Rehana Musa, 72, sued Dr Piotr Pietruszczak after procedure in 2008 .

One of Britain's top gymnastics coaches is facing jail for sexually abusing six teenage girls over the past 40 years. Bob Bellew has published books on the sport, taught at schools across London and was a former Community Coach of the Year. He also served on committees planning the London Olympics and was the Chief Coach of Tower Hamlets Schools Gymnastics and Dance Display Team. Guilty: Bob Bellew appeared at Snaresbrook Crown Court in London where he admitted groping girls . The 66-year-old was even awarded 'The Order of the Smile,' a UN recognised citation for 'adults distinguished in their love, care and aid of children'. But for decades the respected coach preyed on the girls he was tutoring, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard. He admitted groping the girls, aged from 13 to 15, between September 18, 1970, and December 14, 2010. Some of the assaults took place during trips abroad and during gymnastics classes. Bellew admitted eight of 17 charges against him, involving six victims and stretching back to 1970 at a short hearing at Snaresbrook Crown Court. He confessed to touching and placing his foot under a girl's private parts, rubbing their thighs and prodding and patting their bottoms. Bellew, from New Cross, southeast London, admitted seven counts of indecent assault and one of sexual touching. The charges he denies will be left to lie on file, and he will be sentenced for the eight he has admitted on April 11. He was released on bail on the condition that he does not contact any of the victims. Bellew has published books on gymnastic coaching including the title Gymnastics: A Flying Start in 1993.","Bob Bellew published books of sport and taught in schools across London .

The caption on the picture names the PC, with 'expert scene management' inserted as his middle name. Underneath the photograph, a colleague left a comment which read: 'The picture doesn’t quite capture the snoring'. Greater Manchester Police's professional standards branch is making enquiries into the incident. The slumbering Salford officer can be seen on a black leather sofa, surrounded by sheets of paper and a Primark shopping bag. The name of the officer has not been disclosed due to fears of reprisals. The photograph, which is believed to have been taken several weeks ago, had been seen by 29 people before it was removed from Facebook when GMP were alerted to its presence on the site. The officer’s Facebook page has also since been taken down.

Ian Hanson, chairman of GMP Federation, said: 'Whilst obviously it would not be appropriate to comment on this particular incident as it is under internal investigation, I would make the point that what is portrayed briefly in a picture is not necessarily the full story.' The image has come to light almost exactly one year after a photo was published of two GMP specialist armed officers fooling around with a shotgun on the bonnet of a Land Rover Defender armoured vehicle. Following an inquiry by GMP’s Professional Standards branch, the officers and the weapons instructor who took the image were moved out of the Tactical Firearms Unit and on to other divisions. The internal investigation was launched after the picture was found on a computer during an unrelated raid on another officer’s home.","Picture shows Salford-based police constable slumped on a sofa .

Unmarried singles who have sex in Indonesia could be jailed for up to five years under new laws tabled by the government, it was revealed today. Even couples who live together out of wedlock will not escape the harsh new rules and could be imprisoned for one year if caught in amorous congress. The unusual sex embargo was proposed as part of a raft of new edicts which also includes a ban on witchcraft and black magic which - if proved to have caused 'someone’s illness, death, mental or physical suffering' - will carry a five-year prison term. Sex embargo: Even couples who live together out of wedlock will not escape the harsh new rules and could be imprisoned for one year if caught in amorous congress . The strict regulations were revealed by the country's Justice and Human Rights Ministry director general for legislation Wahiduddin Adams. '[Singles engaging in premarital sex] is liable for up to five years in jail,' he said, adding: 'Our society is not like in the old penal code that allows this.' While Indonesia has long followed a . moderate version of Islam, an emphasis on Muslim practices and . identity with Islamic traditions has gathered pace in recent years. Beliefs . in witchcraft and mysticism are widespread, especially on the main . island of Java. Many Indonesians are generally relaxed about . homosexuality. Jailed: In November last year, Brit Rebecca Blake was sentenced to three months in a Dubai jail for having drunken sex in the back of a taxi . The plans are part of efforts to revise sections of the criminal code still largely based on laws of the former colonial ruler, the Netherlands, and have apparently gained the support of other members of the country's parliament. 'I think, it would be good if this is regulated,' People's Conscience Party MP Syarifuddin Sudding said. Parliamentary speaker Marzuki Alle caused international outrage last year when he proposed a ban on the miniskirt, targetting female . politicians who chose to wear skirts above the knee. Mr . Alle said he was preparing draft rules banning female politicians and . staff members from wearing mini-skirts because 'there have been a lot of . rape cases and other immoral acts recently and this is because women . aren't wearing appropriate clothes'. He added: 'You know what men are like - provocative clothing will make them do things.' But Indonesia is not the only nation with strict laws governing sex.

Raised interest: A story about Batman running on one of the Vatican's main Twitter accounts and the website of its communications office raising concerns it might have been hacked . Batman link: The Twitter link went through to this webpage . 'Admittedly some people might have been thrown off by the headline,' said Vatican communications adviser Greg Burke. The tweet went through to the website of . the Pontifical Council . for Social Communications which was running at story with the headline . 'Holy Switcheroo: Batman has grown bitter, more vengeful with . the years.' Monsignor Paul Tighe, the No. 2 in the Vatican's social communications office, said the office's website, runs stories about communications issues and regularly takes copy from Catholic News Service, the news agency of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. Once a story is posted, he explained, it generates an automatic tweet on the office's Twitter handle (at)pccs_va. 'I thought we had been hacked to be honest,' he said. But further investigation yielded a simpler explanation.

Earlier this week, the Twitter account of a senior Vatican official was hacked. Meanwhile today . Pope Francis called for more dialogue with Islam and offered an . olive branch to China and other countries that don't have diplomatic . relations with the Holy See. Strong words: Francis said it was important to intensify dialogue among different religions 'particularly dialogue with Islam' Vision: The Pope advocated more interaction between different faiths as a means of promoting peace . Delivery: In his first foreign policy address as pope, Francis delivered his remarks in Italian rather than the traditional French . In his first foreign policy address as pope, Francis delivered his remarks in Italian rather than the traditional French - another indication that the Argentine-born pope is less than comfortable speaking languages other than Italian and his mother-tongue Spanish. The occasion was an audience with ambassadors from the 180 countries that have diplomatic relations with the Holy See, in which Francis explained he would work for peace, the poor and to ""build bridges"" between peoples. He noted that even his title ""pontiff"" means bridge-builder. Francis said it was important to intensify dialogue among different religions ""particularly dialogue with Islam"" and to deepen the church's outreach to atheists. Co-operation: The Vatican said that Al-Azhar's chief imam, Sheik Ahmed el-Tayyib, sent a message of congratulations to Francis for his election and hoped for cooperation . Greeting: Pope Francis greets Francesco Maria Greco Italian ambassador today . The Vatican's relations with Islam hit several bumps during Pope Benedict XVI's papacy: He outraged Muslims with a 2006 speech quoting a Byzantine emperor as saying some of the Prophet Muhammad's teachings were 'evil and inhuman.' And in 2011, the pre-eminent institute of Islamic learning in the Sunni Muslim world, Cairo's Al-Azhar institute, froze dialogue with the Vatican to protest Benedict's call for greater protection of Christians in Egypt. However, the Vatican said Friday that Al-Azhar's chief imam, Sheik Ahmed el-Tayyib, sent a message of congratulations to Francis for his election and hoped for cooperation. That's a possible sign of a thaw in relations with the arrival of a pope whose interfaith outreach while archbishop of Buenos Aires has been well-documented. Future: Francis also said he wanted to begin a 'journey' with countries that don't yet have diplomatic relations with the Vatican . Jovial: Pope Francis smiles as he greets foreign diplomats today . Respect: Pope Francis welcomes the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I during a private audience at the Vatican . History: Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew was the first patriarch of Constantinople to attend a papal inauguration since 1054 when the eastern and western halves of Christendom split in the so-called 'Great Schism' Francis also said he wanted to begin a 'journey' with countries that don't yet have diplomatic relations with the Vatican. Benedict had made improving relations with China a priority, given the millions of faithful who belong to China's underground Catholic Church, but tensions remain particularly over the appointment of bishops. China insists on naming them, while the Vatican says only the pope can name bishops. China congratulated Francis for his election but said establishing formal relations would depend on the Vatican cutting diplomatic ties with Taiwan and ceasing activities Beijing considers as interference in its internal affairs - a reference to bishops' appointments. The Holy See also doesn't have diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia. The latest country added to its list of diplomatic recognition was South Sudan, just last month.","A Vatican communications adviser said the story was legitimate .

Polish national Piotr Mikiewicz, 40, saw Roger Buckingham coming out of a property with a laptop computer and a kitchen knife when he investigated the alarm, a jury at the Old Bailey heard. The brave cleaner repeatedly hit the thief with his broom as he tried to stop Buckingham fleeing the affluent semi-detached property in Shepherds Bush, west London. Police inspect the scene after Piotr Mikiewicz was allegedly stabbed in the chest and died . The court heard that the street cleaner had shown a 'laudable sense of civic duty and right and wrong' But Buckingham allegedly stabbed him in the chest with the knife and ran off, leaving Mr Mikiewicz dying on the ground, the court heard. Prosecutor Aftab Jafferjee QC said Mikiewicz had shown a 'laudable sense of civic duty and right and wrong' on August 29 last year which had cost him his life. 'That man, armed only with his dust cart and broom, took on the defendant, striking him in order to apprehend him and prevent him leaving with the fruits of his crime,' he said. 'Eventually the defendant responded by stabbing Mr Mikiewicz through the heart before fleeing. 'It was a terrible and needless waste of the life of a man who provided a service to the local community and did that which we all wish we had done.' Buckingham, 31, of Shepherd's Bush, denies murdering Mikiewicz in the street where the cleaner had been working.

A woman believed to be a relative of Mr Mikiewicz broke down in tears and shielded her eyes as the jury of six men and six women were shown the knife used in the murder. The court heard that Buckingham broke into the house using a crowbar and grabbed a Dell laptop belonging to the son of the owners before leaving as the alarm started sounding. 'In a perfect world, if one hears the alarm from a neighbour has gone off we would raise the alarm or go and call the police,' Mr Jafferjee said. 'But it is a sad fact, especially in London, that people don't go out, thinking 'It must be another false alarm'. 'But in this case, there was one such person, a responsible and public-spirited person who raised the alarm. 'He had a laudable sense of civil duty and right and wrong. 'It was to cost him his life.' The court heard that Buckingham was accosted by Mr Mikiewicz in the driveway of the house. The burglar attempted to get into his car but could not get it to start, the jury was told. Still being harried by the street cleaner, he got out and brandished the knife in an attempt to ward him off, Mr Jafferjee said. It did not work, Mr Jafferjee continued, so he stabbed Mr Mikiewicz and ran off. The court heard that the murder weapon was found abandoned in an Opel Zafira, which had been stolen from a petrol station a few days previously and fitted with false 'cloned' number plates. It had been ticketed by a traffic warden in Bentworth Road, near Buckingham's home where he lived with his father, that morning, the jury was told.

Sudan's president Omar al-Bashir has announced he is to step down in 2015 after almost a quarter of a century in power. In an interview published in several Sudanese newspapers on Wednesday, Omar al-Bashir said the people of Sudan need 'fresh blood and a new impetus to continue their march.' The next presidential election is due in 2015. Al-Bashir seized power in a bloodless 1989 coup that toppled an elected government. Stepping down: Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir seized power in a bloodless coup 23 years ago . In 2010 Sudan held it's first multi-party elections in 24 years. However many leading parties and politicians boycotted the vote claiming it would be rigged. A year later Sudan's southern region became independent with more than 99 per cent of voters opted to secede from the north in a ballot. Last year South Sudan cut off oil exports to the north which led to protests calling for al-Bashir to quit and the cost of food spiralling.

Lord Mandelson has launched a devastating attack on Ed Balls - and admitted that the last Labour Government left behind a wrecked economy. The former Labour Business Secretary ridiculed Gordon Brown’s infamous claim to have abolished boom and bust, joking: ‘Well we abolished boom!’ And, in a thinly-veiled swipe at Mr Balls, he said; ‘We need to explain how we would retool and redevelop our economy. 'We need a politician who will fight on that rather than fight about the past or fight over what is fair and what is not fair. The Labour party has got to offer more than that.’ In a further blow to Ed Miliband, Tony Blair yesterday backed the Coalition’s ‘free schools’ initiative, describing it as ‘a great idea’. The developments threatened to undermine Mr Miliband’s bid today to relaunch Labour as a credible economic force. In a speech in Birmingham the Labour leader will accuse the Coalition of condemning Britain to a ‘lost decade of low growth’. Mr Miliband will attack the Government’s economic strategy saying the country cannot afford ‘more of the same’. But in a speech to a CBI gathering of businessmen in London this week, Lord Mandelson urged the Labour leadership to move on, and start setting out a positive alternative for the economy. ‘The whole argument about whether we’re cutting too far and too fast - it’s in the past. ‘It is rather predictable party political stuff from over the dispatch box, and it is a bit tiring to the public. ‘Everyone knows we are in a heck of a bad way in the economy. Quite a lot more pain is going to be experienced. What we should be saying is, “This is the light at the end of the tunnel. This is where we should be heading.” ‘We need to focus on how to redevelop our economy rather than fight about the past and fight about what’s too far and what’s far enough.’ Attack: Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, pictured, outside the Millbank studios in Westminster yesterday was accused of looking backwards and playing the blame game instead of fighting for the future of British economy . Just bust: The former Business Secretary, right, also took a swipe at ex-Labour leader Gordon Brown, left, saying that the party may have abolished the boom, but not the bust . In a swipe at Mr Brown’s economic record, Lord Mandelson said: ‘I can’t remember who the member of the government was who claimed we abolished boom and bust. Well, we abolished boom.’ Labour’s economic policy under Mr Balls has focused almost entirely on opposition to the Government’s programme of cuts, with the Shadow Chancellor repeatedly calling for higher spending and borrowing. Labour has opposed every cut to the bloated welfare budget and has yet to set out the economic policies on which it will fight the next election. Polls conducted after the Budget this week suggested almost a third of people most trusted the Tories to handle the UK’s economic situation compared to just a quarter for Labour. Changing sides: Former Labour leader and Prime Minister Tony Blair, pictured Wednesday, backed the Government's plan on free schools, something which new party leader Ed Miliband, right,  opposes . The Tories seized on the disarray in Labour’s ranks. Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke said: ‘Even Labour’s former Business Secretary - a man who knows how to win elections - thinks Ed Balls is living in “the past”. ‘Labour have opposed every single saving this Government is making to deal with the deficit, and are simply offering more of the same spending, borrowing and debt that got us into this mess in the first place.’ In a separate intervention, Mr Blair also gave fulsome backing to Michael Gove’s free schools initiative, which Labour has bitterly opposed under Mr Miliband’s leadership. Speaking at a conference in Dubai the former Prime Minister also suggested he was not opposed to greater private sector involvement in state education, but said Britain was ‘not ready’ for a debate on the issue. He also accused the teaching unions of obstructing ‘necessary economic change’.","Former Business Secretary hit out at both Balls and Gordon Brown .

They intend to fund the wedding and holiday from a £6,000 student grant awarded to pay for Ryan’s college joinery course. Louise McHugh lied to bosses so she could meet up with Ryan Esdale pictured here in 2012 . McHugh said: ‘We can’t help how we feel. Ryan makes me happy. I get terrible looks from people when they see Ryan out with me and if they know I’m not his mum. ‘They say looks can kill. Well, if that’s true, I should have died about 100 times.’ McHugh was working at an outdoor pursuits-style residential home for vulnerable youngsters and was a key worker for Ryan when he was placed in her care. The pair got together in June, 2011, and spent their first weekend together having sex at various locations across Scotland, while McHugh lied to bosses about visiting a friend in Wales. The teenager, who has a history of criminal behaviour, had been transferred to the Lanark base of McHugh’s employers – care company Wilderness Experiences –because officials at his previous placement couldn’t control him. McHugh’s superiors were horrified to discover that McHugh had been taking the boy to Glasgow hotels for sex, paying for the rooms on her credit card. She resigned when police interrogated her about the trysts, after the pair also spent a night having sex at a campsite near Aberfoyle, Stirlingshire.

"By . Frances Hardy . PUBLISHED: . 17:39 EST, 22 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:05 EST, 22 March 2013 . Heather Thomson has a rare and cruel amalgam of disabilities. She has a mind that is at once child-like and beset by the problems of old age. Her short-term memory is waning; her ability for cogent thought is declining. She has both learning difficulties and dementia. Yet she is just 34. However, there is one subject on which her clarity of thought is undimmed. Heather knows she loves her basset hound Bumblebee. And the little dog, in turn, adores her. Best friend: Bumblebee, a basset hound with a bionic paw, has formed a close attachment with her owner Heather Thomson who suffers from dementia and learning difficulties . But there is something about the bond between Heather and her dog that transcends the normal ties between owner and pet: it does not seem fanciful to suggest Heather and Bumblebee have a special empathy because they are both disabled. Heather was born with cerebral palsy, and a rare chromosomal abnormality precipitated her decline into senility ten years ago. Her mental deterioration is mirrored by a physical one. She finds it painfully hard to walk. Most of the time she uses a wheelchair. Bumblebee also has difficulties with locomotion. She was born without a foot on her left front leg. The condition, called ectrodactyly, is particularly irksome for bassets, who have very deep chests and stumpy legs. So when, in Christmas 2011, Heather wrote her annual letter to Santa, her thoughts were not for herself, but with her new, three-month-old puppy. Intuitive: Owner Heather Thomson has developed an unshakeable bond with her pet dog, particularly after she rescued Bumblebee from being put down . ‘I wrote, “Dear Santa, I would like a new leg and foot for Bumblebee.” I love her very much and I said, “I’d be sad if she has to go to heaven”,’ she remembers. Santa’s reply? ‘He said he’d do his best, but that he could not promise,’ recalls Heather’s mum Vicky Thomson-Carr. However, small miracles do occur. Ten months later, vet Noel Fitzpatrick carried out ground-breaking surgery on her at his Surrey animal hospital, making her the world’s first bionic dog, with a new shoulder and foot. The surgery, charged at cost, came to £10,000, half of which was paid for with donations to the ‘Bumblebee fund’ that Vicky set up. A fter eight weeks in intensive care, last January Heather and Bumblebee were reunited. It was  a day neither Vicky nor Noel will ever forget. ‘Heather sat on the floor in one of . the consulting rooms,’ remembers Vicky. ‘We could hear the bump, bump of . Bumblebee’s temporary new foot on the floor in the passage, then she . bounded in. She went straight to Heather and licked her nose, and she . was absolutely euphoric.’ Noel, . too, felt vindicated. He’d wrestled with the ethical dilemma of whether . it was right to put a dog through such major surgery. When he saw Heather’s delight, he knew . he’d made the correct decision: ‘When I brought Bumblebee in with her . new foot, Heather laughed out loud. ‘She threw her arms round me, and those moments are what I live for. I got unbelievable happiness from seeing this dog running round, without pain, and Heather’s utter joy.’ Noel’s operation was pioneering and unique. Although joint replacements and prosthetic limbs are relatively commonplace in veterinary science, the surgery on Bumblebee broke new ground because she does not have a false leg strapped on to a stump. Instead, her foot is attached to a permanent metal peg in the bone of her lower leg. ‘Dogs find it difficult to cope with prosthetics,’ explains Noel. ‘They tend to chew them. And bassets find it particularly hard to walk on them.’ Ground-breaking: Heather made sure that Bumblebee had the first operation of its kind in Britain so that Bumblebee could walk about properly . Bumblebee is far more than a pet to Heather. She is her constant companion and her best friend. She has changed her life, irrevocably, for the better. Heather is the eldest of divorcee Vicky’s six children, the youngest of whom is 21. Vicky, 54, has raised Heather as a single mum for 23 years and lives with her in an adapted bungalow in Grundisburgh, near Woodbridge, Suffolk. Once a clerical officer and manager of a dog-training centre, Vicky is now her daughter’s full-time carer. Heather needs help to wash, dress and feed herself. She was, says her mum, a happy young woman until the onset of dementia, when she was 24. ‘One day Heather started talking about events from her childhood, but couldn’t recall what she’d had for breakfast,’ says Vicky. Special wish: Heather had sent a letter to Father Christmas wishing for Bumblebee to have a new foot and her dream came true . Specialists carried out a battery of tests. To compound her learning difficulties — Heather has the mental age of a seven-year-old — it emerged she also had a chromosomal abnormality leading to frontal lobe dementia. The condition led to depression and a disturbing bout of self-harming. ‘Heather ripped out clumps of her hair; her scalp bled. She bruised herself by twisting her skin. She destroyed her fingernails,’ says Vicky. ‘It was heartbreaking to see my sweet-natured daughter sink into this state. She was not engaging with anyone.’ It was at this nadir that Vicky decided to breed a litter of pups from the family’s beloved basset Daisy. Two pups were born: the first, Florence, was robust and energetic and became pet to Vicky’s son Ben, 21. The other was Bumblebee — with her bad foot. ‘I asked our local vet if we should put her to sleep, but he said to take things one week at a time,’ says Vicky. Difficult start: Bumblebee was born without a foot but a local vet made her a bionic one, half of which was paid for by charitable donations to the 'Bumblebee fund' The puppy developed an intuitive bond with Heather. It was as if they sensed each other’s frailties. ‘Bumblebee is quiet and gentle. She knew she should be careful with Heather. They became inseparable,’ says Vicky. ‘She’d lie against Heather’s chest, follow her up to bed. Wherever Heather was, there was Bumblebee.’ Soon, Heather became smiley again. But as Bumblebee grew, the problem with her leg was magnified. Before Christmas 2011, the family went to see vet Noel, 45, owner of Fitzpatrick Referrals, a specialist centre in Eashing, near Godalming, Surrey. ‘He said we had three options: to put Bumblebee to sleep, to have her leg removed, or to see if an operation might be possible when she was more developed.’ Heather, meanwhile, had written to Santa, and Vicky was terrified of losing the pet who’d transformed her. ‘I explained Bumblebee might have to go to heaven if Noel couldn’t fix her. Heather understood, but I knew she’d be utterly distraught.’ Pioneering: The vet who operated on Bumblebee hopes that many more dogs can benefit from the cutting edge new bionic leg . Of course, Heather’s Christmas wish came true and now Noel believes the procedure will be commonplace in the next decade or so. And Heather and Bumblebee are happily getting on with their lives. ‘They have a special empathy,’ says Vicky. ‘When Bumblebee was tiny, Heather saw this helpless little creature and held her so gently. ‘Heather’s eyes used to be so frightened — a symptom of her dementia. Now she looks content. And tests have shown her condition is improving.’ She adds: ‘The changes to her have been quite miraculous. And it’s all thanks to one small dog.’ To donate to the Bumblebee Fund, please make a bank transfer to Bumble Bionic Paw Fund, sort code 30-94-55, account number 58467768.","Owner Heather Thomson has a special empathy with her dog Bumblebee .

It is feared the house where the Bronte sisters were born could be turned into a bistro after Bradford Council failed to buy it before it was sold. Members of the Bronte Birthplace Trust tried to persuade the authority to buy the four-bedroom terrace in Market Street, Thornton, West Yorkshire, so it could be turned into a museum with book shop and cafe. But they have now discovered the house has already been sold. Sold: The house in Market Street in Thornton, West Yorkshire, where the Bronte sisters were born . Steve Stanworth, chairman of the Trust, said members were 'upset and very disappointed' because they had spent months trying to get support for their proposal. He said: 'We were hoping to be pushing on with our fund seeking mission with Heritage Lottery Fund. 'It is indicative of our local council that they see history as something to be ignored and local communities left without libraries, pools, or youth facilities.' Patrick Bronte's children were all born in the house on Market Street and baptised in the Old Bell Chapel, which the villagers have also been painstakingly restoring. Historic: It is feared the house where the Bronte sisters were born could be turned into bistro . Remembered: A plaque can be found on the outside wall of the house where the Brontes were born . Patrick once described his years in . Thornton as 'the happiest in his life', before the family was torn apart . by the premature deaths of its literary prodigies. Councillor Valerie Binney begged the council to snap up the property as a cultural asset. She said: 'I was extremely disappointed with the council's response especially the Tourism and Cultural department, who said they did not want the Bronte birthplace. 'We get lots of tourists from Japan and America and local walkers visiting Thornton to see the house on Market Street where the famous sisters were born and to visit the Old Bell Chapel where Patrick Bronte preached. The Brontes are one of the most important families in English literary history. Sisters Charlotte, Emily and Anne all began to write at an early age at their home in Haworth, West Yorkshire. Their stories started as a game based around brother Patrick Branwell's toy soldiers. Charlotte's Jane Eyre and Emily's Wuthering Heights are regarded as classics of English literature. Anne's The Tenant of Wildfell Hall remains a huge bestseller. Emily and Anne both died of tuberculosis in 1848-9 aged 30 and 29 respectively. Branwell and Charlotte were also killed by the disease. Their deaths added to the heartbreak of clergyman father Patrick Bronte, who had already lost two younger children to tuberculosis and his wife to cancer. 'Patrick said that the five years he spent in Thornton were some of the happiest of his life. 'It is very short-sighted of the council when the Government has just announced a fund for keeping our history alive. 'We could have offered a Bronte Visitor Package tour beginning with the birthplace and the Bell Chapel then up to the Parsonage at Haworth - not just for coach parties but for walkers on the Bronte Way. 'There are a lot of disappointed Thornton residents and associates about this.' But Councillor Andrew Thornton, Bradford Council's executive member for environment, said it was not in a position to buy the house due to Government cuts. He said: 'We explored a number of ways in which we might offer assistance for the Bronte Birthplace Trust to make an offer for the property. 'However, as the council is not in a position to acquire the building for itself, we were not satisfied that this was a justifiable use of public money or a reasonable intervention for us to make in competition with any private individual seeking to purchase the property. 'Government cuts to the council's budget together with a national and local contraction in public grant aid continues to put severe pressure on our existing cultural assets. 'Adding to those pressures with an open ended commitment to an unquantified scheme cannot be justified.' The house, which has a plaque on the outside wall naming the four Bronte children who were born there, already attracts fans of the literary siblings. Literary genius: Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte (left) and Wuthering Heights by Emily (right) are two of the greatest works of nineteenth-century English literature . Family: The Tenant of Wildfell Hall by Anne Bronte (left) is still popular today. Patrick Bronte (right) was parson in Thornton between 1815 and 1820 . It is not clear what the buyer of the Thornton property intends to do with the building but Mr Stanworth said he believes it could eventually be turned into a bistro. 'I understand it's a local businessman and I think he's going to turn it into a bistro. I don't know his full plans at the moment,' he said. But Mr Stanworth is not giving up yet on the Trust's dream. 'We have decided, as a Trust, we are going to carry on with our work and hope that some time in the future it will come on the market. 'We are going to try and get a professional business plan done and raise money to buy it.'","Bronte Birthplace Trust tried to persuade Bradford Council to buy property .

Fallen Cardinal Keith O'Brien was in a 'longstanding physical relationship' with another priest despite his outspoken views on homosexuality, which he had called a 'moral degradation', it was claimed today. The former head of the Catholic Church in Scotland is alleged to have been having an affair for years with one of the four men that eventually forced his resignation. Cardinal O'Brien is said to have confessed to the relationship after the . Vatican was warned about his behaviour towards other priests during the . 1980s. In Rome: Cardinal O'Brien had been due to travel to the Vatican to take part in the papal conclave that chose Francis I, but resigned instead over an alleged sex scandal . This is despite the the Northern Ireland-born priest being outspoken against homosexuality, particularly when David Cameron announced he wanted gay marriage to be made legal, calling it a 'grotesque subversion'. Earlier this month Cardinal O’Brien effectively admitted that allegations that he made homosexual approaches to young trainee priests were true. The 75-year-old had been preparing to help choose the next Pope before he admitted his ‘sexual conduct’ had ‘fallen below the standards expected of me as a priest, archbishop and cardinal’. He said sorry and added that he was retiring from public life. Home: A couple walk past the official residence of former Cardinal Keith O'Brien, where his former lover was alleged to have visited regularly . Three of the four men who complained about Cardinal O’Brien’s behaviour are still priests in the diocese of St Andrews and Edinburgh, where the cardinal was archbishop. O’Brien is being sued by an ex-trainee priest who claims he groped and kissed him. Outspoken: The fallen head of the Catholic church in Scotland had been outspoken against homosexuality and same-sex marriage . The former archbishop will faces a Vatican investigation into his behaviour and could be subjected to further punishment, including police action, if evidence of wrongdoing is found. It is alleged that his former partner, a priest outside Scotland, was due to speak to the press but was warned off by his bishop. According to the Herald in Scotland, the lover had been the Cardinal's long-term boyfriend and had until recently been a frequent visitor to St Benets, O'Brien's official residence in Edinburgh. One senior church figure told the paper: 'There were many questions that others were asking about the relationship'. 'These guys, we now know, were part of an inner circle. In the 30 years since these allegations took place there's been ample time to complain. The Cardinal has had a huge profile for the past decade. But the door wasn't just shut on them, it was bolted in the past 18 months,' another said. 'I believe they wanted to silence O'Brien - as he's about to do another conclave, and make a huge deal of it. As he's retiring, a decision's been taken to go public and take him down,' he claimed. Gay rights groups want him to apologise over his inflammatory remarks over gay marriage. Insiders say that he was 'brought down' by the men because of his comments. The Catholic Church in Scotland told MailOnline: 'A number of complaints about Cardinal O’Brien were passed to the Vatican. 'Whether they were precipitated by his comments on homosexuality isn’t known.' The church in Scotland is now under the temporary leadership of Archbishop of Glasgow Philip Tartaglia.","Keith O'Brien called homosexuality 'moral degradation' while head of church .

The 18-year-old had been travelling at up to twice the 30mph speed limit in his Mercedes and admitted causing death by dangerous driving. Lady Gardner said: ‘He had been noted as playing games with a VW Golf before the accident occurred. He is disqualified now for three years.’ She said changes to improve the safety of newly-qualified drivers had been ‘resisted by too many governments’ and it was ‘time something was done’. Lord Attlee said it was an ‘extreme case but sadly it was not unique’. He said young drivers were prone to 'immaturity and reckless driving'. ‘They can also be easily distracted particularly when driving carrying others,' he said. ‘We are seeking to improve the risk of these very sad accidents and we will continue on the work of the previous government in doing so.’ Victims: The Nissan driver, Kulwant Singh, 32, . left, and his sister, front-seat passenger Ravel Kaur, 37, right, were . both killed in the crash . Independent crossbench peer Baroness Masham of Ilton said the Government should consider ‘probationary plates on young drivers until they are about 21’. Lord Attlee said: ‘Probationary plates are one of the things we are considering, possibly linked with other measures such as not allowing young and new drivers to carry young passengers in order to deal with that sort of problem.’ Career ruined: Meppen-Walters can be seen here playing for the Manchester City youth team . Independent crossbencher the Countess of Mar questioned how it was possible to legislate for the ‘exuberance of youth’. ‘Even if they have a green plate on the back of their car they are going to test the boundaries of law as hard as they can,’ she said. ‘I'm not advocating that they should break the law but we must face facts. We have all been young once and done foolish things.’ But Lord Attlee told her: ‘Experience in Sweden shows that a longer driving supervision can reduce the risk of accidents later on and that is one of the things we are looking at.’ The announcement comes after Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin raised the prospect in November of  banning  young drivers in England and Wales from carrying anyone except family members as passengers. It was one of a range of ideas he was looking at  to road deaths involving newly-qualified motorists. The Transport Department said the introduction of P-Plates’ for probationers was one of the options they were looking at. Convicted: This image was taken after Meppen-Walter had passed his driving test . Roads Minister Stephen Hammond said: . ‘We want to improve the safety of young drivers - that is why we have . made the driving test more realistic by introducing an independent . driving element and have stopped publishing test routes to stop . candidates learning them by rote. ‘As part of the ongoing work to reduce . the risks of accidents involving young drivers, we are considering . several options to ensure that newly qualified drivers are properly . prepared and drive safely. Motorists caught driving while using their mobile phones have blamed 'ranting' ex-wives, over-zealous bosses and even childbirth for their offending behaviour, according to police. One driver also admitted failing to see a red light because he was on the phone and another denied making a call saying he was only using the internet. Surrey Police and Surrey County Council have released details of the excuses given by drivers as part of a campaign targeting the use of mobile phones while behind the wheel. In one case, the driver stopped by police pleaded for help from the officer and said: 'It was my ex-wife harassing me, can you speak to her?' Another motorist blamed work pressures when he said: 'My boss called to see where I was.' A father-to-be explained: 'I answered the phone because my wife is having a baby and I thought she may have gone into labour.' The lure of a smart phone proved too tempting for one motorist, who said: 'I'm not on the phone, I am looking something up on the internet'. While another pleaded: 'I wasn't calling anyone, I was replying to an email.'Another driver admitted: 'I am always using it. It's about time I got caught.' Kay Hammond, Surrey County Council's cabinet member for community safety, said: 'It may be tempting to answer a call or check your Facebook while driving, but it is a huge distraction and the consequences can be devastating. 'You are four times more likely to crash if you use a mobile phone while driving. 'Your reaction times are 50% slower and you are more likely to drift across lanes.' ‘We will continue to work with young . people, the insurance industry, and other key partners in considering . any changes affecting learner drivers and those who have just passed . their test.’ Insurers also back such measures believing peer pressure on young drivers can lead them to take risks. The . Association of British Insurers says drivers aged 17-24 are responsible . for a disproportionately high number of crashes, deaths and claims and . that an 18-year-old is more than three times as likely as a 48-year-old . to be involved in a crash. A third of drivers killed in car accidents are under 25, despite under 25s forming  only one in eight of all car drivers. Mr McLouglin said at the time: ‘When I talk to young people who have recently passed their test, what they say sometimes is that peer pressure is put on them to go fast, to show off. ‘There is a suggestion as to whether you should look at a restriction whether anyone could carry passengers for six or nine months when they have first passed their test. ‘There are suggestions about them only perhaps being allowed to take a family member to drive a car when you are learning, you have to have a qualified driver in the car. So these are all sorts of areas that I think we can look at.’ The Association of British Insurers has  called for an  overhaul in the system - suggesting people should spend a year learning to drive and urging the introduction of a graduated licence for the first six months after passing a test. ABI spokesman Malcolm Tarling  said: ‘Other countries have adopted these measures and their experience has shown that they're largely self-policing. ‘Of course there will always be people who will look to avoid the law, but the reality is if you impose something like this, and encourage people to follow it, international experience has shown that that is exactly what people do.’","Drivers may have to display 'probationary plates' if recently qualified .

The average modern Briton earns almost £25,000, drives a Ford and lives in a detached house worth £279,000 a study revealed yesterday. Research carried out among 2,000 adults also found that half believe they are ‘middle class’, while 48 per cent opted to declare themselves as ‘working class’. And family background was named as the key factor in determining class, along with your job or career and the house you live in. Nothing out of the ordinary: The average Briton lives in a detached house, earns nearly £25,000 and drives a Ford . But while almost two thirds of people think social class is still important in today’s society, just one in three have aspirations to climb the social ladder. A spokesman for 4DVD, which commissioned the study to mark the release of comedy drama Shameless Series 9, said: 'Social class was once massively important in defining who you are, with people doing everything they could to climb up the ladder. 'While social class has less importance in today’s society, it seems that people still clearly define themselves as either working, middle or upper class. 'And it seems the middle-class is made up of Mr and Mrs Average with those who consider themselves to be in the social group earning an average wage, driving an average car and living in an average home. 'But while your family background seems to be the main factor in determining your social class, it seems more material things such as the house you live in or even the car you drive can also have an effect. The average Briton works full-time and earns £24,744 . Has a household income of £43,592 . Drives a Ford, Vauxhall or Toyota and has one car in their household . Lives in a detached home worth £278,714 with three bedrooms . Is married . Holidays in short-haul destinations on a self-catering basis . Has an average of £25,963 in savings or investments . Top ten things that make you middle class1. Genetic/family background . 2. Job/Career . 3. Salary . 4. The house you live in . 5. Money/savings in the bank . 6. Investments . 7. The car you drive . 8. Material objects . 9. Your hobbies/activities . 10. Whether you claim any benefits . 'While Frank Gallagher has found himself a job, judging by these results, it looks like he still has a way to go before he can call himself middle class.' The study also revealed that the average ‘middle class’ Briton holds down a full-time job earning a salary of £24,744. And combined with their partner’s wages they have a household income of around £43,592. ‘Middle class’ Britons also live in a three-bedroom detached home worth an average of £278,714. Researchers also found that those who consider themselves to be middle class own one car per household - most likely to be a Ford, Vauxhall or Toyota. They also holiday in Europe on self-catering package holidays and have an average of £25,963 in savings or tied up in investments. And in their spare time, the middle classes enjoy reading, going for walks in the countryside, shopping, keeping up-to-date with current affairs and going to the cinema. The study also revealed that Britons think genetics and family background has the biggest effect on which class you are in, followed by your job or career. Salary, the type of home you live in and the money or savings you have to your name complete the top five factors that define your class. The car you drive, material possessions and even hobbies also help people also determine whether you are working, middle or upper class. But while 64 per cent think social class is still important in today’s society, just one in twenty said it is important to them to fit into a certain group. And just 35 per cent have an ambition to move up the social ladder, with getting a better paid job the plan for 59 per cent of those. Other ways social climbers hope to move up were named as changing careers altogether, moving house and even marrying into a well-off or influential family. Researchers also found that 90 per cent of people think there are certain stereotypes about the different social classes. And 74 per cent of Brits think that certain aspects of your personality or life can mean you get grouped into a certain social class.","Average Briton also holidays in Europe on .

"By . Martin Robinson and Daniel Martin . PUBLISHED: . 10:42 EST, 20 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:39 EST, 20 March 2013 . Hard-pressed motorists received a scrap of good news today as Chancellor George Osborne axed the fuel duty increase planned for the autumn. The rise would have put 3p on a litre of the already high price of petrol and diesel at the pumps and the Coalition has now scrapped or frozen every scheduled fuel duty rise since 2010. The Treasury says petrol is now 13p lower than it would have been under Labour. Scroll down for video . Relief: Drivers will not have to pay an extra 3p in fuel duty this autumn but many say the Chancellor should have cut prices, not frozen them . Road tax for car drivers is to rise in line with RPI inflation. That will mean an increase of between £5 and £15 for the standard tax-rate of all but the very cleanest cars. Road tax rates for new car buyers will rise in the first year from between £5 and £35 to a maximum £1,065 for the biggest ‘gas guzzlers.’ Drivers will now have 14 days ‘grace’ after the time their car tax is paid before having to display their tax disc. Currently the grace period is five days. The good news for classic car drivers is that cars manufactured before January 1, 1974 will now be exempt  from road tax – extending the current exemption by a year from 1973. Declaring a car ‘off-road’ - and therefore not liable to tax - will in future be done on an ‘indefinite’ basis, rather than having to be renewed each year. This is ‘to reduce tax administration costs.’ A planned reform of Vehicle Excise Duty to coincide with controversial road charging and tolls schemes has been deferred until after the General election. Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: ‘What the Chancellor gave drivers by scrapping the fuel duty rise he is allowing them to keep by not changing VED bands. ‘ BY RAY MASSEY . The move was welcomed by the Tory MP for Harlow, Robert Halfon – . although some motorists’ organisations said the move did not go far . enough. Mr Halfon said: ‘This was a cost of living Budget. It puts fuel in the . tank of the British economy. I'm glad that the Chancellor has listened . again, and helped the millions of car-owners and businesses who are . struggling to fill up their family car. ‘Fuel duty is a toxic tax. It hits the poorest Brits the hardest. We have to keep petrol and diesel prices down.’ Two thirds of the cost of petrol is made . up of tax, either fuel duty or VAT. Tax accounts for more of the cost . of petrol than in any other EU country. Figures from the RAC Foundation show that 800,000 British families now spend one quarter of their income on running a car. Mr Osborne announced last December that he would scrap a planned 3p hike . in fuel duty set for January and postpone a rise set for next month. Geoff Dunning, chief executive of the Road Haulage Association, said the Government should have gone further than merely cancelling planned . future rises – he should have announced a cut in fuel duty. The RHA claims that every rise in fuel duty by 3p cuts 35,000 jobs and growth by 0.1 per cent. On the rise: The graph shows how prices had dropped in the final months of 2012 but have jumped again in January, February and March . Whitewash? The Office of Fair Trading believes sharp rises in fuel prices are caused by increases in tax and not price-fixing by oil companies . Electric company cars will for the first time be taxed under benefit in kind rules. Electric vehicles such as Nissan’s Leaf are currently zero-rated for company car ‘benefit in kind’ rules. But from 2015 there will be a 5 per cent ‘bik’ rate, rising to  7 per cent the following year. It means a top-rate tax payer who currently pays zero tax on  a Nissan Leaf electric company car will pay £569 in 2015. And a 20 per cent basic rate tax payer will pay £284 a year or £24 per month in company car tax. And those who drive the electric plug-in hybrid Toyota Prius (49g/km CO2 levels)  will see their benefit in kind rate more than double by 2016-17 – from 5 per cent to 11 per cent. Ashley Hollinshead, tax partner at  accountancy firm Deloitte said: ’This is a bit of  a kick in the teeth for people who went out in good faith to buy the greenest cars – including electric cars -  but now see the Chancellor tightening the screw. This trend is repeated across the various benefit in kind levels.’ But Nissan, whose second generation electric Leaf rolls off the line at their Sunderland factory next week,  said; ’It could have been worse. At one stage the Treasury were talking about a 15 per cent benefit in kind hike for electric cars.  We’d have preferred to continue with a zero rate, but at least this is not as bad as it might have been.’ The Treasury said: ‘The appropriate percentage of the list price subject to tax for the 0-50 g/km CO2 band will be 5 per cent in 2015-16, and 7 per cent in 2016-17. ‘The appropriate percentage of the list price subject to tax for the 51-75 g/km CO2 band will be 9 per cent in 2015-16 and 11 per cent in 2016-17.’ BY RAY MASSEY . ‘UK road transport operators are the people who actually keep the wheels of the economy moving,’ he said. ‘To them, diesel fuel represents the life blood without which, they are . unable to function. Yet for many hauliers, high levels of fuel duty mean . that diesel is fast becoming a luxury item.’ Pressure group FairFuelUK criticised Mr Osborne’s decision not to go for a fuel duty cut. ‘Scrapping the planned autumn rise may be a welcome signal that the . government is listening, but families will be devastated that fuel duty . isn’t going to be cut,’ said spokesman Quentin Wilson. ‘All the polls say that the country wants a reduction in their petrol . and diesel bills, and actually lowering duty is the only way to offer . that relief and boost UK growth.’ Mr Cameron was tackled on the issue of fuel duty while visiting the Mercedes-Benz plant in Milton Keynes earlier this month. He said: ‘I totally understand that many people have to run a car. It’s not a choice, particularly if you live in rural areas. ‘I understand that people look at the price of petrol and diesel, they . look at the cost of running even an inexpensive family car and it’s . still a very big amount they are paying. 'So we’ve got to do everything we can to help people get on, help people get to work, help people live their lives.’ Mr Osborne's announcement, which had been widely expected, was welcomed by some motoring groups. AA president Edmund King said: 'A . September fuel duty hike would have been the last straw likely to break . UK drivers' budgets and would have led to a summer of discontent. 'The . scrapping is a pragmatic move and will bring some relief at the pumps. Already 76 per cent of AA members are cutting back on journeys, . household expenditure or both, due to the high cost of fuel.' Professor . Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: 'This news . provides breathing space for families being smothered by the soaring . costs of motoring, especially the 800,000 households spending more than a . quarter of their income on operating a vehicle.' Rising costs: The average 5p a litre increase in February added £2.50 to the cost of a typical 50-litre refill this month .","Coalition has scrapped or frozen every scheduled fuel duty rise since 2010 .

Linford 'Linney' House, then 19, was arrested after the disrespectful image was seen on the internet during the early hours of Remembrance Sunday. The controversial photo showed a cigarette lighter with a flame burning the bottom of a British Legion paper poppy, allegedly with the words: 'How about that you squadey [sic] ****s.' From left: Linford 'Linney' House, Nikki Scott, founder of charity Scotty's Little Soldiers; Paula Kitching from the Royal British Legion; ex-serviceman Mark Horton and Garrison Sergeant Major John Garrity .

Among those in attendance was Nikki . Scott, founder of Scotty's Little Soldiers, whose husband was killed during a . tour of duty in Afghanistan.

Contrite: Speaking at the restorative justice meeting, Linford House, now 20, said he was 'deeply sorry' for what he did . The student, who is on a practical environmental studies building course, had to be moved out his home in Aylesham, Kent, after the offensive picture appeared on November 11. Just hours after the picture was published an online hate campaign lead by the English Defence League outed the teenager as 'Linny ""Power"" House.' Among those in attendance was Nikki Scott, founder of Scotty's Little Soldiers, who lost her husband, Corporal Lee Scott (above) during a tour of duty in Afghanistan . EDL members attached his personal contact details to the burning poppy image. They . captioned the photo: 'If anyone wonders why the English Defence League . take to the streets and protest against those who disrespect our . country's way of life and laws.' Naked . pictures from the suspect's social media pages were also posted as a . wave of public anger appeared to mount against him following the . allegations.

His . father, Keith, who plays for Snowdon Colliery Rugby Club, described his . son's actions as stupid and said he could not remember posting the . picture on the internet after a night out. Speaking at the restorative justice meeting, Mr House, now 20, said he was 'deeply sorry' for what he did. He said: 'I think about it everyday and it's always in the back of my mind. I've lost friends over what happened but I didn't want to hide away  I wanted to make things right as much as possible. 'The poppy is a symbol of peace and I shouldn't have done what I did. I'm sorry to everyone that it's offended.' Nikki Scott, whose husband Corporal Lee Scott of The 2nd Royal Tank Regiment was killed in Afghanistan on 10 July 2009, said: 'My family and I learned the hard way about what a poppy means and stands for and when I saw the picture I was hurt, upset and disgusted. 'It was good to see Mr House talk to us and apologise and hopefully he will be able to go someway to making up for some of the offence he caused.'

'It gives victims and others affected the opportunity to understand why it has happened and have a say in how the harm can be repaired. 'Restorative practice has a proven track record of reducing re-offending.

The BBC has signed up Channel 4 star Peter Kay to appear in his first sitcom for the corporation which will air from beginning to end on its iPlayer service before going on to BBC1. The series, about two people who meet through a company car share scheme, will be the first to be shown in its entirety on the service before going on one of the major channels. Car Share, which is also directed by the comedian, is one of the most high profile BBC programmes that has been put online ahead of its traditional TV broadcast. Funny man: Peter Kay will appear in his first BBC sitcom. British comedian Peter Kay Pictured performing during the Diamond Jubilee concert in front of Buckingham Palace . Phoenix Nights: Peter Kay has created some of the funniest comedy characters on television, such as Brian Potter (pictured) The move is seen as significant as there has been talk that in the future many people will watch TV through their computers and that so-called ‘linear’ channels will die out as people choose to when to watch programmes. Today’s announcement comes after the BBC Trust last month approved plans for a trial of up to 12 months to allow up to 40 hours of programming ‘across a range of genres’ to be shown online before going on normal channels. The six part series, filmed in the north west, stars Mr Kay alongside Sian Gibson. They play John and Kayleigh who have been put together in a car share scheme for their jobs at an out of town supermarket. Each journey ‘brings fresh insight’ into their lives and follows the ‘twists and turns in their unlikely relationship’. Mr Kay has in recent years has predominantly associated with Channel 4 with shows such as That Peter Kay Thing in 2000, Phoenix Nights and its spin-off, Max & Paddy’s Road To Nowhere. Digital: BBC1 controller Danny Cohen said that the launch of the show online is 'exciting' The BBC said the programme was part of its strategy to ‘showcase’ a wider ‘breadth and range’ of TV content on BBC iPlayer. The BBC has already run a series of BBC3 online comedy pilots on the internet. One of these, Impractical Jokers, was turned into a series for the channel. BBC1 controller Danny Cohen said: ‘It is hugely exciting that Peter Kay is coming to BBC One with his new series - even more so with the innovative plan we have to launch the show online.’ BBC controller of comedy commissioning Shane Allen added: ‘Everyone adores Peter. It’s bold and exciting for him to head in a more naturalistic comedy direction with this project. It will be a nifty new addition to his incredible body of work and the way it is being launched is very canny. Peter Kay said: ‘To be finally working with the BBC on a new comedy is a great opportunity. And the idea of two people car sharing to work each day really appealed to me, as it highlights the comedy in the minutia of the daily trek and allows the spiralling conversations of life to unwind in all of their glory.’","The series will be the first to be shown on iPlayer before television .

Louise Van der Velde insists: ‘I don’t wreck marriages - I SAVE them. I give men the chance to have some fun away from their wives and properly reassess their lives. ‘They have cheated in the first place because they are bored at home and they are going through the motions with their wives. ‘I don’t want anyone to leave their wives for me. I want them to go home and get some fire back in their marriage.' Louise Van der Velde, the widow of a GP who lives with her two children in Camberley, Surrey, insists she has done nothing wrong by having multiple affairs with married men . Louise, 38, caused a storm earlier this year when she admitted that ‘marriage was for mugs’ after writing a book, Decent Proposal, which argued that more couples should embrace open relationships. She provoked further controversy when she branded veteran This Morning agony aunt Denise Robertson an 'old battleaxe' after being challenged on the show about her views. Today Louise reveals how she feels no shame about bedding married men - and blames their wives for the affairs she continues to enjoy with a string of men. She is currently in a relationship with a rich married man she met while promoting her book on TV in Ireland. Louise says she gives men the chance to have some fun away from their wives and properly reassess their lives . Louise provoked controversy when she branded veteran This Morning agony aunt Denise Robertson an 'old battleaxe' after being challenged on the show about her views . Louise said: ‘We met in Dublin when I was asked to appear on a chat show to discuss my views on open relationships. ‘He had been in the audience in the show and he clearly liked what he saw. ‘He had never cheated on his wife before and they have a couple of children. ‘But he said that hearing me talk made him realise that his life was in a rut and he needed a change. ‘He doesn't want to leave his wife - he just wants some excitement in his life. ‘They have cheated in the first place because they are bored at home and they are going through the motions with their wives.' ‘They have been in a pretty stale relationship for a number of years and their whole marriage needs a giant electric shock. ‘I think, in the long-run, I will provide that electric shock.’ Louise was chatted up by the man who is in his 40s after appearing on The Saturday Night Show in Dublin last month. They then went back to her hotel and enjoyed a wild weekend in the Irish capital. Louise, 38, the widow of a GP who lives with her two children in Camberley, Surrey, insists she has done nothing wrong. ‘I'm not to blame for him cheating - he is and so is his wife,’ she said. ‘If there wasn't something wrong in the marriage he wouldn't have cheated in the first place. ‘But he unfortunately he has signed up to this crazy idea we have in the West that you should commit yourself to one partner and have sex with the same person for the next 50 years. ‘Whoever thought that was a good idea?’ She said her lover had two teenage children - and had no intention of leaving his wife. ‘I don't want him to either,’ explained Louise. ‘I am perfectly happy with our little arrangement. ‘We have a lot of fun. We have seen each other a couple of times since I appeared in the show. Louise Van der Velde openly admits she is currently in a relationship with a married man who has two children with his wife . ‘It is very passionate and we both get a buzz out of seeing each other. ‘He admitted that his sex life with his wife had improved since he met me. ‘I think it has taught my lover and his wife that you don't have to settle for second best. That for a marriage to have fun and a bit of spark, you have to work at it. ‘At some point, our affair will fizzle out and I firmly believe that his marriage will be on a firmer footing when I'm gone.’ It's not the first married man Louise has bedded. She had a second long affair with a married surgeon who, like her current lover, had never cheated on his wife before. Louise said: ‘He also made all the running but I was happy to begin a relationship with him. ‘He . had married too young - in his mid 20s - and he was now in his early . forties. He had only had sex with two women in all his life and he . wanted to experience something new. As well as being a relationship councillor Louise is also working as an ambassador for the extra-marital dating site Ashley Madison . ‘He told me that he bitterly regretted settling down so young and wishes that he had waited till his thirties. ‘He was sowing his wild oats in his forties rather than in his late teens and twenties like most people. ‘If he hadn't cheated with me he would have done it with another woman. ‘I simply provided him with an outlet for years of pent up frustration. ‘We had great sex together for several months and had a lot of fun. ‘He didn't tell his wife about the . affair but he insisted that he was a better, more attentive husband as a . result of his infidelity. ‘It made him work harder at his marriage and try to inject a bit of excitement in their lives.’ She had other affairs with married men who were unhappy with their wives but weren't ready to leave the family home. Louise provides relationship counselling to couples in Harley Street, London, and at an exclusive retreat in Spain. Her . aim is to reinvigorate relationships and marriages which have gone . stale by embracing life enhancing techniques such as Tantric sex. Louise is promoting her book 'Decent Proposal: Divine secrets from the pleasure professor' She is also working as an ambassador for the extra-marital dating site Ashley Madison, which has seen a surge in new subscriptions this year. Ashley Madison said a new British member joins every 45 seconds - making it the one of the fastest-growing markets in the world. Britain has the highest divorce rate in Europe - with one in three marriages now ending in splits. The figures have gone down slightly in recent years because many unhappy couples simply cannot afford to divorce in the recession and establish two homes. Louise said: ‘It is true that there are fewer divorces. And that simply means that there are lots of unhappy husbands and wives looking to cheat. ‘An affair doesn't have to mean the end of a marriage. It could actually mean the start of a new period of happiness for a couple who have been taking each other for granted."" A spokesman for the dating site said: ‘The number of 50-plus married women . in the UK joining us has surprised me. The foundation of our business in . Britain is the married woman.’ ‘Women are disappointed by their spouses' lack of effort and they feel especially undervalued when there is a societal expectation of romance.'

Nestle has withdrawn ‘tens of thousands’ of chocolate bars and Easter eggs from sale after people complained of finding plastic in the sweets - just one week before Good Friday.

Seven people in the UK complained of finding plastic, had broken off a mould in the Bulgarian factory where the sweets are made, in their chocolate. Spokesman Odette Forbes said: ‘This is a precautionary measure.'

An end to the ban on hunting with dogs has been called for by Environment Secretary Owen Paterson. Speaking in an interview, he said ‘no-one is more keen than me to see the Hunting Act repealed because I believe in the management of wildlife’. Last year, Mr Paterson, 56, said he was not expecting a vote on the issue in 2013, because it was clear the Government would lose. But speaking to Country Life magazine, he made his views on the controversial matter perfectly clear.Hunting with dogs was outlawed by Labour in 2005. Stance: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has called for the ban on hunting with dogs to be scrapped . But in their 2010 manifesto, the Conservatives promised a free Parliamentary vote on whether to overturn the ban, but many doubt it will happen because of Liberal Democrat opposition. A keen rider, Mr Paterson, the Tory MP for North Shropshire, is seen as the Cabinet’s leading supporter of hunting and other country sports. To the delight of the farming community, he has controversially given the go-ahead for two pilot badger culls later this year, despite widespread opposition from conservationists and wildlife charities. Speaking on the issue, he said: ‘You’re talking to the only MP who had a pet badger as a child, but in October [when the cull was first postponed], the situation was being portrayed as an either-or-vaccine or cull - and I was a bloodthirsty idiot. Hunt: Mr Paterson says the ban should be repealed because he believes in 'the management of wildlife' ‘The vaccine is 10 years away and we’re heading for total costs to the taxpayer of £1billion. We all respect the science, and the best examples of that is how culling has worked in Ireland-where the disease is at an all-time low-New Zealand, Australia and America.’ He has also come out as keen proponent of genetically-modified (GM) crops and argues they should be sold in Europe, despite consumers concerns about ‘Frankenstein foods’. It is understood he has the firm backing of Chancellor George Osborne, who believes GM food could provide opportunities for British farmers. The Environment Secretary says culling has worked in Ireland and other developed countries . But the Mail has highlighted concerns over GM-foods for years - dismissed by Mr Paterson as ‘complete nonsense’ - amid fears that tampering with their genes could damage natural ecosystems or even affect human health. Mr Paterson yesterday vowed to fight to wean farmers off subsidies as part of a massive overhaul of Europe’s costly agriculture policy. After late-night talks in Brussels, Mr Paterson has called for a reduction on EU support in a bid to make the sector more competitive. He said: ‘I’m pressing for further progress towards an open market that makes farmers less dependent on subsidies.’ The full interview appears in this week’s Country Life.","Owen Paterson says he believes ban should be overturned .

A senior hospital doctor who groped a trainee surgeon telling her: 'well that’s what juniors are for isn’t it?' was struck off the medical register in disgrace. Dr Humayun Iqbal, 40, had been conducting a private anatomy lesson when he forced himself upon the woman and attempted to kiss her whilst trying to put his right arm down the inside of her blouse. When the junior colleague protested and told him to get off, Iqbal replied: 'I have to practice for my wife' and later added: ‘'At the end of your rotation you will be begging for it,’' it was said. Later after she moved hospitals Iqbal sent the junior surgeon a text saying: 'A good boss is like a bra - always supportive and never lets you down, a bad boss is like pampers - always stuck to your arse.’' The woman known as Dr B was one of two junior female colleagues molested by Iqbal at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle-upon-Tyne where he was registrar. The other woman known as Miss A was said to have been 'confused and distressed' by Iqbal groping her breast and fielded an entry in her diary saying: 'awful day. Iqbal.' At the General Medical Council in Manchester Iqbal of Ponteland, Newcastle denied wrongdoing but was found guilty of misconduct charges by a fitness to practise panel. Chairman Dr Anthony Morgan told him: 'Whilst the extent of the physical assault was limited, it occurred on each occasion, during a teaching situation with a junior colleague that you both engineered and exploited. 'It was a serious breach of trust, the victim on each occasion being new to the department and considerably junior to you. 'The Panel took full account of your potential talent as a surgeon and it also considered the question of potentially depriving the public of a valuable doctor. 'However in the light of the serious nature and extent of these transgressions, your conduct is fundamentally incompatible with continued medical registration.' The incident involving Dr B occurred in December 2009 in an empty coffee room after she was invited Dr Iqbal for ‘’further teaching.' Mr Peter Atherton counsel for the GMC said: 'He asked Dr B about anatomy and when she answered correctly he put his arms around her as if to give her an encouraging hug. It was a small room nobody else was present. 'Totally inappropriate': The General Medical Council was told at a hearing in Manchester that Iqbal had 'manipulated' his alleged victims by offering to teach them . 'He took it upon himself to suddenly . and tightly embrace her, forcing his mouth onto hers forcing his tongue . into her mouth. While doing that attempting to put his right arm down . the inside of her blouse. 'Following that incident her reaction . was to object and repute him for what had happened but he started to . say totally inappropriate things such as “I have to practice for my . wife” and ""well that’s what juniors are for isn’t it."" 'He also invited her to attend a . course with him in Canada. When she made it clear his advances were not . welcome he said ‘’at the end of your rotation you will be begging for . it'. 'At the end of the shift, she had had . an induction meeting and when he saw her emerging from the meeting, he . was clearly concerned as to whether she had made any complaints about . him, she hadn’t at that early stage.' Dr B moved on from her surgical . training and transferred to another hospital in the North East where she . had a much happier experience but in May 2010 she suddenly received the . offensive text from Iqbal on her mobile. Dr B is said to be still . suffering from shock. The second victim known as Miss A was . a nurse practitioner who had just started training at the same . hospital. Iqbal was said to have lured her to a lecture theatre in . November 2009 under the pre-text of 'demonstrating relevant anatomy’’ only to cup her breast in his hand. Miss A told the hearing: 'He was . drawing pictures of lungs and different incisions, he touched me on the . back first, below my right shoulder blade and moved his hand right . around towards the front. 'He moved his hand from the back to . the front, my right breast. I was just a bit shocked. I don’t know, he . could have drawn it on the diagram. I just moved away and I sat back. 'I just felt very uncomfortable because he touched me. He carried on with the drawings and continued talking about the lungs. 'My heart was racing. I felt like a . lump of jelly. I knew I had gone bright red, blushing and he asked me if . I had allergies. I knew my face was bright red, he touched my left . cheek and I said ‘no’. He was sitting next to me, I didn’t get up, he . just continued teaching. I had concerns but I didn’t know how to get out . of the situation. I didn’t know what to say to be able to get away.' 'I thought when he touched my face, momentarily I thought ‘is he going to kiss me? 'I said I needed to go and pick my . kids up I thought that was a good excuse because I don’t have any . children. The whole time I was trying to think of something I could say . to get away. I couldn’t organise myself to think of something to say.' 'I had just started working there and . I didn’t want to cause any trouble I just wanted to get on with my him. I didn’t have any more teaching and I only saw him on the ward rounds, . he made me a bit more nervous.' Iqbal was reported after Miss A . attended an interview with a consultant the following February and . confessed her spell at the hospital had been 'unhappy' because of her . experience with Iqbal.

Devastated by the death of their eight-year-old boy Jayden from a rare form of cancer last month, Tom and Nicole Lamb decided on the spur of the moment to pay for the customer behind them in the drive through . The gesture was supposed to be a symbolic thank-you to the community of Midland, Michigan for their support following Jayden's premature death on November 27th. However, once they returned home and posted what they had done onto Facebook, the Lambs were inundated with stories of 'paying-it-forward' gestures from Minneapolis to Seattle and across the Midwest. Scroll Down for Video . Tom and Nicole Lamb with brave Jayden were inspired to begin a 'pay-it-forward' movement after their young boy lost his life at the end of November . 'We didn't think we were starting a chain reaction, that's for sure,' said Tom. However, in the weeks following Jayden's brave passing from cancer over 30,000 people have joined his 'Keep On Truckin' Team Jayden' Facebook page to tell their stories of paying someone else's restaurant bill or giving children's toys to charity. Indeed, one generous person donated a diamond engagement ring to the Salvation Army in Midland worth $2000 with a simple note attached that read: 'Paying it Forward Jayden Style. God Bless.' 'We were shocked and amazed that someone would do this,' Jayden's father and stepmother, Tom and Nicole Lamb, told Yahoo! Shine in a joint statement. 'We know that this ring, at one point, meant everything to someone. The fact that they would pay it forward with the ring is so amazing.'

And all over the country, people are committing random acts of kindness in his memory. His cancer attacked his central nervous system and tens of thousands of people have been inspired by the poignant last words the boy spoke to his father before his death. 'He looked at me right in the eye and he said, 'I'm never going to get married, daddy,' Tom says. 'My heart sunk when he said that. I'm like, 'Why would you say that, buddy?' And he said, 'God needs me more.'' 'I miss him so much,' Tom says. 'It's so hard. I just want him back.' After Jayden's death, the Lamb family coped with their grief by doing little things to help others. 'The 'Pay it Forward Jayden Style' movement actually started the day before the showings of his funeral when we were just getting coffee,' the Lambs told Yahoo! Shine. 'Not knowing the person behind us, we still felt compelled to buy their coffee. It was just a small way for us to say thank you.' After his funeral on December 1st, the Lamb family made a trip to a local Walmart and decided to pay a total strangers layaway bill.

'We told the worker that it had to be for toys and that it had to be in honor of Jayden,' said Tom. 'It is just so amazing to be able to something for someone else.' Once the Lamb's realised that the 'Pay-it-forward' movement they had created to honor their son was on the way to becoming a nationwide phenomenon, they encourage members of the public to post their stories onto Facebook. 'Even though we are still grieving with the loss of Jayden, this is helping us cope and heal,' his dad and stepmom told Yahoo! Shine. 'We feel so blessed that our community and those outside of our community would do something in Jayden's honor. To have his name and his legacy still be carried out even after he has gained his angel wings in Heaven is so amazing to us.'

"By . Daniel Martin . PUBLISHED: . 19:35 EST, 22 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:54 EST, 22 March 2013 . Hundreds of managers have walked into new NHS jobs just weeks after pocketing huge redundancy payoffs. At least 2,200 staff – mostly bureaucrats – have been re-employed by a trust after taking voluntary or compulsory redundancy since May 2010. NHS managers who are made redundant receive one month’s pay for every year served, with the average payout since the general election standing at £48,000. Some staff receive hundreds of thousands of pounds. More problems: The Mail revealed this week that the NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson urged managers to wait six months before returning because of the 'reputational damage' it would cause the NHS . The total amount spent on payoffs for the 2,200 re-hired staff is not known – but it is expected to run into the tens of millions. Astoundingly, Department of Health rules state that managers do not forfeit their redundancy payments if they wait four weeks before taking another NHS job. Now the Government has admitted that the revolving door for hospital managers is in full swing even as the Health Service rations operations such as hip replacements and cataract surgery to save money. The Public Accounts Committee said yesterday that hospitals are restricting access to such procedures even though this means patients are left suffering. The committee’s chairman Margaret Hodge said she was ‘livid’ about the jobs merry-go-round. ‘It is clearly absurd that when NHS finances are so fragile  and under so much stress that money should be wasted like this,’ she said. ‘It’s mad. We’ve seen the first sign of rationing of operations like cataracts and knee operations. ‘With these pressures it is a betrayal of patients to use public money to fund redundancies for staff only to then re-employ them.’ Earlier this week the Mail revealed that under-fire NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson wrote to managers, urging them to wait six months before returning to the Health Service after they are made redundant. He wrote: ‘I would ask these individuals to be mindful of the possible reputational damage to themselves and to the NHS should they seek to gain paid employment or consultancy work in the NHS soon after they receive their redundancy payments.’ Thousands of NHS managers have been let go as part of Coalition reforms to cut bureaucracy and give doctors more power. Criticism: Labour's health spokesman Andy Burnham said: 'We always warned this reorganisation would be a colossal waste of money' On April 1, primary care trusts and strategic health authorities will disappear, to be replaced with clinical commissioning groups led by GPs. Many managers lost their jobs as a result of the re-organisation, but critics have long feared that many will simply take on new jobs at CCGs after receiving handsome redundancy payoffs. Now, in response to a parliamentary question, the Department of Health has admitted that the practice is already commonplace. The majority of the 2,200 will be managers, because theirs are the posts that have been targeted for redundancies. Those with less than two years’ service, or who took another NHS job within four weeks, will not have received a payoff. Nor will those who turned down a suitable job offer elsewhere in the NHS. However, although the Department of Health would not say how many of the 2,200 received payouts, it is understood that the majority did. The true number of workers re-hired after taking redundancy will actually be far higher, as the 2,200 figure only refers to people employed by NHS trusts and not those taken on directly by GPs. Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘It’s a huge waste of taxpayers’ money to re-hire staff you’ve just spent a fortune making redundant. ‘This completely undermines the purpose of redundancy, and highlights bad management decisions and poor allocation of resources. ‘Taxpayers can’t afford for the NHS to squander money like this, especially at a time when budgets are tight.’ Andy Burnham, Labour’s health spokesman, said: ‘We always warned this reorganisation would be a colossal waste of money and these figures prove it.’ The data was revealed by the Government following a parliamentary question from Valerie Vaz, a Labour member of the Health Select Committee. Health minister Dan Poulter told her that the 2,200 figure covers the period between May 1, 2010, and September 30, 2012, but does not include ‘those working in general practice, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and Chesterfield Royal Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, and some NHS staff who have transferred to local authorities and social enterprises’. A Department of Health spokesman said payoff data ‘is not collected centrally’. They stressed: ‘Our changes to the NHS represent a huge net gain for the taxpayer. Any costs associated with NHS reforms are one-off and dwarfed by the savings they will make – £5.5billion during this Parliament and £1.5billion every year thereafter.’ They added that NHS employers are required to make ‘every effort’ to redeploy staff before making them redundant.","NHS redundancies have cost the taxpayers millions in payoffs .

Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, pictured, has been jailed for a year this morning . After dozens of trials, hundreds of allegations and innumerable delaying tactics, the law caught up with Silvio Berlusconi yesterday when he was sentenced to a year in prison. But even now the former Italian prime minister won’t have to serve any time in jail – because he’s too old. Italian sentencing guidelines dictate that those over 75 are almost always spared jail. Berlusconi is 76. The billionaire media mogul was convicted of violating secrecy laws by publishing transcripts of phone calls tapped by the police. His brother, Paulo, 63, received a sentence of two years and three months. Paulo edits Il Giornale, which published the transcripts in an attempt to discredit the Centre-Left. Silvio Berlusconi owns the newspaper. The guilty verdict comes after inconclusive elections left Italy with a hung parliament. He has been taken to court 100 times but has rarely been convicted.aces two other trials for alleged tax fraud and paying for sex with an underage prostitute. Berlusconi, who had denied any wrongdoing, can seek to have the decision overturned before a court of appeal. Under Italian law, he is not expected to serve any prison term until all possible appeal trials have been carried out. The case had been delayed after judges accepted a plea from Berlusconi's defence team to postpone while he ran for re-election in the Italian general election last month. His defence team had accused the court of seeking a speedy verdict for political impact. But the verdict carries no impact on Berlusconi's eligibility to participate in a new government. His center-right coalition finished third in parliamentary elections that saw now clear winner. Delay: The case was postponed earlier this year when judges accepted a request from Berlusconi's defence team to delay it as he campaigned for the Italian general election . Talks on forming a new government are expected to begin March 20. The charge originated after an investigation into the failed takeover of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro by Unipol in 2005. The bid was rejected by Italy's central bank and contributed to the forced resignation of then-Bank of Italy chief Antonio Fazio. Silvio Berlusconi is currently appealing another conviction.

A video clip of Priscilla Daughtry picking up the ball and handing it to a young fan in the crowd at the game between Tampa Bay Rays and Philadelphia Phillies in Florida before realising her gaffe has since been viewed thousands of times on the internet. And now customers at the original Hooters in Clearwater have begun to recognise the embarrassed waitress from the clip.

Well fielded: Priscilla leaps from her pitch-side chair to stop a low struck ball which she doesn't realise is still in play . Video: Ooops! Hooters girl picks up live baseball . The footage shows Priscilla, dressed in trademark Hooters vest and tiny red shorts, leap from her seat to impressively stop a low struck ball with her glove. Unwittingly, she picks the ball up and offers it to the crowd, much to the delight of one young fan who gleefully accepts. It is only when another fan informs her that the ball was still in play when she stops it and several jeers erupt in the crowd, that she realises she has interrupted the game. Red-faced Priscilla covers her face with her baseball glove and slinks back to her pitch-side chair. She told Bright House Sports Network: 'As soon as I saw it coming to me I just got anxious and I scooped it right up and went over there to hand it to him (a young fan).

But Priscilla is not the first Hooters waitress to make such a faux pas - according to the commentators this is the second incident of its kind this spring.

Utilities giant General Electric has been accused of avoiding paying taxes as it was revealed that it is the American company with the most profits kept overseas. The company said in a February 26 regulatory filing that it was holding $108billion in profits outside of the US at the end of 2012, up from $102billion the previous year. And, according to analysis of 83 major US firms by Bloomberg, that amount is the highest of any of the biggest firms in America. Utilities giant General Electric is the American company with the most profits kept overseas according to analysis from Bloomberg. Its chief executive Jeff Immelt, pictured, has described the US tax system as 'old, complex and ineffective' General Electric said in a February 26 regulatory filing that it was holding $108billion in profits outside of the US at the end of 2012, up from $102billion the previous year . General Electric has faced criticism previously for holding profits overseas in a bid to avoid paying tax, with claims made by the New York Times that the firm paid no tax in the US at all in 2010. Those allegations are 'untrue' company spokesman Seth Martin told the Huffington Post. The company said that it did not intend to bring the profits back to the US and that most had already been reinvested abroad. But it is by no means the only company keeping large proportions of its profits overseas. Further analysis by the Wall Street Journal found that 60 big US firms kept on average more than 40 per cent of their annual profits overseas. Not only is the US missing out on revenue from taxes by companies keeping profits abroad, the cash will also not be used to invest in US business or payed out to shareholders. Many companies say that a growing amount of their profits are from increased sales overseas and have set up foreign subsidiary firms. Some other major firms, including web giant Google, have doubled their profits kept overseas in the past year, according to Bloomberg . It was claimed in a separate Bloomberg report that some US companies have increased their stash of profits by as much of 14 per cent in the last year and some firms including Google, Microsoft and Apple have doubled theirs. Drug manufacturers Johnson & Johnson and Merck both saved around $2billion by keeping their profits overseas according to Bloomberg. Many politicians, including Senator Charles Grassley want a crackdown on such practices. Although General Electric claims that its tax burden was low in 2010 because of huge losses in profits made during the economic downturn, campaign group Citizens for Tax Justice claimed that the company paid an average rate of just 1.8 per cent in tax between 2002 and 2011. Its Chief Executive Jeff Immelt described the US tax system as 'old, complex and uncompetitive' and said that it is having a negative effect on the country's economy.","GE has faced criticism before with claims that it paid no US tax in 2010 .

Reform plans: Binyamin Netanyahu's new coalition government is likely to attempt to change conscription laws for ultra-Orthodox Jews . Ultra-Orthodox Jews could be drafted into the Israeli military under plans by Binyamin Netanyahu's new government to cut the country's benefits bill. Mr Netanyahu's coalition government, which is expected to be announced later this week, wants to introduce new legislation that will see communities currently exempt from service conscripted. Former military chief Moshe 'Bogie' Ya'alon, the man expected to become Israel's next defence minister, is the driving force behind the controversial move which has already sparked protest among the ultra-Orthodox community. The move will take the community off the country's benefits bill. Netanyahu's government wouldn't be the first to attempt to alter the law, with succesive administrations seeking to reform the tax allowance and benefits system for ultra-Orthodox Jews. But the next government is said to stand a better chance than its predecessors as Mr Netanyahu is to exclude the ultra-Orthodox Shas party from his coalition, instead including the centrist Yesh Atid party, the Jewish Home party and the Hatnua pary. Mr Ya'alon's emergence in Mr Netanyahu's government represents a change in political direction with his appointment likely to herald a tougher policy towards Iran. Amir Buhbot, military analyst for the Walla news site, told The Times: 'When it comes to Iran they (Mr Netanyahu and Mr Ya’alon) have mirror opinions. 'They both believe that sanctions are important, but will not hesitate if Israel needs to carry out a strike on Iran. 'Ya’alon is the one that helped draft up the plans on Iran, he knows the capabilities of the army and would be the most trusted to lead them in that scenario.' The right wing former intelligence chief has been critical of Europe and the US for dragging their feet and sending out 'mixed messages' to Iran and has called for an international coalition to confront the country because of the danger it poses. Mr Netanyahu, who will control 70 seats of the 120 seat parliament in Israel, could be set to formally come to an agreement with coalition partners as early as tomorrow, according to The Times. New rules: Ultra-Orthodox Jews could soon be drafted into the Israeli military.

Police in France have said that the 63-year-old woman had intended to take her own life in the garden of her home in south east France yesterday. She is said to have walked into the garden with a rifle and fired several test shots to ensure that the gun was working. She then turned the gun on herself and was about to pull the trigger. But she was saved when her pet German Shepherd jumped on her and moved the gun so that she missed her shot. The woman suffered minor injuries in the incident, say police. A police officer told Le Figaro: 'At the moment she pulled the trigger, her dog jumped on her and diverted the shot.' He added that the animal 'probably sensed things and knocked into her to save her'. The woman suffered a chest wound but was found conscious by her husband.

Twinkies could be back on sale in stores by the summer after manufacturer Hostess was bought in a $410million deal. The snacks, along with other Hostess products including Wonder bread, have not been produced since November when the company filed for liquidation following strike action by the Bakery Workers union. But the company announced to the bankruptcy court on Monday that a winning bid for Hostess had been tabled by private equity firms Apollo Global Management and Metropoulos & Co. The winning bid also secured five of the company's closed bakeries as part of the bid. Twinkies manufacturer Hostess has been bought out in a $410million dollar deal, it was announced this week . They're back: The much loved snacks could be back on supermarket shelves as early as this summer following the buyout . Hostess had forewarned the bankruptcy court in December that it was narrowing down the bids it received for its brands and . expected to sell off its snack cakes and bread to separate buyers. The company said then that a likely suitor had emerged for the brand, which includes Twinkies, Ding Dongs and Ho Hos, along with Dolly Madison cakes, which includes Coffee Cakes and Zingers, said Joshua Scherer of Perella Weinberg Partners. They said at the time that another viable bid had been made for Drake's cakes, which includes Devil Dogs, Funny Bones and Yodels. That bidder was also said to want to buy the Drake's plant in Wayne, N.J., which Scherer said is the country's only kosher bakery plant. Iconic: Some of the company's other big names, including Wonder Bread could also be back on sale soon . It had been predicted that the auctions could be very . active for some of the brands, given the number of parties that had . expressed interest. About 30 plants were also likely to be sold with the brands with six plants, several warehouses and a fleet of trucks likely to be closed or scrapped. Hostess hired a firm Hilco to act . as a sales agent for those additional assets; the firm also gave . Hostess a $30 million loan to maintain operations during its . liquidation, which was expected to take about a year. Hostess, . based in Irving, Texas, had said potential buyers included major . packaged food companies and national retailers, such as big-box . retailers and supermarkets. Factory line: Workers prepare Hostess Twinkies for packaging at the Interstate Bakeries Corporation facility in Illinois - production had stopped after liquidation proceedings began . The company stressed it needs to . move quickly in the sale process to capitalize on the outpouring of . nostalgia sparked by its bankruptcy.

But the following month, an attorney for Hostess said in court that figure was . down to about 1,100 employees. The . liquidation of Hostess ultimately means the loss of about 18,000 jobs, . not including those shed in the years leading to the company's failure. Hostess has been in the process of selling off all it's brand after going into receivership in November . The company's demise came after years of management turmoil and turnover, with workers saying the company failed to invest in updating its snack cakes and breads. Hostess filed for its second Chapter 11 bankruptcy in less than a decade last January, citing steep costs associated with its unionized workforce. The company was able to reach a new contract agreement with its largest union, the Teamsters, but the bakers union rejected the terms and went on strike in early November. A week later, Hostess announced its plans to liquidate, saying the strike crippled its ability to maintain normal production. Although Hostess sales have been declining over the years, they had still been clocking in at between $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion a year.","Hostess Brands Inc had been in liquidation since union strikes in November .

Admission: Former Flamengo goalkeeper Bruno Fernandes de Souza told a court that his girlfriend had been killed, chopped up and fed to dogs . A star Brazilian footballer has been jailed for more than two decades for ordering the kidnap and murder of his girlfriend, who was dismembered and fed to his pet dogs. Bruno Fernandes de Souza, 28, who was tipped to play for Brazil at the 2014 World Cup, was sentenced to 22 years and three months in prison for the murder of Eliza Samudio, whom he apparently had killed to avoid paying child support after she gave birth to his love child. Judge Marixa Fabiane Rodrigues said the goalkeeper, who played for Brazil's biggest team Flamengo, had 'meticulously calculated' Ms Samudio's execution. He told the court in Contagem, south-east Brazil, that the footballer was 'twisted' and had 'instilled in his personality a total misunderstanding of values.' He added: 'Bruno believed that, by making the body disappear, he could ensure total impunity.' The former player had previously denied any knowledge of what happened to the 25-year-old, but told a court this week how his best friend Luiz Henrique Romao had paid someone to kill her. He admitted that although he hadn't ordered his former lover to be killed, he had 'accepted' it. The goalkeeper is accused of planning Ms Samudio's abduction and murder with eight others including his wife Dayane, another former lover, a cousin and former policeman Marcos Santos. It has been alleged that he watched as Santos tortured her and then helped him to chop her body. Parts of the woman's corpse are alleged to have been fed to Bruno's pet rottweillers, while the rest was buried in concrete. At an earlier trial, Romao was found guilty of Ms Samudio's murder and jailed for 15 years. Santos will be put on trial next month. Jailed: Bruno Souza, former goalkeeper of Brazil's Flamengo soccer club, has been sentenced to 22 years and three months in prison for the murder of his former lover . Model: Eliza Samudio is believed to have met Bruno at a party held by another footballer. She later presented a report (left) to police against the footballer, claiming he had got her pregnant . Bruno, . who before his arrest had been linked with a multi-million pound . transfer to AC Milan, has always claimed Ms Samudio was alive and had . left the country. Her body has never been found. But he told the court in Contagem that his cousin, Jorge Rosa, who had witnessed the murder, had told him what had happened. He . claimed that after kidnapping Ms Samudio, Romao had taken her to a . house in Belo Horizonte where hired killer Santos was waiting. Broke down: Souza, 28, is seen in the Forum of Contagem, metropolitan region of Belo Horizonte, southeastern Brazil, this week . He said: 'There he held her hands and asked [Romao] to tie them in front of her, and put a tie around her neck. 'And [Romao] even kicked Eliza's legs . away. That's what Jorge told me. And that they had chopped up her body, . that they had thrown her body for the dogs to eat.' The former star admitted that he feels 'guilty' for her death despite instisting that he never oredered the killing. Ms . Samudio, who had previously claimed to have had an affair with Real . Madrid ace Cristiano Ronaldo, met Bruno at a footballers' party in May . 2009 and fell pregnant by accident, it is claimed. The . goalkeeper demanded she have an abortion but she went ahead with the . pregnancy, instead insisting that he assume paternity of the child. Before her disappearance on June 4, 2010, Ms Samudio had approached police claiming she had been held captive by Bruno and his associates, who forced her to take an illegal abortion drug. Bruno allegedly put a gun to her head and told her: 'You don't know who I am or what I'm capable of - I'm from the favela.' The baby, Bruninho, was born in February 2010, but the player refused to acknowledge he was the father. Prosecutors allege that Bruno ordered Ms Samudio's murder after she told him she would take legal action to force him to pay child support. Under arrest: The footballer is seen here being taken into custody in 2010 in connection with the disappearance of his girlfriend . In . a statement to police, the footballer's teenage cousin Jorge Rosa . claimed he and Romao picked up Ms Samudio and her son from a Rio de . Janeiro hotel after she accepted an invitation by the footballer to talk . about the paternity claims. He . said they drove her 220 miles to a property in Belo Horizonte which . Bruno and his wife used as a weekend retreat, where she was held captive . for six days. Ms Samudio . was then allegedly handed over to former military policeman Santos, who . committed 'barbaric tortures' on her before strangling her to death with . a neck tie in front of her four-month-old son. Santos, . who was allegedly paid £8,000 to murder her, played loud music on a . stereo to drown out the woman's screams, it is claimed. Edson . Moreira, a detective who investigated the case, said: 'His acts were . almost impossible to describe without breaking down - images from the . worst nightmare you could imagine.' Police . later found Ms Samudio's four-month-old baby in a Belo Horizonte slum, . alleged to have been abandoned there by Bruno's wife Dayane. DNA tests . later proved the footballer's paternity. The child is now being looked . after by Ms Samudio's mother. Bruno's trial, which began on Monday, is expected to conclude today. If found guilty he could be jailed for up to 41 years.

As well as the offensive posts, some of which insulted Powell himself, pictures were uploaded to Powell's Facebook page showing screen grabs of the hacker's previous access to email accounts of Mr Bush and his siblings Neil and Dorothy. According to thesmokinggun.com, the posts included two paintings by Mr Bush that he had emailed to his sister in December last year and a photo sent by Neil Bush to his siblings also in December. An album with 18 images entitled 'George ""Dubya"" Walker Bush Hacking' is reported to have been posted on the page with each photo branded with a handwritten 'Guccifer' inscription. General Powell later took to Facebook and posted an apology to more than 82,000 people who 'like' his page, acknowledging that his page had been hacked. He posted: Dear Friends, as most of you realize, my fb page has obviously been hacked. I'm sorry you have to see all the stupid, obscene posts that are popping up.

Holiday company Thomson has had to delay operating Boeing's troubled new ultra-green Dreamliner plane from May for at least two months. The aircraft - the Boeing 787 - has been beset with operational difficulties, including an issue with on-board batteries catching fire mid-air. Thomson had been hoping to start flying the new quiet, fuel-efficient plane from May, but they will now not be able to do so until at least July. The £10 supplement paid to them by holidaymakers for their 787 flights will now be refunded. Delay: After a Dreamliner, like this Boeing 787, made an emergency landing in Japan, holiday company Thomson has announced it has delayed using them . until at least July . Disappointment: Thomson say that Boeing have not told them when their new 787s will arrive so have had to delay its May roll-out . Already years late due to production difficulties, the much-heralded Dreamliner finally entered service with Japanese carrier All Nippon Airways in October 2011. But a series of battery fires have affected flights of late, with various national aviation authorities ordering the grounding of the planes. Thomson, which is due to receive eight Dreamliners, is the UK launch customer for the plane and was busy promoting trips on the 787 which can seat between 210 and 290 passengers on medium-range routes. But the company today said 'in the absence of a delivery schedule from Boeing', it had decided to switch customers booked on the 787 Dreamliner in May and June to alternative planes. 'Our dedicated customer service team is in the process of contacting all customers impacted to inform them that they will now be travelling on Thomson Airways (Boeing) 767 long-haul aircraft, which have premium cabins,' a spokesman said. 'The supplement paid for the 787 Dreamliner flight will be refunded to those customers who proceed with their original holiday bookings, and customers will also have the option to amend their holiday without incurring any amendment fees. 'We understand how frustrating and disappointing this news will be for those customers looking forward to flying on the 787 Dreamliner. 'We are equally as disappointed that Boeing was not able to confirm a delivery date for us but unfortunately these circumstances are out of our control.' Emergency: Charred batteries taken from the All . Nippon Airways 787, left, and the Dreamliner parked at Boston's Logan . International Airport, right . Thomson's parent company, Tui, had ordered 13 of the Dreamliners, of which Thomson had been allocated eight. The airline originally hoped it would receive the first four 787s some . time before May 2013, with the other four arriving by May 2015. Flying from Glasgow, Manchester, Gatwick and East Midlands Airports, the . first Dreamliners were due to operate to Cancun in Mexico and Orlando . in Florida, with the first flight on May 1. Thomson said it could not comment on just how many passengers had been . affected by the Dreamliner delay due to 'commercial sensitivities'. In one of several scares, a battery overheated on a Boeing 787 flight in Japan and forced the plane to make an emergency landing because it was incorrectly wired. The All Nippon Airways (ANA) Dreamliner touched down in Takamatsu when the lithium ion battery sparked an on-board fire, prompting the worldwide grounding of the Boeing 787 jets due to safety concerns. Japan's Transport Safety Board has said the battery for the aircraft's auxiliary power unit was improperly connected to the main battery, which overheated during the flight. The incident on January 16 came days after a battery exploded on a Dreamliner parked at Boston's Logan International Airport. A mechanic conducting a routine post-flight inspection on the Boeing 787 jet discovered smoke in the cockpit. Passengers had disembarked the plane just 15 minutes before the blaze broke out. In December Boeing said U.S. regulators had ordered the entire fleet of 787 jets to be inspected for a possible fuel line problem. United flight 1146 from Houston to Newark was diverted to New Orleans on Tuesday for an unspecified mechanical problem - one month to the day of the Dreamliner's historic launch on November 4. The mechanical issues, while not necessarily uncommon, were yet another headache for Boeing, a company still working to overcome the negative perception of production problems that delayed delivery of the 787 by 3-1/2 years. British Airways is due to receive the first of 24 Dreamliners in May while Virgin Atlantic is scheduled to get the first of its 16 Dreamliners in September 2014. BA said today that it had not received any notification from Seattle-based Boeing of a delay to the delivery of its first Dreamliners, with a total of four due to be delivered this year. BA added that the 787s would be replacement aircraft so that if there was a delay in delivery the existing aircraft (Boeing 767s) would carry on operating. Virgin said it was still working towards its scheduled September 2014 delivery date. Grand designs: Boeing had hoped the Dreamliner would revolutionise air travel though it has failed to get off the ground . Sky's the limit! The first class cabin features larger windows, special lighting and filtered air throughout the plane . Welcome aboard! An upgraded video screen on the back of a seat shows off the menu screen to some of its entertainment features that passengers are desperate to use themselves . There was better news for BA today as the airline was able to announce that tickets were on sale for its first flight using the superjumbo Airbus A380 - the world's largest passenger plane. BA's first superjumbo flight will be from London to Los Angeles on October 15, with London-Hong Kong services using the A380 starting on November 15. The superjumbo, which first entered service with Singapore Airlines in October 2007, is capable of carrying well over 500 passengers, but BA's configuration will see the double-decker plane carrying 469 travellers. Start-up fares to Los Angeles begin at £499 return, with Hong Kong prices from £559 return.BA has ordered 12 superjumbos with deliveries taking place from now until 2016, including three this year.","Holiday company ordered them for May, but won't get them until at least July .

The next generation Xbox console will require Microsoft's Kinect motion sensors to be connected when playing games, according to games industry sources. The machine - the follow up to the hugely successful Xbox 360 - will also feature new-look control pads and be capable of simultaneously running apps alongside video games. Having Kinect as a requirement has . raised eyebrows among gamers as it is still widely criticised by 'hardcore' gamers for being a gimmick that adds little value to games. Successor: The Xbox 360 is a hugely popular system, but recent games have showed a gulf in the graphical quality between its aging hardware and the current crop of PCs . That's despite Microsoft having sold 20million of the motion-sensor units. The new machine is codenamed Durango. A source who is said to have previously revealed details on games consoles, told Kotaku he has had access to the development kits. The source went on to describe the graphical leap between Durango and the current 360 to echo the difference between Halo 2 on the original Xbox and Crysis on a high-powered PC. The website claims that a new Kinect-style motion control will be included with every Durango sold, and must be plugged in and calibrated for the console to even function. It will also 'always be watching you', with a new camera able to track up to six individual skeletons in the same room at all times. This would suggest that the system could instantly identity the person and also be related to the recently-patented Microsoft system for monitoring or charging users based on who is watching what. The quality of the Kinect camera has been improved, too, with reports that it is capable of tracking thumb movement or recognise when your hand is open and closed. Other reports suggest it can also recognise when you are angry, sad and exited. Big reveal: Sony are almost certain to showcase their next-gen console on February 20 . The next Xbox console could require gamers to be permanently connected to the internet - ruling out the use of second-hand games, according to a magazine report. The next-generation console will 'be absolutely committed to online functionality', says the magazine, quoting sources with first-hand experience of Microsoft's latest console. Gamers will be required to activate games in the same way as most other software from Microsoft and other publishers is already activated online, the report in Edge magazine claimed. This would mean that the game is tied to the console it is activated on, and to the Xbox Live account activating it, making it impossible to sell on old games. An activation system would check that you are the registered user of the game each time you start it up - you wouldn't even be able to lend it to a friend. The site claims the new Xbox will run on custom hardware, including an 8-core, 64-bit CPU running at 1.6ghz, 800mhz DirectX11 graphics processor units and custom hardware blocks to take help take the pressure off the CPU. The console is also reportedly capable of delivering stereo 3D content and ships with built-in wifi. Audio output will be via either HDMI or S/PDIF (optical) and can support 7.1 channels. It will ship with 500GB hard drive, too. Cleverly, Durango titles can be designed in sections, so the now mandatory installations can take place automatically while you play. Sadly, Kotaku claims that Xbox 360 controllers will not work with Durango as Microsoft are using what they call a 'new wireless technology'. Sony, meanwhile, have kept their hand even closer to their chest regarding their next-generation console. However, it is widely expected that they will reveal their PS3 successor at a major event in New York City on Feburary 20. Microsoft will likely wait until E3 to make an announcement with the console expected to retail at the end of the year.","New console, code-named 'Durango', can simultaneously run apps and video games, according to rumours .

Almost 200 Scotland Yard detectives are working on the three investigations linked to phone hacking and the scope of their probe has now got bigger, it has emerged. As the total cost to the taxpayer reaches £17.5million, the arm of the operation looking into bribery of public . officials - codenamed Elveden - has been asked to look at unpaid informants. Experts say the decision 'crosses a Rubicon' and will stop genuine police whistleblowers speaking to journalists because they will be scared of arrest. Two officers been held by the Met in the past month for allegedly passing information to reporters, but there is no suspicion either asked for any money for it. Concern: As the cost of the three inquiries linked to hacking break through the £17.5m barrier an area looking at payment to public officials had widened its scope . Human rights lawyer Simon McKay, warned of the Elveden expansion today saying: 'I think the Rubicon has been crossed here. This is a deeply troubling evolution of the investigation in my opinion and raises really serious civil liberty issues. 'The relationship between a public official and a journalist of itself cannot be criminal,' he told The Guardian. Operation Weeting: Probe into phone hacking. Set up in January 2011 it has 96 officers working on it and has cost £11.2million so far. Operation Elveden: Probe into corrupt payments to officials. Elveden has 70 police investigating and . has cost £5million. Operation Tuleta: Probe into computer hacking. Set up in June 2011, Tuleta has cost £1.3million and has 19 officers on its staff. Total arrests across all three: 108 . Julian Panayiotou, of the Independent Police Support Group, added: 'Officers are being frightened into not speaking to journalists. This will act as a deterrent to other officers coming forward to report corruption in the police. 'The systems in place in police forces and the IPCC for dealing with public interest disclosures are not trusted and ineffective.' Scotland Yard has three parallel . investigations sparked by journalists at the News of the World: Weeting into phone hacking, Elveden . into corrupt payments and Tuleta into computer hacking, and 185 officers are working on them. Weeting . has 96 officers and has cost £11.2million, Elveden has 70 officers and . has cost £5million and Tuleta has cost £1.3million and has 19 officers. It will all cost £40million in total and run for at least three more years, the Met says. So far around 108 people, including more than . 70 journalists, have been arrested in relation to the three linked inquiries. These include former News International chief executive Rebekah . Brooks and David  Cameron's former spin doctor Andy Coulson, have been . charged with offences linked to hacking. Others have been charged with perverting the course of justice over . claims they attempted to conceal evidence including archives and . computers. Charges: The investigation was started after phone hacking was uncovered at the News of the World . High profile: Former Chief Executive of News International Rebekah Brooks and her husband Charlie Brooks are among those arrested . They include . Brooks, as well as her husband Charlie and four former employees . including her driver, security guard and personal assistant. Held: Frank Armstrong, the former Assistant Commissioner of City of London Police, has been arrested over alleged leaks to a journalist . Scotland Yard investigators have seized 12 terabytes of data, the equivalent of one million phone books. Operation Yewtree, the police investigation into alleged sexual abuse . by paedophile Jimmy Savile and others, has only had 30 officers . installed at a cost of £2million. This month detectives arrested a former deputy chief constable who wrote a scathing report about a breach of security at Prince William’s 21st birthday party over alleged leaks to a journalist. Frank Armstrong, 52, until recently the £130,000-a-year second in charge of City of London Police, is the first chief officer to be arrested as a result of inquiries arising from Scotland Yard’s Operation Elveden . Investigators arrested Armstrong on suspicion of misconduct in a public office but stressed that ‘at this stage’, no money is alleged to have changed hands between him and the reporter. His arrest at his home in South-West London came just two months after he was awarded the Queen’s Police Medal for distinguished service and followed an illustrious career which included a spell as head of Tony Blair’s Special Branch protection team. Weeks earlier another respected senior officer, Met Chief Superintendent Andy Rowell, was arrested over alleged disclosures of confidential information to the media. He, too, is not suspected of receiving any payment from the media. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Experts say the decision to widen Elveden 'crosses a Rubicon'

Support: Prime Minister David Cameron initially backed setting the contribution cap for people who need residential care at £35,000. Now it could be £60,000 or even £75,000 . Middle-class couples who need residential care in old age could be hit with bills as high as £150,000. Under Coalition plans to be unveiled in the New Year, the upper limit on the amount that must be contributed towards care could be £60,000 or even £75,000 per person. This ‘cap’ is much higher than the £35,000 suggested by last year’s independent review into England’s care funding system. If both husband and wife end up moving into residential care, it could mean they will have to pay out up to £150,000 before the state steps in. In addition, they will still have to meet accommodation costs – the ‘bed and board’ charge for care home stays. This could push the total outlay to almost £200,000. Critics say setting the cap so high will do little to stop thousands of pensioners having to sell their homes each year, denying their children an inheritance. And they are likely to accuse David Cameron of letting the elderly down, as Downing Street has previously attracted positive coverage by backing the review’s proposal of a £35,000 cap. At present, care home residents can be landed with unlimited charges if they have assets, including their house, of more than £23,500. Those who have no savings get care completely free. Ministers have pledged to increase this threshold to £100,000, meaning people will no longer see their savings depleted to below this level. But the benefit could be wiped out by the imposition of a cap that is more than double the amount that was originally expected. In addition, it is understood that the new system may not even be put in place until as late as 2017, despite promises to sort the issue out before the next General Election, due in 2015. At least 20,000 elderly people have to sell their homes every year to pay unlimited care costs. Last year, a Government-commissioned report by economist Andrew Dilnot concluded that a lifetime cap should be imposed of between £35,000 and £50,000, with the state stepping in to pay the rest. At that time, a senior Conservative source told the Daily Mail: ‘The Prime Minister said “We’ve got to do Dilnot. We’re going to do this”.’ Mr Cameron said: ‘I hope to be able to announce the way forward by the next election but we’ve got to find the money first. It seems to me absolutely vital.’ He added that he was confident the funding would be found. But Chancellor George Osborne balked at the estimated £1.7billion a year cost at a time when he is trying to bring down Britain’s deficit. Betrayal: The £75,000 proposed cap would be more than double the amount recommended by economist Andrew Dilnot . To bring down the cost, it seems ministers are considering a higher cap of £60,000 or perhaps even £75,000, meaning the state will not be called upon to pay as much. The cap would be for individuals, meaning that couples could be asked to pay £150,000. In addition, the cap only covers the cost of nursing and personal care, such as help with washing and dressing. It does not include the ‘bed and board’ cost of food and heating, which add up to between £7,000 and £10,000  a year. Residents would have to pay this on top of their care fees, potentially pushing the total cost towards the £200,000 level. Whitehall sources said that no final decision had been taken on the level of the cap, but that ‘the higher end of what has been speculated is most likely’. Professor Dilnot also suggested that the assets threshold of £23,500, below which people have to pay nothing towards their residential care, should be raised substantially to £100,000. It is likely that ministers will respect this part of his recommendations. Last night Ros Altmann, director general of the over-50s group Saga, said such a high cap would be a ‘betrayal’ of pensioners. ‘A £75,000 cap is too high and would still mean most middle-class families, especially outside London, would lose their home and life savings because the cap excludes accommodation costs which will be many thousands more,’ she said. ‘This high a cap would not allow an insurance market to develop and is more than double the £35,000 recommended by Dilnot.’ The social care plan is one of the key parts of a Coalition ‘mid-term review’, which will also involve a commitment to introduce a single-tier state pension of about £140 a week. The review will include measures to cut the cost of childcare, and is expected to commit ministers to new ways to fund the motorway and trunk road network, such as by handing construction and maintenance to the private sector. A Department of Health Spokesperson said: 'We want this country to be one of the best places in Europe to grow old and that is why in July we announced the most extensive reforms of care and support in over 60 years. 'As part of the reforms, we committed to taking action to ensure people do not have to sell their homes to pay for care. 'We also agreed that the Dilnot Commission's model of the cap on care costs is the right basis for any new funding model, but given the current economic situation, we need to look carefully at how we can pay for this.'","Couples could face £150,000 care bill under new plans .

Striker Francisco Sandaza has been suspended by Rangers pending an investigation into a hoax telephone conversation . The club had launched an investigation into the conduct of Sandaza after he was tricked by a Glasgow taxi driver into admitting he only moved to Ibrox for the money. The Spaniard took no part in today's training session and, after discussions between the player, the club and manager Ally McCoist, he was suspended while the investigation into the incident is ongoing. In a phone conversation, which was recorded for 23 minutes, Sandaza revealed details of his salary to a cabbie named Tommy, who was posing as a Los Angeles-based agent. The taxi driver is a known prankster, who has duped footballers before. The Spaniard also complains at the standard of football in Division Three claiming: 'I didn’t sign for the level, I signed for the money. I’ll get another contract after Rangers.' Scroll down to listen to the full recording... Suspended: Francisco Sandaza was tricked by a Celtic supporter posing as an agent working in Los Angeles . Born in Toledo, Spain in 1984, Sandaza started out with Valencia . reserves before signing for his hometown club. He moved to Dundee United . in 2008 and scored 10 goals (five of them against the Old Firm) in his . first season. Groin and hernia problems hampered his progress and he signed for Brighton in 2010 after an unsuccessful trial at Swansea. He was released after one season and signed a one-year deal with St . Johnstone. Twelve goals in 17 appearances tempted Rangers to make a . pre-contract offer but he turned them down before the club went into . administration. Sandaza left Perth after a season and signed for Rangers last summer as a free agent. Rangers issued a statement on the club's website after the forward's suspension. It read: 'Francisco Sandaza has been suspended by the club pending an investigation into comments made by the player in a recorded telephone conversation. 'The club, Francisco and his agent have had discussions and manager Ally McCoist also spoke with the player, who did not take part in today’s training session. 'Francisco will not return to the club while the investigation is underway. 'Rangers regard this as an extremely serious issue but there will be no further comment until the inquiry, which could take a week, has been completed.' Celtic supporter Tommy - who has never revealed his surname - was pretending to be middle-man Jack McGonigle and has previously tricked disgraced former Rangers owner Craig Whyte and ex-SFA chief executive David Taylor, now a senior UEFA official. Sandaza tells the prankster he is on £4,500 a week for the first season of his four-year deal, which goes up to £10,000 in the final year. By that time the Ibrox club would expect to be back in the top flight of Scottish football. The 28-year-old striker, who believed 'McGonigle' was approaching him about a move to Major League Soccer in the United States, admitted he would quit Ibrox for a better deal but insists he does not want the club to know about the conversation. He says: 'Do not do it officially through the club. Send me the contract first. I don’t want trouble if Rangers find out about this.' Sandaza has potentially contravened Scottish FA rules too. They state that no player can attempt to negotiate or arrange a transfer with another club while under contract. Sandaza signed for Rangers from St Johnstone last summer. He has also played for Dundee United. Don't tell the boss: Rangers manager Ally McCoist will not be pleased with Sandaza being pranked .

Apple has promised a software update for their latest mobile operating system after hackers published a video showing how to unlock any iPhone running it. The YouTube video and an accompanying explanation details a relatively simple combination of button presses which can quickly bypass the phone's password screen. Once entered, it opens the main phone screen where any thief or snoop would be able to make calls, read and send messages, edit contacts, and go through stored data like photos and apps. Scroll down for video . Security exploit: Apple has promised a fix after a YouTube video emerged which showed how anyone can bypass the passcode screen in iPhones running iOS 6.1, leaving the mobiles potentially open to thieves and hackers . In a response to tech site AllThingsD, Apple spokesman Trudy Miller aknowledged the vulnerability and said the company was working on a quick fix. 'Apple takes user security very seriously. We are aware of this issue, and will deliver a fix in a future software update,' she said. It is the latest embarrassment for the Silicon Valley tech company after another recent bug in the same operating system, iOS 6.1, was found to overload corporate email servers. Business users trying to sync their contacts, mail and other content found themselves kicked off their company's Microsoft Exchange servers, and Apple is yet to publish a fix for the problem. Prior to that, a third bug in the .1 update to iOS 6 was found to cause problems with 3G network performance on the iPhone 4S. That was quickly fixed with a 6.1.1 update released exclusively to users of the 4S. Relatively simple: All a malicious user has to do is enter a series of button presses and the phones boot into their main screen. It is the third major bug found so far in Apple's latest mobile operating system . Google's privacy practices are drawing heat after an Australian software developer said the company was providing him with personal information, including email addresses, of everyone who purchased his mobile app. The information that Google shared, which included customers' full names, email and some postal code information, was not the result of a glitch with its software. Rather it appears to be in accordance with Google's existing policies for its app store and its Google Wallet payment service. Privacy advocates believe Google has not been clear  in informing consumers about the practice. Google has 'buried' the notice about how it shares users' personal information in fine print rather than obtain the express consent of users, said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. 'Meaningful consent is about people understanding what they're getting into. It's about not tricking them,' he said. 'In a situation like this, where people just don't know what information is being transferred or who it's going to or for what purpose, it seems ridiculous to say that Google has consent.' The video detailing the iPhone 5 passcode hack was published onto YouTube by videosdebarraquito at the end of January and has already been viewed nearly 300,000 times. It tells how a rapid combination of emergency call, keypad, power button and cancel button taps will bypass the phone's security, leaving it accessible to anyone. In text accompanying the video, the user describes it as an '[e]asy trick that allows bypass an iPhone's passcode and get full access (see and edit) to contacts list, list of recent calls, favorite contacts, and even make a call to any phone number on the hacked device and erase the log.' The text details the precise combination of actions to carry out to exploit the vulnerability. The user adds that you can use it '[f]or prank your friends. For a magic show... Use it as you want, at your own risk, but... please... do not use this trick to do evil !!!' It is not the first time Apple's devices have been found to be vulnerable to such a trick. A similar bug allowed the same kind of access in gadgets running iOS 4.1, Gizmodo reported. It took a month for Apple to release the .2 update to that operating system which removed the vulnerability.","Combination of button presses bypasses lock screen .

Britain faces further humiliating downgrades to its credit rating after a lost decade that has seen the  slowest economic recovery on record, the Chancellor was warned tonight. In a blow to George Osborne’s credibility, the Office for Budget Responsibility, the official Treasury watchdog, today halved its growth forecasts for this year and warned that the plan to cut the deficit has stalled. Official figures show real wages are due to fall by 2.4 per cent over the lifetime of this Parliament – seized on by Labour as evidence that the Coalition will leave people worse off at the next General Election than they were in 2010. Scroll down for video . How forecasts for GDP growth in 2013 have deteriorated over the past year . Plateau: Public sector net borrowing - the amount of extra debt the Government must take on each year - will remain roughly the same this year and in 2013/14 . The dire prognosis prompted ratings . agencies Standard & Poor’s and Fitch to say they were looking at the . UK’s AAA status. Rival agency Moody’s has already stripped Britain of . its gold-plated credit score. Labour leader Ed Miliband taunted Mr Osborne for delivering ‘a downgraded Budget from a downgraded Chancellor’. The OBR said that economic . output will not return to its pre-crisis peak until early 2015 – marking . seven lost years since the slump started in 2008.

Gloomy: The Chancellor delivered his Budget against a backdrop of economic turmoil . But the OBR slashed its growth . forecasts for the whole of 2013 from the 1.2 per cent it was expecting . as recently as December to just 0.6 per cent. It also trimmed its 2014 . forecast from 2 per cent to 1.8 per cent. OBR chief Robert Chote said Britain . is suffering a historically slow recovery. ‘What has been remarkable has . been the slow pace of the recovery,’ he said. The Bank of England warned  that . there was ‘a roughly 50-50 chance’ of a triple-dip but added that ‘it . remained probable that growth would pick up as the year wore on’. The economic slump has hit  tax . receipts and exports remain sluggish, making it ever more difficult for . the Chancellor to balance the books. Mr Osborne has made tackling the deficit and reducing borrowing the centrepiece of the Government’s economic policy. The deficit fell from £159billion in . 2009-10 under Labour to £121billion in 2011-12 as Mr Osborne’s austerity . measures were implemented. But the OBR said progress has stalled, with the Government set to borrow £120.9billion this year and £119.8billion in 2013-14. And the Chancellor is now set to . borrow £434billion over the next five years – around £55billion more . than expected at the time of the Autumn Statement in December. The national debt is on course to top . £1.63trillion in 2017-18 – some £100billion more than expected in . December and nearly double the £840billion black hole the Coalition . inherited in 2010. Mr Osborne was forced to admit that debt will not start falling as a percentage of national income until 2017-18. This is two years later than he planned. ‘It is taking longer than anyone hoped,’ he admitted. Graph showing GDP estimates and revisions from the last quarter of 2008 to the end of 2012 . The Chancellor has called for more . public spending cuts in order to be able to say that borrowing has . dropped this year compared with last year. Mr Chote said borrowing will be ‘essentially flat’ for three years before starting to fall again in the run up to the election. The Budget small print reveals how the sluggish economy is hitting ordinary families. Official figures showed average wages . grew by just 1.2 per cent in the past 12 months – less than half the . 2.8 per cent rate of inflation – leaving millions of workers out of . pocket. The Bank of England warned that . inflation will remain stubbornly high for another three years as the . squeeze on family finances intensified. Mr Miliband said: ‘Who is paying the price for the Chancellor’s failure? Britain’s families.’ In his first Budget he predicted living standards would rise over the Parliament. But wages are flat.

And families are squeezed.’ S&P said it was ‘examining the . details of the Budget’ to assess the future of Britain’s AAA rating . while Fitch launched a ‘formal review’.","Office for Budget Responsibility halves growth prediction as Britain hovers above triple-dip recession .

The parents of a child suffering from a rare skin disorder have launched an initiative to educate the public after they were continually abused in the street. Jack Oldacres, the son Danny, 32, and Julie, 38, was born with Netherton's syndrome, which is characterised by chronic skin inflammation. After three years of being taunted and blamed for their son's burnt appearance the couple from Nuneaton have set up the first dedicated fund to further research into the little-known condition at the University College in London. Danny and Julie Oldacres discovered that their son Jack was born with Netherton's syndrome, which is characterised by chronic skin inflammation . Netherton's syndrome affects only one in 800,000 people and there are as few as 16 . cases in the UK. It leaves those affected with red, itchy, flaking skin which needs to be washed off . twice a day in a sterilising bath to prevent it becoming infected. It also causes severe dehydration and stunted growth. Danny said: 'People think we've left him for too long in the sun, or that he's been scalded in the bath. 'I once had a woman shout across the street 'How dare you leave your son out in the sun too long?' 'I walked over to explain to her that he had a condition and she just said 'oh' and walked off, no word of an apology.' Jack at The George Eliot Hospital on August 26, 2008 taking his first bath when the condition was discovered . Over sixteen months the family have raised £14,000 for their new fund - far more than they had expected to. They said that the amount is more than has ever been donated to the cause over the past nine years. Danny, who works for the Royal Mail, added: 'We decided we'd rather try and educate people about the disease than get angry or upset at what they say.' The years of painstaking care have meant Jack has been able to start at nursery and is due to start school next year . The condition is caused by damage in a gene children are born with. This . gene controls the formation of a protein in the skin and without it the . skin rejects certain types of cells resulting in flaking, red skin. Jack, who was born five weeks premature by emergency Caesarean weighing 4lbs 5oz, spent the first six months of his life in hospital with doctors and . nurses keeping him isolated from any infections and diseases that could . easily penetrate his fragile skin. Before he was one year old, he had contracted MRSA, suffered blood . poisoning, septicaemia and bronchitis, and his heart had stopped three . times. But years of painstaking care have meant Jack, now aged three, has been able to start at nursery and is due to start school next year. Danny, whose wife had lost two babies to miscarriage and one ectopic pregnancy before Jack arrived, said: 'He just loves it. His time . there has to be very controlled but he is making friends. 'I went into the school to do a talk to educate people more about why . Jack looks like he does, as soon as I'd done that everyone wanted to be . his friends. 'He's special to the other kids so they all wanted to know . more about him.' The family have appealed for more people who have the condition so that further research can be carried out. There is currently no known cure  for the life-threatening disease but there are several things that can be done to relieve the symptoms such as moisturising, using anti-infective treatments and topical steroids.

According to a an NRAO statement, it was Heidi Winter, the executive assistant to the group's director, who saw a the photo of W50 and likened it to a manatee, which is often seen floating on its back, exposing its flippers. And the name has certainly stuck. Crystal River's National Wildlife refuge is home to the largest natural congregation of the bumbling creatures, which are also known as sea cows, in Florida. The herbivorous manatee averages about 10 feet long and can weigh around 1000 pounds. They are most often found floating in the warm, coastal waters off the coast of the Southeastern United States.

A Champions League game in England has been implicated in a huge European match fixing investigation. European police agency Europol has uncovered more than 380 suspicious matches in 15 countries, including a Champions League game played in England in the last three or four years. The specific match cannot be named for legal reasons, but only six English teams - Manchester United, Arsenal, Liverpool, Tottenham, Manchester City and Chelsea - have competed in the Champions League in that time. Investigated: Champions League games, including one in England, are under scrutiny . The mystery surrounding the . match-fixing investigation deepened after it emerged neither the . Football Association nor UEFA were aware of any such probe. Rob Wainwright, director of Europol - . the European Union's law enforcement agency, told a news conference that . the match which took place 'in the last three to four years' was one of . 380 under investigation. Europol said a total of 425 match . officials, club officials, players, and serious criminals are suspected . of being involved in attempts to fix matches. Wainwright refused to name which . English Champions League match in particular due to 'ongoing judicial . proceedings' - and the FA, which as the governing body in the country . should be alerted, is also at a loss to know which one. Manchester United played Braga at Old Trafford in December. There is no suggestion this game was involved in the investigation. A spokesman for The Football . Association said: 'The FA are not aware of any credible reports into . suspicious Champions League fixtures in England, nor has any information . been shared with us. 'While the Champions League comes . under UEFA jurisdiction, The FA, alongside the Premier League, Football . League and Conference, monitor markets for the top seven leagues and . three major cup competitions in England and take matters of integrity in . football extremely seriously.' It is understood UEFA is similarly unaware of an investigation into an Champions League match in England. A Europol spokesman said he was unable to comment when asked why neither the FA nor UEFA had been informed. Man City played Real Madrid at the Etihad in November. There is no suggestion that this game was involved in the investigation . Investigators told the news conference . an Asia-based crime syndicate is behind the fixing of the 380 matches, . along with World Cup and European Championship qualifiers and 'several . top football matches in European leagues'. Wainwright said at a press conference . in The Hague: 'This is the work of a suspected organised crime syndicate . based in Asia and operated with criminal networks around Europe. 'It is clear to us this is the . biggest-ever investigation into suspected match-fixing in Europe. It has . yielded major results which we think have uncovered a big problem for . the integrity of football in Europe.' Wainwright revealed the scale of the . corruption in Germany, where £13.8 million was wagered on matches in the . country with payments of £1.73m believed to have been paid to those . involved. Overall, Europol claim match-fixing had taken place in 15 countries with 50 people arrested to date. Liverpool played Fiorentina at Anfield in December 2009. There is no suggestion this game was involved in the investigation . Wainwright added: 'The focus has been . on other countries, not the United Kingdom. However we were surprised by . the scale generally of the criminal enterprise and just how widespread . it was. 'It would be naive and complacent of . those in the UK to think such a criminal conspiracy does not involve the . English game and all the football in Europe.' UEFA confirmed it would co-operate with the investigation and stressed it had a zero-tolerance approach to match-fixing. It added in a statement: 'UEFA is . aware of the statements made by Europol regarding the alleged . match-fixing that has taken place in various football competitions, and . expects to receive further information in the coming days. 'As part of the fight against the . manipulation of matches, UEFA is already co-operating with the . authorities on these serious matters as part of its zero tolerance . policy towards match-fixing in our sport. Chelsea played Barcelona at Stamford Bridge in April. There is no suggestion that this game was involved in the investigation. Conference: Britain's Rob Wainwright, left, speaks on the findings of the match fixing probe . 'Once the details of these . investigations are in UEFA's hands, then they will be reviewed by the . appropriate disciplinary bodies in order that the necessary measures are . taken.' FIFA's head of security Ralf Mutschke said prison sentences for fixing needed to be tougher. He said: 'In football, a national . association can sanction a member of the football family if they are . found guilty of contravening the legal, football framework. 'FIFA's disciplinary code provides the opportunity to extend those sanctions, and impose a life ban. Tottenham played Inter Milan at White Hart Lane in November 2010. There is no suggestion this game was involved in the investigation . 'But for people outside of football, . currently the custodial sentences imposed are too weak, and offer little . to deter someone from getting involved in match-fixing.' Meanwhile, the Danish FA has banned a player for six months for placing bets on a 2011 cup match he played in.

A new policy at the popular pharmacy chain CVS is causing outrage after the company announced it will require its employees to report their weight, BMI, and glucose levels – or pay a hefty fine. CVS Caremark, which is based in Rhode Island, has some 200,000 employees. The controversial new policy would require workers to sign a waiver that they ‘voluntarily’ disclosed the information, but those who opt out must pay a $600 fee. Patient advocate groups say this is just another coercive measure and worry that those employees in poorer health might risk getting fired. Disclosure: CVS Caremark has announced a controversial new policy that would require its 200,000 employees to disclose their height, weight, and other vital stats . The company mandated that all of its employees must get the screenings, which include their height, weight, body mass index, blood pressure levels, and glucose levels, by May 1, according to the Boston Herald. CVS added that they will cover the cost of these screenings. But that comes at a price – those who have their tests covered by the company are required to sign a waiver saying the screenings were voluntary. If workers refuse to sign up, they will be charged an extra $50 a month, or $600 a year. However, the policy has been called ‘technology-enhanced discrimination’ by Dr Deborah Peel, the founder of Patient Privacy Rights. She told ABC News that the policy insinuates that workers need to be penalized in order to get into shape. 'The approach they’re taking is based on the assumption that somehow these people need a whip,' she said. ‘How is it voluntary if you are a low or medium-wage person?’ she told the Herald. Manipulative? Patient advocate groups say this is just another coercive measure and worry that those employees in poorer health might risk getting fired . Representatives for CVS did not immediately respond to MailOnline’s request for comment on the policy, but released a statement saying they wanted their employees to be 'as healthy as they can be.' The statement continues: 'Many companies around the country already have plans similar to the one we are implementing. In fact, 79 percent of large employers have health assessments incorperated into their programs.' 'The approach CVS is taking is based on the assumption that somehow these people need a whip.' -Dr Deborah Peel, Patient Privacy Rights founder . Healthcare costs have been rising at an alarming rate in the U.S., inflated by expensive premiums, high co-pays, and high deductibles. Meanwhile, it was reported yesterday that CVS’ CEO Larry Merlo’s pay has skyrocked to $18million, up from $12million the year before. According to WPRI.com, Merlo’s comprehensive pay package included a $6.4million bonus, as well as $10.3million in stock options. CVS spokesperson Mike DeAngelis told the website via email that the pay increase was entirely merited, as the company ‘continued to deliver strong financial results and enhanced returns to shareholders.’ He added: ‘Mr Merlo’s compensation in 2012 reflects these strong suits.’ We want to help our employees to be as healthy as they can be, which is why we decided to implement this plan. In fact, we have been working for a number of years on ways they can improve their health through preventive measures. Healthcare programs that incent employees to be healthier are not new. Many companies around the country already have plans similar to the one we are implementing. In fact, 79% of large employers have health assessments incorporated into their programs. To encourage a higher level of participation in our wellness review, we reviewed best practices and determined that an additional cost for those who do not complete the review was the most effective way to incent our colleagues to improve their health care and manage health costs. CVS Caremark is committed to providing medical coverage and healthcare programs for our colleagues and privacy is rigorously protected, consistent with HIPAA regulations. All personal health data from these screenings are collected and reviewed by a third-party administrator that supports the CVS Caremark Wellness Program, and this data is not shared with CVS Caremark — rather it is designed to help employees make the best decisions about their own healthcare.","CVS Caremark will enforce new policy that requires its 200,000 employees to report their height, weight, body mass index, blood glucose levels, and other vital stats .

A self-styled nun who sent envelopes containing white powder to top politicians including deputy PM Nick Clegg was spared jail today. ‘Sister’ Ruth Augustus, 72, scrawled bizarre slogans about devil worship and freemasonry on the six letters before posting them. When they were intercepted at a mail screening centre staff found them stuffed with a gritty white powder initially believed to be anthrax. One envelope addressed to Mr Clegg had ‘devil worshipping’, ‘freemason’ and ‘your poor Catholic wife and children’ written on it. Augustus also wrote ‘sex with 30 plus women’ on the letter - a reference to a boast in an interview with Mr Clegg about his bedroom prowess. Another letter sent to former Labour Home Office minister Baroness Scotland was daubed with a swastika and two crosses and read ‘stop this evil devil worshipping’. A third, sent to barrister and Labour peer Baroness Kennedy, also featured a swastika and the slogan: ‘Stop these evil devil worshipping freemasons’. Augustus claimed the powder had been planted by the police but was convicted of plotting the hoaxes after a trial at Harrow Crown Court. When she appeared at the Old Bailey to be sentenced she demanded to be addressed as ‘Sister Ruth’, bellowing from the dock: ‘I am a Catholic nun’. The judge, Mr Justice Saunders, said the pensioner from Leyton, east London would normally have been sent to prison for her antics. Bizarre: Both Baroness Scotland, left and Deputy Prime . Minster Nick Clegg were sent envelopes containing white powder. Addressed to Mr Clegg, the envelope had 'devil worshipping' written on . the outside . But instead he handed her a two-year . community order requiring her to be treated for mental health problems, . including a persistent delusional disorder. She is already subject to a restraining order banning her from contacting MPs. The judge told her: ‘The white powder was in fact harmless but the recipients would not have known that. ‘Had they opened the letters and found the powder there can be no doubt it would have been a terrifying experience for them, not knowing what the powder was contained in those envelopes.’ Augustus, who attended court in a dress bearing a picture of former slave and Catholic Saint Josephine Bakhita and pulling a shopping trolley adorned with plastic flowers and a Union Jack, repeatedly interrupted proceedings. Targets: Sister Ruth Augustus also sent envelopes to Baroness Kennedy and Edward Leigh MP . After she was sentenced she told the judge: ‘My father fought Hitler but he shouldn’t have bothered. ‘It’s run by devil-worshipping freemason Nazis already, who break the law at huge expense.’ She added that she would be taking her case to the European Court in Strasbourg. The first batch of letters was . discovered at a mail screening centre in east London on June 17 last . year when a worker raised concerns. The envelopes contained a gritty . substance which was first believed to be anthrax but tested negative and . was found to be non-hazardous. Scare: The envelopes contained a gritty substance, but it was found they had already tested negative for anthrax (file photo) More envelopes were unearthed on October 1 at the same centre, addressed to Mr Clegg, Baroness Kennedy and Tory MP Edward Leigh. Augustus was arrested at a hotel where she was staying on December 7 and her room searched.It was then that two other guests came forward to say they too had received offensive letters from her. One was accused of being a ‘drunken prostitute’ and another made derogatory remarks about the recipient’s Somali heritage. When Augustus was interviewed by police about the letter to Mr Clegg, she said he had ‘lied about all the tuition fees and everything else, keeping those Tory millionaires and rats in government’. She added: ‘He boasted about all the women he’s had sex with. He’s an atheist singing hymns in the Albert Hall.’ During today’s hearing, Augustus asked court staff whether they could hear ticking coming from her trolley and asked members of the press in court to put her on page three of The Sun. She continues to maintain the powder was planted in the envelopes by police but was convicted of six counts of hoaxes involving a noxious substance and two counts of harassment.","'Sister' Ruth Augustus scrawled bizarre messages such as 'devil worshipping' on the letters posted to top politicians .

"By . Michael Zennie and Meghan Keneally . UPDATED: . 12:23 EST, 9 February 2012 . A veteran TV anchor in Denver, Colorado, was rushed to the hospital and underwent reconstructive surgery after a dog that appeared on her morning show bit her in the face during a live TV segment. Max, an 85-pound Argentine Mastiff, sunk his teeth into Kyle Dyer's face when she bent down to pet him Wednesday morning during a morning show segment on KUSA-TV. Ms Dyer, who had been working at the station for over 15 years, had reconstructive surgery on Wednesday and is going to be out for several weeks while she recovers. Scroll down for video (Warning: Graphic content) On TV: Kyle Dyer, right, had knelt down to pet Max when he attacked. He is seen here with his owner, Michael Robinson, and the firefighter that rescued him . Attack: In a flash, Max bares his teeth and lashes out at Ms Dyers face. Animal control officers called it a 'pretty major bite.' The dog, whose full name is Warrior Maximus, . recently survived a harrowing rescue from a freezing pond and was on . the show as part of a mini-reunion between him and his rescuers. 'I know that she is a great journalist . who loves happy stories - this was a happy story,' her co-anchor Gary . Shapiro said in a note to fans. The station's news chopper captured . video footage of a firefighter rescuing Max from a freezing pond Monday . after he fell through the ice and couldn't make it out. 'Kyle was glad she got assigned to it, because she loves animals,' Mr Shapiro said. 'Max and his owner spent about 45 . minutes in the newsroom before they went on the air, and many members of . the staff greeted them and petted Max. He seemed perfectly normal. 'During the interview Kyle petted . him, and talked to the two guest. At the very end of the segment, Max . snapped at Kyle for whatever reason and got some of her lip.' Bitten: Ms Dyer was rushed to the local hospital in Denver and has been examined by a trauma team to determine how to repair the damage to her face . Fined: Max was locked up for observation because he didn't have rabies shots and his owner was fined by animal control officers . Now, Max has been caged by animal control officers and his owner, Michael Robinson has been fined. The station says Miss Dyer, who is . married and is a mother, is in fair condition, recovering from the bite . at at Denver hospital. Argentine mastiffs, also known as the Argentine Dogo, are known as big-game hunters and historically have gone after wild boars and pumas. While they are now used as pets, they were bred from a rather violent group of dogs. The breed first appeared in 1928 as a relative of the Cordoba Fighting Dog. The dogs are very possessive and protect both their physical territory and their owners by using their strength and sharp teeth. Because of the dogs' violent nature, several areas have banned the breed, including Aurora, Colorado. Aurora is the neighbouring city to Denver, where the broadcast took place. The animal is also banned in New York City public housing, and laws in the UK allow police to take the dogs away from their owners and prosecute them. A trauma team is evaluating the injuries to her face. Mr Robinson says he was walking Max Monday when he saw a coyote and ran off after it. Authorities . say Max spend 20 minutes swimming in the pond before a firefighter in a . dry suit dove into the frigid waters and pulled him to safety. The TV station aired the harrowing rescue and invited the firefighter, Mr Robinson and Max into their studios Wednesday morning for a reunion. That's when Max attacked Ms Dyer. The station says the attack was not broadcast, but it later released a short clip of the bite. Denver Animal Control Director Doug Kelley told CBS4 Denver Ms Dyer's injury was 'a pretty major bite.' Station executives confirmed that Ms Dyer was out of surgery at around 2pm Wednesday. 'She's . doing well, and will make a recovery, and we're all thinking about her . and her family,' said 9News vice president Patti Dennis. 'Kyle- . of all people!- is the biggest dog lover and even yesterday we were . talking about how, as dog lovers, we think every dog belongs to us. 'Kyle will be back in a period of weeks- probably several but she will be back.' Max, who did not have proper rabies vaccinations, will be quarantined 10 days to ensure he is healthy. Mr Johnson was cited for a dog bite violation, having the dog off his leash and not having proper vaccinations. When Mr Shapiro posted his lengthy . update on Ms Dyer's condition on the station's Facebook page, fans and . viewers responded with 928 'likes' to the fact that she was recovering . and doing well. There were also 451 comments, and . while there certainly were a significant amount of well-wishers, there . was also a surprising number of angry respondents who were siding with . the dog. 'I totally agree with all those saying it was her own fault and she should have known better,' wrote Cassandra Hughes Kramer. 'The dog was being a dog, defending . itself in a stressful situation. He didn't jump on her and maul her, he . nipped her lip....and she shouldn't have been trying to kiss him. Maybe . it's a hard lesson to learn, but hopefully she learned it.' Treatment: Ms Dyer is now recovering after surgery Wednesday afternoon at Denver Health Medical Center . Part of the team: Ms Dyer (right) has been working for the station for over 15 years, many of which she has co-anchored with Gary Shapiro (left) 'Kyle was glad she got assigned to it, because she loves animals,' Mr Shapiro said . Others were extremely upset at the thought of the dog being put down- which has not been formally suggested- and said that the station should ensure that does not happen. 'It was clearly human fault. Why should the animal be blamed for both the owner an kyle's mistake?Hope he isn't put down, it would be a crime,' wrote Bruno Naletto. Brendan Flynn echoed that sentiment, writing: 'Lord knows 9News will hear from all of us and alot more if Max is put down.'

A three year old girl died in a house fire made worse by piles of clutter which set alight and created toxic smoke that overwhelmed her. Amelia Brown was in a first floor bedroom of her home in Grinacombe Moor near Lifton, Devon, when the house caught fire last December. Firefighters were beaten back by the fierce blaze which melted the plastic visors of their helmets and they were unable to recover the little girl’s body until the next day. Tragic: Three-year-old Amelia Brown died in the house fire fuelled by piles of clutter strewn around her family home, an inquest heard . Clutter: The fire, started in the kitchen, was 'accelerated' by the hoards of combustible furniture, clothes and bric-a-brac . An inquest in Bideford, Devon, heard the cottage had been full of clutter much of which belonged to her grandmother Stephanie Brown and that smoke alarms were not fitted in the house. Mrs Brown owned the property, which was full of clothes and furniture, but lived across the road. Det Sgt Barry Mitchell said: 'I saw an . extraordinary amount of hoarding and rubbish. It would have made moving . around the property very difficult and would have made what I would call . normal living activity virtually impossible.' Amelia's grandfather David, who was babysitting managed to escape but she was overcome by fumes and died of smoke inhalation . Devon and Somerset Fire service investigator George Setter said doors could not be closed because of clutter and that Amelia’s door could not be closed because of clothes, household goods and material in the way. He said: ‘The unusually excessive amount of combustible materials’ led to the fierce fire which generated large amounts of toxic smoke affecting all parts of the property’. Mrs Brown, in her 60s, admitted the . property was cluttered saying: 'I’m a great one for make do and mend. While it may have looked shabby, it was functional.' Her . late husband David had been babysitting while Amelia's mother . Abigail was out at a pre-school fundraiser that evening and she added: 'Amelia . was everything to Abigail. We all doted on her. 'She was a non stop . bundle of energy, very curious and always asked questions, very eager to . learn . 'But she also loved dressing up, . dancing and singing. She loved flowers and animals and died with her pet . cat who she had only had for a month but she really loved him. 'Everyone did what they could but it . all happened so quickly. We have been told that anyone who suffers smoke . inhalation is not aware of it. It is very quick and very gentle and we . take some small comfort in the fact that Amelia will not have suffered.' Mrs Brown said they will probably never know what sparked the fire which is thought to have started in the kitchen. The inquest into her death heard there was so much junk that some internal doors could not be closed, including the one in Amelia's bedroom . She said: 'There were no naked flames . or electrical appliances left on. We did not have smoke detectors but . neither do many old cottages. 'We will never forget the beautiful, bright little girl who never stopped telling us she loved us.' Deputy Devon coroner John Tomalin said Amelia died from smoke inhalation and recorded an accidental death verdict. He said: 'It’s accepted by all that there was a large number of items in each room. This was to the extent that internal doors could not be closed.'","Doors in house could not be closed because of clutter in the way .

A man has died during an early morning trip with friends after his kayak capsized on a Scottish loch early today. The coastguard received an emergency call reporting that one of a party of three kayakers was in the water at Loch Fyne in Argyll. A rescue helicopter was scrambled and the men were picked up by a lifeboat and taken to Mid Argyll Hospital in Lochgilphead, where the man died. Tragedy: Loch Fyne in Argyll, Scotland, not far from where I kayaker died following an early morning trip out on the water . He is believed to be in his 20s. His family have been told. Belfast Coastguard received the 999 call at 6am from one of the three men to report that one of their party was in the water and that they needed assistance. The RNLI inshore lifeboat from Tighnabruaich was launched and the Coastguard search and rescue helicopter from Stornoway was scrambled. Although coastguards said the wind was northerly force five and there was moderate visibility at the time, it is thought the weather conditions were not considered dangerous enough for warnings. Weather warnings for people taking to the water are usually issued at force six, with five being described by the Beaufort Scale as winds of between 18 and 24 mph, with waves reaching anywhere from six to nine feet.

Life imprisonment: Muhammad Shafi has been for a minimum of 23 years after he was found guilty of bludgeoning his wife to death . A newlywed who bludgeoned his Thai bride to death in an underpass after she questioned his sexuality has been jailed for life. Muhammad Shafi took a pair of . metal tin cutters and struck Tuanjai Sprengel nine . times over her head just five months after they got married. The 28-year-old defendant claimed he was branded homosexual by his wife, who also taunted him that she had slept with other men in a heated argument in which she attempted to walk away from their relationship. The pair had been arguing for more than a hour in the underpass in Bracknell, Berkshire, when  he armed himself and beat her to death. After the bloody killing, Shafi calmly . picked up the improvised weapon and threw it in some bushes as he walked . back to their rented home. A jury at Reading Crown Court heard how he cried in his bedroom as he sat in his bloodstained clothes, which he later tried to unsuccessfully hide with friends. Shafi tried to convince the jury that he . could not remember inflicting the fatal blows on his 43-year-old bride, who was . known to friends as 'Tuk.' The Pakistani national, who married mother-of-one . Tuk in an Islamic marriage in December last year, admitted hitting . her once in self-defence, claiming she had pulled a kitchen knife and the tin cutters . on him. However, prosecutor Alan Blake . rejected this account and maintained Shafi had taken the weapons to an . underpass in order to kill her.

Amjad Malik QC, defending, told the judge: 'It was a violent and sudden loss of temper. 'This is a man with no previous convictions. He is emotionally naive and emotionally weak for a 28-year-old man.' Speaking of the homosexual . allegations made by Tuk, the defendant told the jury during . the hearing: 'She was my wife and I loved her very much and I did not . expect it from her. I had opposed all my family to marry her. Scene of the crime: The underpass where Shafi struck her over the head with tin cutters nine times leaving her for dead . 'I’m a Muslim.

Days before her tragic death, Tuk . confided in a pal that Shafi had asked her to have a threesome with him . and that he had become enraged when she refused. Shafi, who was in the UK on a student visa, has refuted any suggestion of this ever happening, the jury was told .

Killjoy council chiefs have been branded scrooges after they banned SpongeBob Squarepants from turning on the Christmas  lights - because of health and safety fears. Hundreds of children were left in tears when officials ruled the yellow costume of the children’s TV favourite was too wide to walk up five steps on to a platform. Around 2,000 people, many families with young children, turned out to Wolverhampton’s Market Square, West Midlands, on Friday night, last week, expecting to see the cartoon character switch on the Christmas lights. Killjoys: SpongeBob Squarepants walks around at ground level under the stage meaning he could only be seen by people at the front of the crowd . Wolverhampton City Council forked out £2,000 on hiring the SpongeBob Squarepants costume but officials banned it from both the platform and the back of a float which was due to carry it around town. The character was only allowed to walk around at ground level under the stage meaning he could only be seen by people at the front of the crowd. Yesterday furious parents blasted the ruling - branding the council 'health and safety scrooges.' John Williamson, 45, from Wolverhampton, said his nine-year-old daughter Lola was reduced to tears after she was unable to see her idol. Disappointment: Hundreds of children were left in tears when cartoon character SpongeBob was banned from turning on the festive lights . Children's favourite: The character has become a huge hit with children after he first made an appearance on our screens in 2000 . He stormed: 'It’s ridiculous to ban a children’s character from a Christmas lights switch on. 'You would hope the council wouldn’t be such health and safety scrooges and let the kids have a good look at their character. 'Lola had been talking about seeing Spongebob Squarepants for days but was inconsolable when she couldn’t even get a glimpse of him.' SpongeBob Squarepants had been expected to switch on the lights alongside Corrie star Sherrie Hewson but the soap actress was forced to press the button on her own. Switched on: Star of Coronation Street and Loose Women, Sherrie Hewson, was forced to turn the lights on by herself after SpongeBob getting on stage was considered a health and safety risk . Schoolgirl Jessica Drew, 10, who went along with her guide group to watch the lights, said: 'The fireworks were really good and we enjoyed it but we were disappointed that we didn’t see SpongeBob. 'We just thought that he hadn’t turned up because we never saw him once. There was no sign of him on stage at all.' Yesterday the council stood by the health and safety ruling. Mark Blackstock, outdoor events manager for the council, said: 'Unfortunately, the character actor playing SpongeBob Squarepants was unable to climb the stairs on to the stage because of his costume. 'Health and safety considerations meant we were unable to lift him on to the stage using the tailgate of one of our vehicles because of the high numbers of people around the stage. 'This meant that SpongeBob Squarepants was unable to appear on stage during the event. 'As the actor could only be permitted to stay in his suit for 40 minutes at a time, again for health and safety reasons, we arranged the two 40-minute meet and greet sessions to enable the public to see him close up. 'During this time, he met as many young fans as possible at both locations, though we of course apologise to anyone who couldn’t see him on stage and was unable to meet him in person.' It is not the first time the council has left children in tears after imposing strict rules on kiddy’s characters. In 2010 Peppa Pig caused a stir when the person wearing the costume had to restrict meetings with youngsters over fears she would overheat in her suit. Staff even offered to don the suit themselves after the actor said she had gone overtime, to avoid the scenes of disappointed children and parents, but were told they could not take over.","Wolverhampton City Council forked out £2,000 on the costume before deciding it was too wide to walk up five steps to the platform .

Cyber crime: Facebook helped the FBI bust an international hacking ring that infected 11million computers and stole over £525million from users . Facebook has helped the FBI to bust an international hacking ring that stole more than £525million from unsuspecting computer users. The gang are said to have infected 11million computers with spyware that stole credit card numbers and bank details to net one of the largest cybercrime hauls in history. They used 'Yahos' malicious software to steal the financial details and other personal information. Ten suspects have been arrested by FBI agents in connection with the hacking. One of the people in custody lives in Molesey, in Surrey. The social networking site's security team helped the agents snare the gang after 'Yahos' targeted its users between 2010 and October 2012, the agency said in a statement. They were able to help identify the criminals and spot affected accounts. Its 'security systems were able to detect affected accounts and provide tools to remove these threats', the FBI said. According to the agency, which worked also with the U.S. Department of Justice, the accused hackers employed the 'Butterfly Botnet'. Botnets are networks of infected computers that can be used in a variety of cyberattacks on personal computers and legitimate online networks and websites. 'Security systems': Facebook's security team helped the FBI after the so-called 'Yahos' malware targeted its users between 2010 and October 2012, the FBI said in a statement . A botnet is a collection of internet-connected computers over which a hacker has seized control. Each compromised machine - known as a 'bot' - is created when a computer is infected with malicious software (malware) which allows the hacker to direct its activities remotely. These infections can be accomplished by luring users into making a drive-by download, exploiting web browser vulnerabilities, or by tricking the user into running a Trojan horse program, which may come from via email. This malware will typically install modules that allow the computer to be commanded and controlled by the botnet's operator. The FBI said it arrested 10 suspects from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, New Zealand, Peru, the UK, and the U.S. The agency also executed numerous search warrants and conducted a raft of interviews, it said. It estimated the total losses from their activities at more than $850m (£525m), without elaborating. Hard data is tough to come by, but experts say cybercrime is on the rise around the world as PC and mobile computing become more prevalent and as more and more financial transactions shift online. Because of the global networks of criminals involved and the remote nature of the crimes, police, cybersecurity professionals and targeted corporations increasingly hard-pressed to spot and ward off attacks. The FBI's release recommended users to update their operating systems and applications regularly, use anti-virus software and disconnect computers from the Internet when not in use to ward off future cyber attacks.","Hackers distributed malware which stole credit card numbers and bank details, agency says .

The cost of paying gold-plated pensions to Britain’s public sector workers will balloon by nearly 60 per cent over the next five years, official forecasts revealed this week. Experts warned it makes a mockery of the Government’s claim to have tackled the problem of the crippling cost of paying such generous pensions to the State workforce. Under the deal, hammered out by ministers, public sector workers will have to work longer and pay more for their pensions and many will get less when they retire. Contentious: Last year ministers managed to force public sector workers to work longer and get less money for retirement, leading to a strike, but they remain some of the most generous pensions in the country . But they remain among the most generous retirement payouts in the country, according to the forecast from the Government’s independent financial watchdog published this week. Between April 2012 and April 2013, the cost of paying the pensions of retired NHS workers, teachers, civil servants and the Armed Forces is £8.9billion. But this figure is set to rocket to £14.1billion five years later in the year 2017/18, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility. This is an increase of 58 per cent. To make matters worse, this is not even the full cost to the taxpayer of paying the pensions of all retired public sector workers. It does not include the cost of paying the pensions of many other types of State workers, such as the police, firefighters, MPs and local government workers. And the OBR’s analysis, published in the Budget’s so-called Red Book, does not even include the full cost to the taxpayer of paying the pensions it does include. This is because it deducts the amount contributed by the employer into their workers’ pensions - but the ‘employer’ is the State, paid for by taxpayers. Lord Oakeshott, a leading LibDem lord and a former pensions spokesman, said: ‘Public sector pensions costs are due to rise by an eye-watering amount every year. ‘Meanwhile private sector pensions are being squeezed and the Bank of England’s quantitative easing programme is hammering annuity rates for private savers. ‘Our coalition Government has only half defused the ticking public sector pensions time bomb Labour left us.’ Time bomb: Lord Matthew Oakeshott said that Labour had left behind 'eye-watering' public sector rises while private sector pensions are being squeezed . It comes as gold-plated pensions in the private sector are being shut down at the fastest rate on record, according to the National Association of Pension Funds.In 2005, 43 per cent of defined benefit schemes allowed new recruits to a company to join. Today the figure has collapsed to just 13 per cent following the biggest-ever drop last year.A defined benefit pension promises to pay a worker a certain pension when they retire, typically linked to their final salary or their average salary over their career.Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, the campaign group, said: ‘The growing burden of public sector pensions shows little sign of slowing despite government promises of reform.‘Unions have vociferously resisted even moderate reforms and it is taxpayers who are paying the price for that.‘We’re all living longer, and this bill isn’t getting any smaller.’ It comes as unions are plotting strike action over changes to their pensions as well as other grievances.Members of the militant Public and Commercial Services union walking out on Budget Day and teachers will walk out later this year.The Treasury says the Government’s reforms will save billions of pounds over the next few decades and have put public service pensions onto a sustainable footing.","Public sector payouts will remain among the most generous in the country .

"By . Jan Moir . PUBLISHED: . 21:09 EST, 22 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 21:16 EST, 22 March 2013 . A few years ago, I said to my mother: ‘I want to start knitting again.’ ‘What do you mean, again?’ she replied, looking panicky. Decades may have passed, but both of us remembered the horror of my primary school knitting classes. The bad report cards, the black marks for misbehaving, the tearful trudge home with some misshapen  disaster, a woolly testament to my shame  and ineptitude. ‘We’ll give it to charity,’ mother would say, folding the unspeakable item in a drawer, never to be seen again. Oh, how I hated knitting  back then, the wool squeaky and tight with  flop sweat, the impenetrable instructions, the endless plain and purling. Great fun: You can knit all sorts of creative things, such as this fried breakfast created in wool by Designer Kate Jenkins in Brighton . All that agony, for what? A grimy egg cosy at the end of term. A pair of mittens that appeared to have been mauled by kittens. Bah. I didn’t give knitting another thought for the next 30 or so years. Then something happened to reawaken the woolly beast within. I really don’t know what. Perhaps it is just that I adore hand-knitted things; the simple beauty of moss stitch, the triumph of a home-made bobble hat, the love and care that goes into every cosy inch of baby’s first jumper or a pair of booties or a scarf for a friend. In a world of fast and cheap fashion, of disposable clothes and gimcrack home-wares, knitting stands apart as something special: custom made, hand-crafted, rather beautiful and created by not much more than a pair of human hands and a bit of application. Could I do it myself? I certainly wanted to try. And that’s when I discovered that knitting had changed. For a start, bamboo needles! Holy clickety-clack, who knew that needles had now been invented which made knitting easier and smoother for even the worst bungling amateur? Also, knitting was no longer the sole preserve of the happily retired or the elderly, those dedicated few whipping up lacy sherbet lemon bed jackets or scratchy jumpers that no one wanted to wear.According to Deramores, one of the country’s biggest online retailers of all your knitting needs, the number of UK knitters has risen to more than 6.5 million since the recession hit in 2008. Of that number, 70 per cent are  aged 45-plus — although there is a  growing surge in popularity among younger people. Adorable: Nothing is more calming and fulfilling than knitting presents . With a wealth of beautiful patterns for covetable things, amazing yarns and even celebrity followers, knitting has come in from the cold. Now, to encourage this renaissance, the Mail is giving readers a brilliant, free step-by-step beginner’s guide, starting today with a 32-page booklet and followed by seven collectable glossy pattern cards. The guide includes basic techniques, advice about choosing yarns and gorgeous patterns for super-cute babies’ bonnets and booties, a chic cardigan, a colourful bobble hat and — for him — a fine-knit sweater and very smart scarf. Hollywood actresses such as Julia Roberts, Kristin Davis and Sarah Jessica Parker are all keen knitters, while Uma Thurman, Geri Halliwell and even Madonna have all been seen busy with their own knitting projects. British knitty celebrities such as TV presenters Kirstie Allsopp and Anthea Turner have also done their bit to popularise the craft. Keen knitter: Kirsty Allsop has been spotted busy with her knitting projects . This is all a reflection of a broader cultural shift, too. Not so long ago, knitting was frowned upon by feminists, who saw it as a symbol of female oppression and subjugation. If men weren’t knitting tea cosies and tank-tops, then why the hell were we? Yet over the past 20 years, the notion that to knit is somehow to demean oneself as a feminist crusader has itself become an anachronism. Also, as more and more people turned towards growing their own vegetables, to bottling preserves and jams and to take pleasure in baking and cooking, knitting also found a new place at the table.Why not? For knitting is creative and productive. The first time I knitted a hat, an actual wearable hat that someone could put on their head and walk down the street in without getting arrested, was one of the most thrilling moments of my life. Like many, I am indebted to a new generation of knitting writers who not only produce wonderful, irresistible patterns for knitters of all abilities, but guide you from casting-on to the very last stitch.Bibs, toys, cute accessories, cashmere jumpers you’d actually want to wear, star-patterned baby blankets? It is all out there, begging to be knitted up. Step by step, I learned that knitting is nothing to fear. Also that natural wool is a beautiful thing — and a very forgiving medium to work in. As Julia Roberts says, there is nothing more satisfying than turning a pile of yarn into a garment or a gift. Wholesome fun: Prince Harry as imagined in the hit Knit Your Own Royal Wedding book by Fiona Goble . Of course, I could never be in my mother’s knitting league. She is  one of that generation of British women who learned to knit as a matter of course. She baulks at nothing; impenetrable cable jumpers, the terrifying procedure known as ‘pick up and knit’, French knots, Swiss stitch, turning a heel? She can do the lot, without taking her eyes off Emmerdale. Years ago, she knitted enough jumpers, hats and scarves to kit out our family. We just took it for granted. Now I can only gasp in admiration at her — and millions of women like her —  who possess these remarkable skills. Two years ago, like thousands of Mail readers, Mum and I became obsessed with Fiona Goble’s  hilarious pattern book, Knit The Royal Family. It had detailed instructions on how to knit all the most important guests at the  wedding of Prince William and the then Kate Middleton — right down to the liveried footmen in their breeches and even the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan  Williams, complete with wispy mohair beard. The £9.99 paperback had initially sold just over 800 copies, yet after being featured in the Mail, it became a smash, selling more than 50,000 copies in the weeks before the wedding. It said something wonderful about the Mail’s knitty readership. Just give us the opportunity to knit a diddy-sized Prince Philip in 44 yards of beige double-knit yarn, complete with gold buttons and a gilt embossed hat, and we are there quicker than you can say: ‘Have I made his eyes too slitty?’ Knitted gift: Prince Charles is chuffed on a trip to Cumbria with his handmade present . Since then, I’ve moved on. Oh yes. I’ve knitted dogs (there are instructions in the Mail’s step-by-step beginner’s guide to make a cute Dachshund). A pair of striped baby socks. I think I mentioned my hat. A Father Christmas, complete with sack of toys. Oh yes. I’ve gained in confidence. I’ve learned that knitting is oddly relaxing. To focus on something small, like getting to the end of a row without making a mistake, is almost like meditating. There is a kind of sanctuary about it. Knitters take refuge in repetition and numbers, and the consoling knowledge that it’s not a pointless pastime, it is a proper craft that will produce something lovely at the end. Also it is good to know that learning to knit, or trying to improve one’s knitting skills, is an easily achievable goal. It’s not like learning French or taking up the clarinet. It’s easy! Sooner than you know it, you will be crossing the line between hesitant beginner and fluid, expert knitter. Ahem, no, I haven’t quite got there myself yet. In fact, I haven’t quite got around to knitting anything bigger than a beany hat. But knit-wise, you just never know what might happen next.","Celebrity knitters Kirsty Allsop Julia Roberts and Madonna are leading the charge .

Jailed: Tracey Connelly, mother of abused toddler Baby Peter, is understood to be working as a hairdresser in Low Newton women's prison Durham . The mother of Baby P has angered fellow inmates after being given a job as a hairdresser in jail. Tracey Connelly will be given a pair of scissors and allowed to work on other criminals at Low Newton women's prison in Durham, according to reports. Connelly, who was jailed for five years in 2009 over the death of her son Peter, is understood to be getting paid for the role. The 31-year-old was labelled 'manipulative, self-centred and calculating' during her trial in the Old Bailey. Connelly viciously attacked two of her children and did nothing while Peter was tortured to death by her boyfriend Steven Barker and his brother Jason Owen. Inmates at the prison told The Sun that many prisoners had 'refused to get their hair done by her'. They added: 'Connelly has been given . one of the most coveted jobs inside prison. She's been working in the . prison hair salon and earns a small wage in return. 'But a lot of the girls feel she is living on easy street even though she helped end that poor kid's life.' The criminal's mother Mary also revealed that her daughter had gained a significant amount of weight while in prison and dyed her hair blonde. She said: 'She's put on an awful lot of weight and is now 22 stone. She has a double chin and a triple belly.' Peter Connelly was just 17 months old when he died in his mother's north London flat. Peter and his three sisters were sharing the four-bedroom house with their mother, her boyfriend  Barker, his paedophile brother Owen and his four children, plus Owen's 15-year-old girlfriend. Tortured: Baby P suffered a catalogue of abuse and was found to have a snapped back and broken ribs . At the trial, Connelly refused knowing who had caused the injuries to her son. Haringey Council's failure to investigate his mother's tissue of lies meant Peter and eight other children were left inside their squalid home in North London. Horrific: Paedophile Steven Barker was jailed for life for his role in Baby Peter's death . Peter suffered a catalogue of horrifying injuries including a broken spine, injured ribs and removed fingernails, which was missed by social service workers. Three of the children - Peter and two of his siblings - were on Haringey's Child Protection Register because of fears they were being neglected by their mother. Social workers, health visitors and doctors saw the family 60 times before 17-month-old Peter died from his horrific injuries. But shockingly none of these professionals realised that two men were living in the house, despite a family support official meeting 6ft 4in Barker during a home visit. Barker and Owen were both convicted of causing or allowing Peter's death after he was found in his blood-spattered cot on August 3, 2007. Barker was given a life sentence for the rape of the two-year-old, with a 20-year minimum. Connelly admitted allowing her son's death and was also given an indeterminate sentence. She was refused parole last year. Both she and Barker are expected to ask for new identities and police protection if they are released, at a potential cost to the taxpayer of more than £1million a year. A Prison Service spokesman said: 'We refuse to comment on individual prisoners.'","Tracey Connelly, 31, was jailed for five years for her role in Peter's death .

Jeremy Hunt is thought to have rejected the call for individuals to be subject to the duty of candour . Hospitals and GP surgeries that conceal mistakes that harm patients will be punished, under rules to be unveiled by the Health Secretary next week. The NHS will be subject to a new ‘duty of  candour’ – a key recommendation in the independent report on Mid-Staffordshire, where hundreds died due to appalling care. Robert Francis QC, the report’s author, called for a law to apply to both institutions and individuals such as doctors, nurses and managers. However, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is thought to have rejected the call for individuals to be subject to the duty of candour. Instead, NHS trusts and GP surgeries would be held responsible, and could face fines. Peter Walsh, chief executive of Action Against Medical Accidents – which has been campaigning for a statutory duty of candour for 30 years – said that, although it was disappointing the rule will not apply to staff themselves, it would still be ‘fundamental to changing the culture of the NHS’. He added: ‘A corporate duty would mean organisations would have to make it known to every single member of their staff. 'They would have to demonstrate where there were breaches [that] they had taken action.’ The NHS will be subject to a new ¿duty of candour¿ ¿ a key recommendation in the independent report on Mid-Staffordshire, where hundreds died due to appalling care . Don Redding of National Voices, which represents health and social care charities, said: ‘In cases where patients have been harmed or worse, both senior managers and their legal advisers have generally decided their first duty is to the interests of the trust. 'This new legal duty will rebalance that by giving them a duty to disclose what went wrong and why. ‘Like the new policy on gagging orders [which have been banned in the NHS by Mr Hunt], it should remove a huge chunk of the culture of cover-ups – in this case, one which has been particularly harmful and distressing to patients, who have had to fight their care providers to get at the truth.’ In his report on Mid-Staffordshire, Mr Francis called for a statutory obligation on individuals and healthcare providers who ‘believe or suspect’ that their treatment or care has caused death or serious injury to inform the patient or their relatives as soon as possible. It is thought the duty will apply to all providers regulated by the Care Quality Commission.","Key recommendation made in the independent report on Mid-Staffordshire, where hundreds died due to appalling care ."

He sneaked into Britain in 2009. Polish authorities did not put him on . a European ‘watch list’ so UK officials did not know he should be . detained if he arrived in Britain using his own passport . 'Old-fashioned family business': The jewellery shop in Bury St Edmunds where Mr Avis was killed . His case has raised concerns about the ease with which foreign criminals are able to get into Britain. Mr Avis who was found dead in his bed was stabbed 13 times and beaten about the face with a glass ash tray. Jewellery, watches and ornaments worth thousands of pounds were stolen in the raid. He was described as “an old fashioned jeweller” who relied on a walking stick and frame to get around after suffering a brain aneurysm more than 20 years ago. Mr Avis was said to be a gentle and private man who was passionate about classic cars and “as sharp as a button”. He had lived alone since the death of his mother in 1989. His family released a statement after his death, saying: 'His life centred on his shop and flat. Due to this he was, perhaps, extremely vulnerable.' Police later announced they were hunting Melaniuk who had distinctive features including two middle fingers and a thumb missing from his right hand. Judge Devaux told him: 'You have previous convictions in Poland for offences which include burglary and robbery. 'You were unlawfully at large on . January 13 and 14 when the murder happened. When you murdered Peter Avis . you should have been in Poland not at large in this country. 'You murdered a particularly vulnerable man, in his home and using a knife which you had brought to the scene. 'Gentle' classic-car fan Mr Avis was found dead in his bed in the flat above his jewellery shop in Bury St Edmunds . Tragedy: Mr Avis was described as an 'old-fashioned jeweller' who relied on a walking stick and frame to get around after suffering a brain aneurysm more than 20 years ago . 'Your victim was powerless and unable to defend himself yet you repeatedly wounded him. It is an aggravating factor that when you committed murder you were a criminal on the run.' Prosecutor Peter Gair told the court that Melaniuk had served previous jail terms in Poland for theft, burglary and robbery. He added: 'He was wanted for some time in Poland and at some point crossed into Britain where he eventually committed murder.' Melaniuk and his accomplices carefully planned the raid, knowing that there were valuable items in the shop and that Mr Avis was vulnerable, Mr Gair said. When he was arrested, Melaniuk told . police that he did not know anybody was inside the property and panicked . when Mr Avis disturbed him. Asked why he had the knife used in the . attack, he told officers: 'I was in the habit of carrying a knife . because I used to do this in Poland.' Weapon: This knife was found on Melaniuk's person following his arrest in Poland . The total value of the goods stolen could not be calculated because much of the jewellery could not be traced. After the raid, Melaniuk was caught on CCTV at the Opera House nightclub in London giving out jewellery to women. Police found £5,000 of jewellery which had not been disposed of. Melaniuk was identified through the DNA database. Kamel Kita, 21, Pawel Pacian, 35, . Pawel Borowiecki, 31, and Aleksandra Karpiuk, 27, all played a part in . either planning the burglary or helping Melaniuk escape. They were all . jailed at a previous hearing. Vicky Ford, MEP for the East of England, said the case raised questions over how European countries share information. She said: 'We need to have the basic protections regarding a handful of dangerous criminals. Under scrutiny: Ireneus Melaniuk's identity card . 'Does that mean demanding the sharing of information by countries? That’s the question we are asking.' A UK Border Agency spokesman said: 'The onus for flagging someone’s criminal history lies with the police in their home country - we would then use this information to decide whether they should be allowed into the UK.' Bury St Edmunds Conservative MP David Ruffley said: 'On the face of it, the first question we should ask is how did an escaped criminal on the run from Poland not get picked up at the UK border? 'Either he had false documents that were not detected or he may have been smuggled in. 'Either way, this certainly reminds us of the need to tighten our borders so that heinous crimes like this don’t happen on our doorstep in Suffolk.'","Ireneusz Melaniuk had been on the run from a Polish prison, where he had been jailed for robbery .

Women will benefit from the most radical pension reforms for a century – but younger workers will have to delay their retirement into their 70s and beyond, it emerged last night. David Cameron and Nick Clegg will next week outline plans for a new, more generous flat-rate pension, expected to be worth £155 a week. But the sting in the tail is that the state pension age – already set to rise to 67 for both men and women between 2026 and 2028 – will increase further in the years ahead. Reforms: David Cameron and Nick Clegg are set to outline plans for a new flat-rate pension, expected to be worth £155 a week . Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said women, who often fail to qualify for the full basic pension because they have taken time out from work to bring up children and have not built up enough national insurance contributions, will benefit from the reform. ‘This is brilliant for women,’ he told the Daily Mail. ‘In those years when they have been doing things like caring for a child, we will give them a notional contribution, a top-up, so that they get the full flat-rate state pension. Support: Iain Duncan Smith, Work and Pensions Secretary, said women will benefit from the reforms . ‘A woman who stays at home for a period will not now lose out in the pension stakes, which is phenomenal.’ Ultimately, the Coalition plans to link the state pension age to average life expectancy, a move which experts say could see it hit 73 for today’s 33-year-olds and 77 for those currently finishing their A-levels. The flat-rate payment will also hasten the end of the so-called ‘state second pension’, which tops up the weekly basic state pension for better-off people who make national insurance contributions over their working life. Mr Duncan Smith also said the move would be ‘massively pro-saving’ as it will mean an end to the indignity and bureaucracy of means-testing for millions. ‘One of the things that stops people saving is their view that what will happen is that their savings will take them into the means-test territory, but won’t go far enough to give them a decent income,’ he said. ‘A single-tier pension really makes saving worthwhile.’ The reform of the state pension, the boldest since its inception 100 years ago, is the most dramatic proposal due  in a ‘mid-term review’ to be unveiled by the Prime Minister and Mr Clegg. The document is designed to provide a ‘progress report’ at the midway point of a five-year fixed-term parliament. But it will also set out a fresh programme designed to prove that the coalition partners have a shared vision beyond austerity. Other expected measures include: . ■ Childcare reforms to reduce costs for working families . ■ An overhaul to the way that Britain cares for its elderly, with a cap on the sums people have to pay towards their care . ■ Private firms and investment funds to compete to build, operate and maintain new tolled motorways and trunk roads, and plans to reduce youth unemployment . Welcome: Iain Duncan Smith said that the changes will be 'brilliant for women', adding that single-tier pensions make 'saving worthwhile' Mr Duncan Smith has embraced the . single-tier pension, the brainchild of Lib Dem pensions minister Steve . Webb, and persuaded sceptical colleagues, including Chancellor George . Osborne, to go ahead. The Treasury’s doubts about the cost of the reform are understood to have been met by reassurances that as the state pension age rises, and the state second pension is phased out, it will largely pay for itself. Under the reforms, a new payment, worth £140 a week today, will be introduced for all soon after the next election in 2015, by which time it will be worth an estimated £155 a week. The flipside is that the state pension age will rise further. After the Second World War, the state pension age in the UK was set at 65 for men, at a time when life expectancy for a man was 66.4 years and 72.5 years for a woman. But life expectancy has risen to 77 years for a man and 82 years for a woman in England. The latest estimates suggest that by 2056, it will be 84 and 89 years respectively. If the pension age rose from now in line with the change in life expectancy over the past three decades, someone born in 1970 could be forced to wait until 71 before getting their state pension. But if life expectancy and improving mortality rates continue at their current levels, the state pension age could hit 77 by 2071.","David Cameron and Nick Clegg will announce plans for new flat-rate pension .

Big movie makers are more known for doing the popular thing than for doing the right thing, but one mogul recently asked her fellow movers and shakers to shake off the film industry’s stereotypical portrayal of LGBT people. Sony Pictures co-chairperson Amy Pascal gave an impassioned speech at a fundraiser Thursday and urged Hollywood executives to ‘simply cross it out’ when a script on their desks contain a slur, reports Deadline. While admitting the industry’s past ignorance, she emphasized the impact media has on the way people learn to perceive the world and how movies have the power to mold these perceptions from youth. Change: At an LA fundraiser, Sony Pictures exec Amy Pascal encouraged movie makers to remove gay stereotypes from their films . ‘And now,’ she said, ‘I’m talking about kids who are gay and I’m talking about kids who aren’t gay. One group needs affirmation and the other group needs education. And, if I’m being honest, neither of those issues are high on any movie studio or TV network’s agenda.’ Pascal was being honored at an LA Gay & Lesbian Center fundraiser for homeless gay and lesbian youth. The event, held at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel, raised $1 million. Herself married to a man and mother of one, Pascal thanked producers like ‘Max Mutchnick and David Kohan and Ryan Murphy for really changing things’ while also criticizing films that have largely been embraced as pioneering for the community. Scrutiny: While being honored by the LA Gay & Lesbian Center, Pascal asked Hollywood to better scrutinize its depiction of gays and lesbian . While applauding them as movies she would be proud to have made, Pascal warned that these films often still contained largely negative portrayals. ‘Brokeback Mountain, Milk, Boys Don’t Cry, Philadelphia, The Hours, Gods and Monsters, The Talented Mr. Ripley, A Single Man...in all these movies, the main character is murdered or martyred or commits suicide or just dies unhappily,’ Pascal said. There is always, she said, ‘the lesbian murderer, the psychotic transvestite, the queen who is humiliated and sometimes tossed off a ship or a ledge.’ ‘It’s a big joke,’ she continued. ‘It still happens.’ Still negative: While still applauding them, along with animated feature 'ParaNorman,' Pascal noted that even celebrated movies like 'A Single Man' and 'Brokeback Mountain' tend to portray gay people in a depressed or negative light . Pascal also gave a nod to films she believes are helping change perceptions of LGBT people. ‘There are great images, too,’ she said, ‘like the family in The Kids Are All Right. The way the boy in Perks of Being a Wallflower and the middle-aged man in Hotel Marigold and the 75-year-old man in Beginners come out to a better, richer, more fulfilled life.’ She also credited the makers of ParaNorman for their animated portrayal of a gay football player whose sexuality is ‘totally incidental to the plot’ and asked ‘can’t we depict men and women who just so happen to be gay – perhaps a lawyer or soldier or business executive or scientist or engineer?’ She closed her heartfelt appeal by asking her colleagues to take it upon themselves to change their industry. ‘How about next time, when any of us are reading a script and it says words like fag, or faggot – homo – dyke – take a pencil and just cross it out. Just don’t do it.’",Chairwoman Amy Pascal gave impassioned speech to LGBT group urging other movie makers to simply 'cross out' slurs and negative portrayals from scripts .

Judge Rupert Mayo told him: 'I have to sentence you for serious infliction of grave injuries.

An adrenaline junkie soared through the air in a boat attached to hundreds of balloons today as part of a test flight for an ambitious attempt to cross the Atlantic. Jonathan Trappe was cheered on by crowds this at the Festival Del Globo del Leon, in Mexico, as he tested out his new equipment with an early morning flight. Cramped in a seven foot boat the intrepid adventurer carried out the dry run as he prepares to fulfill his dream of crossing the Atlantic next year. Accompanied by his co-pilot Nidia Ramirez, the adventurer will now fly across Mexico for 11 hours in the dry run. A bystander said: 'Everyone stood right next to it holding him down. Then they said launch and he let the ballast go and off he went - there was no stopping him. It went off like a rocket, it was amazing how quickly he lifted off.' Trappe, who had worked through the night with 20 helpers filling the balloons with helium, soared above the crowd and drifted perfectly towards a nearby lake to test the emergency landing procedure. The ‘shake-out’ test - which will give the team vital information about its capabilities - also included a landing and relaunch manoeuvre on a near by lake, to see if it was able to land safely on water.

Patients are being left in pain because NHS cost-cutting means care is being rationed, a report warns today. Hip replacements, cataract surgery and weight loss treatments are being graded as ‘low clinical value’ in a bid to save money. But there are ‘widespread’ fears the rationing of minor treatments will harm patients’ quality of life and lead to more serious complications later. Hip and knee operations, cataract operations and weight loss treatment are being rationed to save money, MPs warn, harming the quality of life of patients . The NHS is in the grip of the so0called Nicholson Challenge to find £20billion of efficiency savings in four years to 2015. But the powerful Public Accounts Committee warns that health trusts are simply cutting costs and postponing treatment rather than finding ways to provide care more cheaply. It even linked the impact of financial pressures to the Mid-Staffordshire scandal in which up to 1,2000 needlessly died as a result of poor care and neglect. Chairman Margaret Hodge said: ‘The NHS . has achieved its financial savings target, but this has in large part . come from freezing wages. ‘We are concerned that other savings are being achieved by rationing patients’ access to certain treatments. ‘These include cataract surgery and . hip and knee replacements. These procedures are described as being ‘of . low clinical value’, but people waiting for these operations suffer pain . and a poorer quality of life. ‘Furthermore, the finances of some . trusts are fragile, and there is a risk they may resort to simple . cost-cutting rather than finding genuine efficiency savings.’ Labour MP Margaret Hodge, chairman of the PAC, warned the rationing of care could create long-term health problems . The report criticises the Department of Health and the NHS Commissioning Board, the new body set up under the health reforms charged with the running of the health service, saying they are ‘not doing enough’ to help organisations reform services. The NHS claims to have saved £5.8billion in 201-12, but less than two thirds of the savings could be proved through national data. Nursing and doctors groups insisted that treatment must always be based on need not cost, but warned that care was being rationed. Dr Peter Carter, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘Not only are certain treatments being rationed, we are also concerned that nursing care itself is starting to be rationed. ‘Of course the NHS has to be financially healthy, but this won't be achieved in the long term if trusts are living on the edge, either financially or in terms of care. ‘Financial instability, a reduced and demoralised workforce and a lack of focus on quality care have been shown to be a recipe for disaster in the NHS.’ The PAC said the Francis report into the Mid-Staffordshire NHS Trust scandal showed how ‘financial pressures may already be causing some hospital trusts to cut staff with damaging effects on the quality and safety of care’. The MPs warned that the NHS ‘must fundamentally change the way that healthcare is provided’ including moving services out of hospitals and into the community. Royal College of Surgeons president Professor Norman Williams added: ‘Patients' access to treatment should always be driven by clinical need, not compromised by financial pressure. ‘Despite assurances that patients would not be denied treatment because of the NHS savings drive, we are concerned that today's important report highlights that this is still happening. ‘Such a short-term approach creates a false economy and could well lead to higher costs as patients may then need longer, more complex treatment.’ Labour's shadow health minister Jamie Reed said: ‘This is the third time this week that the Government has been told by experts that its cuts to the NHS are hitting patients. Ministers cannot go on ignoring these warnings. ‘The committee is right to highlight the increasing numbers of patients now being denied treatment in a short-sighted bid to cut costs. ‘Patients will find this particularly galling in the same week that George Osborne's Budget took £2.2 billion away from the Department of Health.’ Meanwhile Chancellor George Osborne has been accused of trying to 'claw back' more than £2billion from the NHS in order to make his Budget sums add up. Labour accused Chancellor George Osborne of launching a £2billio raid on the NHS in his Budget this week . Labour said detailed figures in the Budget 'red book' appeared to show that health was underspent by £2.2 billion and that the money would not be carried forward into future years. The Department of Health (DH) confirmed that there had been an underspend but insisted the money would still be available to NHS organisations. Labour's shadow health secretary Andy Burnham accused ministers of mounting a 'raid' on the health budget, despite promising to protect the NHS. He said: 'David Cameron cannot justify cutting the front-line NHS to pay for his failed economic policies. 'At a time when the NHS is facing its biggest financial challenge, when almost 5,000 nursing posts have been lost since the general election, and when one in 10 hospitals are understaffed, I find it staggering that £2.2 billion of the NHS budget is to be returned to the Treasury.' However a Department of Health spokesman insisted the NHS would not lose out as a result of the underspend. He said: 'The Government is meeting its promise to deliver a real terms increase in health spending. Health spending will increase by one per cent in real terms this year compared to last year and 0.5 per cent compared to 2009-10. 'Any NHS underspend will still be available for NHS organisations to ensure high quality, sustainable health services are delivered to patients now and in the future.","Hip, knee and cataract operations are being withheld to cut costs .

The phrase 'I’m eating for two' has burdened many pregnant women with extra weight to lose after giving birth. Even though official guidelines suggest women should put on no more than two stone while pregnant, it’s easy to get carried away during those nine months and recent statistics have found that up to 15 per cent of mothers are obese during pregnancy, jeopardising not only their own health, but also that of the next generation. Hazel Frewin was certainly eating for two and piled on a staggering 8st 5lbs during her pregnancy, making her clinically obese. Eating for two: Hazel Frewin, who put on weight after being pregnant with her daughter Ivy, has now gone from 19st back to 10st . Due to her sudden weight gain, she was left suffering from birth complications, agoraphobia, anxiety and panic attacks. Hazel, 25, from Poole, Dorset, reached 19st by the time she gave birth to baby Ivy, going from a size 12 to a maternity size 24. When her daughter was born - weighing in at a large 10lb 3oz- guilt-ridden Hazel blamed herself for making her baby fat. Now after a two-year battle, she has lost most of the weight thanks to a combination of diet and exercise - including pole dancing. Hazel said: 'I hope my story stops other pregnant women from making the same mistake. When I was pregnant, I happily indulged all my cravings because I was ""eating for two"". New hobby: Hazel has toned up using pole-dancing exercises and even had a pole fitted at home to practice on . Big loser: While she feels that 'eating for two' ruined her post-pregnancy, slowly, the weight came off and Hazel is now a size 12 and weighs 10st 10lb . 'I ignored how big I was getting but as soon as my baby was born, reality hit. 'Not only was I still huge after having her but also she was much bigger than expected which meant I couldn’t have the birth I wanted and needed surgery after delivery. 'I spent my pregnancy gorging on biscuits and crisps, and my baby suffered. I couldn’t believe how stupid I had been.' Hazel was a size 12 when she and husband Daniel, 29, started trying for baby number two in 2010. They already had a son, Charlie, three, and Hazel had sailed through her first pregnancy. But it was a different story when she fell pregnant again in April 2010. Days before her three-month scan was due, Hazel suffered a bleed and was taken to hospital. It was confirmed she was miscarrying her baby. Comfort eating: After falling pregnant again after a miscarriage, Hazel was so happy, relieved and excited that she stopped focusing on maintaining her trimmer weight . The devastated mother took comfort in food. She said: 'I was so crushed I just didn’t care about my diet or myself. I ate whatever I wanted, when I wanted and told myself it was OK because I would be pregnant again soon.' Hazel piled on two stone in as many months. But there was no time to worry about it before she learned she was expecting again. 'I was so happy, relieved and excited to be pregnant again that I didn’t care about the weight gain. All I cared about was my baby. 'I constantly craved chocolate — from bars to biscuits, cakes and milkshakes — so I ate everything I fancied and made sure there was a constant supply. When you are expecting, nobody bats an eyelid if you buy piles of chocolate — in fact, people smile and tell you to enjoy it.' Problems and complications: Her weight meant she was denied the water birth she dreamed of because she was too big to stay in the pool . As Hazel’s pregnancy progressed, midwives gently reminded her about the importance of healthy eating. But the stretchy waistband on her maternity gear offered no real warnings as to how big she was really getting. She said: 'If I craved a bag of crisps I would think nothing of eating four bags in one go. All I could see was my bump growing and my husband was constantly telling me how gorgeous I was, so I didn’t worry.' At seven months she was struck by a pregnancy-related mobility condition called SPD (Symphysis Pubis Dysfunction). Excessive weight gain is a major contributing factor. It left Hazel almost bedbound and she simply ate more. Trim and toned: Without her baby bump for comfort, Hazel suddenly felt conscious of her weight and has now slimmed down . By the time she was due to give birth in April 2011, Hazel weighed 19st. At just 5ft 4in, she was wearing size 24 maternity clothing. Her weight meant she was denied the water birth she dreamed of because she was too big to stay in the pool. Happy and healthy: Hazel is now happy and healthy at size 12 . And there was another shock in store for Hazel after an agonising six-hour labour. 'There were gasps from the midwives and when I saw Ivy, I realised why. She was beautiful but she was huge. She was almost twice the size of some newborns and looked more like a three-month-old baby,' said Hazel. Without her baby bump for comfort, Hazel suddenly felt conscious of her weight. 'I weighed myself when I got home and was shocked to see I was still 18st 2lb. Suddenly I didn’t feel blooming. I felt sickened, ashamed and plain fat,' she said. Hazel’s husband urged her to see her GP for help but she was too embarrassed. 'I didn’t have the courage to walk in and say I was having panic attacks and agoraphobia because I ate too much when I was pregnant. It was too shameful.' Instead she decided to lose the weight alone. In August 2011 she joined a slimming club and started following a healthy eating plan. She said: 'It was hard after eating non-stop in my pregnancy but the group meetings kept me focused and I made sure I was always full up on salad and vegetables.' Slowly, the weight came off and Hazel is now a size 12 and weighs 10st 10lb. She’s toned up using pole-dancing exercises and even had a pole fitted at home to practice on. She added: 'The weight took months to go on and almost two years to come off. '""Eating for two"" ruined what should have been the happiest time with my newborn — and I’ve spent the last two years paying for it.'

The parents of a boy who allegedly died from scurvy appeared in court today accused of child neglect. Dylan Seabridge, eight, died suddenly at home from the illness, which is linked to a deficiency of vitamin C, in December 2011. Julie Seabridge, 45, and her husband Glynn Seabridge, 46, indicated to Swansea Crown Court that they will be pleading not guilty in a trial later this year. Glynn and Julie Seabridge, pictured outside Swansea Crown Court, are charged with child neglect after their son Dylan died of scurvy . Jim Davies, defending Mr Seabridge, . said: 'Because the allegation is an unusual one we will have to identify . experts who work in a very unusual field. 'It will take some research to identify suitable experts to instruct.' The couple, from Crymych, Pembrokeshire, were released on unconditional bail today to face trial later this year . Scurvy used to affect anyone who was at sea longer than perishable fruits and vegetables could be stored. They would begin to suffer when they could not get enough vitamin C - vital for the body as it needs it to make collagen, a type of protein found in many different types of tissue, such as skin, blood vessels, bones and cartilage. Without vitamin C, collagen can't be replaced and the different types of tissue break down. Signs of the condition included muscle and joint pain, fatigue, red dots on the skin, and bleeding and swelling of the gums, which can lead to teeth falling out. In 1753 A Royal Navy Scottish surgeon, James Lind, realised that citrus fruits - which have large amounts of vitamin C - could combat the condition and published a study on it. Modern treatment involves taking vitamin C supplements and eating food that's high in vitamin C. No formal plea was entered and the pair from Crymych, Pembrokeshire, were released on unconditional bail. The pair arrived, both sporting hats and clutching each other's hands. Both carried walking sticks and wore thick coats. Scurvy was at one time common among sailors deprived of fresh fruit and vegetables while at sea. But it is almost unheard of due to modern diets and health care . Symptoms of scurvy are lethargy, spots on the skin, spongy gums and bleeding from the nose. Treatment involves taking vitamin C supplements and eating food that's high in vitamin C. This should quickly reverse the harmful symptoms of scurvy, the NHS says. Foods such as cabbage, grapefruit, sweet potatoes, lemons, broccoli, limes and tomatoes are all good sources of the essential vitamin. An inquest into Dylan's death has been opened and adjourned.

"By . Kirsty Walker . UPDATED: . 08:38 EST, 13 July 2011 . Backing: Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne wants the taxpayer's to see a more transparent version of the country's accounts . Britain will go bust by 2060 if Government fails to offset the impact of an ageing population with higher taxes and tough spending cuts. As people live for longer, public finances are likely to set off on an 'unsustainable upward trajectory', the Office for Budget Responsibilty has warned in its first Fiscal Sustainability report. The horrific prospect comes after  news that the true size of Britain’s debt mountain can be revealed today as £2trillion – nearly £80,000 a household. Previously ‘hidden’ liabilities including the cost of public sector pensions and building projects are being published by the Treasury. They show that future payments to retired teachers, police officers and NHS staff will cost taxpayers £1.1trillion, or £1,100billion. The enormous figure, which is equal to 80 per cent of Britain’s output, is treble the combined national debts of Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland. The future cost of schools and hospitals built under the controversial Private Finance Initiative will pile an extra £40billion on to our debt mountain. The £1.1trillion and the £40billion come on top of the official debt figure of £909billion. The figures will appear on the Government books for the first time when it publishes full accounts for every Whitehall department. The idea – backed by Chancellor George Osborne – is to give taxpayers an idea of what the public finances would look like if the state was a private company. In 2008, Labour put the official estimate for public sector pension liabilities at £770billion – £330billion less than today. Hard times: Britain's 26million households face combined debts of £2.049 trillion . And last March it costed PFI projects at £5.1billion – a fraction of the latest £40billion figure. Adding the new figures to the official debt of £909bn produces a figure of £2.049trillion. That works out as a £78,807 bill for each of the nation’s 26million households. The OBR's report was designed to look beyond its current forecasts for public sector net debt, which go as far as 2013/14. The OBR said net debt is forecast to rise from its current level of 66.1 per cent to peak at 70.9 per cent of GDP by 2013, before it will decline again. But as the effects of an ageing population kick in, the net debt will once again start to rise from around 2030. The £1.1 trillion pension bill in March 2010 - equal to 78.7 per cent of GDP - was £331 billion higher than a year earlier, the OBR said. Elsewhere, the report revealed liabilities arising from Private Finance Initiative contracts were around £40 billion - far above the £5.1 billion previously revealed. There was a further £105 billion in provisions for potential future costs, which among other factors include the potential bill for nuclear decommissioning. The main pressures of age-related spending are from health, state pension costs and social care costs.Health spending will rise from 7.4 per cent of GDP in 2015/16 to 9.8 per cent of GDP in 2060/61, rising smoothly as the population ages, the OBR said. State pension costs will increase from 5.5 per cent of GDP to 7.9 per cent, while social care costs will rise from 1.2 per cent of GDP in 2015/16 to 2 per cent in 2060/61. The OBR also highlighted the impact the new student financial support arrangements announced in December 2010 will have on national debt. Student loans are projected to add £63 billion in today's terms to the net debt by the early 2030s but will fall to £49 billion by 2060 as the value of loan repayments rises. The report stated that if stakes in state-backed banks - including Northern Rock, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group - were sold at current market prices, they would generate a loss of £13.5 billion. The OBR added: 'Needless to say, while our remit is to look at the fiscal challenges of an ageing population, the fact that people are living longer - and longer in good health - is clearly something that society should welcome.' ‘Many people would be amazed to know that until now the government did not have a single set of accounts like any company would,’ said a Treasury source. ‘After years of foot dragging by the . last government we have finally got a true picture of the liabilities . that have been built up for future generations.’ Officially, . the extra costs will not affect the official debt and borrowing figures . as these are measured using national accounting standards. The . new figures also do not include future receipts from tax revenues. However, they will add fuel to the debate about the cost and . sustainability of public sector pensions following last month’s strikes . by unions which saw thousands of schools forced to close. Ministers . say public sector pensions will remain ‘among the very best available’, . providing a guaranteed income for all employees – something enjoyed by . very few in the private sector. But . they argue staff must pay more in contributions and work for longer . before drawing their pension, as most private sector workers have had to . do. Tory . MP Jesse Norman said: ‘These are eye-watering figures. Thank goodness . we now have the proper accounting processes now in place. ‘It . shows the monumental scale of the task face this Government and the . extent to which the last Government failed to recognise these additional . costs in a formal way.’ Laith Khalaf, a pensions expert at . Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ‘The cost of public sector pensions has been . hidden and downplayed for too long so greater transparency is welcome.’ Emma . Boon, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘These latest figures on PFI . and the public sector pension liabilities make extremely worrying . reading. ‘They will also make it harder for trade unions to continue to resist very necessary changes to public sector pensions. ‘The . Government has proposed moderate reforms to public sector pensions to . make them more affordable and must also make steps to bring PFI costs . under control and ensure that further debts aren’t racked up.’ Meanwhile, . a report from the Institute of Economic Affairs has claimed that the . Government could make extra spending cuts of £215billion – which would . take £7,500 off the average household’s tax bill. The think tank has called for a . further reduction in public spending from 50 per cent to 30 per cent of . gross domestic product to help spur economic growth. Legacy: Gordon Brown left British families with a huge burden of debt . The institute said 70 per cent of the public would support tougher spending cuts if it leads to lower taxes. Director general Mark Littlewood said: ‘The coalition Government should listen more to the British people in general and less to organised special interest groups that push for more government spending. ‘This poll makes clear that the public favour a dramatic reduction in the size of government and the right to keep more of their own money rather than surrender it in tax.’ The institute’s report gives a comprehensive review of government spending, suggesting large reductions in the size and scope of government activity, and allowing for correspondingly large tax cuts. It claims that, in combination, these measures would provide for accelerated GDP growth across the medium and long term. The publication of the debt figures coincides with the Office of Budget Responsibility’s first assessment of the long-term state of the nation’s coffers.","Britain's debt is now £2trillion - £78,000 for each family ."

Barely 30 miles separate Sir Michael Caine’s £10 million mansion in the lush Surrey countryside from the rundown terrace in a West London suburb where Stanley Micklewhite eked out his last years. But the gulf in the respective fortunes of the film legend and his younger brother, to whom he was once so close, couldn’t have been bigger. Whereas Michael has personally overseen, at vast expense, the transformation of his 20-acre lawns into something rivalling a stately home, weeds grow through concrete slabs in the tiny paved-over front garden, and paint is flaking off the windows of the modest house in Ruislip where Stanley lived with his wife Marie. Michael Caine at home with his brother Stanley in 1964 - but they had a distant relationship in their later years . Movie star Caine — born Maurice Micklewhite — did not attend his brother’s funeral a few weeks ago, after he died, aged 77, following years of ill health. Nor was Stanley’s passing mentioned on the actor’s official Twitter page, despite him having posted a heartfelt tribute to his friend, film director Michael Winner, who died around the same time. Indeed, news of Stanley’s death only emerged last week just as — with poignant irony — his brother was being honoured by the opening of an exhibition at the Museum of London, commemorating his life and work, to coincide with his 80th birthday. Yet there had been a time when Stanley, also an actor, had dreamt of emulating his brother’s stardom, even appearing in several of Caine’s most famous films, including The Italian Job. Actor Michael Caine talks to his brother Stanley during a break in filming 'Billion Dollar Brain' In London, during the Sixties, they were inseparable, crashing out after long nights of partying at the flat in Chelsea’s trendy King’s Road that they shared with actor Terence Stamp. But while Caine went on to amass an estimated £50 million fortune, Stanley’s film career foundered and he made ends meet by working in Selfridges department store in London. And despite Michael — who lives with second wife Shakira — owning a second grand home in Chelsea Harbour, just a few miles from Stanley’s two-bedroom house, the brothers had a distant relationship in the final years of his life. Stanley’s widow Marie, 67, is understandably devastated by his death. ‘The grief is only just hitting me,’ she told me at their home this week. ‘We were together 35 years; it’s still very raw.’ She says Michael stayed away from the funeral to avoid a media circus. ‘We didn’t want a big fuss,’ Mrs Micklewhite added. ‘But Michael is grieving for his brother. They were very close.’ In fact, a few years before his death, Stanley admitted that he had drifted apart from Sir Michael — a result, he said, of his own battle to stay away from booze. ‘Michael invites us down a lot but [Marie and I] don’t drink any more. We’d love to sit there and drink the best wines in the world, but we can’t,’ he said in 2007. Marie added at the time: ‘We can’t be in Michael’s party circuit. Michael is one of those people who can have [drink] or leave it. But if you’re not that way inclined…’ she said, tailing off. ‘The thing is, we were having a drink every day — the older we got, the more it didn’t agree with us.’ Of course, few would have blamed Stanley if he had stayed away from his brother, rather than face the stark reality of just how different his life was from the opulent lifestyle Michael enjoyed. Until his death, Stanley existed on . regular small hand-outs from multi-millionaire Caine. In the Eighties, . the £95 that the star gave him every week was enough to allow him to . give up his job at Selfridges’ book department and try to launch a . career as a writer, which was sadly unsuccessful. Michael and Stanley Caine in The Italian Job. While Michael's career bloomed, his brother could not emulate his success . Although the money had increased in recent years, it was still enough only for the couple to avoid claiming welfare benefits. Yet proud Stanley also turned down offers from his brother to pay for luxury holidays at the exclusive Sandy Lane Hotel in Barbados. It would only have been natural if he felt uncomfortable in the constant shadow of his famous sibling. The two boys were brought up in near poverty in a two-room flat in Camberwell, South London, by their father, Maurice Micklewhite, a porter at Billingsgate fish market, and their charlady mother Ellen.  Maurice was a gambler and drinker, who regularly frittered away the family’s rent and gas money at the bookies or the pub. Times were tough, and malnutrition led to the young Caine — originally named Maurice after his father — being born with rickets. If the boys’ mother wanted to give them a treat, she would saw a boiled sweet in half with a bread knife. When war came, Caine and his brother were evacuated to Wargrave in Berkshire, then later to the Grange, a grand house in the Norfolk village of North Runcton, owned by a rich timber merchant, where their mother worked as a cook. It was there that the young Caine developed a taste for the finer things by eating the owner’s left-over pheasant and caviar, sneaking sips of red wine and smoking cigar stubs he found in ashtrays. The indefatigable Michael has continued his seven-decade career by starring in the Batman series and the hit sci-fi movie Inception . With the family’s home flattened in the Blitz, they returned to a prefab in Elephant and Castle, South London, after the war. But, in 1956, when the fledging actor was 23, his father died of liver cancer. Later, in the Sixties, after Caine found fame with films such as Zulu, he bought his mother a large house in Streatham Hill, and a mink coat. But as the actor began to hit the big time, his relationship with his brother suffered. Stanley lost touch with him until a chance encounter changed the course of his life. In his autobiography, Michael, who was knighted in 2000, recalls shopping for a sofa in the London furniture store Heal’s in the mid-Sixties. ‘I asked to see one they had out the back,’ he writes. ‘Two blokes in overalls heaved it into the showroom for me, one of them turned in my direction and I saw it was Stanley. ‘I was really shocked to see him looking so shabby and felt terrible that he was working so hard to keep his head above water while I was ordering sofas without a second thought.’ He insisted Stanley move into his London flat and got his brother, who was keen to act, small parts in two of his films, Billion Dollar Brain and Play Dirty. Soon Stanley, who also dropped the surname Micklewhite in favour of Caine, was a fixture alongside his brother at fashionable parties in London during the Sixties, rubbing shoulders with the likes of models Twiggy and Jean Shrimpton and sharing a flat with Terence Stamp and hairdresser Vidal Sassoon. English film actor Michael Caine at home with his mother and brother, 1964. As the actor began to hit the big time, his relationship with his brother suffered . Then, in 1969, Stanley was cast as Coco, one of the robbers in The Italian Job, which starred Caine. But his hopes of matching his brother’s success came to nothing. While Michael went on to appear in such classics as The Man Who Would Be King and Hannah And Her Sisters — for which he won one of two Best Supporting Actor Oscars — Stanley was forced to take on low-paid shop work again. But their story took another extraordinary twist when they discovered their mother had gone to her grave in 1989 keeping a tragic lifelong secret from them. Before meeting their father, she had become pregnant in 1924. The baby, a son called David, was born in a Salvation Army hospital suffering from epilepsy. To avoid the shame of raising a child out of wedlock, Ellen agreed to put him in a mental asylum. But every Monday of her life, except for the war years, she went out, claiming she was going shopping. Instead, she would secretly visit her son. It was only after she died that it emerged she’d given David pictures of his famous actor half-brother. She took a Bible with her on each visit so she could persuade new staff at the asylum to swear on it that they wouldn’t divulge her secret. After a newspaper revealed the heartbreaking story following her death, Michael and Stanley often visited David, who was unable to speak because of brain damage caused by banging his head on the stone floors of the asylum during fits. The actor paid for a nicer room at the care home where David lived until his death in 1992. In recent years, the indefatigable Michael has continued his seven-decade career by starring in the Batman series and the hit sci-fi movie Inception. He’s due to appear this year with Morgan Freeman in the bank heist thriller Now You See Me. As for Stanley, who suffered a series of illnesses in his final years, neighbours had become used to his increasingly frail appearance as he came and went from his down-at-heel home. To the very end, a chasm of wealth and success separated Sir Michael Caine and the little brother who so desperately tried to emulate him.","While Caine went on to amass a fortune, Stanley’s film career foundered and he made ends meet by working in Selfridges in London .

Profits at Moss Bros have tripled, thanks to the soaring popularity of school proms for teenagers marking the end of their exams. The menswear hire chain made £3million in 12 months to the end of January, up from £900,000 in the preceding year. Almost all schools now stage a formal end-of-year celebration, inspired by  American television shows like Glee and High School Musical. Big business: Party wear for hire is doing well thanks to UK teens adopting the American prom tradition . Demand has also been boosted by the trend towards mixing smarter clothes with casualwear, sported by boy bands such as One Direction. Moss Bros said its annual profits were ‘driven by strong demand for eveningwear and the emerging school proms market’. It has noticed a move away from ‘end-of-exam’ discos to formal dances. The highest volume of proms orders are generated in Greater London and the North West. The firm, established in 1851, said: ‘The proms market has continued to grow at a healthy pace over the past four to five years, influenced by American sitcoms and soaps like My Super Sweet 16 and Prom Queen. There are very few schools in Britain that now don’t have proms.’ It added: ‘Many of our younger customers are encouraged to visit due to the nostalgia recounted by their parents.’ What makes you beautiful: One Direction bandmembers Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson, Zayn Malik, Liam Payne and Harry Styles' penchant for mixing smart and casual is having a knock-on effect for Moss Bros .

Mr Brick said his staff are specially trained to help teenagers buy or hire what is often their first suit. ‘We give them a bit more time and space than other chains are able to do,’ he said. In the UK, proms are now being staged for 16-year-olds after the end of GCSEs as well as following A-levels for 18-year-olds. This follows the American tradition, where they have become a major feature in  popular culture for high-school students.","Moss Bros profits go up from £900,000 to £3 million in 12 months .

The Alabama fan who took football fandom to the next level by poisoning rival school Auburn’s cherished, century-old oak tree has been sentenced to three years in jail. Harvey Updyke, Jr. first made himself known as the superfan who poisoned the Auburn oaks when he called into an Alabama sports radio show in January 2012 under the pseudonym ‘Al’ and gloated about the late 2010 misdeed. The following day, Auburn authorities tested the soils around the gnarled old oaks and found lethal amounts of the herbicide tebuthiuron. Updyke was arrested and charged with the crime in February 2011. Guilty: Alabama fan Harvey Updyke admitted he poisoned rival Auburn University's cherished oak trees and was given three years in jail . He pleaded guilty on Friday to criminal damage of an agricultural facility. The split -sentence requires him to serve at least six months in jail and spend five years on supervised probation for the Class C felony. He has been credited with 104 days already served since his bond was revoked after a September incident in which he allegedly threatened employees at a Lowe's store and was arrested. Updyke managed to go through eight attorneys since he was initially charged. He also reportedly confessed to a student reporter in 2012 and then publicly denied the confession ever happened. The former Texas state trooper was also fined $1,000. Cherished: Since the 1950s, Auburn fans have celebrated wins by 'rolling' the trees in toilet paper, but the 130-year-old oaks are now at death's door . The probation terms include a 7 p.m. curfew and prohibit Updyke from going onto Auburn's campus or attending a college sporting event. Auburn fans traditionally gather at Toomer's Corner to celebrate victories, and the case further highlighted the emotions in the year-round in-state rivalry during the two-plus years since Updyke was arrested. 'We have a significant number of violent felonies awaiting trial in Lee County and I could not in good conscience justify financing a three-week trial merely to arrive at no better a resolution,' Lee County District Attorney Robbie Treese said in a statement. Updyke, 64, had pleaded not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect to charges of poisoning the trees during Auburn's successful bid for the national championship in the 2010 football season. Updyke had been charged with criminal mischief, desecrating a venerated object and damaging agriculture. As a result of Updyke's plea Friday, prosecutors will not pursue those charges, according to court documents. Updyke is also banned from that store under the probation terms. Shameful: Despite efforts to salvage the trees, the Toomer's Corner Oaks cannot be saved and will be removed in April . Farewell: A final, goodbye roll will be held for the beloved trees April 20, before they're removed three days later . Treese said restitution amounts would be determined later and are automatically doubled under Alabama law. The DA said expenses would have included transportation and lodging of up to 50 witnesses and fees for several experts. 'Whether or not, Mr. Updyke can manage to stay on probation is entirely up to him,' Treese said. 'Despite the destruction he has caused, no one is capable of diminishing the spirit of our community.' Auburn fans traditionally 'roll' the trees in toilet paper after a win, a tradition that dates back to the 1950s. Tigers fans will have one final, goodbye roll on April 20. The now-skeletal trees are scheduled to be removed three days later.","Harvey Updyke, Jr. pleaded to guilty to the 2010 crime on Friday and received a split sentence that will put him behind bars for at least six months and on supervised probation for five years ."

With the banks closed, long queues at cashpoints and reports that retailers are starting to refuse payments by debit and credit card, official advice is now to take enough cash to ‘cover the duration of your stay, alongside appropriate security precautions against theft’.

The plans need to be in place by Monday, when the European Central Bank has said it will cut off emergency support to the banks. That could trigger their collapse and devastate the economy, potentially pushing Cyprus out of the euro. The worsening situation came on the first anniversary of the eurozone’s banking chief Mario Draghi boasting that the crisis in the single currency was ‘over’. Business Secretary Vince Cable yesterday warned that the EU’s botched handling of the situation risked setting off a wave of bank runs in countries such as Greece, Italy and Spain.

It is a venue that was close to Amy Winehouse's heart, and is among the last places the singer visited in the hours before her tragic death in the summer of 2011. Now Camden's Roundhouse is hoping to pay tribute to the iconic singer, by installing a life-size bronze statute of Amy on a terrace overlooking Chalk Farm Road. The proposed sculpture is expected to show the late singer dressed in her signature retro style, with her hair in its trademark beehive. Tribute: The late Amy Winehouse (seen left in 2007) was a fan of Camden's Roundhouse, which is hoping to install a life-size statue of the singer (an early picture of the planned tribute is seen right) Sculptor Scott Eaton has been commissioned for the piece by the Roundhouse in partnership with the Amy Winehouse Trust. A planning application submitted to Camden Council say the statue will 'show Amy in her prime, striking a pose beneath her iconic beehive'. As well as creating a lasting tribute to the six-time Grammy winner, 27, it is hoped the sculpture would serve as a focal point for fans travelling to Camden to pay their respects to the late singer. Favourite haunt: The Roundhouse has teamed up with the Amy Winehouse Foundation to come up with the planned tribute . Camden Square, the quiet residential street where Amy lived, remains the scene of fan pilgrimages nearly two years after she was found dead. 'The artwork aims to capture the vitality of Amy and her music by faithfully rendering her beauty and iconic sense of style,' the planning document states. 'The design has Amy relaxing on the Roundhouse terrace gazing back at Camden Town. The piece is carefully composed with naturalism. 'Her long flowing hair will be represented sculpturally with a touch of art nouveau styling. Other important style and wardrobe consideration include earrings, dress, shoes and a rose in her hair, all selected and approved by members of her family.' 'Vitality': Planning documents submitted to Camden Council state that the sculpture, seen left and right in early images of the proposed project, would aim to capture Amy's 'beauty and iconic sense of style' Mr Eaton has worked on several high-profile projects including the hit films War Horse and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. The organisers behind the scheme have said they would not allow the statue to become a 'shrine', and a sign would be installed asking that visitors do not leave gifts or flowers. The sculpture, while visible from the road, would not be lit up at night, the application states. Amy supported Paul Weller at the Roundhouse in 2006 as part of the BBC'S Electric Proms. If it gets the go ahead from Camden Council, the statue would be unveiled on September 14 this year - one what would have been the singer's 30th birthday. Pilgrimages: Fans continue to gather at the late singer's house nearly two years on from her tragic death . The plans for the statue were first revealed by Amy's father Mitch Winehouse last summer, who said: 'Amy was in love with Camden'. 'We wanted to have a bench in her memory outside her house in Camden Square, but there are so many hoops you have to jump through to do that, planning permission for one,' he said at the time. Mr Winehouse has also been quick to dismiss some critics who questioned whether a statue of the singer was appropriate given her high-profile battles with alcohol and drugs. 'The reason why there is going to be a statue of Amy at the Roundhouse, hopefully, is because everybody loved Amy,' he said. 'Amy was a human being and she was a strong girl who had weaknesses.' He said his daughter 'did a lot for Camden, did a lot for kids', adding: 'Why the hell shouldn't we put a statue up?'.","The Roundhouse is seeking permission for tribute from Camden Council .

"By . Duncan Farmer . PUBLISHED: . 17:00 EST, 23 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:04 EST, 23 March 2013 . Author and playwright J. M. Barrie created his best-known character, Peter Pan, to entertain the offspring of friends who lived near him in London. When the five little Llewelyn Davies boys were orphaned in 1910, Barrie became their unofficial  guardian and each summer took them on holiday to Glanhafren Hall. The sumptuous Georgian manor is on the edge of  Newtown, in picturesque sheep-farming country in Powys, mid-Wales. In an idyllic echo of Neverland, Peter Pan’s home, Barrie and the youngsters would fish in the River Severn below the house or play croquet on the lawns. And in the evenings, Barrie would direct the children in plays. Grand: Glanfraen Hall, returned to its Georgian splendour and on the market for £675,000, is where Peter Pan author JM Barrie would spend his summers . Now, the scene of those blissful holidays – or at least the major part of Glanhafren Hall – is up for sale, with a price tag  of £675,000. In the Fifties, part of the house was  converted into three two-bedroom flats,  leaving the remaining, larger part with six bedrooms, three grand reception rooms and ten acres of land running down to the river. By the mid-Nineties, the house had been empty and decaying for almost a decade and was bought by a local builder, who set about restoring it. ‘Halfway through the work, however, his wife thought there was a ghost in here and said she would never move in,’ says current owner Peter Oak, 62. ‘So we bought it ten years ago for £450,000. ‘It’s not haunted. In fact, it’s the friendliest house we’ve ever lived in,’ says Peter, who runs a storage business in Telford. His wife Theresa, 58, says: ‘It was a wreck when we moved in. One of the tanks had leaked upstairs, so all the centre of the house was black with mould. It’s been a real labour of love, but we’ve done it before in previous houses and have a passion for it.’ Conversion: The owners spent ten years restoring Glanfraen Hall from top to bottom, so it now reminds of the days of JM Barrie's holidays . Great rooms: Glanhafren Hall has six bedrooms, three reception rooms and ten acres of land running along the nearby river . Tradition: The drawing room with original part-stained-glass windows . Rolling hills: Peter and Theresa Oak are selling JM Barries holiday home Glanhafren Hall, on the edge of Newtown, mid-Wales . The couple bought the whole building, so started living in one of the flats, which had been modernised, and began work. ‘We’ve done it all very sympathetically and spent about £150,000,’ says Peter. ‘We had to put in new electrics and plumbing and new bathrooms, but we put everything else back as it was. The previous owner had replaced the roof, the guttering and the chimneys to a really high standard – we just had to do the interior.’ The drawing room, with its delightful part-stained-glass windows, was used for tea dances 70 years ago, and now the couple use it for their own parties. ‘It’s been quite a society house in its day and is great for entertaining,’ says Theresa. ‘It’s also handy for town – the theatre’s within walking distance – and there are good schools nearby.’ Inspiration: J.M. Barrie writing at his desk in Adelphi Terrace House - but it was in Wales he spent his summers, imagining the adventures of Peter Pan . Fun and games: Author JM Barrie playing croquet at the hall with one of the Llewelyn Davies boys who inspired him to write Peter Pan . In spite of its name, Newtown is old: the Romans had a garrison here and drovers brought sheep to the market for centuries, until its recent closure. Laura Ashley opened her first shop 20 miles away in Machynlleth and the firm’s headquarters are in Newtown. The result of Peter and Theresa’s efforts is splendid and faithful to the original, with ornate plaster ceiling cornices and roses. But the real grandeur of the house lies in the scale of its rooms and their views, as well as a dramatic spiral staircase in the entrance hall. The large reception rooms are a particular delight and the main sitting room, with its beamed ceiling, panelled fireplace and dark wood floors, is evocative of its era. While the new kitchen is not particularly big, it could easily be doubled in size by knocking through to the utility room behind. There are also cellars, a study and four bathrooms. ‘We didn’t know very much about J. M. Barrie when we came here, but it’s become a very important part of owning this house,’ says Peter. ‘We breed dressage and showjumping horses and need more land,’ he explains. ‘We’ve bought some land in South Shropshire and we plan to build a house there when this is sold.’ Fine and Country, Newtown, 01686 623123.","JM Barrie's holiday home in Wales is on the market for £675,000 .

The euro was plunged into fresh crisis last night as Cyprus flatly rejected plans to raid bank accounts on the debt-ridden island to save its basket-case economy. In a stunning rebuke to European leaders, the Cypriot Parliament voted to reject draconian plans to seize up  to 9.9 per cent from the bank accounts of islanders, including 3,000 UK service  personnel and 60,000 other Britons who have made their homes there. Not one MP backed the proposal, which the German government had demanded in exchange for backing a fresh bailout for the bankrupt Cypriot economy. A Cyprian woman celebrates with parliament member after the Cyprus parliament has rejected the bailout deal . 'Voice of the people': Crowds of protestors outside the island's parliament broke into applause after learning the measure had been rejected . Cash airlift: The 123-ton Voyager - a converted former Airbus - took off from RAF Brize Norton at 3pm today and is expected to deliver its unusual payload at around 8pm tonight . Protestors cheered in the streets outside the Parliament when the result was announced, chanting: ‘Cyprus belongs to its people.’ The vote plunges the single currency into fresh turmoil as Cyprus will now have to find €5.8billion to pay its debts if it is to win a new €10billion bailout fund from the EU. Without external funds, the country’s banks face collapse and the government could go bankrupt. Most cashpoints are already out of service. There was renewed speculation last night that the hugely unpopular tax raid demanded by Germany will push Cyprus into the arms of Russia, which is seeking a toehold in the Mediterranean.

No vote: The proposed measure, part of a wider bailout package, had been met with fury across the island . Cypriot Finance Minister Michalis . Sarris was in  Moscow last night seeking a bailout, which would allow . the country to ignore the diktats of Berlin, Brussels and the European . Central Bank. Rumours were rife last night that . Russian energy giants Gazprom and Rosneft could bail out Cyprus in . return for access to Cypriot gas reserves. On a day of farce, Mr Sarris was reported to have asked to resign and been told that he could not – claims he later denied. Cypriot officials also threatened to pull out of the euro altogether if Germany and EU officials sought to impose the tax. The original plan would have seen those with savings under €100,000 pay a tax of 6.75 per cent, and those above that amount would be taxed at 9.9 per cent on their deposits. Facing fury at home and from Russians who make up an estimated third of the total amount in Cypriot banks, the Government amended the bill yesterday to exempt small depositors with up to €20,000 in the bank. But this was rejected by MPs. The former governor of the Cypriot central bank, Anthanasios Orphanides, claimed: ‘What we’re witnessing is the slow death of the European project. Opposition: Protestors had gathered outside the Cypriot parliament, where the bank levy raid was rejected tonight . Chancellor George Osborne is under pressure to kickstart the economy and ease the cost of living . ‘What we have seen for the last few days is a very serious blunder by European governments that essentially are blackmailing the government of Cyprus to confiscate the money that belongs rightfully to depositors in the banking sector in Cyprus. ‘It is sending a message that no-one with deposits in a small country like Luxembourg should feel safe about their deposits. 'No-one with deposits in a weak country, like Spain, should feel safe about deposits.’ Although Cyprus is the smallest eurozone country to be bailed out, the details of the plan had sent shockwaves through the single currency area as it was the first time savers’ banks accounts have been directly targeted. Last night Cyprus and EU bosses were in a stand-off. Nicholas Papadopoulos, the chairman of the Cypriot parliamentary finance committee, said banks would remain closed ‘for as long as we need to conclude an agreement’. That could mean Cypriots going without money until next week. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government refused to shift its demands. French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici said the eurozone could not lend Cyprus any more money, since the country’s debt would become unmanageable.’ Anger: The proposed levy came after Germany refused to fund the deal unless every account holder dipped into their own pockets themselves to help foot the bill . Protest: The proposed levy has sparked ferocious outcry from Cypriots as well as the thousands of British expats and troops with bank accounts on the island who would lose large chunks of their savings under the scheme . The European Central Bank, shocked by the decision, said that it is willing to provide  liquidity to Cyprus. In a statement, it said: ‘The ECB takes note of the decision of the Cypriot parliament. ‘The ECB reaffirms its commitment to provide liquidity as needed within the existing rules.’ Despair: Traders in London react yesterday as markets struggled in light of the decision by eurozone leaders to part-fund a bailout of Cyprus by taxing bank deposits .

Breivik and his mother Wenche Behring Breivik met earlier this month at Ila Prison where Breivik is being held, his lawyer Tord Jordet said today.

A murderer's llament: Anders Behring Breivik, seen here making a salute at his trial in Oslo, is pleading to be let out of jail to attend his mother's funeral . 'He was allowed to say goodbye. They both knew it would be the final meeting,' Mr Jordet said. 'I spoke to him this morning. He was grieving. It was very sad news to him.' Breivik and Mr Jordet also discussed whether the confessed mass murder would like to attend her funeral. 'He would like to do so but it is up to the prison (board) to decide,' Mr Jordet said. The 34-year-old right-wing fanatic killed 77 people in twin attacks on July 22, 2011, in Norway's worst peacetime massacre.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 09:49 EST, 23 September 2011 . Breakthrough: An effective treatment could be available within six years . Doctors have made an 'exciting' breakthrough that could lead to a new treatment to stop - or even reverse the symptoms - of multiple sclerosis. Researchers have discovered that people with MS have significantly lower levels of brain chemicals called neuro-steroids. Neuro-steroids help build brain cells and maintain their function, connecting different areas of activity in the brain. Scientists and neurologists at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada believe that it would be possible to replace the missing chemical with a daily pill that would represent a completely different way of dealing with the disease that affects more than 85,000 people in the UK. Dr Chris Power announced the discovery in a research paper in the latest issue of Brain. He said: 'This frankly is an exciting breakthrough and has huge potential. The role of neurosteroids in the brain has been known for some time but no one thought - until now - that they might play a role in MS.' The link with the disease was made when his team tested the brains of 16 patients from Alberta - which has the highest levels of MS in the world - and discovered that they had significant lower levels of a particular neuro-steroid allopregnanolone compared to a group of patients who had died from other diseases. Dr Power's team were excited because trials using allopregnanolone - which is derived from cholesterol and is linked to vitamin D - are already underway in epilepsy and depression. 'The chemical is already available which speeds up the process that could eventually get this into humans with MS,' he said. Researchers are interested in the vitamin D link because it has been established that there are higher levels of MS in Northern areas of the world such as Scotland where reduced levels of the vitamin have been linked to less exposure to sunlight. When mice with MS were treated with allopregnanolone it had a significant effect, reducing inflammation levels in the brain and repairing nerve fibres. In MS the myelin sheath around nerves is destroyed by the disease which is triggered by the immune system 'over reacting' and attacking healthy cells rather than invading infections and diseases. Multiple Sclerosis is a complex condition which can be difficult to diagnose because it presents in many different forms. Symptoms . can include problems with vision, balance and dizziness, fatigue as well . as bladder, speech and swallowing difficulties. The condition can also affect memory and thinking and impact on a sufferer's emotions. In severe cases a person with MS will be unable to walk. Most people will not suffer the same symptoms and they will not suffer all of them at the same time. MS is usually diagnosed in adults between 20 and 40 years old and is more prevalent in women. Treatments up until now have included drug, exercise and physiotherapy alongside diet and alternative therapies. MS . is an inflammatory disease which damages the tissue around the brain and . the spinal cord, this affects the ability of cells to communicate leaving the body unable to respond to instructions from the brain. MS in its severest form can cause loss of mobility but the Canadian researchers found that the mice given the steroid were found to have increased levels of mobility over a 30 day period following the start of treatment. Dr Power said: 'Overall we found that the mice showed a 50 per cent reduction in MS disease severity in the brain.' At present there a number of drugs that slow the progression of MS but after a period of time many patients 'fail' on the treatments and their disease continues to progress. Dr Power believes that regular treatment with allopregnanolone - and possibly other neurosteroids halt the disease and can reverse some of the symptoms. He said: 'We were surprised by our initial discovery that this neurosteroid was present in reduced levels in MS patients and then amazed to discover that when we used it as treatment it had such significant effects.' Funding for the research came from the Canadian Government and the country's MS Society. Dr Power is now hoping to get Government or drug funding tostart the first stages of humantrials with allopregnanolone within the next couple of years. He said: 'Initially we will be looking that it is safe to take. But to some extent that work has been done because of the trials in other disease areas. Our research on mice showed no toxicity. 'If we overcome that hurdle - which we should then we would be onto stage two trials to establish that it works as a treatment. 'We are talking about it being at least six or seven years away as a treatment but I am optimistic about our chances even though there are a number of hurdles to overcome.'","Researchers in Canada discover low levels of brain chemicals in sufferers .

A seven-year-old girl may have been blinded in one eye by stone-throwing in the playground - only months after a report highlighted aggressive behaviour as a problem. Staff failed to notice that Hajrah Shabir's cornea had been ruptured after she was hit by a stone thrown by children at school. Despite telling teachers she was in a lot of pain, staff did not realise the seriousness of her injury and told her to wash her eye with water. Hajrah may never see again in her right eye after the stone-throwing incident in the school playground . It took 90 minutes before Hajrah's parents, Zaida, 46, and Mohammed, 54, were notified of their daughter's injury and her mother immediately came to collect her. Zaida, a qualified nurse, quickly realised her daughter was blinded in one eye and immediately took her to A&E. She was transferred to Manchester’s Royal Eye Hospital for surgery and she now waits to see if she will regain her sight. Hajrah's parents are furious with the response of struggling Cravenwood Primary in Crumpsall, north Manchester,following their daughter's injury. Quoted in Manchester Evening News, Zaida said their reaction was 'inadequate'. She told the paper her daughter's cornea had been ruptured and she needed five stitches to repair it. There have also been complications with a cataract, meaning the family do not know if Hajrah will regain her sight. Only two months ago, OFSTED inspectors published a report which highlighted that aggressive behaviour in the playground needed to be addressed. The report states: 'Behaviour is poor in the playground. There is too much name calling and aggressive behaviour.' Inspectors found the school to be 'inadequate' in all four of the areas observed, including 'quality of teaching' and 'behaviour and safety of pupils'. The report also said some pupils are 'too boisterous' and 'there is not enough play equipment so pupils no have have enough to do'. Hatim Kapacee, executive head of the school, in Crumpsall, pictured, said staff acted as soon as they realised the seriousness of the injury . OFSTED advised in January that the school, which has been placed in 'special measures', ensures the safety and behaviour of all pupils by developing a new policy to promote good behaviour-developing opportunities... 'and supervision at lunchtimes eradicating prejudice-based name calling, swearing and bullying'. Zaida said: 'This is not the first time I’ve heard of stones being thrown and yet nothing’s been done about it. But there are some real problems with behaviour and I think there is a safety risk to all pupils.' It is not believed Hajrah was deliberately targetted in the incident. No one was available at the school to comment on the claims. However, quoted in the Manchester Evening News, Hatim Kapacee, the school’s executive head, said staff acted as soon as they realised the seriousness of the injury. 'First aid was administered immediately but at that stage there was no sign of visible injury. Her eye was checked again 20 minutes later by another first aider, and staff called her mum to come and collect her,' he said. He said the incident was the result of boys throwing pieces of mosaic that had become loose in the playground. He said one piece hit Hajrah after ricocheting off a wall. The mosaic has now been removed, and the boys and their parents have been spoken to and understand the serious consequences of their game, he said.","Hajrah Shabir's cornea was ruptured and needed five stitches to repair .

Families who have been exposed to violent crimes and tragic suicides have become victims twice – as some allege they have been taken advantage of by a bio-hazard clean-up firm that quoted one price but charged thousands more. Aftermath Inc, a company that takes on the grim task of cleaning up homes where people have been murdered or committed suicide, is being sued by five families in Texas. They claim that the company took advantage of them in their darkest hour, charging as much as ten times their quoted price. Scroll down for videos . Taken advantage: Steve Randall, left, was charged more than $43,000 by Aftermath after his stepson Aaron Wilks, right, committed suicide in his Texas home in March . Small fortune: Randall said the rate he was charged was exponentially higher than the $5,000 to $8,000 he was quoted . Steve Randall alleges that the company quoted him $5,000 to $8,000 to clean up his home after his 30-year-old stepson Aaron Wilks killed himself in the stepfather’s Toyah, Texas home in March. KHOU in Houston reported that Mr Wilks had been depressed before he took his life – he had just left the Army, was going through a bitter divorce, and did not have a job. After Mr Randall was referred to Aftermath by a sheriff’s deputy, he arranged a time for the company to clean up the room. That included removing the carpet and cleaning the walls. Mr Randall said an Aftermath employee told him that they were a bio-hazard company, not a cleaning crew. But the grieving stepfather had other things weighing heavy on his mind. ‘He was talking and I wasn’t listening,’ Mr Randall told KHOU. ‘I mean, this was 10 to 12 hours after my son had done this.’ When he got the bill, he was flabbergasted – it was for more than $43,000. Mr Randall’s attorney, Ted Lyon, told KHOU: ‘(Aftermath takes) advantage at a vulnerable time, then come back and prey on them to the tune of 40 to 50-thousand dollars to clean up a room.’ Hazards of the job: Aftermath said haz-mat workers are required to take long breaks because of the stifling nature of the suits . Hard work: A spokesperson for Aftermath said the cleaning is thorough and much more than a simple sweep, since they are often dealing with gruesome scenes . According to Courthouse News Service, other families are suing the company for similar grievances. The prices quoted to the grieving family members were inflated as much as 300 to 1,000 times, court papers say. The documents allege that workers took advantage of their hourly rate, often working for 15 minutes out of the hour, and taking 45 minute breaks, and reported charges for supplies that were not used in the clean-ups. ‘The claims are completely frivolous,’ Aftermath spokesperson Laura McGowan told MailOnline. ‘These are also people who gave us perfect scores on the jobs we did for them.’ She said the clean-up the company does is much more labour intensive than the average scrub down. ‘The work we do requires more than a mop and a bucket. We follow every guideline with dealing with biohazards,’ she said. The company's official statement read: 'Each customer signs a written agreement detailing Aftermath’s fees. At the conclusion of each job, the customer approves, in writing, the final number of hours worked and the tasks accomplished. 'Thereafter, each receives an invoice reflecting the agreed upon charges.  There are no hidden fees.' Aftermath told KHOU that they stand by their service fees, citing unexpected costs and labour needed to return a scene to normal. But Mr Randall is not the only alleged victim of overcharging. Regine Revelus was billed $32,571.75 for crime-scene clean-up in her Milton, Massachusetts home following a gruesome 2009 killing spree. Moment of grief: Mother Regine Revelus had the grim task of cleaning up her home after her 23-year-old son shot dead his two younger sisters and was killed by cops; it happened in 2009 . Caught: Revelus was billed $32,571.75 and a lien was put on her home before she contacted her insurance company . Her 23-year-old son had murdered two of his younger sisters before he was shot by police. Ms Revelus could be seen at the time crying out in pain and crumpling to the ground. She told WHDH in Boston last November that before she could send the bill to her insurance company, Aftermath had already put a lien on her home. The clean-up should have cost half the amount, according to expert estimates. The station reported that Aftermath put liens on 41 other Massachusetts homes since 2006. ‘If they put a lien on your house, that’s mean,’ Ms Revelus told the station. Aftermath says on its website that ‘cheaper isn’t always better,’ and adds: ‘Cutting corners can result in the return of dangerous biological colonies, which may lead to further damage or the potential of a lawsuit if an exposure incident occurs. 'Aftermath does not cut corners. We use industry-specific, specially formulated chemicals and follow all federal, state, local laws, in addition to best-practice standards and the ""Aftermath Way"".’","Aftermath Inc is bio-hazard company that cleans murder and suicide scenes - often in residential homes .

A mother who was seriously injured when a flight information board fell on top of her and three of her sons at an Alabama airport on Friday still doesn't know that one of the boys was killed in the horrific incident. Heather Bresette suffered broken ankles and a crushed pelvis when the billboard, weighing at least 300 pounds, dropped from the wall as her family were standing beneath it at Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport. She and two of her sons, who were also injured, were improving at hospitals on Sunday. But the woman's 10-year-old son Luke was killed by the electronic board. Ms Bresette had had surgeries over the weekend and was getting better, University Hospital spokeswoman Nicole Wyatt said. However, she was still in intensive care and unconscious. 'She does not know that her baby is dead,' said the family's priest, the Rev. Don Farnan. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

Crushed: The giant flight status sign, estimated to weigh between 300-400 pounds, pictured resting on the ground of the brand new airport terminal that just opened last week . The Bresettes, a family of seven, took a . weeklong vacation in Destin, Fla., and were about to fly home to . Overland Park, Kan., when the sign fell. Luke Bresette, 10, was killed. His . brother, 5-year-old Tyler, suffered a concussion but was expected to be . released from a children's hospital. His 8-year-old brother, Sam, had a . broken leg and nose. Luke was the middle child of the . five. The father, Ryan Bresette, and another son and daughter, were at . the airport but not injured. During their vacation, the family swam in the Gulf of Mexico and Luke went parasailing for the first time. 'His dad said he was thrilled. He was . an adventurous kid. He loved sports,' said Farnan, a priest at St. Thomas More in Kansas City, Mo. After the sign fell, it took six . people to lift the large board and a dozen people to hold it up while . first responders administered aid. Officials were investigating how the . sign fell at the newly renovated airport and took down an identical . billboard on Saturday. The renovated concourse opened March . 13. It was part of an ongoing $200 million upgrade of Birmingham's . airport. The construction began in June 2011 and is being overseen by . Brasfield & Gorrie Global Services Group. Family tragedy: Luke Bresette, 10, was killed after an airport sign collapsed on him, his mom and two younger brothers . Luke Bresette, 10, second from right was the third eldest of five children . The Birmingham-based company said in a statement it was working with airport authorities to determine why the sign fell. 'This is a terrible tragedy that none . of us fully understand, and we hope that the family who lost their . loved one will find strength through prayer and the support of all of . us,' the statement said. At St. Thomas More, hundreds of . worshippers showed up for a Saturday morning Mass that usually has about . 75 people. Luke's uncle Alex Bresette placed a Rockhurst High School . jersey on the altar. 'He would have been in the Class of 2020,' he told the Kansas City Star.

'Ryan is especially grateful for the . amazing support of the people in Birmingham. They even started a fund . for the family at a bank there,' Farnan said. 'There are long, loving . arms that stretch between Birmingham and Kansas City.' Heather Bresette . and her three sons were standing beneath a . flight information sign at the Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International . Airport when it fell without warning. First responders: The massive flight information board is seen propped up against the wall by rescue workers . Scene: Witnesses reported a loud crash with people screaming in the area before eight to 10 people hurried to lift the massive board off of the family . Luke was pronounced dead at Children's of Alabama, said Deputy Coroner Derrick Perryma. Heather . Bresette, who remained conscious throughout the terrible ordeal, was . taken to UAB Hospital with two broken ankles and a fractured pelvis. The airport completed the first phase . of a more than $201 million modernization effort and opened newly . renovated concourses about a week ago.

'I . cannot come close to understanding his heartache. But I will get . answers. I'm calling on the airport authority to thoroughly investigate . this horrible incident. I want a full report on my desk as quickly as . possible,' he told AL.com. Airport officials met Saturday, but would not elaborate on other safety measures being taken.

A New Jersey politician referred to bondage and spanking in a series of lewd emails he sent to a female lobbyist who was later arrested for stalking him. Karen Golding, who was detained in 2006 for stalking New Jersey Democrat Joe Cryan, said at the time she had been intimately involved with the politician - claims he has previously denied. Now more than 150 graphic emails Mr Cryan, 51, sent to Golding - in which he instructed her to wear 'leather and boots' and invited her to surprise him at his office - have been published in a newspaper. Secret emails: The racy messages from Assemblyman Joe Cryan, left, to former lobbyist Karen Golding, seen right in 2004, were published in a U.S. newspaper . Mr Cryan was vice chairman of the state Democratic Party when he sent messages to Golding from the AOL email account listed on his official Assembly candidacy biography in 2004. He also emailed her from his state government account and his account associated with his role as Union County undersheriff, according to the New York Post. In one missive the Democrat - who is being touted as the party's next state chairman - asked Golding what she wanted to be 'spanked with', before adding: 'What will you wear to beg for it?'. In other emails he referred to oral sex, 'Playboy-like' lingerie, and told Golding he was fantasising about her visiting him at his legislative office in Elizabeth, Union County, writing: 'Surprise visits are always nice'. Graphic: Democrat Joe Cryan has been touted as the party's next state chairman . It is thought that Mr Cryan was sending the emails while at work, either in his role as an Assembly member or his $110,000 per year post as Union County undersheriff. In one sent on July 21 2004, the politician asked the then lobbyist: 'You delete these emails, right?', as he urged Golding to dress up and surprise him at the Democratic National Convention in Boston the following week. Mr Cryan served as Democratic Party state chairman between 2009 and 2010, and has recently been touted for a return to the role. In 2006 Mr Cryan contacted police after Golding began harassing the politician and two women he dated, the report said. She was convicted of stalking after she let herself into Mr Cryan's unlocked car and left a note. Golding subsequently pleaded guilty to stalking one of the women. Last month Golding filed the emails in Morristown Superior Court as part of a motion to reduce her sentence of two years' probation, 90 days on a sheriff's labour programme and $155 in penalties, the New York Post said. A lawyer for the politician told the newspaper the emails were irrelevant, pointing out that Golding pleaded guilty to a crime. Golding has declined to comment.","Democrat Joe Cryan sent lewd emails to lobbyist Karen Golding .

Matt Lauer, who has anchored the popular morning programme since 1997, was so close to making the move to ABC last year that everybody close to the situation thought the deal was 'signed, sealed and delivered', according to a report. The claims emerge amid reports the 55-year-old journalist's $25million NBC contract will not be renewed when it expires next year, after the fiasco surrounding the dismissal of former co-anchor Ann Curry saw his popularity with viewers take a nosedive. Move: Today show host Matt Lauer was on the brink of moving to rival network ABC last year, it has been claimed . ABC chiefs including Bob Iger, CEO of parent company Disney, and Ben Sherwood, ABC News boss, all thought the move was confirmed, as did Lauer's agent, according to a report in the New York Post. The NBC stalwart would have become an ABC News personality, co-hosted the Katie Couric talk show, and taken an occasional role on Good Morning America, said the report, which cited New York magazine. But the journalist changed his mind and decided to stay at NBC, a decision which is said to have left Mr Iger and others 'infuriated'. Ratings slide: Matt Lauer, seen left with co-anchor Savannah Guthrie, is said to have changed his mind and stay at NBC - his home of almost 20 years . The Today show was thrown into turmoil after co-anchor Ann Curry was sacked from her post, and Mr Lauer was not seen to fight for his colleague.

Facebook's Silicon Valley headquarters are far away from the eye of Hurricane Sandy, yet for employees of the social networking company, the storm hit home. After nearly six months of watching helplessly as the value of Facebook's stock crumbled, Facebook employees finally got the greenlight to cash in some of their stock on Monday as the 'lock-up' on trading them expired. Unfortunately, any would-be sellers will have to wait a little longer, as the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq were both closed on Monday because of Sandy, the exchanges' first weather-related shutdown in 27 years. Vacant: The New York Stock Exchange floor will be closed on Monday as Hurricane Sandy churns up the coastline . Both exchanges said they would remain closed on Tuesday as well, pending confirmation. Roughly 234 million shares of Facebook stock owned by company employees were eligible for trading on Monday. Facebook had moved up the lock-up expiration date for employees by a few weeks, a move that analysts said could help bolster morale among the company's rank-and-file who have been unable to sell shares even as other insiders and early investors have sold. The end of the employee lock-up also comes as Facebook's stock has been on the rise, gaining more than 12 per cent last week after the company reported better-than-expected quarterly results. Facebook shares closed Friday's regular session at $21.94. The world's Number 1 online social network became the first U.S. company to debut on the public markets with a valuation of more than $100 billion. But Facebook's May initial public offering has been marked by a series of setbacks, including a glitch with the Nasdaq on its first day of trading and controversial revelations that the company had pre-briefed analysts for its underwriters ahead of the IPO, advising them to reduce their profit and revenue forecasts. Prepared: The NYSE opened a day after Hurricane Irene reached NYC last year but that storm hit on a Sunday rather than the start of the business week . Shares of Facebook, which were priced at $38 in the IPO, declined to as low of $17.55 in September as investors fretted about its slowing revenue growth and limited mobile advertising revenue. The implications of the closure of the stock exchange for Facebook workers came as New Yorkers hunkered down for the worst of Hurricane Sandy. It will be the first time since 1888 that the New York Stock Exchange will have been closed for two consecutive days because of bad weather. While the NYSE is closing the Nasdaq which relies on electronic trading will stay open . The cause then was a blizzard that left drifts as high as 40 feet in the streets of New York City. Much of the East Coast was at a standstill Monday as the storm approached. Mass transit and schools were closed across the region ahead of the storm hitting land, which was expected to happen later Monday. Areas around the Financial District were part of a mandatory evacuation zone. The storm surge is already pushing water over seawalls in the southern tip of Manhattan. After the NYSE closed Monday, traders continued to work  by buying and selling shares electronically. The . New York Mercantile Exchange, a commodity futures exchange, will also close its trading floor on Monday as it is located in a mandatory . evacuation zone. Rare: The NYSE floor rarely closes for weather with the last major stop in trading coming in after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks . Stay home: Along with the NYSE most New York transportation is on hold and schools are closed as the city waits for Sandy . The CME Group, which owns NYMEX, said all electronic . markets will open at their regularly scheduled times. Last year the NYSE opened the day after Hurricane Irene’s Sunday arrival, but as Sandy is expected to hit on Monday its unsure how long the closure may last. Sandy, a Category 1 hurricane with . sustained winds of 75 mph as of Sunday afternoon, had already claimed 65 lives in the Caribbean before it began churning up the Eastern . Seaboard. Hurricane Sandy has forced the shutdown of transportation . systems throughout New York and public schools. Governor Andrew Cuomo said New York . City's subways and buses will shut down Sunday evening and will remain closed until further notice.","Closure on Monday was the first time the market shut since the September 11th attacks .

A French factory implicated in the horse meat scandal was today embroiled in fresh controversy after health inspectors found 57 tons of banned British mutton there. Veterinary scientists said that the meat was obtained by an illegal mechanical process which sees it mixed with bone marrow. It has been banned in Europe since the Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or ‘Mad Cow Disease’ crisis. Despite strict export controls, the 57 tons of mutton were found at the Spanghero factory in Castelnaudary, near Toulouse, in south-west France. In trouble: 57 tons of banned British mutton have been found at the Spanghero factory in France . The company was today blaming unscrupulous British exporters for trying to pass off the illegal meat as ordinary mutton which could be used in sausages and other products. Spanghero has already been found guilty of handling horse meat from Romania labelled as beef which eventually found its way on to supermarket shelves in the UK. Now Antoine Leroy, the prosecutor of Carcassonne, said the mutton could have carried diseases into the human food chain. ‘The process and the sale of such meat is banned in Europe,’ said Mr Leroy after an analysis was carried out by the Directorate of Veterinary Services in Paris. This was the same organisation which analysed horse meat during last month’s crisis, finding it prevalent in all kinds of food products. Spanghero, which employs 300 people, is already facing criminal action over its part in the horse meat scandal. It was temporarily closed for business by the French government for selling 750 tons of horse as beef, but was then controversially allowed to reopen. The BSE crisis in Britain saw the European Union ban British beef exports for 10 years from March 1996. It led to numerous restrictions on certain types of meat exporters, including mechanically produced mutton. Controversy: The factory was previously caught up in the European horse meat scandal . Sheep marrow has been associated with Scrapie, a fatal degenerative disease that affects the nervous systems of sheep and goats. It is one of several spongiform encephalopathies which are related to BSE, which can be easily transmitted to humans by eating food contaminated with the brain, spinal cord or digestive tract of infected carcasses. Barthelemy Aguerre, the CEO of Spanghero, said that his company had ‘once again, been fooled by its supplier.’ Bovine spongiform encephalopathy, known as BSE or Mad Cow Disease, was discovered in thousands of British cattles in the mid-1990s. It causes the fatal disease vCJD, which killed dozens of people after they ate infected beef. In March 1996, the export of British beef was banned in an attempt to prevent the spread of the disease. Three years later some of the restrictions were lifted, but it was not until 2006 that beef and live cattle could be freely exported around Europe. However, because of the increased risk posed by bone marrow, its export from the UK is still banned. Unions at the Spanghero plant in Castelnaudary had lobbied President Francois Hollande’s government for the return of their meat handling licence following the horse meat scare last month. Despite clear evidence of fraud, the Agriculture Ministry allowed it to start trading again. The Spanghero horse meat is believed to have been used in 4.5million ready-made meals in 13 European countries, including the UK. The separation process can allow muscles, nerves and bone marrow to enter the food chain. It is banned for sheep, cattle and goats in Europe because of the potential presence of Scrapie and BSE in the animal parts removed. Food minister Guillaume Garot said: ‘As a preventative measure we have ordered the recall of all products made from the meat’. Spanghero said that the frozen meat arrived in two lots from a UK supplier, and was mainly due to be used in merguez sausages and charcuterie. It suggested that the illegal meat had started off in the UK and been passed through a wholesaler in the Netherlands. A Spanghero spokesman said: ‘The meat should not have left the UK. It is not our fault.’ The illegal British mutton was shipped through a Dutch trader which is already under investigation over the horse meat scandal. Draap Trading Limited bought horse meat from Romanian abattoir CarmOlimp, which is known to have sold horse cuttings that eventually ended up in Britain. One of Draap’s customers main customers is Spanghero, to whom it also supplied the British mutton. Shipping documents show it was transported to a cold storage warehouse used by Draap. A French Ministry of Agriculture spokesman said the offending mutton was labelled as ‘minced lamb’. On the basis of these documents, Spanghero could not have known that the meat had been cut using a technique prohibited in the EU since 2001, said a spokesman. Draap is already at the centre of a criminal investigation in Holland. Experts believe a fraudster has been passing off horse filler as beef because it costs four times less. But under Dutch regulations, if a company is found to have deliberately passed off horse meat as beef the maximum fine is just £880.","Spanghero factory was accused of exporting horse meat to the UK .

He was arrested thanks to an anonymous . tip-off after police released CCTV footage of the shocking attack, . which showed Ayoade casually jogging away while Miss Kabir lay . unconscious on the ground. Ayoade later told police that the . petite 16-year-old 'didn't have a friendly face',  that he was . 'intimidated by her' and that she 'made me feel like a pauper with her . facial gestures'. He said he couldn’t cope with 'taking an insult from a little person like that'.

Thug: Ayoade lashed out at Tasneem Kabir in broad daylight as she walked alone in east London . Ayoade's ferocious punch knocked Miss Kabir out cold . After falling to the ground, Miss Kabir was left with three broken teeth, a bleeding lip, and cuts and bruises on her face . The sudden blow left the teenager - who fell face first onto the concrete - unconscious . The CCTV footage showed Ayoade casually jogging away while Miss Kabir lay unconscious on the ground . Miss Kabir . had left home with her brother shortly after 12.30pm on November 13, but . realised she had forgotten her phone and went back to retrieve it as . her brother walked on. Prosecutor . Bandana Batra told Thames Magistrates Court: 'She remembers seeing the . defendant looking at her from the other side of the road as she went . back. 'As she came out he . was inside the gates to her street and she says he approached her and . was within 30cm of her face. She found this strange but she carried on . walking. 'Miss Kabir was . then walking along High Road, Plaistow and all she remembers next was . waking up in the ambulance,' the lawyer said. Ayoade had followed the teenager, launching his surprise attack as she passed the Black Lion pub. Ms . Batra said: 'He started jogging up behind Miss Kabir and he struck her . her on the side of the head causing her to lose consciousness and that’s . why she doesn’t remember what happened.' The girl hit the ground face first following the blow from Ayoade.Ms . Batra said: 'It was an unprovoked attack on in a lone female.

Officers discovered cannabis at his home in Plaistow and he pleaded guilty to possession of a class C drug on November 21. Ms Batra said: 'He said he admitted to doing it, it was a misunderstanding on his part. He had had too much to drink and smoke that day.' 'He said he was going about his business and was intimidated by her look, she looked like she wanted a fight. She looked about 19 or 20. He did not approve of the way she looked so he went back and punched her....He said ""Nah, that hurt, I can’t go further in my day taking an insult from a little person like that"".' 'He thought to himself “No, no I am not taking this”,' the lawyer said. 'He never spoke to her, just punched her.' Marianna Christou, defending, said that Ayoade had come to the UK from Nigeria when he was just three years old, and had to fend from himself from young age. He was said to have no contact with his family. Ms Christou said: 'He has drunk since he was 16 and smokes up to 10 joints a day which in my submission is excessive and perhaps this causes some degree of paranoia and low self esteem.' Ayoade was remanded in custody and is due to appear at Inner London Crown Court on a date to be fixed. A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice declined to comment on his treatment in prison. The jail is run by service company Serco and houses 900 convicted and remand prisoners.

Parades taking place across Greece to mark the country's Independence Day have been marred by anti-austerity protests. Riot police carrying shields and wielding batons struggled to control demonstrators in Patras, while protestors scuffled with plain clothes officers in Agrinio. Pictures of the scenes across Greece - evidence of ongoing public anger over painful austerity measures imposed by international lenders - emerged as Cyprus agreed a last-ditch 10billion euro EU rescue package to avert financial meltdown.

Athens' Independence Day parade took place amid a heavy police presence which saw onlookers barred from much of the route.

In a bow to austerity, no . armoured units took part and no planes flew overhead. Heavy security has been the norm . since a military parade in October 2010 in the northern city of .

The measures have led to a deep recession and record-high unemployment in the country. Cyprus . today became the latest country to negotiate a multi-billion euro . international rescue package to save its banks from collapse. The . president of the Mediterranean island agreed a 10billion euro . (£8.5billion) bailout deal with the EU, the European Central Bank, and . the International Monetary Fund in Brussels. The IMF said the deal, reached after 10 hours of last-minute negotiations, would form a 'lasting, durable and fully financed solution' to the crisis engulfing the cash-strapped nation. But the bailout will see draconian measures imposed by Brussels to prevent Cyprus going bust - including the possibility of Popular Bank of Cyprus customers with more than 100,000 euros in their accounts losing up to 40 per cent of their money. The deal will wind down the largely state-owned Popular Bank of Cyprus, also known as Laiki, and shift deposits below 100,000 euros to the Bank of Cyprus to create a 'good bank'.

Claims: Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich has been arrested by U.S. intelligence services, according to unconfirmed reports . Roman Abramovich's agent today denied reports the Russian billionaire had been arrested by U.S. intelligence services. Speculation was rife online this afternoon that the Chelsea football club owner, 46, had been detained by the FBI in New York. The claims were initially made by a Russian news website before being circulated on Twitter. But Mr Abramovich's Moscow-based agent . John Mann said the report was 'not true'. 'He is in the U.S., but he has not been arrested or detained,' he said. The FBI has also issued a denial. 'We didn't arrest him. It's just not true,' a spokeswoman said in response to an unsourced report by Russia's RBK financial news portal. Mr Abramovich has reportedly docked . his $1.5billion (£1bn) yacht Eclipse, the world's biggest, in New York because his partner . Dasha Zhukova is due to give birth to his seventh child. Evraz shares, which have fallen 45pc . over the past year, slid 5 oer cent at one stage in early afternoon trading . before clawing back lost ground after the rumour was denied. Abramovich, 46, is a major . shareholder in London-listed steel firm Evraz, whose shares fell by more . than 6 per cent before recovering to trade 3.4 per cent down on the day after the denials were issued. The . London-based tycoon, reputed to have close ties to the Kremlin, was . brought in late last year to strike a peace deal between the feuding . shareholders in Norilsk Nickel, the world's largest nickel and palladium . miner. With an estimated fortune of $14.6billion, he is currently the 5th richest person in Russia and the 50th in the world, according to the 2012 Forbes list. Born into poverty in Saratov, Russia, Mr Abramovich was orphaned at the age of two and raised by his uncle in Ukhta. Billionaire: The Chelsea football club owner is in New York, where his partner Dasha Zhukova (left) is due to give birth to his seventh child . Mr Abramovich's agent John Mann issued several denials on his Twitter account this afternoon . As a student in Moscow, he set up a . small firm making plastic toys which made him enough money to start an . oil business in the Omsk region. He quickly made a name for himself and joined the board on oil giant Sibneft before taking sole charge. He oversaw a merger which created the . fourth-biggest oil company in the world before it was sold to the . state-run gas company, Gazprom. In . 1999, Mr Abramovich was elected to the lower house of the Russian . parliament representing Chukotka and was re-elected for a second term in 2005. He bought Chelsea in 2003 after stepping in to save the club from administration. The . team has enjoyed considerable success since, winning six domestic cups, . three Premier League titles and the UEFA Champions League. But it is estimated that Mr Abramovich has invested some $1billion in the process. Grand arrival: Mr Abramovich has reportedly docked his $1.5bn yacht Eclipse (above, file picture) in New York ahead of the birth . Legal fight: Last year, Mr Abramovich won a multi-billion-pound High Court battle with fellow oligarch Boris Berezovsky (pictured), who was found dead at his Ascot home on Saturday . Along the way, he has also built a reputation as a ruthless hirer and firer, with several managers coming and going during his tenure. The latest, Roberto Di Matteo, was sacked just months after winning the Champions league and FA Cup.

The 46-year-old has been married and divorced twice, to Olga Yurevna Lysova and Irina Vyacheslavovna Malandina (pictured) He apparently left no note and sceptical friends are convinced he was murdered because 'suicide was not in his DNA'. Mr Abramovich already has two sons and three daughters with his ex-wife Irina Vyacheslavovna Malandina and one with Dasha. The oligarch, who has been married and divorced twice, met Dasha, the daughter of Russian oligarch Alexander Zhukova at a New Year's Eve party hosted by her father in 2006. But apparently romance did not blossom between the two until he had split from second wife Irina after 16 years of marriage. Their divorce ended in a record settlement rumoured to be £1.5billion made by Abramovich to the mother of his five children.","Unconfirmed reports by Russian website RBK were circulated online .

Buffeted by euro turmoil and the threat of further financial regulation, the City of London suffered a further blow yesterday as it slipped further down World Economic Forum's Financial Development Index. For the first time Hong Kong has muscled its way to top place in the rankings of the world's leading financial systems and capital markets, overtaking the U.S. and the UK. The U.S. slipped to second place although its overall score was unchanged from last year. The UK fell to third place due to lower scores on securitisation and initial public offering (IPO) activity, the Financial Development Report said. The report, launched in 2008, analyses financial development including the efficiency and size of banking and other financial services, the business environment, financial stability, and the extent of financial disclosure and market liberalisation in each centre. Hong Kong, which jumped from fourth place last year, has capitalised on a regulatory crackdown on the finance sector in the U.S. and Europe and on its proximity to China to lure more financial services to its shores. 'Hong Kong's ascent to the top of our index marks a major milestone, the first time in the report's history that the United Kingdom or the U.S. didn't come out on top,' said Kevin Steinberg, chief operating officer of the WEF USA. 'While Western financial centres are understandably focused on short-term challenges, this report should serve as a wake-up call that their long-term leadership may be in jeopardy,' he said. Hong Kong, which jumped from fourth place last year, has capitalised on a regulatory crackdown on the finance sector in the U.S. and Europe and on its proximity to China to lure more financial services to its shores. Singapore was ranked fourth, followed by Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and Japan respectively. Nigeria was bottom of the list with Venezuela not far behind. China rose three places from last year to 19th whereas eurozone countries slipped in the rankings as they struggled to contain their debt crisis, including Germany which dropped one place to 14th. More than 90 per cent of countries have not returned to pre-crisis levels in terms of ease of access to credit and loans, venture capital availability and financing through local equity markets, according to the latest report. 'The challenge will be how to encourage economic activity while not fuelling the next credit bubble, which could cause severe consequences down the line,' said Isabella Reuttner, senior project manager at the WEF and editor of the report. 'Therefore, when looking for possible solutions, decision-makers should not lose sight of the long-term consequences while they fix the short-term situation.' The Financial Development Report ranks 60 countries, analysing drivers of financial system and capital market development that support economic growth. The World Economic Forum said the index aimed to serve as a tool for advanced and emerging economies to benchmark themselves and identify areas for reform.","'While Western financial centres are .

When her husband of 30 years left her for another woman, Sharon Olds wrote poems as a way of coping with the heartbreak. But more than a decade later, she has had the last laugh after the poems she penned won the TS Eliot Prize. Mother-of-two Sharon Olds, 70, split with her husband when she was 55. Award winner: Sharon Olds has won the TS Eliot Prize for a collection of poems about her husband of 30 years leaving her for another woman . She wrote poems about the whole process of the separation, from the moment her husband said he was leaving her for another woman, to running into him with his new partner. She described in detail the difficulty of events like telling her mother it was over and her grief at being deserted, but also wrote about the strength she gained from her new-found freedom. A long time coming: Sharon Olds, pictured at a reading in New York in 2009, wrote the collection called Stag's Leap - named after the former couple's favourite wine - 15 years ago.  But the author only released the poems last year after promising her children not to publish anything about her divorce for at least 10 years . Miss Olds promised her children she would not publish anything about the divorce for 10 years afterwards. ‘I want to ask myalmost-no-longer husband what it’s like to notlove, but he does not want to talk about it,he wants a stillness at the end of it.’ ‘And sometimes I feel as if, already,I am not here – to stand in his thirty-yearsight, and not in love’s sight,I feel an invisibility like a neutron in a cloud chamber buried in a mile-longaccelerator, where what cannotbe seen is inferred by what the visibledoes. ‘ . ‘I want to say to him, now, Whatwas it like, to love me – when you looked at me,what did you see? When he loved me, I lookedout at the world as if from insidea profound dwelling, like a burrow, or a well, I’d gazeup, at noon, and see Orionshining – when I thought he loved me, when I thoughtwe were joined not just for breath’s time,but for the long continuance,the hard candies of femur and stone,the fastnesses.’ ‘And afterthe first minute, when I say, Is this abouther, and he says, No, it’s aboutyou, we do not speak of her.’ She finally unveiled the collection, entitled Stag’s Leap after the former couple’s favourite wine - 15 years later. Announcing it had won the coveted T S . Eliot Prize, poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy, who chaired the judging . panel, described it as ‘a tremendous book of grace and gallantry’. She added: 'From over 130 . collections, we were particularly impressed by the strong presence of . women on the list and were unanimous in awarding the 2012 T.S. Eliot . Prize to Sharon Olds' Stag's Leap.' Miss Olds, who was born in San Fransico, is the first American woman to win the £15,000 prize, which was awarded in a ceremony in London yesterday. Miss Olds said finally publishing the poems 15 years after the separation allowed her to move on. ‘Something did shift. Definitely, yes - there was a sense of completion,’ she said in recent interview. Her previous collection, One Secret Thing, which explored themes of war, family relationships and the death of her mother, was shortlisted for the award in 2009 and she was also shortlisted in 1992 for The Father. She currently teaches creative writing at New York University. The TS Eliot Prize, which celebrated its 20th anniversary this year, was established in 1993 to honour the 40th anniversary of the Poetry Book Society and is named after the society’s founding poet. Widely considered to be one of the world’s most important poetry awards, it is given to the best new collection of poetry published in the UK and Ireland each year. Previous winners include Ted Hughes, Carol Ann Duffy and Seamus Heaney. Poets who made this year’s shortlist, including Simon Armitage and Gillian Clarke, were each presented with £1,000.

Embarrassing body odour could become a thing of the past thanks to a new range of summer clothing for men from Marks and Spencer. The High Street store are incorporating Odegon DeoTags into the under arms of their latest suits and blazers. The innovative patches are made from nano-porous material that is designed to  absorb body odour molecules and then neutralise them to avoid unpleasant smells. Keeping cool: The M&S Man Superlite Suit, £179, uses Odegon DeoTags under the arms to prevent body odour . But while fashion with the material is only just hitting the shops, it has had a lifesaving use for decades. During the Second World War when chemical attacks were feared, the material was patented by the Ministry of Defence for use in gas masks. Embarrassing problem solved: Excess sweating is not a good look - or smell . Lifesaving: The same material is used in gas masks because it can absorb and neutralise harmful gases . The material can absorb and neutralise harmful gases so has been used in the production of chemical, . biological, radiological and nuclear suits and gas masks since 1942. The patches may not be put to lifesaving use by M&S but it could spare many a modern man's blushes by its ability to prevent smelly sweat patches. The technology is used in the M&S Man Superlite Suit, £179, and M&S Man Performance blazer, £99, that go on sale this month as part of the store's summer range for men. Odegon Technologies, who make the  DeoTags used in the M&S clothes, say each patch 'has the surface area equivalent of a tennis court and last for the length of the garment, even after washing'. They add: 'Polarised molecules from body odour are absorbed and permanently trapped within the material’s structures until the garment is cleaned, either by hand or machine washing or by dry cleaning, and the molecules are flushed out.' The company also make patches for shoes called 'DeoSole' that eliminate foot odours in the same way.","Summer suits have 'Odegon DeoTags' in underarms .

French actress Catherine Deneuve has defended film star Gerard Depardieu's decision to leave his home country to avoid a tax on the super rich. Deneuve has written an open letter in response to actor Philippe Torreton, who criticised Depardieu for leaving France 'with a load of dosh'. She accused him of him of being resentful of the 'great actor'. Depardieu, 63, put his £50m Paris mansion up for sale and moved to Belgium after France's socialist government set the top rate of income tax at 75 per cent on earnings above one million euros (£812,000). Fellow actors: Catherine Deneuve has leapt to the defence of Gerard Depardieu . Deneuve, who has starred in various films with Depardieu, including the 1981 classic The Last Metro and more recently Potiche in 2010, wrote: 'To take aim at his physique! His talent! 'This 'mess' you speak of - what right do you have, what democratic motive do you claim as grounds for your dirty condemnation?' The actress was writing in left-wing newspaper, Liberation. The letter comes after another actress, Brigitte Bardot, sprang to the defence of Depardieu, who she said was a victim of 'unfair vilification'. The Cyrano de Bergerac star, who has set up home just across the Belgium border in Nechin, has been condemned by French prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault for being 'unpatriotic'. Movie star: Catherine Deneuve in Roman Polanski's 1965 film Repulsion . Mr Ayrault said wealthy people are not . leaving the country because they are afraid of becoming poor but because . they 'want to become even richer'. President Francois Hollande insists tax hikes are crucial to easing the country’s £24billion deficit. Depardieu has threatened to give up his passport in response to the attacks and said he should be shown more respect. He has also accused the government of punishing success. Critic: Philippe Torreton had spoken out against his fellow French actor . The newly-set tax rate makes France the highest taxing country in the EU. Belgium's highest tax rate is 50%. France’s richest man, Bernard Arnault, who runs luxury goods brand LVMH, applied for Belgian nationality in September and his decision  prompted Liberation to run a front page headline, ‘Get lost, rich b******!’ Russia president Vladimir Putin stepped into the row last week by telling a news conference Depardieu can 'consider it settled' if whats a Russian passport.

Britain may once have had an empire on which the sun never set – but a study shows its true global reach was far more extensive than maps would suggest. Throughout the ages, Britain has invaded almost 90 per cent of the world’s countries. An analysis of the histories of almost 200 nations found that only 22 have never experienced a British assault. British rule: A map of the world shows in red the extent of the British Empire in 1901 but a new study has found the Empire's global reach was underestimated and that almost 90 per cent of the world's countries have been invaded by Britain . These include Luxembourg as well as Guatemala, Tajikistan and the Marshall Islands in the Pacific. The study – part of a new book, All . the Countries We’ve Ever Invaded: And the Few We Never Got Round To – . comes against the background of maps which show that at its height the . Empire ruled over almost a quarter of the world’s population. Author Stuart Laycock worked his way . around the countries on the globe alphabetically to see if British . forces had ever strayed into each territory. However, only a very small proportion of his total list of invaded countries made up formal dominions of the Empire. The remainder have been included if a . military incursion was achieved through force, the threat of force, or . by negotiation or payment. Raids by British pirates, privateers and . armed explorers have been included if they were acting on the behalf or . approval of the government. Therefore, many countries that once . formed part of the Spanish empire and seem to have little historical . connection with the UK, such as Costa Rica, Ecuador and El Salvador, . made the list because of the repeated raids they suffered from . state-sanctioned British sailors. The earliest invasion launched from . the British Isles was an incursion into Gaul, northern France, at the . end of the second century. Clodius Albinus led an army, thought to . include many Britons, across the Channel in  an attempt to seize the . imperial throne. The force was defeated in 197AD at Lyon. Other invasions highlighted in the . book include that of Iceland  in 1940 after the neutral nation refused . to enter the war on the Allies’ side. Military manoeuvre: Iceland was invaded in 1940 by the British after the neutral nation refused to enter the war on the Allies side . Two-year project: Author Stuart Laycock started writing the book after his son asked him how many countries the British Empire had invaded . The invasion force, of 745 . marines, met with strong protest from the Iceland government, but no . resistance. Mr Laycock, who has previously . published books on Roman history, began the two-year research after . being asked by his 11-year-old son, Frederick, how many countries the . British had invaded. ‘I was absolutely staggered when I . reached the total,’ he said. ‘I like to think I have a relatively good . general knowledge, but there are places where it hadn’t occurred  to me . that these things had ever happened. It shocked me. ‘On one level, for the British, it is . quite amazing and quite humbling, that this is all part of our history, . but clearly there are parts of our history that we are less proud of. The book is not intended as any kind of moral judgment on our history or . our empire. It is meant as a bit of fun.’ The only other nation which has . achieved anything approaching the British total, Mr Laycock said, is . France – which also holds the record for having endured the most British . invasions. He is now asking for the public help . in listing more British invasions. Mongolia is listed as never been . invaded, but Mr Laycock believes it could have been.","A new study suggests the Empire's global reach has been underestimated .

Millions of people will this week share in the grief of a couple whose six-day-old son died during the filming of a television documentary. Brave parents Hayley Jackson and Pete Heseltine agreed to appear on Channel 4 documentary One Born Every Minute to raise awareness of baby Kaiden's illness, a rare condition called Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia, which makes it nearly impossible to breathe unaided. Doctors in Leeds battled to save the tiny baby before deciding to turn off his life support machine, in July last year. Hayley Jackson, 27, lost her six-day-old baby Kaiden to a rare condition called Congential Diaphragmatic Hernia. She agreed to appear on Channel 4's One Born Every Minute to raise awareness of the disorder . Speaking to the Daily Star Sunday ahead of the programme this Wednesday, Hayley, 27, said: 'It was heartbreaking. We were by Kaiden's side the whole time. It was very soul destroying.' The parents were first told something was wrong at Kaiden's routine 20-week pregnancy scan, when doctors said the baby's heart and lungs were not in the right place and told Hayley to consider having an abortion. But the prospect of having her child induced was too much to bare and the couple decided to carry on with the pregnancy. Husband Pete Heseltine, 25, told the documentary of the couple's soul-destroying loss and said they would try for more children . They were told their son would have to be born at Leeds General Infirmary so he could receive specialist treatment. It was then that Channel 4 approached the couple and asked if they could follow Kaiden's progress. Hayley said: 'They knew from the start it could go one way or the other. Through the whole thing we tried to remain positive. I did not want to look at what could happen. I just tried to black it out.' Doctors at Leeds General Infirmary advised Hayley to have an abortion but she says she couldn't bare to go through with it . Pete, 25, said: 'It was very upsetting at the time but I had to be strong for Hayley. It was a bit weird having the cameras there because it was not the best experience for them to be filming but we wanted to raise awareness of the condition and get the message out there.' The couple say they are now considering having more children. More than 9,000 people have signed a petition to support charity CDH UK, asking MPs for more funding to research the condition.' The documentary airs on Channel 4 on Wednesday on Channel 4 at 9pm.","Tiny Kaiden, aged just six days, suffered from rare disorder of the diaphragm .

A key NHS target for GPs to refer everyone with cancer symptoms to a specialist within two weeks has failed to have any impact on survival rates, a shocking new study has found. Despite being heralded as a way to boost the UK’s poor record on cancer survival compared with the rest of Europe, patients ‘fast-tracked’ to hospital are still having to wait for treatment after their initial appointment. The study by the King’s Fund, an influential think-tank, also found that hospitals struggling to meet the target have been forced to delay treatment of cancer patients referred in other ways, for example after turning up at casualty with symptoms. Target: The fast track system sees patients with cancer symptoms referred to a specialist within two weeks - but the target has not impacted on survival rates . In some places, waiting times for breast cancer treatment have increased. GPs in some parts of the country are also referring too many patients along the fast-track route who later on turn out to be free of cancer, contributing to the delays. The report found there was ‘no difference in survival’ between those referred along the two-week route compared with those referred in other ways and concluded the two-week target ‘cannot be judged to be effective’. Lead researcher Anthony Harrison said: ‘The popular perception is this target has a more positive effect than it actually does – and politically it looks very good. ‘But the majority of cancers are still not being detected via the two-week target – most are being picked up after patients come into A&E departments with symptoms. ‘The fast track is just picking up a minority of cancer patients – about  25 per cent of all cases – but it appears to be causing delays for others. For patients, it is a huge psychological benefit to know they can see a specialist within two weeks and it would be politically disastrous to abolish the target. But maybe it could be relaxed to three weeks while also improving the time it takes to access treatment.’ Delays: Researchers said the majority of cancers are still not being detected via the two week target - most are picked up after patients present at A&E departments with symptoms . The target was introduced by former Prime Minister Tony Blair in 1999 and by 2010, 95.5 per cent of all patients referred this way by GPs were seen within two weeks by a specialist. But the King’s Fund report said delays further along ‘offset the gains that the two-week rule is intended to produce’. It also found that the proportion of patients referred via the two-week wait who were later found to have cancer had fallen from 13 per cent in 2007 to 11 per cent in 2009-10. The report said: ‘This suggests that patient selection has worsened rather than improved in recent years.’ Sara Osborne, head of policy at Cancer Research UK, said: ‘Diagnosing cancer at an early stage has a huge impact on survival, and we hope to see further efforts made to ensure that GPs have access to the right training and resources to diagnose cancer quickly and accurately. ‘The Government is giving GPs direct access to diagnostic tests, which could reduce delays.’ A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘Earlier diagnosis is at the core of our £750 million cancer strategy and plays a vital role in our aim to improve survival rates and save an extra 5,000 lives every year by 2014.’","Key NHS target for GPs to refer everyone with cancer symptoms to a specialist within a fortnight has failed to have any impact on survival rates .

Tessa Dunlop, cultural historian and writer, said: ‘Over the last 60 years women have seen their roles expand unrecognisably from the traditional stay-at-home figure. ‘More money in women’s pockets and an increased degree of independence has provided them with more options, as both professionals and consumers. The female character has been revolutionised. ‘Women are embracing more roles than ever before – from Adele effortlessly juggling her singer/songwriter persona with that of being a new mother, businesswomen and partner to the increasingly successful Lena Dunham as US filmmaker, actress, comedienne and New Yorker.’ Researchers found that modern women are embracing more responsibilities than at any other time in history. The average British women juggles 14 different roles such as wife, mother, worker, homeowner and handyman. One in six women surveyed said they had more than 20 public faces as they lead ever more varied lives. But just three per cent say they reveal their real personality to their bosses and only seven per cent open up with their colleagues - almost on par with strangers at six per cent. Women said 35 was the age at which they begin to feel free to show their character and personality. Strong: Joanna Lumley, left, and Margaret Thatcher, right, came in at number five and number six in the poll respectively . Meanwhile confidence (63 per cent); intelligence (56 per cent) and strength of character (47 per cent) were top of the list when it came to defining today’s spirited women, according to the survey.

"By . Jo Macfarlane . PUBLISHED: . 18:50 EST, 19 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:28 EST, 21 January 2013 . Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has described a plan to close an A&E unit as ‘sticking two fingers up’ at local residents – putting him on a collision course with the Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt. The emergency ward at Epsom Hospital in Surrey is under threat following a controversial recommendation by NHS officials. Mr Grayling, the local MP, has vowed to fight the proposals in a move that could trigger a Cabinet row. Contentious: The Justice Secretary Chris Grayling (left) is on a . collision course with Heath Secretary Jeremy Hunt (right) over the . proposed closure of the A&E unit at Epsom Hospital . He is the second Minister to clash with the Government in a backlash over nationwide closures of casualty units after Iain Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, began a fight to save his local A&E ward at King George Hospital in Ilford, Essex, which may be closed later this year. Mr Grayling’s intervention comes as Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS medical director, launches a review into how emergency services are organised, warning that the number of closures could accelerate because ‘large-scale reorganisation’ is needed. In a strongly worded email, Mr Grayling told constituents last week: ‘It is very obvious that our own local doctors should have the main input in what happens. And yet the provisional recommendations have been put forward without them even having the chance to have their say. ‘I have therefore written to all of our local GPs to ask them their views on the future of Epsom. If a good majority of our local doctors say they want to see changes, we will have to listen to them. But at the moment things seem to be moving ahead without them even having the chance to express their views.’ Concern: Epsom General Hospital could lose its A&E department if controversial plans go ahead . And he added: ‘I hope the people who are carrying out this review realise today just how much they have effectively stuck two fingers up at Surrey residents in the way that this has started.’ The ‘Better Services, Better Value’ review was originally being carried out into four hospitals in South-West London: St Helier (Sutton), Kingston, Croydon and St George’s (Tooting), but last week South West London NHS said it was being extended to include Epsom. Proposals include having three hospitals with A&E and maternity units, meaning others could be downgraded or closed. Mr Grayling has claimed some of the financial difficulties at Epsom Hospital have come as a result of losing some  services to private providers. However, his intervention was last night described as ‘hypocrisy’ by Shadow Health spokesman Andrew Gwynne because he backed the Health Bill, which opened up the NHS to competition from the  private sector. Mr Gwynne said: ‘Grayling is not the first Tory Cabinet Minister to be caught out. Now it’s coming home to roost, Ministers might think again about ignoring local concerns and axeing A&E units to save cash.’ Under threat: The entrance to the Accident and Emergency department at Epsom General Hospital . The threat to Epsom brings the total number of A&Es around the country that could be closed or downgraded to 34. Mr Hunt himself staged a prolonged fight against the closure of his local hospital, the Royal Surrey in Guildford, when it was threatened in 2006. The campaign, which saw him join a candlelight vigil outside Westminster, was a success. The latest plans threatening London hospitals mean nine A&Es in the capital now face the axe, leaving questions over how overstretched emergency services will cope. A London Ambulance Service spokesman said it would need ‘additional funding’ to meet the extra demand caused by changes to the local NHS. He said: ‘We are facing increasing pressure and we cannot absorb additional demand as a result of changes to local NHS services, particularly the closure of emergency departments. As well as the impact of increased journey times and potential increases in patient handover times at hospital, our experience shows that changes in NHS services can lead to increases in referrals to us from healthcare professionals.’ The regulator, the Care Quality Commission (CQC), has criticised poor staffing levels at the London Ambulance Service, which have contributed to delays in response times for less urgent calls and led to staff training being cancelled. Concerned: Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said A&E units were struggling . The number of people waiting longer than four hours for treatment in A&E has rocketed by 20 per cent in a year. More than 600,000 people have spent over four hours waiting during 2012-13 so far – 100,000 more than in the same period the previous year. Revealing the figures, Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said A&Es units were struggling to cope and ‘suffering from David Cameron’s toxic mix of cuts and reorganisation’. The Government expects 95 per cent of all people attending A&E  to be seen within four hours. But in the week ending  January 13, only 92 per cent of patients were seen within that  time frame in major A&E units. It is the 16th consecutive week that the NHS has missed the target. A CQC report published last month said: ‘There were not enough qualified, skilled and experienced staff to meet people’s needs. ‘Staffing levels should be reviewed and increased in light of increased demand on the service and to ensure that staff have sufficient time for breaks and training.’ The report also highlighted problems with missing or damaged equipment in ambulances which was putting patients at risk. In one case, a paramedic crew did not have a mechanical suction device when attending to a patient who was  choking. In the end a kit was borrowed from other professionals on the scene. Matthew Hopkins, chief executive for Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust, said: ‘No decisions have been made about which sites will be affected and further work needs to be done to determine whether the recommendations would work in practice.’ A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘We have always been clear about changes to A&E – they are local decisions, they must have support of local clinicians and existing services cannot be withdrawn until new and better arrangements are up and running.’","The emergency ward at Epsom Hospital in Surrey is under threat following controversial new proposals .

A deadly bug that has claimed thousands of lives around the world began in North America, a study has found. Scientists traced the origins of Clostridium difficile (C.diff) to two separate drug-resistant strains that emerged in the US and Canada. Both produce tough spores that spread easily over long distances - even between continents - and are hard to eradicate. However, the scientists said they didn't know if the bug spread due to international travel as they were following the trail of the pathogen rather than infected people. The strains, FQR1 and FQR2, went on to spark a global epidemic in the early to mid 2000s. Scroll down for video . The second drug-resistant strain of C difficile (FQR2), arrived from North America in 2003. This map reveals how scientists believe it then spread around the UK . C.diff is a bacterium that infects the gut, causing diarrhoea, fever and cramps. In some cases, infection can lead to life-threatening complications. Those most at risk are people in hospital taking broad-spectrum . antibiotics, those with serious underlying conditions and the elderly. However, at the height of the outbreak in 2006, Nicola Redfern, 32, became the first healthy young person to die from the infection in Britain. The mother from Staffordshire died less than two weeks after having a son after a series of doctors failed to diagnose the superbug, which she picked up in hospital. By 2007, there were almost 53,000 reported cases of C.diff infection in England. Urgent counter measures taken against the bug saw the number of English cases fall dramatically to 17,414 in 2011. Scientists writing in the journal Nature . Genetics told how they used a global collection of samples from . hospital patients to map the progress of both epidemic C.diff strains. C.diff is a bacterium (see right) that can cause . diarrhoea, fever and cramps. It can lead to life-threatening infections . to vulnerable patients in hospitals. C.diff spores are highly resistant to most cleaning materials, therefore hand washing is very important . Nicola Redfern, 32, died from C. difficile in 2006 two weeks after giving birth to her son Zachary . Lead researcher Dr Miao He, from the . Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridgeshire, said: 'Between 2002 . and 2006, we saw highly publicised outbreaks of C. difficile in . hospitals across the UK, USA, Canada and Europe. 'We . used advanced DNA sequencing to determine the evolutionary history of . this epidemic and the subsequent pattern of global spread. 'We . found that this outbreak came from two separate epidemic strains or . lineages of C. difficile, FQR1 and FQR2, both emerging from North . America over a very short period and rapidly spread between hospitals . around the world.' Co-author Professor Brendan Wren, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said until the early 2000s, the antibiotic fluoroquinoline was an effective treatment for C.diff. But the North American strains both proved resistant to the drug, making it useless. 'We've seen that since these strains acquired resistance to this frontline antibiotic, not only is . it now virtually useless against this organism, but resistance seems to have been a major factor in the continued . evolution and persistence of these strains in hospitals and clinical settings,' said Prof Wren. The first outbreak strain of C.diff, FQR1, originated in the Pittsburgh area of the U.S in 2001 and quickly spread across the country, before jumping to south Korea and Switzerland. It was followed by FQR2 which emerged in 2003 from the Montreal area in Canada, and spread rapidly over a much wider area, covering the whole of North America and reaching out to Europe and Australia. Clostridium difficile infection is a type of bacterial infection that can affect the digestive system. It most commonly affects people who are staying in hospital. The symptoms, that can range in severity, include diarrhoea, fever and painful abdominal cramps. It can also cause life threatening complications such as severe swelling of the bowel due to a build-up of gas. Spores of the bacteria are passed out in faeces and can survive for months on surfaces. If you touch the contaminated surface and then your nose and mouth you can ingest it. It doesn't cause problems in most healthy people but C.diff can multiply and produce toxins in the guts of people taking antibiotics. Treatment includes withdrawing the antibiotic causing the problem or using the antibiotics vancomycin or metronidazole. SOURCE: NHS . Tracking the spread of C.diff to the . UK, the researchers pinpointed separate transmissions from North America . to Exeter, Ayrshire and Birmingham. Another transmission event brought . the bug from continental Europe to Maidstone in Kent. These events triggered large scale C.diff outbreaks in many UK hospitals. 'We . have exposed the ease and rapidity with which these . fluoroquinolone-resistant C. difficile strains have transmitted across . the world,' said Dr Trevor Lawley, another member of the Sanger . Institute team. 'Our research highlights how the global healthcare system is interconnected and how we all need to work together when an outbreak such as this occurs. 'Our study heralds a new era of forensic microbiology for the transmission tracking of this major global pathogen and will now help us understand at the genetic level how and why this pathogen has become so aggressive and transmissible worldwide. 'This research will act as a database for clinical researchers to track the genomic changes in C. difficile outbreaks.'","C.difficile sparked a global epidemic in hospitals in the early 2000s .

Mother-of-four Jo, 34, from Essex, had struggled with her weight ever since giving birth to the couple's first child, and had soon ballooned to 17 stone and larger than a size 22. Before and after: Jo with husband Kevin before losing the weight, left, and with Kevin and baby Fearne after losing almost five stone while he was on tour in Afghanistan . But Kevin's absence provided just the . kick she needed to drop four dress sizes and slim down 12 stone, a size . 14, the same size she was before starting a family. Jo . had been gradually piling on the pounds during her 14 year marriage - . particularly after the birth of each of their four children, Liam, 14, . James, eight, Kieran, five and 18-month-old Fearne - but when Kevin . suggested they renew their wedding vows the . thought of walking down the aisle, almost ten dress sizes larger, forced .

And . eighteen months after her first slimming class, Jo slipped into a size . 14 dress - the same size as her original wedding dress - and walked down . the aisle to renew her wedding vows. She said: 'We'd planned to renew our vows for our 10th wedding anniversary but I just didn't feel confident and knew the photographs would be horrible as I was so much bigger than when we first got married. 'I'd slowly put on weight having children and when Kevin went to Afghanistan I knew it was a good time to do something about it.' Sweet tooth: Jo, pictured before her dramatic weight loss, dropped four dress sizes by swapping cake and takeaway for fruit and vegetables . Jo continued: 'He was away for six months and I lost a stone and a half, I felt so great I carried on. Kevin was back and fourth for the next year and each time he returned I'd lost more weight. 'He was very shocked when he first saw me and couldn't believe how much my shape had changed, but he's proud of what I've achieved.' To lose the pounds, Jo swapped takeaways and chocolate for fruit and vegetables. She also started working out at the gym twice a week and took up Zumba dance classes.

She said: 'It took a lot of hard work but it was worth it, especially when you see the weight start to come off. The real milestone for me was when I could get into clothes that I hadn't been able to get into for years. 'My lifestyle has changed so much, I feel a lot healthier now and not so out of breath. I finally have the confidence to go into the room and not worry that people are staring at me.' Jo and Kevin renewed their vows at Wimbish Church near their home in Essex last month. And just eighteen months after struggling to fit in a size 22, Jo walked up the aisle the same dress size as when the couple first married 14 years ago. Wedding days: Kevin and Jo have now renewed their marriage vows, and Jo was thrilled to be able to wear a dress the same size as the one she wore on her wedding day 15 years earlier .

Super-snitches have pocketed more than £1 million for helping catch tax-dodgers since the banking crisis began in 2008, it was revealed today. Huge taxpayer-funded 'bounty payments' of up to £100,000 have been handed out by HM Revenue & Customs to try to clamp down on evasion. Cash rewards given to members of the public rose by more than a fifth in the last year, probably because more people were trying to avoid the 50p rate of income tax, experts say. And the Government says that disgruntled spouses, family members, neighbours or colleagues are among the people who successfully snitched. Tax credit: Members of the public who successfully shopped people dodging tax have received huge sums of money in the last 5 years . In 2008 HMRC even paid £100,000 to an . individual who provided details of secret bank accounts held by wealthy . Britons in Liechtenstein. A total of £374,000 was paid-out by HMRC in 2011-12, figures released under the Freedom of Information Act show. This with compares with £309,620 in 2010-11, £384,110 in 2009-10, £281,000 in 2008-09, and £155,950 in 2007-08. Stephen Camm, tax partner at PwC, the accountancy giant, suggested that the increase in the top rate of income tax to 50 per cent in 2010 could be a factor in the rising payouts. 'When tax rates go up, there is more evasion,' he said. 'I would not like to see this turned into a career.' Figures published by investigative website Exaro revealed how individuals have been handed the cash for information that leads to the recovery of unpaid tax. Curtain-twitchers: 70,000 people called the tax evasion hotline last year - although not all received payment. HMRC claims that most payments are for low amounts - £50 or £60 - and are paid out following calls to its tax evasion hotline. But information that leads to higher sums of unpaid tax being recovered can trigger payments running to some much larger amounts. 'It can range from someone who has heard someone bragging in the pub about work they have done cash-in-hand, to details of someone shipping in lorry loads of vodka with paying tax', an HMRC spokesman said. The payments are based on the amount of unpaid tax that is recovered but there is no formula or fixed percentage basis for the rewards. HMRC said that 70,000 people called their tax evasion hotline last year, but that only a small proportion of these would have received payments. The handouts are at the discretion of officers and are only paid once unpaid tax has actually been recovered. A spokesman said: 'The system works in the same way as Crime Stoppers - sometimes there will be cash rewards to help persuade the public to come forward. Officers review all calls and must decide which ones to open investigations into, watching out for malicious and incorrect information.' HMRC says the payments to informants represents good value for money in the fight against illegal tax evasion. There are no up-to-date figures for the level of tax recovered as a result of information from paid informants, but figures for the period between 2005 and 2009 showed £42million was clawed back by the taxman this way. This week pupils were being encouraged to shop tax dodgers to their teachers. Tax . officers have developed teaching modules for schools in which . youngsters are asked if they know anyone ‘in their local area’ who is . not paying their fair share. HMRC said it did not use the scheme to collect information about tax evaders from children. But critics said it was ‘un-British’ of the taxman to try to turn ‘children into state spies’.","One person was paid £100,000 for helping stop an offshore tax-dodge .

He says he's currently working on legislation with Sen Patrick Leahy for 'mandatory minimums.' Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Rand Paul says that he's not necessarily for marijuana legalization, but believes that prison sentences for such a crime should be significantly reduced . Pot's punishment: Paul says that he doesn't want to promote marijuana use, but he doesn't want to throw people in jail for making that mistake . Paul told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace: 'I don't want to promote that but I also don't want to put people in jail who make the mistake. 'There are a lot of young people who do this and then later on in their 20s, they grow up and get married and they quit doing things like this, I don't want to put them in jail and ruin their lives.' He added: 'There are people in jail for 37, 50, 45 years for nonviolent crimes. And that's a huge mistake. Or prisons are full of nonviolent criminals.' I don't want to encourage people to do it. I think even marijuana is a bad thing to do. I think it takes away your incentive to work and show up and do the things that you should be doing. I don't think it's a good idea. Invoking reported drug use of President Obama and George W. Bush, Paul went on: 'Look, the last two presidents could conceivably have been put in jail for their drug use, and I really think, you know, look what would have happened, it would have ruined their lives. High times: Paul says that if Presidents Bush and Obama had been caught smoking pot, 'it would have ruined their lives' 'They got lucky, but a lot of poor kids, particularly in the inner city, don't get lucky. They don't have good attorneys, and they go to jail for these things and I think it's a big mistake.' Paul gained national acclaim among conservatives earlier this month when he performed a 13-hour filibuster objecting to the administration's targeted drone strike policy. Boosted by that notoriety, Paul put himself in the forefront of early presidential candidate speculation by winning this year's CPAC straw poll with 25 per cent of the vote.

CCTV footage from one attack on their £500,000 crime spree shows a mother sprinting to protect her terrified son as the eight men swamped and then burgled a Carphone Warehouse. On each occasion the criminals caused 'total mayhem' when they stormed high street shops to wrench high-value items from the walls in a series of violent 'steaming' raids. In scenes reminiscent of the recent London Riots, phones and tablet computers worth a total . of £143,000 were ripped out by the thieves, while the attacks caused more than £50,000 . worth of damage.

Violence: As the gang terrorise another store a mother is shown sweeping her young son away from them (bottom right) as they go on the rampage . The criminals, some of whom were just 14, . used the 'steaming' technique, where they rob shops or mug individuals by . swamping them and threatening them with violence. The clean-up operation after the raids, which forced some stores to close temporarily, resulted in Carphone Warehouse losing a total of more than £500,000, the court heard. Passing sentence, Judge Peter Testar said: 'This conspiracy to burgle consists of a series of offences in which a number of young men rushed into branches of Carphone Warehouse and simply grabbed whatever they were able to and ran away. 'In some cases, efforts were made to . disguise appearances, but in many cases the attitude of those who . committed these offences was brazen. 'Those . who have joined the conspiracy have applied themselves to a criminal . operation of which the overall effect was very great. 'The targeting of particular premises and the mob handed means of offending indicates greater harm. 'The success (of the conspiracy) depended on force of numbers and shock. 'Many staff and customers were very frightened. 'In . one incident, a small child found himself, much to his terror and that . of his parents, being surrounded by the marauding group. 'Most of the events saw participation by more than those who have admitted responsibility for them.' Sentenced: (Top L - Bottom R) Ugo Wilson, Jahreau Shepherd, Emmanuel Kakala, and Perry Hedges were part of the gang that raided 40 stores in a £500,000 crime spree across London . Judge Testar also praised the 'good old fashioned police work' involved in bringing the gang to justice. The 'steaming' spree took place between July 1, 2012 and January 11 this year, prosecutor Edward Lucas told the court. 'The . defendants had a total disregard for the presence of customers, old or . young, when they were embarking on their criminal enterprise. 'They were always mob handed and caused total chaos. Children were pushed out of the way and forced to run away. 'These . young men, of various ages, with the youngest being just 14 at the time . of the ending, targeted Carphone Warehouses through the London and . Greater London area. 'In . groups of three or more, they went into the premises, mostly during the . afternoon, and literally ripped telephones from their displays.

'There was a menace, don't mess with us, if you get in the way there is going to be trouble,' said Mr Lucas. 'The . staff say they were extremely shocked and frightened by what occurred. They were not only frightened for themselves but also for their . customers. 'The . psychological effect cannot be minimised and the reality is that the . consequences (for shop staff and' customers) have been profound. More thugs who took part in the raids remain at large and none of the goods have been recovered. 'The . fact of the matter is the crimes themselves seem to have occurred . within the context of the individuals really not caring who is in the . shop at the time. 'They went in to steal and caused total mayhem,' added Mr Lucas. Jahreau . Shepherd, 22, who was on licence for robbery at the time of the . attacks, was jailed for four years, while Ugo Wilson, 21, was given a . 27-month prison term. Ryan .

In 1880, Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky was commissioned to produce the 1812 Overture to commemorate Russia's defence against Napoleon.

"By . Becky Barrow . PUBLISHED: . 20:39 EST, 25 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:13 EST, 26 March 2013 . Around 630,000 families in Britain are in negative equity, which means their mortgage is larger than the current value of their home, an official report revealed yesterday. The report, from Britain’s new regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, warns more families might be dragged into negative equity if house prices keep on falling. Its report, published yesterday, warns: ‘For those holding a mortgage, price falls can leave homeowners with little or negative equity in their homes. The south of England appears to have fewer people in negative equity while more than a quarter of people in Northern Ireland are suffering . There are 630,000 families are trapped in negative equity as their mortgages are larger than the value of their homes . ‘This can leave borrowers with unsustainable burdens of debt, unable to move and restricted in their options to remortgage onto better rates.’ Homeowners in the North have been hit much harder than those in the South, unlike the recession in the early 1990s, according to the report. This is because house prices have plunged in many parts of the North since the financial crisis struck five years ago, but many parts of the South have been protected. The average home in the North East has dropped from £127,900 in August 2007 - the month that the credit crunch struck - to £99,295 today. By comparison, the average price of a home in London has reached an all-time high of £373,210, according to the figures from the Land Registry. The FCA’s report says one in ten homeowners in both the North East and the North West are in negative equity, compared to only three per cent in the South West and the South East. As house prices fall there is the risk of more homeowners falling into negative equity . Negative equity creates a major problem for the homeowner because they cannot sell their home without owing a large sum to their lender. As a result, victims find themselves trapped in their property, unable to sell unless they can find the extra cash. This is a particular problem if they need to move because they have found a job in a different part of the country, or need a larger home to accommodate an expanding family. To make matters worse, the FCA’s report may even under-estimate the scale of the negative equity nightmare facing thousands of Britons. The Council of Mortgage Lenders estimates the figure is even higher, with an estimated 720,000 homeowners in negative equity. This is far lower than it was during the early 1990s when it peaked at 1.6million. Repossessions are also lower, with banks and building societies under pressure to be lenient to homeowners, such as offering to cut their monthly payments by extending the life of the loan. Yesterday Martin Wheatley, chief executive designate of the FCA, said it is ‘a very uncomfortable position’ for homeowners in negative equity. He added: ‘If interest rates rise, it may become much more of a problem.’ Interest rate are at an historic low of 0.5 per cent, and have been frozen at this level for four years.The debt charity, Step Change, described the figures as ‘alarming’ and said negative equity can be ‘a trap’ for many homeowners. Campbell Robb, chief executive of the charity Shelter, said: “The impacts of negative equity can be devastating, in particular for people who have to sell their homes, leaving them chased for crippling levels of debt and often without a permanent roof over their heads. ‘Given the performance of the property market immediately before the recession started, many people entered into homeownership thinking that when it came to house prices, the only way was up. ‘The past few years have left many people in very difficult circumstances they would never have foreseen.’ Many families are being squeezed by rising living costs and falling house values . Overall, the report paints a bleak picture of the financial troubles facing many families as a result of the financial crisis, with people feeling ‘squeezed by rising living costs.’ It says: ‘The true impact of the recession has been masked to date by wage cuts, temporary unpaid leave or reduced hours, and the rise in part-time and self-employment. ‘While these measures have prevented a complete loss of income, they have reduced incomes for those affected.’ The FCA, which takes over from the Financial Services Authority next month, said the lack of pension saving has created a hole which is ‘too big to fill for a lot of households and will leave many with insufficient future income.’","630,000 families have mortgages that are larger than value of their homes .

From the single person on £75,000 to a couple on £17,000 with two children, this graphic lays bare how you will be affected by tax changes from April. Chancellor George Osborne announced today that the £10,000 personal tax allowance threshold will be reached in 2014, a year ahead of schedule. But one analyst said the Budget largely ignored individuals and warned that the gains for all groups in this graphic do not take account of inflation. Graphic: One analyst told MailOnline that the Budget largely ignored individuals and warned that the gains for all groups in this graphic do not take account of inflation . Tim Gregory, partner at Saffery Champness chartered accountants, told MailOnline: ‘Take something like “married couple with two schoolage children”. ‘If they've got gross income of £50,000, . their gain of £113 is 0.2 per cent. Take out the inflation and they're . worse off to the tune of about 2 per cent.’ He added: ‘There was much more done (in the Budget) at the lower level of income and it was positive. There was virtually nothing done, either positively or negatively, for those on higher income. ‘You've also got the new employment allowance allowing a £2,000 cut in national insurance for an employer who's taking on new employees. ‘I don't think there’s any particular incentive to have children, but there is more help. People are encouraged financially if they do have children.’ Mr Gregory used the graphic to compare the unmarried couple with two schoolage children and the married pensioner couple under 75. He said: ‘You can see that the couple with the children are benefiting a lot more. The incomes are broadly similar. So that suggests additional help.’ Another graphic (right) also showed a highly-paid professional earning less than twice the other one will be gaining more than twice the other. Mr Gregory said: ‘It's simply because the richer one is currently paying tax at 50 per cent on far more of their income than the other one. ‘So the cut to 45 per cent will benefit that person, so it's really only to be expected as a result of the tax cut coming in next month.’ Bringing forward the allowance rise to £10,000 will mean a cumulative cash benefit for typical basic rate taxpayers of £705 since the Coalition began. From April, it will go up as planned to £9,440 - a £200 boost for 24million taxpayers. The basic and higher rates of income tax will remain the same. It will also mean 2.7 million working age adults have been taken out of income tax altogether in the new financial year. Mr Osborne said: ‘It's a historic achievement for this government and for hard-working families across the country.’ The Government has also stuck by its decision to reduce the top rate of tax on earnings over £150,000 from 50p to 45p next month. Campaign group the TaxPayers' Alliance said the personal allowance increase would help to ease the burden of high living costs.","Single person earning £15,000 will gain £286 in 2013/14 ++ Single person earning £6,000 with one child will gain £165 .

Pushy: The NRA has been calling residents in Newtown, Connecticut as the town struggles to come to terms with the loss of 20 first-graders and six teachers in the Sandy Hook shooting . Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the NRA, has said his organization supports getting the records of those adjudicated mentally incompetent and dangerous into the background check system for gun dealers and beefed up penalties for illegal third-party purchases and gun trafficking. Shortly after the Newtown shooting, LaPierre also called for armed security guards in schools. A 20-year-old gunman killed 26 students and educators and himself at Sandy Hook on December 14, after having shot his mother to death at their Newtown home. Another Newtown resident, Christopher Wenis, said that he received three of the NRA's robocalls last week. 'I've got a five-year-old son who went to preschool on the Sandy Hook Elementary School campus,' Wenis said. 'And this was a really hard week for me on a lot of levels. These calls were the very last thing I needed.'","Gunman killed 20 first-graders and six teaching staff at school on December 14 .

Actor Simon Morris, 42, pictured, pretended he suffered from sexsomnia after raping a 15-year-old girl at a house party . An actor who claimed he was sleepwalking when he assaulted a teenage girl was jailed yesterday. Simon Morris, 42, said he had ‘sexsomnia’ and did not remember attacking the 15-year-old. But a jury decided his defence was all an act, and yesterday Judge Daniel Williams sentenced him to eight years for rape. Morris, a bit-part performer who has appeared in Hollyoaks, attacked the girl after a house party. He went into her bedroom when she was asleep, but told a court he had no memory of sex, saying: ‘I have a history of sleepwalking, checking my phone, gyrating against door frames and having sex with partners in my sleep.’ Yesterday the judge said: ‘I do not accept that you do not recollect the attack. You told an endless number of glib lies. 'You were unrelenting in pursuit of your victim. You tried to chat her up, boasting about your career. ‘You played the role of nice guy and you deployed the acting skills you boasted about.’ He added: ‘You have shown no remorse and the only thing that has burdened you is self-pity.’ In recent years, a string of men accused of rape and sexual assault have claimed they were suffering sexsomnia and were not in control. Sexsomnia is a medical condition which causes sufferers to carry out sexual acts in their sleep. It is related to other sleeping conditions, or ‘parasomnias’, such as sleepwalking. It can cause great distress for genuine sufferers, who are mostly male. Of 18 known rape cases in which sexsomnia was used as a defence in British courts from 1996 to 2011, 12 ended in acquittals, one Scottish case was found ‘not proven’ and only five ended in guilty verdicts. Cardiff Crown Court heard the claim was a ‘feeble excuse to escape the inevitable’. Morris raped the teenager at a party after she had been put to bed by her father. The prosecutor told the court that Morris had winked at the girl and asked her to stay with him in London during the party . Prosecutor Sue Ferrier said Morris ‘took an interest in the girl – winking at her, helping her pour drinks and even offering her to stay with him’. She said: ‘The girl got drunk on cocktails and her father put her to sleep. The girl’s father tried to wake his daughter at 6am to go home, but as she was fast asleep he left her in the bed for the night. By 6.30am the girl was crying rape.’ The girl’s statement to police described how she woke to see Morris standing in front of her, touching her sexually. He had sex with her before leaving, when the ‘full horror’ hit, she said. Morris’s girlfriend Helen Cole stood by him and told police he once tried to have sex with her in his sleep. Morris, who lives in London, appeared on Hollyoaks in 2001 and with Michael Caine in the 2000 film Shiner. He had been found guilty of rape by a jury in December. Yesterday he was jailed for eight years and ordered to register as a sex offender for life.","Simon Morris, 42, targeted the 15-year-old girl at a house party .

Charged: Former PCSO Peter Bunyan is on trial at Taunton Crown Court, charged with abusing his position to have affairs with five women and having sex with them while on duty . A police worker accused of having sex with several women while on duty was no worse than John Major, a court heard yesterday. The lawyer defending Peter Bunyan, a married police community support officer, compared his client to the former prime minister, who had an affair with Edwina Currie. Bunyan is accused of neglecting his duties by turning down his police radio on shifts before having sex with women he met through work. He also allegedly accessed highly sensitive police data to perform background checks on the women, some of whom had mental health issues, and their former partners. Yesterday his defence lawyer, Michael Melville-Shreeve, told the court Bunyan was a ‘rat’ – but said the prosecution case was ‘piffle’. He said: ‘The prosecution say if he’s off duty having sex with these women: not misconduct. If he’s on duty, if he’d stopped off to have tea with them or coffee with them: not misconduct. But if he has sex with them, it is misconduct. Why? How is that? ‘He [Bunyan] is a rat. He’s a disgrace as a married man. But somehow, my learned friend [prosecution counsel Simon Burns] wants to turn that into criminal misconduct. ‘If it’s not serious crime to have tea with someone for half an hour, it is not a crime to have sex consensually with them.’ Referring to the four-year affair between Sir John and former minister Edwina Currie, Mr Melville-Shreeve said: ‘What about John Major and Edwina Currie? ‘She’s even written a book about it. That was a public office. I don’t know if it was on duty or off duty. I don’t know whether a prime minister is ever off duty.’ He continued: ‘I remember people were raucous about those Conservatives. But it is not a crime. Nobody ever called for their prosecution.’ Bunyan, a father of two, denies 12 counts of misconduct in a public office, over a five-year period in the Camborne and Redruth areas of west Cornwall. Of the five women he is accused of sleeping with, he admits having sex with four, but said it happened in his own time. All of the women said the sex was . consensual. Earlier, prosecutor Mr Burns had argued that Bunyan, of . Carharrack near Camborne, ‘was not there when the public needed him’. On trial: Police community support officer Peter Bunyan (pictured, left, outside court and, right, in his uniform) is accused of using highly sensitive police data to strike up affairs with vulnerable women while on duty . He told the court: ‘He abused his position as a police officer. ‘He’s targeted vulnerable individuals . who are either people who have suffered from mental issues or . individuals who have been at the receiving end of violence. ‘He has conducted sexual relationships, totally and utterly inappropriately, while on duty. ‘He’s ignored police radio transmissions while on duty, while turning down the radio or turning it off. Redruth police station, where Bunyan would openly view explicit pictures of his victims . He added: ‘He has accessed the police computer . system without legitimate policing purpose. It is clearly a conflict of . interest with his work.’ But Mr Melville-Shreeve described the . prosecution case as ‘piffle’, saying: ‘The police are desperate to get . him [Bunyan] because he is one of their own.’ He added: ‘[Bunyan] is a disgrace to the uniform. He should be publicly humiliated. But he’s not a serious criminal.’ Bunyan, who has been suspended from Devon and Cornwall police, denies all charges. The trial at Taunton Crown Court continues.

He was one on the most closely guarded prisoners of all time, with a strong Royal Navy squadron of 11 ships patrolling the South Atlantic island where he was kept 1,200 miles from the nearest land. Plots to rescue the French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte included those using yachts, steamboats and even balloons, but the most extraordinary of all of them was said to have involved a submarine. Tom Johnson, who was born in 1772 and had worked as a smuggler since the age of 12, claimed he was offered £40,000 in 1820 to rescue Napoleon from exile on St Helena, it was reported on Friday. Smuggler's plan: Tom Johnson (left), who was born in 1772 and had worked as a smuggler since the age of 12, claimed he was offered £40,000 in 1820 to rescue Napoleon (right, in exile on St Helena), it has been reported . The fascinating escape plan was to have Napoleon sat in a boatswain's chair and taken down a sheer cliff to two primitive submarines, according to an essay in the U.S. Smithsonian Magazine. Napoleon, who was exiled to Elba, Italy, after defeat in 1814, escaped and returned to France before being beaten again at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 and imprisoned by the British on St Helena. But Napoleon was supported by South America, which was backed by him when it was trying to gain independence from Spain, and he had ambitions of launching a new empire in Mexico or Venezuela. 'Napoleon’s political ambition was not subdued by his captivity,' historian Emilio Ocampo wrote, reported Smithsonian. 'And his determined followers never abandoned hopes of setting him free.' Underwater: Robert Fulton's submarine from 1806, which is believed to be the inspiration for Johnson's designs and has many similarities to the smuggler's crafts . The escape plans were hatched despite Napoleon being confined to an astonishing secure prison for the era, which was guarded by 2,800 men and 500 cannon on its handful of possible landing ports. An account from 1835 explains how Johnson would have landed with a ‘mechanical chair, capable of containing one person on the seat, and a standing foot-board at the back’. Johnson would have scaled the cliffs, put an iron bolt and block at the summit and then made his way to the Longwood estate. There both he and Napoleon would have put on uniforms to make them appear to be with a coachman and escaped at night. They would then both come back down the cliff on the chair, where Napoleon would board the Etna and then be transferred to the Eagle. He spent six years on the heavily-guarded . island, in the refurbished Longwood mansion, where visitors were . thoroughly questioned and searched, before dying in May 1821, apparently . of cancer, reported Smithsonian. An account of Johnson’s plan was uncovered in an 1835 memoir, which described the 114-ton and 84ft-long steam-powered Eagle submarine, along with the 23-ton and 44ft-long Etna. The vessels were manned by 30 seaman and four engineers, and armed with 20 primitive torpedoes, which were said to have been enough to destroy that number of ships. Johnson’s story is supported by other sources, with one from 1823 saying that he had earlier  worked with U.S. engineer Robert Fulton, who was selling plans for an underwater boat. An illustration of an 1806 craft Fulton designed had many similarities to Johnson’s submarines, and Fulton had also created a small experimental craft for the French in 1800, which was successful. Looking out: Napoleon is pictured on St Helena in this painting by Francois-Joseph Sandmann. He spent six years on the heavily-guarded island, in the refurbished Longwood mansion . It's known that Johnson possessed a real submarine in 1820 but it’s not believed that Napoleon knew anything of the rescue plan being considered, reported Smithsonian. 'Napoleon's political ambition was not subdued by his captivity. And his determined followers never abandoned hopes of setting him free' Emilio Ocampo, historian . In fact, it’s also thought to be unlikely that Napoleon would have joined Johnson had he made it to Longwood, because he would not have wanted to escape under the disguise of a footman’s clothing. In the end, Johnson was said to have been intercepted on the River Thames in London as he tried to run his submarine out to sea. According to one account, the craft was then burned by authorities in Blackwall, east London.","Tom Johnson claimed he was offered £40,000 in 1820 to rescue Napoleon .

Kevin Liverpool is alleged to have wrote his thoughts about Joss Stone, pictured leaving Exeter Crown Court on Tuesday, in a diary . One of the men accused of plotting to decapitate Joss Stone kept a list of potential targets in a diary – including Beyoncé and Girls Aloud, a court heard yesterday. Kevin Liverpool, 35, is said to have written down his alleged  violent plan in a notebook. Other stars mentioned in the scrawled pages are rapper Dizzee Rascal, Eminem, Craig David, R Kelly and Chris Brown, the jury was told. The court heard there were numerous urban slang words, such as ‘wet’ – meaning to stab someone until their clothes are soaked with blood – and ‘popo’ - short for police. One entry was said to read: ‘God doesn’t give a f***. Protect yourself from this. Remember Jocelyn Stone. 'God let her take the p***.’ Other notes mentioned the need to buy a semi-automatic gun, a gun holder, a silencer and infra-red equipment, as well as a ‘ninja sword’, it was said. Liverpool had also written a reminder to buy a hooded top, car insurance, a safe and open a bank account, the court was told. Liverpool and co-accused Junior Bradshaw, 32, are charged with plotting to rob and kill Miss Stone before dumping her body in a river in June 2011. The defendants, both of St Stephen’s Close, Manchester, deny charges of conspiracy to murder, conspiracy to cause GBH and conspiracy to rob. The diary was seized by police when they raided Liverpool’s one-bedroom flat in Longsight, Manchester, after he had been arrested in Devon. In the diary - a daily 2007 edition - each page was covered in handwritten scrawl, in either blue or black ink, with much of it crossed or scribbled out, the court was told. Detective Constable Katherine Joyner took the jury of 10 men and two women through the diary. In the diary other musical stars were . listed, such as British rapper Dizzee Rascal, Eminem, Beyonce, Craig . David, R Kelly, Chris Brown and Girls Aloud.

It's not the sort of fuss you would expect from the well-heeled residents of a sleepy market town – or a former Blue Peter presenter for that matter. But when it comes to the might of Tesco, the people of Sherborne in Dorset aren’t taking any chances. Out of a population of 9,350, some 8,500 people – including former Blue Peter presenter Valerie Singleton – have joined a campaign to stop the supermarket giant building a superstore near the town. Scroll down for video . Battle: The people of posh market town Sherborne have united in a David versus Goliath battle against a plan to build a Tesco store in their community . Polite: A protest group called 'No Thanks Tesco' has been launched. One of those backing the campaign is former Blue Peter presenter Valerie Singleton. She is pictured with Canon Eric Woods . And even though Tesco is yet to submit . a planning application to the council, the politely named No Thanks . Tesco group, backed by retail guru Mary Portas, has already held a . protest march. Hundreds took part, including Miss Singleton who carried a placard. She said: ‘It’s incredible how many . people have come along. I looked over my shoulder and I couldn’t believe . how many people were there.’ Tesco plans to buy a large hotel to . the north of Sherborne and turn it into a 28,000sq ft store, employing . 200 people, with more than 200 parking spaces. Currently the nearest Tesco outlets are six miles away in Yeovil which has a Tesco Extra and Tesco Express. Local people argue they do not need . another supermarket because there is a small Sainsbury’s and Co-op near . the town centre, while shopkeepers fear they will be forced out of . business if locals are tempted to bypass the high street in favour of . driving to a big supermarket. Campaign: Unlike most other British towns, historic Sherborne does not currently have a Tesco. Andrew Cross, head verger of Sherborne Abbey, is pictured at a protest . As part of the protest, several . businesses shut on Tuesday afternoon and boarded up their windows to . illustrate the impact a Tesco will have on trade. Local businessman Andrew Maddock, 53, . who owns a stationers, said: ‘If people go to Tesco for all of their . shopping they won’t be coming to the high street. ‘It’s the same as what is happening . all across the country, where Tesco opens a huge store on the edge of a . town and takes away the footfall from independent butchers, bakers and . candlestick makers.’ He added: ‘It feels like a David and Goliath situation, but we have to make a stand. ‘I don’t think Tesco has come up against this amount of opposition before they have even submitted a planning application.’ Peter Baker, co-owner of Parson’s . Butchers in Cheap Street, said: ‘We have been here since 1840 when my . great-great grandfather opened the shop. ‘There were four butcher shops here 30 years ago but now we are the only one left. ‘The problem is that because Tesco . will be about half-a-mile away, people will go there, and think “I can’t . be bothered to drive to Parson’s, let’s get the meat from here today”. ‘There will be fewer people on the high street so there will be fewer customers coming in and we will end up losing business. ‘Sherborne is a very quirky and unique town and a Tesco will make it just like any other.’ Steve Oxford, 32, of Oxfords Bakers, . said: ‘A Tesco store will pinch the high street and reduce footfall. It . would be absolute suicide for the council to accept this. ‘Tesco aren’t really in direct competition with us but if people stop coming into town it will affect us.’ Sherborne resident Lisa Smith, 48, a . married mother of four, said: ‘Anything that changes the fabric of the . town and makes it less attractive to live or do business in will affect . the quality of life here. ‘Historically, towns haven’t won in . these battles against Tesco but I think we should remain positive and . keep on working together. Everyone involved thinks we will win.' United: Virtually every resident of the ancient capital of Wessex is fighting to 'hold back the tide' and prevent Sherborne from turning into a 'Tesco Town'. Local business owners are pictured . Fears for independent stores: Shopkeepers boarded up their windows in protest at the plans . Peter Neal, 74, chairman of the . Sherborne branch for the Campaign to Protect Rural England, fears the . Tesco store would jeopardise Sherborne achieving heritage town status, . which is vital for future tourism. He said: ‘The gateway into the town . would be a mighty Tesco store. We have 350 listed buildings, Sherborne . is an incredibly historic town and that’s what people come to see. But . the problem is the mighty Tesco tends to trample over small towns like . ours.’ On the No Thanks Tesco website and . under the sub-heading ‘A Little Dorset town v.

A statement adds: ‘We cannot . underestimate the impact Tesco would have on the very fabric of the town . centre and our way of life.’ Yesterday a Tesco spokesman said: ‘We . are consulting with local people on our proposals and have not submitted . an application.

The Statue of Liberty will re-open on the Fourth of July, nearly eight months after the fierce winds and flooding caused damage to the island on which it stands. When the ferocious hurricane hit late last October, Lady Liberty had only recently reopened following a $30million refurbishment. But Liberty Island itself was badly damaged, with the floodwaters breaking railings, washing away paving stones, and destroying electrical systems. The statue remained unlit until the second week of November. Luck be a lady: The Statue of Liberty, pictured on October 27, will re-open on the Fourth of July following damage to its island during Superstorm Sandy . Unsafe harbor: High surf battered the Hudson River near the Statue of . Liberty hours before October's deadly storm; while the statue was undamaged, Liberty Island needed significant repair work done . Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar, joined by New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, announced the re-opening plans today. 'Hurricane Sandy inflicted major . damage on facilities that support the Statue of Liberty,' Salazar said. 'Based on the tremendous progress we have made, Lady Liberty will be . open to the public in time for the July 4th celebration.' As much as three-fourths of Liberty . Island's 12 acres was flooded, officials estimated, with water reaching . as high as eight feet. The rest of New York Harbor was greatly damaged . as well. Sandy came one day after the Statue of . Liberty's 126th birthday and the reopening of the crown, which had been . closed for a year for a $30 million upgrade to fire alarms, sprinkler . systems and exit routes. Long walk: There are also more stairs than ever before inside, with a daunting 393 steps to the crown, where there were previously 354 slightly steeper steps . Monument: A park ranger conducts a tour of the Statue of Liberty last week before Superstorm Sandy hit . Designed by Frederic Bartholdi, the statue is a neo-classical sculpture based on the Roman Goddess of Freedom, Libertas. She was a present to the US from France to celebrate independence and was erected in 1886 in Upper New York Bay on Liberty Island. Bartholdi's inspiration for the statue was a comment made by politician Édouard René de Laboulaye in mid-1865. He stated: 'If a monument should rise in the United States, as a memorial to their independence, I should think it only natural if it were built by united effort - a common work of both our nations.' She makes for a truly exhilarating sight for anyone entering New York. The main body of the statue stands at 151ft high, but with the pedestal included, reaches 305ft. According to the Associated Press, . around 3.7 million people visited the statue in 2011, making it the 19th . most visited national park. Schumer stressed the importance the statue has on New York’s booming tourism economy. 'Being open for the summer tourism . season isn't just important symbolically, it's a boon to the city's . economy and businesses, as the statue attracts millions of tourists from . all over the world to our shores,' he said. Sandy also inflicted major damage on . nearby Ellis Island, though officials weren’t clear on when the historic . island would re-open. The . statue had been closed to the public since 2009 for repairs. The . renovation included replacing the stairs to the crown, as well as . creating wheelchair access to one of the observation decks at the top of . the pedestal. This year marked . the 126th anniversary of the Statue of Liberty’s dedication and the . renovation improved fire alarms, sprinkler systems and exit routes to . bring it in line with city safety codes. There . are also more stairs than ever before, with a daunting 393 steps to the . crown, where there were previously 354 slightly steeper steps. The . famous statue is 151ft from base to torch. It . sits atop the 89ft tall stone pedestal, which sits on a 65ft . tall foundation in the shape of a star. Meanwhile the . bathrooms have been upgraded for the first time since the 1980s. In addition a new air-conditioning system will cool the interior of the copper-clad monument, which previously could get up to 20F hotter than outdoors at the height of summer. About 3.5million people visit Liberty Island each year, although most don't go inside the statue. With the improvements, 26,000 more will be able to ascend to the crown each year. The statue, a gift from France to the US, was dedicated in 1886 and declared a national monument in 1924. In 2009, the crown was reopened to the public for the first time since the 9/11 attacks. Sandy was blamed for at least 98 . deaths across the U.S. and Canada, leaving New Jersey's barrier islands a . wasteland of eroded shoreline, ruined beachfront homes and flooded streets.

Common painkillers such as ibuprofen increase the risk of dying or having a second heart attack among heart attack survivors, researchers have warned. A study shows that taking the common painkillers can put those who have already had one heart attack at a heightened risk of having another for at least five years. The findings confirm the potential dangers of taking a group of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs known as NSAIDs. Warning: Common painkillers such as ibuprofen increase the risk of dying or having a second heart attack among heart attack survivors . Previous research found the painkillers are linked to a raised risk of heart attacks or stroke when taken in high doses for a long periods of time. Study leader Dr Anne-Marie Schjerning Olsen, a fellow in the cardiology department at Copenhagen University Hospital Gentofte in Denmark, said the study involved prescription drugs, but the widespread availability of ibuprofen in pharmacies was a matter for concern. She said: ‘It is important to get the message out to clinicians taking care of patients with cardiovascular disease that NSAIDs are harmful, even several years after a heart attack. ‘Allowing a drug to be sold without prescription must be perceived by the general public as a strong signal of safety, and may be contrary in this case.' Millions of Britons with arthritis are prescribed painkillers, including NSAIDs, some of whom have survived heart attacks. The researchers used national hospital and pharmacy registries in Denmark to identify almost 100,000 people 30 or older who had a first heart attack between 1997 and 2009, and to see if they were prescribed NSAIDs afterwards. The drugs included ibuprofen, sold over the counter in the UK with the brand name Nurofen, naproxen and Celebrex. Almost half of the patients collected at least one NSAID prescription, says a report in Circulation, an American Heart Association journal. Among those receiving an NSAID, risk of death from any cause was 59 per cent higher one year after their heart attack, and 63 per cent higher after five years. The risk of having another heart attack or dying from coronary artery disease was 30 per cent higher one year later and 41 per cent higher after five years. The findings considered other illnesses and medication use in the NSAID patients, as well as differences in age, sex, income and year of hospitalisation. The study did not look at aspirin, which is frequently recommended by doctors to heart attack survivors. Dr Schjerning Olsen said: ‘The results support previous findings suggesting that NSAIDs have no apparent safe treatment window among heart attack patients, and show that coronary risk related to using the drugs remains high, regardless of the time that has passed since the heart attack.’ Normally, patients who have a heart attack face higher risk of death or another heart attack within the first year. But the extra risk is gone within five to ten years. Because the new study instead showed a persistently higher risk over at least five years for patients on the drugs, ‘long-term caution with any use of NSAIDS is advised in all patients after heart attack’ said Dr Schjerning Olsen. Previous research found two non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, (NSAIDs) ibuprofen and diclofenac, could cause heart attacks when taken in high doses. Ibuprofen is one of the most popular over-the-counter painkillers available from pharmacists and supermarkets - with 46 tons sold here each year. Maureen Talbot, Senior Cardiac Nurse at the British Heart Foundation (BHF), said: ‘This study supports what we already know about these painkillers. The potential risks mean that this type of drug tends to be prescribed with caution and only taken for short periods. ‘It’s always a good idea to make sure you understand what your medication is for and are aware of any possible side effects. If you’ve had a heart attack, make sure you have a chat with your doctor before taking any extra tablets. ‘However, if you’re a heart attack survivor who has been prescribed these painkillers, don’t stop taking your medication. Book an appointment with your GP to talk through any concerns you might have.’",Taking anti-inflammatory drugs including Ibuprofen can put those who have already had one heart attack at a heightened risk of having another for at least five years .

Babies given Calpol and other forms of paracetamol are more likely to develop asthma before going to school, say Danish researchers . Babies given Calpol and other forms of paracetamol are more likely to develop asthma before going to school, say researchers. More exposure to the drug resulted in a greater chance of developing the condition. The latest study from Denmark adds to mounting evidence of a link between the painkiller and asthma, with previous research into adults and babies suggesting its use increased the risk of the disease. Scientists believe paracetamol may cause changes in the body that leave children more vulnerable to inflammation and allergies. The study published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology says paracetamol has not been proven to cause asthma. But senior researcher Hans Bisgaard, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Copenhagen, advised parents to only use the drug when needed, such as when a child has a fever. ‘We would like to stress that the use of this drug indeed is beneficial in the appropriate circumstances,’ he said. The study included 336 children who were followed from birth to age seven. All had mothers with asthma, which put them at increased risk for the lung disease themselves. Overall, 19 per cent of the children had asthma-like symptoms by the age of three, meaning recurrent bouts of wheezing, breathlessness or coughing. Prof Bisgaard's team found the risk generally went up the more often a child was given paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen in the first year of life. Scientists believe paracetamol may cause changes in the body that leave children more vulnerable to inflammation and allergies . For each doubling in the number of days a baby received the drug, there was a 28 per cent increase in the risk of asthma symptoms. The link disappeared, though, by the time the children were seven years old. At that point 14 per cent of the children had asthma, and the risk was no greater for those given the drug as babies. Researchers said children with asthma tend to get more severe respiratory infections so may have been given more medication as a result. One recent study found that children given other common pain medications, including ibuprofen and naproxen, also had an increased asthma risk. The researchers said that suggested children with asthma symptoms were simply more likely to need the medications. ‘We think it is too early to conclude a causal relationship, but the findings should encourage further research into a ‘plausible biological mechanism’. An international study, covering 300,000 teenagers in 50 countries, also found paracetamol users were more likely to suffer from the skin disorder eczema and allergic nasal conditions.","Danish study adds to mounting evidence of a link between the painkiller and asthma .

An SAS chief responsible for planning  top-secret operations in the Middle East was under armed protection last night after a life-threatening security blunder led to his identity being exposed on  the internet. The commander met high-ranking officers from a Middle Eastern country earlier this month to discuss joint operations between UK Special Forces and local troops. During the get-together a photograph was taken of the officers in their desert uniforms. This image and a report of the event should have been vetted by British officials before being released to the  media in the host country. Astonishingly, the leaking of the officer’s name and his role were discovered not by the Ministry of Defence or the Foreign Office but by this newspaper. An SAS chief responsible for planning top secret operations had his cover blown when this photograph for revealed . Due to his status, the man is considered a prime target for Islamic terrorist groups. The Mail on Sunday’s intervention triggered a tightening of his personal security arrangements. The MoD also thanked this newspaper for bringing the  matter to its attention and a spokesman insisted that efforts were being made to remove the material from websites. However, last night the image and the report of the SAS officer’s engagement with military officials remained online, raising the possibility that he may have to be flown back to Britain for his own safety. A blame-game also started, with Foreign Office sources denying responsibility for the leak, even though the event was staged at a British Embassy. A source suggested that  regardless of the venue, it was  up to the MoD and not the Foreign Office to put the necessary  security measures in place to protect personnel. Colonel Richard Kemp underlined the need to be careful with the internet . Military experts suggested the leak could compromise British intelligence-gathering in the  Middle East, in particular with regard to Iran, because foreign security agencies will glean vital information from reading the report. For security reasons The Mail on Sunday is not naming  the country where the meeting took place. Colonel Richard Kemp, a former member of COBRA, the Government’s emergency response  committee, said: ‘This incident underlines the need to be more careful because, with the internet, once it’s there, it is there, and it is very hard to do anything  about it. ‘Undoubtedly, anyone who is interested will have noted the report and will continue to do so. ‘I am concerned for the officer’s personal security, and I  trust that the MoD will be taking steps to ensure that this does not  happen again. There is always great sensitivity surrounding  the presence of British Special Forces anywhere in the world, and for this reason a lot of effort is made to try to conceal their identities.’ As the British campaign in Afghanistan draws to a close,  the SAS is seeking to embed  soldiers into the armies of Middle Eastern states in order to provide tactical training and gather  vital information. A regimental source said:  ‘The focus is on small teams of troops spending weeks and months with local forces, developing their skills and, while they’re there, getting to know  the ground and seeing what the Iranians are up to. ‘But these are supposed to be covert missions, not public relations exercises for local top brass. ‘If they’re too busy pushing photographs and reports of what we’re doing to the state media organisations, without thinking what the potential fall-out could be for the SAS personnel working with them, then lives are going to be put at risk.’ Middle Eastern states such as Bahrain and Saudi Arabia have recently accused Iran of aiding uprisings in their countries. The invitations from states in the region to the SAS and British intelligence to offer training  and advice is intended to thwart these attempts. An MoD spokesman said: ‘We have a long-standing policy of not commenting on the work of our Special Forces.’ A Foreign Office spokesman also declined to comment on  the matter.","SAS chief was photographed when he met high-ranking officers .

"By . Sophie Borland . PUBLISHED: . 20:24 EST, 5 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:56 EST, 6 December 2012 . Hundreds of doctors’ surgeries are too cramped and ‘not fit for purpose’, a report warns. Rooms in some are so close together that patients worry that confidential discussions can be overheard in the waiting area. Other surgeries have poor heating systems and have not bothered to install ramps or wide doors to enable easy-access for the elderly or disabled. 'Cramped': Patients in some surgeries feared their confidential discussions with their doctor could be overheard in the waiting area . A report by the Kings Fund also warned that there may be shortages of GPs in future with a high number approaching retirement age. Up to one in ten family doctors in England are over 60, although in some parts of the country it is up to a quarter. The report - which specifically looked at GP practices in London - said ‘major’ improvements were needed to cope with the higher numbers of patients. In particular it said surgeries needed to stay open for longer and ensure patients knew who to contact out-of-hours. It also advised surgeries to employ higher numbers of staff such as practice nurses and health visitors to reduce the work-load for family doctors. Anna Dixon, Director of Policy at The King’s Fund, said: ‘While there are some excellent general practices in London, the quality of care that Londoners receive is not as consistently good as it could be. ‘There is huge potential to make better use of information and data to understand and address variations in performance. ‘I hope this report will encourage GPs to engage in a discussion about how to lead a transformation in general practice to ensure all Londoners enjoy the best possible health care.’ Warning: The Kings Fund report focused on London, but there is evidence of surgeries across the country in an equally poor state . Dr Tom Coffey, Assistant Medical Director at NHS London and a GP, said: ‘The King’s Fund report recognises the excellent service offered by GPs across the capital but calls upon us to consider the transformation of primary health care in London, taking into account the changing population and varied, increasing demands.’ The study also found that a third of patients in some parts of England were unhappy about being overheard in the waiting room while they were being seen by their GP. On average 27 per cent of patients in London said they were worried about this lack of privacy but in Bromley, South London, it was as high as 34 per cent. The report said that surgeries which were too small or ‘not fit for purpose’ would not be able to provide good care. Although the study mainly focused in London, there is evidence that surgeries across England are in an equally poor state. An investigation by Pulse magazine in 2010 found that the as many as one in seven practice buildings were ‘substandard.’ And one Primary Care trust, Hammersmith and Fulham in West London, said nine of its surgeries were in such a poor state they needed to be totally rebuilt. Many trusts had cancelled refurbishments or even the installation of new central heating systems in a bid to save money. Surgeons will be ranked in a national league table in a bid to root-out incompetence. The head of the NHS, Sir Bruce Keogh, wants to publish figures on individual surgeons’ performance. The data is likely to include success rates for operations and as well as mortality rates. Last month breast surgeon Ian Paterson was suspended after it emerged he had botched up to 1,000 operations. He was also accused of operating on 450 women who were perfectly healthy at a number of hospitals across the Midlands.","Some found to have inadequate heating and insufficient easy-access facilities for elderly or disabled patients .

Argument: Sally Roberts arrives at the High Court in London for a hearing to decide whether her son Neon should have life-saving radiotherapy treatment . A 37-year-old who took her critically ill seven-year-old son into hiding today denied she was a 'bonkers mother' and said she 'only wanted the best for her son'. Sally Roberts ran away with her son Neon from Devon to Sussex because she thought cancer treatment would 'fry his brain', she told the High Court in London. She believes Neon is 'not a sick boy' and should only be given 'natural remedies' while he recovers from surgery on a brain tumour, because radiotherapy could 'damage his growth'. Her lawyer today asked the judge for sympathy, insisting that Mrs Roberts's position was 'principled, reasonable and in the best interests of Neon [her son]'. But doctors said it is 'clearly' in Neon's best . interests to have radiotherapy and chemotherapy and today argued that 'the alternative is death'. Mrs Roberts said, 'I very much apologise', as she gave evidence on the first day of the hearing to decide what treatment Neon should have. She told the judge that whatever decision the court made, 'I would still like every day to be part of my son's life. I feel I must be part of his care . It is very important for me and my son. We are very close.' She fled the house in Devon where she and Neon were staying on Monday and took him to Sussex to stop him having the life-saving radiotherapy. Fearing for Neon's survival, a judge ordered a nationwide search and allowed the boy's identity to be released to the media to help track him down. The schoolboy is currently staying with his father, Ben, while his mother argues over his treatment in court. A lawyer representing health authorities treating Neon told the court the 'alternative is death'. Mr Justice Bodey said Neon's illness was the 'stuff of every parent's nightmare' and added that he would have to balance what treatment would achieve against the 'downsides'. But doctors told that court that without it, the boy's medulloblastoma tumour may recur and he will die. Mrs Roberts said her big fear was Neon being left with a lowered IQ after the treatment. 'I want him to have the best quality of life and I fear that radiotherapy could damage and greatly affect his future,' she told the judge. 'He has an incredible sense of humour. He is a great artist. 'He has been made out that he is sick and this is not true. He is very well. He is running around. He is not a sick boy. Scroll down for video . A High Court judge made the extremely rare ruling that Neon could be named in an attempt to find him after Mr Roberts, 34, became concerned at having not heard from his wife and son in four days . 'I feel that, if you go ahead with the radiotherapy, we are depriving him of his talents. 'He is thriving . He has done so well since being in hospital.' A High Court appeal helped locate the pair in East Grinstead, West Sussex. 'I was forced into that situation,' Mrs Roberts told the court. 'That was the very worst thing I could possibly have done. 'I was given no choice. I thought if I brought him to the hospital they would not let me take him home and proceed with the treatment.' Robin Tolson QC today told Mr Justice Bodey he hoped for 'much sympathy' for Mrs Roberts' position, and pointed to evidence of risks of significantly lowered IQs in those who undergo radiotherapy and chemotherapy, as opposed to chemo alone. 'Such a significant loss of intellectual functioning is a real impairment to quality of life, particularly in the world Neon is likely to inhabit as an adult,' he said in court documents. But NHS barrister Eleanor Grey QC argued that radiotherapy has been the norm for medulloblastoma patients since the . 1950s and before that 'all patients died'. 'Alternatives such as omitting . radiotherapy and using chemotherapy only are associated with . significantly poorer survival rates,' she told the court in written . arguments. Seriously ill: Neon Roberts, pictured, has been receiving alternative therapies as he recovers from surgery to remove a brain tumour . 'If a balancing exercise assessing the . proposed treatment is conducted, on the positive side of the scales is . the fact that prompt treatment, involving radiotherapy and chemotherapy, . leads to a high chance of recovery. 'Since with no additional therapy medullablastoma will recur, the alternative is death.' Mrs Roberts claimed last night in court that a doctor told her radiotherapy would ‘fry his brains’. High Court judge Mrs Justice Hogg made . the extremely rare ruling that Neon could be named in an attempt to . find him after his father Mr Roberts, 34, became concerned at having not heard from . his wife and son in four days. Police and social workers took Neon from his mother shortly after 1.30am yesterday in East Grinstead. He was temporarily placed into foster care and then given to his father, who is separated from Neon’s mother and lives in London. But Mrs Roberts said she was out of contact because she was in Sussex taking Neon for treatment in an oxygen chamber and does not carry a mobile phone in case it affects his health. Neon’s brain tumour was reportedly removed in full during surgery on October 25 – immediately after he was diagnosed with the aggressive medulloblastoma form of cancer. Doctors then wanted to carry out the standard procedure of treating him with radiation to remove any further cancer cells and reduce the chances of the disease recurring. However, Mrs Roberts, from Brighton, East Sussex, claims that when a doctor, he referred to the procedure as ‘frying his brains’. ‘I lost all confidence in him,’ she said. ‘It was frightening and very unprofessional. I thought, they have got the whole tumour out so why are they frying his brain? ‘I fear they are going to fry my son’s brain when there are other ways we could proceed. I feel it is very unnecessary and I’m sure any mother who had researched like I have would feel the same. ‘This is my only son. He’s my world. I need to be able to tell him I did everything I could for him.’ Sally Roberts says that she fears radiotherapy will permanently harm Neon's brain, affecting his IQ . Mrs Roberts, who is originally from New Zealand, added that she fears radiotherapy will permanently damage Neon's growth and future fertility. She wants to see if the tumour returns before resorting to radiation. She said: ‘If I truly believed he had cancer now in his body I would agree to go ahead. But they are going after one cell that might be there. I am convinced it is not there because of the scans and because his spinal fluid is clear. ‘I don’t want to fry his brain and have his quality of life ruined just on the off chance there is a floating cell that is going to multiply. ‘All I’m doing is protecting my child. I’m doing what any mother would do.’ Neon has undergone a range of alternative therapies since his operation, including hours in an oxygen tank. Mrs Roberts will not allow mobile phones near Neon in case they damage his health, feeding him a diet of organic foods and juices. She is well-known in music circles and has performed as DJ Sally at venues ranging from Glastonbury Festival to Boujis Nightclub in London. Her parents, Don and Lilian Leese, who live in North Tawton, Devon, said they support their daughter’s decision. Doctors disagree with Mrs Roberts' decision to use only natural medicine and have started legal proceedings . Mrs Leese, 72, added: ‘Sally is the most caring, wonderful mother. She is totally dedicated to her children. Everything she is doing is what she believes is in Neon’s best interests. ‘She wants to work with [the doctors] but the medical profession want to do it all their way. One of the doctors scared the living daylights out of her, referring to it as “frying his brains”. 'That is something you don’t say to a mother whose child has just been diagnosed with a brain tumour.’ Mr Roberts, an IT consultant from Knightsbridge, west London, and the son of British actor Christian Roberts, described his estranged wife as a ‘concerned mother’, but added: ‘I want to make sure [Neon] has everything available to him. I understand there are lots of things that can be done to minimise the effects of radiotherapy.’ The hearing continues and the judge is expected to give his ruling tomorrow.","Mother Sally Roberts says she ran away with son Neon as she fears radiotherapy will permanently affect his IQ and damage his growth .

"By . Martin Jay In Beirut . PUBLISHED: . 13:37 EST, 23 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:04 EST, 25 March 2013 . Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati has resigned . Lebanon edged closer to a state of civil war today when President Michel Suleiman formally accepted the resignation of the prime minister, who stepped down blaming government infighting during a time of rising sectarian tensions. Prime Minister Najib Mikati submitted his . written resignation to the president after announcing he was stepping . down the day before, taking the nation by surprise. Suleiman asked that . his government assume a caretaking role while a new government is being . formed. Najib Mikati was seen by many Lebanese . as a diplomatic peace broker between the political parties, if not a . ‘sell-out’ moderate by his own Sunni group. The Harvard-educated . billionaire worked with Hezbollah and regularly came under fire to . resign from the Sunni-led opposition since October of last year, when a . security chief and nine others were killed by a car bomb in Beirut. His resignation throws Lebanon into . uncertainty, following recent weeks of numerous car bombs, . kidnappings and regular shoot outs between confessional groups, and threatens to leave a void in the state's highest ranks amid sporadic violence enflamed by the war in neighbouring Syria. The atmosphere in Beirut is tense, with four tanks being moved to the Sunni heartland in . Beirut  on Friday night just an hour before the . resignation was announced. They were later removed but few are able to talk of ‘inevitable’ war in a country once called the Switzerland of the Middle East. Many fear that . the political vacuum will be replaced with wide scale sectarian murders . as Lebanon struggles to retain, officially, its ‘neutral’ stance to . Syria’s bloodshed – a theatre of sorts which Mikati represented and . upheld to the end. Some believe his resignation was the result of pressure from US diplomats who have made it clear that the only way to secure peace for the country is to get Hezbollah out of the Lebanese government. Carnage: Mikati worked with Hezbollah and regularly came under fire to resign from the Sunni-led opposition since October of last year, when a car bomb exploded in Beirut . Lebanese Red Cross personnel are seen at the site: Cars and buildings were wrecked in the attack which left ten dead . Lebanese media speculated that his decision to step down was based on ‘insinuations’ from the US and its allies to clear the way for an anti-Hezbollah majority, but Mikati in his speech denied the allegations, stressing that it was a ‘personal choice without any intervention from anyone.’ Soha Yazbeck, a Shia office worker, . said: ‘This is a game which all the political groups have agreed to . beforehand so he can be elected again as Prime minister after the . elections. The Lebanese people expected this and resignation was his . only option to come back’. His resignation, some argue, could affirm that elections, in June, will take place. Mikati . stepping down opens the way for what is expected to be prolonged . political horse trading as parliamentary blocs try to build a majority . coalition to choose a new prime minister. Mikati . added after his meeting with Lebanon's president: ‘I hope that this . resignation will provide an opening in the existing deadlock and pave . the way for a (political) solution.' Pressure: Some believe Mikati's resignation was the result of pressure from US diplomats who want Hezbollah (Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah pictured) out of the Lebanese government . Mikati . has been prime minister since June 2011, heading a government dominated . by the Shiite militant group Hezbollah and its allies, many of whom . have a close relationship with Syria. This has sparked clashes in Lebanon as many believe that Hezbollah provides the Assad regime with . fighters who move across the border and fight Lebanese Sunnis who side with the rebels there. The government's . main rivals is a western-backed coalition headed by former Prime . Minister Saad al-Hariri, son of Rafik Hariri, who was also Prime . Minister and was killed in a truck bombing in 2005. The 57-year-old's resignation came against a backdrop of his continued battle with Hezbollah as he failed to convince the Shia militant group to keep a Sunni security chief in office and create an electoral body to oversee parliamentary elections in June. He stepped down on Friday in protest of the parliament's inability to agree on a law to govern elections set for later this year, as well as the refusal by Hezbollah and its allies in the cabinet to extend the tenure of the country's police chief, Maj. Gen. Ashraf Rifi, who at 58 is about to hit the mandatory retirement age for his rank. Rival: The government's main opposition is a western-backed coalition headed by former Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri . Rifi, like Mikati, is a Sunni Muslim who is considered a foe by Hezbollah. In his speech Friday, Mikati said that if Rifi is not allowed to stay on, his departure would send the police department into ‘a vacuum.’ Underpinning the political crisis are Lebanon’s sectarian politics and the fact that the country's two largest political blocs support opposite sides in Syria's civil war. Lebanon and Syria share a complex network of political and sectarian ties, and many fear that violence in Syria will soon spread to Lebanon. Clash: Gunmen who support and oppose Bashar Assad (pictured) clashed in Tripoli on Friday . There were signs of rising tensions before the resignation. Gunmen who support and oppose Syrian President Bashar Assad clashed Friday in the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli, leaving six people dead and more than 20 wounded, according to the state-run National News Agency. Clashes between the Sunni neighborhood of Bab Tabbaneh, which supports Syria's rebels, and the adjacent Alawite neighborhood of Jabal Mohsen, which supports Assad, have broken out repeatedly in recent months. Assad is Alawite, a Shiite offshoot sect. Also in Tripoli, the Lebanese army said a soldier was killed and several others wounded during an army raid to capture several gunmen. Former Prime Minister Fouad Siniora, a close political ally of former Sunni PM, Saad Hariri who has frequently called for Mikati to step down, said his resignation ‘opens the possibility of fresh dialogue’ between Lebanon's political camps. Public opinion today in Beirut was varied. Elie, 41, unemployed argued that ‘some sort of dialogue should start between [the two main political coalitions] otherwise, clashes will intensify up North and spread and no one will be able to stop it sliding into civil war’. Elie, who didn’t wish to be identified, added that Mikati’s resignation ‘will be seen as a significant victory for Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the US who want Hezbollah out of office’.","Unexpected resignation throws country into uncertainty at a critical time .

Concerned: Care services minister Norman Lamb says there needs to be 'complete culture change' Care institutions where vulnerable patients are dumped for years on end will be shut down in the wake of the Winterbourne View scandal. Ministers want to end the practice of sending adults and children with learning disabilities to private hospitals and care homes that are often hundreds of miles from where they used to live. Instead, they want them to be looked after in their own homes or smaller residential centres nearby. The plans have been drawn up in the wake of the abuse of residents at Winterbourne View, a private hospital for adults with learning difficulties near Bristol. Last year a BBC Panorama documentary exposed how staff routinely tortured and abused vulnerable patients. The facility has since been closed and six staff jailed. Although the Government does not think abuse on this scale is widespread, there is concern that hundreds of patients are being poorly looked after in similar institutions. Many are sedated with high-dose drugs or forcefully held down if they become upset and aggressive. There are currently 1,200 adults and children with learning disabilities placed in what are known as assessment and treatment centres. But over the next two years the Government wants to reduce the number of patients to between 300 and 400, and to ensure that they only stay for a few weeks at a time. Instead, ministers want local councils and NHS bodies to enable patients to be looked after in their own homes or to be  housed in small, local, centres. Care services minister Norman Lamb said: ‘There has to be a complete culture change. Would we tolerate someone with cancer getting the wrong sort of treatment or wrong sort of care? ‘No, we wouldn’t, and yet for too long we have tolerated people with learning disabilities being put in the wrong settings. Scandal: A BBC Panorama documentary last year exposed abuse at Winterbourne View private hospital in Bristol . Abuse: The investigation exposed how vulnerable patients suffered terrible treatment . ‘They are living in large hospitals, completely inappropriately, where they are put under stress and strain, where their behaviour is inevitably affected.’ Many of these hospitals are privately owned and ministers fear they may be ‘profiting from others’ misery’. They want the owners and boards of directors at these firms to face prosecution if the hospital is found to be abusing or neglecting patients. Mr Lamb added: ‘When you look at Winterbourne View, the people who committed the abuse and the assaults were convicted, but what about the people making the money from that company?’ The Government has also instructed the Care Quality Commission watchdog to carry out unannounced inspections of these hospitals next year. Those found to be failing will be closed down and staff will face prosecution. And in June 2014, NHS organisations and councils will have to have drawn up a care-plan for each patient based on their needs. In most cases these will state they should be looked after in their own home or local residential centre. Organisations will have to provide a ‘justification’ whenever people continue to be housed in a hospital.","Ministers want more people with learning disabilities to be treated at home rather than private hospitals and care homes .

Distress: Women who suffer miscarriages are often dealt with by 'insensitive' doctors, nurses and receptionists, according to a new report . Women who suffer miscarriages are being treated in a heartless ‘conveyor belt’ system, according to the NHS watchdog. Its report says patients who have lost their baby are often dealt with by ‘insensitive’ doctors, nurses and receptionists. Many are left to wait on wards where they can hear others giving birth, according to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Setting out new guidelines, the watchdog is demanding that staff be retrained to show ‘dignity and respect’. Nice says that staff must be aware of the ‘significant distress’ women go through during and after a miscarriage. Its report also suggests new measures to stop healthy babies being aborted. In some cases foetuses are needlessly terminated after doctors are unable to detect a heartbeat. Doctors are being told to carry out a second scan a week to a fortnight later to be sure a foetus is no longer alive. There are also new guidelines  to treat ectopic pregnancies, in which an embryo implants itself in the fallopian tube instead of the womb. The condition occurs in one in 100 pregnancies and can eventually threaten the mother’s life. The foetus rarely survives. Doctors may confuse the symptoms of ectopic pregnancies with bladder infections or appendicitis. Nice is urging GPs to offer pregnancy tests in routine appointments to ensure the condition is picked up earlier. The watchdog also wants hospitals to run specialised ‘pregnancy assessment services’ at evenings and weekends as well as in the week, so that women have easy access to the best care. Care: Nice wants hospitals to run more 'pregnancy assessment services'. Around one in five pregnancies end in miscarriage . Around one in five pregnancies end in miscarriage. Some 168,000 women go through the ordeal each year in England. The chairman of the Birth Trauma Association, Julie Orford, who advised Nice, described how doctors gave her a ‘cup of tea and a leaflet’ after saying she had lost the baby. ‘It felt very much like a conveyor belt and I found it insensitive to be put in a waiting room full of people when we had been given such bad news,’ she said. ‘It was summer and the windows were open so I could hear ladies who were in labour on the maternity ward downstairs. 'This made it more upsetting because I knew I was in the process of losing my baby. Emotionally, I was devastated. I felt numb, shocked and emotionally drained. ‘Nobody spoke to you in a sensitive manner and I guess when there is a shortage of beds they are just trying to get you in and out.’ Gynaecology specialist Professor Mary Ann Lumsden of Glasgow University, who chaired the Nice panel, said: ‘We try to teach junior doctors that it doesn’t cost a great deal to be sympathetic.’ Health Minister Dr Dan Poulter said: ‘Pregnant women deserve the best care possible. Many hospitals offer it, but provision can sometimes show unacceptable variations throughout our NHS.’","A report by Nice says that patients who have lost their baby are often dealt with by 'insensitive' doctors, nurses and receptionists .

Victim: Della Callagher, 46, started to feel ill on the evening of Christmas Day after the meal at the Railway Hotel in Hornchurch, Essex. She died two days later . A woman who died from food poisoning two days after eating a pub Christmas Day lunch had been sent home from hospital and told to lie down. Della Callagher, 46, was one of 30 diners to fall ill after eating a £39.95 four-course meal at the Railway Hotel in Hornchurch, Essex. But while the others started to recover, her condition deteriorated and on Boxing Day her husband John took her to the nearest  accident and emergency unit. Despite the fact she was obviously very unwell, Mr Callagher claims that doctors merely gave her an anti-sickness injection and told her to ‘go home and lie down’. Her condition worsened, and that evening he called an ambulance fearing she barely had a pulse. She died the following day at Queen’s Hospital in Romford, less than 24 hours after being sent home by doctors in the casualty unit. Mr Callagher, 51, chief executive of a recruitment firm, said the hospital had ‘turned my wife away’ rather than trying to save her life. ‘They sent her home and she just lay in my arms, basically she was dying. We called an ambulance and went back to the hospital but she barely had a pulse. It was disgusting the way she was dealt with.’ Last autumn the hospital’s A&E unit was heavily criticised by the official watchdog which warned that at times the standards of care were ‘collapsing’. Suspected: Della Callagher was one of 30 diners to fall ill after eating a four-course meal at the Railway Hotel in Homechurch, Essex . The Care Quality Commission also found half of patients were having to wait more than an hour to be seen by a doctor or nurse. Speaking from his home in Hornchurch, . Mr Callagher said: ‘If she was rolling around on the floor they would . have admitted her – but because she was dignified she wasn’t. ‘Della was so fit and healthy, I . can’t believe it. This is devastating.We were about to celebrate our . 25th wedding anniversary.’ Mr Callagher, who has a 14-year-old . daughter, said he planned to sue Barking, Havering and Redbridge Trust, . which runs Queen’s Hospital, and the Railway Hotel where they had the . meal. Officials from the Health Protection . Agency have since confirmed that Mrs Callagher, whose funeral will take . place today, had contracted Clostridium perfringens, a common form of . food poisoning that strikes around 90,000 Britons a year. Investigation: The Health Protection Authority has launched an investigation with Havering Council to establish whether there are links between the outbreak of food poisoning and food eaten at the Railway Hotel . It is not usually fatal and only one . in around 10,000 victims die – mainly the elderly, babies or those with . an underlying illness. Symptoms include stomach cramps and diarrhoea which usually resolve themselves without treatment within 24 hours. It is caused by eating turkey, chicken or red meat that has been contaminated by Clostridium perfringens bacteria. If food is left outside a fridge for a . long period of time the bacteria multiply. It is not clear whether this . outbreak was caused by infected turkey or cold meat starters that had . been served beforehand. Treatment: Mrs Callagher was initially seen at Queen's Hospital in Romford, pictured . One guest at the pub who was among the 30 to have been struck down said he had ‘never felt so ill in his life.’ John Rowe, who lives in Hornchurch . said: ‘It ruined my Christmas and New Year, but luckily I survived it. I’m very sad to hear that a lady has died.’ A spokesman for Ember Inns, which . runs the Railway Tavern said: ‘The local authority is investigating an . alleged food poisoning outbreak at the Railway. ‘We are fully co-operating. Until the investigation is complete we can’t speculate about a possible cause or source.’ The hospital has apologised to the family although it insisted its staff gave ‘appropriate’ treatment. Dr Mike Gill, medical director of the trust, promised to ‘fully review’ the case. The trust is currently facing severe financial difficulties having amassed debts of £50million. The bacterium Clostridium perfringens is widely distributed in the environment and food. It is the third most common cause of food poisoning in the UK. If spores of the bacteria survive cooking, they can germinate to form growing cells. Spores cannot grow in a refrigerator or freezer but thrive at room temperature. In optimal growing conditions, the organism has a generation time of 10 to 12 minutes. When a large number of the vegetative cells are consumed this will more-likely-than-not lead to gastroenteritis. Nasty: The bacterium Clostridium perfringens is widely distributed in the environment and food . Food poisoning from the bacteria most often occurs when foodstuffs, usually red meat or poultry, is prepared in advance and kept warm for several hours before serving. The illness, with diarrhoea and abdominal pain the main symptoms, generally lasts for less than 24 hours but elderly people may be more seriously affected. The bacteria is also responsible for 80-95 per cent of gas gangrene cases, a rare but severe form of gangrene.","Della Callagher, 46, fell ill hours after Christmas dinner .

The report warns the CQC is not carrying out enough inspections to ensure patients are not at risk . The health watchdog has lost the confidence of the public after missing some of the worst scandals in hospitals and care homes, according to MPs. The Care Quality Commission is not carrying out enough adequate inspections to ensure patients are not at risk, they said. In a scathing report, MPs from the health select committee warn that ‘patients, relatives and the public do not have confidence in the CQC’s standards or the outcomes of its inspections’. The watchdog had declared that the maternity unit at the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay trust in Cumbria, where up to seven babies died, was providing ‘safe’ and ‘high-quality’ care. The CQC also failed to act after being contacted by a whistleblower at Winterbourne View care home, in Bristol, where staff were torturing adults with learning difficulties. It inspected the home only after a BBC Panorama investigation. The CQC is responsible for 30,000 care homes, hospitals and GP practices. Last February its chief executive, Cynthia Bower, was forced to resign, albeit with a £1.4million pension pot. It has since promised to overhaul the way it is run. Inspectors visited the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay trust in Cumbria in 2010 and claimed that it was meeting all ‘essential standards’. But the maternity unit is now the centre of a police investigation over the deaths of seven babies and two mothers since 2008 and a coroner has warned that midwives may have ‘colluded’ to alter medical records and cover up their mistakes. And the Winterbourne View care home in Bristol has since been closed down and six workers have been jailed for neglect and abuse. The report says the watchdog needs to ‘raise the bar’ when inspecting care homes. Often the CQC inspects a home and concludes it is safe - even though patients and relatives are concerned the care is poor. The CQC failed to act after being contacted by a whistleblower at Winterbourne View care home, in Bristol, and only inspected the home after a BBC Panorama investigation, the report says . The watchdog has been repeatedly criticised over the last two years amid concerns it is not protecting the public. Tory MP Stephen Dorrell, chair of the committee said: ‘The CQC’s primary focus should be to ensure that the public has confidence that its inspections provide an assurance of acceptable standards in care and patient safety. ‘We do not believe that the CQC has yet succeeded in this objective. ‘The CQC needs to ensure that its inspections represent a challenging process which is designed to find service shortcomings where they exist, ensure, when appropriate that service providers address them rapidly, and report promptly both to providers and users of the service. The public has lost confidence in the watchdog after it missed some of the worst scandals in hospitals and care homes, says the report . ‘The CQC also needs to show that it treats feedback from the public as free intelligence and that it acts swiftly when serious complaints are brought to light this way.’ David Behan, the CQC’s new chief executive said: ‘In our strategic review we consulted widely on a clear statement of our purpose and role. ‘We also set out our intentions to improve how we communicate with the public, make better use of information, and work more effectively as an organisation and with others, including those who provide care. ‘We have already begun to make some of these changes and will continue this process next year.’","MPs criticise Care Quality Commission in scathing report .

"By . Sophie Borland . PUBLISHED: . 20:41 EST, 2 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:42 EST, 3 January 2013 . GPs are to be offered ‘bribes’ of around £7,500 to slash the number of patients they send to accident and emergency. Under a controversial bonus scheme that will hit the elderly particularly hard, they will be urged not to refer those with pneumonia, severe influenza or heart problems to hospital. Patients and senior GPs have labelled the scheme a ‘perverse incentive’ and an ‘unethical waste of taxpayers’ money’. Doctors will be offered financial incentives to reduce 'avoidable' admissions to A&E . Laurence Buckman, chairman of the British Medical Association’s GPs’ committee, said: ‘I don’t want  a single patient walking into my surgery and saying my grandma’s dead because you refused to admit her. So we’re not going to admit people with pneumonia? I think most doctors will be horrified by this.’ The scheme will be brought in across England this year by the NHS Commissioning Board, which has been created to oversee GP services. As part of Government health reforms, family doctors are in the process of setting up local clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) to replace primary care trusts. Each group will be set targets to improve patients’ health and the overall quality of GP services. If these are met surgeries will be paid bonuses of £5 for every patient on their books, which works out at £30,000 for an average GP practice. But it has emerged that a quarter of this extra money – an average of £7,500 – will be based on GPs reducing ‘avoidable’ admissions to A&E. Dr Laurence Buckman, chairman of the British Medical Association's GPs' committee, labelled the scheme 'an unethical waste of taxpayer's money' From April, GPs will be monitored for the numbers of patients they refer with pneumonia, severe flu, urinary infections and heart failure – which largely affect older people. The NHS claims that many such admissions are avoidable because patients could be looked after at home, or better cared for early on so they don’t become so unwell in the first place. GPs will be paid the money if they reduce these admissions or ensure they don’t increase. They can then decide whether to plough it back into patient care  or pay themselves and their staff  a bonus. But Dr Buckman said: ‘This is an inappropriate, unethical waste of taxpayers’ money. Patients might suspect that I was doing things to them in order that I would get money. I don’t want to be paid because someone was admitted or not admitted, I want to be paid because I did my job.‘I wouldn’t dream of participating in such a scheme.’ He said refusing to admit patients went completely against the Hippocratic Oath, which obliges doctors to carry out their duties ethically and responsibly. Dr Beth McCarron-Nash, a GP based near Padstow, Cornwall, said: ‘It’s a perverse incentive. I do not believe doctors should be given financial incentives not to refer or treat. A GP puts the person sitting in front of them as the priority. If they need to be referred, they are referred.’ NHS officials believe GPs should improve the care of the elderly and other patients with long-term conditions such as heart failure so they do not need to go to hospital. But GPs point out that if patients develop pneumonia or suffer a severe angina attack they have no choice but to refer them. Over the past six years, GPs’ salaries have soared to £110,000 on average, even though they no longer have to work evenings and weekends.","GPs to be paid not to refer patients to A&E in bid to reduce admissions .
