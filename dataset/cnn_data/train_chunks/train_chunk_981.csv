"Sergio Aguero produced a magnificent performance, scoring four times as Manchester City demolished a 10-man Tottenham 4-1.The 26-year-old could even have scored more, but missed a first-half penalty. Here, Sportsmail's Ian Ladyman gives you his verdict on how the players performed in Saturday's early Premier League kick-off at the Etihad. MANCHESTER CITY . JOE HART 9 . Aguero will get the headlines for his hat-trick but the England goalkeeper was exceptional and made two or three crucial saves. BACARY SAGNA 6 . The former Arsenal full-back didn’t manage to get forward as much as he would like and had his hands full with Christian Eriksen. VINCENT KOMPANY 7 . Not quite at his inspirational best at the moment but City are still a better side when he is in it. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Sergio Aguero could have scored a first-half hat-trick but missed his second penalty and the rebound . MARTIN DEMICHELIS 6 . Much better so far this campaign than in his debut season, but was off the pace at times here. Got himself in a right mix-up to concede a second-half penalty, even if contact was made outside the box. GAEL CLICHY 6.5 . Did better down his side than Sagna did down, linking up well with James Milner to trouble Eric Dier. JAMES MILNER 7.5 . Increasingly one of the stars of City’s season, Milner is worth his place at the moment. Terrific again here. Frank lampard began the game brightly, and won his team's first penalty, but soon had to go off injured . FERNANDO 6 . Didn’t really control the centre of the pitch as much as Manuel Pellegrini would have liked. Lost the ball clumsily for Tottenham’s goal. FRANK LAMPARD 8 . Only lasted half an hour but was exceptional, playing a part in City’s first two goals. JESUS NAVAS 6.5 . Needs a run of games to really find his best form but was sporadically dangerous on Saturday. His first thought is always a positive one. David Silva is brought down by Tottenham's Younes Kaboul for Manchester City's second penalty . DAVID SILVA 7.5 . Playing just behind a centre forward suits the Spaniard, allowing him to find pockets of space. Spurs never controlled him. SERGIO AGUERO 9.5 . What more can we say about this guy? Full of confidence and rightly so. Would have been perfect apart from the penalty miss. SUBS: Fernandinho (Lampard 27) 6, Jovetic (Silva 69) 6, Toure (Fernando 77) 6. Summer signing Fernando battles with the impressive Nacer Chadli during the first half at The Etihad . TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR . HUGO LLORIS 8 . Not much the Frenchman could do  really. Made a penalty save and several other good stops but still conceded four. ERIC DIER 6.5 . One of Tottenham’s better defenders, still found it hard to cope with the threat of Milner and Clichy. YOUNES KABOUL 5.5 . The team’s captain but he didn’t really play like it. Spent too much of his time diving in early in dangerous situations. French keeper Hugo Lloris makes a save from Ciy striker Aguero during a busy first half . FEDERICO FAZIO 6 . Sent off in the second half for a tug on Aguero, he must have been feeling dizzy by then. Never coped with Aguero and City’s runners. DANNY ROSE 6 . Looked uncomfortable whenever Navas stood up to him. A long afternoon for the full-back. ETIENNE CAPOUE 6 . Told to do an enforcing job in the centre. He did to an extent and managed to disrupt some of City’s rhythm. Faded in the second half though. RYAN MASON 6 . Another Spurs player who had a long afternoon. Again was sporadically effective but couldn’t maintain it. Within minutes of City's opener Tottenham grabbed an equaliser courtesy of Christian Eriksen . ERIK LAMELA 5 . A day to forget for the Spurs midfielder. Lost the ball in the build-up for City’s first goal and things only got worse. CHRISTIAN ERIKSEN 7.5 . Tottenham’s best outfield player, Eriksen troubled City throughout. Needs to make slightly better decisions with his final pass at times. Erik Lamela (right) put in another poor display for Tottenham at the Etihad . NACER CHADLI 7 . Looks to be a stayer for Tottenham. Neat and tidy and possesses a killer final pass. ROBERTO SOLDADO 6 . Looked low on confidence, as his penalty miss showed. Was unlucky shortly after that when Hart denied him with his legs. SUBS: Dembele (Capoue 59) 6, Townsend (Lamela 59) 6,  Vertonghen (Mason 69) 6.","Manchester city beat Tottenham 4-1 in their Premier League clash .

"Click HERE to view the stats from the frenetic game using our fantastic match zone service . The works of Mozart might reduce a man to tears; Sergio Aguero, likewise. It was the Tottenham manager Maurico Pochettino who made the comparison between the two men in the run up to this match, attempting to convey something of the Argentine’s special talent. Perhaps he might wish to temper his praise in future, for Aguero played like a man inspired by the compliment. He was sublime and Pochettino, if not quite weeping by the end, would at least have been overwhelmed with emotion: frustration, mainly.

In a game of four penalties – only two of them awarded correctly - Aguero scored four goals, might have had seven were it not for Hugo Lloris and dominated a game in which City chose to rest key men for their crucial Champions League clash in Moscow on Tuesday. Not content with that list of achievements, he also surpassed Carlos Tevez as City’s all time Premier League scorer. And yet Pochettino’s despair was legitimate given that Tottenham played well, were the victim of some poor decisions, and had the opportunity to bring the the game back to 2-2 on 61 minutes when Roberto Soldado missed a penalty. Well though Soldado played up to that point, you fear that might represent the point of no return for his confidence as a Premier League player. Instead of pushing City to the bitter end, Tottenham added yet another excruciating result to their recent run against Manchester City: 0-6, 1-5 and 1-4 runs the sequence since last November. ‘It was amusing game for the fans,’ said Manuel Pellegrini, in his precise but idiosyncratic English. ‘It was 4-1 but it could have been 7-3. It’s very important to be an attractive team but maybe it’s important also not to make as many mistakes, especially with excessive trust, with the ball at our feet.’ Indeed, were you inclined to picky, the laxity of City’s holding midfielders once Frank Lampard had gone off injured would be a major point of concern. Still, the brilliance of Aguero made it hard to dwell on negatives. ‘He is one of three of four best strikers in the world,’ dead panned Pellegrini, as excited as an accountant announcing mediocre end-of-year results. ‘I’m not just saying it after this game: It was not easy for him last year when he had so many injuries to produce these kind of performances when he’s not 100 per cent fit. Now he demonstrates how he can play. Maybe he won’t score four goals a game but he will demonstrate why everyone says he is one of the best players in the world.’ For Pochettino there were only regrets. ‘It’s tough to accept the result, because the performance was good,’ he said. The persistence and determination of Lee Mason and the guile of Christian Eriksen gave them a real opportunity to obtain points from this game; yet the rash decisions of Younes Kaboul and Federico Fazio would cost them.

Tottenham should have taken the lead on eight minutes, Soldado playing in Mason, who should have scored from close range but was denied by Joe Hart. You suspected Tottenham would suffer for that and on twelve minutes Lamela lost the ball to Sagna who found Aguero in tight space in the penalty area. Kaboul thought he had him covered, but there is no real containing the Argentina. He simply jinxed away to create space and shoot beyond Lloris. Yet Tottenham had legitimate cause for complaint, Lampard, preferred to the rested Yaya Toure, jumping over the ball in an offside position as it headed goal-wards. No matter, for within a minute Spurs were level. Fernando lost the ball to the superb Mason, Soldado picking up the scraps and feeding Eriksen, who fired in off the cross bar. But they weren’t level for long. On 19 minutes Lamela attempted a clumsy but innocuous challenge on Lampard, who fell to ground in the manner of a seasoned professional and a penalty was awarded. It was barely a penalty but Aguero simply stroked the ball past Lloris. The game threatened to run away from Spurs for the first time on 32 minutes. This time it was Kaboul committing a rash challenge on David Silva in the area and this time the penalty was legitimate. But this time Aguero proved fallible, allowing Lloris to save with his legs. Even then, such is his ability, Aguero almost scored anyway, leaping in the air to volley the impossibly-high rebound over. A Lloris versus Aguero side show was developing – the Frenchman produced excellent saves on 24 minutes and 49 minutes – but Tottenham stayed in the contest. Eriksen’s strike on 40 minutes tested Hart and the Dane set up Mason on 41 minutes, whose strike required excellent reactions from Hart. Frank Lampard was accused of diving after going down easily under the challenge of Erik Lamela for the first penalty . Younes Kaboul gave away the second penalty of the afternoon after a late slide on Spanish midfielder David Silva . Frank Lampard was taken off on a stretcher midway through the first half at the Etihad Stadium . It seemed to be a thigh strain for Lampard, but it is unclear how serious the injury was . Lampard seemed to injure himself under the challenge of Ryan Mason, though there was not much contact . It was on 61 minutes that Hart came into his own. Soldado spun his marker Martin Demichelis, and was clipped, crucially, outside the penalty area. Regardless referee Jonathon Moss awarded the spot kick. Soldado took the kick, lamely, and Hart, diving splendidly to his right, stretched out a hand to save. Hart again was on hand to parry away a Soldado volley on 64 minutes, a key moment for Pochettino. However, Tottenham do have that innate capacity to self-destruct. Federico Fazio had performed competently on his Premier League debut until the 66th minute when the sight of Aguero rushing away on to a Navas cross proved too much and he and hauled the Argentine back, unnecessarily, as there was still plenty required of the Argentine to score. A red card, a fourth penalty and a hat-trick for Aguero ensued. The contest ended there. Aguero added the fourth, simply finding space from a deep free kick, this time at the expense of Jan Vertonghen, and shooting low past Lloris on 75 minutes.

"A drunk South African army officer laid siege to a police station where his men where being held after being caught in an illegal drinking den, it has been claimed. The senior officer is alleged to have flown into a drunken rage when he learned his men had been arrested in the town of Oudtshoorn, near the country's south coast. A complaint against him says he charged down to the local police station and surrounded it with 120 soldiers and two armoured personnel carriers to demand the men's release. A South African army armoured personnel carrier, of the kind allegedly used by an unnamed general to lay siege to a police station where his men were held after they were arrested in an illegal drinking den . The arrested soldiers - alleged to include at least one other officer - had been found by police at an illegal drinking den, where they were celebrating a change of command at the training base. According to an official complaint filed by South Africa's military union, the senior officer - whom it did not name - mobilised his troops when he heard of his men's fate. 'A certain Army general who, whilst allegedly intoxicated, unlawfully mobilised armed soldiers and armoured infantry fighting vehicles in order to free a senior ranking officer and several other soldiers', it said. According to local media, the troops surrounded Oudtshoorn's Bongolethu police station. The police locked their station door and armed themselves.

'We demand that the South African National Defence Force immediately suspends the [officer] involved and investigate charges of intimidation and sedition against him. 'Clearly his conduct displays utter abuse of rank and the belief that he is above the law. 'In addition, his conduct illustrates that he cannot be trusted in a position of military authority and that he is irresponsible and dangerous, being in command of military personnel and equipment.' A spokesman for South Africa's police confirmed only that 31 people were arrested at an unlicensed bar in Oudtshoorn on Friday.

"Oscar Pistorius' father has been accused of racism by South Africa's governing ANC after he appeared to blame high levels of violent crime against whites on the party. Seeking to explain why his murder accused son kept at least one handgun - and had applied to own six more - Henke Pistorius said 'you can't rely on the police'. 'It speaks to the ANC government, look at white crime levels, why protection is so poor in this country, it's an aspect of our society', he told the Daily Telegraph. Strong words: Oscar Pistorius's father Henke, right, has blamed South Africa's ANC government for failing to tackle crime against white people . Distance: The Olympic athlete's uncle Arnold: 'Oscar and the rest of the Pistorius family distances itself from the comments' The comments, made on Sunday to the Telegraph's Southern Africa correspondent Aislinn Laing, have prompted official fury. Jackson Mthembu, spokesman for the . governing African National Congress, said it 'rejects with contempt' the . claim that the government was not willing to protect white people. 'Not only is this statement devoid of . truth, it is also racist', Mr Mthembu said. 'It is sad that he has . chosen to politicise a tragic incident that is still fresh in the minds . of those affected and the public.' Oscar Pistorius, 26, has been charged . with premeditated murder of his model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, 29, . after he shot her three times while she cowered in his bathroom. The star athlete claims he killed her . by accident and ever since he was granted bail, his team of PR . representatives have worked hard to present him as a grieving victim of . circumstance. The case has already starting to . divide opinion in South Africa. However, until Henke Pistorius' comments, race played no issue. Both Pistorius and Miss Steenkamp are . white. No doubt aware of the negative impact . Henke Pistorius' comments may have, Oscar Pistorius' PR team yesterday . rushed to distance the athlete from the growing row. Pistorius is charged with the premeditated killing of his girlfriend - he fired four shots through a locked toilet door at his home in South Africa, but said he believed he was shooting a burglar . 'Oscar Pistorius’ family is deeply concerned about the comments made by Oscar’s father', the family statement's read. It went on: 'The comments doesn’t represent the views of Oscar or the rest of the Pistorius family' 'We are acutely aware of the fact that . we are only at the beginning of a long road to prove that what happened . to Reeva Steenkamp was a terrible accident and that Oscar  never . intended to harm her, let alone cause her death. Henke Pistorius, Oscar's . grandfather Hendrik, and his paternal uncles Arnold, Theo and Leo have . been reported to own a combined total of 55 shotguns and handguns. Despite this, Henke Pistorius said, . he, his fathers and brothers 'have been brought up in a way that we . value the lives of others very highly.' Contrary to Henke Pistorius' claim . that whites are disproportionately impacted by South Africa's high . levels of violent crime it is the country's black population that is . bears the brunt of the problem, official statistics show. Pistorius is charged with the . premeditated killing of his girlfriend - he fired four shots . through a locked toilet door at his home in South Africa, but said he . believed he was shooting a burglar. He is next due to appear at Pretoria Magistrates Court in June . ahead of an eventual trial expected later this year.

Pistorius . bragged to him that on the previous night he had heard a noise, reached . for the handgun under his bed and gone downstairs ready to confront an . intruder before realising it was a false alarm. He then showed Sokolove the gun in a wooden box ‘almost like a jewellery case’. Sokolove said: ‘Oscar liked this 9mm semi-automatic very much. The gun was important to him.

"Killed: Mido Macia, pictured with his sister Melida, was arrested on Tuesday evening in the Daveyton township and dragged to his death. The police officers have been charged with murder . Eight police officers accused of handcuffing taxi driver Mido Macia to their patrol car and dragging him along the street until he died have been arrested on murder charges.

"Proud moment: Reeva Steenkamp poses with her friend Angus Hayes on her graduation day at Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University in 2005 . The girlfriend of Blade Runner Oscar Pistorius was due to make a heartfelt Valentine's Day speech to schoolchildren just hours after she was gunned down at the Paralympian's home. FHM cover girl Reeva Steenkamp, 29, was expected to tell pupils that she had previously been in an abusive relationship. She was due to reveal that it had been this relationship - and the resultant 'loss of self worth' - which prompted her to move to Johannesburg to rebuild her life. But the law graduate never made it to the school. Instead, she was found riddled with bullets at Pistorius's luxury home after allegedly being shot dead by the double amputee in the early hours of that morning. In a somewhat cryptic message, she was due to warn the secondary school pupils in Johannesburg: 'No matter how many people say that they ""love"" you, if you do not love your person then you will never step outside of the physical you. 'The physical you can only do so much if your mental you is lost inside of all the confusion.' In her notes for the speech, which can be seen in full below, she said it 'took some serious soul searching to remind myself of my value in this world.' She said she enjoyed a 'blessed and privileged' upbringing on a small farm outside Cape Town, but later met a man who was abusive, which she suggests was caused because his 'mother was abusive to him'. However, she does not reveal any further details. She intended to finish her talk by telling them: 'Go home and tell your parents, siblings, neighbours that they are appreciated. 'You will go to bed with a happy heart and open mind for the future.' The speech was set to take place the day after she excitedly tweeted about her own plans for Valentine's Day. The model asked her followers on Twitter: ‘What do you have up your sleeve for your love tomorrow??? #getexcited.’ She added: 'It should be a day of love for everyone. May it be blessed!' Scroll down for her speech notes in full . Tragic twist: Miss Steenkamp was due to make a heartfelt Valentine's Day speech to schoolchildren just hours after she was gunned down at boyfriend Oscar Pistorius's luxury home . Diverse career: Having graduated with a law degree, Miss Steenkamp went on to become an FHM cover girl . Earlier today, Pistorius broke down in tears in court as he was formally charged with Miss Steenkamp's murder. The star held his head in his hands as one count of murder was read out to him in Pretoria Magistrates' Court. He did not enter a plea, but his family and management company later said he disputed the allegation 'in the strongest terms'. According to media reports in South Africa this morning, security guards at the complex found Pistorius by Steenkamp's body in the bathroom after she had been shot four times through the door. It came as a new picture emerged of the Miss Steenkamp beaming with pride after graduating with a law degree in 2005 from Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University. She is pictured in robes with Angus Hayes, one of her friends who also graduated from the Faculty of Law that year. Gunned down: Miss Steenkamp was allegedly shot four times by Pistorius (right) at his Pretoria home . Happy: Reeva went on Twitter the day before she was killed to say how excited she was about Valentine's Day . He described her today as 'genuine with a loving nature'. 'You were always kind and gentle and perfectly mannered, a true lady without question,' he said. 'I . never met your father Barry, of whom you spoke with so much affection . and pride, but I am fortunate enough to know your dear mom June and I . can only thank her for her gift to the world. 'She gave you such strength and love that you never ran out of energy to shine for us. 'Thank you for everything you did for me and for all the lessons.' He added: 'You were so busy after university fretting about becoming a success that you never stopped to see that that you already are one. 'Forget riches and post-grads and titles. What better mark of success can there be than to add as much love to the world as you did? You were so special. 'My dear Reeva, you lived your life as you appeared to the world. 'You lived it beautifully. Our memories of you, this invisible light that you always gave to us so selflessly, will help us navigate our lives forever.' Too much to bear: Blade Runner Oscar Pistorius weeps in the dock as he is formally charged with the murder of his model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp at Pretoria Magistrates' Court . Worldwide attention: The hearing came after a two-hour delay while Oscar Pistorius's lawyers objected to the scrum of reporters that packed into the courtroom . Miss Steenkamp was about to embark on . the next stage of her dynamic and varied career, this time as a TV star, . when she was killed. Born . in Cape Town on August 19, 1983, she later moved to Port Elizabeth as a . child where she grew up with her mother June and father Barry, a . racehorse trainer. After graduating, she made a dynamic career change after being scouted and named the first face of cosmetics giant Avon South Africa. She became a keen horse rider but broke her back in an horrific fall six years ago, suffering injuries so severe that she had to learn to walk again. Her rehabilitation may have brought her into Pistorius's path, and friends said she had admired his single-minded determination to race. She moved to Johannesburg six years ago and since then has travelled between the city and Cape Town to film and shoot some of South Africa's leading campaigns and commercials. Toyota, FHM, Clover and Italian brand Zui are some of the more prestigious clients she has worked for. Speaking in an interview in 2012, she said: 'At the end of last year I made an application to the Bar. 'It was a nerve-wracking experience. As I walked out I got the call for the FHM shoot as well as two others. I made a decision to take the modelling shoots. I believe in destiny and faith.' This weekend, Steenkamp was set to star in South African reality television series Tropika Island Of Treasure, in which celebrities and ordinary people compete in remote, exotic locations in a variety of daily challenges. Below are the rough notes Miss Steenkamp made for the speech at Sandown High School, a co-educational government school in Johannesburg. They are reproduced exactly as she wrote them. 'PE' stands for Port Elizabeth, the town on South Africa's south coast where Miss Steenkamp grew up, while 'Jozi' is South Africa's commercial capital Johannesburg.Who received flowers/chocolates/cards/messages/tweets/etc today (February 14) for Valentine's Day? Tell them what I received, make a small joke about this. And then tell them that receiving those things is very special but not receiving anything doesn't define you as a person or make you less valued!!! 1. I was raised on a small farm just outside of Cape Town. In a way I was blessed and privileged to be away from the pressures of city life and I grew up to appreciate the simpler things above the superficial. 2. I will chat about life on the farm, having no money but being blessed with amazing parents who never allowed me to be aware of my circumstances. Some 'looking back now' points somewhere after this would fit in. 3. After moving to PE and deciding to study Law despite our financial situation, I worked hard to be acknowledged as one of the top 15 per cent academics at university so that my studies could be 80% covered by bursaries and I worked to pay off the rest. 4. I broke my back towards the end of varsity. Learnt mobility again and made a massive life decision with regards to my career. I will elaborate on this part of my journey. 5. I was in an abusive relationship at the same time (his mother used to abuse him) and all together these factors encouraged my move to Jozi. 6. Despite my height disadvantage and the difficulty in general of breaking into the modeling industry, I put my head down and worked hard towards my dream. 7. I lost a lot of self worth during my last year in PE before I moved to Jozi and it took some serious soul searching to remind myself of my value in this world. 8. Being loved by others, although an amazing feeling to have the appreciation of others, does not define your place in the world. 9. Accept who you are. Acknowledge your absolute 'CAN DOS' in life and work on your 'MAYBES' so that you can be a better person for the ultimate upliftment of those around you. 10. No matter how many people say that they 'love' you, if you do not love your person then you will never step outside of the physical you. The physical you can only do so much if your mental you is lost inside of all the confusion. 11. Be brave. Always see the positive. Make your voice heard. Your physical seen. And the presence of your mental you felt. Its that culmination of your person that will leave a legacy and uplift. 12. I hope that you have the most amazing VD and that you are spoilt with love and roses and chocolates. Go home and tell your parents, siblings, neighbours that they are appreciated. You will go to bed with a happy heart and open mind for the future .","Model, 29, planned to say she had lost 'self worth' after relationship .

"Jailed: A Zimbabwean man has been jailed for likening a fellow pub-goer to president Robert Mugabe's bottom . A Zimbabwean man has been jailed for three months for likening a fellow pub-goer to president Robert Mugabe's bottom. Clemence Zikhali was imprisoned after a court ruled that he had broken the country's strict insult laws by calling the man 'a Mugabe's a***'. Mr Zikhali claimed in court that he had meant the comment as a joke and that he had not intended to offend the president. However, magistrate Sheila Nazombe rejected the claims and convicted the cement factory labourer of 'behaviour likely to cause public disorder'. Mr Zikhali made the remark at a bar in the small town of Gwanda, in south of the country, on the evening of Monday 4th February. In the course of an argument with the unnamed pub goer, he jokingly referred to the man as 'a Mugabe's a***', his lawyer told Bulewayo magistrates' court. The subject of the insult was a supporter of Mugabe's ruing Zanu-PF party. He reported the slur to the police. As a result, Mr Zikhali was arrested and held in police custody until his appearance at Bulewayo's magistrate's court last Friday. The three month prison sentence has outraged Mr Zikhali's family and supporters. The labourer's cousin Buletsi Nyathi said: 'We are just shocked with the sentence, it's so disturbing. We have since instructed our lawyers to appeal against the sentence.' His lawyer Norman Mangena said: 'He mentioned the president in jest while referring to a fellow patron in a bar. It was not a direct insult to the president.' Trouble: Mr Zikhali made the remark at a bar in the small town of Gwanda, pictured, in south of the country, on the evening of Monday 4th February . This is far from the first time that ordinary Zimbabweans have received harsh punishment for making seemingly innocuous jokes about the country's despotic ruler. Last February carpenter Richmore Mashinga Jazi, 48, was charged with 'undermining the authority of the president' when he mocked television pictures of the 88-year-old ruler's birthday. Mr Jazi's alleged comment of: 'Who helped Mugabe blow up his birthday balloons? Does he still have the energy?' led to police knocking on his door. At his subsequent trial, the state prosecutor claimed that Mr Jazi made the statement 'knowing that there was real risk or possibility that the statement was false' and that it could therefore 'cause hatred or contempt of the person of the President'. In 2011 Zebedia Mpofu, 52, was arrested after joking that a work colleague was only able to eat a packet of biscuits thanks to the country's main opposition party. Offend: Mr Zikhali claimed in court that he had meant the comment as a joke and that he had not intended to offend the president, pictured . The same year an opposition minister was incarcerated for calling Mugabe 'a liar' and another Zimbabwean arrested for calling Mugabe 'an idiot'. Though he is increasingly frail, Robert Mugabe, now aged 88, has ruled Zimbabwe for 33 years since its independence from Britain in 1980. Under his despotic regime, the country - once the 'bread basket of Southern Africa' - has fallen into penury. Three quarters of the country's population live on less than £1 a day. The former military leader has developed a fearsome, Soviet-style cult of personality and uses the police and courts to clamp down on dissent. Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR) has long argued that Mugabe abuses the country's insult laws for political gain.","Clemence Zikhali for calling the man 'a Mugabe's a***'

"The South African government has announced plans to deploy armed troops into its wildlife parks in a bid to protect the country’s rhinoceroses from poachers targeting the animals’ famous horns. The plans - which could see helicopter gunships patrol game parks’ skies and soldiers wearing night vision goggles on the ground - were announced as new figures show that more rhinos have been killed in South Africa this year than at any time since the colonial period. So far this year, a total of 588 of the magnificent beasts have been killed in South Africa by poachers working for Far Eastern crime syndicates which sell the animals’ horns for use in traditional medicine. Slaughtered: The carcass of a 24-year-old rhino cow at Finfoot Lake Reserve who was among eight slaughtered by poachers this month as figures showed more rhinos have been killed this year than any time since the colonial period . Most of the horns end up in being used in traditional medicine in China or Vietnam, where it is believed they are good for curing many types of ailments from cancer to impotency. The 558 rhino killed so far this year is far more than the 448 killed in South Africa throughout the whole of 2011 and almost 4,500 per cent more than the 13 rhino killed in South Africa just five years ago. Wildlife experts say that the poaching explosion has become so serious in South Africa - which has around 22,000 rhino and is home to 80 per cent of the world’s rhino population - that the white and black rhino species are in risk of become severely endangered. They warn that a tipping point has been reached as more rhinos are now dying than are being born. 'Cures' ailments: Poachers in South Africa are working for Far Eastern crime syndicates which sell the animals' horns for use in traditional medicine . Poaching explosion: The carcasses of a mother rhino and her calf rot after being killed by poachers as the amount of animals being killed has risen so much that white and black rhino species are in risk of become severely endangered . Earlier this month one poaching gang managed to kill eight rhino in South Africa’s Kruger National Park. The animals, which included one calf, were shot before their horns - worth £60,000 a kilo on the black market - were brutally hacked from their bodies. ‘The animals were also mutilated for their eyes and ears, while one female had her genitalia cut off,’ the International Fund for Animal Welfare’s director Jason Bell said. ‘The numbers of rhinos being poached for their horns grows and grows, with the numbers of rhinos killed in 2012 already almost double that what it was two years ago with most of those being in killed in the Kruger National Park, arguably wildlife’s best secured habitat.’ Deaths doubled: A baby rhino runs in Kruger National Park where the most animals are being killed even though it is arguably their 'best secured habitat' It was in response to these killings that the political leader of the South African region, which is home to most of the country’s rhino announced a plan to mobilise the army. ‘The cruelty and brutality against the rhino, as symbol of our ecology and rich heritage, has gone too far,’ North West premier Thandi Modise said. ‘Recent incidents dictate for extraordinary measures to protect our tourism and biodiversity.’ Ms Modise did not explain how the military would be used but previously mooted plans have included using soldiers with night vision goggles patrol the game parks after dark as well as having machine gun toting helicopters in the skies. Proponents of the extreme measure point out that the poaching syndicates are themselves well-armed, well-funded and well organised. Many poaching gangs themselves fly into the game parks by helicopter at night. They then use night vision equipment to either shoot the rhino at near point blank range or to tranquilise it before hacking it to death with machetes. Rhino horn is made of keratin, a tough protein found in human fingernails. There is no medical evidence to support beliefs that the horn is good for reducing ill-health. While there are no reliable statistics to back it up, it is thought that the number of rhino killed in recent years may have been surpassed by hunters during southern Africa’s colonial era when, at one point, there were only around 3,000 rhino left alive. 'Gone too far': The North West premier Thandi Modise says that recent brutality toward rhinos has led to 'extraordinary measures to protect our tourism and biodiversity'","More rhinos have been killed in South Africa this year than at any time since the colonial period .

"Nelson Mandela's trademark 'spirit and sparkle' is waning, his wife warned today as it emerged he is battling a recurring lung infection. Graca Machel told a South African television news channel that it was painful to see her 94-year-old husband, who was hospitalised on Saturday, 'fading.' 'I mean, this spirit and this sparkle, you see that somehow it's fading,' she told eNews Central Africa. To see him aging, it's something also which pains you. You understand and you know it has to happen', she said. Warning: . Nelson Mandela's trademark 'spirit and sparkle' is waning, his wife . Graca Machel  warned this morning. He made his last public appearance . alongside his wife at Johannesburg's Soccer City stadium during the . closing ceremony for the 2010 World Cup . Mr Mandela's grand-daughter Ndileka told the same news channel that the anti-apartheid icon has come to accept his condition. 'He has come to accept that it's part of growing old, and it's part of humanity as such', she said. 'At some point you will dependent on someone else, he has come to embrace it'. The pair's comments are the first official remarks by his family since the former President was rushed to hospital on Saturday. Mr Mandela was admitted to a military hospital on Saturday for treatment but it was not until today that doctors revealed his condition. The anti-apartheid leader is particularly susceptible to the ailment because of his age and his 27 years in prison though medics say he is responding well to treatment. He fought off a similar infection in 2011 and once contracted tuberculosis while imprisoned. Public concern: When Mandela was last hospitalised in December broadcast vans parked near the 1 Military Hospital eager for updates on his condition . Security: South African military police officers checked cars entering the 1 Military Hospital last year when Mr Mandela was hospitalised . Medical experts say respiratory . illnesses like pneumonia striking a man his age are a serious matter . that require care and monitoring. The announcement ended speculation . about what was troubling the ailing leader. His ongoing hospitalisation . has caused growing concern in South Africa, a nation of 50 million . people that largely reveres him for being the nation's first . democratically elected president who sought to bring the country . together after centuries of racial division. The tests Mr Mandela underwent at 1 . Military Hospital near South Africa's capital, Pretoria, detected the . lung infection, presidential spokesman Mac Maharaj said in a statement. 'Madiba is receiving appropriate . treatment and he is responding to the treatment,' Maharaj said, . referring to Mr Mandela by his clan name as many do in South Africa in a . sign of affection. In January 2011, Mr Mandela was . admitted to a Johannesburg hospital for what officials initially . described as tests but what turned out to be an acute respiratory . infection. The chaos that followed his stay at . that public hospital, with journalists and the curious surrounding it . and entering wards, saw the South African military take charge of his . care and the government control the information about his health. In recent days many in the press and . public have complained about the lack of concrete details that the . government has released about the former president's condition. Rallying round: Worshippers pray at the Regina Mundi Church in Soweto. Calls for prayer have been made for former president Nelson Mandela . Bated breath: During Mandela's last hospital stay South Africa was eagerly awaiting news of his condition . They had not divulged why he had been . flown over 500 miles from his rural home to undergo the urgent tests . prompting many to fear the worst. Over the weekend the South African . Sunday Times newspaper quoted a source as saying 'he has not been . talking. He is not looking good'. Yesterday, the country's defence . minister visited the Nobel Peace Prize winner at the Pretoria military . hospital in which he is being treated. Afterwards Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula . echoed the official, placatory message, telling reporters that Mr . Mandela was 'doing very, very well'. She added: 'It is important to keep . him in our prayers and also to be as calm as possible and not cause a . state of panic because I think that is not what all of us need.' Yesterday afternoon the office of President Jacob Zuma said that Mr Mandela 'had a good night's rest. The doctors will still conduct further tests today. He is in good hands.' Mr Mandela has a history with lung . problems. He fell ill with tuberculosis in 1988 toward the tail-end of . his prison years, after he had been moved from the notorious Robben . Island and to another jail to ease the apartheid government's efforts to . negotiate with him about a possible release. At first, doctors were uncertain why . he had a persistent cough that ultimately caused him to collapse during a . meeting with his lawyer. Relations: Mr Mandela's last foreign visitor is believed to have been US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who had lunch with him and his wife, Graca Machel, at their Qunu home in August . After being taken to a Cape Town hospital, a doctor told him he had water in his lungs. Mr Mandela initially refused to believe the doctor, he wrote in his autobiography Long Walk to Freedom. ‘With a hint of annoyance, (the . doctor) said, “Mandela, take a look at your chest,”’ Mr Mandela . recounted. ‘He pointed out that one side of my chest was actually larger . than the other.’ Surgeons immediately cut into his . chest and removed two litres (half a gallon) of liquid from his lungs, . which tested positive for tuberculosis. Doctors at the time suggested Mr Mandela contracted the disease from his damp prison cell. About 1.4 million people worldwide . die each year from tuberculosis, a bacterial infection which can stay . dormant for years. It also can cause permanent lung damage, though in . his autobiography Mr Mandela says doctors caught it in time. However, tuberculosis can return to . trouble those previously infected, properly treated or not, and previous . damage could have been missed, Openshaw said. Openshaw, who has not seen Mr . Mandela's medical records and spoke generally about treating patients, . said pneumonia is the most likely respiratory illness to affect an . elderly person, though others can strike as well. Doctors typically use antibiotics to . treat such infections, though there needed to be care made in deciding . how much of a dose to give an older patient. And there's the challenge of treating a patient that a nation and many around the world remain anxiously worried about. ‘It's particularly difficult if it's . in a special patient, where you really have to be very careful to try . not to overreact, but just to treat them as if they were any other . patient,’ Openshaw said. But the doctor later acknowledged the obvious: ;It's very hard to the balance right (for) a special, special patient.’ Mr Mandela was a leader in the . struggle against racist white rule in South Africa and once he emerged . from 27 years in prison in 1990, he won worldwide acclaim for urging . reconciliation. He won South Africa's first truly . democratic elections in 1994, serving one five-year term. The Nobel . laureate later retired from public life to live in his remote village of . Qunu, in the Eastern Cape, and last made a public appearance when his . country hosted the 2010 World Cup soccer tournament. Mr Mandela disengaged himself from . the country's politics over the last decade but continued campaigning . against AIDS. He has grown increasing frail in recent years. He went seven weeks of radiation therapy for prostate cancer in 2001, ultimately beating the disease. In February he underwent minor surgery to determine the cause of abdominal pain. Mr Mandela's last foreign visitor is believed to have been US Secretary . of State Hillary Clinton, who had lunch with him and his wife, Graca . Machel, at their Qunu home in August. In 2011 Mr Mandela's close friend Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu described him as being 'frail'. The churchman said: 'We want him to remain forever, but you know... anything can happen.'","Graca Machel told a South African television news channel that it was painful to see her 94-year-old husband, who was hospitalised on Saturday, 'fading'

A British engineer was murdered and his wife brutally beaten at their remote South African farm by robbers who took just £210 cash and a mobile phone. Chris Preece, 54, who made his home there after ‘falling in love with the country’ was hacked to death in his kitchen by a gang with machetes. His wife Felicity, 56, was stabbed and hit with a pole, fracturing her skull. She survived a 12-hour wait for help by treating her own wounds. The murder, on Saturday evening, is the latest in a spate of violent robberies in South Africa targeting relatively wealthy white farmers. Mr Preece, originally from Southgate, north London, was attacked at about 7pm as he went to take his seven dogs for a walk at his farm near Ficksburg, on the Lesotho border. The gang killed him, then attacked his wife. ‘Because the gang had cut the telephone wires and there is no mobile phone reception, she couldn’t get help,’ said friend and neighbour Gavin Hoole. ‘It was only the next morning, at around 7am, that anyone realised something was wrong.’ Mr Preece’s South African daughter-in-law Jeanne Preece said he had gone to the country in 1995 to work as a geotechnical engineer with diamond firm De Beers. ‘He fell in love with South Africa from day one,’ she said yesterday. Last year he was made principal geotechnical engineer for rival mining firm Snowden in . Johannesburg. He would drive 200 miles home to his wife every weekend. The couple kept horses and were in the process of transforming the farm into a nature reserve with cheetahs and birds of prey. Jeanne Preece, who is married to their son, said the couple, who have two daughters, were unaware there had been a murder and four robberies on local farms in the past month. Felicity Preece was yesterday said to be in a ‘stable but traumatised state’ in hospital. The region: Mr Preece was murdered just outside of Ficksburg which is on the border of Lesotho . Mr Preece's death is the latest in an alarming trend of brutal murders on remote farmsteads in post apartheid South Africa. Since . the country's first fully democratic elections in 1994, more than 3,000 . white, mainly Afrikaans, farmers have been killed in their homes. The so-called 'farm attacks' are part of the wave of criminality that has engulfed the country in recent years, something criminologist blame of a number of factors, including inept policing and widening social inequality. But in the case of 'farm attacks' - which occur far from the crime-ravaged townships - academics also blame a breakdown in the traditional social contract between employer and employee. Police research shows that the murders are normally carried out by drug-addicted, unemployed black men. Often they have some connection with the targeted farmstead. Local police said the attack at Mr Preece's farm - called Fleur de Lys - is the fifth such attack, and the second murder, in the district over the past month. Yesterday Jeanne Preece told the local Volksblad newspaper how Mr Preece had moved to South Africa in 1995 for work, after which he had 'fallen in love' with the country. He worked as principal geotechnical engineer for mining firm Snowden and was based in the country's commercial capital Johannesburg. However he spent every weekend on the farm, 200 miles drive away, where he wife Felicity lived. The couple were passionate about wildlife and welcomed local children to the farm to teach them to ride horses. Rural: A wave of attacks on farms has been blamed on social inequality (pictured is a general view of the area near Ficksburg where Mr Preece's farmstead lies) It had been the couple's dream to turn the farm, which is set in rolling green hills, into a nature reserve and rehabilitation resort for owls and cheetahs. He was especially looking forward to seeing all his family over Christmas, Mrs Preece said. Yesterday a spokesman for the hospital at which Mrs Preece is being treated said she is in a 'stable but traumatized state'. Local police spokesman Captain Phumelelo Dhlamini said police were alerted to the attack by a worker who discovered the bloody scene as he arrived for work on Sunday morning. He said the murder weapons were found in the house. Police have not yet arrested anyone in connection with the attack, which locals believe to have been committed by men who crossed the nearby border from Lesotho.","Chris Preece's wife was also injured in the attack which happened after robbers poisoned their guard dogs .

"Secret deal? Mandela's grandson, tribal chieftain Mandla Mandela (above), denies claims he sold rights to his grandfather's funeral for £250,000 . Nelson Mandela's grandson has been forced to deny that he secretly sold television broadcast rights for the anti-apartheid icon's funeral to the BBC. Mandla Mandela has been accused of selling exclusive rights to film the anti-apartheid campaigner's funeral for around £250,000. The tribal chieftain, 37, is alleged to have cut a deal with the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) in conjunction with the BBC. Mandla's first wife Thando claimed he made the deal in 2009 - well before his grandfather, now 93, experienced his recent bout of health problems. She claimed he received three million South African rand (£248,000) for the arrangement. As part of the couple's divorce battle Thando Mabunu-Mandela has forced her ex-husband - now a leading figure within the Mandela family - to make a legal statement on issue. And this week Mandla Mandela told a court: 'I am not in possession of any written agreement with either the SABC or BBC or any other broadcasting company or corporation for the broadcast rights to Mr Nelson Mandela's funeral, as such agreement does not exist and I do not possess such rights.' Icon: The former South Africa president celebrates his 93rd birthday with family members in July last year. He has been in ailing health and last month underwent surgery for a stomach complaint . Using the term 'M-plans', the world's . news organisations have for years been planning how best to cover Nelson . Mandela's funeral. They have staked out locations, booked hotels and even pre-arranged pundits in anticipation of a global news event to which every living US president, the British prime minister and many other world leaders are expected to attend. The intense level of preparation is, from a television executive's perspective, understandable. But many South Africans have been offended by the sense of anticipation of the much-loved statesman's death. So great is the national . affection for the country's first black president that any perceived . lack of respect for his dignity is taken extremely seriously. Much-loved: Many South Africans are offended by the anticipation surrounding Mr Mandela's death . The recent revelation that two international news agencies - Associated Press and Reuters - had installed television cameras on top of telegraph poles in Nelson Mandela's home village of Qunu provoked fury locally, despite the fact that the cameras were turned off and would only be activated when the funeral started. Mandla has also attracted criticism for ordering that the bodies of three of the former president's children be exhumed from their home village of Qunu and reburied in the nearby hamlet of Mvezo where he is a chief. Mandla's motive, say his critics - some of whom are within the Mandela family itself - that the former president will also be buried in Mvezo: something that is sure to act as a lure for big-spending tourists. Mandla Mandela's personal life has also been criticised. While polygamy is legal in South African tribal law, he has been accused of breaching a court's order to marry his second and third wives while divorce proceedings against the first are still active. Nelson Mandela, now 93, has previously been treated for prostate cancer, tuberculosis and damage to his eyes. Last month, he underwent surgery for a stomach condition.","Mandla Mandela accused of cutting £250,000 deal ."
"Guilty: Mziwamadoda Qwabe has admitted to the murder of Anni Dewani . A hitman has made fresh claims that honeymooner Anni Dewani’s murder was ordered by her husband. Mziwamadoda Qwabe said the killing in his native South Africa was designed to appear like ‘a random criminal act’. He claimed he was told that businessman Shrien Dewani  ‘wanted the wife killed’ and that it had to look like a robbery. Qwabe, 27, claimed he helped to hijack the couple’s taxi and was behind the wheel when a second hitman, sitting beside him, turned round and shot Mrs Dewani, 28, in the neck. The father of three’s previously unheard story was laid out in his signed confession document accepted by Cape Town’s High Court yesterday. He admitted kidnapping, robbery, owning an unlicensed gun and premeditated murder. While these crimes would normally merit life in prison, Qwabe received 25 years and will be eligible for parole in 17 years, under the terms of a plea bargain to testify against Dewani, 32, from Bristol. Dewani adamantly rejects accusations that he commissioned and paid for the murder in November 2010. His most recent extradition hearing . was told that he is mentally unfit to return to South Africa for trial . due to post-traumatic stress disorder and severe depression. Scroll down for video . Hiding: Mziwamadoda Qwabe covers his face with his jacket as he sits in the dock at court in Cape Town . Happier times: Shrien Dewani (left) is accused of arranging the murder of his wife Anni (right) In his confession, Qwabe named Dewani . as a co-conspirator in kidnapping, murder and robbery, and says he was . recruited for the ‘job’ by taxi driver Zola Tongo, who was jailed for 18 . years for his role in the crime. Yesterday Mrs Dewani’s uncle, Ashok . Hindocha, said: ‘We are just happy. Two of the accused have now pleaded . guilty. Now we want to know what really happened to Anni, why they . killed her.’ But he added: ‘I would have been much, . much happier if all the accused were in South Africa and . cross-examination took place and the truth could be found. ‘To us, Anni is still not dead. We . haven’t started the mourning process. We can’t.

Shrien Dewani has always protested his . innocence in the case of his wife Anni's murder. The South African . authorities claim there is evidence of his involvement but Dewani's . supporters have answers for many of the questions raised. Why did the Dewanis enlist the services of cabbie Zola Tongo instead of using a designated hotel taxi? A . Dewani family spokesman said there was nothing unusual in jumping into a . taxi on arrival at a foreign airport. The trip to South Africa had been . 'very last minute', he said, and the Cape Grace hotel where the couple . were staying had just one luxury limousine transfer that had to be . booked in advance, costing 600 rand (£56) per journey. Why was Dewani not harmed in the incident when his wife was driven off and killed? Dewani's . friends say he made every possible effort to save her. They say he was . ejected from the cab in a township and did not know where he was. He . went knocking on doors and tried to summon help, they said. Dewani is . also reported to have said he was dragged out of the vehicle, struggling . throughout. Why did the couple choose to visit Gugulethu, an area known to be unsafe? The . honeymooners were said to have wanted to see the 'real' South Africa. It has also been claimed that Tongo suggested he take them to a place . where they could see some African dancing and that the couple were . lukewarm about going. Why did CCTV footage show Dewani chatting to Tongo for 13 minutes shortly after his arrival at the Cape Grace hotel? Dewani's . supporters have reportedly claimed he was discussing with the taxi . driver his and Mrs Dewani's plans for the next few days. Why did CCTV footage from the hotel three days after the murder show . Tongo apparently receiving a white plastic packet from Dewani, . supporting the taxi driver's claim that he was paid for the hit that . day?

"Essential work on planned reservoirs in Zimbabwe has stopped because mermaids have been hounding workers away, according to the country's Water Resources Minister. Samuel Sipepa Nkomo told a Zimbabwean parliamentary committee that terrified workers are refusing to return to the sites, near the towns of Gokwe and Mutare. Minister Nkomo said the only way to . solve the problem was to brew traditional beer and carry out any rites . to appease the spirits. African artist's impression of mermaids: The Zimbabwean government has blamed delays to two essential infrastructure projects on 'the presence of mermaids' The country's Water Resources Minister claimed that mermaids have been hounding workers away from the two planned new reservoirs . 'All the officers I have sent have . vowed not to go back there', Minister Nkomo was reported as saying in . Zimbabwe's state-approved Herald newspaper. Samuel Sipepa Nkomo told a Zimbabwean parliamentary committee that terrified workers are refusing to return to the sites, near the towns of Gokwe and Mutare . Mermaids are mythological water . creatures with a female body twinned with the tail of a fish. Opinion about the existence of mermaids varies throughout Zimbabwe - some people are skeptical, but some firmly believe that mermaids exist in Zimbabwe. Dating back centuries, many mermaid stories continue to . make their rounds in Zimbabwe. One tale says mermaids carry humans . underwater, but if there is a public outcry their relatives might never . see them again. But another tale suggests victims can return as spirit . mediums if their disappearance is not mourned. The senior politician said that mermaids were also present in other reservoirs. 'We even hired whites thinking that our boys did not want to work but they also returned saying they would not return to work there again,' he added. The two, long overdue reservoirs are considered essential if Zimbabwe is provide adequate water to its population and to boost its agricultural production. Having once been the 'bread basket' of Southern Africa, the country's farms have been laid low by lack of faith in government policy. From 2000, President Robert Mugabe expropriated some 4,000 white owned farms and gave them to politically connected blacks. Partly as a result, agricultural production is this year forecast to be at its second lowest level since Zimbabwe achieved independence from Britain in 1980. The belief in mermaids and other mythical creatures is widespread in the country, where many people combine a Christian faith with traditional beliefs. Local Government, Rural and Urban Development Minister Ignatius Chombo said the government wants to give the population the water it needs, but cannot do so until the rituals are performed and necessary repairs can be carried out. Three quarters of Zimbabwe's population live on less than one US dollar a day.","Minister Nkomo said the only way to .

"The mystery over which congressman called New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand 'chubby' was seemingly solved this morning. The New York Times outed late Hawaii Senator Daniel Inouye, a Democrat, as the man who made the offensive comment in the inaugural edition of it's political newsletter. A spokesman for Gillibrand, who is also a Democrat, didn't confirm that Inouye was the unnamed colleague who the 47-year-old female Senator referred to in her recently released memoir but he didn't deny it was Inouye, either. New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democrat, asks questions at a Senate Armed Services hearing last week in Washington, D.C. Gillibrand has attracted attention over her claim that a male colleague called her 'chubby' after the birth of her second son . Today the New York Times announced that late Hawaii Sen. Daniel Inouye, also a Democrat, was the culprit . Inouye, a World War II veteran and Medal of Honor recipient, died in 2012. At the time of his death, President Barack Obama called him a 'true American hero' and said he was 'revered by all of us lucky enough to know him.' But as the Times points out, Inouye may not have been Boy Scout. In 1992 Inouye's former hairdresser claimed the senator made her have sex with him. The same year a Hawaii state senator accused Inouye of sexually harassing nine other women who wished to remain anonymous. The Times said today that sources familiar with the Gillibrand incident claim Inouye was the cheeky male colleague who told the female Senator after she had her second son, 'Don’t lose too much weight now. I like my girls chubby!' Gillibrand served with Inouye in the Senate from 2009 until his death two years ago. Gillibrand is pictured here with her husband Jonathan and their two sons Henry, left, and Theordore . Gillibrand first made the claim that a male colleague called her 'chubby' in her memoir, released last month . While Gillibrand's office wouldn't tell the Times if Inouye was indeed the culprit, Gillibrand described the man who made the remark  as 'one of my favorite older members of the Senate' in her recently released memoir, Off the Sidelines: Raise Your Voice, Change the World. Conservative pundits inferred from the statement that Gillibrand was likely referring to a fellow a Democrat, which is why she didn't want to name names. The Times' reporting suggests they may have been right. It still remains a secret which congressman called Gillibrand 'porky' and which lawmaker told her 'you're even pretty when you're fat.' The only clues Gillibrand has offered to their perpetrators' identities is that they were older men. 'It was all statements that were being made by men who were well into their 60s, 70s or 80s,' she told People magazine last month. 'They had no clue that those are inappropriate things to say to a pregnant woman or a woman who just had a baby or to women in general.'","The New York Times claims that late Hawaii Sen.

"As the resident builder on the  TV garden makeover show Ground Force, the pressure on Tommy Walsh was to complete an amazing transformation in record time. So it's rather ironic that the first property development he embarked upon with his own cash took him a decade to complete. Tommy is now selling the three-bedroom house, which  he rebuilt from a dilapidated shell, for £299,950. The project, ten minutes from Stansted Airport in the town of Great Dunmow, Essex, took  him so long because he was offered his life-changing role  on Ground Force in 1997 - just after he bought the building. Tommy Walsh at his property at Gt Dunmow in Essex . In its prime, the hit BBC show drew audiences of 12 million. Tommy, then a successful self-employed builder, was catapulted to fame alongside the original team of Charlie Dimmock and Alan Titchmarsh. Tommy paid £29,000 for the near derelict building - which was originally used as a school within a Victorian workhouse complex. The workhouse was designed by renowned architect Sir George Gilbert Scott, who later created the iconic frontage at St Pancras station. Tommy's building had stood empty for 20 years after a botched attempt to convert it into a home. He bought it directly from a bank after it was repossessed. 'It had failed to sell at auction and was completely uninhabitable,' he explains. He had plans to turn it into a three-bedroom weekend retreat for his family, with the help of his father, Jim, also a builder and a manufacturer of building materials. Alan Titchmarsh, Charlie Dimmock and Tommy Walsh of Ground Force . 'Cement is in my blood. I was working with my dad on a Saturday from the age of four,' Tommy,  57, says. Applying for planning permission took more than two years because of the building's Grade II listed status. 'My dad and I used to come here in the winter months when filming was over,' says Tommy, pointing to photos which show his old Ground Force truck parked outside the building site. Other snaps show Tommy's sidekick from the show, Willy, helping to install the spiral staircase which leads down to the basement, where they added a third bedroom. It was a massive project - three-quarters of the building had to be completely rebuilt including the roof, chimney-stack and external walls. Tommy and his father painstakingly recreated original features such as the distinctive diamond pattern brickwork, cast iron windows and copings on the edge of the roof. 'The planners told me it was an improvement on the original design, which is something I'd like written on my headstone,' he says proudly. Sadly Tommy's father never got to see him complete the project as he died in 1999 at the age of 77. Once the house was complete, Tommy found his three children, now in their 20s, preferred to be at the family home in Hackney, East London, at weekends. So he let  the property for seven years. He is selling now because, as a landlord, he prefers his rental properties to be closer to his Hackney house. Despite his fame, Tommy remains grounded. 'I still live in Hackney, where I was born and bred,' he says. 'Family life is important to me and simple pleasures like football and the odd beer. I'm not particularly extravagant.' Tommy Walsh's house at Dunmow during rebuilding . His home is a stunning four-storey, four-bedroom Victorian property that he did up himself. But he talks with disbelief about his nearby childhood home, bought by his father for £1,200 in 1956, which sold for £1.2 million three years ago: 'It's now worth nearer  £3 million. It's a shame because it means Hackney is now too expensive for a lot of the original inhabitants. Everyone deserves a right to expect a roof over their head.' Ground Force finished in 2005 and Tommy went on to appear in several other property shows, although none ever quite as popular. He continues  to run his building business and is currently renovating two houses in  Hackney, which he will let out. Once he sells in Great Dunmow, he has his eye on a flat, again in East London, overlooking the Regent's Canal in Bethnal Green. He plans to improve and extend it. According to Martin Nash at selling agents Mullucks Wells, prices in Essex are increasing at a gentler rate than the current boom in the London market - and are still about five per cent below 2008 levels. lwww.mullucks.co.uk .

"Luke Batty's father told ambulance workers to let him die after he killed his 11-year-old son at a Victorian cricket oval during a custody visit. Greg Anderson was covered with blood and holding a knife when he lunged at emergency services workers called to the Tyabb oval on February 12, an inquest into Luke's death has heard. The 54-year-old was shot by police and said 'let me die' as paramedics attempted to treat him, the Victorian Coroners Court heard on Monday. Scroll down for video . Greg Anderson, 56, killed his son Luke Batty, 11, on the Tyabb oval in Victoria on February 12 . Mr Anderson and Luke were practising in the cricket nets, 'substantially on their own', when the attack happened, but it was witnessed by an eight-year-old boy, the inquest heard . Mr Anderson and Luke were practising in the cricket nets, 'substantially on their own', when the attack happened, but it was witnessed by an eight-year-old boy, the inquest heard. Luke died after Mr Anderson struck him with a cricket bat and attacked him with a knife. The boy saw Mr Anderson raise the bat over his right shoulder but did not see it connect with Luke. Luke died after Mr Anderson struck him with a cricket bat and attacked him with a knife during a custody visit . He ran and told his father, who called paramedics. When emergency services workers arrived they saw Mr Anderson kneeling by Luke. At first they thought he was helping him, the inquest heard. When ambulance workers tried to approach Luke, Mr Anderson said 'he's in heaven now'. Mr Anderson died in hospital from gunshot wounds and self-inflicted knife wounds. The inquest heard that in the months before he killed his son, Mr Anderson once held up a knife while talking to Luke and said: 'This could be the one to end it all.' Luke reported the incident to police and a child protection officer, but told them that he loved his father and was not in fear of him, the inquest heard. Luke's mother, Rosie Batty, said she had always wanted her son to have a relationship with his father. 'For me it's really important a child should know his father,' she told the inquest. 'Greg was really loving and keen to be involved in Luke's life. 'But I said to myself this is a journey, I'll keep doing things that feel right until they didn't feel right anymore.' Ms Batty said she changed her mind in April 2013 when Luke revealed his father had shown him the knife while Anderson prayed in his car. 'I was so alarmed I knew I could no longer support his relationship with his father,' Ms Batty said. Mr Anderson's contact with Luke was restricted by an intervention order from May 2012, but that was changed to block access to his son in April 2013. An inquest into Luke's death has heard Mr Anderson begged Ambulance workers to 'let him die' Counsel assisting the inquest, Rachel Ellyard, said the order was changed again in July 2013 to allow Mr Anderson access to Luke at football and cricket matches on the weekend. Ms Ellyard said Mr Anderson was technically in breach of that order by seeing Luke at cricket training on a weekday. The inquest heard Ms Batty was not told Mr Anderson had failed to appear in court on charges of assault and not answering bail. She learned that Anderson's housemate sought and was granted an intervention order in January this year through media reports. Ms Batty said when she saw Mr Anderson at the cricket oval on the night of Luke's death it occurred to her to call the police, but she decided not to. When ambulance workers tried to approach Luke, Mr Anderson said 'he's in heaven now' Luke's mother Rosie Batty (pictured) said she had always wanted her son to have a relationship with his father . She said she had previously had unpleasant situations trying to get the police involved at the cricket club. Ms Batty said she didn't trust the situation, and previous attempts had been traumatic, stressful and unpredictable. She said she thought: 'This will be the third time I've tried to get this man arrested in front of Luke and his friends at that bloody oval.' The police had Anderson's address, so she thought it would be better if they arrested him there, discretely, Ms Batty told the inquest. Ms Ellyard said key issues to be explored during the inquest included the assessments of Mr Anderson made by police and the Department of Human Services (DHS) and the supervision orders dictating Mr Anderson's contact with Luke. The information sharing between Ms Batty, the DHS and police, and any changes DHS and police have made to their procedures since Luke's murder, would also be investigated. More broadly, Ms Ellyard said the inquest would look into whether there were any signs Anderson had the potential for violence towards Luke and whether they could have been acted on. *Readers seeking support and information about suicide prevention can contact Lifeline on 13 11 14 or Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467.","Greg Anderson, 56, was shot  by police after lunging at emergency workers .

Her mother shared the good news by posting a photo of her daughter in a wheelchair today. Scroll down for video . Keep praying: Natalie Jo Eaton's mother shared this photo of he daughter as she starts rehab for a spinal injury suffered after she was accidentally impaled by a golf club . She asks that everyone continue to pray for her daughter. According to authorities, Eaton was attending a rush party at Arkansas State University's Kappa Alpha fraternity, having a cookout and playing games around 6 pm on Aug. 19 when a 19-year-old man threw a football at a 20-year-old man, and the 20-year-old hit it baseball-style with a golf club. But when the club made contact with the football, the shaft snapped and hurled at Eaton, traveling over 30 ft. and impaling her in the neck. Doctors say the club hit a major artery and her spinal cord and initially told friends and family she may be paralyzed. Tragedy: the horrible accident happened on the Eaton's second day of college at Arkansas State University . But the immediate response of the man who caused the accident may have reduced that threat. 'His quick reactions probably saved her life,' said Eaton's best friend Makaleigh Riddle. The unnamed student held Eaton's head up for 15 minutes, applying pressure to the wound, until an ambulance showed up. Eaton was then taken to St Bernard's in critical condition, before then being transferred to Memphis. No charges have been reported, but university officials said shortly after the incident in August that they didn't expect students to face any, according to NBC 5.","Natalie Jo Eaton was attending a fraternity rush party on Aug. 19 when she was impaled .

"Four thousand years ago, the inhabitants of Dartmoor traded beads, were skilled weavers - and cremated their dead before building burial mounds. Specialist scanning equipment at a hospital's spinal unit has offered a once-in-a-lifetime glimpse into the personal possessions of a Briton 4,000 years ago. A bag unearthed in a Dartmoor burial site in Devon could prove to be one of the most important archaeological finds of the last 100 years. Radiographer Mile Woodford at Salisbury District Hospital prepares to x-ray an early Bronze Age bag excavated from a Dartmoor burial site in Devon which could prove to be one of the most important archaeological finds of the last 100 years . Cremated human bones were among the items found in the burial chest, known as a cist, during the dig on Whitehorse Hill on Dartmoor, Devon . Cists are common in the south-west of England and elsewhere, with 200 known on Dartmoor alone. But they are rarely found with their original contents. Experts said the one discovered on Whitehorse Hill may have been better preserved because it is the only known example set within a peat mound. The cist was first discovered more than ten years ago when what appeared to be its end stone fell out of the peat mound which had been concealing it. After several attempts to protect the cist - a scheduled monument - the decision was taken by DNPA and English Heritage to excavate it in order to recover any surviving archaeological and environmental information before it is destroyed. The excavation, which took place in August, was the first excavation of a Dartmoor cist for nearly 100 years and involved experts from Cornwall Council's historic environment projects team, with assistance from English Heritage and specialists from the University of Plymouth. The excavation, co-ordinated by Dartmoor National Park Authority, discovered the collection of early Bronze Age remains in a burial cist - a stone chest containing the ashes and belongings of a dead person - on Whitehorse Hill last year. Now, under the expert eyes of Wiltshire Council's conservation service the items are being X-rayed to see what secrets they may be hiding. Senior conservator Helen Williams took the objects to the spinal unit at Salisbury District Hospital, in Wiltshire. A preliminary X-ray revealed the contents of a woven bag found on the site, which will now also be examined. Ms Williams said: ‘The level of preservation of the objects within the cist burial is excellent with a number of different materials present. ‘We have a real opportunity to research these finds and potentially discover more about the individual buried there.’ The excavation in August 2011 revealed that cremated human bone and burnt textile was placed within an animal hide or with fur on top. Archaeologists also found a delicate woven bag or basket with fine stitching still visible and containing preserved shale disc beads, amber spherical beads and a circular textile band. Although around 200 burial cists are known on Dartmoor, they are rarely found with their original contents.

"This is the Earth's song, pinging out contended chirrups into deep space. The haunting sounds have been captured by Nasa's twin Radiation Belt Storm Probe . (RBSP) satellite, which launched on August 30 this year. The satellites captured the chirping and whistling radio waves . emitted by Earth’s magnetosphere on September 5. The sound is known as 'Earth's chorus' and can be heard by human ears - that is, assuming you could take your helmet off while floating in space. Craig Kletzing, from the University of Iowa, is the principal . investigator of the  Electric and Magnetic Field Instrument Suite and . Integrated Science (EMFISIS) instruments on-board the satellites. The sounds of Earth: As charged solar particles hit the inner and outer radiation belts around our planet, they get caught and whipped around, emitting the sounds which you can hear below . He said: 'People have known about chorus for decades. 'Radio receivers . are used to pick it up, and it sounds a lot like birds chirping. 'It was . often more easily picked up in the mornings, which along with the . chirping sound is why it’s sometimes referred to as ""dawn chorus"".' The radio waves are at frequencies which can be heard from the human . ear, but sadly you might need to be in space and without a helmet - which is not medically advisable. You might also encounter the tricky problem of sound not travelling through the vacuum. The sounds are emitted by energetic particles in the upper levels of Earth’s magnetosphere, before they get whipped around by the radiation belts circling the Earth. The satellites trail each other around the Earth in elliptical orbits - sometimes as low as 375 miles about the ground, other times up to 20,000 miles above us. They are aiming to study the Van Allen belts that circle the Earth, in particular the various particles that make up the radiation belts. The Van Allen belts are streams of particles, which arrive in Earth's vicinity from the solar winds and get caught in Earth's magnetic field. Nicky Fox, the deputy project scientist at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, said: 'If you imagine having two buoys in the ocean, and one goes up, and comes down again, you don't know anything about what caused that to go up and down, . 'If both of them go up, then you know you've got a very big feature that is affecting both of them at the same time. If you one goes up, then the other goes up, you can measure how fast that wave has traveled between them, and what direction it's going into. 'And if only one goes up and comes down again, then you've got a very, very localised feature that didn't travel anywhere. 'So in order to be able to really understand what is going on, these very fine-scale features in our radiation belts, we have two spacecraft to do that.' There is poetic justice - or more likely intent - in Kletzing heading up the research at the University of Iowa - as that is where James Van Allen first studied the belts in the 1950s.",Earth's magnetic belt - capturing solar winds particles - sends out songs into deep space .
"It may look more like a high tech water pistol or something out of a sci-fi film than the latest weapon in the fight against crime. But an innovative new tagging system using a gun and DNA pellets could make it easier for police to mark the cards of even the most volatile criminal. Unlike a taser or gun that fires real bullets, the weapon won't hurt a suspect or render them incapacitated so that officers can pounce. Scroll down for video . Latest gadget: UK-based company Selectamark has unveiled a new weapon in the fight against crime - a gun that fires DNA pellets to mark suspects for identification at a later date during volatile police situations . Instead, it will enable police to stay . at a safe distance during trouble and identify criminals and arrest . criminals days or even weeks after an incident. The High Velocity DNA Tagging System, designed for use by police forces and the military by Kent-based firm Selectamark, fires small soft green pellets containing the transparent material at a target from as far away as 40 metres. Each pellet, which weighs less than a gram and is effectively like a paintball, contains a unique DNA code which could remain on the target for weeks. Andrew Knights from Selectamark said: 'On contact with the target the uniquely-coded SelectaDNA solution leaves a synthetic DNA trace mark that will enable the relevant authorities to confirm or eliminate that person from their involvement in a particular situation and could ultimately lead to arrest and prosecution.' The material is small enough to penetrate through clothing and mark a suspect's skin as well as their clothing, the firm said. The gun comes in both pistol and shotgun form, with the power to fire 20 shots in one session. Tagging: The gun fires small green pellets, like paintballs, which don't hurt suspects but leave a unique DNA trace which can last weeks . It will prove useful for officers when policing riots or when facing crowd control problems, say the brains behind the futuristic invention. It could also be used when an officer is giving chase to an offender and is unable to keep up. The DNA tag can be identified later on using a UV light and is designed to ensure that officers are arresting the right person. The company unveiled the new product in Nevada, in the U.S last week, and said the response had been incredible. 'It's been 12 months in development, even though it only launched a few days ago, there has been a huge amount of interest,' said Jason Brown of Selectamark. 'We are in talks with several UK police forces, and other around the world. 'this is one of many tools  in the police arsenal for a riot situation, and we believe its a deterrent, because it's orange, people would know they can be tagged and would disperse.' The gun also has a laser sight, and video and audio recording capabilities to collect evidence. 'Each officer has a batch of DNA signed out to them, and when combined with the video and audio we think this provides a substantial amount of evidence.' The firm has even trained a sniffer to recognise the material, allowing police to detain crowds and easily find those who have been tagged. The gun is an extension of an existing property marking system offered by the company which is used by businesses and homeowners across the world. Last year, police in Nelson, Lancashire, saw a 100 per cent reduction in burglary when they offered SelectDNA marking to 600 local residents. It was also revealed earlier this month that fast food giant McDonald's teamed up with the firm to install a spray in more than 700 stores which covers thieves in DNA linking them to a specific crime for several months. The chain took the drastic action following a spate of robberies in its Australian outlets over Christmas and New Year. Volatile: The gun could help police to track suspects involved in riots such as those which hit London in 2011 (pictured) Individual signature: Each round of  pellets contains a unique strand of DNA . Selectamark says that its products, including the new gun, uniquely mark valuable products in the home or criminals themselves with a synthetic DNA. Each round of pellets in the High Velocity DNA Tagging system features a unique DNA code, meaning that an individual criminal who is shot by one of the pellets, can be traced back to the scene using a specific forensic signature. Following an incident, details of codes are recorded on a police and insurance approved database so that when DNA is found on a suspect it can be matched against an incident. The company say that the DNA in the pellets is completely synthetic so the number of unique codes is infinite. The system cannot be hacked as prior knowledge of special 'key codes' is needed to identify the DNA strands. This means that the type of code read by police cannot be copied or made up by third parties. The pellet does not hurt criminals nor is it toxic and the DNA contains a UV tracer so that the mark left on a suspect can be found if they stand under a special lamp.","British firm behind the gun in talks with several UK police forces .

"It sounds like something only a Bond villain would propose, but the Nazis planned a mile-wide ‘space gun’ powered by the sun. The giant mirror could be used to focus the sun on a target – like the magnifying glasses used by children to create fire. A long-forgotten article from Life magazine in 1945 revealed how ‘US Army technical experts came up with the astonishing fact that German scientists had seriously planned to build a “sun gun”’. The mile wide mirror would be able to focus the power of the sun onto a target on Earth . The giant orbital mirror would ‘focus . the sun’s rays to a scorching point on the Earth’s surface’. The German . army, readers were told, ‘hoped to use such a mirror to burn an enemy . city or to boil part of an ocean’. The idea came to renowned rocket scientist Hermann Oberth in 1923. With an estimated cost of three . million marks and taking 15 years to construct, the original purpose of . the space mirror was to provide the  people of Earth with sunshine on . demand, anywhere on the globe. But Oberth later described it as the . ‘ultimate weapon’. ‘My space mirror,’ he wrote, ‘is like . the hand mirrors that schoolboys use to flash circles of sunlight on . the ceiling of their classroom. A sudden beam flashed on the teacher’s . face may bring unpleasant reactions.’ Hermann Oberth, the man behind the 'sun gun' Hermann Oberth was an Austro-Hungarian-born German physicist and engineer. He . is considered one of the founding fathers of rocketry and astronautics, . and constructed his first model rocket as a school student of 14. In . 1928 and 1929 Oberth worked in Berlin as scientific consultant on the . first film ever to have scenes set in space, Frau im Mond (The Woman in . the Moon), directed at UFA-Film Co. by Fritz Lang, although he lost the . sight in his left eye in an experiment for this film. In . autumn 1929, Oberth launched his first liquid fuel rocket, named . Kegeldüse, helped by his students at the Technical University of Berlin, . one of whom was Wernher von Braun, who would later head the wartime . project to develop the rocket officially called the A4, but far better . known today as the V-2 - which incorporated many of his inventions and . ideas. Oberth eventually came to work for his former student, Wernher von Braun, who was developing space rockets for Nasa, and  retired in 1962 at the age of 68 . In 1945, when the victorious Allies . began sifting through captured war plans, it emerged that the Nazis had . updated Oberth’s proposals and begun looking into the possibility of the . Third Reich building a mirror weapon in orbit 22,236 miles above the . Earth. Details of the sun gun emerged again after they were discussed by US military experts and appeared on internet forums. The secret plans by Adolf Hitler's Nazi party were only found at the end of the war . Life magazine believed it would be . put into orbit in pre-assembled sections. It would also contain a manned . space station, with 30ft holes in which supply rockets could dock, . hydroponic gardens to provide oxygen and solar-powered generators for . electric power. Once in orbit, the ‘master rocket’ for the project would unreel six cables. Spinning the rocket on its axis . would extend the cables radially, allowing construction to begin. The Germans are not the only nation . to look into harnessing  the power of the sun. In 1999, the Russians . unveiled a plan to use a mirror to reflect sunlight to Earth during . winter. The giant mirror would be assembled in space, and also contain a manned space station .

"This vast white landscape is covered in a blanket of stunning ice sculptures which are creations of nature. The naturally formed ice blocks, named ice hummocks, have been created due to the extreme weather conditions. Freezing temperatures and fierce winds causes fresh ice and ice floes to move, resulting in these picturesque blocks. The ice hummocks, created through a combination of extreme winds and cold temperatures, can reach a height of 15m (50ft) Snow glow area: The huge blocks of ice appear to glow bright blue as they catch the sun . The ice hummocks can reach a height of 15m (50ft) and photographer Alexey Trofimov was awed by the amazing sights surrounding him. The snapper took the photos at Lake Baikal in the south of the Russian region of Siberia, where temperatures can plummet to minus 38 degrees Celsius. The lake itself is a natural wonder. It is at least 25 million years old and is known as one of the largest and deepest lakes in the world. Lake Baikal also holds one-fifth of the world's fresh water. Out of the blue: The 'sculptures' stand out against the otherwise barren landscape . Ice and a slice: This piece of ice looks as though it has been carved by hand, rather than formed by the wind .

'There's still a lot of unexplored places in Lake Baikal and my job as a photographer is to show people the miracles of the nature here. 'On Lake Baikal everything is very stunning and unusual, the place does not cease to surprise. 'I am pleased with my photos but I want to go back and take some more interesting and unusual shots.

"It has eluded some of the world's finest minds for more than a century. Mathematicians, cryptographers and linguists have all tried and failed to solve the message inside the 'the world's most mysterious medieval manuscript'. The repeated failures to find anything has led many to claim that the so-called Voynich book is a hoax. Discovery: A new study has claimed that the Voynich book  - which dates back to the early 1400s - may hold a genuine message . Mysterious: The book has been dated to the early 1400s, but it largely disappeared from public record until 1912 . However, a new study has claimed that the book - which dates back to the early 1400s - may hold a genuine message. Scientists studying the mysterious text say they have found linguistic patterns which could be meaningful words hidden within the text. Marcelo Montemurro, a theoretical physicist from the University of Manchester, says he believes his research - which has been published in the journal Plos One -  could eventually lead to unraveling the mystery of the manuscript. Strange:  Mathematicians, cryptographers and linguists have all tried and failed to solve the message inside the manuscript . Speaking to the BBC, Dr Montemurro, who has spent years analysing the linguistic patterns within the manuscript, said: 'The text is unique, there are no similar works and all attempts to decode any possible message in the text have failed. 'It's not easy to dismiss the manuscript as simple nonsensical gibberish, as it shows a significant [linguistic] structure.' In an attempt to decode the text, Dr Montemurro used a computerised statistical method  - an approach known to work on other languages. It involved focusing on how the words were arranged. Despite finding semantic patterns within the manuscript, what the words mean still remain a mystery. Breakthrough: Scientists studying the mysterious text say they have found linguistic patterns which they believe could be meaningful words . He admits this still leaves many unanswered questions but insists there must be a story behind the text. Despite making this breakthrough, many are still unconvinced. Academic Gordoni Rugg, from Keele University, says the new findings do not rule out the theory that the manuscript is a hoax. The mystery behind the book has long baffled experts. It has been dated to the early 1400s but disappeared from public record until . 1912. Wilfrid Voynich, an antique book dealer,   bought it . amongst a number of second-hand publications in Italy.

"Nasa's planet-hunting Kepler telescope is broken, potentially jeopardisng the search for other worlds where life could exist outside our solar system. If engineers can't find a fix, the failure could mean an end to the £400 million ($600 million) mission's search - although Nasa says it may still be able to save the ailing telescope. The telescope has discovered scores of planets but only two so far are the best candidates for habitable planets. Kepler is a space observatory launched by Nasa to discover Earth-like planets orbiting other stars. Data from Kepler could help humans find alien life . The Kepler space telescope orbits around the Sun, 40 million miles from Earth. It is named after 17th Century astronomer Johannes Kepler. It was launched in 2009 with the sole purpose of finding new stars and planets. During that time it has confirmed 132 planets and spotted more than 2,700 . potential ones. In December 2011, Kepler found a new Earth-sized planet orbiting a star just 352 light years away. It was found lurking in the Kepler star field and was named Kepler-21b. Its parent star, the HD 179070, is so close it can be . viewed with a home telescope. However, Nasa scientists said there’s very little chance of it hosting life because the surface is a  1627C (2960F). Kepler's mission was supposed to be over by now, but last . year NASA agreed to keep Kepler running through 2016 at a cost of about . £13 million ($20 million) a year. According to Nasa scientists, there is, what's dubbed, a 'Goldilocks Zone' in space where the temperature is not too hot, or too cold, for water to exist in liquid form. Any planets found in this zone could have life on them. If Kepler is retired, Nasa scientists believe the search for other lives on planets could be severely hindered. 'I wouldn't call Kepler down-and-out just yet,' said Nasa sciences chief John Grunsfeld. Nasa said the spacecraft has lost the second of four wheels has stopped working. These four wheels control the craft's orientation in space. With only two working wheels left, it can't point at stars with the same precision. In orbit around the sun, 40 million miles from Earth, Kepler is too far . away to send astronauts on a repair mission, in the same way Grunsfeld and . others fixed a mirror on the Hubble Space Telescope. Over the next several weeks, engineers on the ground will try to restart Kepler's faulty wheel or find a workaround. The telescope could be used for other purposes even if it can no longer track down planets. Kepler was launched in 2009 in search of Earth-like planets. So far, it has confirmed 132 planets and spotted more than 2,700 . potential ones. Its mission was supposed to be over by now but last . year, Nasa agreed to keep Kepler running through 2016 at a cost of about . £13 million ($20 million) a year. Last month, Kepler scientists announced the discovery of two distant planets that scientists believe have the ideal environments to harbour life. This is the space telescope Kepler's field of view, superimposed on the night sky so that the main stars are visible. In its four-year history, Kepler has confirmed 132 planets, and found 2,700 new ones. Some of the discoveries may harbour life . The . other planets found by Kepler haven't fit all the criteria that would . make them right for life of any kind of life - from microbes to man. While ground telescopes can hunt for planets outside our solar system, . Kepler is much more advanced and is the first space mission dedicated to . that goal. For the past four years, Kepler has focused its telescope on a faraway . patch of the Milky Way hosting more than 150,000 stars, recording slight . dips in brightness - a sign of a planet passing in front of the star. Now 'we can't point where we need to point. We can't gather data,' deputy project manager Charles Sobeck told The Associated Press. Scientists said there's a backlog of data that they still need to analyze even if Kepler stopped looking for planets. 'I think the most interesting, exciting discoveries are coming in the . next two years. The mission is not over,' said chief scientist William . Borucki at the Nasa Ames Research Center in Northern California, which . manages the mission. Scientists who have no role in the Kepler mission mourned the news. Nasa engineers preparing the Kepler for launch. The space telescope launched in 2009 with the sole purpose of finding new stars and planets. Its four wheels control its orientation and now two have broken. Deputy project manager Charles Sobeck said because of this fault: 'we can't point where we need to point. We can't gather data' They . said the latest loss means the spacecraft may not be able to determine . how many Earth-size planets are in the 'Goldilocks zone' where it's not . too hot or too cold for water to exist in liquid form on the surface. And while they praised the data collected by Kepler so far, they said . several more years of observations are needed to nail down that number. 'This is one of the saddest days in my life. A crippled Kepler may be . able to do other things, but it cannot do the one thing it was designed . to do.' Alan Boss of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, who is not . part of the Kepler team, said in an email.

"The boom in beekeeping may be doing our countryside more harm than good. For a surge in the number of bumblebee hives means thousands of colonies are being imported. And many of these are riddled with parasites that pose a threat to native species, a study has found. Essential pollinator: But many of the bee colonies currently being imported from the continent are riddled with parasites . With British bees already in peril, scientists say the trade must be tightened up. Commercial gardeners have long kept bumblebees to boost the pollination of their crops. But recently home owners have joined the trend, to do their bit for the environment. As a result, the number of bumblebee colonies imported from the continent each year has soared to between 40,000 and 50,000. However, research from Leeds, Stirling and Sussex Universities found that many of the foreign colonies harbour dangerous bugs. The study of 48 bumblebee colonies . bought from three European suppliers found 77 per cent to be infected. Eight different parasites were found and some colonies contained several . different diseases. Passed . to our native bees, these parasites could deform their wings, leaving . them unable to fly, shorten their life or even kill. Risk: A study of 48 bumblebee colonies bought from three European suppliers found 77 per cent to be infected with parasites . Sussex University researcher William Hughes said: ‘Some of the parasites damage fat stores, many reduce lifespan. They can also affect the ability of the insect to learn and can be lethal.’ One of the bugs found on the bumblebees can be passed to honeybees, where it deforms wings to such an extent the insects cannot fly. Some strains may be new to Britain and there are fears that having high numbers of these bees near plants visited by native insects will speed up the spread of disease. Britain’s bumblebees are already in peril, with intensive farming, changing climate, pollution and disease blamed for two of the 25 native species going extinct and many others struggling to survive. Commercial gardeners use the foreign colonies to boost production of crops such as tomatoes and strawberries in greenhouses and polytunnels. In recent years, home gardeners have also started to buy them and pay up to £100 for a cardboard box of bumblebees to be delivered to their home. The colony, with a queen and up to 100 worker bees, can be used to pollinate lavender and other plants. The researchers, whose study was published in the Journal of Applied Ecology,  want tighter import controls, with bees checked for disease on arrival in the UK. Professor Hughes said: ‘If we don’t act, then the risk is that tens of thousands of parasite-carrying colonies may be imported in the UK each year.’","Number of colonies imported from the continent each year has soared to between 40,000 and 50,000 .

She . was not asked directly about her alleged drug use or her former . personal assistants, Italian sisters Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo, . who were cleared of a £685,000 credit card fraud. During . two days of humiliating evidence at Isleworth Crown Court last month, . Miss Lawson was forced to deny she was a drug addict after confessing to . having snorted cocaine and smoked cannabis. Moving on: Nigella said she had enjoyed a good Christmas on her first TV appearance since the fraud trial of the Grillo sisters, who were eventually found not guilty of fraud . Her . former housekeepers told the court she had let them spend what they . liked in return for keeping her cocaine addiction and heavy cannabis use . a secret from her ‘shouty’ and frightening husband. After the Grillos . were acquitted, Miss Lawson released an extraordinary statement in which . she described the allegations of her drug-taking as a ‘ridiculous . sideshow’. She claimed the . trial had been part of a campaign by her 70-year-old ex-husband to . ‘destroy her’ with malicious and false allegations. She . also complained that her children were subjected to ‘extreme . allegations in court without any real protection,’ something for which . she could not ‘forgive the court process’. Miss . Lawson has long wanted to find fame in America, but the allegations of . drug use during last month’s court case could put those ambitions on . hold. Scotland Yard is to . investigate the cook over her admission that she took cocaine and smoked . cannabis in front of her children. Officers will review the evidence . and then consult the Crown Prosecution Service. She . could face the prospect of being formally interviewed by police. The . first series of The Taste, which involves contestants presenting their . food to the judges over several rounds, will be aired on Channel 4 from . January 7.

In charge: Nigella, pictured alongside her fellow chefs Ludo Lefebrve, Marcus Samuelsson and Anthony Bourdain is both a judge and the show's executive producer . Break: Nigella was with her best friend over Christmas before heading to the United States to promote her new show . Meanwhile it . emerged yesterday that Mr Saatchi spent New Year’s Eve on a £25million . super yacht in the Caribbean with his new girlfriend Trinny Woodall. He . reportedly spent tens of thousands of pounds to hire the 160ft long . vessel, on which he and  Miss Woodall were ‘acting like honeymooners’. One of Miss Lawson’s fellow judges on The Taste, chef Anthony Bourdain, . is a reformed drug addict who once sold his record collection to buy . heroin. Bourdain, 57, wrote a . bestselling memoir of his days as a chef in New York in the 1990s, . describing how ‘we were high all the time, sneaking off to the walk-in . [refrigerator] at every opportunity. Hardly a decision was made without . drugs’. Testimony: Nigella is questioned by . Karina Arden, defending, as sisters Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo . watch from the dock where she said she had taken cocaine seven times . Not guilty: The TV cook accused her ex-husband of a campaign 'deliberately designed to destroy my reputation' as former aides Elisabetta Grillo (left) and Francesca Grillo (right) were cleared of a £680,000 credit card fraud .

"After a few delays and almost 9 years after the last installment, Pikmin 3 charms its way onto the Wii U. But is it a ‘must have’ Nintendo exclusive that will help shift more Wii U consoles? Whilst it’s a title well worth owning, as a potential ‘system seller’ it inadvertently highlights some key flaws with Nintendo and the Wii U. The game sets the scene in a potential not-too-distant future Earth scenario; the world is overpopulated and all food sources have been depleted. Probing vessels are launched out into space to find a planet that could potentially house additional food sources that can be brought back to Earth. Vibrant: there is no denying that Pikmin 3 is one of the Wii U's best-looking titles . Fortunately, one such planet was found and on their entry into its atmosphere, our three characters Alph, Brittney and Captain Charlie become separated. The adventure begins here as the characters have to reunite themselves, find enough food sources to avoid hunger and feed the population back home and find a way to power their ship to get them back home. Thankfully this new world is inhabited by very friendly Pikmin who are happy to help out. In Pikmin 3 players are encouraged to explore their surroundings and discover the best ways to navigate obstacles, whilst utilising the best way to use the various forms of Pikmin available. Each different colour Pikmin has its own ability, red Pikmin withstand fire, black rock Pikmin shatter crystal obstacles, yellow can be thrown high and are immune to electricity, blue are resistant to water and winged Pikmin that can fly. Each different Pikmin type allows for the game to be played in a number of different ways. Previous areas can be re-explored once new Pikmin types are encountered allowing for a good balance in strategy and exploratory gameplay. Players will have to decide which Pikmin to use for which obstacle whilst also attempting to split tasks between the three characters. However, all exploring must be done in daylight hours with all Pikmin returning to their ‘Onion’ (their home), before dark lest the wild beasts catch them. Yet as each day passes more food is consumed by the characters so constant exploration to find food is key during daylight hours. Pikmin are controlled using the Wii U gamepad, which is where one of problems lies. It simply isn’t ideal controlling a crosshair with the Wii U gamepad to whistle commands, throw Pikmin and navigate obstacles. The cursor movement just doesn’t quite lend itself to the game. Charming: despite some control issues, there's plenty here to sink your teeth into . Use a standard Wiimote though and the game plays perfectly, yet as you can’t do this for off-TV play it’s an exercise in futility. The Wii U has often played on its innovation and the capabilities of the system and gamepad. It’s ironic for Nintendo that one of its most anticipated titles could have played better on its previous hardware. That being said Pikmin 3 is still a very fun, charming experience with immersive strategy and exploration elements. There’s plenty to sink teeth into and packs a lot more of a punch than previous Wii U titles. It may not quite save the system, but it’s a worthy addition to the Wii U nonetheless. Pikmin 3 is out now. Let us know what you think on Twitter: @DailyMailGames and on Facebook: Daily Mail Games.","Charming characters and visuals .

"Heartbroken Mindy McCready faces a new custody battle over her eldest son following the suicide death of her boyfriend, MailOnline can reveal today. McCready, her mother Melody Gayle Inge and the boy's father Billy McKnight will all stake their claim to look after five-year-old Zander. The singer's grandmother Gayle told MailOnline today that her daughter was planning to travel to Arkansas to be with her grandson. Mourning: David Wilson, seen here with his country singer girlfriend Mindy McCready, was found with a gunshot wound on Sunday night and pronounced dead hours later . The tragedy is almost certain to reignite a tug-of-love battle that captivated America a little over a year ago after McCready was found hiding in a closet in December 2011 with the boy after kidnapping him from her own mother. 'She doesn't want to talk right now, but she will go to Arkansas,' Gayle said at the home she shares with her daughter in Fort Myers, Florida. 'She will want to be there for him.We will have to see what happens,' she added. Melody was the official legal guardian . of the boy after Mindy's drink and drug problems became so bad that it . meant she could not longer look after the child. Custody: Mindy had been fighting for custody rights over her elder son Zander (pictured) for years and allegedly was just awarded the landmark decision . Mindy's mother Melody, pictured,tried to fight for custody for her grandson but Mindy had just been granted full rights . The boy's father is Mindy's ex, Billy McKnight, pictured here with his son . Zander's father McKnight also had visitation rights to his son and would see him regularly. Friends said he is also expected to travel to Arkansas in the hope of seeing his son. The looming custody battle follows the apparent suicide death of McCready's live-in boyfriend David Wilson. He was found dead at his home in Heber Spring, Arkansas, on Sunday from a self inflicted gunshot wound. McCready,37, issued as statement saying she had lost her 'soul mate'. His death is likely to have a huge bearing on her suitability to look after Zander and his nine-month-old brother Zayne, a child she had with Wilson. Their exact whereabouts is unknown but they are still thought to be in Arkansas. Friends of McCready's estranged mother is also planning to make the trip with family members saying her primary concern is her grandson. Toys belonging to Zander litter the front entrance to the Melody's home. Bygone era: McCready burst onto the country music scene in 1996 with 'Ten Thousand Angels' (left), and she had her first son Zander ten years later in 2006 (right), seen here being held on stage by Rosie O'Donnell . 'Life partners': McCready, 37, and Wilson, 34, lived together in a home owned by a Wilson relative . A mini motorized jeep and two scooters block most of the entrance way to the modest single storey home. There are also several children's bikes propped against the garage. Mrs Inge, 57, was appointed legal guardian by a court in Lee County after Mindy lost custody of Zander in 2007 following drug abuse and battery charges. The singer launched a battle to retain custody of her son but hit the headlines in 2011 when she failed to return the boy to his father's home in Apollo Beach, Florida, following a visit. McKnight filed a missing persons report and a judge ordered McCready to return the child by a specified deadline. She defied the court ruling and it was left to U.S. Marshals to track her and Zander down to Arkansas, at the home of Wilson where they were found hiding in a closet. A court placed the boy in foster care while McCready did not face any charges. Criminal record: Mindy McCready has been arrested multiple times- for a probation violation in 2005 (left), for allegedly assaulting her mother in 2007 (center) and for a probation violation shortly after that (right) In the business: Wilson ran Dave Wilson Productions and was also a songwriter . McCready sensationallly claimed that her son was abused by his grandmother in a bid to stop her from retaining legal guardianship. Since living with 34-year-old Wilson in Arkansas she was able to prove to the court that she was clear of drink and drugs and in February 2012 was granted custody, according to some reports. But neighbors of Mrs Inge said she had not seen her grandson since. 'Melody loved that little boy and I know she will do all she can to get him back,' said one neighbor. 'She has kept all his toys in his room and will want to make the best life for him. 'From what I gather things are still difficult with her daughter. They have not mended their relationship, and I doubt they ever will.' Picturesque: Wilson was found shot in the home he and Mindy shared on Fox Chase Road in Eden Isle neighborhood just off Greers Ferry Lake in Arkansas . Too young: Wilson was only 34-years-old when he was found dead on Sunday, and he was the father of Mindy's 9-month-old son Zayne . Mindy McCready was so in love with David Wilson that she felt she 'finally found the one person that she was supposed to be with', her former lawyer also revealed today to MailOnline. James Moon said: 'I met David a couple of times and he was very protective of Mindy and looked after her very well. 'She was always smiling when she was around him and when she found out she was pregnant she was ecstatic. 'She made a comment to the extent that she felt that she had finally found the one person she was supposed to be with. 'I know David drove her from Arkansas to Florida for one of the child custody meetings which is where I saw him, and on two other occasions. 'I never heard any arguments or any strong words between them'. Mr Moon, who is based in Fort Myers, Florida, represented McCready until she took her son Zander to Arkansas early last year. Now that Mr Wilson is dead, Mr Moon said that he hope the judge in Florida that is responsible for her case does not force her to return to the state. He said: 'She has accomplished so much and I hope the court allows her to continue proving she's a good mum'. Troubled: Mindy McCready, 37, has waged a public battle with drug addiction since her career peaked in 1996 . Meanwhile, an official at Cleburne County Sheriff's department confirmed to MailOnline that police and emergency services responded to a call at approximately 6.15pm on Sunday though it is unclear who made the call. The house is the same one where McCready was discovered hiding in the closet after the nationwide manhunt. Wilson is the father of McCready's younger son, Zayne, who was born in April. 'Today, we mourn the loss of my life partner and my children's father, David Wilson,' McCready said in a statement she released on Monday. 'David was my soulmate; he was a caregiver and guiding hand to our sons, Zander and Zayne. 'He was a precious gift from God to all of us and, yesterday, he returned home and is now with his mother and father. David loved and he was loved. 'Those who knew and loved him will miss him; those who did not know David missed the opportunity to know a truly loving and gifted man.' The police report says that emergency services arrived at Wilson's house on Fox Chase Road at 6.15pm and transported him to nearby Baptist Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 8pm. No criminal charges have been filed but the investigation is ongoing. Speaking to MailOnline, Mindy's brother Joshua said that she was too upset to talk to anybody. He said: 'She's going through a lot right now. What happened was tragic, there's no doubt about it.' Wilson is said to be a record producer and songwriter, though it is unclear who he worked with specifically. McCready rose to fame in 1996 with her hit country song 'Ten Thousand Angels.' Her album of the same name went double platinum - though that marked the peak of her career. She struggled with arrests and drug addition after her career began to faded in the late 1990s. She was dropped by BNA Records in after her 1999 album had disappointing sales and then dropped by Capitol Records in after her 2002 record suffered the same fate. She was arrested in Tennessee in 2004 and pleaded guilty to using a fake prescription to buy the painkiller OxyContin. Hard life: McCready has been arrested numerous times - including once for drunk driving and once for drugs . She . was arrested in Nashville in May 2005 for drunk driving and driving . with a suspended license after she was stopped for speeding. Two months . later, she was charged with identity theft, unlawful use of . transportation, unlawful imprisonment, and hindering prosecution in . Arizona. She was arrested twice, in 2005, 2007 and 2008, for violating the term of her probation. In . 2005 and 2008, she was hospitalized for attempting suicide. She was . taken to the hospital in 2010 for a drug overdose, as well.In July 2007, she was arrested in Fort Myers, Florida and charged with with fighting with her mother. McCready . has been mounting a comeback in recent years, though. Her 2010 album . 'I'm Still Here' was praised by critics for McCready's vocal prowess. She also appeared on Celebrity Rehab with Dr Drew as she attempted to work out her drug issues. On the show's website, VH1 made references to her personal problems and even pegged the root of her troubles on her relationships. Her biography on the show's page says: 'Although she was arrested and jailed for trying to buy OxyContin with a false prescription and attempted suicide with an overdose of drugs and alcohol, Mindy believes her only true addiction is to violent relationships.'","McCready made national headlines when she was found in Wilson's closet after taking her older son, Zander, from her mother, who had custody .

"Detectives in New York are holding a 'person of interest' in the brutal murder of a British football coach who was stabbed to death and had his ear sliced off. Michael Jones, 25, was left in a pool of blood yesterday after the 'frenzied' assault near Union Square, a popular destination for tourists in Lower Manhattan. Police are currently interviewing a man who they believe was captured by security cameras calmly walking away from the spot. Officers said the knifeman slashed his victim’s neck before stabbing him multiple times in his stomach and chest. Scroll down for video . Victim: Football coach Michael Jones, 25, was stabbed numerous times in the savage attack . Mr Jones was from Tarleton, Lancashire. He moved to the US five years ago to pursue his dream of becoming a football coach . A piece of his ear was found on the pavement, and his wounds were so severe police believed they were dealing with a Halloween prank. For the past five years, Mr Jones, of Tarleton, Preston, had been coaching children aged three to 13 with the New York Red Bulls, whose senior team includes former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry and ex-Everton star Tim Cahill. The Liverpool fan had been drinking with his girlfriend on Saturday evening when he left her to meet another friend. He was returning to meet her when at 4.17am he got into an argument with his attacker, who has been described as a Hispanic man aged between 25 and 30, with a dark ponytail. The incident is not thought to have been a robbery as Mr Jones’s iPhone was found at the scene. No arrests have been made and the investigation is ongoing. Chilling CCTV footage shows the pair walking together as they rowed before the brutal assault begins. After the attack, the man is seen calmly walking away. Police watch: Photos of the scene where the British New York Red Bulls coach Michael Jones died . Horror: Witnesses thought it was an early Halloween prank when they saw the body . A police source said: 'It was a . frenzy. The guy was chopped multiple times. He cut the guy’s ear off. It . doesn’t get any more personal than that.' Last night, Mr Jones’s . parents Perry and Carole said their son ‘loved America’ and was . ‘ecstatic’ when he was offered a contract as youth team coach at the . Major League Soccer team, working there for most of the year and . returning to Lancashire in the off-seasons. The family called the police after Michael’s brother Phillip, 23, received an alarming message from his friends in America. 'I contacted the police and I was totally shocked, I was expecting to hear he had been injured in an accident. ‘[The police] told us Mike had been . murdered,’ said Mr Jones’s father, a 50-year-old IT manager. ‘We just cannot believe it. How was I . to tell my wife and son? 'We’re all just devastated. All we know is that . Mike was walking along a street when it happened.’ Shocking: The sidewalk in a bustling area of the West Village in New York City is stained with Mr Jones' blood, marking the spot where he died . Is this the killer? The suspect, seen in this surveillance video, is described as a man between 25-30 with a dark ponytail . His son loved New York and was hoping to get a visa so he could stay there full time, he added. The coach, who lived . outside New York in the city of White Plains, spent much of his spare . time visiting tourist attractions. ‘He said it was amazing to go out on a . Saturday night,’ his parents recalled. ‘He would put our mind at ease . by going on about how safe it was, that you could flag down taxis at any . time and the tubes were so easy to use.’ Jessica Roth, whose son was coached by . Mr Jones, said: ‘He had the patience of a saint with these kids. We’re . devastated. How do you explain to children eight years old what . happened? You can’t, because it’s a senseless crime.’ Before travelling to the US, Mr Jones had completed a sport science and technology degree at Lancashire’s Edge Hill University. House: A general view of British man Michael Jones's home in the Westchester region of New York state . Michael, centre, was described as 'a great guy who would do no-one harm' The vicious attack happened near Union Square in Manhattan . His parents said he had recently become ‘serious’ about a girl called Bryeanna. Mr Jones’s father added: ‘He was . always a very happy lad. He was doing a job that he wanted to do and we . were very proud of him.’ The last time the family saw Mr Jones was three weeks ago, when he returned home to be best man at his best friend’s wedding. A spokesman for the Foreign Office said it was providing consular assistance to Mr Jones’s family. Map: This graphic shows where Michael Jones's body was found in Manhattan, New York . New York Red Bulls said: 'We are aware of this tragedy and on behalf of the entire organization, want to send our most heartfelt condolences to Michael's family, friends and loved ones. 'He was a tremendous individual, a fantastic coach who loved soccer and a terrific friend for many of us. This is truly a sad day for our soccer community and we will do our utmost to help authorities in their investigation of this case. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with Michael's family at this time.' Michael was a former player with Tarleton Corinthians and his former manager Dave Nelson said: 'I feel anger, upset and absolute devastation. You wouldn't want that to happen to anyone. 'Mike was such a nice guy - down to earth, outgoing, funny, always up for some banter but he knew when to be serious, loving and caring.'

"A lawyer for phone-hacking victims in the UK will meet the American attorney representing 9/11 families who fear their phones were also illegally hacked. Mark Lewis, the solicitor representing many celebrities who have won damages against the News of the World in London, is crossing the Atlantic to take the battle to the doorstep of Rupert Murdoch’s media empire. He is planning to launch three civil lawsuits over alleged phone-hacking against News Corp. Victim by association: While Princess Diana (left) may not have had her phone hacked, it is thought that her butler Paul Burrell (right) did . But while in New York Mr Lewis will . also work with Norman Siegel, a lawyer who represents 20 families of . victims of the 2001 outrage. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder . launched an investigation last year after reports that News of the World . journalists had asked a New York private detective to hack their . phones, which he declined to do. Mr Siegel said: ‘At the time we could . not find any evidence anyone I represent was hacked. At this stage I . can’t comment further because I don’t know what will come out of the . meeting.’ Princess Diana’s former butler Paul . Burrell is expected to be one of the trio of individuals due to launch . lawsuits claiming that their phones were hacked while they were on U.S. soil. Mr Lewis said that one of the alleged . victims was connected to Princess Diana and the Royal household whilst a . second is linked to the England football team. The third is described as a ‘Hollywood case’ as the person was in touch with a well-known celebrity which made him a target. In another first, at least once of the cases allegedly involves a phone belonging to a U.S. citizen. Mr Lewis will file civil lawsuits in . America on their behalf ‘imminently’ as all three are claiming that the . criminality took place whilst they were on U.S. soil. Possible victims: An acquaintance of Jude Law's (left) is thought to be one of the people whose phone was hacked at JFK airport, and David Beckham (right) is also allegedly a victim as well . The legal action could open up News . Corp to further embarrassing revelations and bring the scandal to its . headquarters in New York. So far it has been largely confined to the UK. In an interview with The Daily Beast, . Lewis says that all of the numbers which were allegedly hacked were . found in the notebooks of Glenn Mulcaire. He was the private detective formerly . employed by the News of the World, which was owned by News Corp . subsidiary News International before the newspaper was closed down in . July last year. Lewis claims that the individuals . themselves may not have been the only people who were targeted but those . close to them too may have come under scrutiny. Lawsuits: Lawyer Mark Lewis (left) said he will file civil lawsuits against Rupert Murdoch's (right) American branch of News Corp on behalf of his clients as all three claim the hacking took place  on U.S. soil . He told the Daily Beast: ‘This is getting wider. ‘It’s not just the people who were . A-list or celebrities, but people who were in their circles - people who . might call them or work with them, what I would call the ordinary . people who just got caught in the crossfire’. Lewis declined to say which newspaper . carried out the alleged hacking but said he is keen to start requesting . documents through the U.S. courts as soon as possible. He said: ‘We’ve only seen the . documents that exist in respect to News International in England, and . there’s been no process of discovery in respect of News Corp. ‘That could be the next thing that we have to find out.’ Another arm of his legal action could . be a separate lawsuit that examines ‘the dirty tricks that might have . been used in order to further the commercial aims for News Corporation,’ he added. Earlier this month James Murdoch was forced to step down as chairman of BSkyB amid questions over his role in the scandal. The FBI has already reportedly begun . examining claims by the actor Jude Law that his phone was hacked by the . News of the World whilst he was at JFK airport in New York. News Corp declined to comment.","Three lawsuits set to be filed on behalf of unidentified clients, but they are suspected to be David Beckham, a friend of Jude Law's, and Princess Diana's butler Paul Burrell ."
"Facebook is facing another backlash from users and privacy campaigners after announcing it is once again changing its privacy settings. Up until now Facebook let people hide their profiles in search results using the 'Who can look up your timeline by name?' setting, but the social networking site is retiring this feature with almost immediate effect. The option was removed from the accounts . of people who hadn't enabled it last year, and Facebook has . announced it is removing the feature from everyone else's accounts starting . from now. Facebook began removing the 'Who can look up your timeline by name?' feature on accounts which weren't using it last year, but is now retiring it completely. This means users can no longer remove themselves for search results on the site when people who aren't their friends try to find them . Users who still have the old setting will soon see a notice on their homepage warning them the feature is being removed. The best way for users to control . what people can find about them is to choose an 'audience' for each of . the individual things that are shared. In the coming weeks, people who share . posts publicly on Facebook will also see a notice reminding them those . posts can be seen by anyone, including people they may not know. They . will also be given guidance on how to change the audience for each . post. To quickly control who can find previous posts, users can go to Privacy Settings page and click 'Limit the audience of posts you’ve shared in the past'. This means any posts that were previously shared with Friends of Friends . or Public will now be shared just to Friends. Sean Walsh, head of social media and content for Blue Claw told MailOnline: 'In a world where privacy is significant . issue for many users, this is a massive step backwards for . Facebook and may contribute to even more users quitting the site.' Twitter user RisaJoyyy tweeted: 'Just realised @facebook changed privacy settings so anyone can message me. I'm so annoyed with their lack of concern for user privacy/safety. While Nygenxer added the changes highlighted 'yet another privacy setting lost; good news for stalkers. Don't. Use. Facebook.' The 'Who can look up your Timeline by . name?' feature was applied when people searched for someone's profile . using Facebook's search bar. Depending on the setting chosen, the . profile was either completely hidden from everyone who wasn't already a . Facebook friend; could only be seen by friends of friends or was only . visible to certain groups or networks of people. According to Facebook's chief privacy . officer, Michael Richter: 'The setting was created when Facebook was a . simple directory of profiles and it was very limited. 'It didn’t prevent people from . navigating to your Timeline by clicking your name in a story in News . Feed, or from a mutual friend’s Timeline.' He added that following the launch of . Facebook's Graph Search last year, which lets people find more specific . details about site members, it's important for users to be able to . control the privacy of the information shared, rather than how people . get to their timeline. According to Facebook's chief privacy officer, Michael Richter, the setting was created when Facebook was a simple directory of profiles. Following the launch of Facebook's Graph Search last year, pictured, the site now wants users to take control over the individual pieces of personal data they share, not just their overall profile . With Graph Search, people can now search for 'users that like rock music in Seattle', for example, or 'vegetarians in Swansea.' Facebook . ultimately wants people to take greater control over the individual . pieces of personal data they share on the site, not just the overall . profile. According to Walsh: 'The launch of Graph Search Facebook is no longer content with being 'just a social network' and wants to rival the likes of Google and Bing in the search . market. 'The difference for Facebook is that whilst Google and Bing have a . plethora of website data, Facebook has the majority of real-use . information. 'It knows where you went on holiday, who your past . relationships were with, even what brands and TV shows you like. By making this . data more accessible and removing privacy barriers, Facebook can make . Graph Search more attractive to potential advertisers.' Nick McAleenan, a media law expert from JMW Solicitors continued: 'Facebook is clearly trying to close a privacy loophole as people are increasingly aware of their privacy rights. However, the trend we are seeing is actually for people to share more and more info about themselves - Twitter being perhaps the best example of this.' Jim Brock, ‎vice president of privacy products at AVG Technologies told MailOnline: 'Keeping up with Facebook's constantly changing privacy framework and policies is beyond most people. 'Facebook's business objective is to make information as widely available as possible for commercial purposes, which for many people conflicts with the desire to share mostly with only close family and friends. 'Facebook clings to the myth that they aren't changing the privacy framework when they make our profiles and activity more easily searched and indexed. The fact is, Facebook's default rules make my profile available to more than a billion other people, so when they make it easier to find and search, they are changing the balance of privacy and people should understand this.'","Facebook is retiring the 'Who can look up your timeline by name?' setting .

"An auction house is providing a rare opportunity to buy a 500-year-old piece of natural history by selling bones from a dodo bird for the first time in 80 years. The leg and pelvis from the flightless bird, which died out in the mid-17th century, represent the first opportunity to purchase a complete part of the animal's skeleton since 1934. The anonymous vendor is believed to be one of only three people left in the world who privately own dodo bones, with most now on display in museums. Rare opportunity: The leg (left) and pelvis bone (right) from the extinct dodo are the first on sale since 1934 . The pair were part of a large collection of remains discovered by a British schoolmaster 220 years after the bird became extinct. In 1886 George Clarke went to Mauritius, the only place the dodo is said to have lived, and hired slaves to wade through a swamp and feel for the bones with their feet. The leg and pelvis, which are being sold by Summers Place Auctions of Billingshurst in West Sussex, are said to be worth more than £30,000 together and are both in excellent states of preservation. Earlier this year, a fragment of a femur was sold for £8,000 by auction house Christie's in London. Dodos were first spotted by Dutch sailors who arrived on the Indian Ocean isle in 1598, but the final sighting was only 64 years later in 1662. Sparse: A replica skeleton of a dodo. Only 10 museums around the world are set to have sets of dodo bones, but most are composites . While it is thought they were hunted to extinction by humans, another belief is that macaque monkeys plundered dodo nests after being introduced on Mauritius. Errol Fuller, a natural history expert and curator for the auction, said: 'Most dodo bones that exist today were found in a swamp in Mauritius by George Clarke. 'The remains went to museums and private collectors but over the years they have gradually gravitated to museums. 'Only about 10 museums in the world have a complete dodo skeleton and most of them are composites. 'Physical remains of the bird in private hands today hardly exist. There are only two or three people in the world privately who have dodo bones. Drawing: The dodo (or Raphus cucullatus) was first spotted by Dutch sailors who arrived on Mauritius in 1598 . 'The last complete dodo bone was sold in 1934 in London. There will be a lot of interest in these two items. There are dodo fans all over the world and there are lots of them. Around 200 years after they had died out, dodo birds started to gain a mythical status due to Victorian author Lewis Carroll. He was inspired to write the creature into Alice's Adventures in Wonderland after seeing the head of one at a museum in Oxford. Mr Fuller added: 'The dodo was so extreme looking yet nobody really took much notice of them until the 1860s when Lewis Carroll wrote about one in Alice in Wonderland. 'That generated an interest in the bird that has never ceased. If you go to Mauritius today you can by souvenir dodo T-shirts and ashtrays. 'And of course the dodo is regarded as a symbol of extinction, mainly due to the saying 'dead as a dodo.'","Leg and pelvis of bird which died out in the mid-17th century up for sale .

"This grand 18th century estate, which comes with eight bedrooms, five bathrooms and stables, has gone on the market for £1million - less than some flats in central London. Newsham Grange, a Grade-II listed manor near Northallerton, North Yorkshire, was built in 1705 and is set in 16-acre grounds. The Queen Anne country house, which looks like something out of a period drama, is just a two-hour train from the capital - but is available for less than some far smaller London flats. Scroll down for video . Newsham Grange, an 18th century eight-bedroom, five-bathroom estate near Northallerton, North Yorkshire, was built in 1705 and is set in 16-acre grounds . The Queen Anne country house is just a two-hour train from the capital - but is available for less than some far smaller flats in the most sought-after parts of London . Something out of Downton: The kitchen, complete with an AGA cooker, looks like something from a period drama - apart from the inconspicuous microwave . The estate is expected to sell for around £1million at auction later this month - which is less than some two-bedroom flat in the most desirable parts of the capital . The magnificent house, owned by semi-retired financial consultant Rob Edenbrow, 65, and his wife, Lesley, 55, comes with  views of the North Yorkshire countryside . Owner of the magnificent house Rob Edenbrow, a 65-year-old semi-retired financial consultant, has lived in the house with wife Lesley, 55, and daughter Ellen, 19, for the past 15 years. However, due to Mr Edenbrow's poor health, the family have decided to downsize from their country home, which has a long private drive and comes complete with equestrian facilities, to an apartment. The entire contents of the estate are expected to sell for around £1million at auction - which is less than a posh one/two-bedroom flat in the most desirable parts of London. Mr Edenbrow, who grew up in a council house in Scunthorpe, said: 'We turned it from a livery into a family house for ourselves. We wanted the open space and I can see 22 miles to the hills but I am only three miles from the station. 'It is just over two hours to London Kings Cross and a neighbour actually commutes to London. When you look at this compared to a one-bed flat in London it is almost silly. 'It is not remote, but you have plenty of space. The main house has only got three bedrooms but they are massive and there is a two-bedroom guest house and three-bedroom barn conversion. 'There is also office space, equestrian facilities and 14 stables, although we have never kept any horses here. 'We wanted a project and we got one. We have been very fortunate to live here and have really enjoyed our time. It is absolutely beautiful around here and would suit anybody. 'It would be perfect for a family who still have their parents around, or someone looking for an extra income from holiday lets.' The Edenbrows, who have lived in the grand house with their 19-year-old daughter, Ellen, are selling up because of a decline in Mr Edenbrow's health . The main house has only got three bedrooms, but the estate comes with another two-bedroom guest house and a three-bedroom barn conversion . The £1million asking price buys the manor, converted barn, guest house, stables, 16 acres of land and planning permission for two further cottages . Mr Edenbrow said the estate would be 'perfect for a family who still have their parents around, or someone looking for an extra income from holiday lets' The mini estate will go under the hammer in three weeks' time with Hunters Auction House, which is holding what will be a hotly-contested auction at York Racecourse . John Waterhouse, Hunters director and auctioneer, said buyers coming from London would be 'surprised to see what their money can get them' Newsham Grange boasts the main house, which has 2,532 sq/ft of accommodation, the three bed barn conversion and two bed granary. In total, there are eight bedrooms, five bathrooms and planning permission for a further two bedrooms with en suites in the main house. The mini estate will go under the hammer on September 24 with Hunters Auction House, which is holding the sale at York Racecourse. John Waterhouse, Hunters director and auctioneer, said: 'Newsham Grange is a rare country estate located in one of the most sought after areas of Yorkshire. 'The estate provides the ideal opportunity for a buyer looking to leave the hustle and bustle of city life to escape to the country. 'In doing so, many buyers coming from London will be surprised to see what their money can get them. It is outstanding that this country pile is available at the same price as a two bedroom flat in prime central London. 'What's more, the estate also has the potential for income with its two additional properties and planning consent for an additional holiday cottage.' Owners Mr and Mrs Edenbrow are planning to downsize to a much smaller apartment, but say they thoroughly enjoyed living in their very own manor house . The converted barn on the 18th-century Newsham Grange has a side entrance which branches off the estate's long, gravel driveway - keeping it secluded from the road . The estate is an 'ideal opportunity for a buyer looking to leave the hustle and bustle' of inner-city life, the auctioneers say, but is still just three-miles from a train station . The Edenbrow's home is expected to sell for up to £1.2million. For that money in the most sought-after areas of London, buyers could snap up a two-bedroom flat, such as the ones below. 1) This luxury two-bed flat in Hampstead, north-west London, has a spacious open-plan living room, and is on the market for £1million. The large living room, brightly lit up by a large window, is perfect for a young family. 2) This two-bed flat, which lies right next to Regent's Park and is around 100 yards from Baker Street underground station, will set a buyer back £1,149,950. The wooden-floored apartment, which has two bathrooms, is just a short walk from Oxford Street. Its kitchen has a marble worktop and fashionable converted fireplace. 3) A flat in this building in trendy Swiss Cottage, in Camden, will set you back £1million. It has two large bathrooms and double bedrooms, and is wooden-floored throughout and has a feature gas fireplace. Its lounge, easily large enough for a family, fits two sofas as well as a large dining table. 4) One flat in this red brick block is on the market for £1million, but it does come with an underground parking space and a porter. The home, on Finchley Road, near Swiss Cottage, has three balconies over the seventh and eighth floor. While the building itself looks nothing special, the wooden interior and prime location push up its asking price.","Newsham Grange, an 18th century estate with eight bedrooms and five bathrooms, is on the market for £1million .

"In 1890, Queen Victoria was on the throne, Preston North End won the Football League, and Mrs Spicer laid the foundation stone of the the James Spicer Memorial Church Hall School, in Chingford, north-east London. But after years of its congregation dropping, it closed and was bought by a Brazilian interior designer, Gianna Camilotti, and, as these incredible pictures show, was turned into an astounding home and office. Ms Camilotti, who was raised in Italy, converted the Grade II listed church after falling in 'love at first sight' with the building. Brazilian interior designer Gianna Camolotti bought the The James Spicer Memorial Church Hall School, in Chingford, north-east London off a builder in 2013 . Ms Camolotti, who was raised in Italy, says she fell in 'love at first sight' with the 124-year-old church, which served as a school and meeting place for decades . Using her skills as an interior designer, she transformed the Grade II listed church building into a luxurious home and office, fitting her bedroom with an arched mirror . Better than an organ: The piano in Ms Camolotti's decadent , open plan living room has a self-playing function so she has some company while she works . When she first visited the church it was in a worn-out state. But Ms Camilotti she saw the potential the gothic building, which still had its original curved oak beams, vaulted shaped doors and elegant tall windows from when it was built in the 19th century. She installed contemporary furniture and lighting by Italian designers, plus some items, such as the large sofa in the lounge, cushions and dining table, which she designed herself. Speaking of the first time she saw the church, the interior designer said: 'I'd been searching for a house of my own for months and here it was. Love at first sight. It was magic. 'From the start I had in mind a house that shouldn't only be beautiful, but the perfect place to work and have fun. 'In a way, it's the same sensation I've experienced throwing colours onto a white canvas. In this case, the church was my white canvas because when I arrived it was just the floor, walls, a tall ceiling and nothing else.' The long L-shaped sofa in her huge living room is perfect for relaxing in the evening, and the TV lies in front of the building's 19th century arched windows . Ms Camolotti converted the church but kept some of the features, such as the windows seen here, juxtaposed against the glass panel see-through walls by a bedroom . Walking downstairs, Ms Camolotti comes out into the open plan living space which includes a modern kitchen. The grand wooden beams can be seen on the top floor . Speaking of the first time she saw the church, the interior designer said: 'I'd been searching for a house of my own for months and here it was. It was magic.' The long table, which Ms Camilotti works from, can be turned into a dining table which seats 12 - perfect for hosting friends for a dinner party or piano session . After months of restoration the former church school was finally ready as luxury home. The bathroom, lit by a dozen candles, looks like it should be in a classy hotel . After months of restoration, the former church school, where children had been taught the three Rs and the organ thundered out the hymns of John Wesley, was finally ready as modern, luxury home. The house is kitted out with a self-play piano, to give Ms Camilotti some entertainment while she works, a long L-shaped sofa and a large TV, which sits in front of the arch windows that remain from the old church. Also installed is an extra long table for work which, when necessary, becomes an elegant dining table that seats 12. Because the church, like many, is quite dingy, Ms Camilotti has filled the rooms with concealed lighting and spotlights. The church requires 106 lights, including 15 placed outside in the garden, which glows red in the evening. Flowering shrubs are set against the brickwork which is now clean from the grime of smoky chimneys. The building's ceiling is nine metres high, and 11 when the loft is included, but Ms Camilotti, who has restored churches in the past, says the ceiling is lower than usual. The bedroom, complete with tiger print pillows and throw, looks onto the living area from nearly nine metres above, and still has the wooden beams from the original build . The garden, is lit by 15 strategically placed concealed light bulbs, and looks like the perfect place for a glass of wine after a long day of work in the grand office . Ms Camilotti said she was inspired by her travels to France, as well as remote places in Italy. She added that she was going for 'a Mediterranean atmosphere' Flowering shrubs are set against the brickwork which is now clean from the grime of smoky chimneys. At night, red lighting brightens the Ms Camilotti's relaxation spot . Ms Camilotti said: 'I am so pleased with the way it looks. I have never owned a property with low ceilings, but I must admit, this was a challenge. And I've always loved a challenge. 'I named the house 'Everybody' because it can accommodate up to 18 people. And, it looks impressive' 'From the start I had in mind a house open to friends, to enjoy cosy dinners and karaoke parties that had an atmosphere of London piano-bars and I think I have achieved it.' Speaking of the garden, she says: 'I was inspired by memories of travels to France as well as remote places in Amalfi, Italy with its lavender in flower, olive trees and bistro-style chairs - in other words, a Mediterranean atmosphere.' To preserve the late Victorian origin of the building, the weathered foundation stone is still in place, declaring that is was a Mrs Spicer who officiated on behalf of her late husband on a cold January day in 1890. 'She would probably have blinked seeing the colour and softness compared to her world of Victorian drabness.' Ms Camilotti said. Every year around thirty church buildings in the UK fall into disuse. Falling attendances, changing social patterns and merging of parishes, all contribute to the widespread closures. Many are declared redundant, no longer required for regular public worship, but some re-emerge as art galleries, coffee shops and places of work. The interior designer kept the original foundation stone, laid on a cold January morning by a Mrs Spicer - widow of James Spicer who the church hall was named after . This picture, dating from 1910 when Edward VII was on the throne, shows what the congregational church and hall looked like 20 years after it was built . The church, like 30 others every year, fell into disuese. Some are turned into coffee shops, art galleries or officers. This one was turned into a luxurious, modern house .

"Iran has sent a second live monkey into space and safely returned him to Earth, the country's state-run news agency reports. Fargam the space monkey rode a Pajonesh rocket 75 miles up into space before his capsule safely detached and parachuted back to the ground, Iranian state TV said. The report, which showed the rocket blasting off and then showed the monkey, strapped snugly into a seat, staring at people clapping to celebrate its safe return, added that the launch was Iran's first use of liquid fuel. All hail Fargam the space monkey! Fargam is held . aloft by cheering crowds of Iranian scientists after he today became . the second monkey the country has successfully launched into space and . safely returned to Earth . We have lift off: Fargam - whose name means . 'auspicious' in Farsi - rode a Pajonesh rocket 75 miles up into space . before his capsule safely detached and parachuted back to the ground, . Iranian state TV said . Iran frequently claims technological . breakthroughs that are impossible to independently verify. The Islamic . Republic has said it seeks to send an astronaut into space as part of an . ambitious aerospace programme. 'The . launch of Pajohesh is another long step getting the Islamic Republic of . Iran closer to sending a man into space,' the official IRNA news agency . said. It added: . 'President Hassan Rouhani ... congratulated Iranian scientists and . experts on successfully sending a second living creature into space.' Scientists were able to monitor and measure signals coming from the rocket, including Fargam’s vital signs, during the flight, according to reports. Iran said that it sent its first monkey into space in January, reaching the same height of 75 miles. For Iran, its aerospace programme is a source of national pride. It’s also one of the pillars of Iran’s aspirations to be seen as the technological hub for Islamic and developing countries. Mr Rouhani used Twitter to mark the latest event, a demonstration of rocket power that is likely to cause concern in the West and among some Gulf states, which are worried about Iran's nuclear ambitions. He said the monkey was named Fargam - Farsi for 'auspicious' - and had been returned to earth 'safe and sound'. 'In total, this is the second monkey sent into space and returned in perfect health to Iran,' Rouhani said in another Twitter message. In the January mission, one of two official packages of photos of the simian space traveller depicted the wrong monkey, causing some international observers to wonder whether the monkey had died in space or that the launch didn’t go well. But Iranian officials later said one set of pictures showed an archive photo of one of the alternate monkeys. They said three to five monkeys are simultaneously tested for such a flight and two or three are chosen for the launch. Finally, the one that is best suited for the mission and isn’t stressed is chosen for the voyage. Mission accomplished: Proud scientists . clamour to get in the shot as a news reporter for Iranian television . announces the achievement on air today. For Iran, its aerospace . programme is a source of national pride . The Islamic Republic has not revealed where the rocket launch took place, but it has a major satellite launch complex near Semnan, about 200 km east of Tehran. Iran says it wants to put its own satellites into orbit to monitor natural disasters in the earthquake-prone nation, improve telecommunications and expand military surveillance of the region. Western nations fear that long-range ballistic technology used to propel Iranian satellites into orbit could be put to use dispatching nuclear warheads to a target. Iran's Gulf Arab neighbours view Iran missile capabilities as a threat. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have spent heavily in the past few years on advanced U.S.-made missile defence systems. Iran's efforts to develop and test ballistic missiles and build a space launch capability have contributed to Israeli calls for pre-emptive strikes on Iranian nuclear sites and billions of dollars of U.S. ballistic missile defence spending. In November, the world's six powers made a breakthrough deal for Tehran to curb its nuclear programme in return for limited sanctions easing. The agreement appeared to face its first major difficulty on Friday with Russia warning that expanding a U.S. sanctions blacklist could seriously complicate the deal's implementation. The Islamic Republic denies seeking weapons capability and says it seeks only electricity from its uranium enrichment so it can export more of its considerable oil wealth.","Fargam rode a rocket 75 miles into space before parachuting to Earth .

"A fridge-sized asteroid has crashed into the Moon, in the largest lunar collision with a space rock ever captured on video. Incredible video footage has emerged of the spectacular fireball created as the asteroid impacted the Mare Nubium, a lava-filled basin on the moon. Spanish astronomer Jose Maria Madiedo, a Professor at the University of Huelva, Britain's Royal Astronomical Society, witnessed the incident on September 11 last year, according to AFP reports. Scroll down for video . Collision course: Animated graphic depicts asteroid hurtling towards moon at 61,000 kilometres an hour . Destructive path: Computer-generated graphic reveals the scale of the 400 kilogram asteroid before it collided with the moon . Lunar landscape: A digital graphic shows the large craters created on the surface of the moon as a result of asteroid collisions . He spotted the bright flash while operating two telescopes. At one stage, the flare was almost as bright as the Northern Hemisphere's Pole Star, according to the RAS. The flash would have been visible to the naked eye for anyone who was looking at the Moon at that moment in clear viewing conditions, the RAS said. After the impact there was an afterglow that lasted a further eight seconds, which was the longest and brightest incident of its kind ever recorded. See more videos at Jose Maria Madiedo's YouTube channel . Flashing light: Footage shows the moment asteroid hits the Mare Nubium, a lava-filled basin on the moon . Bright flare: Footage shows afterglow following the impact that lasts for eight seconds . 'At that moment, I realised that I had seen a very rare and extraordinary event,' Madiedo told the RAS. Two videos have captured the event, including one which features actual footage and another that was posted by the researchers, which includes computer-generated graphics that explain the event in great detail. Madiedo's team estimate the asteroid hit the moon at about 61,000 kilometres an hour. It was so fast,the rock turned to molten and vaporised, creating the flash and a crater 40 metres in diametre. The impact energy was equivalent to an explosion of around 15 tonnes of TNT, more than triple the largest previously seen event, claimed by NASA in March 2013. As a measure of comparison, the asteroid that hit Chelyabinsk, Russia, in February last year, is believed to have been about 20 metres wide, weighing 13,000 tonnes. It is considered to have been at the lower end of medium-sized asteroids. Madiedo and colleagues estimate the rock had a mass of around 400 kilograms, with a diameter of between 60 centimetres and 1.4 metres. The team  of researchers estimate that asteroids of this size may strike Earth about 10 times more frequently than was initially thought. However Earth is protected by its atmosphere and asteroids of this size burned up as meteors. The Spanish observation is published in the RAS journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.","Spanish astronomer films asteroid hitting the moon .

"Emoticons such as smiley and sad faces are changing the way our brain works, Australian researchers have claimed. They say the use of the punctuation faces trigger parts of the brain usually reserved for looking at real faces. They believe this may be the key to their popularity - as we process them as a real face. Researchers found that our brains adapt so that we process emoticons as if they were a real face . :P I am sticking out my tongue :^P I am sticking out tongue, and I have a nose B^P I am sticking out tongue, and I have sunglasses:{ I am having a hard time ;-) Winking at you :-D I am laughing happily @}->-- Rose for you (to show affection) |^o I am snoring >:-( I am annoyed . 'Emoticons are a new form of language that we're producing,"" Dr Owen Churches of the school of psychology at Flinders University in Adelaide told ABC News. 'And to decode that language we've produced a new pattern of brain activity.' The researchers say that we pay more attention to faces than most other things we see as we try to 'read' them for emotion. The team wanted to see if this was the case with emoticons. The team showed 20 participants images of real faces, smiley face . emoticons (involving the use of a colon, hyphen and parenthesis), and a . meaningless string of characters. They used electrophysiology to . determine the pattern of electrical activity in the brain when the . participants viewed the different images, and found we react to . emoticons ion the same way. Emoticons have become massively popular, being used in text message and online conversations, along with art projects such as this Banksy Exhibit . The researchers admit the were stunned by the results. 'There is no innate neural response to emoticons that babies are born with. 'Before 1982 there would be no reason that ':-)' would activate face sensitive areas of the cortex but now it does because we've learnt that this represents a face,"" said Churches. 'This is an entirely culturally-created neural response. It's really quite amazing.' One of the earliest appearances of the emoticon appears in an 1862 transcript of a speech by President Abraham Lincoln. The transcript records the audience's response to Lincoln's droll introduction as ""(applause and laughter ;)."" However, the modern usage began when a joke about a fake mercury spill at Carnegie Mellon University was posted online and mistake for a genuine warning. Following a debate,on Sept. 19, 1982, faculty member Scott E. Fahlman entered the debate with the following message: . I propose that [sic] the following character sequence for joke markers::-)Read it sideways. Actually, it is probably more economical to mark things that are NOT jokes, given current trends. For this, use::-( . Seperately the yellow smiley face symbol pre-dates and was developed independent;y, although the two have now merged in many people';s minds.

"Many people feel more comfortable revealing their true feelings, hopes and stresses to a partner after sex and now one researcher thinks she knows why. Amanda Denes believes pillow talk is an undervalued ingredient in a satisfying and enduring relationship and is linked to the production of the 'trust hormone' called oxytocin, which is released after orgasm. She found that women who . orgasmed disclosed more intimate feelings to their partner after sex than women who did not orgasm, which increased the emotional bond between couples. Amanda Denes believes post-sex pillow talk can influence relationship satisfaction just as much as other factors, such as the frequency and satisfaction of sex itself . The Assistant Professor in the Department of Communication at the University of Connecticut, became interested in investigating the role of pillow talk in relationships as people have such different experiences of it. Many people said they open up about their feelings to a partner after sex regardless of the length of a relationship – a time period described as the post-coital time interval (PCTI) by researchers Daniel Kruger and Susan Hughes. ‘Why were some people sharing their innermost feelings, even when they knew the relationship had not yet reached that level? What effects would these post-coital disclosures have on relationship satisfaction?’ Professor Denes wrote in an article for the university. To explore the relationship between hormones and communication decisions, she looked at what people talked about during PCTI as well as ‘one important variable [that] was likely influencing this whole process – orgasm.’ ‘To ignore the importance of orgasm would be to ignore a key piece of the pillow-talk puzzle ,’ she said. Both men and women experience a post-climax oxytocin surge but testosterone is believed to dampen the effects so that men typically fell less warm and fuzzy after sex. A polarised view of crystals of Oxytocin is pictured . When individuals experience orgasm, physiological changes occur as a hormone called oxytocin floods their bodies. Increases in this ‘trust hormone’ have been linked to many socially beneficial behaviours. Both men and women experience a post-climax oxytocin surge but testosterone is believed to dampen the effects so that men typically fell less warm and fuzzy after sex. Professor Denes found that women who orgasmed disclosed more intimate feelings to their partner after sexual activity than women who did not orgasm. Professor Denes found that women who orgasmed disclosed more intimate feelings to their partner after sexual activity than women who did not orgasm . Professor Denes believes that oxytocin is the reason why, as women who climax have more of the hormone in their systems, which increases feelings of trust and connection, than women who did not, influencing individuals’ decisions to talk about their feelings to their partners. She explained that women may talk more about their feelings after sex than men as men’s higher levels of testosterone suppresses the oxytocin response. Individuals in a committed relationship perhaps unsurprisingly disclosed more intimate feelings to their partners after sex than those in newer or more short-term relationships, Professor Denes said. A previous study found that the afterglow of an orgasm minimises the risks and increases the benefits of disclosing personal information. Scientists have found that women whose partners finish off a night of passion by immediately turning over and nodding off are left feeling insecure and craving affection. Psychologists at the University of Michigan said cuddling and talking after sex is a crucial way for a couple to express their commitment to each other, in a study published last January. In relationship terms, they said it could be just as important as what happens before sex, or even the act itself. They questioned 456 heterosexual people who completed online surveys about their sleep patterns with their partner. Lead author Dr Daniel Kruger said they found the participants’ desire for emotional bonding, affection and communication was greatest when their partner fell asleep first. This was found in both men and women but a wealth of previous studies have shown men invariably fall asleep first. Dr Kruger said: ‘When their partner feel asleep first, they craved that bonding time, for expressions of affection and endearment and felt it was lacking. ‘A woman could be pregnant. Although with contraception that may not be the case anymore, we still have this psychology, and the post-coital time is when the couple makes promises to each other and establish commitment. ‘The time couples spend together after sex might be as important as what happens before it in terms of building the relationship yet it has rarely been studied.’","Researcher at the University of Connecticut, examined link between amount of oxytocin in a person's body and communication after sex .

"Raiding the cupboards for food is a well-known effect of smoking cannabis. But for years, scientists have been unable to understand why cannabis’ active ingredient, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), causes such a powerful surge in appetite. Now a European study has revealed that people get ‘the munchies’ after using marijuana because their sense of smell and taste is heightened. A European study has revealed that people get 'the munchies' after using marijuana because their sense of smell and taste is heightened . Scientists claim the findings could be used to develop treatments that better tackle obesity and loss of appetite, according to a report in the New Scientist. A group of neuroscientists, led by Giovanni Marsicano of the University of Bordeaux, found that in mice, THC fits into receptors in the brain's olfactory bulb. This dramatically increases the creature’s ability to smell food and leading them to eat more of it, they said in a study published in Nature Neuroscience. THC, the active ingredient of cannabis, fits into receptors in the brain's olfactory bulb.The olfactory bulbs are shown here in light green.

"There are still hundreds of thousands of new cases of leprosy across the globe every year. Here, a man in Uganda suffers from the disease . Leprosy has plagued mankind throughout history, but is far, far older than stories about the disease in the Bible, according to scientists. A new study claims the disease is probably the oldest infectious disease in humans with roots stretching back millions of years. A scientist at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Centre in Houston found that two leprosy-causing bacteria came from a last common bacterial ancestor around 10 million years ago and that ancient humans and hominids suffered from the disease. There are still hundreds of thousands of new cases of leprosy across the globe every year, which attacks a sufferer’s skin and nerves. If left untreated it can lead to disabilities and even death. In 2008 pathologist Xiang-Yang Han discovered a new leprosy bacteria and since then has analysed 20 genes of Mycobacterium lepromatosis and the better known Mycobacterium leprae bacteria. His team found that the two bacteria came from a last common ancestor around 10 million years ago, according to the study in the journal PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Before this point it is thought that the common bacteria ancestor underwent a massive reductive evolution that resulted in inactivation of approximately 40 per cent of all the genes in its genome. Together with Francisco Silva, of the University of Valencia’s Evolutionary Genetics Unit, Professor Han said that leprosy is a strict human disease that stretches back millions of years. They came up with the theory based upon a number of pieces of evidence. Researchers at the University of Texas in Houston found that two leprosy-causing bacteria, including Mycobacterium leprae (pictured) were pinpointed to come from a last common bacterial ancestor around 10 million years ago, meaning that ancient humans and hominids suffered from the disease . Leprosy is an infectious disease that causes severe, disfiguring skin sores and nerve damage in the arms and legs. The disease has been around since the beginning of time, often surrounded by frightening, negative stigma and tales of leprosy patients being shunned as outcasts. At one time or another, outbreaks of leprosy have affected people on every continent, according to NHS Choices. The oldest civilisations of China, Egypt and India feared leprosy was an incurable, mutilating and contagious disease. However, leprosy is surprisingly not highly contagious. It can only be caught by coming into close contact with nose and mouth droplets from someone with untreated, severe leprosy. Although rarely seen in the UK, the World Health Organisation says more than 200,000 people worldwide are infected with leprosy - most of them in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Leprosy bacteria cannot live outside the human body - with the rare exception of wild armadillos thought to have been infected by American explorers a few hundred years ago. Over 400 strains of Mycobacterium leprae analysed so far have been found to have virtually identical genomes, suggesting that human beings carried the leprosy bacteria when departing Africa around 100,000 years ago to populate the rest of the world. This means that leprosy bacteria are extraordinarily stable within their human hosts - a sign of mature parasitic life far older than 100,000 years. The oldest age of the leprosy bacteria’s pseudogenes suggest that gene inactivation began approximately 20 million years ago, which is probably the point when the ancestor of leprosy bacteria jumped to our early human ancestors and transitioned from free-living to strictly parasitic. The duo’s hypothesis that leprosy existed for millions of years offers new insights into disease pathogenesis. The parasitic adaptation of the leprosy bacteria inside hominid-human hosts is similar to a very long hide-and-seek game. Over 400 strains of Mycobacterium leprae analysed so far have been found to have virtually identical genomes, suggesting that human beings carried the bacteria when departing Africa 100,000 years ago to populate the rest of the world. The disease features in several biblical stories and a painting by James Tissot is pictured . The parasite would have hidden by mutating or removing harmful molecules while retaining protective ones, which in the end lead to evasion from host immunity - a phenomenon commonly seen in leprosy. Professors Han and Silva concluded that leprosy can be viewed as a natural consequence of a long parasitism. Professor Han said: Discovering the new leprosy agent Mycobacterium lepromatosis was incidental. However, locating this additional leprosy cause significantly adds to our understanding of the ancient disease. ‘In particular, tracing the ultimate origin of leprosy through the parasitic adaptive evolution of the leprosy bacteria is rather insightful, not only for this single disease but also for our better understanding of the mechanism behind other human infections.'","A University of Texas Houston study found two leprosy-causing bacteria came from a common bacterial ancestor around 10 million years ago .

"Landing a delicate rover on a hostile planet can be tricky at the best of times. But what if you could bounce the rover on the surface, in a similar way to dropping a ball, without having to worry about damage? That’s what Vytas SunSpiral and Adrian Agogino at Nasa Ames Research Center are attempting to find out through their design of a shape-shifting robotic exoskeleton, dubbed the Super Ball Bot. Scroll down for video... Nasa is designing a flexible, deformable robotic exoskeleton to land on alien planets. This spherical structure might be able to land without assistance, absorbing most of the shock of impact itself . The Super Ball Bot’s spherical structure can land without any help, absorbing the shock of impact and saving weight that would otherwise be taken up by parachutes and impact balloons. It can also use its ball-like structure to roll around without wheels once on the surface, propelling itself forward by shortening and lengthening the cables that connect its rigid components. These same cables can be used to pull back parts of the robot, so that science instruments at the centre may be exposed and used. A concept drawing of the mission, where many Super Ball Bots could be deployed and bounce to a landing before moving and exploring the surface . The robot could be collapsed to a very compact configuration for launch. Once it reaches Titan, it would open and drop to the surface. The Super Ball Bot’s spherical . structure can land without any help, absorbing most of the shock of . impact and saving weight needed for more complex landing gear. It can use this same ball-like structure to roll around . without wheels, propelling itself forward by shortening and lengthening the cables that connect its rigid components. These same cables could be used to pull back parts of the robot, so that science instruments at the centre could be used. The design is a radical departure from the rovers currently in service, such as Curiosity, which use more traditional rigid robots. The Super Ball Bot, however, relies on something known as ‘tensegrity’ which means it’s composed entirely of interlocking rods and cables. Nasa describes tensegrities as counter-intuitive tension structures with no rigid connections but which are ‘uniquely robust, light-weight, and deployable’. There is no single point of failure in a tensegrity robot and no axles or hinges have to be strengthened. Instead, the force of an impact is diffused over multiple areas on the robot. These unusual structures are hard to control traditionally so researchers are experimenting with controlling them using machine learning algorithms and neuroscience inspired controls known as ‘Central Pattern Generators’. Mr Agogino told Rachel Courtlands of IEEE Spectrum that that they'd have to invent new ways to handle controls so the robot will move smoothly and efficiently. ‘This is so new that if you can do anything more than a twitching dead thing you’re really ahead of the curve,’ he said. The design could be used for a potential mission to Saturn's moon Titan. Swince the robot collapses into a smaller shape, scientists could pack a number of units into one spacecraft and study more of the moon's surface. The space agency believes a Super Ball Bot could fall from more than 62 miles above Titan without being damaged. Any interplanetary expedition is still years away, but the team has been awarded a grant from Nasa to continue their work. VIDEO: A demonstration of the Super Ball Bot . Ideally teams of dozens or even hundreds of small, collapsible robots, weighing only a few kilograms a piece, will be conveniently packed during launch and would reliably separate and unpack at their destination .","Super Ball Bot’s spherical design absorbs the shock of impact on landing .

"How would the Earth fare if it was pitted against other planets in a game of marbles? The scale of the universe in terms of size is mind-bending enough – but considering the mass of planets can provide a new perspective. This animation, created by a former astronomer, reveals the comparative masses of planets in the solar system as they cascade down onto Earth. Scroll down for videos... It shows how, while Earth is four times larger than the moon, it is 87 times more massive. Mars is half the size of Earth and has a mass ten times smaller. Mercury, meanwhile is just over a third as large as our planet, but is 18 times less massive. The visualisation was created by Prague-based astronomer Rhys Taylor for his ‘Physicists formerly of the Caribbean’ blog. ‘Mercury isn't much to look at, but it's almost as hot as Venus and colder than Mars, constantly,’ Mr Taylor writes. ‘It has no atmosphere to spread the heat around, so the side facing the sun is roasting hot and the other side would make a taunton wish for thermal underwear.’ Mercury's high density could be because it's the core of a larger planet, with the lighter material having been blasted into space by a collision billions of years ago. Venus is about the same mass as Earth. Earth is twice the size of Mars and about nine times more massive. Mecury is just over a third as large as Earth and 18 times less massive. The moon is a quarter the size of Earth and 82 times less massive. Pluto is slightly smaller than the moon, but the Earth is 460 times as massive. Earth has a mass over 6,000 times greater than Ceres. It’s the lightest planet in our solar system, making anything there a third of the weight it is on Earth. That’s because its mass is much smaller than that of Earth’s and its gravity is a third of our planets. Ceres is the largest asteroid, with a diameter the same as the length of the UK. Earth has a mass over 6,000 times greater than Ceres. This is an unfair battle, however, as Earth always wins in these comparisons with only smaller worlds being featured. To see how Earth battles it out with larger bodies such as the sun, Mr Taylor has created another video called ‘Blue Marbles’.","The animation was created by Prague-based astronomer, Rhys Taylor .

"Colours have the ability to stir emotions - from red for anger, and blue for sadness - yet one artist has taken this a step further by converting these colours into music. Neil Harbisson was born with achromatopsia, the most extreme form of colour-blindness, which leaves him only able to see in black and white. He created an electronic ‘eye’ that lets him ‘hear’ colours as different musical frequencies - and has now used this system to conduct the world’s first 'colour choir'. Scroll down for video .

Harbisson can then hear these tones, through the antenna, using bone conduction. As part of Vodafone’s Firsts campaign, Harbisson used this system to teach an orchestra in Spain to recognise which colours go with which frequencies. They then performed a piece of music based on his teaching. The composition was created using colours taken from an image of the Palau de la Musica in Barcelona. It was performed by 42 members of the Palau’s Youth Choir and the Catalan Quartic String Quartet.

"Life on Earth could have started in volcanic vents on the seafloor, scientists believe. Researchers have developed a new approach to simulating the processes that may have led to the emergence of cell metabolism on Earth - a crucial biological function for all living organisms. The research could help scientists understand whether it is possible for life to have emerged in similar environments on other worlds. Life on Earth could have started in volcanic vents on the seafloor, scientists believe. The research could help scientists understand whether it is possible for life to have emerged in similar environments on other worlds . Co-author Terry Kee, of the University of Leeds, said: 'What we are trying to do is to bridge the gap between the geological processes of the early Earth and the emergence of biological life on this planet.' Scientists claim certain geological environments, such as hydrothermal vents can be considered as 'environmental fuel cells'. This is because  electrical energy can be generated from redox reactions between hydrothermal fuels and seawater oxidants, such as oxygen. A redox reaction is when one molecule loses electrons - is oxidised - and one molecule gains electrons. Researchers in Japan showed last year that electrical power can be harnessed from these vents in a deep-sea experiment in Okinawa. In the new study, researchers have demonstrated a proof of concept for their fuel cell model that links to the emergence of life on Earth. Scientists hope to nowy test whether any given hydrothermal system could produce enough energy to start life. Previously, some scientists have proposed that living organisms may have been transported to Earth by meteorites. However, there is more support for the theory that life emerged on Earth in places like hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor, forming from inanimate matter such as the chemical compounds found in gases and minerals. Dr Kee said: 'Before biological life, one could say the early Earth had ""geological life"". It may seem unusual to consider geology, involving inanimate rocks and minerals, as being alive. But what is life? 'Many people have failed to come up with a satisfactory answer to this question. So what we have done instead is to look at what life does, and all life forms use the same chemical processes that occur in a fuel cell to generate their energy.' Fuel cells in cars generate electrical energy by reacting fuels and oxidants. This is an example of a 'redox reaction', as one molecule loses electrons - is oxidised - and one molecule gains electrons. Similarly, photosynthesis in plants involves generating electrical energy from the reduction of carbon dioxide into sugars and the oxidation of water into molecular oxygen. And respiration in cells in the human body is the oxidation of sugars into carbon dioxide and the reduction of oxygen into water, with electrical energy produced in the reaction. Certain geological environments, such as hydrothermal vents can be considered as 'environmental fuel cells', since electrical energy can be generated from redox reactions between hydrothermal fuels and seawater oxidants, such as oxygen. Researchers in Japan showed last year that electrical power can be harnessed from these vents in a deep-sea experiment in Okinawa. In the new study, published online in the journal Astrobiology, the researchers have demonstrated a proof of concept for their fuel cell model of the emergence of cell metabolism on Earth. The theory suggests life emerged on Earth in places like hydrothermal vents (pictured) on the ocean floor, forming from inanimate matter such as the chemical compounds found in gases and minerals . The team replaced traditional platinum catalysts in fuel cells and electrical experiments with those composed of geological minerals. Study lead author Dr Laura Barge, from the Nasa Astrobiology Institute 'Icy Worlds' team, said: 'Certain minerals could have driven geological redox reactions, later leading to a biological metabolism. 'We're particularly interested in electrically conductive minerals containing iron and nickel that would have been common on the early Earth.' Iron and nickel are much less reactive than platinum. However, a small but significant power output successfully demonstrated that these metals could still generate electricity in the fuel cell - and hence also act as catalysts for redox reactions within hydrothermal vents in the early Earth. Dr Barge added: 'These experiments simulate the electrical energy produced in geological systems, so we can also use this to simulate other planetary environments with liquid water, like Jupiter's moon Europa or early Mars. 'With these techniques we could actually test whether any given hydrothermal system could produce enough energy to start life, or even, provide energetic habitats where life might still exist and could be detected by future missions.'","Previously, some scientists have proposed that living organisms may have been transported to Earth by meteorites .

Take-off: Vertical and landings without runways or forward speed . Safety features: Roll bar and airbags . Cost: $85,000 (£50,730) with a refundable $5,000 (£2,983) deposit . Release date: Slated for 2017 . The Aero-X is available to pre-order for $85,000 (£50,730) with a delivery date of 2017, so sci-fi fans could be taking them for joy rides relatively soon. Aerofex told MailOnline: 'While development timing is always tricky to predict, we have been working on the vehicle for quite a long time...Although it may not appear the case, in our eyes the Aero-X is very similar to our flying prototype, which gives us confidence we are on path to deliver as promised.' A $5,000 (£2,983) refundable deposit is needed. The vehicle is a hovercraft that reportedly rides like a motorbike and because of this, users can learn to operate it within a weekend. The company says that the two-seater vehicle can be adapted for different off-road uses, such as search and rescue, border patrol, disaster relief and farming. Although judging by the popular sci-fi film, driving it in a forest may prove perilous. The Aero-X can fly for up to one-and-a-half hours and measures almost 15ft (4.5 metres) long, 7ft (2metres) wide and is 4ft (1.25 metres) high. It weighs in at 785lbs (365kg). Star Wars for real: The real-life hoverbike created by California firm Aerofex was tested in the Mojave desert and a video revealing the innovation to the world was released in 2012 . Soon you could be a Jedi: Aerofex's Aero-X bike resembles the hoverbikes that feature in Return of the Jedi, where they were used in a thrilling forest chase (pictured) Futuristic: The 21st century Earth version is built primarily of carbon fibre and has two ducted rotors facing the ground (pictured) enabling it to hover. The vehicle has been tested in the desert and consumers should be able to get their hands on it in 2017, according to the California-based firm . Built primarily of carbon fibre, it has two ducted rotors facing the ground enabling it to hover. Changing the angle of the rotors using two control sticks allows it to manoeuvred in different directions. The hoverbike responds to a pilot's leaning movements and natural sense of balance. It takes off vertically and lands without runways or forward speed. The production model will have numerous safety features including a roll bar and whole vehicle airbags. Hovering bikes were made famous by 'Return of the Jedi,' where they were piloted by Stormtroopers and flown through a forest, but the real life version has been tested in the safer surroundings of the Mojave Desert. In 2012 Aerofex released a video of an employee riding the vehicle and at the time said that it planned on releasing pilotless-versions of the technology at the end of this year. As to whether we will be riding hoverbikes to work in the future, the Aerofex said: 'I do not think you will ever see these vehicles on the road. They are designed for rural utility and would not be useful as a commuter vehicle. In addition, the legal barriers to such use are presently very high. 'We may see a derivative of this type of vehicle over the roads in the far off future, but that path is difficult to foresee.' The hoverbike responds to a human pilot's leaning movements and natural sense of balance. It takes off vertically and lands without runways or forward speed, much like the fictional version in Star Wars (pictured)","A company in California created the bike that will let people reach speeds of 45mph (72km/h) while hovering up to 12ft (3.6metres) above the ground .

"Space may be the final frontier, but there is still an vast expanse of uncharted territory deep beneath the sea on our own planet. But this could be about to change thanks to an unlikely new aid to explorers and scientists: a giant robotic crab. Makers of the monstrous machine claim that it's the world’s largest and deepest underwater walking robot. Scroll down for videos . The world's deepest and largest underwater robot could be used in scientific exploration projects as well as fixing structures far beneath the waves such as pipes used to carry oil and gas . According to plans for the robot, Crabster will feature: . Weighing in at 1,400lbs (635kg), Crabster CR200 is designed to scuttle along the sea floor like a real crustacean and uses complex mechanics to stabilise itself. It is envisioned that the robot could be used in scientific exploration projects as well as fixing structures far beneath the waves such as pipes used to carry oil and gas. In a concept video, the team imagines that robot might be able to pick up objects and stow them in a compartment that looks a bit like a mouth, although the real version does not have these features. Because of its size and weight, the robot could also be used instead of a scuba diver in strong underwater currents. A concept drawing reveals the robot has a colour HD camera that can zoom in to inspect items up close as well as a host of other features pictured here . Weighing in at 1,400lbs (635kg) Crabster CR200 is designed to scuttle along the sea floor like a real crustacean (seen in this conceptual illustration) and uses clever mechanics to stabilise itself . It can steady itself on its six legs and in strong currents, puts its ‘head’ down and raises its rear end to face the flow head-on, PopSci reported. The crab has 11 cameras on board including an acoustic camera to see in cloudy waters by using reflected sound waves to make realtime videos composed of between four and 30 frames a second. A concept drawing reveals the robot has a colour HD camera that can zoom in to inspect items up close and can send the data back via a 1,640ft (500metre) long tether that also allows human operators to control the crab. According to plans, the robot uses a ‘doppler’ to gauge the speed and direction of moving water and acoustic ‘pings’ to communicate its location on the sea floor. It can steady itself on its six legs and in strong currents, puts its 'head' down and raises its rear end to face the flow head-on. A conceptual illustration is pictured . The robot could use sonar to create 3D maps of its watery surroundings and can move at a top speed of 1 mph (1.6 km/h). It has been built by engineers at the Korea Institute of Ocean Science and Technology and completed its first underwater mission last summer. The scientists plan to test the robots at a depth of 656ft (200 metres) before taking Crabster to the Yellow Sea to help archaeologists examine 12th century shipwrecks that have lain undisturbed for hundreds of years. The project is being supported by the Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs (MLTM) in South Korea.

"It may appear to be a barren, hostile world today, but soon Mars could be host to blooming flowers and hanging fruit, if Nasa has its way. The space agency is planning to send seeds on its next Mars rover, which is scheduled to launch in mid-2020 and land on the red planet in 2021.

At nearly £14,000 ($23,000) to send a kilogram of food into space, cosmic cuisine doesn’t come cheap. But Nasa hopes that in the future it can grow vast quantities of its own food in space.

It . could also provide something called ‘horticultural therapy’ for . astronauts to reduce stress, alleviate depression and improve their . overall general health. The work is part of the Vegetable Production System (Veggie) to grow six romaine lettuce plants under pink LED lamps. Nasa . claims that after extensive testing on plants on Earth, it doesn’t . expect zero-gravity conditions to affect the growth of the plants . ‘In order to do a long-term, sustainable base on Mars, you would want to be able to establish that plants can at least grow on Mars,’ MPX deputy principal investigator Heather Smith told the ‘Humans 2 Mars’ conference in Washington. ‘This would be the first step in that…we just send the seeds there and watch them grow.’ MPX would use a CubeSat box – a case used for smaller and cheaper satellites — which would be attached to the outer body of the 2020 rover. This box would hold Earth air and about . 200 seeds of Arabidopsis, a small flowering plant that is widely used as . a model organism in plant biology. Seeds would receive water when the rover touched down on the red planet, and would then be allowed to grow for two weeks or so.

The hope is the alien garden would allow researchers to see how Earth life can cope with the red planet's high radiation levels and low gravity . Compared to Earth, the environmental conditions on Mars are extreme with a non-breathable thin, low pressure carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere, extremely strong radiation from the sun. Temperatures are on average -63 °C and it has 38 per cent of the gravity that we have on the Earth. With plans underway for a manned-mission to Mars, any possibility of humans growing their own food on this hostile planet would mean a smaller launch cost and a higher chance of survival. ‘We would go from this simple experiment to the greenhouses on Mars for a sustainable base,’ Ms Smith said. ‘That would be the goal.’ ‘It also would be the first multicellular organism to grow, live and die on another planet.’ Super bugs from Earth could . soon hitch a ride into space, arrive on the red planet and trick . scientists into thinking they are Martians.

"Flowers may be used to show someone you care, but it’s unlikely many people would appreciate receiving this floral behemoth. The Titan arum is the world’s largest, smelliest flower and after two years of waiting, a specimen at the Eden Project in Cornwall has finally bloomed. The 9ft 3in-tall (2.8 metre) plant is only expected to live for the next 48 hours - and just missed out on breaking the project's Titan record by 3.5 inches. The Titan arum is the world's largest, smelliest flower and a specimen at Cornwall's Eden Project, pictured with expert Tim Grigg, bloomed earlier today. The 9ft 3in-tall (2.8 metre) plant is only expected to live for the next 48 hours - and just missed out on breaking the project's Titan record by just 3.5 inches . The Titan Arum is native to Sumatra and is a distant relative of the Arum lily called 'Lords and Ladies'. When it is ready to be pollinated the giant flower heats up, giving off the smell that is a mixture of dimethyl disulphide and dimethyl trisulphide. This pungent smell is similar to the stench produced by rotting bodies, and as a result the plant is also known as the 'corpse flower'. The two noxious substances attract insects and once they land on the leaves, the plant closes over and covers them in pollen so it can cross-pollinate itself to reproduce. As big as it is, the Eden Project's specimen has some way to go until threatens the world record for tallest Titan Arum, which belongs to a 10ft (3.1-metre) mammoth grown in New Hampshire in 2010. According to gardeners at the attraction, . near St Austell in Cornwall, the plant was growing at a rate of between . six and eight inches (15cm and 20cm) a day earlier this week. They had expected it to flower either . over the weekend or early next week - almost a year to the day since the . last one bloomed - but it arrived early. It is the ninth Titan to flower at Eden, but is the first one to bloom twice. Titan arums normally live for between seven and 10 years before flowering for as little as 48 hours and then dying. This plant is a first for Eden as the project's resident expert Tim Grigg cut the flower back after it first bloomed in 2011, and to his amazement it flowered again. In 2011, it claimed the title of Eden's biggest ever Titan, measuring 9ft 6.5in (2.9 metres) at its tallest.

"Mars has been roved across, dug into and drilled by various rovers - but so far no machine has delved very deep beneath the surface. That's all set to change in September 2016, when Nasa's newest mission to the red planet - InSight - will arrive. The spacecraft completed a successful Mission Critical Design Review last Friday - and Nasa and its international partners have now given the go-ahead for construction of the lander. NASA's Interior Exploration Using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight) mission will pierce deep beneath the Martian surface to study its interior for the first time. The launch is scheduled for March 2016 with arrival at the red planet set for September that year . Nasa’s Interior Exploration Using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight) mission will pierce beneath the Martian surface to study its interior. The first spacecraft to successfully fly by Mars was Nasa's Mariner 4 in 1967, after several failed attempts by the Soviet Union. But the Soviet Union's Mars 3 probe was the first to successfully land on the surface, on 2 December 1971. Next, in the latter half of 1976, Nasa's Viking landers touched down on the surface and performed the first search for life on Mars - with results being inconclusive. The first rover on Mars was Sojourner, carried by Mars Pathfinder, which landed on 27 September 1997. This was followed by the hugely successful Spirit and Opportunity rovers in 2004, the latter of which is still operational today. Nasa's Curiosity rover is also still currently hard at work on the surface. Later this year two new orbiting spacecraft will arrive at Mars, India's Mangalyaan (their first mission to Mars) and Nasa's Maven. After Insight in 2016, Esa will land a rover called ExoMars on the surface in 2018. This will be followed by an as yet unnamed Nasa rover similar to Curiosity but with different instruments in 2020. The mission will investigate how terrestrial rocky planets like Earth formed and developed their layered inner structure of core, mantle and crust. It will also collect information about those interior zones using instruments that have never been used before on Mars. InSight will launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base, on the central California coast near Lompoc, in March 2016. This will be the first interplanetary mission ever to launch from California. The mission will help inform the agency’s goal of sending a human mission to Mars in the 2030s. InSight team leaders presented mission-design results last week to a NASA review board, which approved advancing to the next stage of preparation. The next step will be to begin integrating the various bits of hardware with computer systems, which will begin in November. 'We now move from doing the design and analysis to building and testing the hardware and software that will get us to Mars and collect the science that we need to achieve mission success,' said Tom Hoffman, InSight Project Manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, in a release statement. Scientists think that by studying the interior of Mars (shown in this illustration) they will have a better understanding of how terrestrial rocky plants like Earth can form. InSight will be capable of drilling up to 15 feet (4.5 metres) beneath the surface and could provide this information . To investigate the planet's interior, the stationary lander will carry a robotic arm that will deploy surface and burrowing instruments contributed by France and Germany. The national space agencies of France and Germany - Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales (CNES) and Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR) - are partnering with Nasa by providing InSight's two main science instruments. The Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS) will be built by CNES in partnership with DLR and the space agencies of Switzerland and the United Kingdom. It will measure waves of ground motion carried through the interior of the planet, from 'marsquakes' and meteor impacts. The Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, from DLR, will measure heat coming toward the surface from the planet's interior. 'Mars actually offers an advantage over Earth itself for understanding how habitable planetary surfaces can form,' said Bruce Banerdt, InSight Principal Investigator from JPL. 'Both planets underwent the same early processes. But Mars, being smaller, cooled faster and became less active while Earth kept churning. 'So Mars better preserves the evidence about the early stages of rocky planets' development.' InSight will have a number of instruments designed by agencies across the globe. Germany and France, for example, will be helping to design a seismic experiment that can measure waves of ground motion carried through the interior of the planet . The three-legged InSight lander will go to a site near the Martian equator and provide information for a planned mission length of 720 days - about two years. InSight adapts a design from the successful NASA Phoenix Mars Lander, which examined ice and soil on far-northern Mars in 2008. 'We will incorporate many features from our Phoenix spacecraft into InSight, but the differences between the missions require some differences in the InSight spacecraft,' said InSight Program Manager Stu Spath of Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company, Denver, Colorado. 'For example, the InSight mission duration is 630 days longer than Phoenix, which means the lander will have to endure a wider range of environmental conditions on the surface.' Guided by images of the surroundings taken by the lander, InSight's robotic arm will place the seismometer on the surface and then place a protective covering over it to minimize effects of wind and temperature on the sensitive instrument. The arm will also put the heat-flow probe in position to hammer itself into the ground to a depth of 9 to 15 feet (2.7 to 4.5 metres). Another experiment will use the radio link between InSight and NASA's Deep Space Network antennas on Earth to precisely measure a wobble in Mars' rotation that could reveal whether it has a molten or solid core. Wind and temperature sensors from Spain's Centro de Astrobiologia and a pressure sensor will monitor weather at the landing site, and a magnetometer will measure magnetic disturbances caused by the Martian ionosphere.","Construction of Nasa's next mission to Mars, InSight, has been approved .

"It has expanded around the world at an astonishing rate, taking on cab firms in major cities around the globe. Car firm Uber, described as 'one of the most rapidly growing companies ever,' was today valued at $18.2bn, one of the highest valuations ever for a Silicon Valley startup. The firm, which relies on an app and software to match riders and drivers, was started in 2010 - and now operates in 128 cities across 37 countries. Uber is taking on cab firms around the world - and was today valued at $18.2bn . Customers can see the  driver’s name and photo before they arrive and receive an email of their route to ensure they have not gone around the houses. Uber takes a cut, usually 11 to 20 per cent, of the fares, which are taken from customers’ credit cards at the end of the journey — when they can also rate their trip. Journey costs increase during busy periods, but customers are not encouraged to tip because the gratuity is factored into the metered fare. The firm has raised $1.2 billion from mutual funds and other investors in a funding round valuing the fast-growing rides-on-demand service at $18.2 billion. Uber Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick announced the funding round on Uber's blog Friday. The funding, eclipsed only by the likes of Facebook Inc before it went public, is a vote of confidence by investors in four-year-old Uber's growth potential. 'Uber is one of the most rapidly growing companies ever, and we believe there are opportunities for continued tremendous growth,' Joan Miller, a spokeswoman for Summit Partners, an investor in the funding round, said by telephone. Investors hope the company, which allows users to summon a ride on their smartphones, can expand globally and diversify into logistics. The investors in the round valued Uber 'pre-money' at $17 billion, the blog post said. The $1.2 billion infusion took the startup's valuation to $18.2 billion. Fidelity Investments put in about $425 million, Wellington Management added $209 million and BlackRock Inc contributed $175 million, according to a person familiar with the matter. Venture firms Summit Partners, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Google Ventures and Menlo Ventures also participated in the round, a person familiar with the matter said. Kleiner's investment came from its Digital Growth Fund, run by former stock analyst Mary Meeker, known for her bullish recommendations during the first dot-com boom. While Uber has grown rapidly since its 2010 launch in San Francisco, it has run into serious regulatory issues. Ordinances keep it out of cities such as Las Vegas, Miami and Vancouver, British Canada. In some places, including Chicago, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., Uber and similar companies face lawsuits from taxi companies hoping to keep the new competition out. In Colorado, Governor John Hickenlooper signed a bill on Thursday that legalized drive-for-hire services in consumers' own vehicles, including UberX. In California, ridesharing is currently regulated through the state's Public Utilities Commission, although taxi drivers and Uber itself are challenging that authority. Her fund has had recent hits, including traffic app Waze, acquired last year for $1.1 billion by Google. Uber, which did not give details about its latest investors, operates in 128 cities across 37 countries. Kalanick said he expected to close a second round of funding from strategic investors of about $200 million. Uber originally started with a luxury town-car service, but in many cities has since added UberX, a low-frills service with nonprofessional drivers using personal cars. Competitors to Uber include Flywheel and Hailo, which connect passengers and taxis; and Lyft and Sidecar, which link passengers and drivers who use their personal vehicles. Uber sometimes offers promotional deliveries, such as roses around Valentine's Day or Christmas trees. Earlier this year, it launched a regular courier delivery service for small packages in Manhattan.","Uber has raised $1.2 billion from mutual funds and other investors .

"For many people, chatting to friends is a major reason to use Facebook’s app on their smartphone. But soon they will have to download the social network’s partner app, called Messenger, to carry on their instant conversations. Facebook is reportedly notifying users of its popular app that they will no longer be able to send 'chat' messages and will instead have to swap to Messenger, which was launched three years ago. It follows the company's acquisition of another popular messaging app, WhatsApp, for US$19billion. Scroll down for video . Time for a new conversation: Facebook is notifying users of its popular app that they will soon no longer be able to send messages using it and will instead have to swap to Messenger (pictured), which was launched three years ago . People living in Europe with Android handsets and iPhones will be the first to be affected by the change, according to the company, which did not reveal a specific timeline. ‘Messenger is a much faster and better experience and we've found that people get replies 20 per cent faster on Messenger than on Facebook,’ a spokesman for the company told CNN. ‘Taking messages out of the Facebook app also lets us focus on making Messenger even better for everyone rather than working on two separate Facebook messaging experiences.’ The company halted messaging in the main app for people who have already downloaded Messenger in November, following the launch of Messenger 3.0. Incentives to change: 'Messenger is a much faster and better experience and we've found that people get replies 20 per cent faster on Messenger than on Facebook,' a spokesman for the company said. It also has extra features like the private sending of photos (pictured left) and free calls (right) The Messenger app works in a similar way to Facebook’s core message feature, and users will tap a ‘message’ icon within the main app to be directed to Messenger. Facebook has indicated that it is taking renewed interest in its messaging features following the  WhatsApp takeover. WhatsApp is particularly popular outside America and lets people send unlimited messages for US$0.99cents a year. It has been widely reported that Facebook has no immediate plans to merge WhatsApp with Messenger. MailOnline is awaiting a response from Facebook. Both services, as well as many more, are becoming a mainstream alternative to texting, particularly in parts of the world like Africa, India and South America where unlimited texts are not included in mobile contract bundles. Not just for status updates? In the future you could also use Facebook to make electronic payments and stash money. The social network is rumoured to be seeking regulatory approval from the Central Bank of Ireland to become an emoney institution . In the future, Facebook's 1.2-billion users could use the network to make electronic payments and save money as well as send messages. The social network is rumoured to be seeking regulatory approval to offer financial services - including electronic money and remittances - which would, for example, allow foreign workers to easily transfer money back to their families. Facebook is seeking regulatory approval from the Central Bank of Ireland, which, if it is granted, would allow people to store money on the social network, transfer it to other users and pay for goods, according to a report by The Financial Times. The Central Bank of Ireland told MailOnline 'it is not commenting on the issue at the moment', and Facebook said it does not comment on rumour or speculation. A move into remittances would help Facebook gain an even stronger foothold in emerging markets including India and Africa. While Facebook has not commented on the rumours a source, said to be familiar with the details, told The FT: ‘Facebook wants to become a utility in the developing world and remittances are a gateway drug to financial inclusion.’ If those in developing nations flock to Facebook, the company would boost its advertising revenues, and e-money services could become a big attraction - it would be particularly useful to users in areas without easy access to banks. Elizabeth Cobbett, lecturer in International Political Economy at the University of East Anglia (UEA), told MailOnline: 'The materiality of banking and finance is changing rapidly and this change is most visible in emerging markets where they do not have the infrastructure in place. So it is a clean slate for new technology. 'This is clearly evident in Africa. Facebook wants in on the game and the huge potential market.'She explained that there are two-and-a-half billion 'unbanked' adults across the globe and so the potential market is huge.","Social network reportedly plans to disconnect its Facebook 'chat' function .

Last week more than 50 researchers and specialists published a letter after claiming to have seen a leaked document from the World Health Organisation (WHO) which labelled the e-cigarettes as a 'threat'. The letter urges health officials to consider the health consequences of such a move, amid fears e-cigarettes will become harder to obtain. But critics say that not enough is known about the long-term effects of the devices, which deliver nicotine in a vapour. The e-cigarette is linked to a smartphone by Bluetooth in order to transfer information. Users can then view statistics over the last 30 days to see what their vaping - the term given to breathing nicotine-infused e-cigarette liquid - habits are. The device costs €80 (£65; $80) and includes a 900 mAh battery, which can hold about seven hours of charge. The electronic 'brain' of the device lets a user track usage and check their vaping history. When they smoke it monitors their usage and trends, telling them when and where they've vaped using GPS technology. It also shows users the equivalent consumption that would be smoked with cigarettes. The app then reveals to a smoker how their health would differ if they had continued smoking. This includes things such as blood oxygenation levels, taste and smell, lung capacity and heart rejuvenation. Through this information the app then estimates how many days the user has added to their life expectancy. ‘This is based on data taken from the American Cancer Society,’ Johan Collet of Smokio explains to MailOnline. ‘This takes into account your age and how much you smoke. It’s a catalyst taking into account all of the things that will improve your health.’ This then gives an estimate for how many extra days a smoker is adding to their life expectancy by switching tobacco for vaping. ‘The Bluetooth microchip in the battery collects data from when you take a puff,’ continues Collet. ‘This includes the time of the puff, intensity of the puff and all things like that. ‘It then stores and transmits it to your smartphone where calculations are performed and spit out in more readable form.’ The . effects of e-cigarettes are still largely unknown, with various . agencies such as the US Food and Drug administration currently . performing studies. A . study in the journal Addiction last month, however, found that 20 per . cent of nearly 6,000 smokers quit smoking with the help of e-cigarettes. The accompanying Smokio app gives a user information from the past 30 days (middle). This includes information on when and where they've used the device (left) and their health (right), such as the change in blood oxygenation levels and heart rejuvenation, although the data is not gathered by measuring vital signs .","Paris-based company has designed the world's first 'smart' e-cigarette .

"A rare European butterfly called the continental swallowtail (pictured) has succeeded in breeding in Britain for the first time . A rare European butterfly has succeeded in breeding in Britain for the first time. The continental swallowtail - a large yellow and black butterfly with a long streamer-shaped tail - has been spotted 12 times in Sussex in recent days. The butterfly is thought to have migrated from France during last summer’s heatwave, when it was seen several times along the south coast. But wildlife experts are amazed the insect has managed to survive the winter, and even breed and produce young. Michael Blencowe, of the Butterfly Conservation charity’s Sussex Branch, has been monitoring the butterflies since they arrived last summer. He said: ‘So far there have been 12 sightings of swallowtails in Sussex this spring. ‘Six of these have been seen to emerge from pupae we were monitoring, others have been seen in Peacehaven, Chichester, Chanctonbury Ring and Horsham. ‘There are still more to emerge and no doubt many other swallowtails that we don’t know about are roaming the country, so there has never been a more exciting to me to head out looking for butterflies. ‘This current invasion could be the start of the colonisation of Southern England by the swallowtail. In 20 years this butterfly could be a regular visitor to our gardens.’ The UK boasts its own subspecies of swallowtail - Papilio machaon britannicus (pictured as a caterpillar) - which is Britain's largest native species but is smaller and darker than the continental butterfly . Sightings have been made in Peacehaven (marked at A), Chichester, Chanctonbury Ring and Horsham in Sussex. The UK's own subspecies of swallowtail - Papilio machaon britannicus - is smaller and darker than the continental butterfly, and typically found in the Norfolk Broads (marked at B) The continental swallowtail, which has a . wingspan of up to three and a half inches (9cm), is common across the warmer . parts of Europe, but previously it was considered unable to survive . Britain’s cold winters. Last summer’s sightings were the first in the UK since 1945. The hot weather, followed by an unusually mild winter and spring, may have provided the conditions suitable for breeding. The continental swallowtail (pictured) - a large yellow and black butterfly with a long streamer-shaped tail - has been spotted 12 times in Sussex . The UK boasts its own subspecies of swallowtail - Papilio machaon britannicus - which is Britain’s largest . native species, but is smaller and darker than the continental butterfly. It only lives in the Norfolk Broads, where it feeds on milk parsley alone, a plant that is confined to the fenlands. Its continental cousin - Papilio machaon gorganus - is less fussy and can feed on related umbellifer plants, such as fennel, cow parsley, hogweed and the leaves of carrots. The emergence of the swallowtail is a welcome boost for butterfly conservationists, after a steady decline in the number of British butterflies. The loss of wildflower meadows, use of chemicals in farming and the growth of cities has meant the insects have struggled to survive. A string of damp and cool summers have also hit butterfly populations, which thrive in sunny and warm conditions. Last year’s hot weather was excellent for butterflies, with numbers up significantly compared to the washout summer of 2012, according to the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme. But despite the 2013 population boost, numbers last year were still only half of the population seen when the scheme started in 1976. Butterfly Conservation has asked that anyone who spots swallowtails in Southern England send details to www.sussex-butterflies.org.uk. The UK's subspecies of swallowtail only lives in the Norfolk Broads (pictured), where it feeds on milk parsley alone, a plant that is confined to the fenlands. However, its continental counterpart is a less fussy eater . Gritting the roads with salt increases wing power in butterflies and boosts their brain size, according to a study released earlier this week. Research by Minnesota University found male insects that fed on plants rich in sodium that had run off from nearby roads had bigger muscles - while the females had larger eyes. Scientists claim that this suggests humans are having a previously unknown effect on wildlife. Butterflies do not eat but suck up fluids containing nectar and other nutrients. They are particularly fond of salt, which is why they often land on people to feast on their sweat. Now, researchers have found salt run-off from roads - such as when it is used to clear snow - altered development of their brain and flight muscles. They compared levels of sodium in grass, mustard, oak and milkweed growing in ditches within 16 feet  (five metres) of a county road, and in prairies at least 330 feet (100 metres) from a paved road in a nature reserve near Minneapolis. The roadside milkweed and oak had 1.5 to 30 times higher concentrations of sodium in its leaves, compared with those further away. When monarch butterflies (pictured above) were reared on roadside milkweed containing 16 times more salt, males had an increased amount of thoracic protein - an indicator for wing power that is crucial to the insects’ migration. Female monarchs had larger eyes relative to those reared on prairie milkweed, while cabbage white butterflies raised on an artificial diet with medium (3,000 parts per million) or low (400 parts per million) sodium levels showed developmental differences. Males on the medium sodium diet had greater thoracic protein, whereas females had greater brain volume.","The large yellow and black butterfly has been spotted 12 times in Sussex .

"An earthquake has struck the Rutland area of the East Midlands again, just 24 hours after a similar tremor shook houses in the area for ten seconds. Initial data released by the British Geological Survey (BGS) said the latest 3.5-magnitude quake, the biggest in the region since October 2001, struck the Oakham area at around 7:50 am today. Yesterday’s 3.2-magnitude quake occurred at 7:07am and reportedly shook houses. Today's earthquake struck at 7:50am, just 24 hours after the previous one hit at 7:07am on 17 April, causing some alarm for members of the public . The UK is not itself generally associated with earthquakes. However, according to the BGS, 20 to 30 tremors are felt every year, while a few smaller ones are tracked by sensitive instruments. While most are small and cause no damage, there is the potential for larger ones in future. The UK does not lie on a major fault line, but it’s thought that smaller unseen fault lines, known as blind fault lines, are deeper underground. Nearby tectonic boundaries such as that between Eurasia and Africa can induce tremors in smaller fault lines like the ones in the UK. 27 February 2008Magnitude 5.2 – Lincolnshire02 April 19905.1 - Shropshire07 June 19316.1 – North Sea09 November 18525.3 – Caernarvon6 April 15805.8 – Dover straits . ‘If you look at your hand, imagine the main lines as a major tectonic boundary,’ Glenn Ford, a seismologist at the BGS, explains to MailOnline. ‘Between these are little lines, and if you gently squeeze your hand you see that even these smaller lines move back and forwards.’ While today’s earthquake was large for the UK, tremors are a common and largely unnoticed occurrence across the rest of the world. It is estimated that 17,000 to 20,000 earthquakes of this size occur every year in the world. However, seismologists think that a larger one could strike the mainland UK one day and cause significant damage. ‘This particular one was 3.5 which in UK terms is quite significant,’ says Ford. ‘We maybe get one or two a year of that size. ‘We had a 4.1 in the Bristol Channel back on the 20th of February. They’re not like buses - they come when they want, but statistically we don’t get many of this size.’ It's thought that millions of years ago the UK could have been situated over a major fault line such as the San Andreas Fault, pictured at Carrizo Plain National Monument in California, USA . For residents of Rutland, the tremors proved to be cause for some alarm. Within half an hour of the first quake striking, the BGS had received around 140 calls from people who had felt the tremors. According . to the BGS, an earthquake has to reach a magnitude of 4.5 before it can . be expected to do any damage. Emergency services have not reported any . casualties or damage to property. Among . those who felt yesterday's tremor was former English rugby union player Austin . Healey. He tweeted: 'We've just had an earthquake in Oakham. The house . was shaking for about 10 secs.' Louise Warren, 40, was getting four year-old son Adam ready for school when it struck. Ms Warrwen, . of Stamford, Lincolnshire, said: 'The shaking sound started quite . suddenly and my electric toothbrush fell from the shelf into my sink. 'It felt like a lorry going past my house but about ten times louder. There was a second shake soon after the first one stopped. 'I wasn't too scared because I remember when we had a tremor here about eight years ago. 'My . son was a bit frightened because he'd never felt anything like it . before. But he's a boy, so he did think it was pretty cool.' A British Geological Survey chart shows the tremors from the first earthquake that hit Rutland shortly after 7am yesterday before the second earthquake, a magnitude 3.5, struck today . The spike in the seismology readings can clearly be seen when the first earthquake hit yesterday . The reason for two earthquakes occurring so close to each other might be the result of stresses building up in the faults. Magnitude 1 and 2 – Not felt by people, detected by instruments. Magnitude 3 – Silght tremor felt by people indoors, likened to a passing lorry. Magnitude 4 – Can crack walls, disturb trees. Magnitude 5 – Moves furniture, damages poorly built buildings. Magnitude 6 – Moderate to major damage, chimneys and walls collapse. Magnitude 7 – Major damage to all buildings, ground cracks, landslides can occur. Magnitude 8 – Total destruction, waves can be seen travelling through the ground. ‘In other parts of the world they wouldn’t be talking about this,' says Ford. ‘The tremor is very, very small compared to the quakes we see in areas of high seismic activity such as Greece. ‘For us 90 per cent of earthquakes are unnoticed, but when [the bigger ones] do happen we get alarmed. ‘The public is not calibrated to them, maybe because people think they don’t actually happen.’ Ford says this one was probably more noticeable as well because many people are off work for the Easter holiday. ‘This one happened at a good time today for people to feel it. ‘They are lying down in an ideal position to feel earthquakes, very small tremors that people would never expect to feel. ‘If you look at what people describe it’s like a large lorry going past. ‘An earthquake of this size can go . unnoticed up in the highlands, or if it happens at a time of day where . people are busy or in road traffic. ‘Many people today also realise another happened yesterday, so they are more aware. ‘People . are looking out for them now, and in shops and supermarkets they’ll be . saying “oh, did you feel the earthquake?” to each other.' Sensitive equipment is able to measure tiny tremors unnoticed by the public in the UK . Scientists from Columbia University claim fracking could cause powerful earthquakes capable of destroying buildings as the process of extracting gas weakens fault lines deep underground. American geologists said that a domino effect of quakes could be caused by intense pressure on fault lines created by hydraulic fracturing, combined with seismic activity thousands of miles away. The Columbia University scientists maintain that powerful earthquakes can trigger swarms of minor quakes near waste water injection wells like those used for in oil and gas recovery. They say a recent surge in U.S. oil and gas production using vast amounts of water to crack open rocks and release natural shale gas has been linked to an increase in small to moderate induced earthquakes in five states. Seismologists from the university have identified three quakes in Oklahoma, Colorado and Texas that they believe were triggered at injection well sites by a major earthquake a long distance away. The discovery, published in the journal Science by one of the world's leading seismology labs, threatens to make fracking even more controversial. A joint UK study of hydraulic fracturing by The Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering said that fracking can be managed effectively in the UK as long as operational best practices are implemented and robustly enforced through regulation. The experts also said that earth tremors induced by hydraulic fracturing are likely to be of a smaller magnitude than the UK naturally experiences or than is related to coal mining activities. The biggest earthquake on record to hit the UK was a 6.1 back in 1931. Fortunately this one hit offshore and didn’t cause much damage on the mainland, but Ford says there is the possibility that one of this size could still hit the mainland UK. ‘We’re quite a distance from immediate fault lines, like the Mid-Atlantic Ridge running up to Iceland. ‘But we do have a major plate tectonic boundary between the Eurasian plate and the African plate. ‘The African plate is rubbing up on the Eurasian plate, so that causes stresses that build up on existing fault lines the UK has. ‘Some could be a few metres long, some are long, but over time stresses build up. ‘Perhaps historically many millions of years ago they could have been more active. ‘I’m sure there were larger earthquakes at some time.' Earthquakes occur when tectonic plates rub together. For places like the UK, we experience tremors from smaller fault lines that are susceptible to these larger plate movements . When these might occur though, or why these two were localised in Rutland, remains a mystery. ‘There is a possibility one of that size can hit the mainland UK,' Ford continues. ‘The unusual feature of earthquakes is we don’t know where they might occur.’ ‘We don’t know why it was localised in Rutland. ‘There could be faults underground that we don’t know of. ‘In other parts of the world with earthquakes they don’t know of all the fault lines. ‘There could be lots of blind fault lines, we’ve got a long way to go to understand these processes through seismology.'","A magnitude 3.5 earthquake has struck Rutland again in the East Midlands .

"Breaking Bad actor Aaron Paul has been switching Xbox consoles on without permission. A TV advert starring the actor has left users of the Microsoft device bemused, and thousands have complained, because it takes advantage of the consoles' voice commands. In the ad, 34-year-old Paul uses the Xbox One's voice controls by saying 'Xbox On' so he can start playing on the console. Scroll down for video . Breaking Bad actor, Aaron Paul, (pictured) is switching everyone's Xbox consoles on without their permission. A TV advert starring the actor has left Xbox users bemused and annoyed, and thousands have complained it accidentally turns their consoles on . But thousands of gamers found the clip was able to also activate the voice recognition software on their own consoles, and turn them on. Gamer Tom Neal, from Chesterfield, Derbyshire is just one of many people who have taken to Twitter to complain about the advert. He tweeted: ‘@Xbox your new TV advert is annoying the hell outta me. Aaron Paul keeps turning my console on? Stoooop.’ The advert is showing on channels all over the world, and is meant to showcase the console's (pictured) features, including voice-activated commands. Earlier this week, Microsoft announced that it would start selling the Xbox One console without the Kinect for the first time . At the start of the 30-second clip, the Need for Speed actor, 34, says: 'After the role of a lifetime, I've been - busy. Xbox On' Qasssim Farid wrote: ‘Aaron Paul just turned my Xbox One via the Xbox advert.

At the start of the 30-second clip, the Need for Speed actor, 34, says: ‘After the role of a lifetime, I've been - busy. Xbox On.’ He also tells his console a series of other commands, including 'snap TV' which puts a small live TV window in the corner of the screen and to 'record that' - which records high definition footage of gameplay. Another advert showing Paul using voice commands to play the sci-fi shooter Titanfall is thought to have similar effects. However, Xbox One owners who want to avoid issuing or receiving accidental commands can disable the Kinect sensor. Earlier this week, Microsoft announced it would start selling the Xbox One console without the Kinect for the first time. The company hopes the move will allow it to match the price of Sony’s rival PS4 console. The new price for the console without the Kinect is $399 in the US and £350 in the UK.

"Apple is urging European iPhone customers to exchange their power adapters after an overheating issue was discovered. Adapters for the iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S models, shipped from October 2009 to September 2012, ‘may overheat and pose a safety risk’ the company said. Customers in the EU with a 5W USB power adapter matching this description are urged to take it to an Apple Store, where they will be given a replacement free of charge. Apple is urging owners of an iPhone 3GS, 4 or 4S (stock image shown) in the EU to exchange their USB chargers for a new model at any Apple store. Adapters bought from October 2009 to September 2012 were found to have a fault that could cause to overheat and pose a safety risk . Customers in the UK are not affected. To find out if an adapter is susceptible to the fault, customers are told to look at the label between the pins of the plug. Researchers at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology have unveiled an experimental wireless recharging system that could top up the mobile of everyone in an office wirelessly. The system can transmit power up to 16ft (five metres), charge up to 40 phones at a time, and is even powerful enough to run a TV. Called the 'Dipole Coil Resonant System', it is believed to be the longest range wireless power system developed so far. 'The way electronic devices receive their power has changed tremendously over the past few decades, from wired to non-wired,' the researchers say. Affected adapters are ‘Model A1300’ and have the letters CE in solid grey. This will be replaced with a Model A1400, with the letters CE outlined in grey. ‘Customer safety is always Apple’s top priority, and we have voluntarily decided to exchange every affected power adapter for a new, redesigned adapter, free of charge,' the company wrote on its support page. ‘We encourage customers to exchange any affected adapter for a new one as soon as possible using the exchange process below.' They continue: ‘If you have an affected adapter, discontinue use and exchange it for a new one.’ ‘Apple has voluntarily introduced a program . for customers to exchange the Apple 5W European USB Power Adapter which . came with iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S models through September . 2012. This, they say, is ‘because in rare cases the adapter may overheat and pose a safety risk.’ The European USB power adapter came with iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S models shipped from October 2009 to September 2012. It was also sold as a standalone accessory. The charger was sold in 37 countries including Albania, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Israel and Italy. It was also sold in Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and Vietnam. The affected USB adapters are the model A1300s, shown on the left. These also have the letters CE written in grey. The fixed adapter is shown on the right, which is a model A1400 and has the letters CE only outlined in grey. Owners of the adapter on the left are urged to exchange the plug at an Apple store . The affected two-pin plug, shown here, is used only by the iPhone 3GS, 4 and 4S in the EU. On their website Apple said: 'Customer safety is always Apple's top priority, and we have voluntarily decided to exchange every affected power adapter for a new, redesigned adapter, free of charge' The announcement follows similar problems for the tech giant. In late April, the Cupertino-based company admitted to the existence of a problem with the sleep/wake button on the iPhone 5. Two years after customer complaints began appearing online, the Cupertino-based company launched a free replacement scheme for any users affected by the power button issues. Apple said a ‘small percentage’ of iPhone 5 handsets had faulty mechanisms that can lead to problems with the switch. The fault prevents the device from being turned on and off, or locked in the usual way. This caused some iPhone models to stop working intermittently.","The California company is offering an exchange programme for adapters .

"Orbiting up to 270 miles (435 km) above the Earth, the International Space Station (ISS) is a long way from home. Among the many creature comforts missed by the astronauts, the most popular request is a good cup of coffee. But the wait will soon be over, as one Italian astronaut prepares to take an ISSpresso machine with her to perk up the crew. An Italian astronaut is bringing an ISSpresso machine (pictured) with her to the ISS. It is the first coffee machine able to work in micro gravity, where the principles that regulate the fluid dynamics of liquids and mixtures are very different from those typical on Earth . The ISSpresso machine uses a normal Lavazza coffee capsule, which is posted in the top of the machine. Water is aspirated and pressurised in a unique electrical system and is then heated. The granules mix with the hot water and the coffee is piped into a pouch, which is securely fastened to the machine using a 'rapid coupling/uncoupling system.' Astronauts drink the coffee straight from the pouch using a straw. Air Force Captain Samantha Cristoforetti is set to be not only be the first Italian woman to go into space, but also the first astronaut in history to drink an authentic espresso in orbit. She will be blasted to the space research laboratory in November, together with the drinks machine. as part of The Futura Mission. It will be the second long-term mission of the Italian Space Agency (ISA) aboard the space station. Coffee company Lavazza worked with engineering firm and space food specialists Argotec, as well as the, ISA to build a coffee machine to bring Italian espresso to the ISS. It is befittingly called ISSpresso, and is the first coffee machine able to work in micro gravity on the ISS, where the principles that regulate the fluid dynamics of liquids and mixtures are very different from those typical on Earth. The prototype machine is currently being tested. It uses a ‘capsule system’ to fill plastic pouches with espresso and other hot drinks such as tea. The machine can also be used to rehydrate food.

Air Force Captain Samantha Cristoforetti, could not only be the first Italian woman to go into space, but also the first astronaut in history to drink an authentic Italian espresso in orbit. The drinks will be made using this specially-designed machine. A typical model weighs 29lbs (13kg), but this model weighs around 44lbs (20kg) In order to handle liquids at high pressure and high temperature in a space environment, the plastic tubing inside the normal coffee machines has been replaced with a steel tubes designed to withstand pressure of more than 400 bar. The ISSpresso machine uses a standard coffee capsule, which is posted in the top of the machine. Water is aspirated and pressurised in a unique electrical system and is then heated. The granules mix with the hot water and the coffee is piped into a pouch, which is securely fastened to the machine using a 'rapid coupling/uncoupling system.' Astronauts drink the coffee straight from the pouch using a straw. The machine is much heavier than a normal model, which typically weighs 29lbs (13kg). The space-bound machine weighs around 44lbs (20kg) because there are backups of all the critical components, for safety reasons, and in accordance with the specifications agreed upon with the ISA. Hovering up to 270 miles (435 km) above the Earth, the International Space Station (pictured) is a long way from home and astronauts have reported missing creature comforts such as coffee and beer . ‘ISSpresso represents a technologically high-value project which, besides increasing the variety of flavour in the astronauts’ menu, will help improve our understanding of the principles of fluid dynamics and conditions in microgravity,’ its makers said. ‘Italian coffee is a beverage without borders and we have been thinking about taking the espresso into space for some time,’ said Giuseppe Lavazza, vice president of Lavazza. Ten years ago the company produced artwork designed to look like its coffee was in space, and ‘today we are in a position to overcome the limits of weightlessness and enjoy a good espresso ... on board the International Space Station,’ he continued. David Avino, managing director of Argotec added that the firm is also taking care of the European astronauts’ training and nutrition. ‘Food provides an important psychological support and being able to enjoy a good Italian espresso may be just the right way to finish off the menu designed especially for each astronaut, helping him or her to feel closer to home.’","Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti will take the machine to the International Space Station in November .

"Facebook's self-destructing message service is now available internationally, just a week after officially launching in the U.S. Called Slingshot, it is designed to appeal to fans of Snapchat and other messaging apps that let people send self-destructing messages to friends. However, the app adds a novel twist, as users cannot see a friend's picture until they send one back. Scroll down for video . Facebook's Slingshot app has begun rolling out internationally from today. It allows people to send messages to friends (pictured left), but they can only view them if they send a message back. The app also allows people to react to an image (right) After downloading the app, you can sign up either with a Facebook account or your mobile phone number. You add contacts based on your Facebook friends and phone contacts. Opening the app takes you to its camera, which has a 'shoot' button for taking a snapshot and a 'selfie' button. After taking a photo, you can type a message of up to 140 characters on it, draw a picture or send a 15-second video. You can then send it to some, or all, of your Slingshot contacts. On Slingshot, you can see a message only if you send one back. Until you do, you'll only see a pixelated preview of what's in store. 'With Slingshot, we wanted to build something where everybody is a creator and nobody is just a spectator,' Facebook said. 'When everyone participates, there’s less pressure, more creativity and even the little things in life can turn into awesome shared experiences. This is what Slingshot is all about.' Slingshot draws inevitable comparisons to Snapchat. Facebook even tried to buy Snapchat's maker for $3 billion, if reports are to be believed. But the two messaging services are different. Unlike Snapchat, there is no time limit on when a Slingshot message disappears. Once a person looks at a message, they can flick it off to the side of their screen so that it self destructs. Slingshot also allows reaction shots. It splits a user's screen in half and lets them snap a photo to return to the . sender. The recipient doesn't have to send back a message to . view the response. Slingshot works with both Apple and Android devices - on iOS 7 and Android Jelly Bean and KitKat. A Facebook account isn't required to use the new app. 'Photos and videos that don’t stick around forever allow for sharing that’s more expressive, raw and spontaneous,' said Facebook. The app shows a pixelated preview (left) until a 'sling' message is sent, at which point it is unlocked (right) 'We can connect the same way we like to live: in the moment. We’ve enjoyed using Snapchat to send each other ephemeral messages and expect there to be a variety of apps that explore this new way of sharing. 'With Slingshot, we saw an opportunity to create something new and different: a space where you can share everyday moments with lots of people at once.' Ten people have been working on Slingshot since January. It grew out of a December hackathon at Facebook where people were trying to figure out out 'new ways of sharing'.

"It's the part of the evening everyone hates - tackling the mountain of washing up that has accumulated throughout the day. But thanks to a new invention, the days of arduously cleaning plates and bowls might be over. Known as the Bake.A.Dish, the machine can make kitchenware out of bread that can hold all sorts of food from soup to curry. Is this the future of kitchenware? This odd kitchen gadget banishes the arduous chore of washing up after meals - because it bakes edible plates and bowls. The clever machine makes kitchenware out of bread using a top secret process that can hold any kind of food including soups and other liquid-based meals . The gadget can make bowls and plates of any size up to 16 inches (41 centimetres) in diameter. These can then be eaten at the end of a meal. Another device that could be set to alter the way people live is Luna. The Luna concept is a metallic sphere with a small amount of water in it that can turn your laundry basket into a washing machine. It creates a cloud of fine particles of steam electrostatically charged, which comes out through pores of the metal surface. It then rotates and moves between clothes through vibrations and pulses designed to scrub and shake tissues, loosening dirt. The . metallic surface of the sphere acts as a magnet: electrostatically . charged, it attracts dirt particles impregnated with steam and sucks . these towards the core of the sphere. Finally, Luna dries with hot air the residual damp in the tissues. The device can be controlled by a mobile phone app, which calculates the size of the bowl or plate according to how many calories the user needs. Bake.A.Dish is the work of industrial design student Saeed Rahiminejad. It is a contender for the Electrolux Design Lab 2014 awards, and the designer is now seeking funding to help put his concept into production. Rahiminejad, 26, from the Iranian capital Tehran, says: 'The product is aiming at personalising your dinnerware, making a more sustainable alternative to disposable dinnerware and adding a fix of fibre to one's daily diet. 'By customising the size of the food dishes according to one's special needs and adding a controlled amount of fibre and carbohydrates to the diet it promises a healthier eating lifestyle. 'You also get to eat hot, fresh baked goods whenever you want.' Rahiminejad added how a two part shape-shifting mold enables bowls and plates of differing sizes to be made. 'The possibilities are endless, and all you need is flour and water,' he continues. 'The . first thought that comes to mind about bread dinnerware is that they . couldn't possibly hold liquids and they're not that strong. 'But . I have a solution for making the bread hold any kind of food without a . worry, although I can't reveal it because it's secret. 'The . energy needed for making these breads comes from solar panels and the . water used for baking is less than that used to wash dishes. 'That makes Bake.A.Dish a good sustainable solution and ultimately is fun.' The machine can be controlled by a mobile phone app (shown here) that calculates the size of the bowl or plate according to how many calories the user needs. It can make bowls and plates of any size up to 16 inches (41 centimetres) in diameter which can then be eaten at the end of a meal .

"Forget everything you know about cake cutting; this new method could turn the seemingly straight-forward practice on its head. Although, using the word ‘new’ isn’t accurate, because the method is actually a 100-year-old trick unearthed by London-based author and mathematician Alex Bellos. In his latest YouTube video, Bellos describes how taking wedges out of cakes leaves them susceptible to drying - and we should instead be cutting them in lines so the whole cake can be sealed and stored. In a video for YouTube channel Numberphile, British mathematician Alex Bellos explained the best way to scientifically and mathematically cut a cake (shown). By cutting it in parallel lines, rather than in wedges the cake can more easily be stored without going dry, Bellos said . Known on YouTube as Numberphile, Bellos first explained the problems with modern methods of cutting cakes. Namely, he said that if a wedge is taken out of a cake but the rest of the food is then stored in the fridge, the edges of the cake open to the air will be ‘dry and horrible’, Bellos says. ‘You’re not maximising the amount of gastronomic pleasure that you can make from this cake.’ There is instead, he explained, a better way of cutting cakes that dates back more than a century. The method was first published in Nature on 20 December 1906 in the letters to the editor section by English mathematical scientist Francis Galton. Titled ‘Cutting a round cake on scientific principles’, Galton’s letter explained how the ‘ordinary method of cutting out a wedge is very faulty’. He went on . to state the cake should be cut in parallel lines, starting in the . centre, with the rectangular segments of the cake then taken out and . eaten. This would allow the cake to then be closed, provided it is one with icing, keep the sponge inside sealed and retaining its freshness. 'Christmas . suggests cakes, and the wish on my part [is] to describe a method of . cutting them that I have recently devised to my own amusement and . satisfaction. 'The . problem to be solved was, ""given a round tea-cake of some 5 inches . across, and two persons of moderate appetite to eat it, in what way . should it be cut so as to leave a minimum of exposed surface to become . dry?"" 'The ordinary method of cutting out a wedge is very faulty in thi s respect. The results to be aimed at are so to cut the cake that the remaining portions shall fit together. 'Consequently the chords (or the arcs) of the circumferences of these portions must be equal. 'The direction of the first . two vertical planes of section is unimportant; they may be parallel, as . in the first figure, or they may enclose a wedge. 'The . cuts shown on the figures represent those made with the intention of . letting the cake last for three days, each successive operation having . removed about one-thi rd of the area of the original disc. 'A common india-rubber band embraces the whole and keeps its segments together.' Stop, you're doing it all wrong! The 'new' method of cutting cakes was actually first described in a letter to the journal Nature on 20 December 1906. The modern method of cutting cakes into wedges has not seemingly been under much scrutiny, but perhaps this new technique will provide a useful alternative . It is also recommended an elastic band is used to hold the cake together and keep it sealed. ‘I don’t know if you’ve thought about it before but these triangular slices are really annoying anyway because it’s not very satisfying,’ Bellos added. In reference to the new method he said having ‘a nice uniform slice like that is a lot better.’ But, he concluded, most people choose to share their cakes rather than eating it themselves, meaning not much or any of it is often stored. ‘I think for the mathematical loners who don’t want to share their cakes it could be useful,’ he joked.","London mathematician Alex Bellos describes the trick in a YouTube video .

"Are Manchester United right to sack David Moyes? As David Moyes’s reign unravelled on Monday, tales emerged of senior Manchester United  players beating a path to the door of Sir Alex Ferguson’s Cheshire home to urge their old manager to push for change. The message was clear: they no longer stood by Moyes and neither should United if the empire Ferguson built was not going to continue crumbling, brick by brick. There was no more staunch a supporter of Moyes than his fellow Scot. After all, it was Ferguson who had called the Everton manager away from a shopping trip with his wife, Pamela, to that same address in Wilmslow to offer him the job last May when the ill-fated legend of ‘The Chosen One’ was born. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch David Moyes . Scot to trot: David Moyes tenure as United manager was ended after players complained to Fergie . Time's up! Sir Alex Ferguson played a major part in electing Moyes as his successor . SOS: United are desperate to return to winning ways after their worst season in Premier League history . ‘To be honest, it was done when Alex said but it was good for me to meet David and hear his ideas and plans,’ claimed United chief Ed Woodward in an interview last October, in what could now be seen as an attempt to distance himself from the appointment as the storm clouds gathered. ‘Without the recommendation of Alex there may have been a different process.’ Moyes reminded us of that episode last Friday, at what proved to be his final pre-match press conference, as he revisited the story of his departure from Everton. It was never going to be an easy transition. When Ferguson stood on the Old Trafford turf as United boss for the last time on that May day and urged supporters to back the new manager through good times and bad — even before his successor had been confirmed — he could see trouble ahead. It is a sign of just how much Ferguson is . revered that the fans obeyed him through the most wretched of seasons, . even when the banner dedicated to Moyes in the Stretford End became a . focal point of contention and then embarrassment and rebel planes . started circling overhead. Great expectations: Fergie addressed Old Trafford on his final game urging them to get behind the new man . Back in the day: Man United players want to see a return to the glory days they enjoyed under Ferguson . SIR ALEX FERGUSON, MAY 2013‘We’ve had bad times here. The club stood by me. All my staff stood by me. The players stood by me. So your job now is to stand by our new manager.’SIR BOBBY CHARLTON, MAY 2013‘We have secured a man who is committed to the long term and will build teams for the future as well as now.’SIR ALEX FERGUSON, OCT 2013‘David Moyes was at Everton for 10 years. There’s evidence that sticking with a manager does help.’ED WOODWARD, OCT 2013‘We don’t want the manager to be a hired gun for the next two or three years. We want the next generation to enjoy having him there creating his own legacy.’DAVID BECKHAM, FEB 2014‘I think David Moyes is a great manager, but it takes time. There’s a transitional period.’ROY KEANE, MARCH 2014‘I think David Moyes will get plenty of time. The man deserves it.’ They never forgot how Ferguson . survived and then thrived in the early Nineties and hoped Moyes would . somehow follow a similar road to redemption. Without their patience and . understanding, he would have been toast some time ago. But . when Ferguson himself became the target for their anger in recent . weeks, when Moyes openly questioned the squad that he had inherited, and . Ferguson’s final act as manager was suddenly threatening to taint all . that had gone before, enough was enough. As . if an increasingly bleak future under Moyes wasn’t bad enough, the . whole mess was in danger of casting a cloud over their glorious past. The comparisons with Sir Matt Busby and Wilf McGuinness 44 years ago have become quite uncanny. Moyes . is a good man, a proud man, and someone who hasn’t turned into a bad . coach overnight. But Ferguson cast a long shadow and it was one he never . came close to escaping. As . much as Moyes benefited from his predecessor’s support, there is no . doubt Ferguson’s achievements became a weight around his neck, his . presence a distraction. Selection policy: Moyes was coined 'The Chosen One' after his appointment headed by Ferguson . Sign of the times: Fans vented their frustration with a fly-by protest proclaiming Moyes the 'Wrong One' Moyes . insisted Ferguson was an occasional presence, always helpful but never . intrusive; that his aura around the club was not a problem. He may think . differently in hindsight. At . least McGuinness didn’t have to sit through every match at Old Trafford . facing a stand bearing the name of the legend he had replaced, while . modern television has enabled cameras to zoom in on Ferguson’s . expression every time Moyes suffered a setback — and there were far too . many of those for comfort . Every time another black mark appeared on his record, it was compared unfavourably with the man he replaced. Is it over yet? Fergie's visits to Old Trafford became less comfortable, with some fans even turning on him . A . post-mortem into United’s failings this season was never complete . without mention of how Moyes had done away with Ferguson’s entire . backroom team last summer. Ryan Giggs joined the coaching staff, a nod to the Ferguson dynasty, but his opinion was rarely sought and barely valued. Troubled times: Manchester United's 2-0 loss to Everton at the weekend was their 11th defeat of the season . Bad to worse: David Moyes has failed to live up to expectations at Old Trafford and has paid the price . Giggs . became an increasingly despondent figure and when two of Fergie’s . ‘Class of 92’,  Paul Scholes and Gary Neville, criticised Moyes’s team . and signings on television last month it was a sign the old guard were . in rebellion. Stalwarts of the Ferguson era, such as Nemanja Vidic and . Rio Ferdinand, had long since lost faith in Moyes. Robin . van Persie made it clear from the outset he was unhappy with the . change. Danny Welbeck, one of the bright young things Ferguson left . behind, now wants out. Others simply lost direction and heart. Singing from a different sheet? Ryan Giggs joined the coaching staff but was rarely asked for input . Sir Alex was aware of the unrest. His players made sure of that when they took the issue to his front door. Having . been so instrumental in Moyes’s appointment, it is unclear what part . Ferguson played in the decision to call time or how hard he fought . to save him when the Glazer family and Woodward lost patience. Ultimately, though, it was his legacy that stood to suffer from this whole sorry affair.","David Moyes sacked as Manchester United manager .

"Luis Suarez has made a conscious effort this past year to change the public perception of him, with the Liverpool striker keen to be seen as a role model rather than a bad boy. The 27-year-old’s image had reached an all-time low last summer, with the striker agitating for a move away from Anfield and serving a lengthy ban for biting Chelsea’s Branislav Ivanovic. Suarez, though, has managed to put the negative headlines behind him, netting 31 goals in a remarkable campaign in which he swept up the end-of-season awards. Up for the fight: Luis Suarez is battling to be fit for the World Cup following a knee injury . Furthermore, there has been a vastly improvement in the behaviour of the Uruguay international, currently attempting to recover from a knee injury in time for the World Cup. 'I want to change the bad boy image that has stuck for a bit because I don’t think I am at all how I have been portrayed,' Suarez told Sports Illustrated. 'I would like that to change because it’s awful to hear and read what is said of you. On the field, sometimes passion overwhelms you and you do things you regret afterward. 'At the same time, you have a chance to learn from those things. 'I think I [have] been a role model since last summer; I have been . professional, and I have the desire to forge ahead and play well . regardless of what is said to me.' Darker days: Suarez was slapped with a 10-game ban for biting Branislav Ivanovic last year . Asked if, like former NBA player Charles Barkley once suggested, athletes should not be role models, Suarez said: 'Of course they should be. Many times, [athletes’] attitudes are reflected in their performance on the field. 'I’ve had some attitudes on the field that weren’t very good for my image. But those weren’t really me-outside- the field, I’m very shy. 'I realised I had to adjust my attitude on the field, to continue to play well but without the bad attitude.' Prize guy: Suarez has rebuilt his reputation and scooped a string of awards this season . Part of that change has seen Suarez make more of an attempt to stay on his feet since moving to the Premier League - not that he thinks his reputation for diving his fair, anyway. 'How many yellow cards do I have for diving? I have a lot of yellow cards in my career, but most are for arguing, for fighting, for giving a -kicking-not for diving,' he added. 'Sometimes I fall, but it’s to get a penalty because I have been kicked.'

"More than two thirds of top-level managers across Europe want a winter break, a League Managers Association study has revealed. A number of head coaches from across the continent, covering 20 different nationalities, were polled and the proposition of a mid-season rest period won resounding favour. In another key finding the majority of managers would like the transfer window to remain open all season so signings can be made at any time. Give it a rest! Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has long been a vocal supporter of winter breaks . The results come in the Annual Castrol European Managers & Coaches Survey, which quizzes bosses on a variety of topics including the introduction of technology in football, which 93 per cent of respondents agreed was a positive step. But it is the clear backing for a winter break – 70 per cent are in favour – that could gain most traction and potentially force a change in Premier League scheduling. Arsene Wenger has long called for the move in English football and last April claimed German teams’ recent success was down to the Bundesliga operating a six-week pause between mid-December and late January. ‘When you are an English club or a Spanish club, you have a handicap - that is for sure,’ he said. Mesut Ozil was said to have suffered this season after a sparkling start to life in England because he was unable to rest midway through and fatigue set in. And most of the continent’s top coaches agree with Wenger. The other interesting development is that the majority of managers want an transfer window open all year long. Exhibit A: Mesut Ozil's dip in form towards the end of the season has been blamed on lack of rest . In agreement: Sam Allardyce (L) and Jose Mourinho would both support a season-long transfer window . Increasingly those in charge at Premier League clubs have bemoaned the summer and winter windows as unnecessarily prohibitive, claiming prices are pushed up, panic increases and agents prosper. Sam Allardyce and Jose Mourinho, two unlikely bedfellows, are in agreement on this issue. Other results of the survey found that 67 per cent of respondents considered the recruitment of players as becoming the most important part of the job and 73 per cent opposed the idea of the introduction of an orange card to be given to players with a yellow card as a ‘final warning’. Sir Alex Ferguson, an LMA board member, said the poll was important, while Carlo Ancelotti insisted the results should be listened to. ‘Football is a universal language and the collection of such information is invaluable,’ Ferguson said. Worth it: Former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson insists the LMA report contains important findings . ‘This survey covers leadership and management as well as other key technical issues in football so it deals with the issues that affect managers each and every day. ‘The findings of this survey are particularly intriguing and demonstrate the range of views across European football.’ Real Madrid manager Ancelotti added: ‘As the role of a manager and coach continues to evolve in the modern game it is vital that our views are not just collected but considered as, despite the range of models across Europe, the manager/head coach maintains responsibility for results.","Annual Castrol European Managers & Coaches Survey polled coaches covering 20 different nationalities .

"Arsene Wenger has revealed he was on the verge of signing Eden Hazard before Chelsea swooped in. The Arsenal boss said he had Hazard's agent discussing the deal at his home, but London rivals Chelsea's financial power won the battle for his signature from French side Lille. Hazard won the PFA Young Player of the Year after being nominated for the full award, which Liverpool talisman Luis Suarez won. Gunner-be? Eden Hazard, eluding Robert Snodgrass, was wanted by Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger . Asked about snapping up the Belgian, Wenger told BeIN Sports: 'Yes, I wanted to take him, I had his agent at my home but again the barrier was financial and Chelsea made an effort that I couldn't make. 'He can be one of the players who grows into the Messi, Ronaldo stature if he continues to develop well.' Wenger has still not signed a new deal at the Emirates with his current contract expiring at the end of the season. He revealed a he would consider a move to Germany if he was to leave the Gunners in the future. Overseas? Arsene Wenger hinted at a desire to manage in Germany at some point in the future . 'If I was to go somewhere then I think it would be in a different country because I am so much Arsenal that I would not like to coach anywhere else in England,' he said.

"Cardiff City chairman Mehmet Dalman has warned clubs interested in Gary Medel that they will not sell their £10million record signing at a loss. Medel is expected to leave the relegated club after the World Cup, with Valencia leading a group of La Liga sides interested in the midfielder. The Chilean is understood to have a release clause in his contract which approximately matches the fee Cardiff paid Sevilla last summer - a fee that started at £10million, but featured significant additional payments. Cardiff's record signing Gary Medel celebrates Chile's first goal against Spain . Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has previously said Medel ‘deserves to be playing at a higher level than the Championship’ and the 26-year-old’s impressive performances at the World Cup have supported those claims after a mediocre season in Wales. But Dalman insists no offers have been received and strongly indicated that Medel will not be allowed to leave for less than the record fee Cardiff paid. He said: ‘After what he’s been doing out in Brazil, there may well be a few offers on the table at the end of the tournament. ‘If so, and Gary comes to me and says he wishes to leave, I will engage in those discussions then. In demand: Medel (right) is being courted by a number of sides in La Liga . ‘But even if that were to be the case, I think it’s fair to say I’m not known as a pushover in negotiations. I’m not in the habit of selling anything at a loss.’ Sportsmail revealed in December the sizeable outlay of Medel’s signing, with his initial £10m fee possibly rising to £15m dependant on clauses. There was also an agent’s fee of £800,000, a signing-on fee of £1.25m, an image-rights fee of £1.6m for a player who rarely gives interviews, and a weekly basic wage of £35,000. Dalman added: ‘I hope that once this tournament is over, he will choose to stick around and help us try to regain our place in the Premier League. I’ve had no indication whatsoever from Gary that he may want to go. Cardiff chairman Mehmet Dalman wants at least £10million for Medel . Cardiff boss Solskjaer has said that Medel should be playing at a higher level than the Championship . ‘People may say that Gary is too good for the Championship. But then we’ve got lots of players who are good enough to play in the Premier League. ‘I’ve no doubts that after what Gary has been doing in this World Cup, there will be interested parties out there. ‘But he is under contract to Cardiff City and sometimes it’s not necessarily about the league you play in, it’s about the club you play for and their ambition. ‘We’ve made six summer signings already and have set out our stall to try to regain instant promotion.’","Valencia are interested in Cardiff City's £10million midfielder .

"Luis Suarez’s future at Liverpool took a twist when his father-in-law declared the time is right for him to leave the club.

There is a belief that he still has a lot to offer and represents something of a coup for Jardim. Croatian Danijel Subasic was the No 1 at Stade Louis II last season and would remain so until Valdes' knee healed fully.

"Liverpool have completed the £9.8m transfer of Emre Can from Bayer Leverkusen. The Reds agreed a deal in principle for the versatile midfielder last month, and the necessary documentation has now been finalised. Can becomes Liverpool's third signing of the summer, following the capture of Rickie Lambert and Adam Lallana from Southampton.VIDEO Scroll down for Emre Can: I'm glad to be part of the Liverpool family . Done deal: Liverpool have confirmed the signing of Bayer Leverkusen's Emre Can . New home: Can posing outside Liverpool's Melwood training ground . VIDEO I want to be a Premier League champion - Can . Signal of intent: Manager Brendan Rodgers has been busy trying to sort incomings out early on for next year . Upon sealing the switch to Anfield, . the 20-year-old told the club website: 'I am proud to be a part of the family and I am . looking forward to playing here. I will give it my best. 'LFC . is a great club and the fans are amongst the best in the world. I am . looking forward to the first game and can't wait to step on the pitch . for the first time at Anfield. 'I want to thank the manager for trusting me and allowing me to play here. I am proud to be a part of the family and I am looking forward to playing here. 'It was an easy decision for me to sign with Liverpool as I had a very good chat with the manager, which clearly shows that he and the club wanted to sign me. 'I want to give it my best and help the team as much as I can. I believe this season the team finished second in the league, so i want to be a Premier League champion next season.' He also discussed his ambition to play in the Champions League, signalling that it was a key factor behind his decision to move, adding: 'Playing in the Champions League is a dream come true for every footballer. 'I have a total of seven appearances now and these sort of matches are not comparable to any other games. 'I hope we will progress as far as we can and I am looking to compete against the best teams in Europe. I believe we will play a good role in next year's competition.' Ambition: Can is hoping to make a big impact in next season's Champions League . The boot room: He has spoken of his enthusiasm at playing for the club . Can . made 29 Bundesliga appearances last season, scoring three goals for . Leverkusen, in addition to seven Champions League run-outs. And . Brendan Rodgers is delighted to have brought him to the club, telling . Liverpoolfc.com: 'Emre is an exciting young talent and I'm delighted . he's chosen Liverpool for the next phase of his development and growth . as a player.' 'He has . recognised that we are a club that improves and nurtures exciting, . ambitious players and I'm looking forward to seeing him take those next . steps forward for us. 'We . have tracked his progress for some time and I have been impressed with . his attitude and qualities when I have seen him play both in the German . Bundesliga and the Champions League. 'He has many of the attributes we look for; charisma on the football pitch and courage to want the ball and make things happen.' Can was one of the most versatile young players in the Bundesliga. Having spent most of his career so far in the youth set up at Bayern Munich, the Frankfurt-born player was one pipped for the top from an extremely early age. After only four first-team appearances at Bayern, though, Can's star faded during the 2012/13 season, and so in the summer of 2013 he chose to make the switch to Leverkusen. It has done him a world of good, and he has developed into an invaluable midfield force for his new club. He has also represented Germany at every level from Under 15 to Under 21. Can prefers to play in central midfield - 'either attacking or defending, I don't care either way' - but has been employed as a centre-back and a left-back on various occasions. As captain of the German Under 17s team, he was the calming influence at the heart of play. His physical strength is of particular use going forward, though he is rarely overly reckless. It has been remarked on several occasions that Can seems to have a maturity beyond his years, and his technical ability as a playmaker, either from the back or the front, is now beyond doubt. The most commonly drawn comparison is Bastian Schweinsteiger. And not only because the young Can puts as much effort into his hairstye as Schweinsteiger once did. His ability to switch effortlessly from defence to midfield, his dangerous shot, and his control over the pace of the game all do remind one of the established Bayern star. For those watching his marauding runs through the centre at Leverkusen this season though, Toni Kroos has always also sprung to mind. It is little surprise that these two Bayern stars have had an influence on Can's play. He has trained with them, or at least in close proximity to them, for several of his formative years.

"There is much upset at Wimbledon about rights-holders BBC paying Andy Murray for a regular online column. The tax-payer-funded Beeb are understood to be giving multi-millionaire Murray £400 a time for his digital contribution, despite having exclusive TV access to him with an interview straight after every match. Murray’s over-the-top BBC commitments, added to his recovery routine, make his after-match duties unnecessarily complicated. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Murray and Mauresmo play mixed doubles before Anderson match . Causing a stir: The BBC are paying Andy Murray £400 a day to contribute to an online Wimbledon column . Don't mention the hairdryer! An Alex Ferguson line of questioning has seen Garry Richardson fall out of favour . BBC children’s glove puppet Hacker The Dog has had more of Murray’s time than many journalists. A BBC spokeswoman said: ‘We do pay Andy for his BBC Sport column which gives exclusive insight into his thoughts during Wimbledon —something which we’re sure is of great interest to readers of the website. Payment for columns or blogs is standard practice.’ Meanwhile, it is noticeable that BBC veteran Garry Richardson is not doing as many post-match Murray interviews. The Scot was infuriated by Richardson asking whether he would be receiving a Sir Alex Ferguson-style hair-dryer from coach Ivan Lendl after coming back from two sets down to beat Fernando Verdasco last year, in a match watched by the former Manchester United manager. Richardson later apologised for his dire questioning. Murray’s camp say they have made no requests about who does the interview, but Richardson has only been in the role once. A BBC spokeswoman said the choice of interviewer depended on who was available at the time. ................................................................................................... Ivan Lendl’s tennis earnings might have dipped since he stopped coaching Andy Murray but not by as much as the £15million asking price for his Greenwich, Connecticut, mansion with equestrian facilities, indoor basketball court and multi-storey guest rooms. Lendl spends most of his time at his other home in Florida playing golf. .................................................................................................... All England Club members are baffled about dictatorial chairman Philip Brook  insisting that players adhere to the strict white-only clothing policy during the tournament when members are allowed a lot more freedom over kit colours. Wimbledon counter that club matches are not televised. .................................................................................................... The online secondary ticket market presented a major problem to Wimbledon last year, with seats being traded and both purchasers and vendors oblivious to regulations that only allow the official  re-selling of debentures. But a crackdown by Wimbledon has seen the issue kept under control with no sign of Championship tickets being re-sold by the usual suspects. Grigor Dimitrov, Wednesday’s quarter-final opponent for Andy Murray, faces conflict-of-interest issues after joining the agency that Roger Federer set up to look after himself. Contrast of interests? Grigor Dimitrov has joined Roger Federer's management Team8 . Federer left IMG along with his agent Tony Godsick to run their own athlete management operation Team8, which now represents Dimitrov. But it will cause complications, for instance, if Federer plays Dimitrov for a place in the top-eight ATP Tour Finals when one of them has already qualified. Godsick has said Federer will play no part in the business until the end of his tennis career. Sleeping with the enemy? Judy Murray is working with the LTA to encourage young girls to play tennis .

"He may be out of the Wimbledon championships – but the reasons for Andy Murray’ s four-letter outbursts during his humiliating defeat by Grigor Dimitrov were still being feverishly discussed on Thursday.Did a row with his girlfriend Kim Sears a few minutes before play prompt him to turn towards the players’ box and shout incredulously: ‘Five minutes before the f***ing match?’ Had there been a disagreement with his new coach Amelie Mauresmo? And who was the target of his ‘Shut the f*** up!’ attack, which he screamed in the direction of Miss Sears, Miss Mauresmo and his mother Judy Murray? Here – as Murray prepares to return to . training in Miami – the Daily Mail examines speculation surrounding his . flare-up and names the main suspects. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Fans react to Andy Murray's shock knockout at Wimbledon . Anger: Andy Murray was out of sorts on Wednesday against Grigor Dimitrov, he was knocked out in straight sets . Saddening: Murray's girlfriend Kim Sears watches on as the Bulgarian beats the Scot on Centre Court . KIM SEARS: The story of Murray’s defeat was chronicled blow by blow in the facial expressions of his loyal girlfriend Kim Sears. Occasionally she appeared to offer advice beyond the standard ‘Come on Andy!’, preferred by much of the Centre Court crowd. Fact: They didn’t leave together after the match – Andy jumped in an All England Club courtesy car immediately after his post-match press conference and had not changed out of his kit. Their separate departures would not normally be cause for speculation but Miss Sears did accompany him after his 2012 defeat by Roger Federer – and on Wednesday was said to have been ‘looking upset’ when she left without him. Wicked internet speculation that she had chosen five minutes before the big match to dump him/tell him she was pregnant/say she had always liked Roger cannot be substantiated. But the breaking news on Thursday night was that Miss Sears had accidentally let slip the ending of a box-set TV series they had been watching. On Thursday his grandfather Roy Erskine, 82, said of the ‘five-minutes’ mystery: ‘Normally he’ll be alone in his dressing room so I have no idea what could possibly have gone wrong.’ Seperate exits: Sears and Murray left SW19 by themselves on Wednesday . Falling out? Rumours were spreading fast on social media after the defeat . VIDEO Murray joins Nadal in early exit . AMELIE MAURESMO: The French former world number one started coaching Murray after he lost in the semi-finals of the French Open last month.Recently when asked about their professional partnership, she volunteered that things were getting ‘smoother and smoother’ perhaps implying there was a time when they were less so. Fact: Miss Mauresmo was seen sprinting up the stairs to the competitors’ box just moments before Murray came on to court to face Dimitrov. Did she tell him to change his strategy? Might she have clashed with him over tactics? Was something she said playing on Murray’s brooding mind? On Thursday a track-suited Murray arrived at her flat near the ground for a pre-arranged meeting. He was carrying what appeared to be a card in an envelope with a single name written on it. Cards declaring ‘Sorry I Told You to Shut The F*** Up’ are not widely available – but in any case, it is Amelie’s 35th birthday on Saturday. The pair spent more than two hours inside before Andy left alone. But conspiracy theories which suggested coach and player were about to separate amid some unspecified acrimony fell flat when he failed to stomp out in a strop. Birthday wishes? Andy Murray seemed to be posting a card to Amelie Mauresmo on Thursday . Keeping calm: The pair had a lengthy chat... it is unclear whether Mauresmo will continue as coach . Error: Mauresmo looks glum on Centre Court as Murray crashes out in the quarter-finals . VIDEO Murray trains with Mauresmo . JUDY MURRAY: Andy’s mother and long-time former coach remains a constant presence. Except, that is, for some possibly critical minutes on Wednesday at the start of the match. Fact: Mrs Murray was at court 18 to cheer her other son, Jamie, to victory in his mixed doubles opener with Australian Casey Dellacqua.  Little brother Andy had already lost the first set by the time she arrived. Last week Andy joked he was ‘the number two son’, and that his family seemed to spend a great deal of time watching the number one. Another theory: Was Mrs Murray shouting advice that contradicted Murray’s coach?  Perhaps. But even for a grumpy Scot in a foul mood, it is surely beyond the realms of possibility that he would tell his own mother to ‘shut the f*** up’. Afterwards she stressed she knew of nothing that might have upset him. Difference of opinion: Was Judy Murray shouting advice that contradicted Mauresmo's? MAGGIE MAY: The couple’s beloved border terrier, named after the Rod Stewart hit, has previously used Twitter throughout her master’s Wimbledon appearances. This year she has not tweeted even a bark. Has she been unwell? Fact: Four years ago Mrs Murray revealed Andy was ‘worried sick’ throughout the tournament after Maggie fell ill. THE BANANA: Murray has previously relied on bananas for their energy-giving qualities. Fact: On the advice of a nutritionist, he cut back on bananas last year – and won Wimbledon. This year he admitted he was back on them – and lost.FATE: Play began on Centre Court at noon rather than the usual time of 1pm. Murray’s early start led to suggestions afterwards that he he was not mentally prepared for his game.  Was he given only five minutes’ notice of the change? Murray dismissed the speculation in his BBC blog, declaring: ‘There was nothing different in the build-up, and no reason to expect that kind of performance.’   ANDY MURRAY: Perhaps the player himself is the only real suspect. Could it simply be that he lost? It is the only theory he publicly supports. ‘Yeah,’ said Murray. I certainly lost the match, yeah.’ Pushing himself? Or maybe, the disastrous performance was all down to Murray himself?","Murray crashed out of Wimbledon after defeat to Grigor Dimitrov .

"Joe Hart needs to have an outstanding World Cup to be rated alongside Italy counterpart Gianluigi Buffon as one of the planet's best goalkeepers, according to Peter Shilton. The former Three Lions keeper believes current No 1 Hart is yet to prove himself at the highest level, despite Wayne Rooney and Arsenal's Wojciech Szczesny claiming that the Manchester City man is the already the most talented stopper in world football. Shilton concedes that the 27-year-old is full of natural ability, but insists he must enjoy a strong tournament for Roy Hodgson's side in Brazil in order to move to the next level. VIDEO Scroll down for: Joe Hart stars in epic football skills video with freestylers F2 . Room for improvement: Former England keeper Peter Shilton believes Joe Hart still needs to prove himself at the highest level . Preparation: Hart pulls off a save in training at the Arena da Amazonia ahead of England's game with Italy . Speaking exclusively to Sportsmail, Shilton said: 'The World Cup will be his acid test. If he has a tremendous tournament then he'll be rated as one of the best in the world but he's still got it all to do. 'Some players have described him as the best in the world but that's premature. He proved he's still got a lot to learn after his problems at Manchester City last season. 'He's got a lot of natural ability but there's still plenty for him to work on and improve.' Hart came under criticism for his club performances during the opening months of last season and was subsequently dropped for seven consecutive Premier League games by boss Manuel Pellegrini. He regained his place in the starting XI in December and played every remaining game as City overcame Liverpool and Chelsea to win their second league title in three years. Despite Hart's upturn in form in the latter stages of last season, England's most capped player admits to being surprised by the number of high-profile mistakes made by the former Shrewsbury starlet. Shilton said: 'It really surprised me when he lost his . form earlier in the season. Big mistake: This error by Hart allowed Fernando Torres to score a late winner for Chelsea against Manchester City last season . Experienced: England's record cap holder Shilton was speaking at Betfair's #PerfectPenalty masterclass . 'That never happened to me. I didn't ever . have a really bad spell. I had a game I wanted to forget on the odd . occasion, but never more than that. 'He's . a confident guy and that helps seep into the defence. But at the same . time, he knows that one mistake could live with him for the rest of his . life. We've seen it before with David Seaman, Peter Bonetti and Rob . Green. 'Joe is still young and this is a big opportunity for him. His reputation will improve if he has a good tournament.' Hart will come up against Mario Balotelli and Italy in the heat of Manaus on Saturday as England kick-off their Group D campaign against the team who eliminated them from Euro 2012 on penalties. And while . Hart will be focusing on the attacking talent at the disposal of Cesare . Prandelli, Shilton believes he should be aiming emulate the man in . between the sticks at the opposite end. Asked . who the best goalkeeper on show will be at the World Cup, the . ex-Leicester and Nottingham Forest keeper doesn't hesitate. 'Gianluigi . Buffon,' he replies immediately. Super stopper: Gianluigi Buffon (centre) is the No 1 keeper in world football, according to Shilton . Eye on the ball: Buffon is set to line up opposite Hart in Manaus on Saturday night . 'He has always been a very solid goalkeeper technically and he's capable of making great saves. He's obviously not getting any younger, but he'll be very difficult to beat when England play Italy.' Shilton also rates Spain's Iker Casillas highly and picks out Germany's Manuel Neuer as one to watch too. But neither are given the same praise as the Juventus legend. If he finds his best form Brazil, Hart might just have a chance of joining Buffon in Shilton's - and many other people's - list of greats.

"Forget a lock of hair or a hand print, the new way to remember your newborn is with jewellery made from breast milk. Designed by mother-of-three Allicia Mogavero founder of Mommy Milk Creations, the bizarre keepsakes encase the mother's milk in a variety of pendants, rings and bracelets. Alicia enjoyed breastfeeding her child so much that she wanted to find a way to preserve and commemorate that magic - and so her company Mommy Milk Creations was born. An inventive mother from Rhode Island has created a selection of jewellery using breast milk . Alicia, in her early 30s, captures what she believes to be an awe-inspiring moment with a secret preservation technique that solidifies the milk in the special resin. The process has taken the artist seven years to perfect. On receiving a breast milk sample, Alicia 'plasticizes' it, then moulds it into miniature shapes such as hearts, moons, stars or tiny feet and hands. Alicia's creations have become so sought after that there is currently a 12 month waiting list . The 'milk bead' is then set in clear resin and silver hooks and chains are added. The child's name or a special message can also be included. Each piece takes her around five hours to make and prices reach around $160 (£97) for a personalised sterling silver locket. The entrepreneur has had so many requests that she has found it hard to keep up  with the demand. Orders have backed up so much that there is currently a 12-month waiting list. Alicia from Rhode Island, receives orders from mothers all over the world, from countries such as the UK, Belgium, Germany, Australia, Spain, Italy and China. However, her novel creations having caused heated debate. 'I've heard it all when it comes to comments about my items' she says. '""What's next, a baby's first poop keepsake?"" or ""that is disgusting, breast milk is body fluid.""' Alicia has not been deterred by the comments she's received and says that she is not alone in thinking her creations are beautiful. 'I think breast milk is truly amazing and I'm certainly not the only one who thinks this way.' For Alicia, preserving her breast milk was especially important as she had experienced many difficulties when feeding her son. Alicia started her business after creating herself a bracelet from her own breast milk . It has taken Alicia seven years to perfect the process of preserving breast milk . 'I had a lot of issues and complications with breastfeeding him, he was tongued tied, had a recessed chin and I unknowingly had flat nipples. 'I would be up in the middle of the night trying to get my son to latch on for hours at a time, it was exhausting and one of the hardest things I've ever done in my life.' She says that conquering that struggle was something that she was proud of and wanted to preserve. Alicia's creations have also been met with criticism with people calling her creations 'gross' 'Those difficulties, the bond with my son and the satisfaction with myself for fighting through was truly a profound experience for me. 'What was so amazing to me was that I could make milk and completely nourish this baby, it was all he needed and that was absolutely amazing to me. 'Something my body makes that I provide with love has my child all plump and happy, it was amazing.' It was after creating herself a unique piece of jewellery that turned the business-minded mother's dream into a money-spinner. 'I made myself a bracelet and started making them for family members with their breast milk, word-of-mouth requests started coming in - and the rest is history.' Alicia has revived orders from the UK, Belgium, Germany, Australia, Spain, Italy and China.","Alicia Mogavero is the founder of Mommy Milk Creations .

"Mats Hummels denied speculation he will move to Manchester United this summer after scoring in Germany's 4-0 thumping of Portugal at the World Cup. The Borussia Dortmund centre-half has been linked with a move to Old Trafford to join Louis Van Gaal's revolution at the deposed Barclays Premier League champions. Hummels scored the second goal, heading a Toni Kroos corner past Portugal goalkeeper Patricio, as Germany sent out a strong statement of intent in Salvador. Heading for victory: Mats Hummels (left) celebrates with Benedikt Howedes after scoring Germany's second goal in the 4-0 rout of Portugal . Towering: Hummels rises above the Portugal defenders Bruno Alves and Pepe to head home a corner from Toni Kroos . Asked afterwards about a possible move to United, the 25-year-old said: 'I never think about that or talk about that because it is something that isn't important for me right now. 'Maybe it will be someday, but I don't expect it to be link that this summer.' Hummels went down late on with a knee injury but is confident he will be fit for Germany's second group game against Ghana on Saturday night. 'It's not a problem. It will take a bit of ice, but it is ok,' he said. 'I just had a cramp in my calf before I did it, but I hope it is just a bruise that will be ok in 2-3 days.' Injury scare: Hummels went off late on with a knee problem but says he will be fit and ready for Germany's next match against Ghana on Saturday . Struggling: Hummels is helped off the pitch by Germany's medical team as Sami Khedira takes a drink . Thomas Muller started his campaign to retain the Golden Boot in style with a hat-trick but Hummels' header came at a crucial time. He said: 'Yes, it was very important for us. It is very nice to score in a World Cup because it is something you dream of as a child. It was a great moment for me. 'It can be very big for us because we know what we can do if we play like we did today. 'if we are concentrated and focused, both defensively and offensively, then we are a good team and that is the way we play. 'If we can do that in every game, we are going to have a good chance to be very successful.' Transfer target: Hummels has been linked with a move to Manchester United when Louis van Gaal takes over at Old Trafford after the World Cup . Hat-trick hero: Thomas Muller scored three of Germany's goals in the emphatic 4-0 win in Salvador . Brazil and Argentina remain the fancied teams to lift the World Cup on July 13, but Germany laid down a marker with their dominant display. Asked whether they can become the first European team to win the tournament in South America, Hummels said: 'Yes, the thing is to work as a team. 'If we work defensively as we should, then our attacking play is so good that we have a chance to beat every team. That is for sure. 'But the same counts for Spain, Brazil and the Netherlands, so it will be very tough to win this tournament. 'We have to be very good to win the World Cup, winning five or six games, and if you have one bad day, then the World Cup is over.'","Borussia Dortmund centre-back linked with move to Old Trafford .

"It remains an ugly stain on a beautiful, pristine career, the night Cristiano Ronaldo erred at the moment of his country’s greatest need. Donetsk in Ukraine on a steamy June night and Portugal exited the 2012 European Championship in the semi-finals on penalties to Spain. Incredibly, Ronaldo didn’t take a kick. Due to take his country’s final penalty, the contest never got that far. Subsequently, inevitable questions were asked of his mental stature. Did the self-proclaimed world’s best player really hide at the back of the line? When the dust settled, Ronaldo claimed Portugal were not allowed to change the order of takers they had submitted to the match referee. There is no mention of that, however, in UEFA’s rules. Whatever the truth, he merely watched — hands on hips — as defenders missed penalties in front of him, and then he sat and cried on the pitch. VIDEO Scroll down to watch a female pitch invader retrained after running towards Ronaldo . He's got the whole world in his hands: Cristiano Ronaldo gets ready to make his entrance at this year's tournament . Hitting the heights: Ronaldo, pictured in training, is Portugal's one and only chance of success at the World Cup . Above criticism: Ronaldo (centre) is a hero in Portugal and is looking to get his World Cup up and running . No wonder, then, that the Ballon d’Or winner drove his country so forcefully and brilliantly through qualification for this World Cup. As he scored four times in the group phase and then destroyed Sweden with a play-off hat-trick, perhaps he had redemption on his mind. That night in Stockholm last November he was at his imperious best. It was a stunning individual display, a lethal mixture of arrogance and supreme desire. It gave credence to the theory that a fit and firing Ronaldo here in Brazil could drag Portugal to unimagined places almost on his own. Certainly that is the way that the Portuguese see it. In his home country, they recognise Ronaldo for exactly what he is. He is their one and only chance here. Without him they are a very modest group of players. With him, they immediately step up at least two levels. That is why that night in the east of Ukraine two years has been forgotten in his home country. That is why they pray his troublesome groin allows him to pay freely against Germany in Group G in  Salvador on Monday. Paying the penalty: Ronaldo did not take a kick in Portugal's Euro 2012 shootout elimination . 51 - The number of goals scored by Ronaldo for Real Madrid last season, including 17 in the Champions League . ‘There was never any need for him to make anything up to us,’ said one Portuguese commentator recently. ‘What happened in Ukraine was unfortunate but we don’t blame him. We don’t think he ducked that penalty. ‘He is all we have. He never has a need to apologise, no matter what he does or doesn’t do.’ It’s certainly the case that, in Portugal, Ronaldo is not the type of hero who is continually asked to prove himself. He has 49 goals from 111 caps and his place in the national consciousness is secure. In England, we argue today about Wayne Rooney’s international future. Over the weekend, England captain Steven Gerrard has received criticism, too. That simply doesn’t happen to Ronaldo, even on the occasions — that are not so rare — when he appears to treat the Portuguese team merely as a showcase for his individual gifts. On Monday night, Germany will know that the Real Madrid forward is pretty much all that stands between them and their usual steady start to a major tournament. They will know also that Ronaldo didn’t actually finish his season with Madrid in particularly good form. Stunning: Ronaldo celebrates his first of three goals in the play-off against Sweden when he was at his imperious, arrogant best and dragged Portugal to the World Cup . Ronaldo may have contributed the final act of last month’s Champions League final — scoring from the penalty spot in added time of extra-time — but his overall performance on the night was fitful. At times he looked rather tired. Winger and a prayer: Portugal fans will hope Ronaldo has recovered from his injury in time to face Germany . Fabio Coentrao, a team-mate for club and country, said last night: ‘Cristiano is a very important player for us. He’s the best in the world. He’s a super-athlete, but he had a very exhausting season. ‘There is no doubt that all the games he played with us have taken a toll on him, physically and mentally. However, he has a tremendous will of helping the national team. He cares so much. We hope that will carry him through.’ Testimonies and tributes to Ronaldo’s importance and  brilliance have characterised Portugal’s lead-up to Brazil 2014. Portuguese journalists laugh at themselves as they admit that, at times, he is all they ever ask coach Paulo Bento about. Prior to Monday night’s game, Silvestre Varela has been quoted as  saying he would happily give up his own place in Bento’s squad if it helped to guarantee Ronaldo’s fitness. ‘A World Cup without him is not a World Cup,’ said the Porto winger. Sporting Lisbon’s sought-after holding player William Carvalho, meanwhile, has described Ronaldo as an ‘inspiration’. Only Bento himself has attempted to place some sort of cap on the expectation that inevitably envelopes his team whenever Ronaldo is in it. ‘We must deal with the pressure from outside,’ said Bento on Sunday night. ‘The fact that we have the best player in the world doesn’t force us to be world champions.’ Put your shirt on him: Ronaldo is delighted after his penalty in the Champions League final . Ronaldo was probably born a decade or so too late to have any real chance of winning something with his country. He contributed to Portugal’s narrow failure on home turf in Euro 2004 but, at 19, was not the player then that he is now. The fabled golden generation of Luis Figo and Rui Costa may not ultimately have underachieved had Ronaldo been in their midst. Certainly the players Bento has to choose from now do not compare. Ronaldo has perhaps two World Cups left in him and this one finds him where he has always wished to be — recognised as the best in his sport. On Sunday night, Lionel Messi stepped out for Argentina but this time he does not hold star billing. Ronaldo will have that. The kid from Madeira is the centrepiece of this year’s World Cup. He has reason enough to make sure he adorns it with his unique form of dazzling brilliance.","Ronaldo didn't take a spot-kick as Portugal went out two years ago .

"Louis van Gaal has been showing his softer side this World Cup by allowing his Holland stars to take time out their busy schedule to spend time with their WAGs. The Dutch face Costa Rica in their quarter-final on Saturday, but that did not stop them from being given some time off to relax with their partners on Tuesday afternoon. Leroy Fer and Jasper Cillessen were both photographed out-and-about with their other halves, while Robin van Persie, Nigel de Jongh and Co kept the fans happy by signing some autographs.

The forward openly admitted trying to con the referee and eventually won the defining penalty in the 93rd minute.

"Out with a wave and a whimper they went. Out without the slightest echo of Fabio Capello raging against the injustice of a disallowed goal. Or the sense of crushing disappointment following the penalties against Portugal that marked the end of Sven Goran Eriksson’s tenure and prompted David Beckham to quit the England captaincy in tears. During a spell in charge that almost now feels like a golden era for the England team, Eriksson had even led Brazil at the quarter-final stage four years earlier, only to then lose to a Ronaldinho lob that had David Seaman blubbing, too.

Tough to watch: Roy Hodgson stares at the ground alongside Ray Lewington and Gary Neville in the England dug-out . Halcyon days: England players look dejected after Ronaldinho's effort put Brazil 2-1 up in Shizuoka . Four years prior to that and it was Argentina on penalties, but only after that marvellous Michael Owen goal and the drama of Beckham’s dismissal. It was petulant. It had Glenn Hoddle raging at a young player for undermining what had been a fine England performance. But at least England went down fighting. At least they played with a bit of style and vigour. Here? There was nothing like that. There was just this sense of meek surrender. A sense that England had come to the greatest World Cup in history and pretty much stunk the place out. Roy Hodgson tried to give this encounter with Costa Rica some meaning, standing as he did in the dug-out for the entire match. He certainly acted as if it mattered. But if this was the first step towards a brighter future, the first step away from the nadir that was defeat by Uruguay, then why end the game with Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard in midfield? Greg Dyke, misguided though he was in the timing of his comments, said these matches here in Brazil would prove valuable experience for Euro 2016. Game-changer: Kim Milton Neilsen gives David Beckham his marching orders . Time old conundrum: England ended up with Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard in midfield . But what value, beyond sentiment, could there be in reuniting Gerrard and Lampard for 17 minutes when their failure to operate effectively as a partnership has been a source of frustration for more than a decade? ‘We need to improve, otherwise we would not be going home,’ said Lampard afterwards. ‘It is about the future and looking for them to get better.’ Well, quite. Hodgson may take comfort in the reception he and his players received from England’s fans at the end. But he shouldn’t kid himself into thinking it was an acceptance of failure. It was actually rather surreal; a response, you suspect, driven almost by pity. Nobody can claim it was anything other than a pitiful effort over the three matches, with this performance providing further evidence that Hodgson fails as an international manager where others succeed. Hollow applause: England's performance at the World Cup has been a disaster . Down and out: England players applaud their fans after ending their World Cup in the group stage . Louis van Gaal turned a dodgy Dutch defence against Australia into a superbly disciplined one against Chile. Here, England still looked vulnerable to long balls. Lampard seized on the positives. ‘It was amazing,’ he said of the reception they received at the end from the fans. ‘They were singing for the manager. It made you proud to be an Englishman. It makes you feel a bit bad we have not given them a longer stay.’ Lampard also said such support would help the younger players in the future. But they need more than that. They need leadership and guidance and a clear vision of how they should play. They need to know that this will never happen again. That the people in charge, the people in the highest offices at the FA, implement the changes to make damn sure it doesn’t happen again. Whether they will, of course, is another question entirely.","England went down fighting at previous World Cups .

"The Argentina squad look eager for a World Cup final against Brazil after they sang about how the host nation are being 'bossed around' and have been 'crying since Italy' World Cup 1990. The footage shows Argentinian players and officials jumping on top of benches, swinging shirts and chanting after their 1-0 win over Switzerland in extra time to make the quarter-finals. Brazil and Argentina are favourites to win the tournament with Coral and, if the two are to meet, it will have to be in the World Cup final at the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro on June 13.

Maradona is greater than Pele' The chant, sang passionately by Argentina's camp, won't be music to Brazil's ears, however. They remind the host nation how Diego Maradona 'out-skilled' them, how Claudio Caniggia 'surprised' and how Argentina knocked Brazil out in the 1990 tournament. The worst insult, though, may be that they insist 'Maradona is greater than Pele'. Argentina, although deliriously happy in their changing room on Tuesday, must gather themselves for their next task on Saturday. They left it late for Angel Di Maria to see them through with just two minutes of the added 30 to go against Switzerland, but Belgium stand in their way of making the final four.

"Holidaymakers in Phuket, Koh Samiu and Pattaya can go out freely after Thailand's military junta lifted the popular beach resorts. But the restriction, imposed following the May 22 coup d'etat, will remain in place across the rest of the country, including in the capital Bangkok. The decision to end to curfew was a bid to promote tourism, but the latest statistics show that global interest in Thailand as a holiday destination has dropped 26 per cent following the coup. Beach break: The three popular resorts of Phuket, Koh Samui and Pattaya have had their curfews lifted . In a televised announcement, the junta said it was ending the curfew 'to promote tourism and to relieve the impact from the curfew in areas that are peaceful and free from political protests.' The curfew was initially introduced nationwide from 10pm until 5am, drawing complaints from the country's vital tourism industry, which accounts for about seven per cent of Thailand's economy. Last week, the junta eased the nationwide curfew to the hours of midnight until 4am. The ongoing political turbulence, which has seen disruptive and sometimes violent protests in Bangkok since November last year, has caused a significant drop in tourism. Contrast in the capital: Soldiers remain on the streets in Bangkok, despite the relaxation of restrictions at beach resorts . And the further drop in holiday bookings has been reported by holiday website trivago.com, comparing search figures for the week prior to the coup and the week following the military takeover. Despite no reports of violence and reassurances that holidaymakers are not in danger, trivago found that worldwide searches dropped 26 per cent, with British holidaymakers search 24 per cent less than they were the week previously. Tuesday's announcement from the military said the curfew would stay in effect for the rest of the country 'until further notice.' Thailand's tourism industry has been resilient despite nearly a decade of political turbulence, with a record 26.7 million visitors last year. Life goes on: Despite the political upheaval, holidaymakers have reported little or no disruption in key tourist hotspots . But tour operators, restaurant owners and hotels have complained that the combination of coup plus curfew was leading to excessive cancellations. More than 50 countries have issued travel alerts, advising citizens to steer clear of protests in Bangkok. But many tourists have tweeted pictures from the country's resorts showing peaceful, unaffected beaches.","Curfew is lifted in Phuket, Koh Samui and Pattaya .

"A captain was forced to abort landing an easyJet plane in Turkey after three drunken passengers 'ran amok' in the aisles. The flight, from Gatwick, was delayed after the holidaymakers behaved like they were on the TV show 'Jeremy Kyle at 37,000ft', according to a passenger. The 'crazy' flight, which takes four hours, 23 minutes, only landed in Dalaman when all 155 travellers were seated. Aborted: An easyJet plane - pictured landing at Gatwick - was forced to delay arrival at Turkey due to passengers 'running amok' Police were called to meet the plane at the airport, but no arrests were made. BBC journalist Neil Henderson was on board the flight yesterday. He tweeted: 'Recovering from crazy @easyJet flight to Turkey in which drunk passengers ran amok and caused the landing to be aborted.' He said that the passengers in question were 'at the back of the plane. Next to me,' adding 'never been in an aborted landing before. Maximum G!' Mr Henderson later tweeted, comparing the experience to the ITV daytime TV show: ‘Think I need therapy, never mind a holiday. It was like Jeremy Kyle at 37,000 feet’. Social media: The passenger's tweets after the easyJet landing was aborted . 'Crazy' experience' Neil Henderson's tweets after being on board the easyJet flight to Turkey . A spokesman for easyJet told the Mirror: 'EasyJet can confirm that flight EZY8843 from London Gatwick to Dalaman, Turkey, was met by police on landing following three passengers behaving disruptively during the flight. 'Whilst such incidents are rare, we take them very seriously. The captain took the decision to delay landing to ensure the passengers were seated correctly. 'The flight then landed safely and routinely. 'The safety and welfare of our passengers and crew is always easyJet’s highest priority. We would like to apologise to passengers for any inconvenience caused.' The incident comes after the International Air Transport Association revealed the number of incidents of unruly behaviour reported to it by airlines reached 8,000 in 2013. It is urging airport ground staff and employees working in airport bars and restaurants to crack down on passengers drinking too much alcohol before a flight.","Passenger on board flight from Gatwick tweeted about 'crazy' incident .

"It's a video guaranteed to send shivers down your spine: A man attempts to tightrope walk, or 'highline' between two ice shelves, without a safety harness or net, the first time that this will ever have been achieved. The video footage shows Frenchman Tancrède Melet attempting the . first ever crevasse highline in . Chamonix's famous Vallée Blanche. It's just one of new online short film series directed by Sébastien Montaz-Rosse which shows three extreme athletes, for whom risk and adventure is a way of life, in a range of death defying situations. Highlining over an icy crevasse without a safety harness or net, skiing down an almost vertical mountainside and conquering the highest alpine peaks, all three men push themselves to the limit in the name of adventure. Scroll down for video . Barefoot, without a harness or a net, extreme athlete Tancrède Melet, shows what it takes to live life to the extreme as he attempts to highline between two ice sheets . It's a genuine heart in mouth moment as the highliner loses his balance and his footing, and falls from the wire stretching across the glacier but grabs it with his hand . Tancrède dangles by his FEET for sometime while he regains his composure, far above the icy crevasse . The extreme acts are captured in three separate videos on Sébastien Montaz-Rosset’s YouTube channels for Nivea Men, who commissioned the adventurers to cling to the side of mountains to promote their sensitive skin care range. Melet is . one athlete who is clearly not afraid of the unknown. Installing a line between two ice walls, he tries to cross the line unattached - balancing precariously above the gaping opening into the bottomless depths of the Géant glacier. Tancrède confronts fear and comes out the other side triumphant. High in the air with only a rope between himself and oblivion, composure is vital or an icy death awaits. It's literally a heart in the mouth moment as Tancrede starts to wobble halfway across, lose his balance and slip. Undeterred, Melet climbs back onto the highwire and continues his crossing without any safety harness . Nearly there: Highliner Melet continues across the sheer drop with only an icy crevass beneath him, to finish triumphant . But he manages to catch hold of the wire, where he dangles high above the crevasse, then turning himself upsidedown and hanging by his feet until he regains his composure. Tancrede gets back onto the rope and finishes his death defying crossing, giving high fives to the cameraman on the other side of the crevasse as he steps to safety. Joining highliner Tancrède Melet in the series of three videos are steep skier Vivian Bruchez and mountaineer Antoine Moineville in the French Alps. Growing up in the mountains of Chamonix, skier Bruchez spends his spare time scoping out new descents and exploring new lines. Sheer courage: Steep-skier Vivian Bruchez prepares to begin the ascent of an almost vertical mountain covered with precipitous rocks as well as snow . The final ascent: Mountaineer Antoine Moineville reaches the tope of a towering granite peak on Mont Blanc . His technique of 'dry skiing' alllows him to reach places with his skis on, where most wouldn't even venture. Setting off from the Aiguille du Midi, he enters into a labyrinth of couloirs and rocky dead ends hoping to find a way through to the untouched powder fields beyond. Meanwhile Antoine's passion is climbing mountains. Already halfway through the training to become a high mountain guide, he takes his twin brother into the towering granite peaks of the Mont Blanc massif to share his love for climbing. With a quick lesson on belay technique, Antoine sets off on a highly technical rock climbing pitch - hoping his brother will remember what to do if he falls. The three videos commissioned by Nivea Men are linked by the comapny's strapline, 'when you’re clinging to the side of a mountain the last thing you want to think about is an awkward itch!'","Highliner attempts to traverse a glacier without a safety net or rope .

"British tourists are second only to Russians when it comes to nationalities Germans dislike most when on holiday. A survey of 8,100 German holidaymakers carried out by German travel operator Urlaubstours found that Germans viewed the Russians and the British as both loud and all too often drunk. In addition, the Germans complained in the survey that Brits in particular were rude and had poor table manners. Too drunk?: A survey of German tourists found they considered Brits on holiday too loud and often drunk . Around 65 per cent of those polled said they'd had bad experiences with Russian tourists, followed in second by the Brits with 43 per cent. Polish people ranked a distant third with 29 per cent for the same reasons as the Russians and Brits, for being too loud and too drunk. In fourth is the Germans themselves, with 18 per cent citing bad experiences mainly because of a tendency to block the best sun-beds at resorts. The Dutch were close behind with 15 per cent followed by US travellers with 14.6 of Germans claiming negative experiences. They also  also disliked the Chinese for lacking table manners and the French for being rude and unfriendly, the survey said. Culture clash: Germans surveyed said they had negative experiences with Russians and Brits more than any other nations - they quite like the Swiss and Austrians though . But before you get the impression the . Germans simply can't stand anyone sharing their space during time away, . they quite like the Swiss - 96 per cent of those surveyed said they . hadn't had a bad experience involving their neighbours to the south. Another of their boarder-sharing nations, Austria, was next with 93 per cent followed by the Japanese with 92 percent. In the same survey, German holidaymaker's fourth biggest peeve when on vacation is 'people who steal the sunbeds by reserving them with a beach towel before anybody else gets a chance'. This backs up a recent online poll by travel site ab-in-den-urlaub.de that showed Germans had as little patience with sunlounger-hogs as Brits. Calling dibs: A survey found that even Germans get annoyed when their compatriots reserve sunloungers . That survey's analysis added Germans . were also irritated by their partners, hotel food, Russians again, . getting up too early and noisy children when they were abroad, with more . than three-quarters of those polled saying they spend their holidays . feeling 'on edge'. Germans take around 70million holidays a year as a nation, but are far from relaxed despite all their time off. The survey found that most Germans abroad get upset easily - including 14 per cent who are annoyed by other tourists, mainly Russians, Chinese, Brits and other Germans. But most of all, they fall out with each other - 58 per cent said they end up arguing with the person they travel with, whether it is family or friends. Hotel food leaves 35 per cent of them seething, while 21 per cent cannot stand noisy children in their resort. Chill out: A whopping 77 per cent of Germans feel stressed on holiday due to a range of factors . A further nine per cent resent waking up to blocked sunloungers - despite the humorous stereotype that it is Germans who place towels on sunloungers to reserve their spot. Psychologist Bernd Kielmann, analysing the results, said: 'During their everyday working life, partners hardly see or talk to each other. 'During their holidays, they hang around together for days and don't have much to talk about. 'It is mostly not until their holidays that the partners' free time interests also turn out to be very different. So just one partner getting up earlier can provoke an argument.","Survey found 65 per cent of 8,100 Germans polled had a bad experience with Russian tourists .

The OAD survey relies on tapping into the experience and opinions from diners who are passionate about where they eat.

"Perhaps the fish you are eating was related to those swimming above your head at Ithaa restaurant, Maldives. And it's a good idea not to go over the top on the wine if you're at the The Grotto Palazzese restaurant restaurant-on-the-rocks outside Bari, Italy. This selection of eateries is a real collection of the weird and wonderful - yet each to itself has the undeniable wow factor. Can I have a fishy, on a little dishy? Ithaa, which means mother-of-pearl in Dhivehi, is the very first undersea restaurant in the world . Floating oasis: The Rock, Zanzibar in Tanzania gives the look of the ideal postcard, and is certainly right out of the ordinary . Ithaa, which means . mother-of-pearl in Dhivehi, the under-sea restaurant off the Maldives is arguably the most impressive - as swarms of fish skim the roof over your head, concentration on what delicacy to select may well wander. The world's first undersea restaurant is five metres below sea level at the Conrad Maldives . Rangali Island in Alif Dhaal Atoll in the Maldives. The . acrylic structure has a capacity of 14 people and a transparent roof . with a 270° panoramic underwater view so you can stare at marine life . all you want. Italy's Grotto Palazzese, located on a promontory 24 metres above sea level, offers diners the chance to hear the waves crashing against the rock that actually houses the restaurant. And the grand waterfall adjacent to the appropriately-named Labassin Waterfalls Restaurant in San Pablo City, the Philippines can help soothe the diner into a warm experience. These restaurants will offer fine food, as well as an atmosphere and memories you will never forget - just don't forget your camera. Impressive: The Sirocco, Bangkok will offer unrivalled views of the city . Cave culture: The Grotto Palazzese restaurant is embedded into the cliffs of Polignano, 30 kilometres from Bari in Italy . Misty in roots: Bali's central highlands are blessed with long-reaching views of paddies, trees and valleys, and La View in Ubud offers a split level dining experience with the majestic sights of the surrounding countryside . High dining: Stylish decor and city views combine with the Asiate in New York, the showpiece restaurant of the Mandarin Oriental, New York, a hotel thirty-five stories up in the Time Warner Centre. A window seat is obviously best, but diners report that on a sunny day, when the dining room is saturated with light, any table is a joy . That falling feeling: At the Labassin Waterfalls Restaurant in San Pablo City, the Philippines, lunch is served inches from the cascading water of an impressive set of falls . Eating barefoot: The Grotto restaurant, in Hotel Rayavadee in Krabi, Thailand, inside an ancient limestone cliff on the edge of Phranang Beach. The cave, with a floor of fine-powdered sand, opens on the beach. Shoes are optional, presumably . Underground haven: Ali Barbour's Cave, converted 30 years ago, is 30km south of Mombasa in Kenya, and compromises a series of interlinking chambers at depths of up to 10m below ground level. The natural holes in the roof crust are open to the sky, and candles complete the romantic vibe of this rather magical grotto . Seaside supper: A simple wooden deck looks out onto one of the most stunning ocean views in South Africa. The Two Oceans Restaurant occupies an enviable position above False Bay at the southwestern tip of Africa . Snow pretty: A beautiful mountain chalet in Chamonix, France, Le Panoramic has to be one of the best places to bask in the view of Mont-Blanc. Situated on the summit of Brévent and easily accessible even for pedestrians using a gondola and cable car, the restaurant is taking advance bookings right around now . Vertigo nights: In Hubei Province, 12 km north of the city of Yichang, China, you can experience fine-dining on the side of a cliff... which is fine if you're not afraid of heights. If you are, the 30-metre-long narrow concrete bridge hanging on the side of a vertical cliff overlooking the Yangtze River might just be your worse nightmare. Luckily, there's a metal railing you can grab on to while you crawl your way to the restaurant carved into the cliff-side . Red red skies: The Ngorongoro Crater Lodge is located in Tanzania on the edge of the world famous World Heritage Site of the Ngorongoro Crater. Surrounding the lodge, the Conservation Area stretches from the Rift Valley to the Serengeti . Inside out: Soho House in Hollywood will give you a very 'al fresco' feeling . Panoramic views: The Kuklos-Leipzig restaurant in Switzerland, completes one turn every hour and a half; so guests can admire both the Eiger north face and Mont Blanc from their seat .","The world's most spectacular - and bizarre - restaurants include dining on the side of a cliff over the Yangtze River or underwater in the Maldives .

"Ignore your friggatriskaidekaphobia! (that's fear of Friday 13th)  - you'll be saving yourself at least £50 if you fly tomorrow. Superstitious Brits, wary of Friday 13th, are so keen to avoid flying on that day that airlines across the board have dropped their prices. Data from travel search engine KAYAK reveals that Friday 13th is the cheapest day to fly in June, with domestic UK flights coming in at £52 less than the monthly average this Friday. Get lucky: Keep those fears at bay on Friday 13th and you'll get cheaper flights . Traditionally feared as a day of accidents and mishaps, there is only one Friday 13th this year and the superstition has driven down flight prices across the board, allowing non-superstitious travellers to reap the benefits. Domestic UK return flights in June have an average price of £233, but on Friday 13th a lack of demand has slashed the average price down to £181, making it the cheapest day to travel in the entire month. Prices and demand for domestic return flights have been drawn from Kayak searches to determine if friggatriskaidekaphobia - or fear of Friday the 13th - is affecting consumer travel behaviour. Fingers crossed! Friday 13th is lucky for some . It is not only UK travellers who are afflicted by this fear: domestic flights in France, Austria and Sweden are also at their lowest price of the month this Friday. The firm's travel data shows that the superstition has reduced prices £53 below the monthly average in France. Prices are down by £24 in Austria, and the worrisome Swedes have caused a huge drop of £89. 'It is fascinating to see just how much the concern caused by Friday 13th is affecting consumer travel behaviour,' says KAYAK Managing Director Annie Wilson. 'For flight prices to be noticeably lower than the monthly average implies that people really are taking the connotations of the date into consideration when booking. 'The savvier option is to put aside superstition and snap up a bargain flight while others are battening down the hatches and waiting for the day to pass.' The ravel search engine analyses global travel search trends and processes over one billion queries for travel information annually.","Airlines across Europe have slashed their prices for Friday 13th .

"A married couple have transformed a decrepit toilet block into a trendy ice cream parlour. Mandeep and Jagbir Sidhu, both 36, spotted that the old toilets were for sale - and paid £180,000 for the whole block. The dedicated couple then spent all their time and effort ripping out urinals, sledge hammering toilets and piling heaps of bricks into skips. Makeover: Mandeep and her husband Jagbir   forked out £180,000 pounds for the block, and spent almost a year doing it up . Now nearly a year later they are now filling sundae glasses rather than skips after the parlour in Brockenhurst, Hampshire, opened last weekend. The former public conveniences - in the centre of the village - had been derelict for more than seven years. But after the transformation, customers can now purchase homemade Italian gelato and freshly ground coffee from the new parlour called Melt. The couple noticed the old toilets were for sale and felt they would be perfect to house their dream business . The owners hope to attract students from the nearby Brockenhurst College as well as villagers and tourists who want an alternative to a pub. Among the menu items designed to tempt visitors are homemade cakes, waffles and sundaes. The couple say the parlour has been themed around a rustic-style ice cream parlour but with a modern twist and aims to appeal to people of all ages. Interior overhaul: The couple have totally transformed the once derelict toilet block . Pre-refurbishment: The couple devoted all their time to ripping out urinals and sledge hammering toilets .

"Hundreds of flights across Europe have been cancelled today as the French air traffic strike goes into its second day. Thousands of travellers have been stranded due to the six-day industrial action, forced to sleep at airports or cancel their trips altogether, with some holidaymakers allegedly told they will not be able to return to Britain until next week. While flights to and from France are the most affected, routes between the UK and Spain have also been hit, as planes have to cross French airspace to complete the route. Walkout: The six-day strike is grounding 250 Ryanair flights today and a further 150 easyJet flights . Top dance acts Chase and Status and Magnetic Man's Artwork were among the celebrities affected by the strike. Both were due to perform at Ibiza's Amnesia nightclub but were unable to travel. Angry Artwork told fans on Twitter: 'So, missed going to Amnesia Ibiza tonight due to the folks at French air traffic control .... F*** you!' Missed set: Chase and Status were unable to make their slot at Amnesia in Ibiza . Student Ellis Palmer spent 15 hours attempting to get to Barcelona yesterday to start a language course at the University of Barcelona after being faced with two cancelled Ryanair flights at two different airports. After the initial flight at Liverpool was cancelled, the 19-year-old was sent to Manchester for an alternative departure. But that flight never took off after a frustrating 90 minute wait on the runway. Ellis, from Liverpool, is now hoping it’s third time lucky this evening as he attempts to fly out again.He told MailOnline Travel today: ‘Ryanair have rebooked my flight for a third time now. Frustrating wait: Ellis Palmer, from Liverpool, has been trying to get to Spain to start a language course at the University of Barcelona . 'The delay of my departure from the UK forced to me have to cancel my first day on a language course at the University of Barcelona which I'm undertaking as part of my university studies. 'It's been more than 24 hours since I started the journey. Yesterday I spent 15 hours attempting to travel to Barcelona and I'm still no closer to my destination after two cancelled flights at two different airports. ‘After the original flight at Liverpool was cancelled the staff were helpful and booked us on to the flight at Manchester but that was cancelled after 1h 30m on the tarmac. ‘Only one member of staff at Manchester Airport seemed to know the rights of passengers who were left stranded but thankfully I knew mine and they booked a cab home for me. ‘I eventually got back home at 1am.’ Kind-hearted Ellis then helped foreign students find accommodation for the night after they were left to sleep on the floor of the airport. He said: 'I I helped translate their rights as I'm a Spanish language student and told them what they were entitled to.' Knock-on effect: Passengers were delayed at Stansted Airport as the French air traffic strike got underway . After . cancelling around 200 flights on Tuesday, Ryanair warned travellers that . the situation is likely to worsen today, with 250 flights cancelled. The . budget airline slammed the industrial action by French workers and . called on the European Commission to remove air traffic controllers' right to strike - as exists among police officers in the UK. Accusing the strikers of 'blakmailing' ordinary consumers, Ryanair warned of 'severe disruption' as a result of the action. A . statement from the airline read: 'We expect that these delays will . continue to build through the morning as the backlog of delayed flights . rises. In order to minimise disruptions on the rest of our network . Ryanair has been forced regrettably to cancel approximately 15 per cent . of Ryanair’s total schedule of over 1,600 flights today. 'We . expect these disruptions to flights to/from France, Belgium and Spain . will worsen this morning as all airlines schedules are heavily disrupted . by this unnecessary and regrettable French ATC strike. 'All customers affected by these cancellations will be offered a choice of reaccommodation on later flights or full refunds.' EasyJet . also confirmed that it has cancelled 150 flights today due to the . strike as its planes are dependent on flying through French airspace. Long wait: Extra security was drafted in at Stansted to help control the crowds gathering . Uncertainty: Chaos ruled at the airport as airlines waited on the latest news from France about whether flights could cross French airspace . A . statement read: 'EasyJet can confirm that it will cancel 150 flights, . of the 1,400 scheduled to operate today, due to the French air traffic . control strike. 'As . 65 per cent of easyJet’s network travels through French air space we . advise all passengers travelling today to be prepared for delays and to . check the status of their flight on www.easyJet.com or via the easyJet . flight tracker. British . Airways wiped out around 24 and has already axed another 28 flights . tomorrow. Passengers with Monarch and Flybe are also badly affected. Airlines . unable to access congested airspace over France have done their best to . fly around it, but flights are subject to long delays.

Luton Airport reported delays to 60 per . cent of departing flights while Heathrow said it had 44 cancellations. Gatwick said most services were held up because of knock-on effects. Yesterday, one holiday maker at Stansted, Jane Goulding, 47, said: 'I have never seen the airport . this busy before. I'm worried I'm going to be queuing here for hours.' Eurocontrol, . a European air safety organisation, estimated the action would cause . almost 14,000 hours, of delays in total over the six days. Disruption: Eurocontrol, a European air safety organisation, estimated the action would cause almost 14,000 hours of delays . Delays: A spokesman for Stansted Airport said they were working with the airlines to make sure passengers had the latest information about their flights . Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: 'Check with your airline before travelling to find out if you'll be affected by the French air strike action. 'If you are affected, visit the Which? Consumer Rights website and find out your rights because if your flight is delayed due to a strike, the airline may have an obligation to offer you assistance.' Air traffic controllers are just one of a host of sectors staging industrial action and crippling the tourism industry in France. Rail strike is ongoing: Angry protester holds a banner opposing a rail road reform . Travellers hoping to take alternative rail routes will face further delays thanks to a ten-day rail protest. French retail workers are also set to strike in protest at the government’s decision to introduce Sunday opening hours to boost tourism. This will mean that famous Paris department stores including Galeries Lafayette and Printemps will be closed for those who do make it across the Channel.","Flights between the UK France and Spain affected .

"It's the kind of behaviour expected of a rock star, not a honeymooning bridegroom. But one young couple's holiday ended in disaster when the groom was forced to fly back alone after being ordered to pay £4,000 to replace a broken television. Former soldier Wesley Dyson and his bride Heather were on the last day of their holiday in the resort of Holguin at the Paradisus del Rio D'Oro when they were ordered off their airport transfer coach. Hellish: Wesley and Heather Dyson were on the last day of their holiday when they were told a damaged TV had been found in their hotel room . The couple, from Farnworth Lancashire, were told a damaged TV had been found in their hotel room. Mr Dyson, 36, was told he would have to pay 10 times the cost value of the TV - 6,600 Cuban pesos or about £4,000 - or the police would not give him his passport back. He had to wave his 31-year-old wife off in a taxi before spending an extra night in a separate Cuban hotel, making arrangements for the cash to be put in place. Neither of the couple remember damaging the 32-inch television that had been in their room and hotel staff would not allow them back into the room to inspect it. Idyllic: The pool at the resort of Holguin at the Paradisus del Rio D'Oro, where the couple stayed . Mr Dyson, who now works as a HGV driver, said they are desperately hoping their travel insurance will cover the replacement payment. He flew back alone to Gatwick, rather than Manchester, a day later than scheduled on June 3. Mr Dyson said: 'The hotel was run by the military and we were advised paying would be in our best interests'. The newlyweds enjoy the facilities at their hotel in Cuba, before being accused of breaking the television . 'They said, if you don't pay that within three days then an investigation will start and you will be held. 'I was in the army for 13 years and have been all over the world but I've never been treated like that anywhere. 'It was horrendous - like a Cuban hell.' He warned other holidaymakers to be on guard when visiting countries like Cuba and to carry out a personal inventory of the contents of their hotel rooms complete with pictures. Hotel nightmare: Wesley Dyson, 36, pictured in the second room the couple stayed in after initially being allocated a twin room, despite paying for a honeymoon suite at the Holguin resort . Mr Dyson added: 'I don't want anyone else to be waving their new wife off in a taxi in a foreign country on her own. It was terrible. 'We had been saving for the wedding and a dream honeymoon for months so we just don't have £4,000 to hand. 'I had to borrow it off my dad in the end.' Calm before the storm: HGV driver Wesley Dyson and his wife Heather enjoying two-week holiday in Cuba before being ordered to pay £4000 . The couple booked their holiday through Thomas Cook and Mr Dyson said the reps in Cuba had been helpful but also advised him that paying for the TV would 'in his best interests'. Mr Dyson is now waiting to see if his travel insurance policy with ERV will pay out for the bill. By paying, despite the circumstances, Mr Dyson is concerned it will appear as though he is accepting liability. Happier times: Mr Dyson was told he would have to pay 10 times the cost value of the TV or the police would not give him his passport back . A Thomas Cook UK and Ireland spokesman said: 'As soon as our highly experienced resort team was made aware of the situation Mr Dyson was in, representatives went to the hotel and offered him every support possible right through until the time he was able to return home. 'Our customer services team is also in contact with Mr Dyson to see if any further assistance can be provided.' The management of the Paradisus del Rio D'Oro failed to respond to requests for a comment.","Wesley and Heather Dyson, from Lancashire, were ordered off their airport transfer coach on the last day of their honeymoon in Cuba .

"It's the gadget that gives passengers who hate their legroom being invaded by reclining plane seats a chance to fight back. The Knee Defender - billed with the tagline 'Standing up for the right of the tall guy to sit down' - is two pieces of plastic that are clipped on to the seat in front on a flight. Fastening on to the arms of the tray table, the device, which costs £13, it locks the chair in front into place, preventing the passenger from reclining. Guaranteed legroom: The £13 gadget clips on to the tray table arms, preventing the seat in front from reclining . Knee Defender: The gadget was created by a 6ft 2ins American Ira Goldman . The Knee Defender is sold on Gadget Duck along with a note that the buyer can print out, fill in and hand to the passenger in front. The 'Courtesy Card' tells the person in front that the gadget is being used, giving an choice of reasons including: 'Unfortunately, my legs are so long that if you recline your seat at all it would immediately bang into my knees.' It continues to state that it 'may be an inconvenience' and encourages the passenger to complain to the airline 'to provide enough space between rows so that people can recline their seats without banging into other passengers'. Pocket-size: The Knee Defender is no bigger than a front door key . Lack of space: The device prevents the seat in front from reclining, guaranteeing your legroom . According to news.com.au, one user on Reddit who posted that he had been given the note on board a flight, wrote: 'Guy sitting behind me on  the plane handed me this as I was finding my seat before take off (my seat was up). 'I had no idea what to say.' The gadget was invented by 6ft 2ins Ira Goldman, from the US. According to the company’s site: 'Knee Defenders are specifically designed to be used with your tray table lowered, while your tray table must be up and locked during taxiing, takeoffs or landings. Courtesy Card: The note is handed to the passenger in front, alerting them to why the gadget is being used . Locked in place: The Knee Defender also comes with a Courtesy Card to alert the passenger in front . 'So, as long as Knee Defenders are being used as they are designed to be used in flight, their use does not violate any US aviation law, rule, or regulation.' It adds: 'If the airlines will not protect people from being battered, crunched, and immobilized – very real problems according to healthcare professionals, medical studies, government agencies, and even some airlines – then people need options to protect themselves.' Although the product does not violate any aviation laws, individual airlines can choose to ban its use on board their flights.","Device is made up of two pieces of plastic that clip on to tray table arms .

"It is said to give energy and boost a flagging sex drive but this local Peruvian blend is not for the faint-hearted. Tourists in the country have been sampling a popular drink that is available to buy from vendors on street corners across the capital: fresh frog juice. A video that appeared on YouTube shows a man drinking a green smoothie that contains a whole frog after it has been put through a blender with various herbs and spices. Scroll down for video . What's cooking?: A frog is heated up as a Peruvian vendor prepares a frog drink for a customer . Preparation: The vendor cleans the four-legged morsel before it's cooked and blended up . Frog in a blender: Not like it, it is an actual frog being blitzed up for human consumption . Take the strain: The liquid, once blended, needs to be strained before it's served up . Mmmm: A traveller doesn't need to be asked twice to down the green beverage . Tasty: A tourist shows his empty cup after downing a frog milkshake . The video below, which contains images that some people may find disturbing, shows a tourist selecting a frog to add to his drink from a tank below a shop counter. The vendor plucks the unlucky amphibian from the tank, kills it with a knife and then skins it before cooking it in a pan on a small counter-top stove. The . mixture is then poured into a blender and whizzed into a juice, while . the man filming it can be heard to say: ‘Bones and all, people, bones . and all!’ Energy drink: Frog juice is popular in Lima where locals believe it can boost stamina and sex drive .

Desperate efforts to find the Grecian-style cool-grey dress failed despite a massive social media campaign backed by hundreds if Sydneysiders trying to help. In the end, Ms Box had to wear a dark dress different to the two other bridesmaids, and she's relieved the bride has been very understanding about it all.

"The principal of a Queensland primary school who banned handstands and cartwheels in the playground has been subjected to 'cowardly cyberattacks' by parents, the state education minister said. Peregrian Springs State School parents were advised in a school newsletter in August that handstands, cartwheels and other 'cheerleading-style' stunts were not allowed unless children were under supervision of a trained physical education teacher. Some parents and others in the school community were outraged by the ban, which critics said placed unnecessary restrictions on their children's play time. Peregian Springs State School's decision top stop students from doing cartwheels and handstands without supervision has prompted 'cowardly cyberattacks' on principal Gwen Sands . Queensland Education Minister John-Paul Langrbroek told Parliament on Tuesday he stood by principal Gwen Sands' decision to impose the ban, which was made after two students were injured at school while doing 'gymnastic cheerleading' in the concrete playground. 'Gwen Sands was held up to ridicule by the media, pilloried internationally as a perpetrator of crimes against children and derided as the worst of the nanny state officials,' Mr Langrbroek told Parliament on Tuesday. 'But the most hurtful were the cowardly cyberattacks launched via Facebook and Twitter, many from parents of the students in her care,' he said. 'There were single lines and stinging rebukes sent without thought for the consequence or the power that words can have, even against adults.' These parents were the same people who expect schools to protect their children from bullies and who 'march straight into the principal's office demanding these measures for their children,' Mr Langrbroek said. The handstand ban follow injuries to two students while doing 'gymnastic cheerleading' in the school's mostly concrete playground, Queensland Education Minister John Langrbroek said . 'Do we now need to start a campaign to protect our teachers and principals from the very people who should know better, the parents of the children entrusted to their care?' Mr Langrbroek said. 'I spoke to principal Sands and I told her I had her back 100 per cent because I support our principals to make the right decisions for their communities.' The Queensland Department of Education has said it was up to the school to make individual decisions about activities in the playground. Not all parents were unhappy with the decision. Others took to Facebook to say they supported Dr. Sands and the school's commitment to the students' safety.","Principal Gwen Sands was derided as 'the worst of the nanny state officials'

"The biological Thai mother of baby Gammy and his twin sister Pipah has revealed she hopes to travel to Australia to see the baby girl who has remained under the care of David and Wendy Farnell. Pattharamon Janbua told the Sun Herald that she cannot stop thinking about Pipah, originally named Paiparee, since giving birth to the children after agreeing to act as the Australian couple's surrogate mother. 'Every day I look at Gammy and see Pipah in his eyes,' she told the Sun Herald. Scroll down for video . Pattaramon Janbua, pictured here with surrogate child Gammy, says she wants to travel to Australia to visit his twin Pipah . 'I just want to hug Pipah again… I miss her a lot every day.' Ms Janbua was left with now nine-month-old Gammy, who was diagnosed with Down syndrome and suffers from a heart condition, when the Farnells left him behind and took only his healthy sister home with them to West Australia. The story led to mass public outcry and a reshaping of surrogacy laws, particularly following revelations that Mr Farnell was formerly convicted for paedophilia. The 21-year-old says she has no intention of taking Pipah for herself, but simply misses her biological child . Despite this, Ms Janbua told the Sun Herald that she has no intention of claiming Pipah for herself. 'I'll be very happy for Pipah if they love and take care of her. I will not destroy the family's happiness,' she said. Ms Janbua did however mention that she would take the little girl under her care if Mr and Mrs Farnell were deemed unsuitable guardians by Australian authorities. Ms Janbua did say she would take Pipah (pictured) under her care if Mr and Mrs Farnell were deemed unsuitable guardians by Australian authorities . Until then, the 21-year-old said she would continue to work and save money for her trip to Australia, which she revealed she would not risk bringing Gammy to in case she was unable to bring him home again. Her fear comes a month after the Farnells claimed they missed their son in an interview with 60 Minutes, saying 'we want to get our son back'. According to Thai surrogacy laws however, baby Gammy's surrogate mother can not be forced to give up custody as Thai civil law states that the birth mother is his legal mother and that both children were both born Thai citizens.","Pattharamon Janbua revealed she hopes to travel to Australia to see Gammy's twin sister Pipah .

"Lance Franklin was racially slurred during a match against the Western Bulldogs on Sunday . Footy star Lance 'Buddy' Franklin has lauded AFL supporters for alerting police to a racial slur by a rival fan during a game on Sunday. The AFL player was allegedly called an 'ape' by a 70-year-old supporter who was evicted by police from Melbourne's Etihad Stadium after fans said they heard him abuse the Sydney Swans forward during a match against the Western Bulldogs. The fan also allegedly abused another player during the game. Franklin said the support from spectators was 'a positive step forward for AFL'. 'It's disappointing that it's still happening in the community and especially at football games,' Franklin said on Monday. 'It's obviously very good that the crowd's come forward and spoken up. 'I think it's definitely something that needs to be cut out of the game and the more we can teach people not to be racist the better for the game.' The abuse is almost identical to the racial slur against fellow Swans forward Adam Goodes, who was called an 'ape' by a 13-year-old Collingwood fan during a match last season . Supporters in the ground complained about the man's 'offensive behaviour' to police, and he was escorted and given a penalty notice in relation to the incident. Witnesses say they heard the word 'ape' directed at the Franklin. However the Sydney Swans club confirmed that none of its players heard the slur. Franklin was one of the game's best, kicking six goals in the 63-point thumping of the Western Bulldogs in front of a crowd of 22,000. The 70-year-old man, from Newport in Melbourne's southwest, was evicted from the ground about 4.35pm, about halfway through he match when Sydney were already well in front. Scroll down for video . The Sydney Swans said that none of its players hear the allegations of racial abuse . Write caption here . An AFL Australia spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia the man 'was not a club member' of the Western Bulldogs and that the incident was a matter for the police. It is the second time in a year that a Sydney Swans player has been racially abused, after legendary AFL footballer Adam Goodes was also called an Ape by a 13-year-old fan. The incident was further inflamed when Collingwood president Eddie McGuire said that Goodes should be used to promote the musical King King in Melbourne. Goodes,  the 2013 Australian Of The Year, went public over both incidents and earlier this year said McGuire's comments had ended their friendship. Two incidents of racial abuse were also reported at AFL matches last year, including one involving North Melbourne's Sudanese-born Majak Daw. Television reports said Daw, who escaped to Australia with his family from civil wars in Sudan, was racially abused by a Hawthorn supporter during a match at the MCG. Adam Goodes singled out a supporter during the match against Collingwood last year .

"Adelaide Crows defender Daniel Talia has kept his driving licence, telling a court he was speeding 36km over the limit because he was distracted by his sick cat. The 22-year-old AFL star, who drove 96km/h in a 60km/h road works zone on the South Eastern expressway in February, said he didn't see the reduced speed sign because he was so distracted by his cat vomiting violently in the back seat of his car. In the Adelaide magistrates court on Wednesday, Magistrate Bob Harrap fined Talia $824 for exceeding the speed limit by more than 30km/h. He lost four demerit points, instead of seven, because of his significant training commitments.

"Police have interviewed five men in relation to an alleged gang rape which happened in a Melbourne lane on Sunday morning. The men were interviewed by police following an appeal for information in the early morning attack, which saw a 47-year-old woman's feet bound with masking tape and raped by five men in Snowball Lane, South Yarra, in Melbourne's inner city. The men, three 20-year-olds from Bentleigh, a 21-year-old from Dandenong and a 19-year-old from Bentleigh, attended the police station at 9pm last night. Police confirmed they were released pending further investigations. CCTV footage released by police of a man they wish to identify in relation to the brutal gang rape of a woman in inner Melbourne . Another suspect police are looking to to identify over the attack that took place in South Yarra, Melbourne . The interviews follow the release of security footage by police yesterday. A woman, 47, was allegedly bound and raped by a group of five men in Snowball Lane, South Yarra, in Melbourne's trendy inner south at 4.15am on Sunday morning. After the incident, the victim ran naked to nearby Chapel Street where she raised the alarm. Chapel Street is a well-known entertainment strip in Melbourne and is considered one of the city's most exclusive suburbs. Police described the attack as 'traumatic' for the woman, who was taken to hospital for treatments afterwards. Detectives from the Sexual Crimes Squad are investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident and will review all CCTV footage in the area in an attempt to identify those involved. Detective Acting Senior Sergeant Michael Phyland said all five men sexually assaulted the woman, whose ankles were bound with masking tape during the attack. 'It's been a very traumatic occurrence for the victim,' he said. Det Sen Sgt Phyland said some of the details of the attack were still unclear and it was too early to tell if it was planned. 'At this stage it may appear more of an opportunistic situation,' Det Sen Sgt Phyland said on Tuesday. 'She was on her own and she had been in that area,' he said. The two men (above) police want to speak to over the attack . Investigators are appealing for anyone with information to come forward and assist them with their investigation. They have released CCTV footage of two men they want to speak to entering a store shortly after the attack. Asked if the woman was a sex worker, Det Sen Sgt Phyland said he would not discuss the victim's personal circumstances. One of the men the woman was seen with was a 25-to 30-year-old Caucasian, about 175cm tall, with short blond hair, a black hoodie and dark pants. The other was a 20 to 30-year-old man of Islander appearance, about 183cm tall, with a solid build, wearing a black shirt with white writing and a checked shirt on top of that.

"A baby wombat has made a full recovery after being found in the pouch of her dead mother's body. After noticing the animal at the side of the road, passerby decided to check if the creature was carrying any offspring. Incredibly, despite its mother being struck by a car, the teeny critter was found shivering inside its pouch, still suckling at its mother teat. Recovery: Leah the wombat survived the death of her mother and is now making good progress at the home of Kim Hunter in Kinglake, Victoria . After an urgent phone call from a passerby to the local wildlife helpline, voluntary animal carer and ranger, Kim Hunter, 48, came to the rescue of the baby wombat and took it her home in Kinglake, Victoria. Despite being merely hours away from death, Kim has managed to nurse the wombat named Leah, back to health with round-the-clock care. By bottle feeding the adorable wombat every four hours, the five-week-old is now on the road to recovery. Tiny: Leah was hours from death when she was found but, with round-the-clock care survived . Fully grown: Leah will eventually develop a thick coat of fur . Kim said 'Leah was cold to the touch and weighed only 300 grams when she arrived, she now weighs 650 grams. 'She's very lucky, although she was uninjured she was cold to the touch and I'd say she was only a few hours away from dying. 'Wombats often graze at the side of the road and are sometimes hit by oncoming cars, her mother must have shielded her against the blow. 'Leah is too young to grow her own fur yet so I keep her on a heated mat, I have to bottle feed her every four hours, even throughout the night.

"They have been touted by some as the cheap and eco-friendly future of energy. But many of Britain’s solar panels are not actually generating as much power as they could – because they are facing the wrong way, an expert has warned. Angling solar panels in an alternating east and west-facing formation, rather than in rows facing directly towards the south, would actually increase the amount of electricity generated overall. This house, built in the thirties, has a solar panel heating system across the roof (File photo) Such a formation means they do not . need to be spaced out, as there would be a reduction in shadow. This . allows them to be active for a longer period each day. It . would also cut the risk of disruption to the National Grid, says Ralph . Gottschalg, of Loughborough University, who is working on a UK-wide . project aiming to answer a number of questions relating to the . production of energy through solar panels. In . solar farms or industrial premises with swathes of solar panels, they . are broadly positioned to face south following the logic that they will . pick up the most sunlight. However, the shadows they cast means the panel behind can’t be too close together. Video courtesy of Eco Experts . A single east-west panel produces slightly less electricity than single south-facing one, twice as many panels can be packed in the same space . As . Britain’s use of solar power increases, this could lead to disruption . to the grid. Plus, excess energy that cannot be stored will be wasted . Professor . Gottschalg, an expert in solar technology, said that laying them . flatter and angling them so that they face east and west alternately . would cut the amount of shading and so allow them to be put more closely . together. And while it is . true a single east or west-facing panel produces slightly less . electricity than a single south-facing one, around twice as many panels . can be packed in the same space. Even when the cost of installing the . extra panels is taken into account, savings will be made in the long . run. Professor Gottschalg . admits that his theory is not easily adopted by householders who install . solar panels as they  cannot change the shape of their roof. Nearly . half a million British homes have solar panels and the typical family . saves an estimated £800 a year due to cheaper energy bills and green . subsidies. But Professor Gottschalg does suggest that, where possible, homeowners should take advantage of panels that face east and west. Speaking . on Radio Four, he said that south-facing panels generate the most . electricity in the afternoon when the sun is at its highest – but this . is when householders are out at work and cannot use all the power . generated. While some can be stored in batteries, much of the excess electricity is fed back into the national grid. And as Britain’s use of solar power increases, this could even lead to disruption to the grid. However, . he would like to see a ‘smart subsidy’ introduced that would . incentivise owners of large-scale solar farms to angle their panels . differently. Leonie Greene, . of the Solar Trade Association, said householders should not worry as . the difference in electricity generated by south, east and west-facing . panels is small. However, large-scale installations could benefit from installing a combination of panels.","Prof Ralph Gottschalg, of Loughborough University, said that angling solar panels east and west would increase the amount of electricity generated .

"Toddlers who watch lots of TV do worse at school – and even sets left on in the background can be harmful, a leading expert has warned. Lynne Murray, a professor of developmental psychology, said that two large-scale reviews from the US made it ‘absolutely clear’ that watching television has no benefits for under-twos. And if you look at the research in detail, children who spend a lot of time in front of the screen have poorer vocabulary and do worse academically – even when other factors such as socio-economic class and parenting are taken into account. Warning: Leading expert Lynne Murray has warned that toddlers who watch lots of TV do worse at school ¿ and even sets left on in the background can be harmful . In her new book, the Psychology of Babies, Professor Murray said that the respected American Academy of Pediatrics advises against under-twos watching TV at all. Not only are loud, fast-moving programmes difficult for the young mind to follow, they can disrupt play and prevent children interacting with siblings and parents. Even a television set left on in the background can be damaging. Speaking at her book launch, the professor said: ‘If you look at the effect of television just being on in the background and children playing on the floor their focus of attention is likely to be less good.’ ‘However, there are mitigating things.  If you sit down and watch the television alongside your child, if you talk them through what’s happening, that definitely mitigates any negative consequences.’ Positives: Professor Murray said watching the same programme over and over is helpful, as it gives developing brains time to process the information and anticipate what is going to happen next . Watching the same programme over and over is also helpful, as it gives developing brains time to process the information and anticipate what is going to happen next. However, a lot of children’s TV is badly made. Professor Murray, of Reading University, said: ‘A lot of children’s television is so poorly designed it could do better. ‘Loud and flashing and fast things and we know from studies that children’s attention is not able to grasp things happening that quickly.’ Despite her concerns, she is not in favour of an outright ban. She said: ‘If you have got a depressed mother who is at her wits’ end and she needs a break for half an hour to have a cup of tea, I definitely wouldn’t be the one to say “Don’t put the television on”.’ The professor also gives advice on how best to get babies into a sleep routine, says that reading to a child is one of best ways of boosting its brainpower and that the first two years of life provide the foundations of everything from sociability to IQ.","Professor Lynne Murray says sets left on in background can be harmful .

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott has refused to be drawn in to the baby Gammy surrogacy scandal, saying federal law should not 'intrude into the bedroom'. Mr Abbott was asked whether rules should be tightened to stop convicted criminals from obtaining a child via a surrogate. The Australian father at the centre of the scandal, David Farnell, is a convicted child sex offender. He was also pressed on on Channel 9's Today Show about whether legislation should be changed so parents desperate to have children do not find themselves at the mercy of unscrupulous agencies in countries like Thailand, where Gammy is currently in hospital. ‘The law shouldn’t intrude into the bedroom,' he said. 'This is a difficult and complex area. We have to enforce the laws of the country. Scroll down for video . Pattaramon Janbua is the birth mother of baby Gammy who  is embroiled in a Thai-Australian surrogacy scandal . 'This is a matter for the states. These are state laws and I don't want to complicate the matter further. 'I can completely understand the desire of people to become parents and the desperate measures they will go to. But if it’s illegal in Thailand, it shouldn’t be done (surrogacy). 'Don't do anything illegal or you will suffer the consequences.' His comments come as it was claimed the Thai surrogate mother at the centre of the controversy could face charges in Thailand. Thai medical authorities are threatening to take action against Pattaramon Janbua, 21, as the Ministry of Public Health and other agencies crack down on medical institutions and clinics linked to the commercial surrogacy the ministry calls 'illegal'. Ms Pattaramon was paid a total of $16,000 to be the surrogate mother of Gammy, seven months old, who was then allegedly abandoned by David and Wendy Farnell . 'I have never lied or hidden anything. The truth is the truth; it's up to society to make their own judgment,' Ms Pattaramon told Agence France Press (AFP). It has also been reported Gammy's Australian father was a convicted paedophile. 'Personally, when I heard the news I was shocked but I can't say anything much right now,' Ms Pattaramon said at a press conference in her hometown, adding she would 'leave it to the law' to see if she could get the girl back. But despite the threat of the Thai law working against Ms Pattaramon in her home country, it could be the exact opposite here in Australia. It is alleged the Western Australian couple abandoned Gammy to his fate after they found out he had Down syndrome and a congenital heart condition . Professor Jenni Millbank, a surrogacy law expert at Sydney's University of Technology, said Ms Pattaramon could seek custody of the daughter through the Australian courts. 'She's a legal parent. If she turned up in the Family Court tomorrow, she could seek the return of that child, if that's what she wanted,' Millbank told Nine News. Meanwhile, seven-month-old baby Gammy is receiving treatment at a Bangkok hospital, where he is being treated for a congenital heart condition. A spokesman for the hospital said the baby was now receiving specialist care and is 'in safe hands'. Initially David and Wendy Farnell told the Nine network they had no knowledge of the other child, but a statement released on Tuesday said they were told of the baby's existence but that it had a congenital heart condition and was not expected to live. The case has spurred widespread debate, putting Thailand under the spotlight because of its weak legal framework overseeing surrogacy and in vitro-fertilisation (IVF) laws. Thai law firm Chaniwat and Leeds, which says it will cover surrogacy and IVF cases on its website, warns of possible 'complicated legal issues'. 'While surrogacy in Thailand is currently an option and a rapidly-growing area of medical innovation, there are a number of legal considerations prospective parents should consider,' the firm told AAP. The lawyers said Thailand currently has no laws or published case decisions directly relating to the practice of surrogacy, 'and in essence surrogacy is neither legal nor illegal in Thailand'. Agencies and health clinics openly engage in locating surrogate mothers and egg donors. 'Thailand's Medical Council has taken a cautious approach to the practices of IVF implantation, egg donation, and surrogacy; these practices are still in a legal and medical ""grey area"",' the firm said. Investigations are now under way by Thailand's Bureau of Sanatorium and Art in Healing under the Department of Health Service Support (HSS) into the surrogacy service clinics. There are reported to be an estimated 20 surrogacy agencies, most said to be foreign-owned drawing in an estimated $133 million annually.","Pattaramon Janbua may face charges in Thailand, medical authorities say .

"Our violent past is all over our faces. Biologists say that as apes evolved into humans, their faces took on fighting features such as thicker jaws and foreheads. The characteristics were previously thought to be adaptations for a diet of hard-to-chew foods, such as nuts. But researchers at the University of . Utah point out that they developed around the same time as humans . acquired the ability to curl their hand into a club-like fist. Biologists say that as humans evolved, their faces took on fighting features like thicker jaws and foreheads . Professor David Carrier said the changes could have been to ‘better protect’ the face when punched. Humans evolved to be weedy so that there was more than enough energy for the brain. Scientists from the CAS-MPG Partner Institute for Computational Biology in Shanghai believe human muscle needed to alter drastically to free up energy for the brain, becoming puny as a result. Lead researcher in the study, Dr Kasia Bozek, said: ‘Our results suggest a special energy management in humans that allows us to spare energy for our extraordinary cognitive powers at a cost of weak muscle.’ Over the course of evolution, essential molecules have changed more rapidly in human muscle than in the brain. Molecules in the human brain evolved four times faster than in chimps. The results suggest special energy management in humans that allow us to spare energy for our cognitive powers at a cost of weak muscle. He said: ‘If indeed the evolution of our hand proportions were associated with selection for fighting behaviour you might expect the primary target, the face, to have undergone evolution to better protect it from injury when punched. 'When modern humans fight hand-to-hand the face is usually the primary target. 'What we found was that the bones that suffer the highest rates of fracture in fights are the same parts of the skull that exhibited the greatest increase in robusticity.’ Writing in the journal Biological Reviews, he said that many of these fighting features were softer in the modern human. However, the modern male face still exhibits some ‘fighting features’ that are less prominent in females. These include thicker, stronger bones in the forehead, cheeks, jaw and neck. And it seems that even over the course of four to five million years, some things have not changed. A spokesman for the research team described the early brawls as ‘the prehistoric version of a bar fight, over women, resources and other slug-worthy disagreements’. The features were previously thought to be adaptations for a diet of hard-to-chew foods. But they developed around the same time as humans acquired the ability to curl their hand into a club-like fist (file picture)","As apes evolved into humans, faces developed thicker jaws and foreheads .

"It is the fruit most associated with those lazy, hazy days of British summer. So perhaps it comes as no surprise the strawberry has been crowned the ‘happiest fruit’. Its appeal is so strong that 86 per cent of people feel more relaxed just by thinking about eating one, a survey for the University of London revealed. Researcher Professor Barry Smith said it is the distinctive smell of strawberries that evokes happy memories. Feeling better yet? A study found six out of seven people are happier after they imagine tasting a strawberry . Fruits such as apples bring back less pleasant memories of meals on the go, while bananas and plums were the least likely to improve mood. The study also found that sound impacts on taste, with the noise of a picnic or lawnmower making strawberries seem fruitier than a background of honking traffic or a bustling office. Finally, despite our love of strawberries and cream, those who took part in the study for the growers at British Summer Fruits said they were more likely to associate the berries with the smell of freshly cut grass. With this in mind, chef James ‘Jocky’ Petrie, of the Ledbury restaurant in London’s Notting Hill, has created a strawberry sandwich complete with a ‘grass’ layer – made from white chocolate and wheatgrass. Spreading the love: Tim Henman hands out strawberries to people waiting in the queue at Wimbledon 2012 . Professor Smith, who did the research at the University of London’s Centre for the Study of the Senses, said: ‘The smell is difficult to create artificially. 'Flavouring companies have failed at it by and large and yet it is so powerful as a reminder of those happy summer days.’","University of London survey found fruit is most associated with summer .

"The research found that children who ate breakfast with a parent at least five times a week were 40 percent less likely to be obese (picture posed by model) Families that eat together stay slim together. A study found that children who regularly sit down to breakfast or dinner with their parents are thinner than those who eat alone. The finding is important because fat children tend to become fat adults and obesity can knock up to a decade of life, as well as raise the odds of a host of illnesses. In Britain, fewer than half of families routinely eat together. Experts said that family meals tend to be healthier than those eaten alone.  Parents that eat with their children may also have more time to spend with them in general. Norwegian researchers collected information on the eating habits of almost 8,000 boys and girls from eight countries across Europe. The youngsters, who were aged between ten and 12, were also weighed and measured. The results showed that children who ate breakfast with at least one parent at least five times a week were 40 per cent less likely to be overweight than others. Family breakfasts cut the odds of being overweight by 30 per cent, the European Congress on Obesity in Sofia, Bulgaria heard. Surprisingly, family lunches had the opposite effect. However, the researchers, from the University of Agder in Norway, said this may be a rogue result caused by the many different lunching practices across Europe muddying the picture . For instance, Norwegian schools don’t have canteens, so children take their food in with them, while youngsters in Greece tend to go home for lunch. Researchers found that children who ate family meal with their parents were 30 percent less likely to be obese . Researcher Dr Frøydis Vik said: ‘The results show that having family meals, such as breakfast and dinner may be of importance to a healthy weight status of children. ‘Children and adolescents with obesity have a greater risk of also being obese as adults. ‘And since it is really difficult to lose weight and lose weight on a permanent basis, it is really difficult to prevent becoming overweight in the first place.’ Dr Gavin Sandercock of the University of Essex, said that just 48 per cent of British families regularly eat together. He said that family meals give parents a control what their child is eating and teach them about the value of good nutrition. Eating together may also be a sign that parents have time to spend with their children and that they set rules on things like bedtime that benefit health. Research has also shown that happier families eat together. Dr Sandercock said: ‘It could be as simple as if you eat together, you have healthier, home-cooked food.’","Children who eat breakfast with at least one parent are 40 percent less likely to be obese .

"Thousands of lives a year could be saved by using a dialysis-like device to clean up poisoned blood, research suggests. Each year, some 37,000 Britons die of sepsis, after their immune system dramatically overreacts to an infection, causing their organs to fail. This makes sepsis a bigger killer than breast and bowel cancer combined. Each year, some 37,000 Britons die of sepsis, after their immune system dramatically overreacts to an infection, causing their organs to fail (File photo) Those at risk include patients who have had their appendix removed, as well as people with drips, catheters and even simple urinary tract infections. Identifying the bug at the root of the problem can take days – and even then the antibiotics used don’t always work. Researcher Dr Mike Super, who was part-funded by the U.S. military, said: ‘Even with the best treatments, sepsis patients are dying in intensive care units at least 30 per cent of the time. ‘We need a new approach. Sepsis kills at least eight million people worldwide each year and it’s the leading cause of hospital deaths.’ Rather than using drugs to kill the bacteria, the solution may be to remove them from the blood. Identifying the bug at the root of the Sepsis problem can take days – and even then the antibiotics used don’t always work (File photo) Dr Super’s team from the Harvard Wyss Institute in Boston have built a dialysis-like device that removes germs and poisons from the blood. Tiny magnetic beads coated with substance that attracts numerous types of bacteria, virus and other invaders, are used to catch the germs. The infection-coated beads are then pulled out of the blood using a magnet and the clean blood put back into the patient. In tests, 90 per cent of rats treated using the ‘biospleen’ survived potentially deadly infections – compared to just 14 per cent of untreated animals, the journal Nature Medicine reports. Dr Super said: ‘We didn’t have to kill the pathogens. We just captured and removed them.’ This saves times and means that antibiotic-resistant germs, which are becoming increasing common, should be readily combated. Researcher Dr Don Ingber said: ‘Sepsis is a major medical threat, which is increasing because of antibiotic resistance. ‘We’re excited about the biospleen because it potentially provides a way to treat patients quickly without having to wait days to identify the source of infection and it works equally well with antibiotic resistant organisms.’ He added that the hopes to start tests on people as soon as possible.","Each year around some 37,000 Britons die of sepsis .

"If you don’t like fruit and veg but want to look after your heart, scientists may have come up with the answer. They have created a ‘tomato pill’ that is bursting with lycopene, the compound credited with many health benefits of the Mediterranean diet. A single Ateronon pill contains as much lycopene – the pigment that gives tomatoes their rich, red colour – as more than 2lb of the fruit. Breakthrough: A single Ateronon pill contains as much lycopene - the pigment that gives tomatoes their rich, red colour - as more than 2lb of the fruit . Now, Cambridge University research has shown the supplement improves blood vessel health in survivors of heart attacks and people with angina and other cardiac problems. In those who took the £1-a-day pill once a day for two months, vital cells that line the inside of blood vessels became healthier. These endothelial cells are key to keeping blood moving through the body – and to warding off future heart attacks and strokes. In those who took the lycopene, blood vessels were able to open more than 50 per cent wider by the end of the study, improving blood flow. By the end of the study, the blood cell lining of the heart patients worked almost as well as that of healthy people. Importantly, the improvement was seen despite the volunteers being on blood pressure pills, statins and other tablets designed to improve heart health, the journal PLOS ONE reports. No effect was seen on the blood vessels of people who were otherwise healthy. The pill, which can be bought on the high street and was created by scientists working for a Cambridge University spin-out company, didn’t affect blood pressure or the flexibility of the arteries. The researchers on the blood vessel study, who aren’t connected to the manufacturer, said that despite the improvement seen, more longer-term studies are needed to show that taking Ateronon cuts the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Study: Cambridge University research has shown the supplement improves blood vessel health in survivors of heart attacks and people with angina and other cardiac problems . However, as lycopene is especially potent when mixed with olive oil, the finding could help explain by a Mediterranean-style seems so good for health. Researcher Dr Joseph Cheriyan, of Cambridge University and the city’s Addenbrooke’s Hospital, said: ‘There's a wealth of research that suggests that the Mediterranean diet - which includes lycopene found in tomatoes and other fruit as a component - is good for our cardiovascular health. ‘But so far, it's been a mystery what the underlying mechanisms could be. ‘We've shown quite clearly that lycopene improves the function of blood vessels in cardiovascular disease patients. It reinforces the need for a healthy diet in people at risk from heart disease and stroke. ‘A daily 'tomato pill' is not a substitute for other treatments, but may provide added benefits when taken alongside other medication.’ The British Heart Foundation, which helped fund the study, said that more work was needed to see if the benefits seen lead to actual improvement to heart health. Other research has credited lycopene with a host of health benefits from warding off prostate cancer to boosting sperm concentration.","Single Ateronon pill contains as much lycopene as more than 2lb of fruit .

"A misplaced mouse-click has been blamed for more than 200 patients temporarily 'killed off' after a major metropolitan hospital accidentally issued death notices to their family doctors. The Austin Health hospital in Heidelberg, in Melbourne's eastern suburbs, mistakenly sent out a fax to more than 200 patients saying they had died. Fortunately, the mistake was realised within hours, and Austin Health contacted each GP to alert them to the mistake and to apologise. Austin Health (left) accidentally writes off more than 200 patients as dead by sending death notices to their family doctors . It's believed GPs were alerted to the error before they had a chance to contact families, but in one case a doctor did call a family member to express their condolences. Austin health sent this letter to GPs stating their patients had died whilst an inpatient at the hospital. The health service has since apologised for the mistake . The blunder was put down to human error and came when a computer file was saved to the wrong location, substituting the death notice for the standard patient discharge form. Austin Heath communications director Taryn Sheehy said, 'Austin Health automatically notifies GPs when their patients are discharged from hospital. 'Notifications sent in the early hours of Wednesday, 30th July, incorrectly advised GPs that their patients, who had been discharged the previous day from the Austin Hospital, had died.' Ms Sheehy said 'we apologise unreservedly to affected clinics who, for the most part, were very understanding about the error.' The mix-up was not linked to the hospital's recent introduction of a new booking system, she said, and at no times did it impact on patient care . A number of GPs in Victoria have accidentally been sent death notices of their patients by Austin Health which has been blamed on human error . Dr. Tony Bartone, president of the Victorian branch of the Australian Medical Association, said the major blunder was just unacceptable. 'IT issues must not undermine patient care or trust in the Victorian healthcare system. Many of these GPs have long relationships with these patients and their families. It would have been distressing to receive such a fax, especially relating to the unexpected death of children and teenagers. It is unacceptable for failings like this to happen.' 'This serves to underline the importance of a strong and robust, state-wide IT health system. Victorians are still being denied this necessary resource.' GPs have been apologised to after Austin Health accidentally sent out death notices regarding their patients . The Victorian Labor Opposition has also weighed in and says the incident is a further sign of a hospital system in crisis. 'They obviously can't take that back, it's symptomatic of a health system that is in crisis, a health system where emergency departments are full,' said Labor leader Daniel Andrews in Melbourne.

"Babies with ‘three parents’ could be created in British laboratories within two years, it emerged yesterday. The UK fertility regulator said there was no evidence that the controversial technique would be unsafe, but called for extra checks before approving it for use. These could take up to two years. However, some leading scientists said that no time is to be lost in changing the law to allow women to be treated. Hope: Babies with 'three parents' could be created in British laboratories within two years, it has emerged. The UK fertility regulator said there was no evidence the IVF controversial technique would be unsafe (file picture) This would make Britain the first . country in the world to sanction the creation of babies that effectively . have three parents – two mothers and a father. Supporters . say it will give couples who have endured the heartache of repeatedly . miscarrying or burying much longed-for children the option of having a . healthy family. But critics argue that genetically engineering eggs and embryos crosses a crucial ethical line. Done differently, it could lead to the creation of ‘perfect’ babies, made to order by hair or eye colour. Mitochondria are tiny powerhouses in cells . that generate energy and have a small amount of their own DNA, separate . from the bulk of the human genetic code. Defects in mitochondrial . DNA (mtDNA) are responsible for a host of inherited diseases, including . conditions leading to muscle wasting, heart problems, loss of vision, . organ failure and epilepsy. MR treatment, which employs two different . IVF techniques, aims to prevent these diseases by giving babies healthy . mtDNA from donor eggs. The baby is born with normal 'nuclear' DNA . passed down by its parents - containing most inherited traits such as . eye and hair colour and height - plus a tiny amount of mtDNA donated by a . second donor 'mother'. In effect the baby has three genetic parents, though the donated mtDNA contains less than 1 per cent of its genes. Since . the healthy mtDNA would be inherited by future generations, the . treatment has the potential to eradicate mitochondrial diseases from . affected families. Critics argue that allowing the treatments could be the first step down a slippery slope towards 'designer babies'. The . controversy surrounds work being carried out at Newcastle University . into incurable diseases caused by mitochondria – the tiny sausage-shaped . powerhouses inside cells that turn food into energy. These . defects cause serious illness in one in 6,500 babies and are . responsible for 50 genetic diseases, many of which kill in infancy. Women . carrying damaged mitochondria can also miscarry repeatedly and often . face the heartbreaking choice of whether it would be best to remain . childless. To help them, . scientists have developed techniques in which the mother-to-be’s . diseased mitochondria are swapped with healthy ones from an egg donated . by another woman. Successful ‘mitochondrial replacement’ would allow the . couple a healthy child that is genetically their own. As the changes . would be passed down the generations, it would also eliminate the . disease from future generations of the family. Any . child would have DNA from two eggs and one sperm – and so effectively . have two mothers and one father - although the genetic contribution from . the donated egg would be very small. The Government has already given . the treatment its backing and published draft rules that will allow it – . if Parliament agrees. And . it had been predicted that the law could be changed by the end of this . year. But yesterday, a study by the fertility watchdog, the Human . Fertilisation & Embryology Authority, urged caution. The . authors said that while they have not seen any evidence that the . techniques are unsafe, crucial research needed to be done, before the . first women are treated. Panel . chairman Dr Andy Greenfield said: ‘The scientific questions that we . examined and the research that we examined – and it was voluminous – . will never answer all of the critical questions. And, of course it won’t . answer the fundamental question, which is are these techniques safe and . efficacious in humans.’ Three parents: The techniques involve replacing defective DNA in the mother's egg with material from a donor egg. This means the resulting healthy child would effectively have two mothers and a father . However, . he added that the same sort of safety questions existed before the . birth of Louise Brown, the world’s first test-tube baby. Dr David King, of campaign group Human Genetics Alert, said the techniques ‘open the door to a designer baby future’. Newcastle . University described the report as ‘very encouraging’ but couldn’t say . when it would be ready to treat the first woman.","Babies with 'three parents' could be created in Britain within two years .

"Finding: Being able to hear the tick-tock of a clock makes women quicken their desire to marry and have children, according to a new U.S. study . It is often said that women have an internal biological clock. But it seems the mere sound of the seconds ticking away can make them focus more on their fertility. A study found that being able to hear the tick-tock of a clock makes women quicken their desire to marry and have children. The subtle reminder that their . fertility is finite may also lead to them lowering their expectations . and settling for what they perceive to be a less successful man. Researchers said that the idea that a woman’s urge and ability to . have a child are controlled by a biological clock is deeply engrained . As such, females may unconsciously associate a ticking sound with their childbearing years slipping away. The U.S. researchers completed two experiments to test the influence of the ticking of a small clock on men and women’s reproductive attitudes. In the first, 59 men and women were asked questions about the age at which they would like to marry and start a family. In the second experiment, they were quizzed on the qualities they look for in husband or wife. They were also asked about how financially secure their childhood was. Those women whose parents were poor were influenced by the ticking sound. The tick-tock led to them wanting to have children earlier and to place less emphasis on a man’s social status and earning power. While it might seem odd that the women’s childhood had an effect, previous studies have shown that a person’s childhood affects how they act as an adult. In particular, those from rich and poor backgrounds can react very differently. The study, published in the journal Human . Nature, also found that women whose parents were well-off became . choosier about a mate when they could hear time ticking away. 'Engrained': Researchers said the idea that a woman's ability to have a child is controlled by a biological clock is deeply engrained. So, females may associate a ticking sound with their childbearing years slipping away . Interestingly, men’s attitude towards settling down and having a family wasn’t influenced by the ticking clock. The Florida State University researchers said: ‘Women’s reproductive capacity is strongly constrained by their age. ‘Unlike men, who can produce offspring until a very old age, women lose their ability to conceive children at menopause. ‘Subtle clues that signal the passage of time – such as the perception of a ticking clock – may signal threats to a woman’s reproductive potential.’","Tick-tock of clock makes women quicken desire to marry and start a family .

"Concern: Professor Mike Sharland has revealed children with minor coughs and colds are being taken straight to A&E units by their parents . Children with minor coughs and colds are being taken straight to accident and emergency units by their parents, a senior government advisor has revealed. Professor Mike Sharland, a consultant at St George’s Hospital in south west London, said most of the children who attend the paediatric A&E unit there have not seen their GP first. He said: ‘That has tipped over into a marked increase in admissions of children with minor infections who are discharged the next day.’ The professor, who advises the Department of Health on antibiotic use, also said that some families ‘bounce’ from hospital to hospital, taking their child to a different A&E every few days. This is because they expect a cold to clear up quickly, when in fact it can take two to three weeks. And, in any case, antibiotics kill bacteria and not the viruses behind colds. Speaking at a London conference on the growing threat of resistance to antibiotics, Professor Sharland said more needs to be done to teach parents about when antibiotics are needed. He told the meeting at the Royal Society: ‘Ninety five per cent of those attending our children’s A&E have no other relation with any other healthcare provider. ‘So they are just pitching up to A&E always around seven or eight o’clock because the child has a fever and sticky eyes and a cough. One of the things we are very aware of is that there is a lot more educating yet to do.’ Other experts said that difficulties in seeing a GP – or even speaking to one on the phone – mean that worried parents see A&E as the best option. Clifford Mann, president of the College . of Emergency Medicine, said that around a third of the children taken to . casualty have coughs and colds or minor injuries such as cuts and . sprains that could be treated elsewhere. 'Bouncing' around: Professor Sharland, a consultant at St George's Hospital in south west London, said that some families 'bounce' from hospital to  hospital, taking their child to a different A&E every few days (file image) He said: ‘It is not uncommon these days for people to go to emergency departments with children who have upper respiratory tract infections – a cough or a cold or an earache. ‘And the vast majority of these cases require nothing more than keeping them warm and giving them fluids and some Calpol.’ He said that rather than wait an hour or two for their family doctor to call them back, parents head for the hospital. Markus Hesseling, a consultant paediatrician in North Wales, and a spokesman for the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH), said: ‘It can be difficult to get a GP appointment at the appropriate time. Treatment: Clifford Mann, the president of the College of Emergency Medicine, said that around a third of the children taken to casualty have coughs and colds or minor injuries that could be treated elsewhere (file image) ‘There is also a wider society reason. Children have become more precious and people move away from their families. You used to have a big family and the granny would say the child would be OK but now people don’t know what to do any more. ‘They might have to wait but A&E is the only place where they can get sorted.’ Stephanie Smith, a RCPCH member and consultant emergency paediatrician in Nottingham, said that some parents struggle to get past their GP’s receptionist and so turn to A&E. She said: ‘We know it can be difficult to get a GP appointment unless you convey the right information, so parents choose a place where the door is open and they can take their child.’ Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer, said that ensuring doctors and the public know when antibiotics should be used is a ‘perpetual problem’.","Professor Mike Sharland said children with colds are being taken to A&E .

"Children born to obese mothers are 50 per cent more likely to end up in hospital in the first five years of their lives. A world-first study by researchers at Griffith University has followed almost 3,000 Queensland mothers and their children over a five-year period. Researchers found conditions of the nervous system, infections, metabolic conditions, perinatal conditions, injuries and respiratory conditions were more prevalent in children of obese mothers. Scroll down for video . Children with obese mums are much more likely to hospitalised in the first five years of their life. Video courtesy of The BMJ . Doctor Cate Cameron said the study, published in the International Journal Of Obesity, is good evidence pre-pregnancy weight has direct effect on complications when getting pregnant. 'We know that there are 1.5 times more hospital admissions in children born to obese mothers than to normal (weight) mothers,' she said. Dr Cate Cameron said hopes the findings will lead to more funding to explore the reasons why there's a link between obese mothers and their children's health . 'We found higher rates of infections and metabolic disorders that came through, but weight didn't seem to be the cause for higher rates of injuries and poisonings.' Doctor Cameron hopes to now secure more funding so her team can analyse genetic material to find out why the health problems occur. 'There's no evidence long term. We have collected cord blood and now have the ability to do further study. We are just in the process of seeking further funding,' she said. She also told Daily Mail Australia the results are not about blaming women. 'We've reached epidemic proportions in obesity,' she said. 'This is a way to help support women lose weight, not another reason to blame them. It's a good indication that we have the potential to reduce health care costs with studies like these, with a goal to achieve better health for us and our children.' Children born to obese mothers are 50% more likely to be hospitalised.  'Pre-pregnancy weight has direct effect on complications when getting pregnant.' Dr Gino Pecoraro, obstetrics spokesman for the Australian Medical Association, welcomed the findings and said they reinforced what we know from other studies. 'In a perfect world every pregnancy would be planned and safe with no medical illness, but that's not the case. From this study we want people to start talking about having children and working towards planning a birth,' she said. Dr Pecoraro said women today are bombarded with a variety of information but education and knowledge to take action is a good thing. 'Whatever we can do as a nation to get people close to the right body weight and image is the best thing we can do. All mothers need to know how to be healthy,' she said. 'We want mothers to be at optimal weight and the study also shows some underweight mothers have problems too. Talk and education is the best thing in reassuring mums to be healthy.' The study, which finds children with obese mum are more likely to be hospitalised in the first five years of their life, is not to blame mothers but to equip them with the information and knowledge to lead a healthy lifestyle. Study co-author Professor Andrew Hills from the Mater Mothers' Hospital in Brisbane, also told ABC News the work was significant because the mothers and children were followed over a period of time. 'This is the million-dollar question. We appreciate that there are significantly heightened risks for folk carrying additional body weight at different stages at life but we know less about the exact mechanism,' he said. Obesity has reached epidemic proportions globally, with at least 2.8 million people dying each year as a result of being overweight or obese.","Children of obese mothers 50% more likely to need hospital treatment before they are five years old .

"Munster dramatically claimed yet another ‘miracle’ European victory as Ian Keatley’s late drop goal sunk gallant Sale, who were on course for a famous win inspired by Danny Cipriani. This was a tale of two halves and two fly-halves. The home side led this Champions Cup, Pool One tie at the AJ Bell Stadium 23-7 at half-time after a masterclass of attacking artistry from Cipriani, who played like a man deserving of an England squad place. Yet, Sale had to play into a strong wind after the break and instead of their No 10 having the last word, it went to his opposite number: Keatley. Jonny Leota barges over for a try in the first half as a rampant Sale raced out to a 23-7 half-time lead . In the Munster tradition established by Ronan O’Gara, Keatley’s sensational swerving shot in stoppage-time settled a mesmerising encounter, which suggests Europe’s new era will contain all the thrills and spills of the old. The clock had reached 80 minutes when the Irish side — urged on by their ‘Red Army’ in the stands — were in the midst of one last assault. Their pack drove deep into Sale territory and worked a position for the drop goal. Yet, to Keatley’s credit, he aborted the attempt under pressure from the Sharks defence. But Munster kept the move alive and seconds later, their stand-off launched a kick into the wind and it arced round like a putt on a sloping green to fly through the posts. Amid the Irish euphoria, Sale’s shattered players lay in a series of dejected heaps. This was a cruel fate after so much heroic effort. Danny Cipriani, who was superb for Sale in the opening 40 minutes, knocks over a penalty . After getting his breath back, Keatley said: ‘It was pretty nervy. For the first attempt, Chris Cusiter chased me down so I had to pass it on. But the lads got me in a great position again and thankfully it went over. As the 10, it is your responsibility and you have to take that on your shoulders. Thankfully I did all the practice and it paid off.’ In the opening period, despite Dave Kilcoyne’s early try, Munster were under the cosh as Sale ran amok on the back of Cipriani’s astute prompting. His distribution and running were sublime, but he also defended resolutely and was immaculate with his goal-kicking — scoring 16 points and not missing any of his six shots. He endured one or two decision- making wobbles in the second half when his team were struggling, but overall this was a compelling Test audition. All the indications last week were that Cipriani is destined to miss out on a place in the England squad to be announced on Wednesday, but this performance may force a late re-think by Stuart Lancaster and his assistants. Munster centre Andrew Smith takes on the Sale defence as the Irish province began their fight-back . With seconds of the game remaining, Keatley sits back in the pocket and attempts a 40-metre drop goal . Conor Murray (left), Paul O'Connell and Tommy O'Donnell look on as Ian Keatley (right) fires over his drop goal . ‘Cipriani was outstanding for us,’ said Sale’s director of rugby, Steve Diamond. ‘Any contentious opinions about his goal-kicking were put to rest today and he put his tackles in too — 12 or 13 of them. ‘He is playing really well and if the England coaches select him, he won’t let them down.’ Magnus Lund touched down from close-range for the hosts in the 24th minute and five minutes later, Sale surged clear when Johnny Leota seized on Tom Brady’s deft pass and swept over in the left corner. Keatley is mobbed by JJ Hanrahan after his last-ditch kick goes over as Cipriani (left) digests the defeat . Diamond’s men were denied a possible penalty try when Tommy O’Donnell was sin-binned for an off-the-ball tackle and after half-time, Leota ignored an overlap but was unable to score his second try. Ultimately, that was decisive as Munster reverted to a power game and tries by Andrew Conway and Conor Murray set up a grandstand finish. Another Cipriani penalty was soon cancelled out by Keatley, who then delivered the winning shot shortly after. ‘That was a brutal way to go down,’ said Sale captain Dave Seymour. It most certainly was. Now the Cheshire club must brace themselves for the daunting prospect of a trip to Clermont Auvergne, while Munster will await Saracens on Friday night, buoyed by their latest escape act.","Sale led 23-7 at half-time as Magnus Lund and Jonny Leota crossed for tries .

"Controversy: Alessandra Mussolini's husband has been caught up in in a police investigation into underage prostitution . The granddaughter of fascist leader Benito Mussolini has been inadvertently caught up in a schoolgirl sex scandal that has caused shockwaves across Italy. The husband of politician Alessandra Mussolini is accused of using teenage prostitutes from affluent backgrounds, who sold their bodies for extra pocket money to buy designer clothes. Revelations that the girls made after school appointments with male clients, near their homes in Parioli, the capital's most well-heeled district, have shocked Rome’s upper middle classes. The pair aged 14 and 15 charged up to 300 euros a time. Prostitution is not against the law in Italy but it is illegal to have sex with a prostitute under the age of 18. Now police poring through the girls’ mobile phone records have compiled a list of 20 suspects, including Mauro Floriani, Mrs Mussolini’s husband of more than 20 years. Mr Floriani, a former police officer in the tax and customs division, nicknamed Captain Mussolini, gave himself up to the authorities but denies having sex with either girl. He was questioned and remains under investigation. The former police officer has three children with the granddaughter of Il Duce, a former actress who is a niece of Sixties sex symbol Sophia Loren. In 1990 Alessandra Mussolini gave up acting and went into politics. She is now an MP in Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia party. Former Italian premier Berlusconi is currently appealing a conviction for sex with underage prostitute Ruby the Heartstealer.

"A new study carried out at Reading University has found rainwater-filled water barrels provide a fertile breeding ground for mosquitoes capable of carrying malaria and other diseases . They are a must-have for keen gardeners. But trendy water butts are also a magnet for mosquitoes, experts have warned. The rainwater-filled water barrels provide a fertile breeding ground for mosquitoes capable of carrying malaria and other diseases, a British study found. Worryingly, water butts in population-dense towns and cities are particularly suited to incubating the insect’s larvae, raising the chances of an outbreak. Although malaria is unlikely to take hold here, the insects could spread it from person to person - something that has not happened in the UK since the 1950s. Anopheles, one of the types of mosquito found to favour urban water barrels, carries the most deadly form of the malaria. Study author Amanda Callaghan, of Reading University, told the BBC: ‘The main finding is that these mosquitoes are right next to people’s houses and the Anopheles mosquito we found is a human-biting species and it can transmit malaria. ‘Therefore, if someone comes back from their holiday with malaria and they get bitten, it could be transmitted to another person – and that is how you get outbreaks.’ Malaria is found in more than 100 countries and some 1,500 holidaymakers bring it back with them each year. Mosquito bites can also cause allergies, infections and just be plain irritating. Water butts – barrels that collect rainwater from the gutters – are increasingly popular with gardeners keen to give their plants soft, untreated water. They also help with water conservation and get round hosepipe bans. But the dark, stagnant water warmed by the sun is also attractive to mosquitoes, which lay their eggs on it. Once hatched the larvae feast on the rotting leaves, beetles and other insects that are washed into it with the rainwater. Dr Callaghan’s experiments showed . that the insects breed more quickly in barrels placed in the town than . in the country and so are present in higher numbers. It . is thought this is because the surrounding bricks and concrete trapped . heat, raising the temperature of the water by a degree or so, and . speeding up the insect’s lifecycle. Anopheles, one of the types of mosquito found to favour urban water barrels, carries the most deadly form of the malaria . Writing in the journal PLOS ONE, Dr Callaghan, a zoologist, said: ‘Although each water butt only provides 50-250 litres (11-55 gallons) of water, when combined, containers may provide a large area and create a network of easily accessible prime mosquito habitat. She added that the risk of infection is very low – but people should be aware of it. To keep the insects at bay, Dr Callaghan advises buying barrels with tight lids and completely emptying them once a month. Mosquitoes can also be deterred by pouring a layer of vegetable oil on top of the water or adding some crushed garlic. If all else fails, larvae be fed to fish in the garden pond. Jacob Tompkins, of water conservation charity Waterwise, said that while water barrels are a potential breeding ground for mosquitoes, there are many more attractive places. He added: ‘If you are worried, put a lid on the barrel, or put a spoonful of olive oil on top of the water twice a year.’","New study carried out at Reading University warns of dangers of troughs .

Damaged buildings where an aircraft crashed, in the residential area Na Rua Vahia de Abreu in Santos, Sao Paulo state, Brazil . It was reportedly cloudy and raining when the jet crashed into houses in the port city of Santos, 43 miles east of Sao Paulo in south-east Brazil. According to reports, the other six people travelling with him on the plane were also killed, as well as at least four people on the ground. The other people on board the plane who were killed in the crash were the two pilots, Campos' private secretary and press officer, and a photographer and a cameraman documenting his election campaign. Logistics analyst Tassio Silva, 25, who witnessed the accident said the plane 'fell nose first' at an angle of 65 degrees. He said: 'I work 200 metres from where the plane came down. My desk is in front of the window. I was stunned, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. There was an explosion and a lot of smoke. The emergency crews arrived quickly.' Campos had hours earlier given an interview on Brazil's main news programme, Jornal Nacional, where he had promised free public transport for state school student, to increase public health care spending by ten per cent and to increase national security budget by ten-fold.

"A financial whiz who combined a successful City career with raising her six children has blamed exhausted stay-at-home mothers who prefer to stay in at night for the failure of her first restaurant . Fund manager Nicola Horlick says she had to close Georgina's, her bistro in Barnes, south west London, after 18 months because the area was 'full of mothers with children who don't go out much at night'. The 53-year-old multi-millionaire, who named the business after her eldest daughter who died of leukaemia in 1998, says she wasn't making a profit because the restaurant wasn't doing enough trade at night. She also cited 'outrageous' business rates in the smart suburb for the restaurant's failure and blamed local estate agents for pushing them up. Fund manager Nicola Horlick, 53, blames the closure of her Barnes restaurant on 'mothers who don't go out' Closed after 18 months: Horlick named her restaurant after her eldest daughter, who died of leukaemia . Horlick said that while her cream-painted canteen did a roaring lunchtime trade, it was not doing enough covers in the evenings to make money. 'I have learnt a lot of lessons,' she said.  'The problem is Barnes if full of mothers with children who don't go out much at night. 'So although we were doing 200 lunches on a Saturday and breaking even, I need to give a proper return to shareholders.' Horlick is now planning to try again in nearby Chiswick, where - although it, too, is home to a large population of 'yummy mummies' - she believes she has found more suitable premises. She intends to be open in time for Valentine's Day and says she has six chefs and six front-of-house staff already lined up.

When she launched it in spring 2012, Horlick said she intended to fill a hole in the market by offering good food at breakfast and lunchtimes, as well as dinner in the evenings. She told bighospitality.co.uk: 'There will be amazing homemade granolas and yogurts in the morning and then fantastic salads at lunchtime but a full service dinner in the evening. 'A lot of restaurants in London do very, very little trade at lunchtime and don't do any breakfast or teatime trade and that is actually rather a waste when costs are so incredibly high.' She added: 'I wouldn't do it unless I thought it was a good business proposition because there is no point otherwise.' 'Full of mothers': Barnes, with its pond and coffee shops, is a popular place for families in south west London . Georgina's was well-received by diners in Barnes, who wrote enthusiastic reviews on the TopTable website. 'Went . here for dinner and the food was amazing!', wrote one.  'Really liked . the decor too, simplistic but stylish -  would definitely return and try . the brunch that I've heard is yummy.' Another wrote: 'A really good spot for a light, healthy lunch.  Highly recommended.' Born in December 1960 to Michael Gayford and his Polish wife, Suzanna, Nicola was educated at Cheltenham Ladies' College and Birkenhead High School before studying law at Oxford. In 1983 she joined SG Warburg as a graduate trainee, and rose to director level before joining Morgan Grenfell Asset Management nine years later. Meanwhile, she had married financier Tim Horlick in 1984, an old friend from Oxford, and had her first child, Georgina, in 1986. Horlick brought the Midas touch to Morgan Grenfell, turning the company upside-down, dramatically increasing its profits, and earning herself £1.5million a year - a vast sum 16 years ago - for her work. Role model: In the mid-1990s, Nicola Horlick appeared to be the working City mother who had it all . When Morgan Grenfell sacked Horlick, she flew to their Frankfurt HQ - with 40 journalists in tow - to ask why . But it was in 1997 that she earned herself the 'Superwoman' tag when, after being sacked from Morgan Grenfell, she summoned a pack of 40 journalists and flew with them to the company's Frankfurt offices to demand her job back. At 36, she already had five children, one of whom was seriously ill, to cope with alongside her high-powered job, but the country was entranced by the supermother who wouldn't take no for an answer. Ultimately, though, she did, and went off alone, setting up SG Asset Management in 1997, the year before her daughter died of leukaemia, and then Bramdean Asset Management in 2005. In 2005 Horlick got divorced and met journalist Martin Baker, when he came to interview her for the Sunday Telegraph.  She and Baker married the following year, and they live together in Barnes. After her first marriage ended in divorce, Horlick found love with newspaper journalist Martin Baker . Horlick's independent career appeared to be coasting when, in 2008, she lost £12million of investors' money to fraudster Bernie Madoff and his Ponzi scam. Since then, she has launched the Rockpool investment company, gone into film production with Derby Street films, and joined the board of an NHS trust. Two months ago she announced plans to launch a crowdfunding venture, a website called Money&Co, in early 2014.

"A Brazilian man whose parents were African slaves could be the oldest living person ever documented after receiving a birth certificate showing he turned 126 last week, it was reported today. Jose Aguinelo dos Santos was born on July 7, 1888, just two months after slavery was abolished in Brazil - the last country in the world to outlaw the trade. Yet the batchelor, who never married or had children, still walks without a stick, eats four meals a day and has no health problems - despite smoking a packet of cigarettes a day for the last 50 years. 126 not out: Jose Aguinelo dos Santos, who claims he was born on July 7, 1888, could be the oldest living person ever . Mr dos Santos was born just two months after slavery was abolished in Brazil - the last country in the world to outlaw the trade . Jose - known simply as Ze - was 26 when World War I broke out, and already a pensioner at 65 when Queen Elizabeth II ascended to the British throne. He was 52 when Brazil football legend Pele was born - and 62 when Brazil last hosted the World Cup, in 1950. One of five children to an African slave woman, Jose was born in a slave compound in the town of Pedra Branca in the state of Ceara, north-east Brazil. He was among hundreds of slave families who continued to live there, even after being granted their freedom. He later travelled south to the state of Sao Paulo, where he spent most of his life working on a coffee plantation in the town of Bauru. Now a resident of an old people's home in the same town, Jose likes to tell jokes and sing, hates having a bath, and never misses his daily plate of rice and beans. Mr dos Santos spent most of his life working on a coffee plantation in the town of Bauru. He now lives in and old people's home .

'If I got to this age it's because I've lived a lot, that's all.' Mariana Silva, psychologist at the Vila Vicentina home, said Jose has no health problems and is so lucid he still amuses other residents by cracking one-liners. She said: 'He's one of our most with-it residents. 'He doesn't have high cholesterol, diabetes or high blood pressure. The only medicine he takes are vitamins and a tablet to give him an appetite, which you can lose with old age. 'When he's on his own he likes to sing. None of us know the songs he sings. They're from a time no-one else remembers. 'He doesn't like to take a bath every day and it's sometimes impossible to get him to the shower. When he puts his foot down, that's it. No-one can get him in there.' Jose, who arrived at the home in 2001, received his birth certificate last month after living his entire life without any documents. A team of experts arrived on his birth date after researching his past and interviewing him about his earliest memories, during which he was able to describe the slave compound perfectly.

The home's president, Jose Roberto Pires, said they are determined to do the test even though it costs around £13,000. But he added: 'We are trying to find a way to do it without having to pay.

"Justin Bieber has been charged with illegally scrawling graffiti on the wall of a £23 million hotel in Rio de Janiero. As . well as childish drawings of faces and baseball caps, the teen star . scribbled phrases such as 'Bielibers 4 life' and 'respect privacy' on . the side of the property in upmarket district of Sao Conrado. A police spokesman described the case as a misdemeanor which will be forwarded to a small-claims court where the Canadian pop star, who flew out of the country on a private jet yesterday, faces a fine.

A . police probe subsequently established that the 19-year-old pop star had . received permission from City Hall to tag a wall at another location, . the Olympic Village in the Vidigal shantytown. But Bieber's entourage felt he would not be safe there. 'The permission from City Hall did not extend to other locations,' a police statement said.

"Argentinian football thugs are planning to ambush and attack England fans during the World Cup, police have warned. More than 650 violent 'ultras' are believed to be travelling to the tournament in Brazil from neighbouring Argentina, according to reports. Many are heading to Belo Horizonte, where Argentina will be based and where both sides play group games just days apart later this month. Battle: Argentinian thugs are planning to ambush and attack England fans during the World Cup in Brazil . Police in the city suggested that members of the notorious Argentinian Barra Brava groups have made alliances with equally violent Brazilian ultras - and are preparing attacks on rival England fans. One Brazilian ultra group, Mafia Azul, have reportedly rented a ranch on the outskirts of the city in southeast Brazil to accommodate dozens of Barras Bravas linked to Argentinian club San Lorenzo. The Mafia Azul group, linked to Belo Horizonte side and current league leaders Cruzeiro, were banned from stadiums in Brazil earlier this year after violent confrontations with rival fans which left several people dead. Miliary police chief Col Divino Brito told Brazil's Estado de Minas newspaper he believes Argentinian and Brazilian soccer thugs are preparing to team up to attack English fans while they are in town. No strangers: Violence has followed England supporters around in tournaments over the last two decades . He said: 'Our worry is that in the interval between one match and another, when we are going to have thousands of fans from Argentina and then from England, there are going to be clashes. 'We will deal forcefully with any foreigner who comes here wanting to commit violence and vandalism.' But Col Alberto Luiz Alves admitted: 'We can normally monitor groups with a history of violence. 'But we would only know of dangerous fans if they enter by air, and in the case of the Argentinian Barra Bravas most will be arriving by land. It will be very difficult to keep track of them.' At least 11,000 Argentinian fans have bought tickets to see their side play Iran on June 21 in Belo Horizonte. Never forget: Debora Hambo, a lawyer . representing the Barras Bravas, warned that Argentinian fans were . preparing to face the English in Brazil - in revenge for losing the . conflict over the Falkland Islands, pictured . Three days later, over 7,500 England fans are expected in the city in southeast Brazil for their final group game against Costa Rica. The Barras Bravas are known as some of the world's most violent supporters, and have been blamed for at least 120 football-related deaths in Argentina in the past 20 years. Earlier this year Debora Hambo, a lawyer representing the Barras Bravas, warned that Argentinian fans were preparing to face the English in Brazil - in revenge for losing the Falklands War. Supposedly relaying a message from the group's leader, she said: 'The Argentine people have a good memory and they will never forget nor forgive. 'We will always remember what happened in 1982.' She added: 'They are not cowards. They are not concerned about their physical integrity. It doesn't matter to them, they risk their lives every minute. 'They are brave beyond life and death. That is why they have a violent reputation.'","Hundreds of Argentinian football thugs planning to attack England fans .

"A Brazilian teenager told today how he got through tight security to meet England players at the team's Rio hotel - just by waving an out-of-date room key card he'd found on the street. Abraao Paiva de Mesquita, 18, claimed he walked straight past police, army troops and security staff at the Royal Tulip hotel to make it to the outdoor swimming pool, where members of the squad were relaxing.

'I went straight past hotel reception no questions asked, just saying good afternoon to people along the way.' He said he would wait in a corridor leading to the hotel swimming pool, knowing the England players would have to walk past him.

It is in Rio's Sao Conrado district, is just streets away from the sprawling Rocinha slum . The England team arrived at their team hotel,the Royal Tulip Hotel, Sao Conrado, Rio de Janeiro,Brazil under an armed guard . He said: 'Football players are human too. I knew they wouldn't see me there and completely ignore me.' Abraao also took selfies with Gary Cahill, Danny Welbeck, Jack Wilshire and Joe Hart. He said: 'I learned a bit of English before I arrived. I just said, 'photo, I and you' and they would oblige. When Joe Hart passed by I said, 'Give me your shirt. I am your fan'. 'I didn't get the photo I really wanted though, with Wayne Rooney. I'm hoping to find him before they leave. It's going to be a bit more difficult now though, now the security guards know who I am.' After being chosen by Roy Hodgson as England's base during their stay in Brazil, hotel bosses at the Royal Tulip pledged to tighten security to ensure the safety of players. The five star hotel, in Rio's Sao Conrado district, is just streets away from the sprawling Rocinha slum, the scene of frequent gun battles between drug gangs and the police in recent months. In 2010 gang members on the run from police stormed the hotel, taking 35 people hostage. One woman was killed in crossfire. Hotel bosses say it has undergone a £2million revamp, with the players' rooms enjoying new furniture, beds, flooring and air conditioning.","Abraao Paiva de Mesquita, 18, claimed he walked straight in .

"A father has accused a doctor of stealing the baby from his wife's womb after she awoke from a C-section to be told her pregnancy had been ‘imaginary’, it was reported today. Brazilian Claudia Aparecida Lopes, 30, claimed she attended all her pre-natal appointments and even had two ultra-sound scans. The last scan, at nine months, even showed the baby was in a breech position and needed to be delivered by caesarean, her family said. Anger: Claudia Aparecida Lopes claims that her baby was stolen by doctors after a caesarean (file picture) But when she woke up from the procedure at a hospital in Alto Paranaiba, southeast Brazil, Ms Lopes was told there had never been a baby in her womb and she had imagined the pregnancy. Ms Lopes husband, Alexandro Donizete Alves, 23, who reported the case to police, told Brazil's G1 website he is ‘indignant’ and needs to know what really happened to his son, who would be the couple's third child. He said: ‘My wife did a pregnancy test at the chemist and it was positive. So we made a doctor's appointment, and he confirmed the pregnancy, even telling us it was a boy. ‘We paid for pre-natal treatment and even went for ultrasound scans. ‘During one of the two scans the doctor told us the birth couldn't be natural because the child was sitting down, and it needed to be a caesarean. He said his mother went with Ms Lopes for the operation at the Santa Terezinha hospital on Monday. He said: ‘My mother was waiting outside the operating room to be called, when the news came that it was just an imaginary pregnancy, that there had never been a baby in there, despite everything. Phantom claim: Ms Lopes was told by doctors at a hospital in Alto Paranaiba, southeast Brazil, that she'd imagined the pregnancy . ‘My wife had a huge cut across her belly and they simply told us that there wasn't a baby after all, it was all psychological. That's when I called the police and registered the occurrence.’ He said the doctor who performed the operation, Jose Tomaz de Oliveira, had seen his wife at the end of December and had even prescribed vitamins designed for pregnant mothers. He said: ‘If the pregnancy was psychological, how come he accompanied the whole pregnancy. If it's true, then I must have psychological problems too, because I saw the child on the ultrasound and so did he.’ ‘I need to know if my son was in there, and what happened to him. I was the father and I have this right. ‘Caesarean is a serious thing and you can't go opening up a person without knowing for sure. ‘The bedroom was all decorated ready for the baby to arrive, then we're told he never existed at all. No-one can believe this is happening.’ Dr Oliveira, by email, told the G1 website that he had only seen Ms Lopes twice and hadn't personally done the ultrasound scans. He added that the hospital had already handed over records to police and couldn't comment further on the case. Civil police chief Claudia Coelho Franchi confirmed he had ordered an investigation into the case, including tests to find out if Ms Lopes had been pregnant. He said: ‘We're going to hear witnesses and examine all the documents. The inquiry will be concluded in 30 days, but it is too early to draw any conclusions.’ Alexandre Rodrigues, from the Medical Council of Minas Gerais state (CRM-MG), said an internal inquiry had also been launched. He said: ‘At the moment I don't know who falsified what. We don't yet know why a caesarian was carried out and everything has to be investigated. ‘We could we dealing with a psychiatrically-disturbed patient. The investigation is to find out exactly where and in what moment the error occurred. ‘We will examine the two ultrasound scans presented by the patient and find out if the doctor carried out the caesarian just on the basis of seeing the scans. We have the testimonies of both parties and they will be investigated.’ This week's case is the latest of a number of disturbing similar recent incidents in Brazil. Last month a ‘heavily-pregnant’ woman was also told she'd had a ‘phantom pregnancy’ after also waking up from a C-section at a hospital in Cabo Frio, in the state of Rio de Janeiro. The 37-year-old woman had reportedly arrived at the town's women's hospital with a large belly and proof of her pre-natal treatment, which showed she was 41 weeks' pregnant. And in December last year another Brazilian woman, Layane Santos, accused a hospital in Sao Paulo from stealing the baby from her room during a caesarean. The 19-year-old had received pre-natal treatment during her entire pregnancy, with nurses recording the growing size of her baby and even measuring the foetal heart beats. According to reports, Ms Santos even had an ultra-sound in the final week of her pregnancy, which showed he was carrying a baby girl who weighed albs and measured 42cm.","Brazilian Claudia Aparecida Lopes claims she had two ultra-sound scans .

Witnesses . claim a group of men snatched Mr Santos - who recently retired from . football after a successful career playing for teams in Rio de Janeiro - . as he was closing his shop late on Monday night. Ms . Silva, a police social worker, found her husband's severed head - minus . his eyes and tongue - after opening the rucksack which was dumped on . the doorstep of the couple's home at around 5.30am the next morning. Yesterday police said body parts, believed to belong to the footballer, had . been discovered beside the Guandu river in Queimados, greater Rio de . Janeiro. Mr Santos' brother-in-law told Brazil's Globo G1 website that family members had . positively identified the male torso because of a birth mark on Mr . Santos' stomach. Beheaded: The head of former footballer Joao Rodrigo Silva Santos, was found on his wife's doorstep . He also told the website that the player's wife, Geisa Silva, 31, stayed up all night after her husband failed to arrive home. He said: 'Every time a car passed by she would go to see. 'She was getting ready to go to work at around 5.30am when she heard a noise, opened the front door and saw his rucksack. 'When she opened it she discovered it contained his head. 'I did not want to look but the people who saw it said they had gouged out his eyes and cut off his tongue,' said the horrified relative. Neighbours living close to the crime scene reported hearing a woman screaming: 'My God, it's Joao! It’s Joao’s head.' A police spokesman said other body parts had also been found in the area and were being DNA tested. He said the murder bears the . hallmarks of an execution by drug gangsters, but stressed that ""every . line of investigation"" is still open. The couple had been together for 11 years and were described as ‘lovely’ by neighbours. 'They . were a happy, quiet couple,' said a neighbour, who asked not to be . identified. 'But you never know what may have motivated a crime as . stupid and as senseless as this.' Crime . ridden: Brazil still has an alarmingly high murder rate, and armed . thefts and carjackings continue to be facts of daily life . Mr Santos’ played as a professional footballer between 1996 and 2005 - during which he scored 33 goals in 103 matches as a striker. Nicknamed Humble Hero, he was signed to a number of second division teams. He also played abroad for Swedish Club Oster Vaxjo  and Olimpia in Honduras. A recent United Nations report into drug trafficking-related crime in Brazil found that more than half of the homicides, robberies and thefts have a direct or indirect link with this criminal activity.","Witnesses saw armed men kidnap Joao Rodrigo Silva Santos on Monday .

"A river of caramel is threatening to engulf a Brazilian town after a warehouse fire melted more than 30,000 tonnes of sugar. Firefighters were today still battling to control the blaze 70 hours after it started at the industrial site in Santa Adelia, Sao Paulo. The fire swept through the warehouse - which supplies sugar to the entire state - causing streams of caramel to flow out . of the building, onto roads and towards people's homes. Threat: A river of caramel is threatening to engulf a Brazilian town after a fire at a sugar warehouse . Concern: Hundreds of locals have already been moved from their homes for fear of being engulfed in caramel . Hundreds of locals have already been moved from their houses into hotels for fear of being engulfed in the sugary substance - with others barricading their doors with sandbags and earth. The free-flowing caramel is also believed to have contaminated a local river - with dead fish appearing as far as five miles from the blaze. However, workers' efforts to stop the caramel from spreading have been hampered by the fact it is thick and cannot be siphoned off like water, police told G1. The blaze, which struck the warehouse - owned by distributor Agrovia - on Friday, is believed to have started on a loading conveyor chain. Battle: Firefighters were today still tackling the blaze at the industrial site in Santa Adelia, Sao Paulo . Locals have been warned that many more tonnes of sugar are still expected to be burned at the plant, and that they should prepare for the worst. As well as supplying Brazilian towns with sugar, Agrovia's plant in Santa Adelia exports 1.7million tonnes of the product around the world. Last week, another fire at a warehouse belonging to Copersucar, Brazil's biggest sugar exporter, at Sao Paulo's port of Santos, destroyed 180,000 tonnes of sugar.","Firefighters are still battling blaze at sugar warehouse in Santa Adelia, Brazil .

"Police in Brazil have smashed a high-end prostitution ring that delivered well-known Brazilian models and cover girls to businessmen and politicians in Europe and Africa, it was reported today. The women, who according to police appeared regularly on Brazilian TV and in men's magazines, are believed to have been paid as much as £60,000 a week, investigators said. Police claim the gang transported as many as 90 women a year from Brazil to wealthy clients in Angola, South Africa, Portugal and Austria in a racket believed to have amassed them over £28 million since 2007. Double-life: Police said many of the unnamed women, worked as dancers, models or actresses. (File photo of an unconnected dancer) Federal police officers moved in on the gang yesterday following a year-long investigation, arresting three men and two women in the state of Sao Paulo, southeast Brazil. The two female suspects are alleged to have approached and recruited the women. Eleven luxury cars, as well as 23 passports, 14 visa requests for travel to Angola, foreign money and drugs were also seized, police said. Police chief Luiz Tempestini, who led the investigation, told Brazil's O Globo newspaper that many of the women, who have not been named, worked as dancers, models or actresses on popular Brazilian TV shows. Mr Tempestini said once abroad the women were told they needed to have relations with the men without protection in order to earn the large amount they had been promised. Some of the women were held against their will, he added. Sting: Detectives swooped following a year-long investigation, arresting three men and two women in the state of Sao Paulo, pictured, southeast Brazil . Once back in Brazil victims were allegedly offered a cocktail of anti-Aids drugs, which were in fact fake placebo pills. He added that two groups of four to five women were sent abroad every month, for a week to ten days at a time, with Angola being the most frequent destination. He said: 'The first group was made of women who were recruited from a high-class prostitution house in a wealthy area of Sao Paulo, who earned around $10,000 (£6,000) per week. 'The second group was formed of models featured on the covers of men's magazines or who worked on TV programmes. They would make as much as $100,000 (£60,000) for the same period.' Mr Tempestini said that among the group's clients was a well-known Angolan businessman and a former Angolan politician. The gang members who were arrested have been charged with participation in organised crime, international people trafficking, embezzlement, false imprisonment and endangering the health and life of others, and face a maximum jail term of 30 years. Two other suspects wanted by Brazilian police and believed to be living outside the country were placed on Interpol's red notice list.","Women were dancers, models or actresses on popular Brazilian TV shows .

"Argentinian football thugs are planning to ambush and attack England fans during the World Cup, police warned today. More than 650 violent 'ultras' are believed to be travelling to the competition in Brazil from neighbouring Argentina, according to reports. Many are heading to Belo Horizonte, where Argentina will be based during the tournament and where England and Argentina play group games just days apart later this month. Argentinian football thugs are planning to ambush and attack England fans during the World Cup in Brazil, according to reports . Police in the city warned today that members of the notorious Argentinian Barra Brava groups have made alliances with equally violent Brazilian ultras - and are preparing attacks on rival England fans during the tournament. One Brazilian ultra group, Mafia Azul, have reportedly rented a ranch on the outskirts of the city in southeast Brazil to accommodate dozens of Barras Bravas linked to Argentinian club San Lorenzo. The Mafia Azul group, linked to Belo Horizonte side and current league leaders Cruzeiro, were earlier this year banned from stadiums in Brazil after violent confrontations with rival fans which left several people dead. Miliary police chief Col Divino Brito told Brazil's Estado de Minas newspaper he believes Argentinian and Brazilian soccer thugs are preparing to team up to attack English fans while they are in town. England fans, pictured during clashes in Brussels in Euro 2000, have been warned they could be attacked by Argentinian football thugs when they travel to the Brazilian city of Belo Horizonte during the World Cup . He said: 'Our worry is that in the interval between one match and another, when we are going to have thousands of fans from Argentina and then from England, there are going to be clashes. 'We will deal forcefully with any foreigner who comes here wanting to commit violence and vandalism.' But Col Alberto Luiz Alves admitted: 'We can normally monitor groups with a history of violence. 'But we would only know of dangerous fans if they enter by air, and in the case of the Argentinian Barra Bravas most will be arriving by land. It will be very difficult to keep track of them.' At least 11,000 Argentinian fans have bought tickets to see their side play Iran on June 21 in Belo Horizonte, where the Argentina squad will also be based during the tournament. Earlier this year Debora Hambo, a lawyer representing the Barras Bravas, warned that Argentinian fans were preparing to face the English in Brazil - in revenge for losing the conflict over the Falkland Islands, pictured . Three days later, over 7,500 England fans are expected in the city in southeast Brazil for their final group game against Costa Rica. The Barras Bravas are known as some of the world's most violent football fans, and have been blamed for at least 120 soccer-related deaths in Argentina in the past 20 years. Earlier this year Debora Hambo, a lawyer representing the Barras Bravas, warned that Argentinian fans were preparing to face the English in Brazil - in revenge for losing the Falklands War. Supposedly relaying a message from the group's leader, she said: 'The Argentine people have a good memory and they will never forget nor forgive. We will always remember what happened in 1982. She added: 'They are not cowards. They are not concerned about their physical integrity. It doesn't matter to them, they risk their lives every minute. 'They are brave beyond life and death. That is why they have a violent reputation.'","Hundreds of Argentinian football thugs planning to attack England fans .

"Authorities in Brazil have denounced church leaders as criminals for chopping down more than 300 centuries-old trees in a national park - so pilgrims can celebrate mass during the Pope’s visit to Rio de Janeiro. Pope Francis will make his first international trip to the world’s largest Roman Catholic country later this month. Organisers of an event in the diocese of Sao Sebastiao de Itaipu, in the city of Niteroi, claimed they needed to clear an area of Atlantic rainforest to accommodate the expected crowd of up to 800 pilgrims. Axed: A total of 334 trees at the edge of the Serra da Tiririca national park (file picture), but also on church-owned land, were felled in Brazil . Upset: Niteroi's vice-mayor claimed the church did not seek permission to 'deforest' the land on the edge of the national park (file picture) A total of 334 trees at the edge of the Serra da Tiririca national park, but also on church-owned land, were felled. Niteroi's vice-mayor, Axel Grael, claimed the church did not seek permission to ‘deforest’ the land. He told Brazil's O Globo newspaper: ‘The incident is lamentable. An event for youth should be educational and demonstrate a commitment to the environment and the future. This removal is a criminal act.’ Andre Ilha, from Rio de Janeiro's state environment institute - which is responsible for the forest - said the destruction would never have been allowed. Travels: Pope Francis (pictured on July 7 at the Vatican) will make his first international trip to the world's largest Roman Catholic country later this month . He said: ‘What was razed was the buffer zone of the Tiririca park. We would never have authorised that. It is a fragment of the endangered Atlantic rainforest. We will charge them with a crime.’ 'The incident is lamentable. An event for youth should be educational and demonstrate a commitment to the environment and the future' Axel Grael, Niteroi's vice-mayor . The diocese has reportedly offered to replant trees in the area following the event. It is not the first time World Youth Day organisers have been criticised for a disregard for the environment. Earlier this month a petition was made to Rio de Janeiro's council to remove 11 coconut trees from the side of Leme beach, where the Pope is due to celebrate mass. Permission was granted, but after an outcry Rio's mayor Eduardo Paes reversed the decision.","Pope Francis to visit world's largest Roman Catholic country this month .

"Argentina has made a formal complaint to its neighbour Uruguay after the country's president called his female Argentine counterpart an 'old hag'. The famously candid Jose Mujica had no idea his microphone was switched on when he attacked Cristina Fernandez . de Kirchner, 60, moments before a press conference. He was heard loudly: 'That old hag's worse than the cross-eyed one,' referring to Ms Kirchner's late husband and former Argentinian president Nestor Kirchner. The 77-year-old added: 'Cross-eyes was more of a politician, she's just stubborn.' Complaint: Argentina has made a formal protest after Uruguay's President Jose Mujica (left) referred to Argentine President Cristina Kirchner as an 'old hag' Meeting: This picture shows Mr Mujica meeting with Ms Kirchner and Nestor Kirchner (left) in Buenos Aires in 2008. Mr Kirchner died of heart failure in 2010 . Pouring scorn on his colleague, who has spoken out repeatedly to attack Britain over The Falklands, 77-year-old Mr Mujica then accused of failing to act appropriately when meeting the pope. Ms Kirchner presented the Argentinian Pope Francisco with a flask to drink traditional 'mate' tea when she visited last month. Mr Mujica said: 'She actually went to the Pope, who has lived 77 years, to explain what is tea and what is a thermal flask.' Argentina's foreign minister Hector Timermanmade a formal protest to the Uruguayan government about Mr Mujica's 'outrageous' remarks about the country's current and former presidents. Remarks: Mr Mujica was also overheard referring to late Argentine President Nestor Kirchner as 'cross-eyed' In a statement handed to Uruguayan Ambassador Guillermo Pomi he stressed Argentina's 'profound unease with the terms' used by Mr Mujica. He said: 'It is unacceptable that such outrageous comments, which offend the memory of a deceased person who cannot defend himself, have been made by someone Kirchner considered her friend.' Relations between the two South American countries have deteriorated in recent years as Ms Kirchner has restricted imports and limited access to foreign currencies, measures which have hurt Uruguay's exports and tourism industry. Nestor Kirchner accused Uruguay of 'stabbing Argentina in the back' in 2007 after president Tabare Vazquez restarted operations at a pulp mill on a river bordering the two countries which Argentina had blockaded. In 2002 Uruguayan president Jorge Batlle accused Argentinians of being 'a bunch of thieves,' a comment for which he later apologised during a trip to Buenos Aires. Mr Mujica, a former guerrilla who took office in 2010, last night insisted he had not spoken publically about the Kirchners at the event in Uruguay and would not be offering clarifications. He made headlines in June 2012, when his government made a move to legalize state-controlled sales of marijuana. He reportedly said that by regulating the $40 million-a-year illegal marijuana trade in his country the government could take it away from drug dealers. Tension: Ms Kirchner attempted to hand Mr Cameron a package last June marked 'UN - Malvinas' but the Prime Minister refused to accept it . Tensions between Britain and Argentina have risen under Ms Kirchner's rule, with the president  continually asserting her country's claim to sovereignty over the Falkland Islands. Her ambassador to London caused anger when she dismissed a recent referendum on the islands' future - in which residents voted overwhelmingly in favour of remaining British - as a 'publicity stunt.' Last June David Cameron was involved in an . extraordinary stand-up row with Ms Kirchner over the future of the future of the islands - which are known as the Malvinas by Argentina. Ms Kirchner appeared to . attempt to thrust a package stuffed with documents about her country’s . claim to the British territory into Mr Cameron’s hands at the G20 summit . in Mexico. To her fury, the Prime Minister . refused to accept it – and insisted that she respect the views of the . islanders, who want to remain British.","Jose Mujica did not know microphone was switched on at time .

"Police in Brazil are investigating whether a 13-year-old boy thought to have murdered his police officer parents, his grandmother and his great-aunt was actually the fifth victim of a massacre carried out by criminal cops who wanted his mother dead, it was reported today. Schoolboy Marcelo Pesseghini had been named as the only suspect in the horrific family bloodbath after it appeared he shot each victim in the head early Monday morning at their home in Sao Paulo. In a tragedy which has shocked Brazil, the teenager then spent a normal full day at school, before returning home where he apparently killed himself. Scroll down for video . Murdered: 13-year-old Marcelo Pesseghini is now believed to be the victim of a cover-up in the murder of his parents Luiz and Andreia. It is believed she may have been targeted because she was a police informant . But doubt has now been cast on the . police's version of events after it was revealed Marcelo's mother, . Andreia Regina Pesseghini Bovo, 36, had been involved in turning over . criminal cops in the months leading up to her violent death. Col Wagner Dimas Pereira, commander of . the 18th Miliary Police Battalion where Ms Bovo worked, told a radio . station that the policewoman had passed on information about officers . who were allegedly stealing money from bank cash machines. He added that she had provided details . about various colleagues suspected of being part of a criminal gang . within the police force, which had led to them being removed from their . duties. And he added that he had doubts about . the involvement of Marcelo in the massacre, who has been described as a . quiet boy who loved his parents and never as much as got into a fight at . school. Col Pereira told Radio Bandeirantes: . 'She never exactly said, that one, that one and that one. But, in the . context of our investigations, she confirmed a number of details.' CCTV footage from a security camera shows Marcelo Pesseghini casually walking to school in the early hours of Monday morning . He said none of those accused had been charged with a crime because the investigation was still ongoing. But he said policemen suspected of . being involved in the robberies had been transferred to other police . departments: 'Those ones, we removed them from the picture, those who . were supposed to be part of the 'group' inside the battalion.' Col Pereira called on investigators . into the family's murder not to 'rule out' the hypothesis that Marcelo . might have been framed by criminal policemen who wanted his mother dead. He said: 'Let's not throw it out, . let's look at things carefully, lets see if there is reasoning in what . we already have, if the pieces of the puzzle really do fit together.' Police chief Itagiba Franco, in charge . of investigations into the massacre, said he would look into Col . Pereira's accusations, but insisted that they 'wouldn't alter the . direction of the investigation.' Police believe that Marcelo murdered . his family at their home in the northern Sao Paulo district of Vila . Brasilandia in an overnight massacre beginning on Sunday night and . continuing into the early hours of Monday. He then stole his mother's care and calmly drove it to school, where he waited for five hours before lessons started. After getting a lift back home at the . end of the day by the father of a schoolmate, investigators believe he . stroked his dead mother's hair before shooting himself in the head. His father, Luiz Marcelo Pesseghini . Bovo, 40, a police sergeant with 19-years service, was found in bed. His . mother Andreia, who had worked in police administration 16 years, was . found on her knees in the bedroom. His grandmother, Benedita de Oliveira . Bovo, 65, and great-aunt Bernadete Oliveira da Silva, 55, who lived in a . different section of the family's compound, were also both killed in . bed. The teenager was found dead from a gunshot to the left temple and his father's police-issue service revolver was found nearby. A second gun, a .32 caliber revolver, was found inside the backpack the teenager took to school. Killer: Marcelo Pesseghini poses with his police officer father in a Facebook photograph . Victims: Luiz Pesseghini, 40, a police sergeant with 19 years service was found dead in his bed. Andreia Pesseghini, 30, who had served in the military police for 16 years was found on her knees in the bedroom . However, a number of relatives of the Pesseghinis have voiced their doubts about Marcelo's involvement in the killings. Sebastico de Oliveira Costa, Mrs . Pesseghini's brother, said he did not believe the boy had the strength . to lift and fire the hefty .40 calibre weapon. He said: 'It makes no sense. This is a heavy gun and he couldn't have had the strength to shoot it'. And Marcelo's cousin, Sandra Alves . Feitosa, said: 'If it was a Marcelo who did it, then it was a force of . evil. He was a boy who was loving and loved by all. He never even got . into a fight at school.' Sao Paulo's police are widely regarded . as among the most corrupt in the world and in recent years officers . have been mired in numerous scandals. Death squads within the military police are widely suspected of mass killings and extra-judicial executions. In January, six military police . officers were charged with killing seven people in a bar in the Campo . Limpo district of Sao Paulo.

"Brazilian football icon Ronaldo is embarking on a new career - as a porn magnate, it was reported today. The World Cup winner is reportedly hoping to buy the huge Playboy franchise in Brazil. The former Real Madrid striker-turned-businessman, 35, is believed to be close to making a bid for the popular men's magazine. Business venture: Ronaldo is keen to buy the Brazilian Playboy franchise . His marketing firm 9INE already manages images rights to some of Brazil's biggest sports stars, including football prodigy and new Barcelona signing Neymar. Sources close to the star, real name Ronaldo Nazario de Lima, told Brazil's Extra newspaper he sees the soft-porn publication - Brazil's tenth best-selling magazine - as a lucrative business opportunity. Popular: The Brazilian branch of the franchise is the third largest in the world . Playboy in Brazil has the third largest readership of the magazine in the world, reguarly selling over 250,000 copies a month - but sales have fallen in the last decade from sometimes over a million in the 1990s. Friends of the footballer said Ronaldo - nicknamed The Phenomenon in his native country - believes his 'midas touch' will help rejuvenate the magazine. Ronaldo retired from football in 2011 after a glittering career. He scored a record 15 goals in World Cups and in 2002 won the World Cup for his country, scoring two goals in the final. Since then his shrewd investments and endorsement deals have made him a billionaire, according to estimates. He receives around £10 million a year from sponsors including Nike, Fiat and Duracell, while his company 9INE is set to make £15 million in 2014, according to a spokesman. He also owns a chain of gyms, a sports health clinic and a six-storey building which houses a Rio de Janeiro university, as well as a nightclub in Rio's most affluent neighbourhood, Leblon. And he has millions of pounds worth of real estate, including apartments in Rio, Sao Paulo, Paris and Madrid, and his own private island off the Rio de Janeiro coast. The footballer owns a series of properties in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro, including gyms, a sports health club and a nightclub .","Ronaldo is reportedly hoping to buy the Brazilian Playboy franchise .

"Eleven students from the British School in Rio de Janeiro have been injured after their bus crashed on the way back from a school trip. The pupils, aged 14 to 17, were returning from a hiking expedition for their Duke of Edinburgh gold and silver awards in Paraty, in the south of Rio de Janeiro state. But the bus overturned on Tuesday evening as it drove along a coastal road near the town of Itaguai, according to Brazil's O Globo newspaper. Trip: The pupils - all aged between 14 and 17 - attend the elite British School, pictured, in Rio de Janeiro . The students were treated in a local hospital. None of their injuries are thought to be life-threatening. The British School is one of Rio de Janeiro's most elite private schools with fees of more than £1,100 a month. Children of British parents are given priority for places but pupils of all nationalities attend the school so they can be taught the UK national curriculum.

"Virginia Helena de Souza is accused of 'playing God' and killing up to 320 patients to free up beds . A woman doctor accused of killing up to 320 patients to free up hospital beds may prove to  be the world’s most prolific serial killer. Virginia Helena de Souza, 56, may have ended the lives of more victims than Dr Harold Shipman, who murdered 215 patients over 25 years. De Souza is accused of giving patients fatal drug doses or cutting off oxygen to those on life-support machines in her ward at the Hospital Evangelico in Curitiba, south Brazil. She allegedly administered muscle relaxant drugs used to kill death row prisoners in seconds. Police believe she picked off poorer . patients who were staying for free under Brazil’s national health . system, freeing beds for patients who could pay or had private health . insurance. De Souza was arrested last month over . the premature deaths of seven terminally ill patients. An undercover . police officer recorded her saying she wanted to ‘unclutter’ the ward. But an inquiry by Brazil’s Department . of Health has increased the number of patients to 20 with around 300 . other suspicious deaths still to be investigated. Her husband, a doctor who died of intestinal cancer in 2006, is feared to have been her first victim. Doctor Mario Lobato, leading the . investigation, said de Souza  ‘played God’ by deciding which patients . should die. ‘There are 20 cases which have already been closed, and we . have nearly 300 cases still open which we are looking at,’ he said. 'In each case, the testimony of people who worked inside the hospital confirmed what we have found on the patient records. ‘All of them have the same modus operandi, the same relationship between the drug and death, and the same time between both.’ If confirmed, de Souza would surpass Britain's Harold Shipman as the world's most deadly doctor. The doctor was arrested last month over the premature deaths of seven terminally ill patients (file picture) If the Brazilian Health Ministry's fears are confirmed, De Souza would surpass British GP Harold Shipman as the world's deadliest doctor . Shipman, who hanged himself in prison aged 57, murdered at least 215 patients aged between 47 and 93 over 25 years. Dr Lobato said some of the patients were conscious and talking moments before they died. He said: 'One was awake, being nebulised but not even connected to a respirator. 'This patient had asked his family to bring his glasses so he could do some reading while he was in the intensive care ward. 'Another patient had just asked a nurse for a cup of water. 'This nurse testified that one of the things she will never forget is that she didn't manage to give him the cup of water because by the time she returned he had already died.' De Souza's lawyer, Elias Mattar Assad, said the doctor will protest her innocence. She said: 'Soon we will be able to prove that what happened in that ward can be justified in medical writings.'

"A Brazilian doctor accused of ending the lives of her hospital patients to free up hospital beds could be responsible for more than 300 deaths. Virginia Soares de Souza was arrested last month after a number of terminally ill patients were found to have died prematurely while under her watch in the Hospital Evangelico in Curitiba, south Brazil. De Souza is accused of administering fatal doses of drugs or reducing the amount of oxygen given to patients in the hospital's intensive care ward. The doctor was arrested last month over the premature deaths of seven terminally ill patients (file picture) The doctor was initially charged with involvement in the deaths of seven patients. But an inquiry by Brazil's Health Ministry has already increased that number to 20 with around 300 other suspicious deaths at the hospital still under investigation, it was revealed today. Dr Mario Lobato, leading the investigation, told Brazil's Fantastico TV programme his team had analysed patient deaths overseen by De Souza over the last seven years. He said De Souza 'played God' by deciding which patients should die in order to free up beds in the ward. He said: 'There are 20 cases which have already been closed, and we have nearly 300 cases still open which we are looking at. 'In each case, the testimony of people who worked inside the hospital confirmed what we have found on the patient records.' If confirmed, de Souza would surpass Britain's Harold Shipman as the world's most deadly doctor. Shipman, who hanged himself in prison aged 57, murdered at least 215 patients aged between 47 and 93 over 25 years. One of the deaths de Souza is accused of is that of Ivo Spiitzer, who was on a life support system and died in January this year. If the Brazilian Health Ministry's fears are confirmed, De Souza would surpass British GP Harold Shipman as the world's deadliest doctor . De Souza is accused of reducing the oxygen he was receiving from 45 per cent to the minimum level of 21 per cent, a concentration too low for anyone to survive. Records show Mr Spitzer died an hour after being given the drug Pavulon, a muscle relaxant. In the right dosage Pavulon can be used to allow life support machine to control the patient's respiration, but can also be fatal. It is also one of the drugs administered during most lethal injections. According to Dr Lobato, the reduction of oxygen and the administering of Pavulon was the cause of most of the other suspicious deaths which occured during De Souza's watch. He said: 'All of them have the same modus operando, the same relationship between the drug and death, and the same time between both.' He said some of the patients were conscious and talking moments before they died. He said: 'One was awake, being nebulised but not even connected to a respirator. 'This patient had asked his family to bring his glasses so he could do some reading while he was in the intensive care ward. 'Another patient had just asked a nurse for a cup of water. 'This nurse testified that one of the things she will never forget is that she didn't manage to give him the cup of water because by the time she returned he had already died.' De Souza's lawyer, Elias Mattar Assad, said the doctor will protest her innocence. She said: 'Soon we will be able to prove that what happened in that ward can be justified in medical writings.' Another three doctors and a nurse have also been arrested accused of collaborating with De Souza. All those accused have been freed on bail while the inquiry continues.

"David de Gea has admitted he wants Cristiano Ronaldo to return to Manchester United but concedes any deal would be difficult to complete. The Real Madrid forward left Old Trafford in 2009 for Spain but has revealed he would be open for a return to the Theatre of Dreams in the future. Goalkeeper De Gea has become a key player for the Red Devils and would welcome the addition of the World Player of the Year to the United side. Cristiano Ronaldo trains with Portugal ahead of a friendly with France and a Euro 2016 qualifier with Denmark . David de Gea admits he wants Ronaldo to return to Manchester United from Real Madrid . 'Of course I would like Cristiano Ronaldo to come to Manchester United,' De Gea told Goal.com, 'but I think it's difficult.' United have already bolstered their team heavily during the summer with the £60million capture of Angel di Maria from Madrid, with Radamel Falcao also joining from Monaco. The duo's impressive form since arriving at Old Trafford has drawn praise from De Gea who claims the pair have already adapted to the Premier League. Ronaldo's spell at Real Madrid has seen him win the Champions League and been named Ballon D'or winner . Ronaldo also won the Champions League at United in 2008 and has stated a desire to return to Old Trafford . 'They have adapted quickly, both scoring and supplying assists,' De Gea added. 'They will make us better as everybody knows how well they did in Spain [with Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid respectively] I hope they score a lot of goals for Manchester United.' De Gea also admitted to producing one of his best United performances in the 2-1 win over Everton last Sunday. The Spaniard saved a penalty from Leighton Baines and produced a string of superb saves to keep the Toffees at bay. 'It gives you a lot of confidence,' De Gea continued. 'It was an important victory for the team and I will always remember it. It was one of the best [performances] I've had and most importantly because it ended in victory. 'There are days when you play a great game but end up not winning. So in that sense, it was a perfect match.'","David de Gea concedes any deal for Cristiano Ronaldo would be difficult .

"Martin Samuel's attack on the Champions League seeding system . UEFA have confirmed a revamp to their seeding allocation for the Champions League. From the 2015-16 campaign, the champions from the top seven leagues in Europe will feature as top seeds along with the holders of the competition. Sportsmail's Chief Sports Writer Martin Samuel attacked the current seeding system, highlighting the absurdity of Arsenal, who finished fourth in the Premier League last season, being in Pot 1 while title winners Manchester City were in Pot 2. Manchester City would be top seeds in the Champions League if they retain their Premier League title . But for Arsenal, the new rules leave them on the cusp of losing their top seed place in the Champions League having not won the Premier League title in over 10 years . Were the new rules in play this season, here's how Pot 1 would have looked: . 1 Spain - Atletico . 2 England - Manchester City . 3 Germany - Bayern Munich . 4 Portugal - Benfica . 5 Italy - Juventus . 6 Russia - CSKA Moscow . 7 France - PSG . 8 Holders - Real Madrid . But Sky Sports News has revealed that talks  took place earlier this year and the plans over seeding - which are the same as Samuel outlined in Sportsmail - were approved by the club competition committee in May. UEFA president Michel Platini hopes the rules would stop domestic champions in the major European leagues being ranked lower than other clubs from their nations. It would also prevent situations like in this season's Group A where the champions of Italy (Juventus), Spain (Atletico Madrid), Holland (Ajax) and Sweden (Malmo) are all in together. The system currently works on the co-efficient system, where clubs' previous Champions League performances and the ranking of their domestic league is taken into account.

The latest seeding rules will come as bad news for the likes of Arsenal and Manchester United, should they qualify for the Champions League but not win the Barclays Premier League or, in Arsenal’s case, not land the biggest prize in European football this season. Both clubs have previously enjoyed top-seed status due to their high UEFA coefficient.

"The son of American evangelist Benny Hinn was arrested in Brazil after allegedly beating up a deaf and dumb man during one of his father's rallies, it was reported today. Hestephenson Araujo, 21, reportedly needed hospital treatment after the incident on Saturday night during a religious crusade in Manaus, northern Brazil. Police detained Joshua Hinn, 21, along with two of Benny Hinn's bodyguards, on suspicion of torture after the three men allegedly locked Mr Araujo in a trailer and physically assaulted him. Big money miracle worker: Televangelist Benny Hinn is best known for traveling the world on 'Miracle Crusades', performing for thousands of believers, claiming he can heal the sick. He is worth some £27 million . According to police, Mr Araujo, a local pastor, was sitting in the front row of seats at the event, in the city's Povos da Amazonia arena when, during Mr Hinn's sermon, he got up and approached the stage. Mr Araujo, who was carrying a bottle of water, later said he only wanted to receive a blessing from the famous evangelist, who claims he can heal the sick. But he was allegedly pounced on by Mr Hinn's son Joshua and two bodyguards, Caleb Shirk, 26, and Konstantins Konstantinovs, 34, who claimed they thought he was about to throw water at the preacher, who is worth an estimated £27 million ($42 million). The men took Mr Araujo to a trailer parked near the stage where they allegedly held him captive inside, beating and punching him as they demanded to know who he was. Mixed blessing: Mr Hinn was performing in the Brazilian city of Manaus, Hestephenson Araujo, 21, approached the stage carrying a bottle of water, later claiming he only wanted a blessing from the famous evangelist .

"Abasteceme - which translates as 'Supply Me' - is a free Android loo paper-finding app for Venezuelans . Thousands of desperate Venezuelans have downloaded a smartphone app which helps them to find toilet paper. Loo roll has been in short supply in the South American country in recent months, with economists blaming price controls imposed by the government. The new programme, launched last week, uses crowdsourcing technology - based on Google Maps and geolocation - to enable users to let each other know which supermarkets still have stocks of the tissue. Called Abasteceme - which translates as 'Supply Me' - the free Android app has already been downloaded more than 12,000 times. Creator Jose Augusto Montiel said most downloads have been made by residents from the capital Caracas. The 21-year-old chemical engineering student said: 'Lots of things are in short supply, but what people are most worried about is finding toilet paper. 'People never knew how much they needed it until it started running out.' Loo roll has been in short supply in the South American country in recent months, with economists blaming price controls imposed by the government . Venezuelan . president Nicolas Maduro claims anti-government forces are deliberately . buying up basics like toilet paper to destabilise the country. He recently promised to import 50million extra rolls to boost supplies. Other basic items in short supply across the country include wheat flour, soap and butter. 'From what I've seen so far, it's mostly toilet paper, followed by flour,' Montiel said about what gets posted most. He . said most of Abasteceme's users were in Caracas when he first made the . app available on the Google Play website on May 29 - but it has now . spread all over the nation. The app's creator Jose Augusto Montiel said most downloads have been made by residents from the capital Caracas . Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro recently promised to import 50million extra rolls to boost supplies . Montiel said he has no help beyond his sister, who assists with the programme's aesthetics. 'I'm also working to develop it for the BlackBerry as a lot of people have them in Venezuela,' he added. Commerce Minister Alejandro Fleming blamed the shortage of toilet tissue on 'excessive demand' built up as a result of 'a media campaign that has been generated to disrupt the country'. 'The revolution will bring the country the equivalent of 50million rolls of toilet paper,' he said last month. 'We are going to saturate the market so that our people calm down.' Finance Minister Nelson Merentes said the government was also addressing the lack of foreign currency, which has resulted in the suspension of foreign supplies of raw materials, equipment and spare parts to Venezuelan companies, disrupting their production. 'We are making progress ... we have to work very hard,' he said. Fleming said monthly consumption of toilet paper was normally 125million rolls, but that current demand 'leads us to think that 40 million more are required.'","Free Android app Abasteceme ('Supply Me') downloaded over 12,000 times .

He said he saw 'a lot of desperate people' running for the closest door ""which was that of the bathroom, and they hid inside. I saw people who worked at the club even hiding inside the freezers. 'When I saw there were no way I could get out of the main entrance, I went round through the VIP area and out the side, pushing and stepping over a lot of people. I was stepping on the bodies of women and men who had fallen down or passed out. 'I didn't hear any fire alarm sounding, only screams. I didn't see any emergency exit signs lit up, just smoke. 'When I got out, my mind was full of the people that I'd stepped over to get out and I went back to take them out because I couldn't stand to hear their screams, or see the police and firefighters unable to get them out because there were so many people piled up on top of each other.' Ezequiel said that after a hole had been opened in the wall he climbed back inside to help a firefighter save more people. He wrote: 'I went in and for the first time saw death personally. 'The first time I turned on the torch and focused on the VIP area, I saw many bodies, I didn't know what to do any more, I lost strength because I could see people hanging from the railings, I saw people piled up on top of each other, and it wasn't one or two dozen, it was a lot of people.

Police chief Sandro Meinerz said the club's co-owner Elissandro Sphor, who was in the club at the time of the tragedy, denies taking the equipment.

Maria. Such organised university parties are common throughout Brazil. Some reports claimed desperate revellers had mistaken the toilet signs for those for the emergency exit.

'Attilio Lombardo is new assistant coach alongside Sven Pretty,' Di Matteo said. 'He brings a wealth of international experience as a player and as a coach. 'For the goalkeeper training Massimo Battara will be responsible. He also has a lot of experience in different leagues, as Lombardo was active in Italy and England.

'At Chelsea I worked with Ruud Gullit. From him I learned the Dutch mentality. I think you take from each coach, under which you have played something with. 'I have watched intensely the performances of Schalke. We have a good team, a team with a lot of potential going forward.

The defence, and by that I mean not just the back four must be stable. 'It is important that the balance between defensive and offensive is right. Individually, each player must make a contribution so that the team is successful. The team as a whole one. My goal is to get from each player the maximum.

Back then, Spurs were a cup team – a very good one at that. But while the game has moved on, Tottenham’s trophy cabinet really hasn’t kept up. In the previous 24 years to the Wembley win over Nottingham Forest, Spurs won three FA Cups, two UEFA Cups as well as two league cups. Since defeating Brian Clough’s side, it’s been just the two league cups added to the White Hart Lane trophy cabinet. Sadly for Spurs fans, it’s not because overall league form has improved in the form of consistent title challenges. Since 1991, Tottenham have never finished higher than fourth. In the previous 24 years they did it five times. Their proud cup record has too faded in that time with Manchester United and arch rivals Arsenal both now having won the FA Cup 11 times. Spurs captain Gary Mabbutt holds the FA Cup aloft after beating Nottingham Forest in the 1991 final . This is not to say Spurs are an underachieving club. In the financial and stadium stakes, there are at least five teams bigger in the Premier League. For the club to have reached the top four twice in the last five years while being among the lowest net spenders in the division shows just how competitive they have been. The 2010/11 Champions League season will fondly be remembered for Gareth Bale’s hat-trick at Inter Milan, Peter Crouch’s winner at AC Milan and nights where the club went toe-to-toe with Real Madrid in a quarter-final. Except the last one on that list didn’t end too happily, because that’s where their Champions League dream came to a rather humiliating end in a 5-0 aggregate defeat. Gareth Bale scores one of his three goals against Inter Milan in the UEFA Champions League in October 2010 . Here is Tottenham’s problem. They are now happy to make up the numbers and go on reasonable cup runs before letting elite teams grab success. In cup terms, these top sides should be dreading Spurs. Arguably the Premier League aside, they are good enough to win any other competition they enter. Portsmouth and Wigan are just a couple of recent teams who prove you don’t need the best squad to taste glory. In fact, a quick glance at this season’s Europa League makes them the bookies’ favourites to win the competition. Unusual considering the club haven’t stepped foot in a European semi-final since winning the competition 30 years ago. Even Middlesbrough and Fulham have reached the final in the last decade. Fans can often be split on whether they would rather reach the Premier League top four or win the Europa League, but with the Europa League now the gateway to the Champions League for the first time this season, there’s no reason why Tottenham can’t have their cake and eat it. Tottenham Hotspur prepare for Thursday night's UEFA Europa League clash at the Partizan Stadium . Spurs have a no worse chance of winning the Europa League than they do of reaching the top four – and the advantage of the former is a famous cup win in addition to gate-crashing Europe’s elite. The new rule in place for this season onwards was made for clubs like Tottenham. It’s the perfect carrot to dangle for the north London side – especially if their domestic form stutters. The road to the final in Warsaw may seem a long one, compared to short trips around England (and the odd visit to Wales) in the top flight, but it could be a more memorable one. Partizan Belgrade and Besiktas will provide fair competition in a group also featuring Astears, but it admittedly would be a surprise should the north London side fail to progress. Not noted however, especially in early less glamorous ties of the competition, is just how tough the tournament is to win. Stambouli stretches during a training session at the Partizan Stadium on Wednesday night . Already in this year’s Europa League are Fiorentina, Napoli, Inter Milan and holders Sevilla who wouldn’t look out of place on a Champions League night. With group stage drop-outs from UEFA’s premier competition to enter the knockout round of the last 32, the tournament’s strength suddenly stands out. But this shouldn’t be a reason why Spurs should put the competition on the back-burner. On the contrary, it should be a reason to embrace it. Steve Archibald celebrates with the trophy after Tottenham Hotspur won the UEFA Cup in 1984 . Tottenham’s UEFA Cup wins in 1972 and 1984 are among the club’s most memorable nights, but with such few European memories since then, it’s time for Spurs to prove to the continent they are capable of bringing the ‘glory, glory nights’ back to White Hart Lane – as well as a cup win. When Tottenham kick-off at Partizan Belgrade at 6pm on Thursday, supporters should be watching ITV4 believing that for the first time in a long time, Spurs are in it to win it. After all, it was 1961 double winning captain Danny Blanchflower who proclaimed ‘the game is about glory’.

"Cristiano Ronaldo found himself upstaged by Real Madrid team-mate Karim Benzema and former Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba on Saturday night as France beat Portugal 2-1 in their international friendly. Ronaldo, sitting on the bench with an ice pack on his left knee after being substituted on 76 minutes, could do little to turn Portugal's fortunes around at the Stade de France after the hosts took a third-minute lead through Benzema. Portugal substitute Ricardo Quaresma set up a tense finale by slotting home a penalty for the visitors, but France held on to their slender advantage. Click here for the full match report . Host commentator . Portugal lose another game (and possibly Ronaldo too through injury), Poland stun Germany to win in Warsaw, while Northern Ireland go top of Group F! I'll leave you with the results of tonight's qualifiers but make sure you check back tomorrow for live coverage of Estonia vs England. I'll see you then. Cheerio. With games ticking over into injury time, the camera flicks to Ronaldo on the Portugal bench who seems to have an ice pack on his knee. One to watch... I thought there was a goal coming but not from Poland! Moments after Bellarabi blasts over the bar for Germany, Lewandowski fends off pressure inside the Germany box before squaring for Sebastian Mila to tuck home into the bottom corner. The celebrations are wild with Poland on the cusp of beating Germany for the first time. How on earth have Germany not equalised?! Bellarabi sees a stinging 16-yard shot beaten away by Szczesny, while Lukas Podolski has just crahesd a rocket of a volley off the crossbar with his Arsenal team-mate well beaten between the Poland sticks. Logic, eh. Sometimes it doesn't quite work. The world's best player in Ronaldo departs and his replacement Joao Mario wins an instant penalty after being tripped by Pogba, which Danny dispatches past Mandanda. We've hardly seen anything from Ronaldo tonight but he goes close to pulling a goal back. A powerful shot across goal was heading for the corner until Raphael varane blocked the ball behind. Ronaldo has since departed to be replaced by Joao Maria. Portugal have looked close to hopeless at times and should be 3-0 down. Blaise Matuidi skips past a sliding tackle as he advances on goal, only to place his one-on-one shot across goal wide. Slapstick defending from Portugal, it really is. Patrice Evra somehow skips past two defenders on the byline before cutting the ball back for Benzema. The striker then lays the ball off for Paul Pogba to tuck home low into the bottom corner. That should be that in Paris. Even though there are just over 20 minutes left, the more of this game I watch the more convinced I am that Germany will grab an equaliser. They have opportunities and one has just passed by as bellarabi pokes straight at the keeper after running on to a pass. Northern Ireland continue to press for a third goal and only poor finishing denies them. Niall McGinn does the hard work by bringing the ball into the box after cutting inside from the right, but Connor McLaughlin then steals in to scuff a first time shot wide across goal. He looks frustrated with himself and so he should be. Half-chance for Portugal but Eliseu's cross towards the near post is claimed by Steve Mandanda in front of the sliding Nani. Brilliant save from Szczesny! Andre Schurrle arcs his body to bend a shot towards the bottom corner, but the Arsenal keeper leaps to his right to beat the ball away. At the other end Lewandowski leaves a sneaky foot in while challenging Bayern Munich team-mate and keeper Manuel Neuer and unsurprisingly picks up a booking. Against the run of play? probably. Does it bring this game to life? Definitely! Warsaw erupts as Germany fail to deal with a diagonal ball, before Lukasz Piszczek recycles the ball by lofting a cross into the box where Arkadiusz Milik heads home. A Germany onslaught in 3, 2, 1... A very pedestrian opening to the second half. Portugal have much of the ball but my word, their passing tempo is almost at walking pace. France could defend this until the cows come home whether it's against Ronaldo or not. Before the start of the half, Cristiano Ronaldo was the only player standing in the tunnel for the visitors - looking ahead in deep concentration as team-mates trailed far behind. I wonder if the skipper had a strong word or two at the break? Having beat Portugal, Albania are on course for another shock as they lead Denmark. Speaking of Portugal, they have been second best in France as they trail the Euro 2016 hosts 1-0 in Paris. The half-time whistle came at the right time for Poland with Germany just starting to up the pressure in Warsaw, while Greece and Northern Ireland will certainly be pleased with their work in the first 45. Click here for more fixtures and results with Sportsmail's excellent Match Zone . On the cusp of half-time, the hosts nearly extend their lead further as Oliver Norwood's swerving shot from 25 yards forces Nielsen into a rather unconvincing punch over his bar. Meanwhile in Paris, it's really not Ronaldo's night. The Real Madrid forward attempts about three-to-four stepovers before eventually wasting possession. Manchester City defender Eliaquim Managala has been booked for a foul on Danny. Two super chances for Germany to open the scoring. First Karim Bellarabi squeezes a shot narrowly wide across goal from a Mario Gotze cross, before Thomas Muller sees a shot deflected wide after pouncing on to a through ball on the counter attack. Germany are going through the gears. It's a harsh spot-kick awarded as Ferguson is booked for tugging down Joan Edmundsson, but from the penalty Frodi Benjaminsen sees his shot pushed on to the post by Roy Carroll before the hosts scramble clear. Justice is served. It's yet to really get going in Warsaw, but Germany have done well to keep the home crowd relatively quiet so far. The visitors win a corner which results in Jerome Boateng's long range drive deflecting into the path of Thomas Muller, whose outstretched volley across the target is well saved by Wojciech Szczesny. Encouraging applause from Fernando Santos on the Portugal bench, as Andre Gomes turns well on the edge of the box before scooping a shot over the bar. And it really should be three as Lafferty peels off his marker to head a cross towards the bottom corner, only for Gunnar Nielsen to dive down low and parry behind. I had concerns that Northern Ireland would slip up tonight, but they are in complete control at Windsor Park! A lovely near post cross is chipped in by Shane Ferguson, where Kyle Lafferty is on hand to divert a finish home with a cute touch. Poland have never beaten Germany but they are giving the world champions a fair contest so far. The hosts even want a penalty as Robert Lewandowski goes down under pressure from a defender in the box, but that would have been very soft had it been awarded. No response from Portugal yet as Rui Patricio again has to be alrt to deny Antonie Griezmann. A very quite start from Cristiano Ronaldo so far. Fast starts are in the air this evening as Northern Ireland also race ahead with Gareth McAuley putting the home side in front. Maybe things have to get worse before they get better for Portugal! In just the third minute, France lead! Bacary Sagna's low shot across goal from a low cross is well saved by Rui Patricio diving low, but first to the rebound is Karim Benzema to tap home. Portugal, playing in white, get the action going in the Stade de France . And what a contrast in scenes. To the relative few inside a Windsor Park under redevelopment to the packed National Stadium in Warsaw where Poland are hosting the world champions in Germany. Shane Ferguson is handed his first competitive football of the season as Northern Ireland make two changes for their Euro 2016 clash against the Faroe Islands. Ferguson, yet to kick a ball for Newcastle this term, replaces the injured Chris Brunt from the side which defeated Hungary last month, while Niall McGinn is promoted from the bench having scored in that match.

"England boss Roy Hodgson has suggested there's more to come from England after a bright showing that saw his side win 2-0 in Switzerland. In what was billed as the Three Lions' toughest Euro 2016 qualifier, Hodgson's team recorded a morale boosting victory at St. Jakob-Park in Basle thanks to two Danny Welbeck goals. The England manager was pleased with his side's overall display but admitted there were areas for improvements and that his young squad needed to work on cutting naivety out of their game. Job done: England boss Roy Hodgson celebrates during his side's 2-0 win in Switzerland . I've never really lost faith. I'm just pleased to see the boys play well, Hodgson told ITV after the game. 'I thought that the way we approached the game from the first minute was exactly what we wanted and we got our reward for once. 'I think we made hard work of it because there were so many chances to score goals before we eventually got the one that we needed but it was a good performance away from home against one of the better teams in the group and I'm pleased we won. 'I thought they played some good football in the second half. I thought in the first half we were largely in control but they got better as the game went on but luckily we didn't deteriorate too much. 'I think there are areas there that we've got to improve. But you can't expect players playing their early games, or even making their debuts, to make all the right decisions and not show some naivety from time to time because of the pressures of the game. They are areas we can work (on) and we've got a couple of years to do so.' Hotshot: Danny Welbeck scored twice for the Three Lions in the Euro 2016 qualifier . England created a fair amount of chances to make the margin of victory more comfortable, but also had to survive a few scares with Joe Hart making a number of superb stops while Gary Cahill made a crucial goal line clearance in the second half with the score at 1-0. But following a poor World Cup and an uninspiring 1-0 friendly win over Norway on Wednesday, the Group E triumph will lift the pressure on the national side. Former England manager Glenn Hoddle shared Hodgson's sentiments that the squad still had areas to improve, but admitted that the talent exists in the squad to develop into a fine international side that will find its strength on the counter attack. Talking point: Former England boss Glenn Hoddle (right) was an ITV pundit for the game in Basle alongside former England internationals Lee Dixon (left) and Ian Wright . 'There's quite a lot of players that are not international footballers yet, but in two years’ time they can embrace this,' Hoddle told ITV post match. 'They will make mistakes but we've got youth and talent that's not even in the team at the moment. 'You've got to draw the line and move on from the World Cup, we are going to qualify and I think we can progress as a team going forward. 'We deserved it and defended reasonably well. This team needs to be 1-0 up, it's made for counter attacking football - we've got pace with this team. We saw a much more confident team.'","Roy Hodgson pleased with England side following 2-0 win in Switzerland .

"Sheffield United continued to pay Ched Evans after he was convicted of rape. Football clubs can terminate a player’s contract, sacking them on the grounds of gross misconduct if they are found guilty of a criminal offence. But Sportsmail understands that officials at Bramall Lane honoured the remaining few months of Evans’ £20,000-per-week contract after he was imprisoned in April 2012 for raping a 19-year-old girl. Sheffield United continued to pay Ched Evans after he was convicted of rape . Evans was jailed in 2012, but the Blades honoured the remaining months of his contract at Bramall Lane . Evans’ contract ran out at the end of June that year and the club announced he had been released with a number of other players that summer. But the Welsh international forward actually received his July salary too; something that a club is contractually obliged to do when releasing a player who has not, at that stage, found another club. When asked on Thursday night why Sheffield United did not immediately respond to his rape conviction by sacking Evans, a spokesman for the League One club refused to comment. Blades boss Nigel Clough says it is up to his employers to decide whether Evans can return to the club . But the stance the club took over their former striker perhaps gives the best indication yet that they are prepared to welcome him back to Bramall Lane once he is released, as expected, from jail on Friday. Publicly the club have not revealed their position on the future of Evans, insisting they have not yet made a decision. Earlier this week manager Nigel Clough said it was up to his employers to decide. It is a situation that continues to divide opinion. While Professional Footballers’ Association chief executive Gordon Taylor insists Evans, now 25, should be allowed to return to work, Sheffield United came under yet more pressure to reject Evans on Thursday when deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, joined the debate. PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor insists Evans should be allowed to return after serving his time . In an interview with LBC Radio Mr Clegg, who is a Sheffield MP, said: ‘I think the owners need to think really long and hard about the fact that when you take a footballer on, you are not taking just a footballer these days, you are also taking on a role model. ‘You are taking on a role model, particularly for a lot of young boys who look up to their heroes on a football pitch in a team like that, and he has committed a very serious crime. ‘It is for the football club to decide, but I really do think that footballers these days, they are major public figures who have a public responsibility to set an example for other people. Deputy prime minister Nick Clegg has questioned whether Evans should have a future in the game . Evans was a full Wales international before he got put behind bars . ‘I’m sure that will weigh heavily in the decisions made by the owners of Sheffield United. Rape is an incredibly serious offence, an unbelievably serious offence. 'He has done his time but I just don’t believe that the owners of a football club can somehow wish away the fact that that has happened.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","League One club continued to pay Evans after he was convicted in 2012 .

"If Tottenham go on to lift the Europa League trophy next May, very few will remember their opening group stage encounter at Partizan Belgrade. Spurs hustled a goalless draw in Serbia but while it was without major incident on the pitch, the stalemate showed a rather unfamiliar robust performance from the north London outfit – one they will likely have to give again on the road to Warsaw. Attacking has never been a major problem for a Spurs side on a consistent basis, but having the personnel in defence to soak up pressure under a hostile crowd has been found wanting all too often. The recipe was there for disaster in the group stage opener. Tottenham debutant Federico Fazio (left) and his centre half partner Jan Vertonghen were rocks at the back . A brand new defensive partnership in Federico Fazio and Jan Vertonghen, 10 changes and key players being left at home were among the reasons why the 150 Spurs fans which made the journey could have been left fearing the worst when the line-ups were announced. By contrast, the other more audible 90 per cent of the Partizan Stadium were buoyed at hearing the full team confirmations come through the PA system and the prospect of facing an under strength opposition. An interesting Serbian heavy metal take on Rod Stewart’s ‘Sailing’ (twice) had already whipped the home crowd into a frenzy in the build up to the game, and the Tottenham players soon knew about it before a ball had even been kicked. Whether it was playing a pass during the game, or strolling on to take part in the pre-match warm up, Spurs were booed, whistled and jeered heavily throughout the night to almost deafening levels. Regardless of the quality of the opposition Tottenham were up against, they were never going to stroll to an easy three points in this environment. Maybe they could have had a go, and by have a go, I mean record a shot on target. But for all of Partizan’s overall control of the game – the home side very rarely gave Hugo Lloris any tests to deal with in the Spurs goal. Hugo Lloris and Vertonghen shake on it after a job well done against Partizan Belgrade in Serbia . There were moments where Tottenham nearly shot themselves in the foot. Debutant Fazio impressed but misjudged a first-half header to hand the hosts a chance, while a counter attack near the end of the opening 45 minutes brought a good save from Lloris diving to his far post. But the combination of Fazio and Vertonghen at centre back had the majority of threats covered throughout the encounter, and gave fans genuine hope they can form a stable partnership at the back in the near future. A point away from home at Partizan is a positive result for Spurs. Manager Mauricio Pochettino admitted post-match he picked a side to win, and even my Red Star Belgrade-supporting taxi driver ahead of the match was confident Tottenham would triumph 3-1 (which if anything rather confirmed my suspicions he just hated Partizan – which with a thumbs up and a smile, he acknowledged when I put it to him). Benjamin Stambouli (right), also gave an assured display in difficult circumstances in Belgrade . Much like the Premier League cliche of teams needing to perform on a wet Tuesday night in Stoke to show their worth, in Europe Spurs must be able to grind out results when factors outside their control mean they cannot play their natural high pressing game on playing surfaces smother than a billiard table. Regardless of the changes made to the squad, Spurs will still be hoping to lift the Europa League trophy more than any other cup competition this term – with the additional prize of Champions League football going to the winner. Drawing 0-0 isn’t going to make Europe step up and take note. But while Tottenham have always had a Plan A in trying to outscore the other team, this particular stalemate shows that a more defensive Plan B could be just what Spurs need in their locker to go all the way in this competition. Mauricio Pochettino insisted he picked a Spurs side to win the match but settled for the hard-fought draw .

"Wales manager Chris Coleman has admitted that he will talk to Ched Evans before deciding whether to pick him for Wales again. Evans has been in prison since his conviction for rape in April 2012, but hopes to return to professional football on his release. A petition asking his club Sheffield United not to allow him back in their squad has been signed by more than 65,000 people, but Coleman says that, if the Football Association of Wales allow it, he would talk to the player about a return. Ched Evans has won 13 caps for Wales but has not played professionally since his conviction . Chris Coleman is keeping his options open and says he will talk to the FAW before meeting the player . 'He was found guilty of a horrible crime and it has put me in a horrible position, too,' Coleman told the Daily Star Sunday. 'I am aware of this online petition against him returning to football. 'But I am also aware that if he were say a plumber, or a carpenter, and you come out of jail, you are permitted to get back to your career. Because of the high profile nature of the sport, football is so different. 'That is why I will need to sit down and talk with the Football Association of Wales first before this could happen. Then I would also need to sit down and talk with Ched.' Evans was found guilty of rape in 2012 and is currently serving a five-year prison sentence . Former Wales manager Terry Yorath also said that he would pick the striker once he is released from prison if the FAW allowed it. 'Probably at the back of my mind I would be thinking we need a Ched Evans in the side so I’m going to go in that committee and say ""Listen we could do with him in the squad.""'
