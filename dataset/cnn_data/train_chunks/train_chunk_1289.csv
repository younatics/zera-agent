"U.S. President Barack Obama today vowed to expand U.S. influence in the Asia-Pacific region - as he battles to contain the rising economic and military might of China. He promised to 'project power and deter threats to peace' in that part of the world, hours after he announced he would be permanently stationing military aircraft and up to 2,500 Marines in northern Australia. News of the training hub 'to help allies and protect American interests across Asia' comes despite a reduction in defence spending and the winding down of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Promise: U.S. President Barack Obama today vowed to expand U.S. influence in the Asia-Pacific region - as he battles to contain the rising economic and military might of China . Shaking: Obama greeted Australian troops during a visit to the Royal Army Air Force Base in Darwin . He said in a speech to the Australian Parliament: 'The United States is a Pacific power, and we are here to stay'. He declared the U.S. was not afraid of China, by far the biggest and most powerful country in the region. China immediately questioned the U.S. move and said it deserved further scrutiny. Emphasising that a U.S. presence in the Asia-Pacific region is a top priority of his administration, Obama stressed that any reductions in U.S. defence spending will not come at the expense of that goal. He said: 'Let there be no doubt: in the Asia Pacific in the 21st century, the United States of America is all in.' Promises: U.S. President Barack Obama (left)  spoke to U.S. Marines and Australian troops at the RAAF Base in Darwin, alongside Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard . Vow: U.S. President Barack Obama said he will expand U.S. influence in the Asia-Pacific region . Declaration: Obama said the U.S. was not afraid of China, by far the biggest and most powerful country in the region . From Canberra, Obama flew to the northern city of Darwin, where some of the U.S. Marines bound for Australia will be based. He visited a military base and spoke to U.S. and Australian troops. With military bases and tens of thousands of troops in Japan and South Korea, the U.S. has maintained a significant military presence in Asia for decades. Australia lies about 5,500 miles south of China, and its northern shores would give the U.S. easier access to the South China Sea, a vital commercial route. The plan outlined by Obama will allow the U.S to keep a sustained force on Australian bases and position equipment and supplies there. It will give the U.S. ability to train with allies in the region and respond more quickly to humanitarian or other crises. U.S. officials said the pact was not an attempt to create a permanent American military presence in Australia. About 250 U.S. Marines will begin a rotation in northern Australia starting next year, with a full force of 2,500 military personnel staffing up over the next several years. The U.S. will bear the cost of the deployment and the troops will be shifted from other deployments around the world. Obama's visit marked the first time a sitting U.S. president has been to Darwin, where U.S. and Australian forces were killed in a Japanese attack during World War II. The president then laid a wreath at a memorial for the USS Peary, a Navy destroyer that was sunk during that battle. For Obama, Asia represents both a security challenge and an economic opportunity. Speaking in broad geopolitical terms, the president asserted: 'With most of the world's nuclear powers and some half of humanity, Asia will largely define whether the century ahead will be marked by conflict or cooperation, needless suffering or human progress.' Commentators said that virtually everything Obama is doing on his nine-day trip across the Asia-Pacific region has a Chinese subtext, underscoring a relationship that is at once cooperative and marked by tensions over currency, human rights and military might. China's military spending has increased threefold since the 1990s to about $160 billion last year, and its military recently tested a new stealth jet fighter and launched its first aircraft carrier. A congressional advisory panel yesterday urged the White House and Congress to look more closely at China's military expansion. And it pressed for a tougher stance against what it called anti-competitive Chinese trade policies. The expanded basing agreement with Australia is just one of several initiatives Obama has taken that is likely to set Beijing on edge at a tricky time. The U.S. is China's second largest trading partner, and the economies are deeply intertwined. Respects: Obama and Gillard laid wreaths at the USS Peary Memorial today . Addressing: U.S. President Barack Obama made his comments on security in the region to the Australian Parliament in Canberra earlier today . Chinese leaders do not want the economy disrupted when global growth is shaky and they are preparing to transfer power to a new leadership next year. Darwin, where the U.S. Marines will be based, was yesterday dubbed the 'Pearl Harbour of Australia' by its Prime Minister Julia Gillard. More bombs were dropped on Darwin during a surprise Japanese raid during World War II than on Pearl Harbour, in Hawaii, where 2,395 were killed. The Pearl Harbour nickname will sit uncomfortably with many Australians, who fear the stationing of U.S. troops could make them a target for terrorists. Over the weekend, while playing host to Chinese President Hu Jintao and other Pacific rim leaders at a summit in Hawaii, Obama said the U.S. would join a new regional free trade group that so far has excluded China. That added an economic dimension to what some Chinese commentators have called a new U.S. containment policy that features reinvigorated defense ties with nations along China's perimeter, from traditional allies Japan and the Philippines to former enemy Vietnam, all of whom are anxious about growing Chinese power. China was immediately leery of the prospect of an expanded U.S. military presence in Australia. Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Weimin said there should be discussion as to whether the plan was in line with the common interests of the international community. Tribute: One of Obama's first engagements of today was to visit the Australian War Memorial in Canberra . Respects: Obama laid a wreath at the Australian War Memorial (left) before signing its Book of Remembrance . Historic: Obama (centre) walked along the Roll of Honour with Australian PM Julia Gillard (right) and Chairman of the Australian War Memorial Peter Cosgrove (left) Responding to questions at a news conference yesterday with Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard, Obama sought to downplay tension between the world powers. He said: 'The notion that we fear China is mistaken.' Capital city of Northern Territory . Population of 127,500 . Least populous of all Australia's capital cities . Proximity to Asia makes it important gateway . Enjoys a tropical climate, with a wet and a dry season . Had to be rebuilt after Japanese air raids during World War II . City was also devastated by Cyclone Tracy in 1974 . Obama avoided a confrontational tone with China in his speech to the Australian parliament, praising Beijing as a partner in reducing tensions on the Korean Peninsula and preventing proliferation. He said: 'We'll seek more opportunities for cooperation with Beijing, including greater communication between our militaries to promote understanding and avoid miscalculation.' In a note of caution, however, he added: 'We will do this, even as continue to speak candidly with Beijing about the importance of upholding international norms and respecting the universal human rights of the Chinese people.' Having ruled out military reductions in Asia and the Pacific, the Obama administration has three main areas where it could cut troop strength: Europe, the Middle East and the U.S. All U.S. troops are being withdrawn from Iraq by the end of this year, and a draw down in Afghanistan is under way. But the Pentagon has said recently that the U.S. will maintain a major presence in the greater Middle East as a hedge against Iranian aggression and influence. New home: Darwin is the capital city of the Northern Territory with a population of 127,500 . A more likely area for troop reductions is Europe, although no decisions have been announced. The debate over defence budgets is just one aspect of a broader political fight over fixing the nation's debt problem during a presidential election season. Already, the Pentagon is facing $450 billion in cuts over ten years, as part of a budget deal approved last summer. And if a special congressional committee can't agree on $1.2 trillion in more long-term cuts or Congress rejects its plan, then cuts of $1.2 trillion kick in, with half coming from defence. Arrival: U.S. President Barack Obama is now in the Indonesian island of Bali for the East Asia Summit . Australia's Prime Minister Julia Gillard said: 'We are a region that is growing economically. But stability is important for economic growth, too.' She said that 'our alliance has been a bedrock of stability in our region'. Obama's visit is intended to show the tightness of that relationship and he hailed the long ties between the United States and Australia, two nations far away that have spilled blood together . He said: 'From the trenches of the First World War to the mountains of Afghanistan-Aussies and Americans have stood together, fought together and given their lives together in every single major conflict of the past hundred years. Every single one.' Located: The U.S. has military bases around the world, as depicted in this graphic .","President vows to contain the rising economic and military might of China .

"Mark Zuckerberg admitted it, and a new study has proved it: Facebook is no longer cool with teens.The semi-annual Taking Stock with Teens study indicated that Twitter has overtaken Facebook as the most important social media network.Last year, 42 per cent of teens rated Facebook as the most important social media took, while this year only 23 per cent rated it as the most influential. Data: Twitter has overtaken Facebook as the social media network that is most important to teens, according to Piper Jaffray's semi-annual teen market research report . Twitter was rated by 26 per cent of teens as their 'most important' social media site. Not to be outdone, the Facebook-owned Instagram also garnered 23 per cent of votes, up from 12 per cent last year. The study by investment firm Piper Jaffray gathers information relating to teen spending patterns, fashion trends, and brand and media preferences. Another study, Pew's Teens, Social Media and Privacy report, had similar findings. Pew focus groups said the popularity of Facebook is waning because of parental and adult use of the site, other users 'over-sharing' and 'drama' that can erupt between Facebook 'friends'. According to Pew research, despite its lack of 'cool,' teens continue to use Facebook because 'participation is an important part of overall teenage socializing.' Sociable: Among teens, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram are the top social media networks, but Facebook's popularity is waning . The study also noted that teens have an average of 300 Facebook friends but only 79 Twitter followers. 'I got mine [Facebook account] around sixth grade. And I was really obsessed with it for a while. Then towards eighth grade, I kind of just - once you get into Twitter, if you make a Twitter and an Instagram, then you'll just kind of forget about Facebook, is what I did,' one teen told Pew researchers. Zuckerberg himself may concur with teens who think Facebook is no longer cool. Uncool: Mark Zuckerberg says no longer being cool is not a problem for Facebook . 'People assume that we’re trying to be cool. It’s never been my goal. I’m the least cool person there is! We’re almost 10 years old so we’re definitely not a niche thing any more so that kind of angle for coolness is done for us,' he told the Atlantic in September. Instead of being cool, he wants Facebook to be a tool people use every day, 'like electricity.' The Piper Jaffray study lists other social media sites such as Tumblr and Google+, 17 per cent responded in the category marked 'other.' This indicates that other niche social media sites such as SnapChat and Vine are taking off in a big way with teens.","Teens rated Twitter the 'most important' social media network with Facebook and Instagram close behind .

"Interest in jobs at Virgin is likely to soar following suggestions by Billionaire boss Richard Branson that people should be able to take time off work whenever they want. Branson wrote, in an excerpt from his new book, The Virgin Way: Everything I know About Leadership: 'It is left to the employee alone to decide if and when he or she feels like taking a few hours a day, a week or a month off.' Branson, who released the material on his blog, said the plan was in action at Virgin officers in Britain and the U.S. If it worked, he said, he would encourage all of the company's subsidiaries to stop counting holiday leave. Scroll down for video . Virgin boss Richard Branson believes that people should be able to take vacation time whenever they want . Branson said he began considering the concept after his daughter told him Netflix was doing it . He said the plan worked on the assumption that employees will only take time off when they think it won't impact on them or the company. Branson said he first decided to try out the plan after seeing an article on how Netflix did not track staff vacation time. He recalled his daughter telling him: 'I have a friend whose company has done the same thing and they've apparently experienced a marked upward spike in everything –- morale, creativity and productivity have all gone through the roof.' Branson isn't the first billionaire to publicly advocate for a more flexible work-life balance. Branson, pictured here with his staff during the Virgin trains 'Arrive Awesome' campaign earlier this month, said the plan was already in action at Virgin offices in Britain and the U.S. In an interview posted on YouTube Google co-founder Larry Page recently said: 'If you really think about the things you need to make yourself happy -- housing, security, opportunity for your kids ... it's not that hard for us to provide those things.' He added: 'The idea that everyone needs to work frantically to meet peoples' needs is not true.'","Richard Branson said it should be 'left to the employee alone' to decide .

"Oprah Winfrey has said racism is still a problem around the world and the only way for it to end is for generations of racists to die out. In an interview with the BBC to coincide with the release of her latest film The Butler, the chat show host said generations had been 'marinated' in racism. The 59-year-old added that President Obama was treated with disrespect because of the color of his skin and said she feels fortunate to have been born after segregation ended in the U.S. Pressing issue: Oprah Winfrey talks about the problems of racism during a BBC interview . When asked if some of the challenges faced by Obama were down to the color of his skin, Winfrey, who had been a high-profile backer of his presidential campaign, said: 'There's no question'. She highlighted an incident in 2009 when . Republican congressman . Joe Wilson called out 'you lie', as Obama gave a speech to Congress. 'I think there's a level of disrespect for the office that occurs,' she said. 'And . that occurs in some cases ... because he's . African American. There's no question about that. And it's the kind of . thing no one ever says, but everybody's thinking.' Her opinion upset some critics, with a news website dedicated to 'exposing and neutralizing liberal media bias' accusing her of 'playing the race card'. The News Busters site said Winfrey was narrow-minded for focusing solely on racism against the black community, and added that it was 'patently absurd to suggest that racism is caused by old white people when racism and religious bigotry cut across all generations and ethnicities'. Support: Winfrey, pictured here during her backing for Barack Obama's campaign, says the President faces challenges because he is African-American . While Winfrey may have focused on the treatment of African-Americans in the U.S. and under Apartheid, she added: 'As long as people can be judged by the color of their skin, problem’s not solved.' Winfrey told BBC Art Editor  Will Gompertz that she feels lucky to have been born in Mississippi five years after segregated schools were phased out. 'If I'd been born five years . earlier, none, not any of the benefits that I've been blessed to be . successful with would have occurred,' she said. However, Winfrey said that although films such as The Butler and the Scottsboro Boys have helped show how far the civil rights movement had come, more needed to be done to tackle racism across the world. 'As long as people can be judged by the color of their skin, problem’s not solved,' she said. History: Winfrey with Forest Whitaker in The Butler, a story she says people are ready to hear . 'There are still generations of people, older people, who were born and bred and marinated in it, in that prejudice and racism, and they just have to die.' Winfrey, who has a starring role in The Butler, a film about an African-American who serves under eight Presidents in the White House, said she was excited to be part of the film project. 'I thought it was an important story for our time and particularly for young people who won't read the history,' Winfrey said, adding that 'people are ready to hear it'.","Chat show host says Obama faces challenges because he is African-American .

"Shameless Michael Meade, 57, has been jailed after admitting lying about the size of the inheritance, when he received it, cheating the state out of £64,000 benefits  - and even having the cheek to claim more while he was awaiting sentence. Six months ago Meade pleaded guilty at Gloucester crown court to cheating benefits by not disclosing that his wife had a job. He told the court last November that his wife was about to inherit £40-£50,000 and he would use that to repay most of the money he had obtained. Going down: Benefit fraudster Micheal Meade, 57, has been jailed for nine months for cheating £64k in benefits and hiding £100k inheritance . The total Meade obtained illegally was £64,375. But when Meade returned to court to be sentenced this week, Judge Jamie Tabor QC was told that not only has he failed to repay the money, he lied about the size of the inheritance - and the fact that his wife had already received it before the last hearing. Top top it off he had the audacity to make inquiries about claiming more council benefits on the grounds that some of the inheritance has been put into investment bonds, making the capital untouchable. 'Oh dear,' sighed Judge Jamie Tabor QC when prosecutor Simon Goodman told him what had happened since the last hearing. Meade’s solicitor, Joe Maloney, admitted that he, too, was ‘horrified’ when he realised what his client had done. 'He has put himself in something of a mess,' conceded Mr Maloney. Jailing Meade for nine months, Judge Tabor told him: 'When you appeared before me in November you pleaded guilty to a series of offences committed over a considerable period of time. 'There were a number of mitigating factors which I was asked to take into account and one was your poor health. 'Another was the fact that this was not an offence that started out as a crime but deteriorated into one when your wife took employment. 'You pleaded guilty and it was said you, or your wife, were likely to inherit £40-£50,000 and you would be able to repay the majority of the money you had defrauded from the state. 'It now transpires that during the period while you were awaiting your appearance here you had commenced a further fraud, committed while on bail. 'You sought to deliberately mislead this court and you pretended that you might be receiving some money, or your wife would, in the near future. 'In fact by the time you appeared before the court you had already received the sum of £105,000. 'You tell me today that you didn’t know your wife had received that money - I believe that is yet another lie to this court. 'I am afraid any sympathy I had for you at the last hearing has now evaporated.' At the last hearing the court was told Meade had received income support for eight years by saying he and his wife were unemployed and he was on disability allowance. But since 2003 his wife had worked at a children's nursery and the couple would not have been entitled to all the benefits they received. Meade pleaded guilty to obtaining benefits by deception but told the court, through his solicitor, that his wife would soon be inheriting about £50,000 and that could be used to repay most of the benefits. The court was also told that Meade was due to have a triple heart by-pass in the next few weeks as well as investigation for prostate problems. Judge Tabor then agreed to defer sentence on Meade until today to see if he can repay the outstanding money in that time. Meade left court with his wife after that hearing and crossed the road to a disabled parking space where he got into a 61 reg Nissan Qashqai SUV vehicle and drove away. Nissan Qashqais are priced at between £16,500 and £27,000. Meade later insisted the car was not his but is provided for him as part of his disability care package. 'It’s leased through the mobility allowance. I don’t own it - and that’s God’s honest truth,' he said. 'Every three years, on September 14, I get a new car and I get to choose which one I want, but I can’t do anything with it. 'I can see how it would look damn disgusting, but if anybody walked around my house they could see I haven’t got any money.' Living on handouts: Michael Meade in his new 61-reg Nissan Qashqai paid for by the state under mobility allowance . Today Meade admitted an additional offence of continuing to claim housing and council benefit from Cheltenham Borough Council without declaring the £105,000 bequest his wife had received. Mr Goodman told the court: 'Shortly after the last court hearing here the investigations team received an anonymous phone call suggesting Mr Meade had already received the inheritance and, indeed, had been away on holiday. 'He had not declared the receipt of any capital to the council, probate had been granted last June and his wife had received payments of £1,000 on 15th April 2011, £10,000 on 13th July, £85,000 on 29th September and £9,168 on 16th November. 'It was money his wife already had when he last appeared before your honour. 'Not surprisingly, he was interviewed in January and he confirmed he was still receiving council benefits and that he had not told the council about the inheritance because it was his wife’s money.' Despite his wife having received the inheritance before the last hearing Meade had repaid only £261 so far, said Mr Goodman. 'He has even been back into the council and asked for benefits again on the basis that he now has less than £16,000 capital because he has invested a lot of the money in inheritance bonds, which means capital is not available to him, only income.' Joe Maloney told the court the couple have £60,000 in bonds but are willing to hand them over so that when they mature next year they can be used to repay the debt to the State. 'I am not sure he realised last year what a grave position he was in,' said Mr Maloney. 'I am told he was not aware his wife had received that money.' 'I don’t believe it!' retorted the judge. 'If my wife received £105,000 from a relative I would be a little disappointed in her if she didn’t mention the fact.' After jailing Meade, the Judge instituted a full Proceeds of Crime investigation into his affairs and warning him if he does not co-operate he could end up losing all his assets and being penniless.","Michael Meade, 57, claimed his wife failed to tell him she had received £100k inheritance .

"Totally accurate: Statistician Nate Silver correctly called all 50 states in the US Presidential election using a unique mathematical formula . To every politico, pundit and punter from Seattle to Miami, this was a Presidential election contest between two candidates separated only by a hair’s breadth. ‘It is a toss-up,’ the pundits said. ‘Too close to call.’ Barack Obama against Mitt Romney was so tightly-fought that sitting on the fence was the only way of avoiding being openly pilloried. But one analyst has won nationwide acclaim in America after trusting in his highly complex power of prediction to call Obama’s resounding victory with stunning accuracy. Nate Silver, a 34-year-old statistician who at one time made a living from playing poker, correctly predicted all the states declared so far in what was billed as the tightest election race in decades. Silver’s FiveThirtyEight blog on the New York Times website became essential reading in the last few days before Tuesday’s election as his reputation grew as a pundit prepared to stick his neck out. His highly mathematical approach - which has echoes of the book and Brad Pitt film about baseball statistics ‘Moneyball’ - involves running hundreds of calculations for each state based on myriad factors, including election results from the past and polling data. Silver, an avowed Obama supporter, used his ‘magic formula’ to predict the President’s re-election well before the first results came through. He calculated there was a 90.9 per cent likelihood of an Obama win and that the President would win 332 Electoral College seats compared to 206 for Romney – correct if the Democrat wins Florida, which has yet to declare. His accuracy has drawn widespread praise in the US. MSNBC television host Rachel Maddow said during election coverage: ‘You know who win the election tonight? Nate Silver.’ Chris Taylor, writing a blog on the Politico site, said: ‘Here is the absolute, undoubted winner of this election: Nate Silver and big data.’ One comedian took to Twitter to call him ‘The Emperor of Math.’ Four more years: President Barack Obama was re-elected for a second term with a resounding win over Republican challenger Mitt Romney . Count on me: Silver accurately predicted the outcome in all 50 states and also in the District of Columbia . While the value of statistical analysis has long been appreciated in sport – Silver himself started out studying baseball data – it has long been rejected in politics, where pundits rely on ‘gut feeling’ to call the results. But after this week, Silver suddenly finds himself as the poster boy for a new ‘Moneyball’ approach to election punditry. Taylor went on to proclaim: ‘What does this victory mean? That mathematical model can no longer be derided by ‘gut-feeling’ pundits. ‘That’s Silver’s contention – TV pundits are generally no more accurate than a coin toss – must now be given wider credence.’ John Sides, a political scientist at George Washington University, went further: ‘It shows that we can use systematic data – economic data, polling data – to separate momentum from no-mentum, to dispense with the gaseous emanations of pundits’ ‘guts’, and ultimately to forecast the winner.’ But Silver beating the traditional pollsters shouldn’t have come as a surprise – in the 2008 election, he was right on 49 out of the 50 states and all 35 Senate contests. The following year, Time magazine named him one of the world’s most influential people. Power of stats: Silver's methods have drawn comparison with the 2011 baseball film Moneyball, which starred Brad Pitt as coach Billy Beane (left) and Jonah Hill as statistician Peter Brand (right) His stock is now higher than ever. The New York Times public editor Margaret Sullivan called him their ‘most high-profile writer at this particular moment.’ Twenty per cent of visits to the NY Times website in the build-up to the election included a look at his blog. Silver, born in Lansing, Michigan, graduated from the University of Chicago with a degree in economics after spending his third year of study at the London School of Economics. He briefly worked as a Chicago-based consultant for KPMG, though later described it as ‘a job I didn’t like’. In his spare time, he developed a program for projecting baseball player performance called Pecota. Silver resigned from KPMG in April 2004, having become a writer for the website Baseball Prospectus, to whom he sold his Pecota system in return for a partnership interest. Prior to the 2008 election, he switched to politics, saying: ‘In politics, there’s a lot of partisan screaming and conventional wisdom that’s conventional but not very wise.’ No chance: Silver was widely ridiculed when his calculations gave Republican challenger Mitt Romney just a 10 per cent chance of victory . In 2010, his existing blog at FiveThirtyEight.com was bought by the NY Times and Silver revealed his models for predicting election results, based on a combination of electoral history, demographics and polling. In the early part of 2012, it became more and more clear that Silver was backing Obama to win a second term, drawing criticism of his methods from Romney supporters and right-wing pundits. Even others within the NY Times expressed doubts – the highly-respected columnist David Brooks wrote: ‘If there’s one thing we know, it’s that experts with fancy computer models are terrible at predicting human behaviour.’ MSNBC Morning Joe host Joe Scarborough called him ‘a joke’, and summed up the views of most pundits by adding: ‘anyone that thinks that this race is anything but a toss-up right not is such an ideologue, they should be kept away from typewriters, computers, laptops and microphones for the next ten days.’ Silver challenged Scarborough to a bet on Twitter, saying: ‘If you think it’s a toss-up, let’s bet. If Obama wins, you donate $1,000 to the American Red Cross. If Romney wins, I do. Deal?’ His predictions prevailed and won a new respect for statistical methods. But there was no election night triumphalism from Silver. In his final blog post, he simply wrote: ‘There’s a lot more to unpack in the coming days, but first, we’re going to get some sleep and grab a beer.’","Nate Silver, 34, used an elaborate series of calculations to correctly call the outcome in all 50 states .

"More U.S. troops are committing suicide than are being killed in active service in Afghanistan, shocking figures have revealed. Even before not-yet-released data from October, the number of suicides among active and reserve army personnel this year has surpassed the number of combined military combat deaths from January to October 22, according to CNS News. A total of 247 U.S. army personnel are believed to have taken their own lives between January and September this year, army data shows. This compares to 222 deaths from 'hostile causes' in Afghanistan. Shocking statistics: More U.S. troops are committing suicide than are being killed in active service in Afghanistan (file photo) The figures, collated by the Brookings Institution, show an extra 40 troops were killed by 'non-hostile causes' while on deployments in the country. This means their deaths were not caused by the Taliban, insurgency forces or Afghan forces. The latest army statistics on troop suicides were released last Friday and show 15 active duty soldiers are suspected of killing themselves last month alone. The same number of potential suicides was recorded in August. 'Every suicide in our ranks is a tragic loss for the Army family, adversely affecting the readiness of our Army,' Lt. Gen. Howard B. Bromberg, deputy chief of staff for manpower and personnel, said in a Department of Defense release. 'I am asking soldiers, family members, Department of the Army civilians, neighbors, and friends to look out for each other and reach out and embrace those who may be struggling,' he said.

Learning curve: Lori Duron candidly details her family's experience of raising six-year-old CJ - described as a 'boy who is a girl at heart' - in a new book titled, Raising My Rainbow . CJ, who is getting ready to start first grade, says he started liking 'girls' stuff' after he found a Barbie in the back of his mother's closet. He was just two-and-a-half years old. After many conversations, Mrs Duron and her husband Matt made a conscious decision to let their son 'be who he was born to be'. Recalling their first visit to a toy store after the 'Barbie incident', mother-of-two, Mrs Duron said: 'I took him to the pink aisles which I had been hiding from him - just because we have boys, so we went to the blue aisles. Happy at play: CJ seen in his bedroom, which is crammed full of girls' toys . Expressing himself: CJ's mother says he loves practicing his 'fashion walk' in the mirror . ''[When] he saw those pink aisles . . . he just lit up and stood there and took it all in.' Meanwhile CJ's older brother, Chase, preferred to stick to the blue aisle. Six months after making his love of dolls clear, CJ began to gravitate towards girls' clothes. 'It's a whole different thing, when you realize that your son is really into all things girl and really is a girl at heart' Mrs Duron said that he 'sabotaged' her laundry work, took an orange tank top and reappeared wearing it as a dress with a pair of her high heels and a 'mischievous grin'. Mr Duron, a police officer from a male-dominated family 'full of jocks', says that he and his wife were confused and concerned about CJ’s behaviour at first. 'It’s a whole different thing, when you realize that your son is really into all things girl  . . .and really is a girl at heart.' Learning process: Lori and Matt Duron said they were confused and concerned about their son at first . Difference of opinion: While CJ loves pink and dolls, his older brother Chase prefers traditional boys' toys . In a bid to connect with other parents in their situation Mrs Duron started an anonymous blog under the same title as her book, and was soon inundated with similar stories from readers all over the world. 'We're trying to raise CJ to be a strong, confident person and hope for the best and watch out for bullying and teasing' 'It was weird for me to realize that this is a global parenting issue,' she said. In the blog she would detail CJ's day-to-day antics. One post tells how CJ designed his own dress in a hot pink, leopard-print fabric and paired it with 'pink glitter spandex leggings'. And another details how CJ 'skipped' in the air when Mrs Duron said he could inherit her wedding gown. She writes: 'I’m glad that I didn’t purge the dress before I had kids.  I’m glad that I resisted the urge once I had only boys. Frank account: Mrs Duron's blog-turned-book, Raising My Rainbow hit the shelves today . 'Because my boy loves fashion, lace, beading and all things princess-like.  And, he wants my dress and he’s going to love it.' She cites the words of encouragement she received from readers as a great source of support. Now, she hopes her book will educate more people about gender nonconformity. Asked if there are ever instances when he wishes CJ would 'pick up a baseball bat instead of playing with Barbie dolls', Mr  Duron said 'yeah, I mean there's definitely days of frustration.' However, he highlights that the biggest thing he's learned is to 'love your child no matter what.' 'I mean this is an evolution. From where we were when we started noticing this and where we are today, we've grown in leaps and bounds as parents, both of us. 'You know, we've built a house based in love and trust and a safe environment and that's the most important thing I can give to my kids.' Mrs Duron concludes: 'We're trying to raise [CJ] to be a strong, confident person and hope for the best and watch out for bullying and teasing.'

"Miley Cyrus has literally twerked her way to the top. Despite a public shunning from her risque MTV Video Music Awards performance with Robin Thicke in August, scandalous stage antics have been credited with earning the pop starlet $76.5million in 2013, according to Parade’s annual salary survey, What People Earn. Downloads of her single Wrecking Ball shot up 124 percent following the outlandish appearance, allowing the song to sell more than three million copies in the U.S. alone. The former Disney pin-up's earnings do not include any of the revenue she is set to earn from her international Bangerz tour, which is her fourth concert series. Money-maker: Miley Cyrus and Robin Thicke onstage during the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards at the Barclay Center on August 24, 2013. The performance is credit with increasing her popularity and music sales . Cyrus; 2013 earnings to not bring into account the revenue of her worldwide concert tour Bangers, which launched in America in February and is set to make her millions . Big deal: Writer-producer-director Tyler Perry is expect to top the list of 2013 earners, garnering $78 million for his work at the Oprah Winfrey Network . The tour only kicked in February in America and will move to Europe in May. While Cyrus' banking is impressive, it's hardly the most money she has been able to make. In 2011, at the age of 18, she was named #1 on Top 10 Richest Teens in Hollywood, with a net worth of $120 million. Numerous other celebrities made it onto the magazine's annual list, which will officially be released on Sunday. Super-producer Tyler Perry made an estimated $78 million for his work with the Oprah Winfrey Network, providing OWN with three television series that he penned himself. The most successful is soap opera ratings smash The Haves and the Haves Nots. Meanwhile, on the back on the success of comedy The Heat and action -drama Gravity -  among the top 15 highest-grossing in the U.S. in 2013 - Sandra Bullock made an estimated $63 million. However the actress recently denied reports she was set to be paid $70 million from Gravity alone, saying that was 'news to me'. Also providing box office gold was Thor actor Chris Hemsworth, who made a reported $58 million. Beyonce, 32, came close managing  to bring home $57 million following the surprise release of her fifth studio album, Beyonce, featuring the single Drunk In Love. Despite no promotion - fans were not told of the record's existence until it was avaiable, complete with music videos for every track - it became the fast-selling album ever on ITunes following its release on December 13. She sold one million digital copies in six days and became the first woman ever to have her first five studio albums debut at number one. Bruno Mars also made the listl bringing a home a cool $38 million. While . Mars was not paid for his Super Bowl performance, sales of his album, . Unorthodox Jukebox, jumped 164 percent the following week. Pepsi and Hyundai also licensed his songs for commercials. Box office gold: Sandra Bullock is said to have earned $63 million last year, thanks to the combined success of The Heat and Gravity . Like Bullock, award-winning musician earned $66 million, while Australian actor Chris Hemsworth came in close with $58 million, thanks to the Thor sequel . While not making as much as Miley Cyrus, Beyonce still managed to bring home the bacon in 2013, banking $57 million thanks to the surprise release of her self-titled fifth album in December, while Bruno Mars (right) made $38 million . Vice President Joe Biden, 71, was also included in the list, however his earnings were not the same league as the featured celebrities. Biden made $230,000 in 2013. He was received $29,761 in Social Security benefits in 2012. However there are other perks to Biden's job. He enjoyed a ski holiday with his family in Aspen earlier this year that cost taxpayers $115,777.61. The vice presidential family's security detail spent $92,596 on lodging, $17,866.61 on car rentals and $5,315 on flights. Comparatively, Parade adds, the first Veep, John Adams, received a $5,000 salary in 1789. Mathew McConaughey made $19 million, while US Vice President Joe Biden made $230,000 . Rounding out the list was actor Matthew McConaughey, who is thought to have made $19 million. The prolific actor underwent a career reinvention last year, thanks to his Oscar-winning turn in Dallas Buyers Club and critically acclaimed role in HBO series True Detective. McConaughey's upfront fee for Dallas Buyers Club was $200,000.

"GPs are to be forced to hand over confidential records on all their patients’ drinking habits, waist sizes and illnesses. The files will be stored in a giant information bank that privacy campaigners say represents the  ‘biggest data grab in NHS history’. They warned the move would end patient confidentiality and hand personal information to third parties. Data grab: Doctors will be forced to hand over sensitive information about patients as part of a new programme called Everyone Counts but campaigners have criticised the move . The data includes weight, cholesterol levels, body mass index, pulse rate, family health history, alcohol consumption and smoking status. Diagnosis of everything from cancer to heart disease to mental illness would be covered. Family doctors will have to pass on dates of birth, postcodes and NHS numbers. Officials insisted the personal information would be made anonymous and deleted after analysis. But Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, said: ‘Under these proposals, medical confidentiality is, in effect, dead and there is currently nobody standing in the way.’ Nick Pickles, of the privacy group Big Brother Watch, said NHS managers would now be in charge of our most confidential information. He added: ‘It is unbelievable how little the public is being told about what is going on, while GPs are being strong-armed into handing over details about their patients and to not make a fuss. ‘Not only have the public not been told what is going on, none of us has been asked to give our permission for this to happen.’ The data grab is part of Everyone Counts, a programme to extend the availability of patient data across the Health Service. Campaigners for privacy: They warn the move would end patient confidentiality and hand personal information to third parties . GPs will be required to send monthly updates on their patients to a central database run by the NHS’s Health and Social Care Information Centre. Health chiefs will be able to demand information on every patient, such as why they have been referred to a consultant. Another arm of the NHS will supply data on patient prescriptions. In a briefing for GPs, health chiefs admit that ‘patient identifiable components’ will be demanded, including post code and date of birth. NHS officials insist the information centre will be a ‘safe haven’ for personal data, which will be deleted soon after it is received. The information will be used to analyse demand for services and improve treatment. But a document outlining the scheme even raises the prospect of clinical data being passed on or sold to third parties. It states: ‘The patient identifiable components will not be released outside the safe haven except as permitted by the Data Protection Act. ‘HSCIC ... will store the data and link it only where approved and necessary, ensuring that patient confidentiality is protected.’ Personal: The data collected includes pulse rate, weight, cholesterol levels, body mass index, family health history, alcohol and smoking status . Patients will not be able to opt out of the system. Before . the election the Tories condemned the creation of huge databases – . including the controversial NHS IT project – and insisted it would roll . back ‘Labour’s database state’. But . last month, in the first sign of a dramatic shift away from this . position, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he wanted millions of . private medical records to be stored and shared between hospitals, GPs, . care homes and even local councils. He sold the programme as part of . plans for a ‘paperless NHS’ by 2018 and claimed ‘thousands of lives’ would be saved. But details . of the changes have raised serious concerns among civil liberties and . privacy campaigners, as well as health professionals . Last night GPs’ leaders said the latest proposals were too broad. ‘Patients . must be given the option to opt out of any scheme that seeks to . transfer identifiable information about them from their records to . another source,’ said a BMA spokesman. ‘This opt-out should be widely advertised . and explained in order that patients are reassured and understand the . process being carried out.’ Phil Booth of the campaign group NO2ID said an unprecedented volume of data would be ‘sucked up’. ‘People have to trust in the notion of medical confidentiality. They expect to be able to talk in confidence to their GP,’ he said. ‘They don’t expect their private conversations to be uploaded on to a national database where they will be made available for any number of purposes for the benefit of persons unknown.’ A spokesman for the NHS said last night: ‘The NHS constitution makes clear what information can be used for by the NHS and this proposal complies exactly with that.’","Data includes weight, cholesterol, BMI, family health history and pulse rate .

"Sir Alex Ferguson says European managers are divided on the whether the away goals rule should remain part of competitions such as the Champions League and Europa League. Critics of the rule,  introduced for the 1965-66 Cup-Winners' Cup, meaning goals scored away from home are worth double say it has become counter-productive and unfair in the subsequent half century. 'There was a bit of a debate about whether it has any significance today,' said Sir Alex Ferguson after a meeting at the elite coaches' forum at UEFA headquarters on Thursday. VIDEO Scroll down for Sir Alex Ferguson talks Champions League favourites and sin-bin . Fergie time: Sir Alex Ferguson says European managers are split on the relevance of the away goal rule . Winner: Chelsea lost 3-1 at Parc de Princes but Eden Hazard's goal won them the 2013-14 Champions League quarter final tie against PSG . 'Some think it is not as important as it used to be... and the attacking emphasis on the game today means more teams go away from home and win. 'If we go back, say, 30 years, counter-attacking consisted of one or maybe two, players. Today, counter-attacks have players flooding forward in fives or sixes and really positive, quick passing.' The rule first came into play in a second-round Cup-Winners' Cup tie as Hungarian side Honved went through at the expense of Dukla Prague after they were 4-4 on aggregate after two legs. At the time it was seen as preferable to having a time-consuming play-off or the arbitrary toss of the coin which was sometimes employed, famously sending Liverpool to the European Cup semi-final in 1965 after two goalless draws against Cologne. In the early days of European competition, when air travel was far less developed and reliable, an away match was an adventure with visiting teams facing unfamiliar, sometimes hostile, conditions. Away wins were rare and the new rule was an incentive for visiting teams to come out of their shell - but that is far less of a problem now, as playing conditions in most parts of Europe are pretty much identical and trips abroad no longer carry the air of intimidation they once did. 'What is helping is that the state of the pitches, pitches are fantastic nowadays, so coming out of defence with passes is much easier than it was 30 years ago, and you get a better attitude to counter-attack today than you did 30 years ago,' said Ferguson. Rather than encouraging visiting teams to attack, the fear of conceding a potentially decisive away goal often makes home teams more cautious and the rule also means that some goals turn out to be worth more than others. 'From a personal point of view, when I was playing at home, I used to say to myself, don't lose a goal,' said Ferguson. Last year's Champions League saw the away goal scored by Chelsea's Eden Hazard in their 3-1 quarter-final first leg loss to Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc des Princes prove the difference in the tie as they won 2-0 at home and went through to the semis.

"A drama student who became an internet sensation after claiming he was savagely beaten up for being gay has admitted he caused his injuries himself when he tripped on the pavement. Richard Kennedy, 18, from Blackpool, told police he was set upon by a gang of homophobes when he left a gay nightclub in Preston, Lancashire, prompting officers to appeal for information about what they called a 'particularly nasty assault'. He posted photographs on Facebook of his battered and bleeding face, dislodged teeth, and gaping knee wound, with the caption 'An example [of] why homophobia is wrong and it's disgusting that it's still around in 2014'.  The post was shared by more than 182,000 well-wishers. Drama student Richard Kennedy, 18, from Preston, Lancashire, said he had been beaten by homophobes . Kennedy put photos of his injuries online, saying his teeth bad been pushed back into his mouth in the 'attack' Leg wound: The teenager reported the 'attack' in Preston city centre to police, who launched an investigation . But today the teenager, who studies Contemporary Theatre and Performance at the University of Central Lancashire, admitted he made it all up. After being shown CCTV of him tripping and falling, face-first, onto the pavement, Kennedy accepted that the 'utterly inhumane homophobic attack' he had talked about actually never happened. This afternoon Lancashire Police, who carried out a 'detailed and thorough investigation' into the alleged attack two weeks ago, confirmed CCTV showed the teenager had not been attacked by anyone, and had simply hurt himself when he fell over. But police said Kennedy will not face any action for wasting police time as they were convinced he actually believed he had been assaulted when he spoke to police. Detective Inspector Paddy O’Neill said: 'We managed to recover some CCTV footage which shows the injured party falling face-first onto the pavement. We have showed him the CCTV and he now accepts his injuries were caused during the fall. 'Having had oversight of the investigation... I accept his report was made in good faith.' 'Savagely beaten': But student Richard Kennedy was later shown CCTV showing he simply fell over . He added: 'I am conscious that the initial reports into this incident will have been very upsetting for a number of people, and Preston city centre was portrayed in a very negative light. 'Thankfully, there was no homophobic assault or any other assault on this occasion.' After the alleged 'attack' outside the Evoque nightclub shortly after 3.30am on 26 February, Kennedy told how he was knocked to the ground and stamped on with such . ferocity, four of his teeth were . dislodged. He also said he struggled to walk after suffering . injuries to both knees. The student later angrily relived his 'ordeal' on Facebook, posting before and after pictures and lamenting how 'stupid' he had been to walk home alone in a post which quickly went viral. He wrote: 'Here is my face after a homophobic attack: four of my teeth are gone, not fallen out but deep inside my gums and cheek... my face is swollen, both my knees are badly injured and I struggle to walk... Kennedy won't be charged with wasting police time as he really believed he had been attacked, police said . 'My whole face is constantly throbbing and I'm now on four tablets a day for pain and infection and may require surgery to sort out the damage. 'All of this and what was their motive?  Because of my f****** sexuality.' Police initially said Kennedy was left so disorientated by the attack, he could not recall exactly where he was assaulted. It is believed he walked around Preston city centre in a confused and distressed state for some time before police were alerted by a passerby. In an interview with his local paper, he said: 'I heard a group of men shouting homophobic abuse at me. Student: Kennedy studies contemporary theatre and performance at the University of Central Lancashire . 'The next thing I know I was punched in the back of the head. I was violently assaulted - all because of my sexuality. 'I was covered in blood and had my face stamped on, causing my teeth to go into my gums. I might need surgery to amend the damage done. It’s absolutely disgraceful to violently attack someone because of who they are.' Kennedy went on: 'From all of this, all I want is awareness...I want people to see what can happen if you are as stupid as me to be alone on a night out'. Today Kennedy’s latest Facebook message made no mention of the police investigation.  It read: 'If you’re gay then you’re gay, if you’re straight well that’s great.'","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Chaos followed the release of Nike's Air Jordan 11 Gamma Blue sneaker on Saturday morning as fights broke out in stores across the country between customers keen to get their hands on a pair. Each year, the highly anticipated release of a new version of limited edition Air Jordans is released and each year, a spate of robberies, assaults, riots and even deaths occur. This year, videos and photographs from around the country depict frenzied crowds fighting in queues outside sports stores and inside shops. Store brawl: These young men got into a fight inside a sportswear store as they tried to purchase Air Jordans . Violence: An inexplicably shirtless young man is punched repeatedly over a pair of sneakers . One video that has surfaced shows a fight inside . a Weberstown Mall shoe store in California which appears depict various . separate skirmishes over the sought-after shoes. One shirtless boy is knocked the ground and repeatedly punched while elsewhere in the store another is tackled. It is unclear whether the young men are fighting over the last pair of shoes, or why one of them is not wearing a shirt. According to Fox 40, police responded to the store but the crowd had dispersed and no arrests were made. In Dallas, police were called to the Southwest Center Mall after a fight broke out in the queue for the shoes. People had begun lining up to purchase the sneakers overnight in anticipation of the shoe's release on Saturday morning. According to Fox Dallas, a group arrived around 6am and tried to cut to the front of the line. No one injured in the brawl but police remained at the store for the opening to ensure no further sneaker-related rage occurred. Cult status: Many have questioned the veneration of a shoe named after a player who hasn't been on-court in more than a decade . In New York, shoppers in the Bronx spoke of fights, ripped clothing and police presence as shoppers, many parents trying to secure a pair of shoes for their children, waited outside Foot Locker. A shot of the scene posted to Instagram shows a huge crowd watching as a group of girls fought before the store opened. One shopper explained that the street cred of wearing a pair of Air Jordans made the ordeal worth it. 'I mean, technically it's not. But for bragging rights, it is. It is, it's worth it for bragging rights, it is,'  she told News 12, after she explained that she'd been waiting for 12 hours to get her hands on a pair. Sneaker freaks: A group of girls brawls in the crowd massed outside a Bronx Foot Locker store awaiting the release of the latest Air Jordans . Last week in Ohio shoppers managed to pull a door entirely off its hinges while they piled into the Champs Sports shop at Eastland Mall. The shoes were not even on sale until Saturday but the store was handing out vouchers that would enable shoppers to buy the shoes on Saturday. Officers were also called to disperse an 'unruly' crowd in Florida on Friday night after a sports store manager decided not to sell the sneakers due to the size of the crowd and the limited number of sneakers the store had.The shoes retail for $185. A new, limited edition version of Air Jordans are released each year, and each year similar violence and frustration erupts.

"Microsoft hopes a new 'selfie phone' will help it lure people away from Apple and Google handsets. It also called for the industry to 'amplify the message around security' of cloud photo sharing services in the wake of the 'fappening' celebrity picture leaks. The firm claims the Lumia 730, which has a special wide angle 5 megapixel front facing camera, is 'built for Skype and selfies'. Scroll down for video . Chris Weber of Microsoft, shows off the new Lumia Selfie App at the consumer electronic fair IFA in Berlin. 'I think we have to amplify the message around security regarding these cloud services,' Weber told reporters. Microsoft's new Lumia 730 and 830 phones won't have all the technical advances found in Microsoft's pricier flagship, the Lumia 930 phone, which is known as the Lumia Icon in the United States. The 730's rear camera takes 6.7 megapixel shots, while the 830 is 10 megapixels. By contrast, the 930 phone is at 20 megapixels, one of the highest in a smartphone. The 830 has a 5-inch screen and will cost about 330 euros ($435) before tax, compared with 440 euros for the Samsung Galaxy S5 and 515 euros for the iPhone 5. The 4.7-inch 730 will cost 199 euros. It will have 3G connectivity and slots for two SIM cards, an important feature in emerging markets where wireless plans vary widely such that users switch services often to get the best deals. A 4G version will be known as the 735 and will cost 219 euros. The handset is expected to coast around $240 in the US, and comes with a special selfie app. Microsoft will seek to draw more people to its Internet-based services with the two new mid-range smartphones. The devices unveiled Thursday are under the Lumia brand Microsoft bought from Nokia. They run the latest version of Windows Phone 8 and feature Cortana, a Siri-like voice assistant available to help with directions, calendar appointments and messages. Many of those interactions will steer users to Microsoft services such as Bing search and OneDrive storage. Chris Weber, Microsoft's vice president for mobile devices sales, said consumers should feel comfortable about storing their personal pictures on OneDrive, despite recent hacks exposing celebrities' private pictures stored on services such as Apple Inc.'s iCloud. 'I think we have to amplify the message around security regarding these cloud services,' Weber told reporters.

To this end, Microsoft is also giving users more control over the kind of information - friends, diaries, home address - that the Cortana voice assistant will have access to, he said. Microsoft bought Nokia's phone business in April as it seeks to boost Microsoft's Windows Phone system, which has had little traction compared with Apple's iPhones and Google's Android system. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has made mobile phones and Internet-based services priorities for the company as its traditional businesses - Windows and Office software installed on desktops - slow down or decline.

"A Florida fisherman got the shock of his life when he reeled in his fishing line to find this monster on the end. Steve Bargeron was fishing from a dock in Fort Pierce as he watched a fellow fisherman pull this strange creature out of the water. Mr Bargeron described the giant sea creature as being about 18 inches long. The shrimp was striking its own tail, so the fisherman grabbed it by its back like a lobster. Floridian Steve Bargeron was fishing from a dock in Fort Pierce when he saw this massive shrimp from the water.Mr Bargeron described it as about 18 inches long and said he grabbed it  like a lobster . The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said they are stumped as to the exact species of the underwater creature. But they believe it could be some type of mantis shrimp - which is actually neither a mantis nor a shrimp at all, but a kind of crustacean called a stomatopod. These creatures may can reach 12 inches in length, or even longer in  exceptional cases - which would put this catch at the extreme end of the scale. The mantis shrimp is one of the major invertebrate predators on coral reefs, sea grass beds and sand and rubble flats, but relatively little is known about the species. But the creatures are known for their large stalked compound eyes, which give them incredibly complex vision. They live in crevices or in burrows that they build themselves and are surprisingly agile. The second distinctive feature of the mantis shrimp is the powerful claws that they use to attack and kill prey by spearing, stunning or even dismemberment. Experts believe the underwater creature could be some species of the  mantis shrimp . This has earned the creatures the nickname 'thumb splitters' – due to their ability to inflict painful gashes using their claws if handled incautiously . In captivity, some of the larger species of mantis shrimp are capable of breaking through glass with a single strike. There are thought to be more than 400 species of mantis shrimp, coming in a variety of colours, from shades of brown to distinctive bright neon. Some of the brighter species use the fluorescent patterns on their bodies behavioural signals for contacting other mantis shrimp. They have surprisingly developed memories and are able to recognise individual neighbours that they have interacted with on a frequent basis previously.. The crustaceans can also recognise each other by visual signs and even by individual smell, and many have developed complex social behaviour to defend their space from rivals.","The alien-like creature was pulled from the water in Florida .

"Honeytrap: Mundill Mahil was jailed for six years for causing grievous bodily harm . A medical student was yesterday found guilty of her part in a plot that left a besotted admirer dead. The man, who she claimed had attempted to rape her, was lured to her home then beaten unconscious before being left to die in a burning car. Mundill Mahil, 20, decided to ‘play God’ when she recruited two men to carry out the fatal attack on Gagandip Singh, who she claimed had attacked her six months earlier. The virgin told Mr Singh she wanted 'closure' and even reassured the wary businessman following a text from him asking: 'Are we going to talk civil or do you want me dead?' After inviting her victim to her student home, he was kicked, punched and struck with a camera tripod, then put into the boot of his car. The vehicle was then driven to a quiet London side street and set alight. The post-mortem examination revealed Mr Singh was still alive when the fire began. Yesterday, Mahil was found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm for her role in the attack, and was warned by the judge it is ‘virtually inevitable’ that she will be given a long jail sentence. Her two conspirators were also convicted of murder and manslaughter respectively. As the verdicts were read out, a woman had to be removed from court screaming uncontrollably. Mahill and her victim were two young people with much in common – both devoutly religious, fiercely intelligent, and from solidly respectable Sikh families who wanted the very best for their children. Had events unfolded differently, Mr Singh, a 21-year-old entrepreneur who founded a global television station dedicated to the Sikh community, could have had a stellar business career. Mahil would by now have been more than halfway through her studies to become a doctor, well on her way to accomplishing her dream of saving lives. Killers: Harvinder Shoker (left), and Darren Peters . (right) beat Gagandip Singh unconscious before bundling him into a car boot and . setting the vehicle alight . Tragically none of that is possible now. Instead Mahil, who used to work with disabled children, will soon be imprisoned. In a trial at the Old Bailey lasting more than two months, jurors were told it was a revenge killing in retaliation for his attempted rape of Mahil the year before. That attack was never reported to police so what really happened between them will never be known. 'Revenge': Mr Singh was attacked by the two men at Mahil's university home and driven away in a car that they set on fire . What is known is that she lured Gagandip – Gagan to his family – to his death in February last year by sending him a text saying she wanted to talk to him. So oblivious was he to her true motives that when he arrived at the home she shared in Brighton with five fellow medical students, Mr Singh was carrying a teddy bear and flowers as gifts for her. After inviting him in, she led him to her bedroom, where two male friends were lying in wait. One, Harvinder Shoker, 20, was a fellow Sikh who knew Mr Singh but was infatuated with Mahil. The other was Shoker’s school friend, Darren Peters, 20. As Mahil ate Key Lime Pie in the kitchen, the two thugs mercilessly beat Mr Singh unconscious, then wrapped him in her duvet and placed him in the boot of his car. They then drove to Blackheath, south London, doused the Mercedes – and the victim – in petrol, and set it alight. Within days Mahil and her co-conspirators had been arrested and charged with murder. In court, Mahil claimed she hadn’t asked Shoker, who was convicted of murder, and Peters, found guilty of manslaughter, to kill Gagan but just give him ‘a couple of slaps’ to help him ‘mend his ways’. But speaking outside court yesterday, DCI Damian Allain, of Scotland Yard’s homicide and serious crime command, said: ‘Her actions were calculating and she was at the heart of a criminal conspiracy of tricking Gagandip to Brighton to seriously assault him, which ultimately resulted in his death. ‘All this from a medical student, embarking on a career in the caring profession. I have no doubt that but for her actions, her deceit and trickery that night, Gagandip’s death would not have happened.’ Mahil and Mr Singh met at a Sikh festival in Wolverhampton in 2009 and the businessman was soon besotted with the pretty young student, although no romance developed. Scene of death: Singh was driven to a quiet alley in Blackheath, south east London, where the car he was in was set alight and he was left to die . But after his father was murdered while attending a wedding in the Punjab, India, the pair became closer. Mahil, an undergraduate at Brighton and Sussex Medical School spent hours, often long into the night, comforting him on the phone and chatting online. Then, one evening in August 2010, Gagan spent the night with Mahil at her student digs. Both he and she were to refer to what happened between them that evening as attempted rape although, because of their strict moral and religious code, whether it was rape in the usual sense of the word is unclear. Whatever happened between them, Mahil felt profoundly betrayed afterwards and the friendship quickly soured. Pretty: Mahil, left, and Singh, right, met online in 2009 and the 21-year-old man became infatuated with her . She turned for solace to Shoker, a trainee electrician who she had met through a martial arts course while still at school. ‘Our theory is that he was jealous of the close bond between Gagan and Mahil and wanted to win her affections,’ said a police source. ‘He was willing to do anything for her, even if it meant killing his old friend.’ Mahil, meanwhile, was speaking to her housemates about securing ‘justice’ by exacting revenge on Mr Singh and about her ‘gangster friends’. She turned to Shoker for help and he roped in his friend Peters, a bicycle mechanic. In his closing speech, prosecutor Aftab Jafferjee QC told jurors: ‘For a group of youngsters to decide that they are the custodians of Sikh virtue and play God on the subject of religious duty and moral obligation is a grotesque turn of events.’ Last night Mr Singh’s sister Amandip said she and her mother Tajinder were unhappy with the verdict. She said: ‘We all feel that all of them were 100 per cent responsible for Gagan’s death. It was enormously hurtful to hear what Mundill said about my brother but I never believed it and to be honest anyone who knows him knows the truth.’ His mother Tajinder Kaur said: ‘When I first learnt of Gagandip’s death I was completely and utterly broken. I could barely function on a day-to-day basis and stumbled through each day not really knowing what was going on. ‘Since Gagandip’s death I feel like my heart is completely broken and taken away from me is my son and a source of joy in my day.’ Mahil, of Chatham, Kent, Shoker, of Greenwich, and Peters, of Blackheath, will be sentenced on Wednesday.","Mundill Mahil wanted 'justice' against Gagandip Singh after 'attempted rape'

"White people will no longer make up a majority of Americans by 2043, according to new census projections, part of a historic shift that is already reshaping the nation's schools, workforce and electorate. The official projection, released today by the Census Bureau, now places the tipping point for the white majority a year later than previous estimates, which were made before the impact of the recent economic downturn was fully known. America continues to grow and become more diverse due to higher birth rates among minorities, particularly for Hispanics who entered the U.S. at the height of the immigration boom in the 1990s and early 2000s. Since the mid-2000 housing bust, . however, the arrival of millions of new immigrants from Mexico and other . nations has slowed, pushing minority growth below its once-torrid pace. Scroll down for video . Data: This graph shows the current racial population (green) in regard to the 2060 estimates by the U.S. Census Bureau (orange). These numbers show a steep decline in the number of white Americans while the Hispanic and black populations appear to rise . The country's changing demographic mosaic has stark political implications, shown clearly in last month's election that gave President Obama a second term - in no small part due to his support from 78 per cent of non-white voters. The non-Hispanic white population, now at 197.8 million, is projected to peak at 200 million in 2024, before entering a steady decline in absolute numbers as the massive baby boomer generation enters its golden years. 'The fast-growing demographic today is now the children of immigrants,' said Marcelo Suarez-Orozco, a global expert on immigration and dean of UCLA's Graduate School of Education & Information Studies, describing the rate of minority growth in the U.S. as dipping from 'overdrive' to 'drive.' Even with slowing immigration, Suarez-Orozco says, the 'die has been cast' for strong minority growth from births. As recently as 1960, whites made up 85 . per cent of the U.S., but that share dropped after a 1965 overhaul to . U.S. immigration laws opened doors to waves of new immigrants from . Mexico, Latin America and Asia. By 2000, the percentage of U.S. whites had slid to 69 per cent; it now stands at roughly 64 per cent. Population surge: America continues to grow and become more diverse due to higher birth rates among minorities . 'Moving forward, the U.S. will become the first major post-industrial society in the world where minorities will be the majority,' Suarez-Orozco said. 'With the white baby boomer population now leaving the work force, the most fundamental challenge will be connecting with this fast-growing U.S. group in terms of their education.' The U.S. has nearly 315 million people . today. According to the projections released Wednesday, the U.S. population is projected to cross the 400 million mark in 2051, reaching . 420.3 million a half century from now in 2060. Shift: Hispanics, currently 17 per cent of the population, will more than double in absolute number, making up 31 per cent, or nearly 1 in 3 residents . By 2060, whites should drop to 43 per cent of the U.S. At that time, blacks will make up 14.7 per cent, up slightly from today. Hispanics, currently 17 per cent of the population, will more than double in absolute number, making up 31 per cent, or nearly 1 in 3 residents. Asians are expected to increase from 5 per cent of the population to 8 per cent. The point when minority children become the majority is expected to arrive much sooner - 2019. Last year, racial and ethnic minorities became a majority among babies ages 1 and younger for the first time in U.S. history. At the same time, the U.S. population as a whole is aging, driven by white baby boomers born between 1946 and 1964. Over the next half century, the 'oldest old' - those ages 85 and older - is projected to more than triple to 18.2 million, reaching 4 per cent of the U.S. population. The actual shift in demographics will be influenced by a host of factors that can't always be accurately pinpointed - the pace of the economic recovery, cultural changes, natural or manmade disasters, as well as an overhaul of immigration law, which is expected to be debated in Congress early next year. 'The next half century marks key points in continuing trends - the U.S. will become a plurality nation, where the non-Hispanic white population remains the largest single group, but no group is in the majority,' said acting census director Thomas Mesenbourg. Changes: The non-Hispanic white population, now at 197.8 million, is projected to peak at 200 million in 2024, before entering a steady decline in absolute numbers as the massive baby boomer generation enters its golden years . Republicans have been seeking to broaden . their appeal to minorities, who made up 28 per cent of the electorate . this year, after faring poorly among non-whites on Election Day, when . Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney carried only about 20 per . cent of non-white voters. The race and ethnic changes are already seen in pockets of the U.S. and in the younger age groups, where roughly 45 per cent of all students in K-12 are Hispanics, blacks, Asian-Americans and others. Already, the District of Columbia and four states - Hawaii, California, New Mexico and Texas - have minority populations greater than 50 per cent; across the U.S., more than 11 per cent of counties have tipped to 'majority-minority' status. Last month, nearly all voters over age 65 were white (87 per cent), but among voters under age 30, just 58 per cent were white. 'Irrespective of future immigration and minority fertility patterns, the U.S. is facing a stagnating white population,' said William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution. Stalled: Since the mid-2000 housing bust, the arrival of millions of new immigrants from Mexico and other nations has slowed, pushing minority growth below its once-torrid pace . 'The biggest shift will occur over the next 20 years as the mostly white baby boom generation moves into traditional retirement years. It is in the child and early labor force ages where we must be ready for the greatest changes as new American minorities take over for aging whites.' The rapidly growing non-white population gives the U.S. a bit of an economic advantage over other developed nations, including Russia, Japan and France, which are seeing reduced growth or population losses due to declining birth rates and limited immigration. The combined population of more-developed countries other than the U.S. has been projected to decline beginning in 2016, raising the prospect of prolonged budget crises as the number of working-age citizens diminish, pension costs rise and tax revenues fall. Depending on future rates of immigration, the U.S. population is estimated to continue growing through at least 2060. In a hypothetical situation in which all immigration - both legal and illegal - immediately stopped, previous government estimates have suggested the U.S. could lose population beginning in 2048.","Number of white Americans now at 64 per cent, but scales will tip in the favor of Hispanics by 2043 .

She met the Samsons in the Philippines two years ago and agreed to move to England with them to care for their children. According to local reports, the nanny went to the Philippines for an extended holiday with the Samson family in December last year. Write caption here . Mr and Mrs Samson then returned to Britain, while Miss Alpas stayed on to visit her family. Shortly before the nanny flew back to England, Mr Samson reportedly asked her to visit his house in Nueva Ecija to pick up some documents for him. The nanny texted her sister on March 20 to say she was going to her to Mr Samson’s home and that someone was picking her up at the bus station. Police chiefs said that was the last time her family heard from her. Her relatives launched an online Facebook campaign to find her but, on March 25, a farmer reportedly found her head in a bucket in an irrigation canal in Barangay San Fernando Sur, Nueva Ecija. She was apparently identified from a passport and documents found nearby. Chief inspector Eric de Venancio told the Mail: ‘We have charged Elcielo with murder in his absence. He is still at large. A Facebook page was set up calling for justice for Maribel whose head was found in a canal in the Philippines . ‘He was seen near the canal before the head was found. ‘We have not been able to contact Mr Samson. I am asking him to get in touch with me so I can ask him further questions.’ He added: ‘According to the victim’s relatives, Mr Samson asked Miss Alpas to go to his house to collect some documents. ‘We searched the house after the head was found and discovered some ashes in the back yard of the compound. Miss Alpas was described as ¿always smiling¿ and 'family-orientated' by her grieving relatives . ‘Forensic officers found these were human remains and bones. We have yet to establish if these belong to Miss Alpas.’ The Facebook page, called Justice for Maribel Alpas, reads: 'You were such a blessing to your Family and Friends. 'You brought so much joy and laughter for over 31 years. 'You will be remembered as the Maribel we used to know and could have been. 'Your memories will always be in our Hearts...' Yesterday, Mrs Samson, 40, expressed her shock at the woman’s brutal death, saying: ‘Maribel was very, very close to us. ‘She was a lovely person. She was a kind person. ‘I myself am really stressed with what happened to her. ‘I was here back in England. She was in the Philippines. ‘We were really, really surprised by what happened, and angry as well.’ Mrs Samson said her children were confused by their nanny’s absence, saying: ‘Our children are only young. They don’t know what’s going on.’ She added: ‘She was close to us. Ask our neighbours, ask whoever knew her. ‘She loved us, and we were the same to her. She was absolutely spoilt. ‘We treated her like a member of the family. As a family, being Filipinos. ‘We don’t even have a harsh word with her, don’t want to say anything to her, with her being here on her own in England and having no family with her. ‘She could just ask for everything. I gave to her food, clothing, like personal things, lotions. Mr Samson has been told not to return to work at Warrington Hospital, where he is a nursing assistant . ‘I even paid for her holiday. If she asked for money to be sent to her family – we had no arguments.’ Maribel Alpas’s sister, Jocebel, who has led the Facebook campaign, said: ‘She was so family-oriented. ‘She was always smiling and was always playfully annoying her nephews and nieces. ‘She didn't want our mother to experience hardships.  Mother will not suffer anymore. ‘She reached the age of 31, but she didn't want to get married yet because still wanted to give us a better life. ‘That was all she wanted, for our family, just for us. ‘She was our breadwinner.  She sent me to college but I was not able to graduate. ‘All of her salary was given to our mother, there were almost nothing left for herself.’ Miss Alpas said that her sister intended to work for the family for two more years, despite the low wages, until she was eligible to apply for British residency and seek work elsewhere. A spokesman for Warrington and Halton Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: ‘The trust has not been made aware of any charges being brought against a member of our staff in relation to an incident in the Philippines and we are currently seeking information from the authorities about the case. ‘While the trust seeks information on the alleged charges the staff member will not be on duty.’","Maribel Alpas, 31, worked for Filipino nurses Dennis and Girlie Samson .

"One woman has found that it is possible to survive for a week eating only the 59 foods represented by emoji - though it is not necessarily healthy. New York-based writer Kelsey Rexroat chronicled her experiment for The Atlantic, noting that the diet is 'essentially the opposite of Atkins' due to its emphasis on desserts, rice-heavy items and alcoholic drinks. Not only did Ms Rexroat limit her consumption to items with emoji counterparts, but she challenged herself to eat every emoji food during the seven days. Picture-perfect diet: Kelsey Rexroat spent an entire week eating only the 59 foods represented by emoji . While items such as milk and bananas were already in her fridge, unfamiliar images forced her to consult the Emojipedia, a site that identifies each symbol by its official name designated by the Unicode Consortium. Fortunately she was able to find oden - a broth filled with eggs and fish cakes - at a neighborhood restaurant, and dango - a sweet dumpling dish - at a local Japanese food market. While Ms Rexroat was happy to eat more seafood and fresh fruit, she also cites sugar and white rice as common themes. 'Of the 59 food emoji, eight incorporate rice, and 11 are desserts,' she found. New discoveries: Through the challenge, Ms Rexroat tried dishes such as oden, a fish cake stew (left), and dango, sweet dumplings (right) Just desserts: Ms Rexroat found the emoji diet heavy on sweets such as ice cream (left) and cookies (right) There are also plenty of boozy beverages: After imbibing red wine, sake, a tropical cocktail and beer during her first four nights, she notes 'clearly the emoji diet is not for teetotalers.' She also realized that items such as chips, popcorn and garlic are sorely missing from the emoji world. 'I have a moment of dismay when I realize there is no cheese emoji, and I must pass up the aged Gruyere I had bought a few days earlier,' she says during a dinner of spaghetti. Currently, a Change.org petition for a hot dog emoji has more than 407 supporters. 'Of the 59 food emoji, eight incorporate rice, and 11 are desserts' Ultimately, Ms Rexroat writes: 'The emoji diet hasn’t left me hungry or dissatisfied - if anything, my dessert binge has added some pounds - but it has slimmed down my wallet, since I’ve been making more food purchases as I avoid the majority of my pantry.' In another recent experiment, a New York couple used nothing but emojis in texts to each other for a month and found that it actually improved their relationship. Alex Goldmark and Liza Stark sent each other only symbols and pictures to see if it 'altered their emotional vocabulary' in an experiment for New Tech City. They discovered that emojis are better for conveying affection and positive feelings, but are (unsurprisingly) lacking when it comes to making plans and discussing logistics.","New York writer Kelsey Rexroat consumed all 59 emoji foods during the seven days .

"An eight-year-old Arizona girl who was allegedly snatched from her parents' home in the middle of the night and killed by a family friend died of asphyxiation by strangulation. The details of Isabella 'Bella' Grogan Cannella's death were released by the Mohave County medical examiner on Friday, a day after Justin James Rector was charged in her killing. Authorities would still not reveal if the young girl, whose body was found half-a-mile from her home in Bellhead City on Wednedsay, was sexually assaulted. At a press conference on Thursday, Police Chief Brian Williamson said they were still trying to determine a motive for the murder. Rector, 26, had been staying with Bella's family for a few days before she went missing in the early hours of Tuesday, Williamson said at the press conference. Scroll down for video . Arrest: Bella Grogan-Cannella, left, was reported missing on Tuesday morning after her family could not find her anywhere in her Arizona home. Justin James Rector, right, has now been arrested in her killing . Her 10-year-old sister told authorities that she saw Bella with Rector when she went to the bathroom around 11.30pm on Monday, and when she returned to her room, her younger sister and the older man were gone, Williamson said. Bella's family reported her missing around 1.30am on Tuesday. Later that morning, Rector allegedly shoplifted clothing from Walmart and attempted to hide the clothes he'd been wearing at the time of the alleged murder, Williamson said. Cops arrested him for shoplifting that day and questioned him in relation to Bella's disappearance. Killed: Bella's body was found in a shallow grave near her family's home on Wednesday, police said . Grieving: Bella poses for pictures with her mother, Tania, who had reported her missing on Tuesday . When her body was found on Wednesday, authorities also discovered 'unique' shoe prints that matched the shoes Rector had been wearing, Williamson said at the press conference. He was charged with kidnapping and murdering her on Thursday. Williamson said he has not ruled out the possibility of further charges or future arrests. 'My heart goes out to Bella, her family and this entire community,' Williamson said. 'We have completed the mission of bringing someone to justice for Bella's death.' Just hours after Bella was reported missing on Tuesday, Rector wrote a bizarre Facebook rant saying he was not a suspect. 'Everyone gonna believe what they chose but as of now shes still not home and talking s*** n making threats doesnt seem like a good strategy on getting her home to me,' he wrote at 8pm Tuesday. 'Everyones a suspect but ive been interrogated and cleared no charges and im still in touch with the authorities.' Facebook profiles reveal that he was friends with Bella's mother, Tania, and other relatives. Suspect: Rector, who is also from Bullhead City, is friends with some of Bella's family members . Heartbroken: Bella's mother Tania was seen screaming at the scene where the body was found . Found: A map shows where Bella was last seen and where the body was found, half a mile away . On Thursday, KNXV-TV reported that investigators served a search warrant at the family's home and could be heard telling people in the residence to come out with their arms up. Bella lived at the home with her mother, stepfather and other children who are not Isabella's siblings, said police Lieutenant Jerry Duke. Isabella's biological father is not in the area. Dozens of police, firefighters and volunteers have fanned out in Bullhead City neighborhoods, nearby parks and river areas to look for Isabella using ATVs and search dogs. On Wednesday night, Bella's mother, Tania, was seen sobbing and screaming 'No!' as relatives comforted her at the wash where the girl's body was found, ABC13 reported. Crosses and candles were placed at the scene where the body was found on Wednesday as relatives held each other and wiped away tears. 'Everybody has come together,' her grandmother Sue said through tears. 'It's been wonderful, so we appreciate everything.'

"Craig Gardner believes West Brom's derby win over Aston Villa has reunited the club and he challenged the Baggies to pull away from danger. The midfielder scored his first goal for Albion in the 1-0 victory at The Hawthorns on Saturday, just their second win in 10 Barclays Premier League games. It eased the pressure on head coach Alan Irvine after fans had started calling for the axe and lifted the Baggies to 14th in the table. Craig Gardner believes West Brom's derby win over Aston Villa has reunited the club . 'We knew if we won the local derby it would catapult us up the league, get everyone back on side, get the fans back on side, because we need the fans, we need everyone at the club,' said Gardner, who started his career at Villa. 'We got the whole team, the whole club back together. 'This win can have a really galvanising effect, definitely. The fans, seeing the work rate we are putting in, seeing we are not hiding . 'It is a platform to build on. It's four points from two games and we can really push on now.' Gardner scored the only goal of the game as West Brom beat their local rivals Aston Villa 1-0 on Saturday . Gardner celebrated his goal with Irvine and also handed his shirt to young fan Rui Roper at the end of the game. He said: 'It was nice to give a little bit back, I'm a fan myself. I've been in that position that little lad has been in. It's nice, he'll remember that for the rest of his life. He's going to go home, probably sleep with the shirt on, tell his friends and family. 'I do know the kid, he was in my eye line. It was going to go to a kid and lucky enough I knew him. I know his dad.' Defeat ended Villa's five-game unbeaten run and they will have to deal with suspensions for Kieran Richardson - after he was sent off - and Alan Hutton and Tom Cleverley after they received their fifth bookings of the season. Gardner ran to high-five his manager Alan irvine after scoring the only goal of the game at The Hawthorns . Fabian Delph and Ron Vlaar returned from injury but boss Paul Lambert knows they need more depth. He said: 'I don't think we have the strongest (squad depth), but we've got Fabian back and (Philippe) Senderos is close but I think you are always trying to improve the quality and squad size.' Vlaar returned as a late substitute after a thigh problem but Lambert insisted his skipper is not guaranteed a place after the form of Jores Okore and Ciaran Clark. He said: 'The really pleasing thing is that Okore had 14 months out and is coming in like this, and Ciaran looks outstanding. 'I think he has always been up and down but playing the way he is is the best I've seen him. They look good as a pair, they have a good understanding. Sometimes you stumble on things and these two lads have been absolutely fantastic. Ron will see himself the two lads have been great, but it is good to have Ron back and pushing again.' Both Paul Lambert and Irvine have been under pressure at their clubs due to poor results .","West Brom beat local rivals Aston Villa 1-0 in their Premier League clash .

"Amid all the Apple hubbub over the last few days, Dell quietly released the world’s thinnest laptop. The sleek device features an edge to edge display and multiple cameras for true 3D images. It runs Android 4.4 and will go on sale at the end of the year in the US and possibly other countries, although a price has not yet been announced. Scroll down for video . Earlier this week, while Apple was busy revealing its new iPhone and Apple Watch, Dell quietly released a new tablet in San Francisco. The Dell Venue 8 7840 (press image shown) is 6mm (0.24 inches) thick making it the world's thinnest tablet. It also comes with four cameras, three of which can take '3D images' The device was announced at the 2014 Intel Developers Conference in San Francisco, reports Gizmodo. Called the Dell Venue 8 7000 series, the tablet is a mere 6mm (0.24 inches) thick, beating Sony’s 6.4mm (0.24 inches) Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact. It has an 8.4-inch screen with a 2560 x 1600 OLED panel built by Samsung. Screen size: 8.4 inches (21.3 cm) Resolution: 2560 x 1600 . Thickness: 0.24 inches (6 mm) Operating system: Android 4.4 . Processor: Quad-core 2.33 GHz Intel Atom Z3580 . Storage: 32GB . Release: Late 2014 . In addition to this, the glass of the so-called 'Infinity Display' stretches almost from edge to edge. This particular model, the Dell Venue 8 7840, comes with four cameras. Three of them are on the back, with the main one being eight megapixels. The other two enable use of Intel’s RealSense technology. This is intended to be able to take 3D images and possibly allow for gesture control akin to Microsoft’s Kinect, although this feature has not been confirmed for the tablet. Michael Dell, founder and CEO of Dell Inc, speaks about the new Dell Venue 8 7000 series tablet at the 22014 Intel Developers Conference in San Francisco on Tuesday 9 Sept in San Francisco.  The Dell Venue 8 7000 Series tablet is the world's thinnest tablet with the world's best tablet display available . In Dell's tablet the RealSense technology is used to allow images to be finely tuned, with a user able to adjust focus after an image has been taken. The RealSense technology can even be used to measure the distance between two points in a photo so, for example, by taking a picture of a table you could work out its dimensions with a few taps. Dell also says the tablet has smart albums that ‘enhance and organise every amazing image’. An optional adapter will also enable the device to be connected to a keyboard and mouse.

"Oakland firefighter Keith Jones was off-duty and with his sons at the firehouse when a cop confronted them with his weapon drawn . A new video has revealed the terrifying moment that a police officer drew his weapon at a black firefighter and his two young sons at a firehouse. Oakland firefighter Keith Jones was off-duty and with his boys, aged nine and 12, when he passed a station house and noticed that the garage doors were lying open on August 15. As he went to close the doors at Station 29, an Oakland police officer confronted the family. Video from the police officer's chest camera was published by KPIX on Wednesday. On the footage, which is almost entirely dark, the cop can be heard telling Jones to put his hands up. Mr Jones, 43, responded: 'I'm an Oakland firefighter. That's my truck right there.' The father also told the police officer: 'I respect what you’re doing... It’s not a problem.' The father told KPIX that he thought the officer was going to shoot him, saying the officer was in a crouched position ready to fire his gun. Mr Jones, a 16-year veteran with the city's fire department, added: 'If we were white, I truly believe he would not have approached my kids that way.' On the video, the firefighter can be heard trying to calm one of his sons who is crying during the frightening interaction. Later on the tape, once the firefighter has handed over his ID, the officer, who has not been identified, can be heard apologizing for his mistake. 'It's not a problem,' Mr Jones responds. Scroll down for video . Mr Jones, pictured with his nine and 12-year-old sons, told KPIX that he believed the police officer would not have confronted him in that way if they were white . The incident happened close to 11pm as the father and sons headed home from an Oakland Raiders game. As they passed the fire house, where Mr Jones does not work, he noticed the garage doors were open and stopped his car to close them. SFGate reported that Oakland police said the Fire Department called them to ask if an officer could check on the doors at Station 29 because they had accidentally been left open by a crew who rushed out to a call. The Oakland chief of police told CBS that the officer acted within policy after reviewing the tape. Mr Jones had requested an internal affairs investigation at the police department. MailOnline was awaiting a response from Oakland Police Department. The fireman was driving home from an Oakland raiders game with his two sons on August 15 when he noticed the doors open at a fire station where he doesn't work and stopped to correct them . The Oakland police officer's grainy camera footage does not reveal much - but he can be heard telling someone to put their hands up before he identifies himself as a firefighter.

"David Cameron is testing an iPad app that helps him run the country. Developed by the Cabinet Office, it is called the 'Number 10 Dashboard', and lets Cameron and other ministers see key information at a glance. A description of the app says that 'with a few taps or swipes of his fingers, he can see very quickly what important new information has come to light, how certain government services are performing, and a selection of relevant and important news reports'. Scroll down for video . The Prime Minister is testing a 'Number 10 Dashboard' app to help him keep on top of Government business. The app is hosted by the Government Digital Service (GDS) inside the Cabinet Office, and consists of a number of onscreen tiles, each of which can be selected to show more detail. They include: . Mr Cameron has been using it to keep track of live data relating to jobs, housing and other areas, it has been confirmed. Alice Netwon, one of the developers behind the project,  worked with him, giving him early versions of the app and getting direct feedback. 'It's a dashboard to give the prime minister and other senior official the most up to date view of government priorities from housing to national business or growth,' she said. 'They will have access to the latest government and external data, as well as commentary and analysis by top analysts in the government. ''When the prime minister opens up the app the first thing he will see is a page giving him the daily political context. Miss Newton worked with the PM to develop the project. 'This had been built with the Prime Minister. 'It was incredible valuable to speak to my users, but my favourite thing he said was that he was looking forward to showing it to Obama at the G8.' Miss Newton said Mr Cameron 'in particular liked the statistical side, where we could give him quotable facts about what was going on,' she said on a website about the project.' It also monitors polls and posts on social media, allowing the PM to instantly see reaction to policies and news events. Much on the work on the app has been around making it simple to understand, and the Cabinet Office said data would be 'visualised in a very simple, easy-to-digest way.' The Cabinet Office said the app would be offered to more government figures next year. Mr Cameron is 'looking forward to showing it to President Obama at the G8 summit', a person working on the project told the BBC. Mr Cameron's iPad was a gift from Apple, according to a gift list disclosed by the government, and he has previously admitted to being a huge fan of the game Angry Birds. The new app, which is actually a web page, was developed by the Cabinet Office's digital team and takes data from sources including Google, Twitter and Facebook, putting them on a single page. The app is believed to resemble the data.gov.uk site with large tiles showing key information . The Cabinet Office confirmed to the BBC today it was 'working on a data visualisation dashboard to provide ministers and civil servants with information on key public services as well as other indicators. 'The dashboard is in working form and is now undergoing further development'. The app is believed to have a look and feel similar to that of the government's data website, data.gov.uk. A Cabinet Office source confirmed to the BBC that the app, which is still in its testing phase, is currently on the prime minister's iPad, as well as devices used by a select group of staff within the Cabinet Office. It is believed the app will be rolled out across Government next year as part of a major digital overhaul. 'If you want to provide ministers and officials with information about performance of government, you can look at government data - but you can also look at data from the real world,' said the source. 'All we're doing is bringing government into line with what leading companies, big and small, have been doing for several years. 'It's radical for government, but it's not radical for 2012.' The Prime Minister recently boasted that he had completed every level of the game Angry Birds. At the time, Andy Payne of the Association for UK Interactive . Entertainment, who met Mr Cameron to discuss gaming, said: ‘He . absolutely loves it. He wants to know what other top games he should get . for his iPad.'","The 'Number 10 Dashboard' is set to be rolled out across government next year .

"Lewis Hamilton ended Friday practice in ominous form after clocking a time over half-a-second quicker than title rival Nico Rosberg. Rosberg  had the measure of Hamilton in the day's opening session, but the Briton responded in emphatic fashion on Friday afternoon finishing 0.6secs clear of his team-mate. The session was suspended on two occasions after Pastor Maldonado lost control of his Lotus before crashing into the barriers, while Sauber's Esteban Gutierrez also spun. Maldonado was taken to the on-track medical centre for precautionary checks and was given the all-clear. Reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel was forced to sit out the session with an exhaust problem. Life in the fast lane: Lewis Hamilton was an impressive 0.6seconds clear of title rival Nico Rosberg . He's done it again: The session was red-flagged after Pastor Maldonado lost control of his Lotus . Mess: The Lotus mechanics will face a race against time to put Maldonado's car back together for qualifying . 1. Lewis Hamilton Mercedes 1:49.189 . 2. Nico Rosberg  Mercedes 1:49.793 . 3. Fernando Alonso Ferrari 1:49.930 . 4. Felipe Massa Williams 1:50.327 . 5. Jenson Button  McLaren 1:50.659 . 6. Valtteri Bottas Williams 1:50.677 . 7. Daniil Kvyat Toro Rosso 1:50.725 . 8. Daniel Ricciardo Red Bull 1:50.977 . 9. Kevin Magnussen McLaren 1:51.074 . 10. Nico Huelkenberg  Force India 1:51.077 . Hamilton, 11 points adrift of Mercedes team-mate Rosberg with eight races remaining, conjured a time of one minute 49.189 seconds for the seven-kilometre Spa-Francorchamps circuit. Rosberg had edged Hamilton in FP1 by a mere 0.097secs as Pirelli's medium-compound rubber - the slightly slower tyre this weekend - took centre stage. But come the soft-tyre runs in FP2, Hamilton crushed Rosberg, who ran wide on one of his final hot-lap attempts, scattering gravel over the renowned track. Ferrari's Fernando Alonso was third quickest in both sessions, at least suggesting a podium is on the cards on Sunday even if both Mercedes run reliably, which has not been the case of late. Driving seat: Hamilton heads into this weekend's Belgian Grand Prix 11 points adrift of team-mate Rosberg . Alonso was three quarters of a second down on Hamilton, and the only other driver to finish within a second of the 29-year-old Briton. Williams, considerably off the pace in FP1 but suggesting they had far more in the tank as they are expected to be Mercedes' closest rivals this weekend, showed a little more of their hand in FP2. Felipe Massa was fourth fastest, but 1.138secs in arrears, with team-mate Valtteri Bottas a further two places and 0.340secs adrift. Sandwiched in between the Williams pair, and suggesting McLaren are edging ever slowly towards respectability, was Jenson Button, albeit with the 34-year-old nearly 1.5secs down. Off the pace: Rosberg was over half-a-second slower than team-mate Hamilton in the second session . Toro Rosso's Daniil Kvyat and the only driver other than Rosberg or Hamilton to win a race this season in Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo were seventh and eighth, the latter 1.8secs back. As for Ricciardo's four-time champion team-mate Vettel, the German suffered more technical misery this season as he sat out the entire second session due to his car requiring a power-unit change, so finishing at the bottom of the standings without a time to his name. He completed only 11 laps in the morning session. McLaren's Kevin Magnussen and Nico Hulkenberg in his Force India completed the top 10, both just under two seconds off the pace. Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen was a lowly 15th, albeit seeming to focus on long-run pace than outright speed as he finished 2.3secs behind team-mate Alonso. Back on board: Max Chilton took over from Alexander Rossi but was 1.3seconds adrift of Jules Bianchi . Marussia's Max Chilton, on Thursday out of a drive due to what the team claimed were 'contractual issues' but reinstated following a 'change of circumstances', was 18th. Chilton had sat out FP1 in favour of reserve Alexander Rossi, who appeared poised to become the first American for seven years to race in a GP. Back behind the wheel of his car again, the 23-year-old Briton was five seconds behind Hamilton and 1.3secs off team-mate Jules Bianchi. The Caterham duo of Marcus Ericsson and Andre Lotterer were 19th and 20th, split by just 0.043secs. Three-times Le Mans 24 Hours winner Lotterer, making his debut at the age of 32 and 12 years after his only previous F1 experience with Jaguar as a reserve, has replaced Kamui Kobayashi, apparently for this race only.","Hamilton was 0.6secs quicker than title rival Rosberg in second session .

Suge Knight has revealed pictures of his wounded torso after he was shot six times at a party hosted by Chris Brown. Pictured, five bullet holes are visible on the rapper's stomach along with a surgical scar where doctors opened him up to check no organs were damaged . Knight was shot five times in the torso and chest and a sixth time in the arm during an attack at a pre-VMA party in an LA club hosted by Chris Brown . Together: Chris Brown was hosting a VMA pre-party when Knight was attacked, and police say the gunman targeted his victim contradicting earlier reports that Knight had stepped into the line of fire . Fortunately surgeons say none of his organs were harmed during the assault, according to TMZ. Knight returned home from hospital on Wednesday as reports surfaced that investigators are  looking at several 'people of interest' whose names or street monikers had come up in interviews, the New York Daily News reported. The images were released a week after investigators said footage taken inside the LA nightclub where the attack took place shows Knight was targeted by the gunman. Knight, 49, was shot at an album release party hosted by Chris Brown at 1Oak in West Hollywood in the early hours of Sunday. Two others, including 19-year-old model Megan Hawkins, were shot at the pre-VMA party and all three were rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. 'Video . shows the suspect with a handgun firing at Knight [and] striking the . two other victims who were in his vicinity,' Los Angeles County . sheriff's Lt. John Corina told CBSLA. After firing, the suspect started running for the exits alongside partygoers. Corina added that he did not know if the two other victims, Hawkins and a 33-year-old man, were targeted.

Knight, the co-founder of Death Row Records with Dr. Dre and the rapper The D.O.C., is no stranger to the effects of gun violence. His friend Tupac Shakur was shot multiple times during a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas in 1996 - although during a previous visit to 1OAK, Knight told reporters that no one had ever been charged with Shakur's murder because he wasn't really dead, and was instead living on an island. Knight also suffered a gunshot wound to the leg during a shooting at a 2005 pre-VMA party, hosted by rapper Kanye West.

"It is not often that opportunities have been squandered during this blissful summer for Rory McIlroy but one certainly slipped through his fingers in the first round of the BMW Championship on Thursday. At five under par with three holes to play, the Open and USPGA Champion was two shots clear and threatening to make one of his ominous opening day statements in this penultimate event in the race for the $10 million bonus for the FedEx Cup. Bogeys at his 16th and 17th holes, however, rather changed the complexion of his round and turned the spectacular into the merely very good. The frustrated look he wore at the end was that of a man feeling short-changed. Good start... but Rory McIlroy will be kicking himself for a poor finish in the opening round . He is still the joint leader after a 67, mind, albeit in a tie now with Americans Jordan Spieth and Gary Woodland. An enormous crowd turned up to watch McIlroy fly the ball prodigious distances through the thin Rocky Mountain air. For 15 holes it was his work around the greens that must have left his fellow competitors with the all-too familiar feeling they lacked the necessary firepower. Three birdies in a row to start his back nine were all due to his short game prowess but, for once, he struggled thereafter to keep the ball on the fairways. ‘It is still a really good start but there were definitely a couple of sloppy bogeys at the end,’ said McIlroy. ‘It’s tricky out there. You’re hitting irons and fairway woods off the tees but they’re still running into the rough, while the greens are getting quicker all the time. You’re having to land the ball ten yards before where you were landing it in practice.’ Flying out the traps: McIlroy made light work of the first 15 holes . Falling away: McIlroy's bogeys at the 16th and 17th meant he was forced to share top spot on the leaderboard . McIlroy warmed up in spectacular style, clearing the netting at the far end of the driving range – just the 370 yards away - and landing his ball on the adjoining University Boulevard. Here at storied Cherry Hills, jaws dropped at the iconic 1960 United States Open when Arnold Palmer thrashed at his ball in trademark style to drive the 318 yard par four opening hole. Now here was McIlroy, creating another legend with drives that were literally finishing out of sight. On the course itself, the driver remained largely sheathed thanks to the thick rough that placed a high premium on hitting the fairways but there were still a couple of near 400 yard boomers. The altitude helps, of course, with the ball thought to fly 5-8 per cent further for most golfers. When you hit it as high as McIlroy, though, it is more like 15 per cent. ‘I also hit a 3-wood 370 yards in practice, so that was pretty good,’ said the 25 year old. ‘The ball seems to be going forever.’ McIlroy’s driving has become such a buzz topic that American Erik Compton was desperate to accompany him in a practice round to see for himself what all the fuss was about. On the tee: Justin Rose hits a drive on the first hole during the first round of the BMW Championship . In contention: Rose of England hits his tee shot on the ninth hole on his way to a one-under-par round of 69 . His verdict? ‘I played with Tiger during his all-conquering summer in 2000 and what I saw today was comparable with what I saw playing with Tiger except Rory has more power,’ he said. ‘Rory is a lot longer than Tiger ever was. I have never seen anybody play with that kind of power and control.’ With the Ryder Cup looming every closer, it’s inevitable these final two FedEx events will be analysed to see who’s in form and who is not. Half the European team are among the 70 players competing here – that number will be whittled down to just 30 for the finale next week, the Tour Championship – and there were a number of encouraging performances. In addition to McIlroy, Martin Kaymer and Sergio Garcia shot 68s, while Henrik Stenson was two under playing the final hole when the horn sounded for a weather suspension. He will finish up on Friday. Justin Rose was a bit like McIlroy in feeling he had let a great round slip away. He started with three straight birdies but had to settle for a one under par 69. Graeme McDowell, in his first round since becoming a parent for the first time, was the only European to finish over par. He was three over with his 18th hole to finish on Friday morning. Spieth was by miles the best of the 12 American Ryder Cup players on view, with none of the others managing to finish in the top 20 on day one. Of most concern for captain Tom Watson on his 65th birthday would have been the lamentable performance of Patrick Reed, who shot 77.","Northern Irishman falters late on after flying out of the traps .

"For all the moves before 11pm, click here . Manchester United's gazumping of neighbours City for Radamel Falcao will see the odds on their top-four finish fall, much like the torn-out pages of Louis van Gaal's big black tactics folder as he gets to work on his his new 3-2-5 formation. While it isn't the solid-foundation defensive player that everyone outside of Ed Woodward's mission control believes United need, this signing is a goals guarantee and it also deals a blow to both Manuel Pellegrini and Arsene Wenger, for whom Falcao's prolific scoring profile would have been perfect. One of the key reasons Real Madrid stepped back from signing him – and he has been on a plate for them all summer – is that it was understood he would eat into the goals tally of both Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale, not to mention replace the president's favourite Karim Benzema. VIDEO Scroll down for Radamel Falcao scores brilliant acrobatic scissor kick in training . Goals: The Colombia striker has been prolific throughout his career, earning several big money moves . Strength: Falcao is physically very good, but will not want to play too much with his back to goal . Heading for greatness: As good in the air as on the floor, Falcao is a real handful for even the best defenders . Whereas the occasionally hapless-in-front-of-goal but unstintingly selfless Frenchman is happy to play best supporting actor to Bale and Ronaldo's leads, Falcao would have stolen the show. He would not have been running away from goal to vacate space for Ronaldo to fill, he would have been heading straight for the edge of the six-yard box where he has scored so many of his goals for River Plate, Porto and Atletico Madrid. He scored 52 times in just 67 games for Diego Simeone in Spain and nine in 13 in World Cup qualifiers for Colombia before injury kept him out of the tournament. He may not lead the line like Diego Costa, he may not have the variety of goals that Leo Messi has, the long-distance shooting of Ronaldo, the work-rate and sacrifice of Luis Suarez, the elegant touch of Roberto Lewandowski or the presence of Zlatan Ibrahimovic but as a straight up and down finisher Falcao is second to none. 'I watch the Premier League a lot,' he told Sportsmail last season, 'I like how competitive it is and how teams who are very direct in terms of looking for the opposition's goal as quickly as possible. The football goes back and forth and that makes it a fascinating league.' Pedigree: The striker has scored goals wherever he has played, including 52 league goals in 68 games . Poacher: Inside the box there are few better than the Colombian who is one of the world's best finishers . Injury worry? Falcao missed out on the World Cup with Colombia but insists he can remain at the top level . Click here to read about the move and click here for more of Falcao's movements . That desire to be part of the attack-orientated Premier League is born of an inherent ability to see the space before any defender, run into it, and finish first time with maximum power and accuracy and the minimum fuss. He will thrive on the early balls into the area that Di Maria, Rooney and Juan Mata (if he survives the latest tactical readjustments) can provide. Falcao was also at pains to make it clear that the physical side of English football would not be a problem in spite of his injury record. 'The French league is also very physical. The players are very physical and all the teams are. Technically the top two might be ahead of the rest but physically all the teams are very strong,' he said. United will be more than aware of the cruciate ligament tear in his right knee sustained at the end of 2013 but the decision of Colombia coach Jose Pekerman not to take the 28-year-old to Brazil and hope that he reached full fitness before the end of the tournament will help what is now his comeback season. Predator: Falcao heads straight to the six-yard box and will guarantee goals for whoever signs him . Short stay: Falcao's Monaco switch was always seen as a year out, and now it appears he has made his move . Loan star: The forward will join Manchester United on a season-long loan on a £200,000-a-week deal . Injury or no injury the feeling last season was that Falcao was taking a year out. The decision to go to Monaco always looked short-term. Even the Ligue 1 side seemed to have resigned themselves to losing him despite being back in the Champions League, hence their apparent willingness to let him move away. A fan of the Colombian side Millionarios where Alfredo Di Stefano played, Falcao wants to go back and play for his local club one day before he finishes in the game. First though, he says: 'I want to play in the English league a some time in my career. 'I hope to be playing for many more years yet in Europe.' Now after the pains of watching the World Cup from a distance, his time to make the move has come. Life's a beach: Falcao spent the summer on holiday after injury prevented him playing in Brazil .

"Victim: Three-year-old Joseph Seevaraj died of tonsillitis after a 'gross failure' by an out-of-hours GP service . With his thick, dark hair and big brown eyes Joseph Seevaraj was the most angelic-looking little boy. The energetic three-year-old loved nothing more than giggling his way through his favourite film, . Madagascar — a cartoon tale about a gang of zoo animals who escape captivity. But today, his ability to deliver a convincing — ‘almost scary’ — impression of a lion can only be a cherished memory for his parents Jean and Nicola Seevaraj. Because at the age of three years, one month and 19 days, Joseph died of tonsillitis: a death that could, and should, have been avoidable if not for a terrible failure by a German-born and trained out-of-hours GP. ‘If we had been able to see our own GP, who knew us, he would have known whether we were over-anxious parents or whether we had a legitimate concern,’ says church minister Jean, 37, of Hove, near Brighton. ‘If we had been able to speak to our family GP that weekend, I believe Joseph would still be alive.’ The family’s story is a damning indictment of failings in the out-of-hours system — raising particular concerns about the reliance of private providers on foreign doctors, who may have language difficulties and who may not have trained in the UK. It was in January 2008 that Joseph began to suffer with the symptoms of a cold. The family visited their GP and Joseph was treated for conjunctivitis, but a couple of days later, he was still very unwell. ‘He had foul breath and when I looked on the internet I saw it could be a symptom of tonsillitis,’ says Jean. ‘When I looked in his mouth there were white spots on his throat, another symptom, so I called the GP, but there was a message saying that because it was out-of-hours — it was a Saturday — to call Brightdoc.’ Jean duly phoned the service, part of South-East Health Ltd, which was formed in 2006 following the merger of two smaller out-of-hours providers. After speaking to a nurse and later a doctor, the worried parents took Joseph to an out-of-hours medical clinic at Royal Sussex County Hospital, also run by Brightdoc. They did so, and he was diagnosed with tonsillitis and prescribed antibiotics. Hospital: Joseph's parents took him to an out-of-hours clinic at Royal Sussex County Hospital where he was given antibiotics . The couple took their son home, but the next day he began vomiting and suffering with diarrhoea, symptoms they now know can be an indication of blood poisoning, a rare complication of severe tonsillitis. Concerned, they rang Brightdoc that evening. Jean relayed Joseph’s symptoms and was told a doctor would call back. It was 11pm when Dr Tilo Schippers phoned. Jean told the doctor — who trained in Germany — he was concerned his son was dehydrated and unable to retain the drugs. He asked if he should take him back to hospital. But Dr Schippers — who, Jean says, . seemed to struggle to understand some of what he was saying — insisted . there was no need to panic. 'I knew something terrible had happened. Joseph’s eyes were open, but he wasn’t responding to anything... It was the worst moment of my life.'- Joseph's father Jean Seevaraj . Jean will never know for sure whether language difficulties had an impact on the doctor’s decision to tell him not to worry, that it wasn’t necessary to take Joseph for further medical treatment. But privately he suspects there was an issue. ‘Whether or not he fully understood me, I’m not sure,’ he recalls. ‘I do know that I struggled to get my point across about Joseph’s condition, whether that was because of difficulties understanding the language or because he was at the end of a shift, probably a long one, I don’t know. But I do know that at the coroner’s inquest questions had to be re-asked and rephrased several times for him to fully grasp what was being asked. ‘If there is an issue with language, then that person should not be taking calls from patients where they have nothing to rely on other than what is being communicated verbally to them.’ But then, the couple had no reason not to put their faith in the doctor. ‘He was a professional,’ Jean says. ‘We assumed he knew what he was doing.’ Reassured, they settled Joseph in a travel cot in their bedroom and hoped that his condition would improve by morning. ‘We moved him into our room because we wanted him close at hand,’ says Jean. ‘The last time I saw him alive was at 3.30am. I gave him a bath because of his diarrhoea, and then put him in his cot . . .’ Jean woke to the piercing sound of his wife’s screams at 7.30am. Out-of-hours: There are concerns language barriers may be a problem when providers source doctors from overseas (file photo) ‘She was frantic,’ he says. ‘I knew something terrible had happened. Joseph’s eyes were open, but he wasn’t responding to anything she did. It was the worst moment of my life.’ At an inquest into their son’s death, a coroner said Joseph had died because of a ‘gross failure’ by the out-of-hours GP to provide basic medical attention. She criticised him for failing to take proper notes, and for, fatefully, flouting guidelines that state a patient who has contacted the service three times and is continuing to deteriorate should be assessed in person. The inquest was told that had Joseph been taken to hospital, the septicaemia that claimed his life could have been treated. For Jean and Nicola, who have three daughters and a baby son, the ordeal of Joseph’s death continues with the knowledge that Dr Schipper, who left the UK after their little boy’s death, returned in 2010 and has been able to continue working here, despite the coroner’s coruscating remarks. ‘There are clearly still holes in the out-of-hours system,’ says Jean. ‘I sincerely hope lessons can be learned so no other family has to go through such a devastating experience.’","German doctor told parents of three-year-old Joseph Seevaraj he was fine .

"Danny Welbeck delivered for under-fire Roy Hodgson as the Arsenal striker scored a brace in England's 2-0 win over Switzerland in their opening Euro 2016 qualifier. The former Manchester United outcast found the net after breaks in the 58th minute and in time added on as England, much maligned after their uninspiring 1-0 friendly win over Norway, got off to a perfect start against their main Group E rivals. Here, Sportsmail's Martin Keown gives his verdict on the performance of the players. Confidence: Danny Welbeck was man of the match against Switzerland after scoring twice . Winner: England players crowed around Danny Welbeck after the Arsenal signing scored against Switzerland . Cool finish: Welbeck takes his chance four minutes into time added on with aplomb . ENGLAND (4-4-2) JOE HART: Made a good save with his feet in the first half and did well to stop another in the second just before England’s goal. 7 . JOHN STONES: Still something of an emergency right back but will be pleased with his night’s work when under pressure. 6 . Leg out: England goalkeeper Joe Hart saves an excellent Swiss chance with his out-stretched right leg . GARY CAHILL: Consistent, solid and made a match-saving clearance in the second half to block a certain Swiss goal on the line. 7 . PHIL JONES: A mixed bag. Solid but at times too theatrical with his defending but unlucky not to score with a textbook header. 6 . Strong: England's Phil Jones gets a good connection on a header but sees it well-saved by the Swiss keeper . LEIGHTON BAINES: Would have liked to see him get forward more but an improvement on the Norway game and did well defensively. 6.5 . JACK WILSHERE: Not sure he’s the one for that deep-lying role and occasionally ran into trouble with nobody to cover him. 6 . Too deep: Jack Wilshere was put in a holding role that he wasn't entirely comfortable with . JORDAN HENDERSON: Would like to see him more on the ball but his energy cannot be questioned. He didn’t stop running all night. 6 . FABIAN DELPH: An over-enthusiastic start but played with great responsibility and unlucky not to win a penalty on debut. 6.5 . Mixed night: Fabian Delph got off to an over-zealous start but justified his inclusion on his starting debut . RAHEEM STERLING: Not his best night and didn’t run at people like he does for Liverpool but a fantastic pass for Welbeck’s first goal. 6.5 . WAYNE ROONEY: Showed good touches, reliable in possession and did well to drive forward and release Sterling for the goal. 6.5 . DANNY WELBECK: Seems like his move to Arsenal has instantly given him the confidence to be the main striker. 8 . Danger man: Raheem Sterling finds space as he threatens the Swiss defence but didn't have a great game . Skipper: England captain Wayne Rooney fires a header over the top . SUBSTITUTES .

'I maybe have a little bit more experience than other players - if I can help them, I'm happy to help them. 'When I meet the team, start training with them and start my first game, I will realise. For now, I have just seen the city.' Having moved to AC Milan in January 2013, Balotelli now admits it was a mistake to leave the Premier League.

"Brazil legend Ronaldo believes it is merely a matter of time before Neymar is considered the world's best player. The 38-year-old believes Neymar has given the Brazil team a much-needed boost, and that the Barcelona star is catching up to Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. 'It is very close. It's about time for Neymar to take his place as the best in the world,' the former Real Madrid striker told Brazilian newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo. Brazil legend Ronaldo has insisted it is just a matter of time before Neymar (pictured) is the world's best player . Barcelona star Neymar has been called upon to lead Brazil to be a great national team once again . 'Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi are the best right now, but Neymar has come a long way. The move to Europe has done him good.' And Ronaldo feels Brazil are craving someone like Neymar following a rough spell. 'We do not have many great players,' he admits. 'We are living with hope in Neymar, who is excellent, the country's best, but at other times we had many others who we could rely on to play for the Brazilian team.' Ronaldo believes those such as Ronaldinho, Kaka and Robinho failed to lead the team to its full potential, and that Neymar has to pick up the pieces. Brazil appointed Dunga as manager following their disappointing World Cup on home soil and have won six consecutive matches since. So, was that a good appointment? 'Hard to say. I'm not there and I was not asked about the new management,' adds Ronaldo. 'The trauma of 7-1 (against Germany) very much hurt Brazilians. We can see that this fresh start after six games  is good, OK, but we are still being felt. 'We want to erase that memory. But I have a much better memory, which is 2002 against Germany itself (in the World Cup final). I'd rather stay with this memory.'

"It's the latest member of the Coca-Cola family designed to ease the consumer conscience. Called Coca-Cola Life, it's marketed as having less sugar than regular Coke but none of those artificial sweeteners that increasingly plague Diet Coke drinkers. The new naturally sweetened drink - which contains a third less sugar and calories than regular cola - has been created amid calls for the company to do more to tackle the global obesity epidemic. Sold in a green can or a recyclable bottle, it is already available in the UK, U.S., Chile, Argentina and is due to hit Australian shelves in April. But critics say the product - marketed as ‘healthy’ - may do more to improve the company’s finances than the health of its consumers. Scroll down for video . Coke Life only contains 290 calories compared to the Classic Coke can which has 450 calories - but critics have voiced concerns about it being marketed as 'healthy' Coke Life is sweetened with a blend of sugar and stevia leaf extract - a calorie-free sweetener which is 200- 300 times sweeter than table sugar. A plant used for centuries by Paraguay's Guarani Indians, it has shot from relative obscurity to being used as a key sweetener by large companies such as Coca-Cola and Danone in just a few years. Currently, Coca-Cola Great Britain uses stevia leaf extract as a sweetener in its Sprite and Glaceau vitamin water brands, though critics have complained it has a 'bitter aftertaste', similar to liquorice. A 330ml can of Coke Life contains 89 calories, compared to 139 calories in a regular can of Coca- Cola. Coca-Cola’s other products, Coke Zero and Diet Coke - sweetened with the artificial sweetener aspartame - contain around one calorie each. But the company is facing a growing backlash against such artificial sweeteners such as aspartame and an increased demand for natural products. The solution? Bring out Coke Life for the slightly more health conscious consumers out there known as 'balance-seekers'. Coke’s UK marketing director, Bobby Brittain, has said: ‘We know exactly who our Coke Life will appeal to. ‘It’s 20 and 30-somethings who have begun to realise they’re not completely immortal and that they do have a sense of responsibility about what they consume.’ Some health experts are sceptical about Coca-Cola’s motives and worry about the health implications of a fizzy drink marketed in ‘healthy’ green packaging. Writing for The Conversation, Professor Sandra Jones, director of the Centre for Health and Social Research at Australian Catholic University, said: ‘While stevia is safe to consume, nutritionists have noted that simply removing some sugar and replacing it with stevia doesn’t make a drink (or food) healthy. Coke Life has 89 calories per 330ml can and 22g of sugar. This is more sugar than Diet Coke and Coke Zero but less than 'full-fat' regular Coke . 'Full-fat' Coke contains 139 calories a can, and 35g of sugar, the equivalent of seven cubes . Diet Coke - which is sweetened with controversial sweetener aspartame contains just one calorie . Coke Zero is similarly calorie-free and is made with the same sweeteners as Diet Coke, but has a different flavour base . ‘Coca-Cola Life still contains colouring, caffeine, phosphoric acid and 19 per cent of our recommended daily sugar intake.’ ‘In fact, a cola drink with a few less calories may be part of the problem rather than the answer to reducing our waistlines. People tend to consume greater quantities of foods they believe to be healthy, and seeing a food promoted as healthy can lead people to eat more calories.’ The colour green is associated with healthiness, and so there may be a subtle reason why Coca- Cola decided to stray away from its iconic red-labelling with this product. Professor Jones said: ‘A recent European study found people drink less soft drink from a red-labelled cup than a blue-labelled cup. At a subconscious level, the colour red operates as a stop signal.’ When it was launched, Coca-Cola said that the new drink was part of its commitments to offer consumers reduced, low and no-calorie options – adding that it was the ‘most recent example in a series of initiatives by the company to inspire happier, healthier lives’. The company is a signatory to the Government’s Responsibility Deal, under which the food and drink industry has pledged to promote and healthier diet and make changes to their products. Coca-Cola Life is made from a mixture of sugar and a sweetener made from an extract of Stevia leaf, a plant used for centuries by Paraguay's Guarani Indians . Coca-Cola has committed to reduce the average calories per litre in its range of sparkling drinks by 5 per cent by the end of 2014. But Professor Jones is sceptical about whether introducing Coke Life is consistent with the promise to promote healthier lifestyles. She said: ‘Ultimately, many of these decisions are likely being made to increase the health of the companies' profits rather than the health of their customers.’ A look at The Coca Cola Company’s 2013 financial results shows profits from regular soft drinks are declining and sales of “healthier” options are increasing, she added. She continued: ‘Perhaps the most genuine option for this and other such companies would be to cut back on the production and marketing of sweetened soft drinks and focus on selling products that are actually good for consumers.","Coca-Cola launched Coke Life this year in U.K., U.S., Chile and Argentina .

"Married: Ben Whishaw as Q in Skyfall . He has always been notoriously discreet about his private life, but now it can be revealed that actor Ben Whishaw has entered into a civil partnership. The 32-year-old star ‘married’ his partner, Australian composer Mark Bradshaw, in Sydney last August. The couple met on the set of Jane Campion’s 2009 film Bright Star, about John Keats’s heartbreaking love affair with neighbour Fanny Brawne before his untimely death from TB. Whishaw played Keats in the film, while 30-year-old Mr Bradshaw composed the score. The actor, widely hailed for his brilliance on stage and screen, thrilled audiences last year with his quirky high-tech take on MI6 boffin Q in the Bond film Skyfall. His sexuality has been the subject of a lively internet debate in recent years. Speculation was sparked by an interview he gave to the gay magazine Out in March 2011 while playing a homosexual character in an off-Broadway play, The Pride. When the interviewer asked whether it was important for young gay people to have positive role models, Whishaw replied: ‘I feel in my heart that it’s important, but I don’t quite know yet the way to go about that. Maybe that’s the transitional thing I feel I’m in the middle of at the moment.’ Last night Whishaw’s spokesman confirmed the civil partnership, saying: ‘Ben has never hidden his sexuality, but like many actors he prefers not to discuss his family or life outside of his work. ‘Due to speculation, I can confirm that Ben and Mark entered into a civil partnership in August 2012. They were proud to do so and are very happy.’ A friend of the couple, who live in Hackney, East London, said: ‘Everyone’s delighted for them. Mark’s a lovely guy, very talented and very close to Jane Campion. There hasn’t been a chance for a big celebration because of Ben’s schedule but I’m sure there will be one at some point.’ Happy couple: Whishaw with his partner Mark Bradshaw, left, . an Australian composer. The pair entered into a civil partnership last . August in Sydney . Whishaw with Romola Garai in The Hour: Whishaw is widely regarded as one of the most naturally gifted actors of his generation . Last week the pair attended a party at . the King’s Cross Viewing Platform in Central London to mark the opening . of an exhibition at the Cob Gallery, which is co-owned by the . playwright Polly Stenham. Whishaw . grew up in Bedfordshire in a wholly untheatrical family. His mother . Linda worked at the cosmetics counter in John Lewis while his father . Jose played football for Stevenage before moving into a career in IT. He . also has a twin brother,  James, who is 6ft tall and fair. Whishaw . is widely regarded as one of the most naturally gifted actors of his . generation. When Trevor Nunn cast him as the youngest-ever Hamlet at the . Old Vic in 2004, one critic said: ‘This is the kind of evening of which . legends are made.’ Whishaw . then moved effortlessly between stage film and television, playing . aristocrat Sebastian Flyte in the remake of Brideshead Revisited and . starring in the BBC2 newsroom drama The Hour. Legend in the making: Whishaw pictured as Hamlet, with Imogen Stubbs as Gertrude, in a scene from the stage production directed by Trevor Nunn old the Old Vic which was hailed by the critics . Gritty: Whishaw in the play 'Mercury fur' at the Menier Chocolate Factory. He has accomplished the difficult trick of moving effortlessly between stage and screen . In an interview to promote Skyfall last year, he answered questions about his private life, saying: ‘For me, it’s important to keep a level of anonymity. As an actor, your job is to persuade people that you’re someone else. So if you’re constantly telling people about yourself, I think you’re shooting yourself in the foot.’ Rising star Mr Bradshaw composed the score for Campion’s  current BBC mini-series Top Of The Lake, starring Mad Men’s Elizabeth Moss, and for her short films The Lady Bug and The Water Diary. He was just 25 when he wrote the acclaimed score for Bright Star. At the time, Campion said he reminded her of Keats, adding: ‘We’re making this film about a young genius, so you’ve got to take a risk.’ Additional reporting: Alexander Woolley .","Ben Whishaw has entered civil partnership with composer Mark Bradshaw .

An American University department head has been arrested for allegedly breaking into a shopping mall near campus and setting a fire. Professor David Pitts, who chairs the Department of Public Administration and Policy, was charged with burglary and destruction of property, the Washington Post reported. He was being held on Friday pending a court appearance. Police in Washington, DC, were called to Foxhall Square Shopping Mall about 3am on Thursday for a report of a small fire near a parking attendant booth, WJLA reported. Pitts, 37, was arrested with matches, lighters, gloves and a newspaper, according to the station. He also allegedly pried open a door in the back of the building, which is about two blocks from campus, and burglarized it, WTTG reported. Police did not immediately disclose a motive for the incident. In a statement Friday, American University said Pitts has been placed on leave pending the result of an investigation by the Metropolitan Police Department. 'At this time, we are not aware of any safety threats to our community and we are working closely with MPD and AU Public Safety to continually assess the situation,' the statement said. His duties have been reassigned to other faculty members. Profesor Alison Jacknowitz will take over as the department chair while other lecturers assume Pitts' classes. Pitts has been a professor at American University since 2005, where his research focuses on diversity in public policy. American University's Department of Public Administration and Policy has suspended Pitts pending the result of a police investigation .","David Pitts, 37, is charged with burglary and destruction of property .

"It's long been the sophisticated woman's go-to fashion brand and this week Whistles is finally dipping a toe into the menswear market. The high street giant is rolling out its new men's collection in 24 shops round the country. But Whistles' first foray into male territory isn't all understated sophistication as one might expect. Amongst the clean-cut lines and smart separates are a few surprising numbers - most notably this £235 crew-neck sweater in fuchsia pink. This pink fluffy jumper (left) and bright blue stripey number (right) are amongst the more surprising elements of the new Whistles menswear collection . If you can't imagine your man in it, perhaps Whistles CEO Jane Shepherdson can persuade you. Shpherdson, who famously turned Top Shop into a mega brand before joining Whistles five years ago, told Louise France of The Saturday Times Magazine, 'The contrast of a fluffy pink jumper on a guy who looks quite hard works. It is really sexy.' She also added that it's all about 'looking cool, without looking like an a***hole.' Nevertheless, we can't imagine the brand's most famous fan, the Duchess of Cambridge, picking this one out for her man. Left: the fluffy pink number is also available as a fluffy blue number; Right: a casual look from the collection . Left: This biker jacket retails at £395; Right: ankle-flapper trousers and a backpack for the Whistles man . Other items that stand out amongst the otherwise elegant collection include a bright blue and black striped jumper and a camouflage print sweater. The more classic pieces, perhaps more likely to make Wills's wardrobe, include over-sized coats made from . the super-soft wool, simple leather biker jackets and a pair of wool jogging . trousers for that casual yet sophisticated look. The leather jackets have a £395 price tag, knitwear starts at £125 and casual separates can be found for under £100. 'At Whistles we value the power of understatement and believe that sharpness, quality and function are what really resonate today,' says Shepherdson of the new range. Left: the pink jumper in full fluffy glory; Right: a camouflage style sweater . Left: double-breasted coat, £395; Right: cashmere joggers for that casual yet elegant look . 'Menswear is built around a tightly edited core of familiar pieces, so making it feel relevant comes down to perfecting the details and subtly updating them,' she adds. 'If the simple things don’t look brilliant, how can you expect customers to fall for the more standout pieces?' Shepherdson revealed to the Saturday Times Magazine that at Whistles headquarters they created a 'dude board' where they'd pin pictures of their fantasy Whistles man. The brand describe the collection as 'both accessible and timeless' but will shoppers agree? The chosen icons included Ben Whishaw, until they decided he was too romantic, Ryan Gosling and Steve McQueen. To help understand what real men wanted from their clothing, Whistles ran focus groups. They discovered that small changing rooms and pockets that aren't big enough for smartphones are prime fashion faux-pas for men. But if they find a product they like, she also discovered they'll go back and buy more of exactly the same thing. After all their research, the brand has come up with a collection they describe as 'both accessible and timeless with an emphasis on newness guaranteed to keep men returning each season for exciting, wearable looks'. Will shoppers agree? Only time will tell. Let the shopping begin!

"There was widespread outrage among UEFA delegates at their meeting ahead of the FIFA Congress when the £16million outlay on Sepp Blatter’s vanity project film was discussed. The European representatives were aghast that Blatter should commit so much money — more than the annual turnover of most of UEFA’s national associations — to the FIFA history film United Passions, which was launched at the Cannes Film Festival last month. When Sports Agenda first revealed the sum Blatter had agreed to put into the project — against staff advice — Zurich claimed the true figure was far lower. Under fire: FIFA president Sepp blatter has been criticised by UEFA delegates . But financial director Markus Kattner, who rubber stamped the decision without the knowledge of a number of FIFA executive committee members, confirmed it was £16m this week. Kattner added that it was agreed at the 2009 Congress and included in FIFA’s 2010 financial report as a World Cup budget entry. But it is understandable that representatives from FIFA’s main decision-making committee knew nothing about this increasingly murky affair when their independent audit overseer Domenico Scala acknowledged it was a ‘single line entry’ without a purpose being specified. Spilling the beans: FIFA's finance administrator has confirmed the £16m sum used to make the film . FIFA will have to spend upwards of £1million on sending blood and urine samples from World Cup drugs tests to Switzerland after Rio’s poorly-equipped laboratory had its accreditation removed. World Anti-Doping Agency president Sir Craig Reedie will hold talks in Rio on Saturday to make sure preparations for a new lab for the 2016 Olympics are on course. Brazil Games chief Carlos Nuzman has invited Reedie to dinner, making sure it did not clash with the England game. Craig pointed out it would not be a problem as he is Scottish. Sepp Blatter has easily seen off all challengers to his FIFA presidency but UEFA chief Michel Platini is playing a canny game. Platini, whose FIFA election contention has shifted from definitely not to maybe, is wisely keeping options open to see how far Blatter’s reputation is tarnished from the Qatar scandal and the fall-out from Brazil’s shambolic World Cup preparation. Keeping his options open: Michel Platini with Blatter on Wednesday . Meanwhile, the criticism by David Gill, who rarely speaks in public, of Blatter’s ridiculous claims of racism against the British press is seen as a clear sign of him emerging as a candidate to be the next UEFA president. Both the BBC and ITV will have backdrops of Copacabana Beach and Sugarloaf Mountain from their purpose-built Rio broadcasting positions. The BBC facilities are bigger and no wonder, as they have sent 272 personnel to Brazil compared to ITV’s 123. Meanwhile, Sky Sports administrator Brendan Henry is considering bringing home two of Sky Sports News’s four crews in Brazil after FIFA barred non rights holders from pre-match access to World Cup stadiums. Delayed: England's journey from their hotel to the training base is becoming a nightmare . England’s journey from their hotel to their training base must be causing concern. First predicted to take 20 minutes, the eight-mile trip initially took 39 minutes, then 45 and on Wednesday lasted 55 minutes, with the extra delays blamed on protests on the Copacabana. There have been no signs of the priority lanes promised to the FA, while there is no chance of a rebellious Rio public observing the Olympic lanes that must be installed for the 2016 Games. A 2016 spokesman said lane details were under discussion. Things are no better in Sao Paulo, where FIFA executive committee members endured four-hour journeys from the airport and saw delegates bussed in at 7am yesterday to avoid the traffic chaos. Perhaps they may now be looking forward to the World Cup in Qatar, where all stadiums are in a 75-mile radius. Charm offensive: James Milner and team-mate Phil Jagielka have met fans . It may all go pear-shaped in Manaus on Friday, but the FA charm offensive has continued through the week in Miami and up to the eve of the team travelling to the Amazon city, with England players Phil Jagielka and James Milner staging a meet and greet with fans at a hotel near the team’s Royal Tulip base.","FIFA president sanctions massive outlay on vanity film project .

"An up-scale Indian hotel group is preparing to launch a package  for female tourists designed to ensure their safety while in Delhi in a bid to win back tourists after increased reports of sexual violence against women in the country. The Leela Hotel Group's New Delhi branch will soon be offering their Kamal (meaning  lotus) program for women who visit the city that starts with complimentary airport transfers with a trusted driver to interaction with female only staff while at the hotel and in public. The Leela Palace will host Kamal guests on a female only floor, with an all-female staff from the initial check-in, to concierge, butler and housekeeping staff. The hotel will boast security cameras in all public areas, and also implement security screenings. Safety: The Leela Palace in New Delhi's Kamal package will be designed to make female tourists feel safe . Private or all-female spa access will also be an option while the hotel will arrange female guides to help tourists around the cities many sights. The full extent of the program will be launched by Leela on September 15 but it was a matter of time before tourism operators took matters into their hands. Repeated incidents of violence against women in India has seen many foreigners shun the country, and the most high-profile and prolific offences have taken place in New Delhi. The Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative says one rape occurs every 30 minutes in India, a horrifying statistic that prompted strong words from India's recently elected prime minister Narendra Modi at his first Independence Day address. Women-only: Exclusively female staff will attend to Kamal guests, from concierge to housekeeping . 'When we hear about incidents of rape, our heads hang in shame,' Modi told the nation. Little has however been done beyond token gestures, and official bodies continue to warn women against travelling alone in India. The UK Foreign Office tells female tourists, including its own staff, to steer clear of public transport and to avoid taxis or auto-rickshaws after dark. Rather, women should order radio taxis through their hotel when it's more likely the driver as proper qualifications. Full package: Kamal will be available across all rooms from the basic to this deluxe Maharaja suit with a pool . 'British women have been the victims of sexual assault in Goa, Delhi, Bangalore and Rajasthan and women travellers often receive unwanted attention in the form of verbal and physical harassment by individuals or groups of men,' the Foreign Office warns. 'Serious sexual attacks involving Polish, German and Danish women travellers have been reported so far in 2014. Women travellers should exercise caution when travelling in India even if they are travelling in a group.'","Leela Hotel Group to launch program only for women in New Delhi .

"For when one layer simply isn't enough, Pillsbury has posted a recipe for a triple-decker pepperoni pizza cake. The preparation time for the decadent creation is an hour and ten minutes. The recipe, which makes six servings, requires just five ingredients: Pillsbury refrigerated classic pizza crust, Muir Glen organic pizza sauce, shredded mozzarella cheese, pepperoni and butter. Deep dish: Pillsbury has posted a recipe for a decadent multi-layered pepperoni pizza cake . A circular cake pan with tall sides is also required. After cutting the dough into five circles the size of the pan, you can begin adding each layer of meat and cheese before baking the cake for 20 to 25 minutes. Shawn Syphus, the recipe's author, inists that it's 'super easy' to make, advising: 'Don’t push this recipe off as too difficult, or too time consuming.' While no nutritional information is listed for the pizza cake, Pillsbury's pizza crust is 960 calories per can, according to the brand's website. MailOnline used MyFitnessPal to add up the ingredients' calories, and estimated that the entire pizza cake contains 3,818 calories, while there are 636 in each slice. Layer by layer: First you cut the dough into five circles the size and add one to the bottom of a tall circular pan . The meaty part: Then you keep adding layers of dough, pepperoni and cheese until reaching the top of the pan . However, Pillsbury isn't the first to come up with the mouth-watering concept. The food site So Good Blog published a very similar recipe back in April. In April, Canadian chain Boston Pizza asked customers to vote in an online poll on whether to add pizza cake to its summer menu. The multi-layered treat won first place in the restaurants Pizza Game Changers campaign. Other contenders included a box of tiny pizza mints, a gas-powered pizza cutter, pizza clippers, pizza car fresheners, a shirt with a triangle-shaped pocket for holding a slice of pizza and a pizza beardkin – a beard-shaped napkin with a hole for one’s mouth that allows for mess-free pizza eating.","MailOnline estimates that the entire pizza cake has 3,818 calories, and each serving contains 636 calories ."
"Andy Murray is all but qualified for next month’s season-end finale in London, dredging up another supreme effort on Sunday to almost cement his place in the illustrious eight-man field. The 27 year-old Scot, who at the US Open expressed indifference about ‘overplaying’ to fight his way to the O2 Arena, strained every sinew in saving five match points and win the Valencia Open with a 3-6, 7-6, 7-6, victory over world No 16 Tommy Robredo. The Spaniard jokingly gave him a two fingered salute as they collapsed upon each other at the net after another epic battle. Last month Murray also saved five match points against him in the Shenzen Open final, which was to kick off a remarkable five-week run that will carry him all the way to the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals. Andy Murray celebrates his Valencia Open victory by spraying champagne inside the Agora building . Murray falls back onto the court as he clinches a gruelling three-set victory against Tommy Robredo . Murray plays a forehand as he fights back from a set down and saves five match points in the final . Andy Murray can seal qualification for the ATP World Tour Finals by reaching the quarter-finals of this week's Paris Masters. Even if he was to lose his opening match, all of the following would have to happen for him to miss out on the season-ending finale in London: . Murray will drag his battered frame to the Paris Masters this week but the hard work is surely done with this third title in 31 days, which has seen him win 17 out of 19 matches and revive a year that had fallen short of his usual standards. At Flushing Meadows he pledged not to overdo it in trying to make the prestigious London event which offers huge ranking points and prize money, but has had a strange way of showing it ever since. The result has been a surge up to the fifth qualifying place, and even if he was to lose his opening match in Paris – where he has a bye into the second round - there would need to be an extraordinary confluence of results to keep him out. The arithmetic is infernal, but it will take stellar Paris performances from Tomas Berdych, David Ferrer, Milos Raonic and Grigor Dimitrov to pull off the mathematical miracle required. Murray missed the whole of the late season twelve months ago after undergoing back surgery and had not won a tournament prior to China but it is now possible he will end the season back in the top four. Murray poses for the cameras with his trophy as he edges closer to qualifying for the ATP World Tour Finals .

David Ferrer (ESP) - 3,865 . -------------------- . 10. Milos Raonic (CAN) - 3,840 . 11. Grigor Dimitrov (BUL) - 3,565 . *Cilic qualifies as US Open champion . The question is how much he will have left in the tank for the last two significant events of the year after pulling himself around Asia and then making unscheduled entries into Vienna and Valencia, which he won as part of a nine-match winning streak. Above him the wider intrigue will surround Roger Federer and his attempts to join Serena Williams – who beat Simona Halep to win the WTA year-end finale in Singapore on Sunday – as the season’s official number one player at the ripe old age of 33. Federer, who won the ATP event in Basle on Sunday by beating David Goffin 6-2 6-2, will be tired but not as much as Murray, who is now due to compete for his sixth week in succession. One of the last players you would wish to meet under the circumstances is Robredo, who is like his fellow Spanish 32 year-old Ferrer in having remarkable stamina to cover enormous mileage. Murray has beaten them both in his three recent finals and needed to overcome them both this weekend, and it was amazing his legs could take the strain. At times in the three hour and 20 minute final he looked on the verge of keeling over and lost his temper several times, with even the indefatigable Robredo showing signs of cramping as they went down the stretch again. While Murray’s fighting spirit will be the abiding memory of one of the tennis year’s best contests the fact is that he could have wrapped it up in straight sets. He was a little tentative on his six break points in the first set and should have gone a double break up for 5-2 in the second. Robredo had two match points before Murray came through 9-7 in the subsequent tiebreak. In the second tiebreak Robredo got to 6-5 and pushed Murray way into the corner, but he somehow managed to keep the rally going to stay alive before saving two more, and then reeling off three winning combinations from 7-8 down. That brings 500 points – double the haul from Shenzhen or Vienna – and it should mean the home crowd will get to see this remarkable competitor by the Thames early next month. Robredo looks fired up as he pushes Murray all the way in a tight three-set Valencia Open final . A general view of the stunning Agora building as Murray takes on Robredo for the title in Valencia . It was a heartbreaking defeat for Spaniard Tommy Robredo who failed to capitalise on five match points against Andy Murray in front of his home fans. It was the second time in a month that the British No 1 saved five match points against Robredo, the last time being in the final of the Shenzhen Open on September 28.

"Citing a string of ethical lapses by senior military officers, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has asked the Joint Chiefs of Staff to review ethics training and to brainstorm on ways to steer officers away from trouble. The move is a reflection of the depth of concern triggered by a series of misconduct cases in a military that prides itself on integrity and honor but has suffered an unusual number of stumbles after a decade of war. In a memo to General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Panetta made no explicit reference to the David Petraeus sex scandal, which also has ensnared the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, General John Allen - but nonetheless ordered the review. Re-Training: U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta has ordered an ethics review for high level U.S. military commanders following a series of embarrassing scandals this year . Panetta's press secretary, George Little, said the memo was the product of internal Pentagon discussions that began before Petraeus announced he was resigning as CIA director because of an extramarital affair. 'I will emphasize very strongly that the secretary was going to embark on this course long before the matters that have come to light over the past week,' Little said. He added that Panetta believes the vast majority of senior military officers serve with distinction and in accordance with ethical standards. Panetta mentioned no specific cases of officer misconduct but noted in his memo to Dempsey that, 'as has happened recently, when lapses occur, they have the potential to erode public confidence in our leadership and in our system for the enforcement of our high ethical standards. 'Worse, they can be detrimental to the execution of our mission to defend the American people.' US Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta and Thai Minister of Defense Sukampol Suwannathat  shake hands after signing the 2012 Joint Vision Statement for the Thai - US Defense Alliance today (right) A number of senior officers have faced disciplinary action this year for misconduct, including Gen. William 'Kip' Ward, who was reduced in rank from four stars to three this week after investigators determined that he had misused government funds for lavish spending while commanding U.S. Africa Command. Brigadier General Jeffrey A. Sinclair is waiting on a potential court martial after being accused of 26 violations of military law including forcible sodomy, wrongful sexual conduct, possessing pornography while deployed and conduct unbecoming of an officer. The offences allegedly occurred in Germany and the Middle East and in May, Sinclair was removed from his role as deputy commander for support in Afghanistan. And in November, Navy Commander Joseph E. Darlak and officers of the frigate USS Vandegrift were relieved of duty after a drunken port visit to Vladivostok, Russia. An internal investigation found that Darlak has exhibited, 'poor leadership and failure to ensure the proper conduct of his wardroom officers' during the three day visit. Panetta told Dempsey to work with the chiefs of the Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps to review ethics training for officers to determine whether they are adequate, and to provide views on 'how to better foster a culture of value-based decision-making and stewardship' among senior officers and their staffs. That is another way of saying Panetta wants a game plan for ending the string of bad behavior. Caught in the Act: A combination photo shows CIA Director David Petraeus (left) and U.S. Marine Corps Lt. Gen. John Allen . According to sources who have worked first hand with senior U.S. military figures, a culture has developed in which some believe they are above the law. 'With the senior guys and the flag officers, this is like the new royalty,' said Frank Wuco, speaking to NBC News. 'We treat them like kings and princes. These general officers in the military, at a certain point, become untouchable. 'In many cases, they get their own airplanes, their own helicopters. 'When they walk into a room, everybody comes to attention. In the case of some of them, people are very afraid to speak up or to disagree. 'Being separated from real life all the time in that way probably leaves them vulnerable.' He said the initial results of the chiefs' review, along with their recommendations, should be ready in time for Panetta to report to President Barack Obama by Dec. 1. The text of the Panetta memo, which he signed on Wednesday, was provided Thursday to reporters traveling with the Pentagon chief, who was in Bangkok for talks with senior Thai government officials in advance of Obama's visit here this weekend. 'Beyond mere compliance with the rules, I also expect senior officers and civilian executives to exercise sound judgment in their stewardship of government resources and in their personal conduct,' Panetta said. 'An action may be legally permissible but neither advisable nor wise.' Affair: Almost a week ago David Petraeus was exposed for having had an extra-marital affair with his biographer Paula Broadwell . The scandal that has gripped Washington emerged when Jill Kelley (left) received threatening emails from Paula Broadwell and asked FBI Agent Frederick Humphries (right) to investigate . Panetta said he intends to raise these issues in a meeting next month with all of the military service chiefs, the services' civilian leaders and the generals and admirals who lead major commands like U.S. Central Command. 'Ultimately, when their failure becomes public, they may get punished. Bottom line: Today being a general is like being a tenured professor. You can do a lousy job and keep it, but if you embarrass the institution with moral lapses, you will get bounced,' said Thomas Ricks, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. Dempsey said Thursday that he has been concerned for many months about an apparent slip in ethical standards within the military — both in the officer corps and in the enlisted ranks. In an interview with the Pentagon's internal news service, American Forces Press Service, Dempsey said he noticed disturbing trends last spring. 'In response to these issues I have communicated through a memorandum to every four-star in every service,' Dempsey said. 'I expressed my concern and encouraged their interest and their active involvement in helping us to understand what really is going on and what's not.' Indeed, Frank Wuco made the point that infidelity in the U.S. military is nothing new for its highest ranking officers.

Relieved: Former commander of the U.S. Africa Command General William Ward addresses a news conference in Algiers November 25, 2009 . Dwight D. Eisenhower and General George S. Patten were known to have had affairs while commanding forces in Europe during World War Two, but this was never made public in the manner of the Petraeus scandal. 'We’re in a different time now,' said Robert O. Kirkland, a military . historian who teaches at the University of Southern California. 'Maybe some things in the past were overlooked,' said Kirkland. 'They’re now enforced.' Ethics issues associated with the Petraeus and Allen matters were raised during Panetta's joint news conference Thursday with his Thai counterpart, Sukampol Suwannathat. The two spoke to reporters after signing an update to a 1962 U.S.-Thai statement framing the security relationship. The United States and Thailand are treaty allies — a relationship that Washington sees as a cornerstone of its security interests in Asia. Panetta said he knows of no other senior U.S. military officers being linked to the Petraeus investigation, and he said he retains 'tremendous confidence' in Allen. 'I am not aware of any others that could be involved in this issue at the present time,' he said, adding that he wanted the American public to understand that the vast majority of military officers serve ethically. Different Era: General Dwight Eisenhower (left) is acknowledged to have had an extra-marital affair while serving in World War Two as is General George S. Patton (right) 'One thing I do demand,' he said, 'is that those who seek to protect this country operate by the highest ethical standards.' Panetta declined to describe the nature of the emails and other correspondence between Allen and Florida socialite Jill Kelley, which others have called flirtatious and potentially problematic for the Marine four-star general. Asked whether any of those emails are sexually explicit, Panetta said, 'What I don't want to do is to try to characterize those communications because I don't want to do anything' to limit the ability of the Pentagon inspector general to conduct an objective review of the Allen matter. The Defense Secretary ordered the investigation Monday after the FBI referred the matter to the Pentagon's top lawyer. Allen issued a statement through his lawyer saying he is committed to cooperating fully with the investigation. Panetta also told reporters he could not rule out the possibility that the Taliban in Afghanistan would try to use Petraeus' admission of an extramarital affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell, for propaganda purposes. Petraeus, who resigned Friday from his post as CIA director, was Allen's predecessor as top commander in Afghanistan, leaving in summer 2011. Panetta is the first U.S. defense secretary to visit Thailand since 2008.

It pictures her . about to tuck into a king prawn cake to celebrate her first birthday . last August. Lagerfeld is so enamoured of the animal that her eyes are . said to have been the inspiration for a cornflower-blue couture . collection for Chanel, the fashion house for which he is head designer. When Lagerfeld is not at home the . maids, apparently named Francoise and Marjorie,  write down everything . she does in little books so he can catch up on it later.

"Manchester United are playing a game of cat and mouse with Juventus over Chilean midfielder Arturo Vidal. The word from Manchester on Friday was that the club were no longer interested in Vidal. But 24 hours later there were suggestions in Italy that United raised an earlier bid of £30million to £35m. VIDEO Scroll down to watch transfer targets Vidal and Cleverley showing their quality . Time running out: Manchester United must move quick if they want to sign Arturo Vidal (right) The situation highlights how United have been left to pay over the odds this summer to lure top-class players given they are out of the Champions League and how Louis van Gaal’s ability to make firm recommendations was hindered by his involvement as Holland coach at the World Cup. United also jetted off on a pre-season tour to America as soon as he took over. But United do believe they have secured the services of versatile Dutch defender Daley Blind for £14m. The completion of the transfer of Marcos Rojo, though, is still in the balance over an issue with his visa and the complete severance of his third party status at Sporting Lisbon. Danny Welbeck is set to be at the centre of the most hectic activity on deadline day. Options: Danny Welbeck has been linked with several of United's Premier League rivals during this window . As revealed by Football Grapevine last week, Welbeck is surplus to requirements at Old Trafford. The player does not want to leave but will accept he has to move on for the sake of his career. Tottenham appear to head the queue and while Arsenal have been on alert, manager Arsene Wenger said on Friday that he thinks he has enough strikers. Spurs would be prepared to pay at least £15m for Welbeck and Everton are still in the mix but the player may prefer to go on loan, giving himself the chance to revive his United career down the line. Hull City are set to challenge Aston Villa for Tom Cleverley, another United cast-off, as the transfer deadline turns into its usual last-minute scramble. Clearout: Midfielder Tom Cleverley (left) is another playing heading for the Manchester United exit door . Andros Townsend could be on his way out of Tottenham with Queens Park Rangers set to make a bid. Even though Townsend has won his way back into the England set-up he will become surplus to requirements at Spurs, especially if the club complete the signing of Southampton’s Morgan Schneiderlin. Mon: It’s early doors but the manner in which Manchester City beat Liverpool suggest they are going to take some stopping to retain their title. I suspect Chelsea will provide the main sustained challenge. Tue: Frank Lampard quits international football as predicted a couple of months ago in this column. In a few months, those who, bizarrely, ridiculed him over the course of his 106-cap England career, will start to realise how good he actually was. Weds: Manchester United finally unveil Angel di Maria having spent a British record £59.7m to lure him from Real Madrid - a club he did not want to leave. Is it a signing to significantly improve United as an attacking force when actually bolstering the defence is the priority? Or is it to boost shirt sales and enhance sponsor deals in South America? Thurs: Roy Hodgson hails surprise England call up Jack Colback as the 'Ginger Pirlo'. No pressure then. Fri: FA general secretary Alex Horne says 'we have go to rebuild some trust with supporters' in view of the fact that Wembley is set to he half full for the Norway friendly on Wednesday. Trust? More like a decent team with an inspiring manager playing with some flair, urgency and passion, plus not being ripped off by high prices for tickets, food, drink, programmes, parking etc. Then again maybe Horne is right to use the word trust. When fans are taken for a ride on and off the pitch they are bound to lose trust. Libero . Frank Lampard's retirement from international football saw much debate about why England’s so called 'golden generation' ended up with the wooden spoon. Time and again. Bad management by the ridiculous Sven Goran Eriksson in particular as well as out-of-his-depth Steve McClaren and antique collector Fabio Capello are obvious reasons. Predecessor to that trio Kevin Keegan was pilloried but I have a suspicion he would have got more out of the talented wave of players that emerged at the turn of the millennium. I am convinced Glenn Hoddle would have, had he not been rushed out of office. A few months ago I was in Hoddle’s company and we touched on what might have been post France 98. He felt the future was bright given the players he had under his belt and those on the horizon and in general would have adopted a 3-5-2 system. A team like this could then have emerged by 2002: David James, Sol Campbell, Rio Ferdinand, John Terry, David Beckham, Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard, Paul Scholes, Ashley Cole, Robbie Fowler, Michael Owen. With a young and sharp Wayne Rooney to emerge and the likes of Gary Neville, Joe Cole, Michael Carrick and Jermain Defoe around to bolster the above team then by 2004 or 2006 the so-called 'golden generation' could have lifted big silverware. And the future now under an increasingly hapless Roy Hodgson? As it stands it would seem more like a Plastic Generation. All over: Frank Lampard called time on his England career after winning 106 caps . Bowing out: Lampard played his final game for England - the World Cup draw with Costa Rica . I am hearing . West Ham's hierarchy are poised to use the international break to decide on Sam Allardyce's future following a 3-1 home defeat by Southampton. I understand co-owner David Sullivan is at breaking point and is beginning to think 'enough is enough'. Tony Pulis ,David Moyes and Gus Poyet are top of a long list. Under pressure: Sam Allardyce watched his West Ham side lose on their own patch to Southampton . I am also hearing . That Felix Magath is on his way out of Fulham - and soon. Chris Hughton and Alan Curbishley are two leading contenders to take over. Contenders: Chris Hughton (left) and Alan Curbishley have been linked with taking over the reins at Fulham . Back Heel . Last week Back Heel recalled England’s infamous 2-1 defeat by Norway after which the commentator Bjorge Lillelien went on a wonderful victory rant. Clearer in the minds of many will be the 2-0 loss to Norway in Oslo in June 1993. It was one of the games immortalised on the Impossible Job documentary about Graham Taylor’s reign aka Do I No Like That. Taylor is on the bench with yes-man Phil Neal and Lawrie McMenemy in Oslo and the dialogue could have been scripted by Monty Python. The Norway sequence (at 29.20 of the clip below) begins poignantly with a Taylor press conference the day before the game when he talks openly, but euphemistically, for the first time about Paul Gascoigne’s 'refuelling' habits. It has been painful to see pictures over the past week as to where those 'refuelling' habits have led Gazza. Watch the footage below…it’s likely to be more entertaining than Wednesday’s friendly against Norway at Wembley. BTW . It’s easy to castigate uber-rich players for not giving fig about punters or just doing PR charity stunts but Mark Bright, the former Crystal Palace and Sheffield Wednesday striker now pundit, pointed me in the direction of Everton striker Steven Naismith. The Scotland international bought four tickets for the Chelsea game and has given them to some unemployed locals. I gather he pays for Christmas parties for the homeless in Liverpool and Glasgow. Top bloke. Gesture: Steven Naismith has bought Everton tickets for unemployed people in Liverpool . Y Factor . Wayne Rooney’s 'appointment' as England captain raises the obvious question - why do we actually need to appoint a captain anymore? Back in the day when the England manager had a very small backroom staff the skipper became an extension of the boss with several 'managerial duties' to perform . Alf Ramsey saw Bobby Moore as his voice on the pitch, while off it Moore would often act as a conduit between the dressing room and the manager. Moore was also the head of PR before there was even a press officer let alone spin doctors around. Over to you, Wayne: Rooney takes the England armband following Steven Gerrard's retirement . Many captains since took on the mantle. But the meaning of the role has dwindled given the layers of the backroom staff and entourage. It’s good for the player of course. He stands to get even more sponsor endorsements. But for the team? Roy Hodgson says making Rooney captain doesn’t mean he is 'undroppable'. Natural born leader: Bobby Moore was the England captain when the Three Lions ruled the world in 1966 . Let's see. Why not in future just give the captain’s armband to the player who has the most caps at the start of the game? As it stands that is Rooney. But from now on the position should be a symbol of seniority. Not some sort of sinecure. I-Bet . Manchester City have got the toughest group of the four English clubs in the Champions League but I think they can get through it. So do most of the bookies who put them ahead of Arsenal and Liverpool to go all the way. It’s worth then taking a punt on City at this stage at 14-1 with Coral to lift the trophy with Chelsea half that price. But given the final is in Berlin and German football is on a crest of a wave, Bayern Munich at 5-1 looks a decent shout. Real Madrid are 10-3 favourites. Stop Press .

"The Australian who gave up her quest to swim from Cuba to Florida because of painful jellyfish stings said Thursday that she will not make another attempt. Chloe McCardel said that she had picked June because the jellyfish danger was supposed to be low. But about 11 hours and 14 miles into her expected 60-hour, 110-mile journey, she found herself in a swarm. 'I had one coming out of my mouth. I was pulling it, this tentacle out of my mouth, but I don't remember this moment. My kayaker told me that I was doing this, 'cause I have no recollection. I'm not coming back. That's it,' she said. Scroll down for video . Lashes: McCardel, left, shows jellyfish stings to a news videographer in Key West, Florida on June 13, 2013 . Painful: Chloe McCardel shows reporters jellyfish stings on her arm as she addresses a news conference in Key West, Florida 13 June 2013 . The 28-year-old from Melbourne became the latest endurance athlete undone by the strong currents and fierce jellyfish of the Florida Straits on Wednesday night, abandoning her attempt to become the first person to swim across nonstop without a shark cage. The jellyfish caught her by surprise. 'I got smashed with them coming from every direction,' she said. 'I would not have gone to all this trouble if I had known they would be out in such numbers in June.' She was pulled out of the water and taken by one of her support vessels to Key West, where she was resting at a hotel Thursday. She said the trip back to land was excruciating. 'It was two and a half hours of the worst pain, continuously, every second, of my whole entire life. It's like fireballs in every fiber,' she said. It was the fifth failure involving three women who have tried to make the marathon swim the past three summers. Jellyfish stings and strong currents have been the main impediments. Ouch: Australian long-distance swimmer Chloe McCardel shows jellyfish stings after giving up her quest to become the first person to swim from Cuba to Florida without a shark cage . Not coming back: Australian long-distance swimmer Chloe McCardel vowed to never return to the jellyfish-infested waters of Cuba . Tears: McCardel wipes a tear as she addresses reporters after her failed swim . Diana Nyad tweeted her commiseration. The endurance athlete has failed three times trying to make the same crossing and says she'd like to take another shot this summer. 'It's a tough night for Chloe McCardel, a superior swimmer and an exemplary spirit,' Nyad wrote. Endurance swimmer Penny Palfrey has also tried and failed to make the swim. Australian Susie Maroney successfully made the crossing in 1997, but she did it with the benefit of a shark cage. McCardel had twice made a double crossing of the English Channel, but the most time she had spent in the water continuously was 25 hours. She attempted her Cuba to Florida swim under English Channel Marathon rules, which meant she could not touch her support boat or hold on to anything. She also wasn't allowed to wear a full-body wetsuit, which would have helped protect against jellyfish. McCardel and her team spent nine and a half months planning the trip and studying others' attempts. Box jellyfish: Experts believe the Australian was attacked by a box jellyfish, like that pictured, which are common in the Florida Straits . Off to a good start: McCardel waves to spectators as she begins her swim to Florida from the waters off Havana, Cuba, on Wednesday, June 12, 2013 but she abandoned her attempt 11 hours later . Australian swimmer Chloe McCardel had to abandon her plan to swim from Cuba to Florida after 11 hours due to a 'debilitating' jelly fish sting . McCardel had expected to spend about 60 hours in the sea before reaching the Florida Keys, a little more than 100 miles to the northeast . The repeated failures raise the . question of whether the Cuba-to-Florida swim without a cage is even . doable as a 2.5 day swim is stretching the physical limits of even elite . endurance athletes. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, . the longest open water swim without flippers was 139.8 miles by Croatian . Veljko Rogosic, who swam between two Italian cities on the Adriatic Sea . from Aug. 29 to 31, 2006. Dr. Clifton Page, a sports medicine specialist at the University of Miami . Miller School of Medicine, said he thinks the Cuba-to-Florida swim can . be done, although there are several physical obstacles to overcome. He . has advised Nyad on her swims. One . obstacle is hypothermia. While the water is more than 80 degrees in . late spring and summer, it is still well below the body's normal . temperature of 98 degrees and causes it to slowly drop. There . is also malnutrition. No matter how often the swimmer stops to eat, she . will never ingest enough calories to make up for those expended . swimming, he said. After a while, that causes the muscles to start . breaking down. Preparing: Australian swimmer Chloe McCardel adjusts her earplugs as her husband applies grease around the edges of her suit to prevent chafing . This is the moment McCardel jumped into the water at Hemingway Marina to start her swim to Florida from Havana, Cuba . Then there is dehydration, he said. Even though swimmers don't feel it, they sweat just like any other . athlete, while the saltwater acts like a wick, drawing even more water . out of the body. Finally, there is sleep deprivation -- exercising that . hard for days without sleep can result in hallucinations. 'The variable is the jellyfish,' Page . said. He said their bites are very painful and potentially fatal if not . treated. 'Chloe would have gotten a lot further into her swim if she . hadn't been bit.' Adding to the swimmer's strain are . the Florida Strait's currents. Villy Kourafalou, a University of Miami . oceanography professor, said that the swim from Cuba to the Keys 'is . very challenging as the currents are not only very strong but also . extremely variable.' But, she said, modern computer models . that utilize information from satellites, buoys and ships allow the . swimmer's support team to better predict the currents and help the . members decide the best time to start the swim, the best route to take . and then make adjustments along the way. McCardel puts on her goggles as she prepares to jump into the water and start her swim to Florida from Havana, Cuba .

"Nearly half of Britain’s top-secret military drones deployed in Afghanistan have crashed – many because of pilot error. The alarming loss rate has raised concerns about British forces’ capability to wage a successful war against the Taliban. The Mail on Sunday has discovered that since drones were fully deployed in Afghanistan in 2007, 12 have been lost, costing the British taxpayer more than £30 million. Top secret: An RAF Reaper Drone . A Ministry of Defence report into the growing crisis has called for immediate changes to the selection and training of drone pilots and their supervisors. Last night, MPs described the losses as very worrying. Kim Howells, former chairman of the Commons Intelligence and Security Committee, said: ‘It’s astonishing that so many drones have crashed in just five years. If you can’t fly them properly, you really are in trouble. They cost a fortune and we have got to keep them in the air.’ The crashes mean Britain has been left with 14 operational full-size drones. Five are American-made Reaper UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), which carry 500 lb bombs and Hellfire missiles for strikes on insurgents, and nine are Israeli Hermes models, used for reconnaissance and surveillance. The accidents have claimed one Reaper drone – worth an estimated £10 million – and 11 smaller Hermes drones, which cost £2 million each. The Government has spent roughly £2 billion on drones since 2007, but nearly half of that has been allocated to the Watchkeeper drone that was originally scheduled to be operational by June 2010 but which has yet to enter service. At the controls: A crewman guides a Reaper drone in Afghanistan . Concerns were raised in an investigation by the Military Aviation Authority after the crash of a Hermes 450 unmanned aircraft at Camp Bastion, the main British base in Afghanistan, last year. The report makes it clear that warnings from a previous crash were largely ignored. Investigators found that although the drone had suffered a mechanical failure, a range of training and piloting factors, including the crew lacking sleep in the weeks leading up to the crash, played a part. It is understood that the majority of the crashes occurred on landing and take-off. One former air controller who worked with drones in Afghanistan until 2010 told The Mail on Sunday: ‘These crashes were kept quiet from us but they don’t surprise me. The Hermes was a very difficult, unresponsive platform.’ Drones are controlled by personnel from the Royal Air Force and Royal Artillery, either from Afghanistan itself or on the Greek island of Crete. Shadow defence spokesman Kevan Jones said: ‘There needs to be more training, investment in training and technology.’ An MoD spokesman said: ‘A service report into a crash that occurred in Afghanistan in 2011 concluded that engine failure was to blame. The MoD is implementing all of the recommendations, and lessons learnt from this incident are being incorporated into training for all personnel who operate Hermes 450.’","A Ministry of Defence report into the growing crisis has called for immediate changes to the selection and training of drone pilots .

"The method used to decide whether or not the NHS will fund a drug is should be scrapped, according to a new study. The formula used by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) assesses a drug by looking at how much a year's worth of treatment costs compared with the benefits the patient gains in life expectancy and improved health. But researchers, funded by the European Commission, found the system currently used by the UK drugs watchdog is deeply 'flawed'. Flawed? Decisions not to fund drugs such as Herceptin for early breast cancer were reversed after causing huge controversy . The method is known as quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and has been used as a template by other countries such as Canada. However, the decisions are often controversial as they affect whether patients suffering illnesses such as cancer can receive potentially life-altering treatments. NICE generally turns down treatments that cost more than £20,000 per QUALY as not cost-effective, which often rules out new revolutionary drugs. Now a team of researchers, led by French doctor Ariel Beresniak, have called for it to be scrapped as it produces the 'wrong results.' 'This isn't a scientific way to classify and prioritise the drugs - mathematically, it's flawed,' Dr Beresniak told the BBC. 'NICE has made negative recommendations about many major innovative drugs, based only on arbitrary incremental cost per QALY.' The researchers added that the method doesn't reflect different views on illness and disability. Dr Beresniak believes the system used by NICE to decide whether to fund drugs produces the 'wrong results' They found these could vary widely after surveying 1,300 European respondents, including 301 in the UK. For instance while 71 per cent of respondents would prefer to live 15 years in a wheelchair than die after ten or five years in a wheelchair, the remaining 29 per cent would rather die earlier. The team suggested that another approach should be considered, perhaps that looked at how many relapses a drug might prevent or how many cases of remission it could provide. The findings were welcomed by a number of charities. James Whale, Chairman of The James Whale Fund For Kidney Cancer said: 'This new research funded by the European Commission underlines what we have been saying about the NICE system of cost of ‘treatment against effect on health and life expectancy’ all along, it is simply incorrect. NICE have to scrap these guidelines now and start giving hope to all cancer patients and put a stop to their ‘flawed’ methodology without fail.' However, a number of British experts have defended the system, saying difficult decisions needed to be made working with a limited budget. Prof David Spiegelhalter, Winton Professor of The Public Understanding of Risk, University of Cambridge, said: 'These type of criticisms are not new and do not invalidate what is done by NICE. 'Of course the QALY approach is not perfect, but some mechanism is needed to provide consistent comparisons across different medical interventions, based on aggregate benefit and cost.  Otherwise the money could go to those with the most appealing emotional argument.' Prof John Cairns, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of the NICE Appraisal Committee for 10 years, said: 'We . need to be able to compare what we gain by spending in one area with what we . lose by not spending in another area. 'This new project’s suggested . approach of using measures of outcome specific to particular diseases will not . allow us to do that. 'QALYs are certainly not . perfect and we should be looking for better ways of informing decision making . but getting rid of an imperfect system without replacing it with a better one . is not the way forward.' A NICE spokesperson said: 'When we want to find out whether a new treatment provides more for patients than current practice, and whether any improvement in quality or length of life justifies the price the NHS is asked to pay for it, we need to use a measure that can be applied fairly across all diseases and conditions. The QALY is the best measure anyone has yet devised to enable us to do this. 'Economists will argue about the precision of the QALY methods and it’s not perfect. But it’s based on solid research and uses a way of measuring how quality of life changes when using different treatments, which is the best we have available. 'It’s developing and improving all the time and the criticisms in this, rather limited study haven’t shaken our confidence in its value to NICE in helping make decisions on the best way to use new and sometimes very expensive drugs and other health technologies.'","Drugs rationing body NICE weighs cost of treatment against effect on health and life expectancy .

"Workers churning out toys of Olympic mascots Wenlock and Mandeville are being paid just £6 a day to toil in sweatshop conditions, a report claimed today. Plastic figures of the London 2012 mascots - which are sold for up to £10 - are mass-produced by factory workers in China who are forced to do 120 hours' overtime a month. Workers allegedly being exposed to hazardous conditions and being docked half a day's pay for being five minutes late were some of the other 'rampant rights violations' apparently witnessed at the factory in Guangdong province where the mascots are made. Factory-produced: Plastic Wenlock and Mandeville toys, similar to these cuddly mascots made in Dafeng city, China, are being mass-produced by workers doing illegal amounts of overtime on miniscule daily pay . Activists who interviewed workers at the Xinda facility in Guangdong said employees worked six day weeks of up to 12 hours a day - three times the legal overtime allowed under Chinese labour laws. At another factory in Shenzhen city, which also produces plastic toys for Locog, workers would regularly finish similarly long shifts at midnight, before starting again at 8am the next day. The employees would also be fined half a day's salary if they were five minutes late to work. Hard labour: An investigation earlier this year claimed that workers at Yancheng Rainbow Arts & Crafts in Dafeng city worked 11.5 hour days for 26p . Hong Kong workers' rights group Sacom (Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehaviour) also claimed workers would be fined one-and-a-half days salary if they caused a 'work stoppage' by being more than five minutes late. Two work stoppages would see them docked six days salary, according to the report. Locog had issued a sustainable and ethical sourcing code in 2008, which Sacom says is 'inadequate'. The Sacom report highlighted excessive overtime, meager wages and poor worker safety in the two factories. It . said: 'The rampant rights violations reveal that Locog codes are really . no more than lip service with no commitment to the enforcement of . labour rights standards. 'The . IOC should establish a policy and action plan for future Olympic . Games... adopt a code of conduct for the suppliers which should include . terms like living wages, freedom of association and the right to . remedy.' Earlier this year . similar complaints had been made about another Chinese factory producing . Wenlock and Mandeville toys for the Games. A . Chinese factory making toys for Shropshire-based Golden Bear was said . to be breaching workers rights by making them labour for 11.5 hours a . day for as little as 26p an hour. Wenlock and Mandeville were revealed as the official London 2012 mascots in May 2010 . After the latest revelations, Locog responded by claiming it has independently reviewed the two factories, and claimed 'no issues were found'. A spokesperson told the Guardian: 'Regarding the Shiwei factory, Locog has undertaken a full review of Golden Bear's [official supplier of Olympic merchandise for London 2012] ethical trade management systems. 'Golden Bear has now fully committed to implementing all recommendations of that review and is in process of reviewing all factories in its supply chain.'","Factories producing plastic toys in Guangdong and Shenzhen city commit 'rampant rights violations' against workers .

"Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin clashed  head-on yesterday over the crisis in Ukraine. The US president said his Russian counterpart was ‘not fooling anybody’ when he denied sending his troops into the Crimea. Despite clear evidence they were Russian, Mr Putin claims soldiers seen in the peninsula are ‘local forces of self defence’. He said he was not planning on war but . would use ‘all measures’ to protect citizens following an . ‘unconstitutional coup’ in Kiev. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Putin, left, claims soldiers seen in the peninsula are 'local forces of self defence' while the US president said his Russian counterpart was 'not fooling anybody' by denying they were Russian troops . Speaking for the first time since Russian troops effectively took control of the Crimean peninsula, Putin said if 'anarchy' erupts elsewhere in eastern Ukraine, Moscow would have no hesitation in responding . Ousted president Viktor Yanukovych had appealed for help to protect Russian speakers in Ukraine, he added. Mr Obama ridiculed the claims and insisted Moscow had violated international law. ‘President Putin seems to have a different set of lawyers making a different set of interpretations – but I don’t think that’s fooling anybody,’ he said. His secretary of state John Kerry also condemned Russia’s ‘aggression’. On another day of drama: . Looking relaxed in front of reporters, Mr Putin spoke shortly after ordering thousands of Russian troops on an exercise near the Ukrainian border to return to barracks. Vladimir Putin also cautioned the international community about the potential consequences of any sanctions - saying 'in our modern world everybody depends on everybody' He cautioned the international community about the potential consequences of any sanctions, saying: ‘In our modern world, everybody depends on everybody. It is possible to harm each other but it will be a mutual harm.’ There were more reports yesterday of Ukrainian troops in Crimea defecting to Russia and Mr Putin said: ‘Ukraine is not only our closest neighbour but it is our fraternal republic, our fraternal neighbour and our armed forces are brothers in arms, friends. ‘They know each other personally and I am sure that Ukrainian military and Russian military are not going to be on different sides of the barricades, they are going to be on the same side. ‘There can be only one assessment of what happened in Kiev, in Ukraine in general. This was an anti-constitutional coup and the armed seizure of power. ‘If people ask us for help –because we already have an appeal from the legitimate president of Ukraine – we reserve the right to use all the measures to protect those citizens. This is completely legitimate.’ An estimated 16,000 Russian troops are in Crimea but Mr Putin insisted the soldiers in uniforms without insignia who seized key locations were not Russian troops but local self-defence forces. Mr Obama insisted Moscow had violated international law at a conference to discuss Ukraine . ‘We don’t want to enslave anybody, we don’t want to dictate anything to anybody but we cannot stand aside when somebody will be annihilating and using torture,’ added the Russian president. ‘We are not going to meddle. But we think all Ukraine’s citizens, no matter where they live, should have the same rights to ... determine the future of their country.’ Mr Putin claimed the snipers who claimed up to 20 lives in  Kiev could have been planted by protest groups, who he branded ‘semi-fascists’. He said Mr Yanukovych, now facing a ‘mass murder’ probe in his homeland, personally assured him he had not ordered his security services to shoot at unarmed demonstrators. Ukraine’s acting interior minister Arsen Avakov did not say where the suspected killers were from. But it was previously claimed a senior ex-Russian security services chief was staying in a plush hotel advising the government on cracking down on demonstrators. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry lights a candle and lays roses in Kiev for those who died in protests . John Kerry also condemned Russia¿s ¿aggression¿ today while visiting the country. Mr Kerry announced a $1billion economic package for Kiev . In a clear sign of advanced planning – even during the last days of the Sochi Winter Olympics – private security forces were lined up by Moscow to be deployed to Crimea on the quiet. Hundreds of members of Vnevedomstvenaya Okhrana, Russia’s quasi-private interior ministry security force – many of them former soldiers – were deployed to protect Russian Navy installations and assets in Crimea. The private security guards were armed with AK-47 assault rifles and PKM machine guns and wore plain uniforms without any insignia. Regular troops were flown in, equipped with more modern weapons and carrying light anti-tank weapons. Signs that Mr Putin is backpedalling helped the financial markets, which clawed back a large chunk of Monday’s losses. Russia’s RTS shares index, which slumped 12 per cent on Monday rose 6.2 per cent yesterday. In the US, the Dow Jones industrial average was up by 1.4 per cent. ‘Confidence in equity markets has been restored,’ said David Madden, market analyst at IG.

The alliance announced that an extraordinary NATO-Russia council will convene at the suggestion of secretary-general Anders Fogh Rasmussen. Russia agreed to the meeting today, when NATO ambassadors were discussing the crisis among themselves. Rasmussen has previously said Russia's military intervention in Ukraine is in violation of the U.N. charter and threatens peace and security in Europe. The announcement came after Russian troops in control of the Belbek air base in Crimea fired warning shots into the air as around 300 Ukrainian soldiers, who previously manned the airfield, demanded their jobs back. About a dozen Russian soldiers at the base warned the Ukrainians, who were marching unarmed, not to approach. They fired several warning shots into the air and said they would shoot the Ukrainians if they continued to advance.

Earlier in the day, two Russian warships on their way to Crimea passed through Istanbul's Bosphorus straits. The Saratov and Yamal warships, which are usually based in the Mediterranean, were seen sailing unaccompanied through the Marmara Sea before entering the straits at around 7.30am local time.

"The classic unsung hero, as Steven Anderson was described by former boss Owen Coyle recently, will now form one of the high notes of a celebratory St Johnstone tune until the end of time after sending Tommy Wright’s grafters on to glory. The Scottish Cup, 130 years and the  outstanding Steven MacLean — who clinched the prize six minutes from time — are other key lyrics required to laud an achievement that has been so long in the making that it has tested the patience of hundreds of thousands of Saints. But they wait no more to have gleaming silverware in Perth, while at Tannadice, the future remains bright for Dundee United’s young stars of tomorrow. Champions: St Johnstone beat Dundee United 2-0 to win the William Hill Scottish Cup Final on Saturday . Joyous occasion: Steven MacLean (right) celebrates scoring in St Johnstone's 2-0 Scottish Cup Final win . Full stretch: MacLean (right) doubled St Johnstone's lead in the 84th minute at Celtic Park .

Subs Not Used: Wilson, Souttar, McCallum, Gomis, El Alagui . Booked: Paton, Gunning, Ciftci . Attendance: 47,345 . Referee: Craig Thomson (Scotland) The present, though, is absolutely . dazzling for Saints’ men of the moment at a club that runs as one of the . steadiest operations in the otherwise madhouse arena that is Scottish . football. ‘May 17’ — the . date and shirt number of Wright’s star striker Stevie — was supposed to . be the Cup Final omen. But the victory  signpost could actually be found . on a film marked ‘Apr 19’. On . that day last month, Anderson opened  the scoring with a back-post . header as  St Johnstone beat Jackie McNamara’s side  2-0 — a third . success against United on  Premiership business this term. As . part of his planning for yesterday, Wright compiled a DVD for his team . of the sort of goals typically conceded by the Tannadice defence. How . that move paid off as the men from Perth worked the trick once more. Perhaps . it was fitting, after May had grabbed so much of the spotlight all . season for his scoring heroics, that so many of the  understated Saints . shone at Celtic Park. Manager . Wright talked fondly of a photo he liked from the semi-final win over . Aberdeen at Ibrox that featured Anderson, Chris Millar, Frazer Wright . and Dave Mackay celebrating after suffering so many last-four letdowns . over the years. Perhaps the . snapshots of yesterday warrant a double take from some of these guys, . just to confirm their St Johnstone careers will be defined by this . mighty triumph — and never again by near misses. It . was deserved, too. Although they were underdogs yesterday, Saints’ victory was no great surprise. That’s only one loss in the last nine . meetings with United. Wright . had a disagreement with McNamara on the touchline during St Johnstone’s . 1-0 win at Tannadice in March but they were in accord over the . deployment of United’s teenage stars Ryan Gauld and John Souttar. Up for it: Anderson (right) pounced on United goalkeeper Radoslaw Cierzniak (left) mistake to score . Wild scenes: Anderson (centre) celebrates giving St Johnstone the lead in their Scottish Cup triumph . Down and out: Dundee United players look crestfallen having conceded Anderson's goal just before half-time . The . Northern Irishman’s pre-match  prediction was spot on as the youngsters . began on the bench, while he stayed true to the team that won their . semi-final. But it wasn’t inexperience that cost United. Rather, a . couple of dubious moments from goalkeeper Radoslaw Cierzniak proved . critical. And yet it was the . Pole’s counterpart, Alan Mannus, who betrayed signs of early nerves, . spilling a Ryan Dow cross under pressure from Nadir Ciftci. However, . it was St Johnstone who settled into a more assured stride. May . wondered if Cierzniak might be similarly jittery, taking speculative aim . from distance but failing to trouble the keeper, who had warmed up by . the time James Dunne tested him. The on-loan Stevenage man hit a shot . from 22 yards after a David Wotherspoon lay-off and Cierzniak sprang to . tip the shot over. The . corner dropped into the path of Wright’s late arrival into the box but . the ball came off his shin and trickled into the arms of keeper. After . being dumped for each of the last two Hampden showpieces by Pat Fenlon . at Hibs, Wotherspoon made the most of getting the call and he was quick . to pounce on the United wall’s deflection of a May free-kick. After cutting smartly inside Keith Watson, Wotherspoon saw Cierzniak deal well with a shot that took a nick off Gavin Gunning. The league’s second-top scorers, United are never timid for long and at last came a killer delivery from Andrew Robertson.

Heavy hit: St Johnstone's James Dunne (left) battles United's Paul Paton for the ball during the Final . Close but no cigar: Nadir Ciftci (left) hit the bar for Dundee United with a second-half free-kick . Dow . ghosted in to offer a flick that bounded off the base of the far post . and, to the delight of Mannus, back into play before being cleared. United . then claimed for handball against Wotherspoon as Gunning tried to . thread in Dow. But minutes later, it was Wotherspoon who crafted the . opening goal in first-half injury time. His corner convinced Cierzniak to make a bone-headed break from his goal and come flapping for the ball. Anderson, . meanwhile, faked a run to clear himself of close policing and peeled . away to rise and meet the cross six yards out. Watson was the nearest . but helpless attendant as Anderson nodded into the unguarded net. The . St Johnstone manager suspected United might be vulnerable to dead-ball . deliveries in the air. Little wonder, then, that he waved a clenched . fist as he turned heels and darted for the team talk. McNamara’s . was more succinct as his men emerged first after the interval hell-bent . on a quick reply. That made for an increasingly combative second half. The 50th-minute drama provided the moment that must have convinced Saints fans that this would be their day. Ecstasy: St Johnstone players celebrate their first Scottish Cup Final win in their 130-year history . Ciftci, . a bruising presence to front the United attack all afternoon, floated a . free-kick over the wall. Off the crossbar it came, the ball falling . kinder than any Saints player could have dreamt of as it nestled cosily . aside the grounded Mannus when it could easily have cannoned off him and . over the line. Illegal . means were then tried at the opposite end to do just that. Wright’s free . header guided the ball into the path of May, who appeared to be . successfully bundling home a 28th goal of the season before Cierzniak . scrambled a save. May then used his hand for the final nudge. Referee . Craig Thomson  initially awarded the goal, but the extra  officials were . bound to come in useful one of these years and Alan Muir correctly . snatched the celebrations back off the Saints fans. Wotherspoon . at one end, then Robertson at the other, were denied then the call for . Gauld came on 64 minutes, Gary Mackay-Steven making way. Millar was the . shadow for Gauld and the action passed the kid by. Grim viewing: Dundee United manager Jackie McNamara watches on his team lose at Celtic Park . Brian . Graham was introduced to partner Ciftci and no one dug deeper than the . Turkish forward for an equaliser. No one went closer, either, than he . did when rifling a low drive from 20 yards that skimmed the outside of . Mannus’s right hand post. But . it was the extra striker selection of Saints that proved the winner. MacLean’s hold-up play and knockdowns had been a fine feature all day . and, six minutes from time, he shot into centre stage. A . May crossfield pass took a wild deflection and, as MacLean slid in with . Cierzniak, the first crunching contact was a draw. The second scramble . for possession quickly saw the striker hook his foot around the ball and . steer it into the empty net. MacLean . stripped off his top as he wheeled away to greet the acclaim of the . Perth fans and earned the happiest booking of his life. Graham . missed a chance to make it nervy at the death with a free header.

"Poland's government has come under fire for letting 5,000 Russian football fans celebrate their national day marking the end of the . Soviet Union with a patriotic march through Warsaw. The nation's police has also been slammed for being too slow to react to the violence that erupted during the parade, which came ahead of Russia and Poland's 1-1 Euro 2012 draw. Ugly rioting saw 184 arrested, including 156 Poles and 24 Russians, and at least another 24 injured. Scroll down to see footage of the clashes... Aggravation: Polish and Russia fans kick off against each other after the match in Warsaw last night . Battering: Punches, bottles and missiles were thrown despite the attention of 6,000 officers . Angry: Despite the clashes, Poland's government has said it was happy with the number of police who were on patrol . Tension: Russia and Poland have a problematic history, which manifested in last night's violence . But Interior Minister Jacek Cichocki insisted that the 6,400 police, including 2,000 riot officers, sent to deal with . the march to the stadium was sufficient. He told a news conference today: 'In my opinion, the number of policemen was appropriate. I think the police performed well.' And he said he hoped the courts would severely punish all those caught fighting in the streets of the Polish capital. He added: 'When it comes to our . hooligans, I hope the prosecutors and especially the courts will be . strict and these people will fully feel the consequences of their . antics.' Cichocki also said the detained Russians . would face accelerated court procedure and would likely be expelled from . Poland and banned from returning to Europe's border free Schengen area . for five years.

Russia Day, the national holiday of the Russian Federation, has been celebrated on June 12 every year since 1992. The First Congress of People's Deputies of the Russian Federation adopted the Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic on June 12, 1990. The creation of the Presidency, the adoption of the new Russian Constitution, flag, anthem and emblem were major landmarks in the consolidation of Russian statehood. The day when the declaration was adopted- June 12 - was proclaimed as national holiday by Supreme Soviet of Russia in 1992. Russia's first President, Boris Yeltsin, was also elected on the same day in 1991. Edyta Galazkowska, spokesman for Warsaw ambulance service, said 14 Russians, one German, one U.S. citizen and one Pakistani were among the injured. The nationality of seven others was being established. None was in life-threatening condition. A Warsaw police spokesman added: 'We are still monitoring the situation and trying to identify the supporters involved. 'The operation is not over from our side as we continue in our attempts to catch those who are causing trouble.'

In another incident, a group of clearly drunken Polish men began fighting among themselves, hitting and kicking each other.

"As Sergio Aguero fired Manchester City into a 3-0 lead against Liverpool on Monday, the Argentine striker achieved the record for the best scoring rate for a player with a minimum of 15 goals in Premier League history. Aguero had only been on the field for 23 seconds before he sprinted onto a through ball from Jesus Navas to score his second goal in as many Premier League games. The 26-year-old now tops an impressive list of some of the Premier League's finest ever strikers with 54 goals every 113 minutes on the pitch.

Pellegrini's decision to use Aguero from the bench for the first two Premier League games of the season looks to be a wise one as the former Atletico Madrid man has knotched against Newcastle and Liverpool. If Aguero can carry on at the scoring rate, there's no doubt that he'll beat his goalscoring record of the 2013/14 Premier League season which saw the diminutive striker score 15 goals in 23 league appearance for City.

"Federal officials who investigated the deadly TWA flight 800 crash that killed 230 people have insisted it was an accident after a documentary claimed the plane was hit by explosions outside the aircraft. Current and former federal officials said yesterday they stand by their conclusion that the fatal explosion  was caused by overheated fuel tank vapors, and not a bomb or missile. The officials spoke to reporters yesterday at a briefing on the National Transportation Safety Board's four-year investigation following the explosion and crash of the Boeing 747 off Long Island, N.Y., on July 17, 1996. The crash - the third-deadliest aviation accident in U.S. history - occurred just 12 minutes after take-off from JFK International Airport on the flight bound for Paris, France. Scroll down for video . The remains of the TWA Flight 800 from New York to Paris that exploded off Long Island, New York, reassembled from recovered wreckage . Theories have suggested it was a missile . strike from a terrorist or U.S. Navy . vessel, and that the incident was subject to a government . cover-up. The board took the usual step of . organizing the briefing on an investigation that has been closed for . years in response to the documentary set to air this month on the 17th . anniversary of the tragedy. The film says new evidence points to the often-discounted theory that a missile strike may have downed the jumbo jet. The officials who spoke at the . briefing dismissed allegations of a cover-up, saying that the evidence . points strongly to the board's conclusion that overheated gases in the . plane's near-empty fuel tank caused the tank to explode. The gases were most likely ignited by a spark from damaged wiring in a fuel measuring system. Joseph Kolly, the current director of . the board's Office of Research and Engineering, was the chief fire and . explosives investigator on the flight 800 investigation. He said he is 'absolutely' certain the fuel tank was the cause. 'We went to the 'nth degree, and then some,' he said, laying out the different facets of the investigation. Investigators tested shoulder-fired . missiles to see if they would show up on radar and used another 747 to . replicate the overheating of fuel tank vapors, among other tests. 'I am upset about bringing this back . up, for the sake of the people who lost folks in the accident,' Kolly . said. 'It's not good.' Two family members of those killed attended the . briefing. Investigators who worked on the plane following the crash and co-producer Tom Stalcup, said there was no evidence that the explosion came from the wing tank . Federal officials say they stand by claim that crash caused by fuel vapors ignited by faulty wiring. Images from the documentary show damaged seats on the plane, aboard which 230 people died . 'I think they did a complete and . thorough investigation in the beginning,' said Matthew Ziemkiewicz of . Rutherford, N.J., whose sister, Jill, was a flight attendant on the . plane. 'These are old conspiracy theories that have been around since the beginning.' Jim Hurd of Severn, Md., who lost his . 29-year-old son, James, said the board's investigation seems 'pretty . cut and dried as far as I'm concerned. 'But there are still family members who believe it was brought down by a bomb. I respect that.' The documentary features interviews . with key members of the original investigation team, who now claim . that their investigation was systematically undermined. 'This . team of investigators who actually handled the wreckage and victims' bodies, prove that the officially proposed fuel-air explosion did not . cause the crash,' said the film's producers. 'They also provide radar and forensic . evidence proving that one or more ordinance explosions outside the . aircraft caused the crash.' NTSB officials involved . in the investigation who were not at the briefing have also defended its . handling, describing the investigation as one of the most extensive and . exhaustive in the board's history. The board issued a 400-page report on the accident, accompanied by more than 17,000 pages of supporting material. But there have long been doubters. They include three former investigators - one from the NTSB, one from . TWA and one from the Air Line Pilots Association - who appear in the . film. The former investigators have also signed a petition filed with the NTSB to reconsider reopen the probe. Kelly Nantel, a spokeswoman for the . board, said they are considering the petition and has asked parties to . the original investigation for their comments. A decision on whether to reopen the . investigation will be made by board officials who were not part of the . original investigation and were not part of yesterday's briefing, she . said. One of the former investigators who . signed the petition, Hank Hughes, was in charge of reconstructing the . interior of the aircraft cabin for NTSB from debris recovered from the . ocean. Jim Speer, an accident investigator for the Airline Pilots Association who appears in the documentary, inspects damage after the crash. Right, part of the plane's wing is seen in the water off New York . Officials have dismissed allegations of a cover-up, saying evidence strongly points to their conclusion . Hughes said the board 'completely . discounted' the accounts of more than 200 witnesses who say they saw a . streak of light heading toward the plane before it broke apart. Hughes said the plane's reconstructed . fuselage - which reporters were allowed to view after the briefing - . has holes consistent with what would be expected from missile shrapnel. Reporters were not able to see the . holes, he said, because they were on the opposite side of the . reconstructed plane, facing away from the board's briefing area. Hughes offered no explanation why his former colleagues would deliberately ignore important evidence. 'As far as motivation, who did what and why, we didn't get into that. I don't know.' But officials at the briefing and . other former NTSB investigators said an examination of witness . statements showed that what people thought might be a missile was . actually the trajectory of the plane after the fiery explosion, the . force of which broke off some pieces of the aircraft while much of the . remainder of the plane was propelled up and forward, before plunging . into the ocean. Witnesses 'legitimately saw flames . coming down and everything else, and explosions, but it occurred after . the initial center fuel tank explosion,' Tom Haueter, who recently . retired as head of NTSB's aviation office and was a senior investigator . during the flight 800 investigation, said in an interview. The documentary airs on the EPIX premium television channel. The documentary, TWA FLIGHT 800, premieres on July 17 at 8PM ET on cable network EPIX . An image shows the reconstructed section of the plane. Although 90 per cent of the aircraft was recovered, only the section around the central fuel tank was reconstructed .","Federal officials who investigated crash say they stand by conclusion .

"Merchiston Castle School teacher James Rainy Brown, 75, hanged himself at home in Colinton, Edinburgh after claims of inappropriate conduct . A veteran teacher at a private school for boys committed suicide as police probed claims of his 'inappropriate conduct' towards pupils. Bachelor James Rainy Brown, 75, who had worked for 52 years at Merchiston Castle School in Edinburgh, hanged himself at his home shortly after being told of the investigation. It is understood the claims involved lewd and inappropriate comments to pupils rather than physical abuse. Mr Brown had been a respected member of staff at the school, which charges fees of up to £26,655 a year. Shortly after his death two weeks ago, head teacher Andrew Hunter posted an online tribute stating that it was 'too early yet to be definitive about the circumstances of his passing'. Parents were not briefed about the latest revelations surrounding the teacher's death until last week, after the Scottish Daily Mail contacted the school. Mr Brown, who had two nieces, killed himself soon after police visited the school and he was confronted about the allegations. Now his 'heartbroken' family say they hope his name will be cleared. The 'historic' claims were deemed credible enough by Police Scotland to begin an investigation, which is still technically ongoing despite Mr Brown's death. A source close to the probe said: 'A detailed letter was sent to the police which made clear allegations about Mr Brown. 'The police went to the school to speak to the headteacher about the claims which involved inappropriate comments that had been made to pupils of a lewd nature - not physical offences.' It is believed that Mr Brown hanged himself at his home in Colinton, Edinburgh, only an hour after learning about the allegations - although officers have not yet been able to confirm the timescale. A Police Scotland spokesman said: 'There are no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death and a report will be sent to the procurator fiscal.' Mr Rainy Brown was a popular figure at Merchiston Castle School in Edinburgh where he taught for 52 years . A spokesman for Mr Brown's family said: 'This is simply a tragedy. It is so unfair that it should happen to a man who dedicated his entire life to teaching and helping generations of children. 'He was the most dedicated, honourable and popular teacher you could imagine. The school was his life and his lifelong commitment to it belonged to another age. 'We are 100 per cent confident that, when the police have finished their work, his name will be cleared - but that won't bring him back and we miss him terribly.' A spokesman for the school said: 'The events of the past fortnight have been extremely traumatic for everyone associated with Merchiston Castle. 'James was a hugely respected and popular figure here, as shown by the tidal wave of letters, emails and expressions of shock and sympathy from all over the world. His death has come as a tremendous blow to the entire school population.' 'James' death has come as a tremendous blow to the entire school population.' - Merchiston Castle School spokesman . In an online tribute, Mr Hunter said the news that 'JRB' - as the teacher was affectionately known - had died was 'a tremendous blow to the entire Merchiston Castle community'. He added: 'Boys, parents, staff, Merchistonians and former parents have expressed their shock and deep sorrow that this seemingly ever-present figure will no longer be seen on our sports fields or in our classrooms.' The teacher had been 'an enduring and almost ever-present fixture at Merchiston' since arriving as a pupil in 1951. After gaining his physics degree from Edinburgh University, Mr Brown rejoined the school as a science and maths teacher in 1960. Mr Hunter said: 'His wide and varied interests, his unflagging energy and his unmatched commitment to the life of the school over the following 52 years are the stuff of legend.' Mr Brown was called 'an outstanding teacher and academic, sports coach, outdoors enthusiast, housemaster and tutor and leaves an indelible mark across so many aspects of the history of this place'. A 'fitting tribute' was planned, Mr Hunter said. He concluded that Mr Brown's 'unstinting' service to Merchiston 'belonged to another age' and it was 'no exaggeration to say that we will not see his like again'. On a separate Facebook page, someone with the name 'Alice Taxidermist' wrote: 'Why would JRB kill himself? 'Deeply religious, fairly good health, I saw him just past December. 'Huge tragedy in my mind! Why?' The school stated that Mr Brown had requested a private funeral as he had wanted only 'the minimum legal requirements' to be fulfilled.

"Oligarchs and billionaires around the world may build grand mansions and stunning tower-blocks - but none of their homes would sell for more than the Queen's Buckingham Palace, a new study has revealed. The monarch's central London residence has topped a valuation of the world's most expensive houses - with experts saying it is worth more than £1billion. The 18th century palace beat off competition from the ultra-modern Antilia building in Mumbai, India, which is owned by Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani, and Villa Leopolda, the lavish home of Brazilian socialite Lily Safra in Cote D'Azure, France. Four of the top 10 most expensive residences, as compiled by US website comparecamp.com, are in London, and are all within a mile of Hyde Park. Despite competition from sprawling homes in India and the US, Buckingham Palace is the most expensive property in the world at just over £1billion, according to a new study . The 27-story Antilia tower, built by Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani in Mumbai, is the second-most expensive home, the research states . The lavish Villa Leopolda, built by Belgian King Leopold II around at the end of the 19th century for his mistress, is valued at £500million . The huge Fairfield Pond mansion of American businessman Ira Rennert in New York State is valued at £156million in the new list. It boasts its own power plant, as well as three swimming pools and even a bowling alley . The Kensington Palace Gardens home of Indian steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal is in fifth, with the nearby mansion of Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich in ninth and a converted school in Upper Phillimore Gardens, Kensington - owned by Ukrainian businesswoman Elena Franchuk - in tenth. But the list shows that newly-built mansions around the world are fast catching up with property values in Britain's capital. Antilia, a 27-storey, 400,000-sq. ft tower owned by oil and gas billionaire Ambani is valued at £630million. Ambani - ranked by Forbes as the 36th wealthiest person in the world with a fortune estimated at £14billion - completed his Antilia tower in 2010, and it has since dominated the Mumbai skyline. The new list puts the £500million Villa Leopolda in third. It was created joining two huge properties together for Belgian King Leopold II in the late 19th century. It was transferred to its converted into its current appearance by Thérèse Vitali, Comtesse de Beauchamp, in 1919. It is perched on the seaside hills of the French Riviera, not far from the French border with Italy. The top 10 list is completed with four properties in the US; the £156million Fairfield Pond mansion in Sagaponack, New York in fourth, the £126million Ellison Estate in Woodside, California in sixth, the £120 Hearst Castle in Beverly Hills in seventh and £97million Pinnacle mansion in Montana in eighth. Fairfield Pond is a 29-bedroom, 100,000-sq. ft mansion with its own power plant, an estimated 39 baths, a bowling alley, three swimming pools and a 63-acre garden. The home of Indian steel tycoon Lakshmi Mittal in Kensington Palace Gardens, London - dubbed Billionaire's Row - comes fifth in the list . The beautiful, Japanese-style Woodside estate of computer software billionaire Larry Ellison in California is valued at £126million . Hearst Castle, Beverly Hills, built for newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst in 1919, came seventh  and is valued at £120million . Seven, The Pinnacle, the largest property at the exclusive Yellowstone Club in Big Sky, Montana, is valued at £97million and came eighth in the list . Roman Abramovich's London's home, not far from Chelsea's home ground Stamford Bridge, is worth £88million and came ninth in the list . An £80million coverted school in Upper Phillimore Gardens, Kensington, London now owned by Ukrainian oligarch Elena Franchuk, came tenth in the list . The sprawling Fairfield Pond mansion is owned by American tycoon Ira Rennert, whose estimated worth of £4billion was made largely from investing in mining and metals. Sixth placed Ellison Estate is the home of US billionaire Larry Ellison, the co-founder of computer company Oracle, who has an estimated fortune of more than £30million. Buckingham Palace was last valued at £935million by home valuation site Zoopla in 2008, but since then property prices in London have boomed. Although it is unlikely to ever be sold, its new £1billion-plus price tag would include its 775 rooms, including 19 State rooms, 52 Royal and guest bedrooms, 188 staff bedrooms, 92 offices and 78 bathrooms. Just a short walk from Trafalgar Square, Hyde Park and the West End, it also has a cinema, swimming pool, 40 acres of land and its very own post office. Meanwhile, the neighbours of the Queen's grandson, Prince William, do well in the new list. Steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal's home not far from Kate and Wills's Kensington Palace has an estimated value of £140million. The property, bought in 2004 from Formula One chief Bernie Ecclestone, has 12 bedrooms, Turkish baths, a swimming pool and parking for 20 cars. Next door is Roman Ambramovich's mansion. The Russian billionaire and investor's home is said to be one the 'iceberg' homes now becoming common in the capital, with a huge underground extension reportedly planned to become a 'car museum'. With its state rooms and 40 acres of gardens in the  centre of London, Buckingham Palace remains the world's most expensive property . Antilia, named after a mythical island, is said to have a  library, extravagant dining areas, opulent marble floors and even a snow room .

"Nazi hunter: Hanns Alexander, a Jewish refugee serving in the British Army, captured Rudolph Hoss . A German-born Jewish refugee who . served in the British Army during World War II has been unveiled as one . of the leading investigators responsible for the capture of one of the . worst Nazi criminals of the Holocaust. Throughout his life in Britain, Hanns Alexander never spoke of his involvement in the hunt for Auschwitz commander Rudolph Höss, and the truth was not unveiled until after his death. In 1946 he played a crucial role in . bringing Höss to justice, a man responsible . for killing millions of Jewish men, women and children. Rudolph Höss was not only in charge . of the deadliest of the Holocaust concentration camps, he was also the . mastermind behind the use of Zyklon B to commit mass killings of, mainly Jewish, prisoners. Mr Alexander’s story was uncovered by . his great-nephew at the war hero’s funeral in 2006. During a eulogy, Mr . Alexander’s nephews spoke of his past as a Nazi hunter and Thomas . Harding, whose grandmother was Mr Alexander’s sister, began to . investigate his past. Hanns Alexander fled from Berlin to . London in 1936 after his father, already in England, heard rumours of . what was about to take place in their native Germany. When Britain declared war on Germany . in 1939, 22-year-old Hanns and his twin brother Paul volunteer for the . British Army and were placed with the Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps, a . unit of refugees who wanted to fight the Nazis. In 1945, having taken part in the . D-Day landings in Normandy and witnessing the liberation of Bergen . Belsen concentration camp, Hanns Alexander was chosen to take part in a . 12-strong team, tasked with tracking down Nazi war criminals. As the team rounded up the Bergen Belsen . guards and administrators, interpreter Hanns became central in the . interrogations and uncovers Rudolph Höss’s role in the Holocaust. Hanns Alexander then began his hunt for . Höss, knowing that the former Auschwitz Kommendant would hold the key . information to the workings of the Nazi atrocities committed against his . people.

Justice for a killer: Rudolph Hoss's sentence being carried out at Auschwitz, on  April 16, 1947 . After the fall of Auschwitz, Höss and . his family had fled towards the Danish border. British intelligence . had tracked them down to the Flensburg area, where Höss’s wife Hedwig and . their children lived in an old sugar factory. Having managed to intercept a letter from . Hedwig proving that she knew where her husband was hiding, she had been . taken in for questioning. Hanns arrived on March 7, 1946 and begin to interrogate Mrs Höss. She would not budge. But neither would Hanns Alexander. Hanns and members of his team brought in Höss’s oldest son Klaus and threatened Hedwig with deporting him to Siberia. Ignorance is bliss: Rudolf Höss' with children on a slide at the Auschwitz villa a few yards from the camp, 1940-1943 . Ten minutes later, Hedwig had written . down the location and new alias of her husband, who was living at a farm . under the name Franz Lang. Rudolf Höss was arrested on March 11, . 1946. Hanns Alexander and his men dragged him out of hiding and beat him . until he gave up his true identity. Höss stood trial at Nuremberg in April . and was subsequently handed over to Polish authorities on 25 May 1946, . where he stood trial accused of murdering three million people.

"The businessman whose dispute with a fellow airline passenger over a reclined seat sparked a fight and force his flight to divert says he's embarrassed by the way the confrontation unfolded and that he regrets his behavior. But don't expect James Beach to stop using the Knee Defender, a $22 gadget that attaches to a passenger's tray table and prevents the person in front from reclining. He just plans to be nicer about it - and insists that passengers who recline their seats are 'rude'. 'I'm pretty ashamed and embarrassed by what happened,' Beach said on Wednesday. 'I could have handled it so much better.' The argument became so tense that the pilots of the Aug. 24 Newark to Denver flight diverted the Boeing 737 to Chicago. Scroll down for video . 'Reclining seats is rude': James Beach, 6ft 1in, says he is embarrassed by his fight with a woman over his Knee defender but insists he will still use the device . A story about the incident started a broad public discussion of whether passengers should be allowed to recline. In the days that followed, two other flights were diverted under similar circumstances. Beach, 48,  clarified a few things about the episode, primarily that he initially complied with flight attendant instructions to remove the device. For the record, he said, he never reclines his seat. 'You have the right, but it seems rude to do it,' said Beach, who is 6 feet 1 inch tall. The dispute occurred on the final leg of Beach's trip back to his home near Denver. After returning to the U.S. from a business trip to Moscow, he went on standby for an earlier flight for the leg from Newark, New Jersey, to Denver and was given a middle seat. Locked and loaded: Most airlines prohibit the use the of the Knee Defender, James Beach used one so he could continue working on his laptop . When the jet was airborne, Beach took out his laptop to review a contract for his company, which develops waste recycling facilities, primarily in Russia. He used the Knee Defender — a Christmas gift a few years ago from his wife — to prevent the woman in front from reclining. U.S. airlines prohibit use of the Knee Defender, but the devices are not illegal. 'I put them in maybe a third of the time. Usually, the person in front tries (to recline) their seat a couple of times, and then they forget about it,' Beach said. The device comes with a courtesy card to tell passengers that you've blocked them, but he doesn't use it. 'I'd rather just kind of let them think the seat is broken, rather than start a confrontation,' he said. Beach, who said he flies 75,000 to 100,000 miles a year, wasn't so lucky this time. When the flight attendants came through the cabin to serve beverages, the woman said her seat was broken. That's when Beach told one of them about the Knee Defender. The flight attendant asked him to remove the device, and Beach said he did. 'As soon as I started to move it, she just full force, blasted the seat back, right on the laptop, almost shattered the screen. My laptop came flying onto my lap,' he said. Tiny: The Knee Defender, which is about the size of a house key, retails for about $19.95, but is banned by all major American airlines . Beach complained, saying that he couldn't work like that, but the flight attendant informed him that the woman had the right to recline. Both passengers were sitting in United's Economy Plus section, which offers 4 more inches of legroom than the rest of coach. His reply: 'You asked me to let her recline a few inches, and she just took 100 percent of it.' That's when Beach's anger boiled over. He said he pushed the woman's seat forward and put the Knee Defender back in. The woman stood up and threw a cup of soda — not water, as previously reported — at him. 'It was really just surreal and shocking. Did that just happen?' Beach recalls. 'I said, 'I hope you brought your checkbook because you just threw your Sprite all over my $2,000 laptop.'' The flight attendant stepped in quickly and moved the woman to another seat. 'I said a lot of things I shouldn't have said to the flight attendant: some bad words, what's your name and 'I can't believe you're treating me like this,'' he recalled. The pilots then changed course for Chicago — a decision that Beach said 'amazed' him. 'The plane was dead quiet for the rest of that flight,' he added. 'Nobody said a word.' Ira Goldman, who invented the Knee Defender, said the passengers on the other diverted flights got upset after their knees and head were hit by reclining seats. He said airlines are 'trying to wish this problem away.' His solution: Install seats that slide forward within a shell to recline or to allow the use of his device, which has been sold since 2003. 'They're selling the same space twice — to me to sit down and then inviting people to put their seat backs there as well,' he said. When the plane landed in Chicago, police escorted Beach and the woman off. Neither police, nor the airline or the Transportation Security Administration has released any information about the passenger seated in front of Beach. No criminal or civil charges were brought against them, but United would not let them continue on to Denver. Beach says he spent the night at an airport hotel and then caught a flight home the next morning. He flew Spirit Airlines. It has no reclining seats.","Incident occurred last month aboard a United Airlines flight from Newark to Denver .

"Swatch is set to launch its own smartwatch next year in a bid to take on Apple and Google . The world's biggest watchmaker will unveil its new Swatch Touch next summer. It says it sees the sees the advent of the $93billion smartwatches as an opportunity rather than a threat - and warned the tech giants they may face problems. Scroll down for video . Swatch hit out at apple and Google's plans, saying 'Technology alone doesn't sell, not in watches.' The rewards are potentially huge for whoever comes up with a winning formula. Andrew Sheehy, chief analyst at Generator Research, sees the retail value of wearable Internet-connected devices at $93.1 billion by 2018, versus $4.1 billion in 2014, with smartwatches accounting for about two thirds of the market's value in 2018. Swatch Chief Executive Nick Hayek said these new watches might allow the wearer to count the number of steps they take and calories they burn. And there will be a few other cool 'Swatchy' things on offer via latest Bluetooth technology, he said in an interview at the company's headquarters in Biel. 'All the big technology firms want to work with us and I don't rule out that we are or could be collaborating in some areas. But we can also do many things on our own.' Wearable gadgets, such as smartwatches that allow users to connect to their phone to check emails, make calls or monitor their health, are expected to be the next big thing in the tech world and a potential threat to traditional wristwatch sales. Apple Inc has just invited media to a 'special event' next month, fuelling speculation it might present a much-anticipated 'iWatch.' The possibility of an iWatch launch is partly responsible for Swatch shares losing almost 15 percent so far this year, lagging a 3 percent rise in the European sector. Swatch Chief Executive Nick Hayek said these new watches might allow the wearer to count the number of steps they take and calories they burn. 'For Swatch, this could mean a 2 percent hit to revenue and earnings before interest and tax for each 10 percent share that the iWatch was able to gain in its addressable market,' Bernstein analyst Mario Ortelli said in a study in July. Other tech companies are working on smartwatches. Google's Motorola is set to launch a Moto360 smartwatch next week in the United States. But the spotlight is on Apple after the company poached executives from the fashion, luxury and medtech (medical)industries and registered the trademark 'iWatch' in Japan. For many analysts, Swatch and Apple would be the dream team for a smartwatch project, but Swatch has always played down its interest in such a relationship. The argument is that Swatch's business is selling watches not technology. Apple is expected to launch its smartwatch next week. This mockup by designer Martin Hajek shows what it could look like. 'Our first message for customers is the watch. 'If they like it, they might also be interested in the extra functions,' Hayek said. 'It is a problem if you only define a product by its technology. 'Technology alone doesn't sell, not in watches.' His comments highlight the importance of fashion and branding for the development of the smartwatch business. '(Technology firms) that want to strike partnerships with us also want access to brands. 'They want (their products) to be more than a commodity,' the CEO said.","Firm will launch the Swatch Touch next summer .

"A 'massive new batch' of stolen credit and debit card numbers put up for sale on the black market Tuesday morning are now reportedly being traced back to Home Depot. The Atlanta-based home improvement retailer told The Associated Press Tuesday that it's looking into 'unusual activity' and that it's working with both banks and law enforcement. 'Protecting our customers' information is something we take extremely seriously, and we are aggressively gathering facts at this point while working to protect customers,' said Paula Drake, a spokeswoman at Home Depot, declining to elaborate. She noted that if the retailer confirms that a breach occurred, it will notify customers immediately. Unusual activity: Worries that hackers may have accessed a 'massive' trove of credit card numbers from Home Depot triggered an investigation by the chain . Shares of Home Depot Inc. fell 2 percent to $91.18 in late trading. Many retailers have had security walls broken in recent months, including Target, grocery store chain Supervalu, P.F. Chang's and the thrift store operations of Goodwill. The rash of breaches has pushed retailers, banks and card companies to increase security by speeding the adoption of microchips into U.S. credit and debit cards. The possible data breach at Home Depot was first reported by Brian Krebs of Krebs on Security, a website that focuses on cybersecurity. Krebs said multiple banks reported 'evidence that Home Depot stores may be the source of a massive new batch of stolen credit and debit cards.' The Krebs report says that the responsible party may be the same group of Russian and Ukrainian hackers suspected in last year's massive breach at Target Corp. Target, based in Minneapolis, has been overhauling its security department and systems and is accelerating its $100 million plan to roll out chip-based credit card technology in all of its nearly 1,800 stores. Drop: Shares of Home Depot Inc. (HD) fell just before 2 p.m. on Tuesday after news of the chain investigating 'unusual activity' broke . In its massive data breach, 40 million credit and debit card accounts were compromised and hackers stole personal information from as many as 70 million customers. The breach hurt profits, sales and its reputation with shoppers. At Supervalu, the data breach may have impacted as many as 200 of its grocery and liquor stores and potentially affected retail chains recently sold by the company in two dozen states. The breach occurred between June 22 and July 17, according to Supervalu. Restaurant operator P.F. Chang's confirmed in June that data from credit and debit cards used at its restaurants was stolen.","Group of Russian and Ukrainian hackers responsible for the 2013 Target Corp. breach believed to be behind new stolen cards .

"Gareth Bale’s stunning free-kick nine minutes from time spared Wales from the ignominy of drawing with minnow principality Andorra and sparked a pitch invasion from travelling fans. The Real Madrid star struck a brilliant shot that curled into the net and then sent over-exuberant supporters back to their seats after they had crashed over an advertising hoarding to celebrate. He had earlier scored a soaring header to equalise an opening penalty from Andorra, their first competitive goal in more than four years. Scroll down for video . Match winner: Gareth Bale scored a 25-yard free-kick with just nine minutes to go to hand his side all three points . Bend It Like Bale: Real Madrid star spared his side's blushes by curling the ball into the net past Andorra goalkeeper Ferran Pol . Equaliser: Bale cancelled out Ildefons Lima's opener by scoring in the 22nd minute against the European minnows . Celebration: Bale is congratulated by Wales team-mates Simon Church (far right) and Lewis Nyatanga (left) after scoring . Captain fantastic: Andorra skipper Lima upset the odds by scoring after just six minutes against Chris Coleman's side . Rare strike: Andorra celebrate after Lima scores his country's first competitive goal since September 2010 .

Calm down: Captain Ashley Williams was among the players to tell Wales' travelling support to keep cool after Bale's late winner .

Booked: Allen, Church . Manager: Chris Coleman 6.5 . Referee: Slavko Vincic (Slovenia) 5.5 . MoM: Bale . But Bale blasted the artificial pitch at the Estadi Nacional as the ‘worst’ he had played on in his career. The 3G surface would cause awkward rolls and spray black rubber pellets when the ball bounced. ‘I can't describe how bad, bobbly and hard the pitch was to deal with,’ he said. His brace bailed out Chris Coleman who would have faced serious recriminations with defeat here in Wales’s opening Euro 2016 qualifier. This entire nation’s population could fit inside the 85,000-capacity Bernabeu for Real Madrid’s derby against Atletico on Saturday, which is where Bale now heads. Carlo Ancelotti will be relieved the heavy challenges from Andorra’s team did not do harm to his player, but Aaron Ramsey paid a price, limping off with an ankle injury that makes him a doubt for Arsenal’s match with Manchester City on Saturday. ‘He got kick and twist,’ said Coleman. ‘Hopefully he'll be OK for Arsenal at the weekend but we'll have to see what the next 24-48 hours holds.’ Coleman described the pitch as ‘not up to standard of a UEFA qualifier’ and added: ‘I think we showed hell of a lot of courage.’ He paid tribute to Bale. ‘There are only two players in the world, Lionel Messi and Gareth Bale, who could have done something like that tonight,’ said Coleman. ‘Gareth was absolutely magnificent.’ Before the match Zidedine Zidane, manager of Real Madrid’s B side, had spoken about the ‘tragedy’ it would be were his club colleague Bale not perform for at a major international tournament. ‘He is one of the top five players in the world - for him not to be there is just wrong,’ said the French World Cup winner. So it was with a dollop of irony that in the build-up to Andorra’s goal in the sixth minute Bale was dumfounded by a Zidane turn by a part-timer. Gabi Riera dragged the ball skillfully to swerve round his more illustrious opponent and eventually Andorra won a throw-in. From there Marc Vales flicked it on and Ivan Lorenzo fell under pressure from Neil Taylor. At first Slovenian referee Slavko Vincic waved away the hosts’ appeals but seconds later had pointed to the spot after a signal from fifth official Mitja Zganec behind the goal. It looked a soft penalty but Taylor had grabbed Lorenzo’s shirt. Captain Lima, a 34-year-old defender, stepped up in front of the vocal travelling support and calmly sent Wayne Hennessey the wrong way. Andorra had taken the lead and it was incomprehensible. The numbers told you that. For a nation ranked 199 in the world – who have lost their last 44 competitive games, and only won one in their history – this was their first competitive goal in four years. On the run: Attacking midfielder Ramsey attempts to dribble past Andorra's Marc Vales, Carlos Peppe, Gabi Riera and David Maneiro . Injury concern:  Ramsey, who limped off against Andorra, is a doubt for Arsenal's match against Manchester City on Saturday . View from the bench: Ramsey, who has his right ankle strapped, and several of his Wales team-mates watch the final minutes of the Euro 2016 qualifier . Displeased: Wales manager Chris Coleman, who saw his star midfielder Ramsey limp off with an injury, was unhappy with the state of the pitch . Quiet atmosphere: The match was played out in front of a small crowd at the Camp d'Esports in Catalonia . Tricky task: Wales' players such as Neil Taylor, pictured, had to get used to playing on an artificial pitch . High challenge: Wales and Crystal Palace midfielder Joe Ledley competes for the ball after coming on for Church . Dodgy surface: Bale said the surface in Andorra was the worst he's ever played on during his competitive career . Mission complete: Two-goal hero Bale salutes the Wales fans after the final whistle of his side's Euro 2016 opener . Relieved: Bale is all smiles at the final whistle after his late free-kick wins his side all three points against Andorra . It was not so much a roar that went up in this tiny stadium holding 3,300, mostly Welsh, people. But the echoes could be heard as they travelled up the surrounding mountains. A picturesque setting, a nightmarish scenario for Coleman. Bale responded as he has done countless times. First he headed narrowly over from Allen’s corner and then in the 22nd minute found an equaliser that brought much relief. Davies produced a superb deep ball from the left and Bale rose as high as his athletic frame allows and glanced a brilliant header into the far corner. His primal celebration showed how much his country means to him. That continued after the interval. In the 57th minute Bale struck a trademark dipping free-kick that goalkeeper Ferran Pol punched clear and whipped a perfect cross with his weaker foot that Andy King failed to reach fully. It was not all one way, though. Slack play from Ramsey allowed Cristian Martinez a run and shot at goal that flew wide. As the minutes ticked down it looked like a seismic shock was stirring. But Bale came up with the goods. Again.","Real Madrid star Gareth Bale saved the day by netting late winner against European minnows Andorra .

"The number of calories in McDonald's burgers and fries will soon be listed on menus across the country, whether customers want to see them or not. The world's biggest hamburger chain is announcing today that it will post calorie information on restaurant and drive-thru menus nationwide starting on Monday. The move comes ahead of a regulation that will require major chains to post the information as early as next year. 'We want to voluntarily do this,' said Jan Fields, president of McDonald's USA. 'We believe it will help educate customers.' Calorie counting: A McDonald's menu in New York is seen ahead of a change to the U.S.' 14,000 restaurants that will show their menus' calorie content . In cities such as New York and Philadelphia where posting calorie information is already required, however, Fields notes that the information has not changed what customers choose to order. Calorie average for McDonald's 20 listed burgers: 501 . Sodium average for McDonald's 20 listed burgers: 44% of daily value* . *Per cent Daily Values (DV) are based on a 2,000 calorie diet. 'When it's all said and done, the menu mix doesn't change,' she said. 'But I do think people feel better knowing this information.' According to the numbers already published on their website, their 20 listed sandwiches, excluding their Snack Wraps, average out to 501 calories each. The highest sandwich for calorie content is their Angus Bacon & Cheese clocking in 790 calories and 2,070mg of sodium - or 86% of one’s daily value, DV, based on a 2,000 calorie diet. The second runner up is their Angus . Mushroom & Swiss, at 770 calories and 1,170mg (49% DV) of sodium, . and third, their Angus Delux at 750 calories and 1,700 (71% DV) of . sodium. All 20 sandwiches listed average out to 44 per cent of one’s suggested daily value. The Oak Brook, Ill,-based company is also testing healthier options for next year, such as an Egg McMuffin made with egg whites and a whole grain muffin.

The sandwich has Canadian bacon and white cheddar cheese . and clocks in at 260 calories. It will be called the Egg White Delight. The chain is also testing versions of . the McWrap, which is a bigger version of its Snack Wrap that is already . sold in Europe. The wraps have sliced cucumbers and are less than 350 . calories. The posting of . calorie information isn't a magic bullet in fighting obesity but could . have a big effect over time, says Margo Wootan, director of nutrition at . the Center for Science in the Public Interest, which advocates on . nutrition and food safety issues. 'Obesity . isn't the kind of thing where one day you wake up and you're fat. We . gradually and slowly gain weight over time,' she said. So even if only some people are swayed . to make slightly better choices, Wootan thinks there's a big benefit to . providing calorie information. Another . upside is that companies tend to work harder to provide healthier . options when they're forced to display calorie information. Hearty meal: A McDonald's meal featuring a popular Big Mac sandwich, medium fries, and a medium Coca-Cola charms it consumer with a total of 1,140 calories . 'It can be embarrassing, or shocking, so they end up changing the way the product is made,' Wootan said. BREAKFAST: . SALADS: . WRAPS: . SANDWICHES: . DESERT: . The moves also reflect the pressures . McDonald's and other fast-food chains are facing amid growing concerns . about obesity. McDonald's is also facing competition from chains such as .

McDonald's . notes that it has already made strides in improving the nutrition of . its food, such as the automatic inclusion of apple slices in its Happy . Meals. And this summer, McDonald's rolled out . a 'Favorites Under 400' campaign that highlighted the menu items that . had fewer than 400 calories. The company noted that about 80 percent of . its menu items fit the bill. Of . course, not everyone orders just one item. And the chain has been . blamed by critics for fueling obesity rates with its big soft drinks and . other items. A meal . consisting of a Big Mac and medium fries, for example, has 930 calories. Add a 16-ounce Coca-Cola, and the count rises to 1,080 calories. The . decision to post calorie information follows the Supreme Court's . decision this summer to uphold President Barack Obama's health care . overhaul, which requires restaurant chains with more than 20 locations . to post calorie information. The timing of carrying out that requirement . has yet to be worked out. McDonald's, which has 14,000 locations in the U.S., doesn't plan to advertise the posting of the calorie information.

"Home operation: Grace Adeleye carried out the procedure on four-week-old baby Goodluck Caubergs using only a pair of scissors, forceps and olive oil . A midwife who caused a four-week-old baby to bleed to death in a botched home circumcision operation walked free from court yesterday. Grace Adeleye, 67, carried out the procedure on Goodluck Caubergs without anaesthetic, using only a pair of scissors, forceps and olive oil. The nurse, originally from Nigeria, had been paid £100 to perform the operation at the home in Chadderton, Greater Manchester, using a traditional African method known as 'clamp and cut'. But it went drastically wrong leaving the child with a serious wound and causing him to bleed to death despite the efforts of doctors at Royal Oldham hospital to save him. Adeleye was found guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence after a trial at Manchester Crown Court and was given a 21 month suspended jail term yesterday. Justice Keith Lindblom said the boy's death had been 'wholly unneccesary'. 'It was a tragedy, he . was a perfectly healthy baby, he was not ill he had no need of medical . care and he would not have died if you had acted with their care . expected of you as a nurse,' he said. 'No sentence would bring him back or . ease the grief his family must ensure, the pain of losing him will stay . with them what the rest of their lives. 'His mother said it was a tragic . accident but says she can’t find it in herself to wish you any ill . feeling or that you be sent to prison. I accept that you showed genuine . remorse for his death.' The court heard how Adeleye had set herself up as a mobile circumcision 'clinic' for Christian parents - many who had no idea the simple procedure is available on the NHS. She had previously carried out 1,000 . similar procedures in Nigeria and in the UK earned £100 a time for her . legal 'home ops' during which she would say traditional prayers. It emerged during the trial that up to three children a . month are admitted to the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital due to . bleeding after home-based circumcisions. The case has led for calls for mobile circumcision clinics to be made illegal. The Royal Oldham Hospital was just a mile and a half from the family home in Chadderton, near Oldham, but by the time an ambulance was called the child could not be saved . Police investigated after it emerged . Adeleye ignored risks involved in the operation and experts said her . standard of care was 'woefully inadequate'. The tragedy occurred shortly after Goodluck was born in March 2010 and the family moved to Chadderton, near Oldham. Adeleye carried out the operation . after being introduced to the family through a friend as she had . performed many circumcisions over the years and offered her 'experience . and skill’. When she arrived at the family home at . 5pm on April 16 2010, Goodluck was sleeping in his cot in the living . room but was transferred onto a low table in the living room. Nurse: Adeleye was introduced to Goodluck's family through a friend as she had performed many circumcisions before . Adeleye brought her 'instruments' out . of her handbag and dipped a pair of scissors into the water in a kidney . dish - then carried out the procedure without any pain relief for . Goodluck while his mother Sylvia Attiko closed her eyes. Adeleye then cleaned the wound with cotton wool and applied a bandage but it was still bleeding when she left 40 minutes later. Goodluck’s parents, who had no . medical training, called Adeleye later when the bleeding continued but . was told it was 'normal' and 'not a problem'. When the bleeding still hadn't stopped . the following morning, the baby was rushed to Royal Oldham Hospital . just a mile from the family’s home where he died. Post-mortem tests . found Goodluck died from blood loss. Mrs Attiko burst into tears as she . relived the operation and told the jury: 'She said I could close my eyes . if I could not bear to look but Goodluck was upset. He was crying.' 'I was feeling the pain he was going . through. She just said it was a normal thing he would calm down. She . said I should breastfeed him to calm him down.' Adeleye, of Sarnia Court, Salford, . denied wrongdoing. The mother-of-six said she had had no such problems . before and had performed circumcisions on her two grandsons. In mitigation defence counsel Mr Peter . Wright QC said Adeleye had not performed any similar operations since . the tragedy and had retired from nursing. He added: 'Home circumcisions are not . illegal or unlawfully criminal and on this particular and isolated . occasion has been characterised as circumstances of the most tragic . sort. 'The harm here is plainly of the . highest but it appears to be a wholly isolated incident. There is an . inability upon her to comprehend how a procedure undertook so many times . that went so badly wrong.' Most circumcisions in the UK are done . for religious reasons but currently no formal qualifications are . required to perform the operation.","Goodluck Caubergs died at family home in Chadderton following operation .

"George Ford did his England chances no harm by out-kicking and out-thinking rival fly-half Danny Cipriani in front of watching national coaches Stuart Lancaster and Andy Farrell. The 21-year-old orchestrated Bath’s narrow win thanks to some excellent place kicking and a late second-half break which split the Sale defence. His dash from the Sale 22 paved the way for a match-winning try from Bath’s speedy wing Semesa Rokoduguni. Ford then completed a haul of 19 points by adding the conversion and landing a second long-distance penalty to deny resilient Sale a losing bonus point. Front runner: Bath's George Ford gets away from England fly-half rival Danny Cipriani (left) on Saturday . Opener: Bath celebrate their opening try from Anthony Watson (centre), laid on by Ford after 45 seconds . Radar locked in: Ford kicked 19 points for the Sharks as they ran out winners in their season opener . Bath assistant coach Toby Booth revealed afterwards that Ford, who missed out on the summer tour to New Zealand because of a shoulder operation, had cut down on his kicking practice in an effort to stop fatigue. ‘It’s quality not quantity,’ Booth explained. His coaches believe Ford has overdone his training, which caught up at the end of last season when he missed crucial kicks in his team’s failed push for silverware. Booth said Ford’s performance against Sale was going to be closely monitored, because he had played little in pre-season. ‘Everyone was looking to see how he had gone,’ Booth said before talking about how Bath assistant coach Darren Edwards was working with Ford on his place kicking. Last-gasp: Cipriani attempts a try-saving tackle to no avail as Semesa Rokoduguni crosses for Bath's second . Centurian: Cipriani, playing in his 100th game in Premiership Rugby, showed glimpse of class . ‘They are going down the more quality rather than quantity route. George felt that maybe he was overtraining. ‘Perhaps not at the start of the season, but later maybe the fatigue creeps in. The rewards were very good today.’ Advantage Ford: George got the better of Cipriani in their head-to-head to impress England's selectors . Ford’s England rival Cipriani had a quiet afternoon and failed to ignite Sale’s backline. Cipriani, who was replaced following Rokoduguni’s try for Ford’s older brother Joe, kicked all his goals in contributing 10 points but failed to match the dash of his Bath rival. His afternoon included surviving a late challenge from lock Dominic Day in the 26th minute. Day was sin-binned and Cipriani recovered to kick the penalty which put Sale back into the match after a disastrous start. Bath must have thought they were going to win easily when Anthony Watson outjumped new Sale full-back Luke McLean. The catch gave the wing an unexpected opening to the try line 40 metres away. With Ford converting and then adding a penalty, Bath were well set in a match which became scrappy. Sale’s tenacity proved a big factor and a try by livewire centre Mark Jennings helped to cut the half-time deficit to only 16-13. Ford struck early in the second half from halfway to extend Bath’s lead only for Sale to gain the advantage at 20-19 through Mark Easter’s try. However, Bath finished the stronger and Ford supplied the touch of class to burst clear in the 72nd minute. He then capped a fine display by striking a penalty from near halfway.

Children of same-sex couples experience higher levels of general health and family cohesion than those from traditional families, a study shows. But the researchers warned that the stigma associated with their parents' sexual orientation is an ongoing challenge for these children. Researchers from the University of Melbourne surveyed 315 same-sex parents with a total of 500 children. About 80 per cent of the children have female parents, while 18 per cent have male parents. The children raised by same-sex partners scored an average of six per cent higher than the general population on measures of general health and family cohesion. They were equivalent to those from the general population on measures of temperament and mood, behaviour, mental health and self-esteem. Lead researcher Dr Simon Crouch said same-sex couples are more likely to share child-care and work responsibilities more equitably than heterosexual parent families, based more on skills rather than gender roles. 'This appears to be contributing to a more harmonious household and having a positive impact on child health,' he said. But about two-thirds of these children experience some form of stigma due to their parents' sexual orientation, he said. 'What we have found is that the more stigma these families experience the greater the impact on the social and emotional wellbeing of children.' The most recent census counted 6300 children living in same-sex couple families. Positive impact: same-sex couples' harmonious households are improving the health of their children, study shows.

"One major trend emerged from Monday's transfer deadline day — the growing importance of the loan. Nearly half of all deals in a final 24 hours of trading were loans rather than permanent transfers — Radamel Falcao, Javier Hernandez, Lewis Holtby, Marco van Ginkel and Sebastian Coates among them. Over the weekend, Chelsea’s £50million striker Fernando Torres completed an unprecedented two-year loan to AC Milan. Once the domain of lower league clubs from who couldn’t rub two ha’pennies together, being involved in a loan deal is now the ultimate status symbol of the super-rich. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Javier Hernandez does keepy-ups at Real Madrid unveiling . Pose: Radamel Falcao holds his Manchester United jersey aloft after completing a season-long loan move . Proud: Falcao poses with Manchester United assistant manager Ryan Giggs on Monday . It was fitting that Chelsea did the Torres deal with one of Italy’s biggest clubs. Nobody has embraced the fashion for loans more than Roman Abramovich, who has allowed two entire teams of Chelsea players to be ‘borrowed’ by other clubs, usually with a fee involved. It’s become an important new revenue stream for the Chelsea, who signed goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois at 19 and promptly let him go to Atletico Madrid for three seasons while retaining his registration. That only tells half the story though. Uefa financial fair play restrictions and escalating transfer fees mean even the biggest revenue earners like Manchester United have to keep a close eye on spending if they don’t want to fall foul of the new rules. Short-term fix: Fernando Torres gives the thumbs up as he joined AC Milan on a two-year loan . VIDEO I needed a new adventure - Torres . New boy: Fernando Torres watches AC Milan take on Lazio after signing a two-year loan deal at the San Siro . Hence on Monday they became one of many big clubs to embrace the loan, agreeing to pay a £6m fee plus mega-wages to take Falcao from Monaco for a year. Not to be outdone, Real Madrid agreed to take Javier Hernandez from Old Trafford in similar circumstances. United’s decision to sign Falcao initially for just a year makes sense. Having splashed out £200m in the last 12 months on Marouane Fellaini, Juan Mata, Luke Shaw, Ander Herrera and Marcos Rojo, another £50m on Falcao was considered excessive at Old Trafford. Yet Louis van Gaal wanted the player and Monaco knew the Colombian was fed up playing in front of minuscule crowds in the south of France. Back again: Lewis Holtby returned to the Bundesliga with Hamburg from Tottenham Hotspur on loan . To all concerned, a loan was the perfect answer. United have got a world-class player for a relatively low fee and Monaco’s own FFP concerns are eased by getting the Colombian’s estimated £300,000-a-week wages off their books. FFP was once derided as impossible to enforce. In fact, it’s had a major impact. Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain will play with reduced squads in the Champions League this season for breaking FFP rules. Another offence and Uefa may kick them out of next year’s competition. Other clubs have taken note. To avoid sanction for over-spending, clubs, agents and players have found their short-term fix. It’s called a loan.","The growing importance of the loan was evident on Monday .

"Arsenal have been left sweating on the fitness of Olivier Giroud  after the striker was sent for a second ankle scan. Manager Arsene Wenger may be forced to revive his interest in Loic Remy or scrap the £10million sale of Lukas Podolski if the French international striker is ruled out for any length of time. Sportsmail understands that Giroud, who sustained the injury during the closing stages of Saturday’s 2-2 draw against Everton,  will miss at least the next two weeks and there are even fears he has suffered a broken foot, which would rule him out for months rather than weeks. Crocked: Olivier Giroud went down against Everton and he will have a second scan on his injured ankle . Ecstasy to agony: Giroud had equalised with a bullet header moments before suffering the injury . Reinforcements: Arsene Wenger may make a move for Loic Remy to replace the injured Giroud . Giroud originally believed he could be fit for Wednesday’s make-or-break Champions League qualifier against Besiktas, but he is now set to miss the second leg against Slaven Bilic's side. An initial scan failed to clear up the extent of the damage and Giroud was sent for a second examination after the inflammation of the joint had fully subsided. A long term lay-off for Giroud, the club’s first-choice striker, would leave the club desperately short of centre-forward options and force Wenger’s hand in the transfer market. Back of the net: The French striker scored  for Arsenal against Everton but may have broken his foot . If the Frenchman is sidelined for a sustained period of time, then Wenger could revive their interest in Queens Park Rangers striker Loic Remy. The striker was close to joining the Gunners earlier this summer, with the north London club willing to meet his £8.5million release clause. But Arsenal’s refusal to match his £90,000-per-week wage demands saw the deal fall through. Giroud’s injury could also force the club into a rethink over Lukas Podolski’s future. On his way? Lukas Podolski (right) was thought to be leaving Arsenal, but an injury to Giroud could see him stay . The Germany international wanted to leave the club in search of first-team football, and Wenger has given him the green light to depart so long as a club meets his £10million asking price. But a serious injury to Giroud could yet see Podolski, who is wanted by Juventus, Wolfsburg and Galatasary, stay at the Emirates Stadium. The club were faced with a similar scenario last season when dealing with Jack Wilshere’s broken foot. Following a 50/50 challenge with Daniel Agger while playing for England in March, the midfielder was given the all clear during an initial scan on his ankle. But a second scan showed up a hairline fracture to his left foot. Desperate times: Wenger has been reluctant to buy another striker, but he may now be forced to do so . And the club will wait for clarification on Giroud’s second scan before fully disclosing the details of his injury. Arsene Wenger will address the issue at Tuesday’s pre-match press conference ahead of Wednesday's Besiktas clash. Giroud’s fitness isn’t the only selection headache for Wenger, who will also be without the suspended Aaron Ramsey following his red card in the first leg, and captain Mikel Arteta who is still suffering with an ankle injury. Arteta is expected to be available for the Barclays Premier League showdown against Manchester City on September 13, while Yaya Sanogo is expected to return to the squad for the clash against Besiktas after a hamstring problem. But it is Giroud’s injury that is causing Wenger the biggest concern. Like our dedicated Arsenal Facebook page here.","Olivier Giroud went down injured against Everton on Saturday .

"After track problems caused delays and misery for thousands of passengers yesterday, it was a brave decision to carry the Olympic torch on London's tube network. But to the relief of Games organisers, the stunt passed without incident this morning as the flame was transported along the District line between Wimbledon and Wimbledon Park .

John Light, 64, who has worked on the London Underground since 1963, with the Olympic flame on a District Line tube train at the start of Day 67 of the torch relay . But a series of problems across the network today and yesterday showed that London may struggle to cope with the millions of visitors to the Olympic Park. Services to and from Stratford were delayed for a second day, this time following a signal failure at Custom House on the Docklands Railway. It meant there were delays between Stratford International and Woolwich Arsenal and between Beckton and Canning Town. On the main line, evening services using three main London stations - London Bridge, Cannon Street and Charing Cross - were delayed by a signalling problem which resulted in buses having to replace trains between Tunbridge Wells and Tonbridge in Kent. In the morning, London Overground trains between Euston and Kilburn High Road and Piccadilly line services between Heathrow and Hatton Cross were suspended following track faults. It followed similar problems yesterday on the Overground between Canonbury and Stratford - where the Olympic Park is located - and on the Central line. And it came as 60,000 people tried to reach the Olympic Stadium for a rehearsal of Friday's opening ceremony. The torch travelled from Kingston upon Thames to Ealing today in the latest leg of the nationwide relay and one of the morning stops was Kew Gardens.

British tennis player Oliver Golding stood with the torch at the centre of the rings. Among the 144 torchbearers today were double Olympic rowing champion James Cracknell, skier Chemy Alcott, singer Katy B and music producer Mark Ronson. Mr Light, who has worked for London Underground since 1963, said: 'Transporting the Olympic flame is a once in a lifetime experience. I feel really privileged to have been given this opportunity to be part of the Games in this way. 'I’ve worked for London Underground for 49 years so to be able to hold the flame on its Tube journey is a huge honour for me and a moment I will treasure for the rest of my life.' Cracknell was the day's first torchbearer, running with the torch at the Hook Community Centre in Kingston.

Skeleton racer Adam Pengilly, who won silver at the 2009 World Championships, carried the flame in Kingston. Musician Mark Ronson called for Sir Paul McCartney to perform at the London 2012 closing ceremony as he gave the Olympic flame a taste of university life. The Grammy award-winning producer joined singer Katy B at Brunel University in west London as they carried the torch on day 67 of the relay. Both music stars were nominated to carry the flame after they produced an anthem for the Games, sampling the sounds made by international athletes training for London 2012. After running with the flame, Ronson revealed he has been working with Sir Paul and said the former Beatles star would be the perfect choice to represent Britain on stage at the Olympic closing ceremony. Ronson said: 'I think people like Paul McCartney are ingrained in the history of British music. 'We've been working together a little bit. When he tells you to show up, you just show up. Legacy: Singer Katy B passes the Olympic flame to musician Mark Ronson at Brunel University. Both music stars were nominated to carry the flame after they produced an anthem for the Games . After running with the flame, Ronson revealed said: 'Once the Olympics starts to descend on the city you want to be part of that emotion' 'I think that the other concerts like . Blur and The Specials are great, and with Dizzee and us at Hyde Park on . Thursday, London is such a centre for a music. It's a good way to . celebrate that.' Recalling that he was nicknamed . 'Wrong-way Ronson' at school after going the wrong way in a relay race, . Ronson joked: 'This entire week I was doing four and five kilometre runs . in the mountains of Corsica so I was sort of ready. 'It's pretty emotional with so many . people out. London is such a spoilt city in a way because there is so . much in the way of culture. But once the Olympics starts to descend on . the city you want to be part of that emotion.' Katy B said: 'I can't believe it's . happening and it's kicking off on Friday. I feel really lucky to be . holding the torch so close to the Games beginning.'

"E-cigarettes can contain higher amounts of certain toxins than regular cigarettes, according to U.S. scientists. Researchers at the University of South California found vapour emitted by the gadgets contains the toxic element chromium, which is not found in traditional cigarettes, as well as four times more nickel than found in traditional tobacco. The electronic replacements also contain lead, zinc and other toxic metals, although in lower levels than cigarettes. Professor Constantinos Sioutas, from the University of South California said the raised levels of toxic metals found in electronic cigarettes are concerning, although overall his research found e-cigarettes are less harmful than traditional cigarettes. Researchers at the University of South California found vapour emitted by the gadgets contains the toxic element chromium, which is not found in traditional cigarettes, as well as four times more nickel than found in traditional tobacco . He said: ‘Our results demonstrate that overall electronic cigarettes seem to be less harmful than regular cigarettes, but their elevated content of toxic metals such as nickel and chromium do raise concerns.’ Lead author of the study, Arian Saffari, added: 'The metal particles likely come from the cartridge of the e-cigarette devices themselves – which opens up the possibility that better manufacturing standards for the devices could reduce the quantity of metals in the smoke. 'Studies of this kind are necessary for implementing effective regulatory measures. E-cigarettes are so new, there just isn’t much research available on them yet.' For this study, the researchers conducted all of the experiments in offices and rooms. While volunteer subjects were smoking regular cigarettes and e-cigarettes, the researchers collected particles in the indoor air and studied the chemical content and sources of the samples. 'Offices and rooms– not laboratories – are the environments where you’re likely to be exposed to second-hand e-cigarette smoke, so we did our testing there to better simulate real-life exposure conditions,' Dr Saffari said. The research comes after the World Health Organisation issued a report advising that the use of e-cigarettes should be banned indoors and all advertising stopped until the industry produces ‘convincing supporting scientific evidence and obtains regulatory approval’. Professor Constantinos Sioutas, from the University of South California, branded the findings a 'concern' Backing this call, Ram Moorth, deputy chair of the British Medical Association’s board of science called for further regulation of e-cigarettes. He told Forbes tight controls are needed so that they aren't aggressively marketed towards young people and so that their sale doesn't normalise the act of smoking. He said: ‘Tighter controls are needed to ensure their use does not undermine current tobacco control measures and reinforces the normalcy of smoking behaviour. 'There is a need for research to understand the health impacts of e-Cigarettes on both the user and bystanders, and it is vital that the sale of e-cigarettes is appropriately regulated to ensure they are not sold to minors, and are not aggressively marketed to young people as tobacco was in the past.’ He added that health claims made by companies selling e-cigarettes need to be backed up by independent scientific evidence. He said: ‘Any health claims must be substantiated by robust independent scientific evidence to ensure that the consumer is fully informed regarding potential benefits and risks of e-Cigarettes.’ E-cigarettes sold in the north east of England were found to contain a chemical called diacetyl, which can cause serious lung disease when inhaled . E-cigarettes sold in the north east of England were found to contain a chemical called diacetyl, which can cause serious lung disease when inhaled. Diacetyl- used to add butterscotch flavour to liquid tobacco- is harmless to eat, but when inhaled is known to cause a serious condition called ‘popcorn lung’, or bronchiolitis obliterans. ‘Popcorn lung’, which struck workers in popcorn factories who inhaled large amounts of diacetyl, is an irreversible disease which scars the lung and makes it impossible to breathe properly. The e-cigarettes were being made by one of the country’s biggest e-cigarettes firms VIP, and have been withdrawn following an investigation by the BBC. VIP have withdrawn the product, and Lynne White, head of retail for the company said VIP was investigating how this happened. She told the BBC: ‘This is our first issue in five years. We sell millions of bottles a year. We are very sorry it has happened, we are investigating how it has happened.’ Dr Graham Burns, consultant physician in Respiratory Medicine at Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust told the BBC that popcorn lung can sometimes be so severe it leads to a lung transplantation. He said: ‘That particular chemical - diacetyl - is associated with an unusual but well-established lung condition called popcorn worker’s lung.’ ‘It has been inhaled in significant quantities in people who worked in popcorn manufacturing factories.’ ‘In those individuals it has caused a very serious lung condition, serious enough to warrant lung transplantation.’","U.S. researchers found vapour from e-cigarettes contains toxic element chromium and four times more nickel than found in normal cigarettes .

Special permission had to be gained for the hour bell at the Palace of Westminster to be allowed to toll out of its regular sequence. It will strike more than 42 times between 8.12am and 8.15am on July 27 to herald the beginning of the first day of Games. It will be the first time Big Ben has been rung outside its regular schedule since February 15 1952, when it tolled every minute for 56 strokes from 9.30am for the funeral of King George VI. The chiming for London 2012 will be a live performance as everything will have to be done by hand. Mike McCann, Keeper of the Great Clock, said: 'We need to manually lift the brake that controls the weight that drives the mechanism that strikes Big Ben.' The bells at the National Assembly for Wales, Stormont in Northern Ireland and the Scottish Parliament will also ring so that all four Parliaments will be chiming in unison at 8.12am, London 2012 said. The event - titled All The Bells - will be the first big celebration to kick off the Games. The idea is the brainchild of Turner Prize-winning artist and musician Martin Creed for the London 2012 Festival, who suggested all the bells in the country should be rung as loudly as possible for three minutes. He called it Work No 1197. House of Commons Speaker John Bercow said: 'It is a sign of how special this summer is when one of the world's most famous bells will ring outside its regular schedule so it can be part of this London 2012 Festival commission to ring in the Olympic Games.' The event aims to set a world record for the largest number of bells to be rung simultaneously and can include any from children with handbells, through people ringing bicycle bells and doorbells, to experienced change ringing experts of tower bells and church bells. All The Bells will be the London 2012 Festival's biggest community celebration for the Games, according to Ruth Bells will be ringing everywhere from Britain's northernmost inhabited house in Skaw in the Shetland Isles, to the UK's most westerly church in Tresco in the Scilly Isles.","Director Danny Boyle asked spectators to keep quiet about everything they saw so it is not spoiled for billions around the world on Friday .

"Greedy: Bob Crow, who has been accused of holding London to ransom ahead of the Olympics, has announced further industrial action . Hardline union leader Bob Crow is again threatening to disrupt the Olympics just days before they begin with industrial action on the London Underground. The boss of the Rail Maritime and Transport union has spent the build-up to the Games striking pay deals for transport workers - threatening crippling strikes if the demands aren't met. And although they are already set to receive hefty bonuses, Tube employees are now to stage a work-to-rule from Friday in a fresh dispute. The RMT union, which represents thousands of . Tube staff, said it was in dispute over implementing an Olympics pay . deal, as well as the use of casual workers. Thanks to the RMT, Tube drivers will . receive up to £1,000 in bonuses, with other workers - including . engineers and barrier staff - earning an additional £850 for working during the Games. In October last year, tube drivers secured a 20 per cent pay hike to boost their average salary to more than £50,000 a year over the next four years - almost twice the national average wage of £26,000 a year. Despite this, Crow has orchestrated industrial action on behalf of Underground workers several times, as he believes workers in the union are not being treated . fairly. In a separate dispute, the . union announced a strike by cleaners on the Tube and Docklands . Light Railway (DLR) from Friday morning until Sunday, the first weekend . of the Games. LU said the most recent action would have no impact on services. The union said its members working as cleaners for contractors on the Tube and DLR will strike for 48 hours from Friday morning after voting for action over Olympics payments. From Friday until further notice, all RMT members on the Tube are instructed not to work outside their job description. RMT general secretary Mr Crow, who has been accused of holding the country to ransom over Games bonuses for workers, has claimed Tube and DLR cleaners are 'treated like dirt'. He said: 'While the likes of Jeremy Hunt, and the rest of the Government, are sitting in the well-padded VIP seats in the Olympics Stadium as a nice little bonus, our cleaners on the Tube and DLR, who work round the clock in appalling conditions, are being treated like dirt over recognition for the extra workload they will carry from the millions of extra passenger journeys associated with the Games. Disruptive: Tube workers went on strike in April this year, and although workers on the Underground aren't striking, Crow announced further industrial action . 'Even at this late hour there is time for the cleaning companies, and Mayor Boris Johnson, who hires them, to settle this dispute which is about ensuring an inclusive Olympics where everyone shares in the benefits. 'Meanwhile, our wider London Underground membership will be taking action short of a strike in defence of the existing casualisation dispute settlement and to protect their position in light of problems with the implementation of the Olympics recognition and reward agreement.' Howard Collins, LU’s chief operating officer, said: 'We reached agreement with all four unions at the end of May on how we can fairly reward our staff and operate services during the London 2012 Games. 'Since then we’ve been working to ensure that the Tube will have the required level of staffing to run enhanced services during the Games. 'We have written to the RMT leadership to provide the reassurance necessary that our agreement is being implemented as intended, and that all staff working in LU stations will have had full and detailed safety training to work alongside qualified supervisors and managers. Ready for delays? Tfl have warned their passengers to prepare for lengthy delays throughout the Games . 'The fact that four-fifths of those balloted chose not to vote or voted ""no"" to industrial action shows that we have the support of our staff. 'I know they are keen to play their part in the Games and, now that we have agreement across the board, we can all look forward to focusing on supporting a fantastic summer of sport and cultural events in London.' Phil Hufton, asset performance director for London Underground, said the cleaners’ row was between the contractors and the staff, adding: 'We have reviewed our staffing plans and have already put contingencies in place. 'We anticipate very little impact on London Underground services as a result of this industrial action.' RMT has also announced action short of a strike on South West Trains from Friday in a separate dispute over an Olympics bonus.","Tube drivers already handed £1,000 'bribe to work' after RMT threats ."
"Josh Elliott has revealed that when he was a teenager his father's revelation that he was gay caused him to question his own sexuality. The Good Morning America anchor told how he was struck with loyalty and confusion when his father came out when Josh was 13-years-old. 'My first feeling when my father told me was loyalty- thinking ""I guess I have to be gay too. Maybe I'm gay,""' he said on The View this morning. Opening up: Josh Elliott was guest hosting The View Monday morning when he talked about what it was like to find out that his father was gay when Josh was 13-years-old . Historic: The conversation turned to homosexuality in relation to college football star Michael Sam's announcement that he is gay . 'It's a lot to work through as an 8th grade boy.' Elliott's father died suddenly two years after coming out, but the newscaster said that he was happy to have that short period of openness before his father's death because he could see him for who he really was. 'For two years I got to see him complete and out and proud,' Elliott said on The View. 'Thank you for letting me tell my father I Love you dad, and thank you for everything,' he said at the end of Monday's show. He was inundated with positive messages on Twitter after the broadcast, including one from The View cohost Jenny McCarthy. Throwback: Josh's sister shared this photo of their father after Josh spoke about him on The View . 'Thanks, Jenny--especially for the chance to share a bit of the man to whom I owe everything. And: great to see you today,' he wrote. His sister shared a picture of their father, thanking Josh for 'giving dad a voice so powerful'. This was not the first time that the 42-year-old journalist has spoken about his father, who adopted him at birth with his wife before they split when he came out. Elliott also spoke about his father at a GLAAD awards dinner in 2012. Groundbreaking: Michael Sam came out over the weekend, and he is expected to be a top NFL draft pick meaning that he will be the first openly gay professional football player . The subject came up this morning because of the announcement by college football player Michael Sam that he is gay. Elliott, who worked for ESPN before transferring to Good Morning America, said that Sam's announcement shook him because his 'two worlds collided'. 'I really didn't sleep last night,' Elliott said after hearing Sam's announcement. Because Sam is expected to be one of the top NFL draft picks, he will inevitably become the first openly gay professional football player. Elliott likened Sam to Jackie Robinson, the first professional African American baseball player.","Good Morning America co-host was adopted as a baby and his parents split up when his dad came out as gay .

"Luca Di Montezemolo's tenure as president of Ferrari would appear to be drawing to a close, despite his statements to the contrary during the course of the Italian Grand Prix. Rumours swirled ahead of the race at Monza that after 23 years at the helm, Di Montezemolo was on his way out. But on Saturday, standing on the steps of the Ferrari motorhome, the 67-year-old made clear he would be seeing out a three-year contract he signed in March. Defiant: Di Montezemolo made it clear at Monza he wanted to see out his three-year contract with Ferrari . Results: Despite a strong driving line-up, Ferrari under Di Montezemolo have failed in recent years to win . Such comments, however, have earned a rebuke from Sergio Marchionne, the head of Ferrari's parent company, FIAT/Chrysler. Marchionne's comments followed a miserable home race for Ferrari as Fernando Alonso retired whilst Kimi Raikkonen was only ninth. Whilst Di Montezemolo has revitalised Ferrari as a car company, with the prestige manufacturer poised to announce record results soon, on track in Formula One the Maranello marque has floundered. If Di Montezemolo is to leave, then Marchionne has suggested it will be on the basis Ferrari are without a title in F1 for six years. Criticism: FIAT and Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne has claimed that Di Montezemolo is not bulletproof . Tough times: Fernando Alonso (above) retired whilst Kimi Raikkonen was only ninth at Monza . Not present at the grand prix, but speaking to reporters post-race at an event 25 miles from Monza, Marchionne said: 'The heart of Ferrari is winning in Formula One. 'I don't want to see our drivers in seventh and 12th place. To see the Reds in this state,with the best drivers, exceptional facilities, engineers who are really good, to see all that and then to consider we have not won since 2008... 'The important thing for Ferrari is not just the financial results, but also it is winning, and we have been struggling for six years.' Marchionne has also confirmed that whilst Di Montezemolo may have put pen to paper on a new deal six months ago, he is not bulletproof. Last time: Kimi Raikkonen lifted the Drivers' Championship in 2007, the last time Ferrari won the title . 'On volume and economic results, Luca has done an outstanding job,' added Marchionne. 'We are good friends, but when I read his statements these are things I would not have said myself. 'I consider myself essential, of course, but I also know very well I am at the service of this company. 'So to create positions, illusions that one can operate outside the rules, is talking rubbish. 'It's the same for him as it is for me - we serve the company.

"In a stadium named after a company built on duty-free shopping, Arsene Wenger watched two points disappear while weighing up the value of one final dash to the tills before the gate closes. At the King Power Stadium there was no late goal from Arsenal as there has been twice already this season, and no one stepping up to support the manager’s theory that he has the strike options to survive the long haul. Alexis Sanchez was on target with his second goal in five days to put the visitors ahead but the lead lasted only two minutes. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arsene Wenger admit his steam were lacking freshness after two difficult weeks . Clean strike:  Alexis Sanchez scores his second goal in as many game to put Arsenal into the lead . Pressing hard: Leicester defender Ritchie De Laet keeps an eye on Arsenal full-back Nacho Monreal . Midfield battle: Liam Moore fights for the ball with Aaron Ramsey as Arsenal sought to dominate early on . Telling touch: Yaya Sanogo stretches for Santi Cazorla's chipped ball to set up Sanchez's opener . Leicester: Schmeichel 7; De Laet 6.5, Morgan 8, Moore 7.5, Konchesky 7; Mahrez 6.5 (Albrighton 65, 6.5), Hammond 7, King 7, Schlupp 7 (Vardy 70, 6.5); Ulloa 7.5 (Drinkwater 77), Nugent 6.5 . Subs: Cambiasso, Hamer, Wasilewski, Wood. Booked: Moore, Albrighton, Hammond . Pearson: 7 . Arsenal: Szczesny 6.5; Debuchy 6.5, Mertesacker 6.5, Koscielny 6 (Chambers 26, 6.5), Monreal 6.5; Ramsey 7, Flamini 6.5; Sanchez 7, Ozil 6, Cazorla 6.5 (Chamberlain 77, 6.5); Sanogo 5 (Podolski 77, 5) Subs: Rosicky, Wilshere, Martinez, Campbell . Wenger: 6 . Leonardo Ulloa quickly levelled for Leicester, who proved they are ready to compete in the Barclays Premier League. Nigel Pearson’s team were aggressive, committed and dangerous on the break as they were roared on by a boisterous home crowd. They are yet to win and they conceded long spells of possession to the visitors but they have taken two points which may be vital from a tough trio of fixtures against Everton, Chelsea and Arsenal and supporters filed out feeling positive about the campaign ahead. ‘We didn’t feel particularly threatened,’ said Pearson, and Wenger agreed his team had lacked creativity and sharpness while over- complicating their approach play. Arsenal are yet to find any fluency this season. They needed a winner in stoppage time to beat Crystal Palace on opening day and a late equaliser by Olivier Giroud, before he suffered the injury which will rule him out until the new year, at Everton last week. Still, Wenger remains reluctant to make a hasty call on signing a new centre forward when he has Sanchez, Yaya Sanogo, Lukas Podolski and Joel Campbell. Sanogo started up front but with little joy other than to assist with the opener in the 20th minute, when Leicester allowed Arsenal too much space around their penalty box. Aaron Ramsey rolled a square pass to Santi Cazorla, who scooped the ball forward. Sanogo turned and poked an unconvincing effort at goal and, as Kasper Schmeichel sprang from his line to block the shot, the rebound spun to Sanchez, who crashed it in from close range. Two minutes later, Leicester were level when Laurent Koscielny misjudged Jeff Schlupp’s cross from the left and Ulloa applied a firm header to beat Wojciech Szczesny with his second goal of the season. HERE'S HOW LEICESTER OPENED ARSENAL UP FOR THE EQUALIZER - CLICK HERE TO SEE MORE FROM MATCH ZONE . Opener: The Chilean makes no mistake from just outside the six-yard box . Immediate: Ulloa rises above a struggling Laurent Koscielny to level for Leicester straight away . Vital: It was Ulloa's second Premier League goal since joining from Championship side Brighton this summer . Thorn in the side: Riyad Mahrez was a constant threat as Leicester more than matched Arsenal in the first half . Wenger attributed the goal to Koscielny, who he said was uncomfortable after suffering a cut in an accidental clash of heads with Schlupp when the game was still goalless. Koscielny went off to have the wound tended but continued to have problems. ‘If he wasn’t injured, we wouldn’t have conceded the goal,’ said the Arsenal boss. ‘He was not concussed. He was cut on the top of his head. Maybe he didn’t feel comfortable heading the ball after that.’ Koscielny came off soon afterwards, although he will be fit by the time his team are back in action, against Manchester City on Saturday week. There were other injury scares for the Londoners, one of which will concern England manager Roy Hodgson. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain hobbled off at the end and Mesut Ozil went down after twisting his right ankle and immediately signalled to be replaced before realising three substitutes had already been used. Both Ozil and Oxlade-Chamberlain soldiered on but Arsenal found no way through Leicester’s defence. Ulloa was guilty of missing the clearest chance to win the game early in the second half, when he twisted clear of Calum Chambers inside the area and deceived Szczesny only to clip his shot into the side-netting. Diving in: Mathieu flamin and Dean Hammond both show their studs competing for the ball . Nervy bench: Arsene Wenger watches on in the second half as his side struggle to break down Leicester . ‘He will be disappointed not to finish that one,’ said Pearson. ‘But it was super skill from him and he’s proved already he has the capability to perform at this level.’ Ulloa was untidy at times but physical and made life awkward for Arsenal’s central defenders. In many ways he typified what Leicester did well. They surrendered much possession but unsettled Wenger’s team on the break and kept going to the end. Szczesny saved from Jamie Vardy in the closing stages and Danny Drinkwater fizzed a low drive wide. As ever, it was Ramsey who drove Arsenal on, seemingly the only one able to inject any urgency into the passing sequences. Even so, he failed to take advantage when Cazorla picked out one of his forward runs and clipped the ball on to his head. Ramsey seemed caught between going for goal and nodding down towards Sanogo. In the end, he headed tamely at Schmeichel, who also saved at full stretch from Sanogo, a striker whom Wenger conceded had seen his confidence hit by the 17-game wait for his first competitive Arsenal goal. ‘If you play up front and you don’t score it’s very quickly a problem,’ said Wenger. ‘He did find it very hard, and he didn’t score. Yes, it is on his mind, of course. He is a striker.’ Golden chance: Yaya Sanogo had an opportunity to score his first competitive goal, but Schmeichel saved .

"The FBI believes it knows the identities of the thieves who stole art valued at up to $500 million from Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in 1990 they announced today in a stunning new development in the greatest art heist in modern history. Richard DesLauriers, the FBI's special agent in charge in Boston, said the thieves belong to a criminal organization based in New England, though did not offer any names. He added that authorities believe the art was taken to Connecticut and the Philadelphia region in the years after the theft, and offered for sale in Philadelphia about a decade ago. During the infamous heist, rare works from masters such as Rembrant, Degas, and Vermeer were stolen, sometimes cut from their frames. Scroll down for video . The empty frames from Rembrandt's 'Storm on the Sea of Galilee' and Vermeer's 'The Concert' remain on display in the museum as a constant physical reminder of the heist and the missing masterpieces .

Dutch Master: The thieves stole two Rembrandts -  'The Storm on the Sea of Galilee,' left, believed to be the only seascape the master painted, and 'A Lady and Gentleman in Black,' right . In progress: Left, Degas' Three Mounted Jockeys, and right, a self-portrait of Rembrandt . Most valuable: Jan Vermeer's The Concert is one of approximately 35 known works by the great Dutch painter . During the 1990 robbery, thieves . disguised as police officers struck as Boston finished celebrating St. Patrick's Day, binding two guards, before stealing masterworks by . Rembrandt, Vermeer, Degas and Manet. While the FBI has had several promising leads in the 23 years following the heist, no one was ever charged with stealing the works. According to an FBI release sent out today, investigators believe that the original thieves transported the stolen art to parts of Connecticut and Philadelphia. ‘Some of the art was taken to Philadelphia, where it was offered for sale by those responsible for the theft,’ DesLauriers said in a statement. ‘With that same confidence, we have identified the thieves, who are members of a criminal organization with a base in the Mid-Atlantic states and New England.’ At a loss: Left, a visitor looks at the empty frame from a Rembrandt work, and right, the museum in 1990 following the heist, the empty frame of Rembrandt's oil painting 'A Lady and Gentleman in Black' lies on the floor  and a space on the wall remains bare where his 'The Storm on the Sea of Galilee' once hung . Landscape: Govaert Flinck's 'Landscape with an Obelisk,' painted in 1638, was originally attributed to Rembrandt, but was later found to be the work of his assistant, Flinck . Heist of the century: The thieves also made off with Degas' 'La Sortie du Pelage,' a watercolor and pencil sketch . Black and white: Two Degas sketches from 1884, entitled 'Program for an Artistic Soirée' Monochrome: Degas'  'Cortège aux Environs de Florence' Proud: This bronze eagle-shaped finial from c. 1813 originally sat on the top of the pole support of a silk Napoleonic flag in the Short Gallery; the thieves likely thought it was gold . The FBI said that following an attempted sale of one of the works more than a decade ago, they could only piece together small bits of information on the whereabouts of the masterpieces – and the thieves. Because of the high-profile nature of the case, the government agency released as much information about the heist as they could, in hopes that someone would flag a suspicious art purchase. They also continue to highlight the $5 million, no-questions-asked reward. Announcement: Special Agent-in-Charge of the FBI's Boston Field Office Richard Des Lauriers, center, along with United States Attorney Carmen Ortiz, left, and Boston FBI Special Agent Geoff Kelly, right announce investigative developments today . Last year the FBI has actively offered a $5million reward to anyone who had information that led to the painting's safe return to the museum . Anthony Amore, who is the Gardner museum’s chief of security, said that anyone could claim the reward, even if they did not have the paintings. ‘We hope that through this media campaign, people will see how earnest we are in our attempts to pay this reward and make our institution whole,’ he said in a statement. When the thieves, disguised as two security officers, sneaked into the Boston institution, they cut some of the works of art right out of the frames. The empty frames continue to be hung in the museum as a constant physical reminder of the heist and the missing masterpieces. The thieves, once publically identified, will be prosecuted by a special FBI department, the Art Crime Team, which is comprised of 14 special agents. The team of agents, along with trial lawyers, investigates art theft, fraud, and lootings in both national and international scope.

Wearing the white Angela Kelly dress she chose for her Jubilee portrait, accompanied by Prince Philip in his . Royal Navy Uniform, and weighed down with heavy ceremonial . crowns and robes (as well as Queen Victoria's pearl earrings and Diamond Jubilee . necklace), the Queen unveiled 20 Bills which the coalition hopes to . pass into law in the next year. In line with Her Majesty's decision to give her son and heir a bigger role as 'co-head' of the Royal family, Prince Charles attended the event - a tradition which dates back to the 16th century -  for the first time in 17 years.

And . each year sees her wearing two of the most important pieces in the . Royal collection of jewels and clothing, both also worn for the . coronation: the Imperial State Crown and the Robe of the State. The Imperial State Crown - which includes 2,868 diamonds, 273 pearls, 17 sapphires, 11 emeralds, and 5 rubies, and weighs 2lb - is the most famous of all the British crowns, and was re-made for the coronation of the Queen's father, King George VI, in . 1937.

The 18ft-long Robe of the State is an ermine cape with crimson velvet train, weighing some 15lb. The current one was crafted by Ede and Ravenscroft in 1952 for the Queen's coronation, and the company's ledger reads: 'Parliamentary robe for Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in the best quality hand made crimson velvet, trimmed with gold lace in the traditional manner and lined throughout with finest coronation ermine.' But the Queen does not begin today's event wearing these items. Initially, during her horse-drawn procession from the palace to the Palace of Westminster with the Duke of Edinburgh, she wears the simpler George IV State Diadem. Prince Philip wears his Royal Navy uniform, as will the Prince of Wales who will join them with, for the first time, his wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. The Royal party follows the coach carrying the ceremonial regalia: the Imperial State Crown, the sword of state and the cap of maintenance, all symbols of the Monarch's authority. The coaches travel into Westminster through the Sovereign's Entrance, and crown then goes into the robing room, where it is fitted on the Queen, along with the Robe of State.

The Imperial State Crown was originally made for Queen Victoria’s coronation in 1838 by Rundell, Bridge & Rundell, the Crown Jewellers. At that time the Stuart Sapphire was in the front. Another sapphire (still in the Jewel House) was at the back. The Second Star of Africa (Cullinan II) replaced the Stuart Sapphire (which was moved to the back) in 1909. The crown was replicated for King George VI by Garrards in 1937 and the arches were lowered for Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. The crown is of traditional design of crosses pattée and fleurs-de-lis with four half-arches of oak-leaf design set with pearls and diamonds. It is fitted with a purple velvet cap turned over with ermine and is mounted in gold and silver. It weighs 2 pounds 13 ounces and is set with over 3000 precious stones. The more important are St Edward’s Sapphire, set in the cross pattée above the monde, Queen Elizabeth’s Pearls suspended below the monde, the Black Princes Ruby (a spinel) in the cross pattée above the band, the Second Star of Africa in the front of the band and the Stuart Sapphire in the band at the back.

Robe of the State . The Robe of the State is 18ft in length, weighs 15lb and has to be carried by helpers . The robe that is worn at the Coronation on entry to the Abbey, is also worn at the State Openings of Parliament. It consists of an ermine cape and a long crimson velvet train lined with further ermine and decorated with two rows of hand-made embroidered gold lace and gold filigree work. It weighs 15lb and measures 18ft in length. It is fitted onto the monarch's shoulders in the Robing Room inside the Palace of Westminster and then carried by sewn-in fabric hooks while she walks. The Robe went on public display for the first time as part of an exhibition at the summer opening of Buckingham Palace in 2010. The robe was made by Messrs. Ede and Ravenscroft of Chancery Lane, London. The velvet had been hand-woven by Warners of Braintree, Essex, from silk supplied by Lady Hart Dyke of Lullington Castle. George IV State Diadem is worn on the journey from Buckingham Palace to Westminster . George IV State Diadem . This was made by Rundell, Bridge & Rundell for the coronation of George IV to encircle the King’s velvet Cap of Estate, which he wore in procession to Westminster Abbey. As the Privy Council ruled that the crown could not bear roses, shamrocks and thistles, as the King wished, rather than the traditional fleurs-de-lis, the national symbols were instead incorporated in the Diadem. The diamonds hired for George IV’s coronation were later replaced by permanently-set jewels. Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth II each wore the Diadem for the processions to their coronations. The Queen also wears the Diadem when she travels to and from the State Opening of Parliaments and it features on all denominational postage stamps. It is composed of four diamond pavé-set crosses pattée alternating with four bouquets of rose, shamrock and thistle. The front cross pattée is set with a 4-carat canary-coloured diamond.  There are 1333 diamonds weighing 325.75 carats and 169 pearls. The diamond scrollwork band was remounted for Queen Alexandra in 1902. In 1991, The Queen agreed to allow the Diadem to be displayed with the Crown Jewels in the Tower of London.

"This is the heart-stopping moment a kayaker is rescued from drowning by his quick-thinking colleagues. During a trip down the Wilson Creek a National Wild and Scenic River located in the Pisgah National Forest near Collettesville, North Carolina, a kayaker toppled over and his head became pinned beneath the surface of his kayak. Without being able to break free, his head was trapped, but luckily nearby, kayakers Markham Shuskey, Corey Edwards, Jake Matheny, Michael Barbre, and Matt Dolian were out on the water that day. The kayaker is dragged to safety by the quick-thinking of his colleagues . The angle of the boat to the rocks meant his head was lodged in the flow of the water . Barbre and Dolian quickly went into action and managed to rescue the man in the nick of time. It all appears to be a routine paddle at the start of the video, but then muffled screams heard some yards behind lead the team of four to surge into action. The angle of the upturned kayak to the rocks mean the stricken man's head is trapped in the flow of the water, meaning breathing becomes impossible. The upturned kayak signals big danger for one unlucky thrill-seeker, and presents an emergency . Matt Dolian discards his kayak as he wades forward to help the stricken man . Although shallow waters, the position of the rocks make even this a difficult route to navigate . After a few tugs and somewhat of a struggle, the man is finally pulled out of the water, giving a relieved thumbs up. The pristine and rugged landscape of Wilson Creek make it hugely popular for kayaking, camping, hunting and fishing, waterfall hikes, off-road driving, and mountain biking.

"Australian aircraft engineers have called for Airbus A380 - the world's biggest passenger aircraft - to be grounded, after Singapore Airlines and Qantas found cracks in the wings of their super-jumbos. 'We can't continue to gamble with people's lives and allow those aircraft . to fly around and hope that they make it until their four-yearly . inspection,' said Steve Purvinas, secretary of the Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association. Both airlines, and Airbus, admitted that they had discovered cracks, but maintained that the aircraft were safe. In total, 67 Airbus A380s are in use worldwide, on seven airlines.The aircraft are in use by Qantas, Singapore Airlines, Emirates, Air France, Lufthansa, Korean Airlines and China Southern. Scrutiny: Airbus' new A380 superjumbo has come under fire again, after Singapore Airlines had to shut down an engine and return a flight to Singapore yesterday . 'We confirm that cracks were found on . non-critical wing attachments on a limited number of A380s,' an . Airbus spokesperson said today. 'We've traced the origin of these . hairline cracks, and developed an inspection and repair procedure which . can be done during routine maintenance.' Singapore Airlines, the world’s second-biggest . carrier, . operates 14 A380s already and has five on order, while Qantas has taken delivery . of 10 of its order of 20 A380 aircraft. The A380 has been in service for five years. It seats 525 passengers in a typical three-class arrangement. In total, 238 of the aircraft have been ordered by 17 airlines worldwide. The aeroplanes are assembled in Toulouse, but parts are built across Europe, with the wings being built in Broughton, Wales. Singapore Airlines (SIA) and Qantas Airways said on Friday they discovered cracks on the wing ribs of their Airbus A380s, but said the cracks pose no threat to safety and repairs have been carried out. The remarks came after Airbus said on Thursday that engineers discovered minor cracks in the wings of a 'limited number' of A380s, but said the cracks were not affecting the safety of the aircraft. 'Cracks were found on a small number of wing rib feet on an Airbus A380 during inspections in the second half of last year. These pose no safety issue and repairs were carried out on the aircraft,' SIA’s spokesman Nicholas Ionides said in an email. All good: Lufthansa say it has no problems with its A380 fleet and operations continue as normal . 'Repairs were subsequently carried out on a second aircraft. We have kept the relevant regulatory authorities fully informed and will be carrying out inspections and any necessary repairs on other A380s as they go in for routine checks,' he added. Qantas separately said that 'minuscule cracking' was found in the wing ribs of the Qantas A380 being repaired in Singapore after one of its Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines suffered a mid-air blowout in 2010. 'Investigations have found that the cracking is unrelated to the engine failure incident experienced by this aircraft in November 2010 and is not unique to Qantas. It has now been repaired,' the carrier said in a statement. 'No immediate action is required by A380 operators because the cracking presents no risk whatsoever to flight safety,' Qantas said. A Lufthansa spokesman said: ‘There is no findings on our . side and we have normal operations.’ Airbus said it has traced the origin of the problem and developed an inspection and repair procedure that will be done during routine, scheduled four-year maintenance checks. SIA, the world’s second-biggest carrier by market value and the first operator of such aircraft, operates 14 A380s and has five on order, while Qantas has taken delivery of 10 of its 20 A380 aircraft on order, according to the airline’s website.

"A Star Wars actor is facing jail after he admitted exposing himself on a train for the second time. Nicholas Read, 41, flashed at a student on a train to Manchester and took a picture of her horrified friend using a mobile phone. At the time of the offence the 4ft 5in star had just enrolled on a sex offenders’ treatment programme for a similar crime. Facing jail: Star Wars act Nicholas Read (left, pictured arriving at Leicester Crown Court in July 2011) who played an Ewok in Star Wars: Episode VI - Return Of The Jedi (stock image) Read - who appeared as an Ewok in Return of the Jedi, and a goblin in Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, has now been warned he could be locked up. He admitted exposure on January 21, at a Manchester Crown Court plea hearing. The court heard that back in October 2010, Read sat next to a schoolgirl on a London to Leicester train and performed a sex act under a juggler’s hat for half an hour. His latest offence puts him in breach of the 20-week suspended sentence he was given for that offence. Repeat offender: Nicholas Read, 41, (left) flashed at a student on a train to Manchester and took a picture of her horrified pal using a mobile phone (file picture) He is now at risk of going to jail for the 20 weeks, in addition to the punishment for his latest offence, and will be sentenced on July 13. Judge Roger Thomas QC, warned him: 'The bottom line is you are in breach of a suspended sentence. 'The normal consequence of that is to prison you go and that may well have to be the outcome. 'But this is an unusual sort of case and the judge will be informed by the Probation Service about what’s been going on over the last 12 months, and what sort of risk you pose hereafter.' The judge refused a request by Rachel Faux, defending, for a psychiatric report to be prepared on Read, saying there was 'very little' evidence of mental illness in his case. Roles: Read played a goblin in the film Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone, starring Daniel Radcliffe, right (stock image) But the probation service will prepare a report before Read is sentenced and there may yet be a psychiatric report if it is found to be necessary following that interview. Read is barred from using the rail network except for the purposes of attending court or visiting his solicitor. He was ordered to sign the sex offenders’ register on the date of his last conviction for exposure. Read, of Wade Close, Cheadle, Staffordshire, has a number of sex offences on a criminal record dating back to 1995. He has previously been convicted of making lewd phone calls to women.","Nicholas Read appeared as an Ewok in Return of the Jedi, and a goblin in Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone .

"New Yorkers have reacted furiously to Russell Brand's admission that he is 'open-minded' about whether the United States was behind the 9/11 attacks. The comedian, 39, said in a BBC Newsnight interview he believes there is an 'interesting' relationship between the families of former US president George Bush and Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and asked: 'Do you trust the American government?' Brand was pressed by presenter Evan Davis on comments in his new book, Revolution, because in it he describes the 9/11 attacks on the Twin Towers in New York as 'controlled'. New Yorker Ryan Nugent, 31, said: 'It's an insensitive thing to say. I had friends who were in the tower, luckily they were OK, but we only recently had our moment of silence. 'It was extremely tough and sad for people in this city. And it still is. 'He needs to talk about something that you can factually prove. There is no evidence to suggest this happened. It's weak from him and he is only trying to create buzz for his book.' Scroll down for video . Flamboyant: Russell Brand, pictured on Newsnight last night, caused controversy after he said he was 'open-minded' about whether the United States was involved in 9/11 . Outspoken: Brand accused the presenter Evan Davis of leading him 'down blind alleys about silly administrative quibbles' when taken to task over his new book . Local John Greco said: 'He is just trying to get publicity for his book. I don't really listen to what he has to say.' Brand's decision to give credence to a 9/11 conspiracy on Thursday night led to immediate outrage both online and from those who knew, or were related to, people killed in the terrorist attack. The multi-millionaire, who was married to Katy Perry, was branded a 'ranting idiot' who should 'stick to comedy'. New Yorker Kathryn Kolocuh, 22, said she 'felt sorry' for him and believed he was being paranoid. Another said: 'It's a silly, ridiculous thing to say. Just sounds like he is being incendiary to promote his book.' Responding to criticism that Brand was on Newsnight again, the BBC, who had nine complaints, said: 'Love him or loathe him Russell Brand has been one of the most eloquent voices articulating the anti-politics mood that all British politicians are currently struggling to engage with'. Rant: Brand also accused the BBC of pursuing subtly building 'an anti-Islamic narrative' while reporting the Ottawa terror attack this week . Conspiracy theorists have said that rather than being brought down by terrorists, the United States plotted to demolish them with explosives to help spark a war in Iraq. Charlie Sheen . Fellow hellraiser Charlie Sheen argues that hijackers could never have carried out the 9/11 attacks. He said: 'It seems to me like 19 amateurs with box cutters taking over four commercial airliners and hitting 75 per cent of their targets, that feels like a conspiracy theory. It raises a lot of questions.' David Icke . Icke believes that the world is being run by a race of child-sacrificing, shape-shifting, reptilian aliens — and thousands of people seem to believe him. He was forced to flee the spotlight 20 years ago — after he declared on a BBC chat show that he was the son of God. The TV star from the 1980s, and his followers that the Babylonian Brotherhood runs the world and the Queen and George W Bush are among the race of reptiles and this elite group organised terror attacks like 9/11 and the Oklahoma bombing. When asked about a 9/11 conspiracy Brand said: 'We have to remain open-minded to any kind of possibility. 'Do you trust the American government? Do you trust the British government? What I do think is very interesting is the relationship that the Bush family have had for a long time with the bin Laden family. 'What I do think is very interesting is the way that even the BBC report the events in Ottawa to subtly build an anti-Islamic narrative. I think that's very interesting.' He then appeared abruptly to change tack, saying that he did not want to discuss 'daft' conspiracy theories. Brand has courted controversy over 9/11 in the past and was sacked by MTV after turning up for work dressed as Osama bin Laden on the day after the attack that killed 3,000 people. In his autobiography he described being around colleagues on September 12 as: 'And there's me standing beside them, still dressed as Osama bin Laden. I thought: ""It don't get any better than this."" Twitter users were left furious by his Newsnight performance, many considering it insulting to the nearly 3,000 dead, which included 67 Britons. The devastating attacks on the Twin Towers 13 years ago changed the world. Questioning: The comedian was asked about 9/11 because his book refers to the terror attack being 'controlled' The BBC came under fire last night for giving Russell Brand a platform on Newsnight to say the US government may have been behind the 9/11 terror attacks. Bosses on the show devoted seven more minutes to Brand’s bizarre musings than to the coverage of the deadly spread of Ebola across Western Africa. The interview – which took up more than a third of the entire programme – lasted as long as a piece on a key report into the state of the NHS in England. Last night Tory MP Philip Davies condemned the BBC for giving Brand a platform. He said: ‘I’ve no idea what the BBC are up to. If they think that the general public want to see this kind of nonsense on a serious political news programme they need to get out more. ‘It is bewildering why they have given Russell Brand a platform to display such ignorant views. One might wonder what expertise he brings to this subject. The answer is none. The BBC have taken leave of their senses.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘Love him or loathe him, Russell Brand has been one of the most eloquent voices articulating the anti-politics mood politicians are struggling to engage with.’ Brand will appear on the Jonathan Ross Show tonight to promote his book – six years after the pair faced a storm of criticism for calling actor Andrew Sachs so Brand could boast of having had sex with his granddaughter. More than 1,100 people have never been identified, and their remains have been placed in a tomb under New York's Memorial Museum. The al Qaeda plot also included the crashing of two more aircraft, one into the Pentagon, in Washington DC, and the other a field in Pennsylvania. In the tense interview Brand said the BBC 'shamefully sabotaged' the Scottish Referendum for the No campaign and Mr Davis he was 'mates with like CEOs and big businesses' and spent time 'cosying up' to London mayor Boris Johnson. When Mr Davis pressed him about his views he shouted over the presenter: 'Mate, I don't want to follow you down blind alleys about silly administrative quibbles.' At one point Mr Davis pleaded: 'I'm trying to take you seriously.' Davis then tried to show the actor a graph showing wage levels in Britain, but he responded: 'I don't want to look at a graph mate, I haven't got time to look at a bloody graph. 'It's a lovely graph mate, well done. This is the kind of thing that people like you use to confuse people like us.' After the show Twitter users started sending graphs to Brand to lampoon him over the outburst. He replied: 'Cheers for the graphs.The 5 richest families in UK have as much money as the poorest 12 million people. Do us one for that'. Track record: Russell Brand was on Newsnight in 2013 where urged people not to vote because it 'changes nothing' Tragedy: Almost 3,000 people were killed when terrorists crashed two hijacked planes into the Twin Towers 13 years ago . It was Brand's second appearance on Newsnight after a now notorious interview with Jeremy Paxman, where the comedian said he had never voted because he regarded politicians as untrustworthy and irrelevant. The multi-millionaire also said that 'profit is a dirty word', in response the the Prime Minister who said it wasn't. He has been a regular on the BBC despite his acrimonious departure in 2008. Brand and presenter Jonathan Ross left a series of obscene messages on Mr Sachs’s answerphone during Brand’s Radio 2 programme. The incident provoked 42,000 complaints after Brand boasted of sleeping with Mr Sachs’s granddaughter and joked that the 83-year-old former Fawlty Towers star might hang himself as a result of the phone calls. Brand later resigned while Ross was suspended. Brand later claimed many of the 42,000 people who complained to the BBC either had no real idea of what they were complaining about or were motivated by an anti-BBC agenda. He has starred in several high profile Hollywood movies, most notably Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Get Him to the Greek, and commands a high acting fee. He is also famous in the UK for his work on television, radio and as a stand up comedian. His net worth is believed to be more than £15million, with rumours this doubled following his divorce from singer Katy Perry.

"The secret to staying slim could be in saliva. Researchers have found that a gene that makes a carb-busting compound has a large influence on weight. Nicknamed the Atkins Gene in some quarters after the popular diet, its official scientific nickname is AMY1. The gene makes an enzyme that is found in saliva and begins the breakdown and digestion of starchy foods like chips, crisps and rice. Carbohydrates: Researchers have found that a gene that makes an enzyme found in saliva begins the breakdown of starchy food and can have a large influence on weight . The study showed that people who had more copies of the gene made more of the enzyme and were more likely to be slim. Although we normally think of genes as coming in pairs, some people will only have one copy of a gene.  Others will have two, three or even more. In the case of the AMY1 gene, it possible to have up to 20 copies. Those who had fewer copies would be likely to find carbohydrates more difficult to digest - and therefore more likely to put on weight the journal Nature Genetics reports. Nickname: The AMY1 gene has been nicknamed the Atkins Gene after the popular diet devised by Dr Robert Atkins (pictured) It is not clear why.  But one possibility is that the undigested starch is feasted on by gut bacteria that fuel obesity by tinkering with the metabolism. The researchers, from King’s College London and Imperial College London, said that future dietary advice may have to be tailored to a person’s digestive system. Professor Tim Spector, the study’s joint lead author, said: ‘These findings are very exciting. ‘The next step is to find out more about the activity of this digestive enzyme and whether this might prove a useful marker or target for the treatment of obesity. ‘In the future, a simple blood or saliva test might be used to measure levels of key enzymes such as amylase in the body and therefore shape dietary advice for both overweight and underweight people. ‘Treatments are a long way away but this is an important step in realising that all of us digest and metabolise food differently – and we can move away from ‘one-size fits all diets’ to more personalised approaches.'","AMY1 gene makes a carb-busting compound and can influence weight .

"The cities of the future will be covered in 'glow-in-the-dark dust' and fed by 'urban farms' growing both on and inside buildings, according to a new report. Spray-on light absorbing dust would give . public buildings, roads and pathways a phosphorescent shine at night, . helping to improve the safety of parks and alleyways. Even trees could be made to glow in the dark by splicing bioluminescent genes into their trunks and branches, say experts at Arup, the engineering and design consultancy behind London's Garden Bridge project - which hopes to build a new footbridge and public garden spanning the Thames linking South Bank to Temple . Engineering firm Arup thinks spray-on light absorbing dust would give public buildings, roads and pathways a phosphorescent shine at night, as pictured in this artist's impression . The spray-on dust and glowing trees would make street lighting less necessary, thus reducing the carbon footprint of urban centres, making them more environmentally friendly. Designers and engineers at Arup looked at ways of protecting urban areas and improving the lives of city dwellers in a world transformed by global warming and growing populations. The report highlights natural solutions such as preventing flooding by replacing hard concrete and tarmac with permeable surfaces, and increasing tree cover. To meet the increasing demand for food, vertical 'urban farms' are also forecast with crops being grown in and on city buildings. Glowing: Trees could be made to glow in the dark by splicing bioluminescent genes into their trunks and branches, say experts at  engineering and design consultancy Arup . Parks could also contribute to food supplies by providing places where people can forage for fruits, edible greenery and even insects. 'By 2050, it is predicted that the human population will have reached nine billion with 75per cent of people living in cities,' said Arup's landscape architecture group leader Tom Armour. 'Adaptations to existing city spaces, enabled by rapid technological innovation, will serve as major catalysts in the shift toward increasing sustainability, resilience and adaptability in dense urban environments.' Increasing the number of green spaces in cities was expected to increase life expectancy by up to five years by encouraging people to take more exercise. Absence from work through sickness was also likely to be reduced. Research has shown that people who work in buildings overlooking parkland took almost a quarter less time off than those with no green views. Growing green: Plant-covered high-rise city blocks could help increase life expectancy and reduce absences at work through sickness, according to the report by Arup . Increased demand: Vertical urban farms would help provide food for the growing city populations . Pro-Teq, a UK company based in Virginia Water, Surrey, already produces a product called Starpath that can be sprayed on any solid surface to make it glow in the dark. The coating contains particles that harvest the sun's rays during the day and emit a soft blue light at night. 'Starpath has the potential to reduce the need for complex lighting installations in parks and alleyways while allowing for the introduction of lighting and the safety and security that brings,' said the Arup report. 'Another benefit is that since it's non-reflective and relatively low intensity, it doesn't add to light pollution.' A public footpath constructed with Starpath is currently being tested in Christ's Pieces park in Cambridge.","Spray-on light absorbing dust would make roads and pathways glow at night .

"Marks and Spencer has admitted exposing one of its workers to asbestos, which led to her developing a terminal lung cancer. Janice Allen, 53, worked in the flagship store on Oxford Street in the 1970s and 1980s. Last year she was diagnosed with mesothelioma, an incurable cancer linked to inhaling asbestos. Mrs Allen, who has been given just months to live, says she feels betrayed and that the store 'ruined her life' by exposing her to the deadly chemical. Scroll down for video . Victim: Janice Allen, pictured at home, was diagnosed with deadly mesothelioma last year . Terminal: Doctors have told Mrs Allen that she only has months to live . Asbestos which was used in a huge number of buildings between the 1950s and 1970s, but was outlawed after its links to deadly illnesses became clear. Marks and Spencer admitted negligently exposing Mrs Allen to the substance while she worked at the Oxford Street store and another outlet in Uxbridge, West London. After admitting liability at the High Court in London, Marks and Spencer agreed to pay 'significant' damages, and agreed an undisclosed figure with Mrs Allen outside of court. After the settlement, Mrs Allen, whose husband Stuart also worked for Marks and Spencer, said the company 'betrayed' her. She said: 'I wish that I hard never worked for Marks and Spencer at all , that I had never known them.When I worked for them I was proud to work for them - I was in the premier store. Long service: Mrs Allen spent years working at the flagship Marks and Spencer store in Oxford Street, London . 'Now I wish that I'd never, ever worked for them because they've ruined my life. 'I felt betrayed, really. I worked hard for them... I can't explain how angry it made me feel that they had such disregard for the safety of their staff.' The case is thought to be the first victory for a Marks and Spencer employee who only ever worked on the shop floor, as opposed to staff such as builders and electricians who had direct contact. Her case is thought to be the first . in which judgment has been . given in court for a Marks and Spencer employee who was exposed to . asbestos by simply working on the shop floor, as opposed to industrial . contractors or electricians who came into direct contact with the . substance. Beginnings: Mrs Allen, pictured left and right, started working at the store when she was a teenager. It was there she met her husband, Stuart, centre right . Leigh Day, the . law firm which acted for Mrs Allen, has voiced concerns that many more . workers could have contracted the deadly cancer through their working . life. Mesothelioma is a cancer of membrane cells which line major organs. It occurs most often in tissue around the lungs. Symptoms of the disease include acute chest pains, such as Mrs Allen suffered, a persistent cough and difficulty breathing, high temperatures and weight loss. More than 2,500 people are diagnosed with mesothelioma every year, with five times more men than women falling victim. According to the NHS, the disease is 'almost always' caused by asbestos, and takes 20 to 60 years to develop after the initial exposure. The cancer can be difficult to diagnose accurately, as affected cells do not look distinctive. Chemotherapy is the main treatment. Some surgical procedures are being investigated, but remain unproven. Because mesothelioma is so difficult to diagnose, it is often terminal by the time doctors notice. Patients rarely survive more than three years after diagnosis. The average is 12 months. Some 2,300 per year die of the disease, though experts expect this to increase as more workers exposed to asbestos in past decades are affected. By 2050, it is thought the cancer will have taken 90,000 lives. Harminder Bains, a solicitor at Leigh Day, said: 'It can take as long as 40 years for exposure to asbestos to manifest in those who have inhaled asbestos'. The . case was aided by evidence from William Wallace, a Health and Safety . Officer who had informed the HSE of the criminally unsafe work with . asbestos at Marks and Spencer’s Reading branch, as a result of which the company was fined £1million. Mr Wallace also worked at the Marble Arch store in 1998, and acted as a witness in Allen's legal claim. He told the High Court: 'There . were minefields – asbestos minefields, for want of a better expression. You could not have guaranteed the safety of anybody – the workers, the . staff, the customers. You could not have given a 100 per cent guarantee . that those people were safe'. A Marks and Spencer spokesman claimed the company could not comment on individual cases, but extended 'deepest sympathies' to Mrs Allen. She also insisted that its stores are no longer dangerous. The spokesman said: 'This is an historic case and relates to times of exposure that pre-date the banning of asbestos, when the consequences of its everyday use were still unknown. 'We had very clear policies in place that were the best they could be based on the knowledge of the time - but like other retailers and organisations with a large property portfolio dating back to the post war era, M&S will be subject to asbestos claims. 'We are confident that we now have the most rigorous policy we can have in place and that M&S stores are safe for our employees and our customers.'","Janice Allen, 53, worked on Oxford Street for the store in the 1970s and 80s .

"Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, head of the Islamic State or Iraq and the Levant, has released a 19-minute video calling on Muslims to build an 'Islamic state' The leader of extremist group ISIS has called on Muslims to come to the territory his group has seized to help build an Islamic state, declaring: 'The earth is Allah's.' Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, head of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, said in a 19-minute audiotape released online yesterday: 'Muslims, rush to your state. Yes, it is your state.' In the audio, posted on militant websites which have been used by the group before, the leader makes a special call to those with practical skills - such as scholars, judges, doctors, engineers and people with military and administrative expertise - to come 'answer the dire need of the Muslims for them'. Urging Muslims around the world to travel to the Middle East to join the Islamic state, al-Baghdadi goes on to say: 'Rush, because Syria is not for the Syrians and Iraq is not for the Iraqis'. He also calls on jihadi fighters to increase fighting in the holy month of Ramadan, which began on Sunday. He . said: 'In this virtuous month or in any other month, there is no deed . better than jihad in the path of Allah, so take advantage of this . opportunity and walk the path of you righteous predecessors. 'So to arms, to arms, soldiers of the Islamic, fight, fight.' The tape was released online two days after the organisation unilaterally declared the establishment of an Islamic state, or caliphate, in the land it controls, changing its name to the Islamic State. It also proclaimed al-Baghdadi the caliph - the head of state in a caliphate - and demanded that all Muslims around the world pledge allegiance to him. The voice resembled that on other audiotapes said to be by al-Baghdadi, an Iraqi militant who has rarely been photographed or appeared in public. Meanwhile, claims have emerged that ISIS militants, which are continuing to advance in Syria, are in possession of a massive long-distance ballistic missile. Missile: Photographs show a large weapon being paraded on the back on a lorry surrounded by masked men in the Syrian city of Raqqa - the proclaimed capital of the new Sunni Muslim caliphate . Mystery: It is not known how the weapon ended up in the hands of ISIS, but social media accounts linked to militants fighting for the group in Iraq and Syria claimed they are now preparing it for use . Announcement: ISIS militants (pictured) are celebrating the establishment of a caliphate, or Islamic state, in the vast stretches of the Middle East that have fallen under its control . Upon declaring a caliphate, the Sunni militants - whose brutality in attempting to establish control in Iraq and Syria has been branded too extreme even by Al Qaeda - demanded allegiance from Muslims around the world . Photographs . show a large weapon being paraded on the back on a lorry surrounded by . masked men in the Syrian city of Raqqa - the proclaimed capital of the . new Sunni Muslim caliphate. Supporters . of the jihadist group said the missile . was a Scud, although experts analysing the images believe the weapon is . almost certainly inoperable and highly unlikely to pose a threat. The leader made a special call to those with practical skills to 'answer the dire need of the Muslims for them' The weapon pictured being paraded by ISIS militants in Raqqa is believed to have been captured from another rebel group, the Free Syrian Army. The FSA are understood to have acquired the Soviet-built missile when it captured a military base from government forces in the Deir ez-Zor region of Syria last September. It is not known how the weapon ended up in the hands of ISIS, but social media accounts linked to militants fighting for the group in Iraq and Syria claimed they are now preparing it for use. 'Dawla Islamiyya (The Islamic State) has SCUD missile in #Raqqa. [God willing] its heading towards #Israel for a spectacular Eid ul fitr,' an ISIS suspporter calling himself Ansar Udeen said on Twitter. A number of experts have poured cold water on the idea that the missile could be a threat, however. Elliot Nelson, a blogger who tracks munitions used in Syria, tweeted: 'The only danger that Islamic State scud is to anyone at the moment is if they accidentally run over a pedestrian showing it off.' Meanwhile Charles Lister - an expert on the Syrian conflict who works at the at the Brookings Doha Center research organisation - called the missile 99 per cent useless, according to the Telegraph. This morning, Iraq's newly elected members of parliament attended their first government . session in Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone. The new parliament ended its inaugural session by failing to make any . progress in choosing a new prime minister - even as the country faces a . militant blitz that threatens to rip it apart. World leaders and senior clerics have urged Iraq's fractious politicians . to unite in the face of the militant onslaught, which has killed more . than 2,000 people, displaced hundreds of thousands and polarised the . country's Shiite, Sunni and Kurdish populations. New era: News that ISIS had declared its territory a caliphate was described by one expert, Charles Lister, as 'the most significant development in international jihadism since 9/11 . Caliphate: A map purportedly showing the areas ISIS plans to have under its control within five years has been widely shared online. As well as the Middle East, North Africa and large areas of Asia, it also reveals ISIS' ambition to extend into Europe. Spain, which was Muslim-ruled until the late 15th Century, would form part of the caliphate, as would the Balkan states and eastern Europe, up to and including Austria . Extremist: A gun-brandishing Islamist  loyal to ISIS celebrates the formation  of the Islamic State by waving an jihadist flag in the Syrian city of Raqqa on Sunday. The area is considered the capital of the Islamic State . Iraq's newly elected members of parliament attend their first government session in the heavily fortified Green Zone in Baghdad this morning . Iraq's new parliament ended its inaugural session today by failing to make any progress in choosing a new prime minister - even as the country faces a militant blitz that threatens to rip it apart . On Sunday ISIS declared they had changed their name to the Islamic State and announced that the areas of Iraq and Syria under their control represent the establishment of a caliphate. The news was described by Mr Lister as the 'most significant development in international jihadism since 9/11'. Upon declaring a caliphate, the Sunni . militants - whose brutality in attempting to establish control in Iraq . and Syria has been branded too extreme even by Al Qaeda - demanded . allegiance from Muslims around the world. With brutal efficiency, ISIS has carved . out a large chunk of territory that has effectively erased the border . between Iraq and Syria and laid the foundations of its proto-state. Now that it feels it has secure the territory under its control, the group announced it would be changing its name from the Islamic State of Iraq and Sham (also known as the Levant), to just the Islamic State, in order to appear less regional. A . spokesman for ISIS declared the group's chief, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, as . the leader of the new caliphate and called on . Muslims everywhere, not just those in areas under the organization's . control, to swear loyalty to him. 'The . legality of all emirates, groups, states and organizations becomes null . by the expansion of the caliph's authority and the arrival of its . troops to their areas,' said Abu Mohammed al-Adnani. 'Listen to your caliph and obey him. Support your state, which grows every day,' he added in an audio statement posted online.

"Chinese students are furious after university officials killed a dog which had become a campus mascot after it started attending lectures. Casper the dog would regularly sit in on English and calculus at the Northwest A&F University in Yanglin County in the city of Xi'an, in north-western China's Shaanxi province. The story of Casper began to circulate in local media and on social networks, however university officials did not appreciate the attention, and poisoned the dog. RIP Casper: Casper the dog would sit in on lectures at Northwest A&F University in north-west China and had become a mascot for students . University officials have been accused of having Casper killed as his presence during lectures was damaging its reputation as one of the top universities in China. Student Xiong Hou, 21, said: 'It was felt the dog had a really good influence on people, and as far as I know none of the lecturers objective. 'Sometimes they would joke that only the dog was paying attention. I think he liked the English classes and calculus because the seats were best there for him to sleep on. 'But when he didn't turn up at the canteen at midday which he usually did to get food with the rest of us, somebody was horrified to see his body in the bin.

The spokesman said: 'We cannot tolerate strays on the campus as they make a mess and also pose a risk that they might bite someone, which ultimately means it's our responsibility.' Another student at the University, Xiao Wang, 23, added: 'It wasn't necessary to kill Casper, he would sit all day long in classes so he was hardly a threat to anyone. 'They were just embarrassed that he made them look unprofessional. But actually I think having a pet in the class is actually progressive and forward-thinking.

"Being on the Mediterranean coastline, Gibraltar is quite a windy place. So on their royal visit to the former colony yesterday, Sophie, Countess of Wessex unwittingly ended up revealing more than usual of her legs when her dress was lifted up by the wind.

Good weather: Despite the wind, the couple have been blessed with sunny weather during their stay . For the couple's busy day, former PR Sophie wore three different outfits, and was expected to have changed into a fourth for her evening engagements. For their visit to the Botanical Gardens and the Naval Base, where a Royal Air Force plane perform a flypast, the mother-of-two wore a black and white optical illusion shift dress. She later changed into a green and white fern-patterned dress with beige jacket and matching hat for a parade in honour of the Queen. The Queen's image was projected on to the iconic rock, beside an image of the Union flag, prompting raised eyebrows among the Spanish media because, due to where it was placed, the sight could only be seen from Spanish soil. Spaniard Antonio Jimenez, 40, draped himself in the Spanish flag as he watched from the nearby Playa de Levante. He said: 'It's an act of provocation. It's a political act, a conflict which serves no purpose for the people who live either side of the border.'

"The mother of a teenager with autism has been charged with attempted murder as police believe she tried killing herself and her daughter. Kelli Stapleton, 45, is expected to be arraigned in the coming days after her release Thursday from a Grand Rapids, Michigan hospital where she was treated for carbon monoxide poisoning following the failed suicide attempt. In a statement released, her husband Matt said their daughter Isabelle remains hospitalized in critical condition and unconscious after suffering carbon monoxide poisoning. Police said she and her daughter were found Tuesday after having suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning. Scroll down for video . Mother and child: Kelli Stapleton, left, was found alongside her daughter Isabelle, right, just hours after her husband reported them missing and they were both unconscious . Mrs Stapleton had been vocal in the difficulties her family faced in treating her daughter’s autism, and kept a blog chronicling their efforts that was titled ‘The Status Woe’. Isabelle is being treated at a Grand Rapids children's hospital. Matt Stapleton had reported his wife and their oldest daughter missing Tuesday afternoon after receiving a phone message from Kelli and discovering the van was gone from their home in Elberta, a small community along Lake Michigan and about 30 miles west of Traverse City. 'He took that as a disconcerting message... despondent,' Belcher said. After police found the van, mother and daughter were rushed to a hospital in Traverse and later moved to Grand Rapids for specialized care. Can't forgive: Issy's father Matt Stapleton, right, has opened up about his wife's actions last September . Kelli Stapleton was taken Thursday to the Benzie County Jail while her daughter is still in doctors care. ‘(Isabelle) is currently receiving help from a respirator and breathing tube, and her blood pressure is stable,' Matt Stapleton wrote about his daughter in his email to media. 'At this time, she is still unresponsive after being lifted from the medically induced coma she was put in for the treatment of her injuries.' Earlier this year, the family told the Traverse City Record-Eagle about their struggles with medical insurance and state and local agencies as they sought care for their then-13-year-old daughter. They said her acute autism at times led to violent outbursts from Isabelle. Kelli Stapleton was injured and hospitalized twice. Special needs: Mrs Stapleton documented her daughter's struggles on her blog, posting videos of them playing . The couple said a center for autism training and research near Kalamazoo told them their daughter could need as much as eight months of treatment to decrease her aggressive behavior, but the financial cost would be high. Isabelle was put into a month-long program at the center in January. Help: Kelli, seen here saying her nightly prayers with Isabelle, said that her daughter can be extremely aggressive . 'She is a great kid with a lot of potential,' Kelli Stapleton told the newspaper. 'She's so smart. She started reading when she was 2. She's got so much to offer, but her aggression is going to limit her life as much as anything.' Isabelle's outbursts primarily were targeted at her mother and younger sister. An older brother and her father missed most of it. 'When I was home ... I'd be with her most of the time because of the aggressive nature,' Matt Stapleton told the newspaper. 'By the end, I was as much of a target as anybody. Of course, I can defend myself a little differently. 'She's gotten to that point where she can't help herself. She's hurting herself and she's hurting others. She'll always be autistic and she'll always be with us, but unless we're able to get some help for some of these behaviors she has, I don't even know how to predict how the next 20 years will look like.' 'If she was permanently broken, maybe we could have given up at some point. But she's really not,' Kelli told the Record-Eagle.","Kelli Stapleton is accused of trying to kill herself and her 14-year-old daughter Isabelle who has an acute form of autism .

"The White House revealed today that cyber attackers linked to the Chinese government attempted to hack into a computer system in the White House Military Office. While the official statement down played the attack, saying that it was aiming for an unclassified 'isolated' network, one report claimed that the hackers targeted the White House Military Office which safeguards sensitive data like the nuclear launch codes. 'This was a spear phishing attack against an unclassified network. These types of attacks are not infrequent and we have mitigation measures in place,' a White House official told MailOnline. Spear phishing is a common form of hacking where a cyber attacker will send an email to it's target and hope that the recipient clicks on the links of downloads the attachments enclosed in the email in order to allow their malicious software to infiltrate the recipient's computer and data. White House officials confirmed that a hackers did try to 'phish' into the Military Office server but said there was no damage done . 'In this instance the attack was . identified, the system was isolated, and there is no indication . whatsoever that any exfiltration of data took place. Moreover, there was . never any impact or attempted breach of any classified system,' the . White House official continued. A conservative newspaper that has been regularly critical of the Obama administration, called The Washington Free Beacon, first published the report on Sunday and said that the attackers were linked to the Chinese government. They wrote that the attack, which allegedly occurred earlier in September, was yet another example of the 'failure of the Obama administration to press China on its persistent cyber attacks'. In response to the article, an unnamed White House official contacted Politico to clarify the story, saying that while the 'attempted' hack did take place, it did not cause any damage because the targeted system did not contain any sensitive data. The breach occurred using a 'spear phishing' tactic, in which a hacker sends uses common phrases or inviting subject lines to draw the recipient in and attract their attention in hope of gaining access ot their computer. Sensitive: The Military Office, which was targeted in the attack, is in charge of securing the 'nuclear football' which is the black briefcase (pictured) that contains the nuclear launch codes . Once those steps are taken- and it is . unclear whether they were in this case- the links or attachments enable . the hacker to download their malicious software, also known as malware. While the attacks on government officials provides the greatest risk in the political realm, private American businesses have also been the target of Chinese hackers. In November 2011, the National Counterintelligence Executive released a report detailing the extent of damage done by Chinese and Russian hackers on various companies. One example was that of a paint company called Valspar Corportation, which had a number of its proprietary paint formulas stolen. The move cost the company $20million. Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronics manufacturer that produces products sold in America including iPhones, was hacked in February by a group called Swagg Security which then obtained and released the email and credit card data for banking information for American companies including Apple and Microsoft. The state-run Medicaid system in Utah was hacked last month, prompting calls for tightened security around any government health databases that would be implemented in accordance with the Affordable Care Act. Administrators claimed that no personal medical data was removed from the site but it was not operational for ten days. Though the political slant of the Free . Beacon reporting is clear, it is also true that this is not the first . time that Chinese hackers have gotten unnervingly close to White House . communications. The New York Times reported . that in June 2011, Google and FBI officials confirmed that a . wide-ranging phishing attack had taken place after the hackers had . directed malware towards the personal Gmail accounts of an unknown . number of White House staffers. The FBI never released the names, or even t he number of staffers who were thought to be targeted in the attack. In the latest hacking, however, the target was much more clear and focused solely on the White House Military Office. The Military Office is in charge of arranging the President's travel, coordinating inter-office conference calls between top government officials, and most notably the security of the so-called 'nuclear football', the nickname for the suitcase that contains and controls all of the nuclear launch codes. The Free Beacon, which Politico points out published a story about a Russian submarine trolling in North American waters which was flatly denied by numerous government agencies, says a breach in this office would be devastating to the country's security.  'This is the most sensitive office in the U.S. government,' an unidentified former U.S. intelligence official told the paper. 'A compromise there would cause grave strategic damage to the United States.' The threat of a damaging cyber attack has raised the alarm in the highest levels of government, as President Obama penned an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal last year pushing for more dedication to digital security. 'So far, no one has managed to seriously damage or disrupt our critical infrastructure networks. But foreign governments, criminal syndicates and lone individuals are probing our financial, energy and public safety systems every day,' he wrote.","White House confirmed the hack but downplayed it, saying no damage was done and it was unsuccessful .

"A female IRA bomber who implicated Gerry Adams in the murder of suspected 'traitor' Jean McConnell has been found dead at her home. Mother-of-two Dolours Price, one of the militants who bombed the Old Bailey in 1973, died of a suspected drug overdose in Malahide, north Dublin. The 62-year-old  had in recent years been an outspoken critic of the Sinn Fein President, who has always denied ever being a member of the IRA. Found dead: IRA Old Bailey bomber Dolours Price, pictured in 2010, was found dead in her home in Malahide in north Dublin on Wednesday night . Jailed: Price, pictured left in 1989, was sentenced to life in prison for her role in the bomb attack on the Old Bailey courthouse in 1973. But the mother-of-two was freed after eight years . Carnage: The scene after an IRA bomb exploded outside the Old Bailey in central London in 1973 which killed one person and injured 200 people . Allegations: . Price - an outspoken critic of the peace process - accused Sinn Fein . President Gerry Adams, who has always denied ever having been a member . of the IRA, of sanctioning the Old Bailey court attack . She accused Mr Adams of personally . ordering the abduction of several of the 'disappeared' - people the IRA believed to be . traitors in the 1970s. They included Belfast mother-of-10 Mrs McConville, a Catholic who comforted a British soldier. Dead: An allegation was made that Jean McConville was killed by the 'unknowns' squad . Mrs McConville, a 37-year-old widow, was shot in the head in 1972. Price alleged that she was given the task of driving Mrs McConville away from her 10 children in the Divis flats complex to her death . on the Co Louth coast. Her body was found more than three decades later on a beach in County Louth. In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph last year, Price said: 'I . never knew for sure their ultimate end. 'I was simply told by Gerry Adams to take the people away, a couple of . lads or whatever. Some I knew their fate, some I didn't.' Price was found by family members at her home on Wednesday night. A garda spokesman said her death is not being treated as suspicious. She also accused Mr Adams of sanctioning the Old Bailey court attack, in which one man died and more than 200 people were injured - 33 of whom were in Whitehall. Price - the former wife of Hollywood actor Stephen Rea - was part of the IRA unit that planted four car bombs outside the Old Bailey, as was her sister Marian. Two of the bombs exploded. The sisters and their gang were arrested as they tried to get back into Ireland. Price was . sentenced to life for the bombing but freed eight years later in 1981 because she was suffering from an eating disorder. History: Price had two sons with her ex-husband Hollywood actor Stephen Rea, pictured, who was one of the voices dubbed over that of Mr Adams during the 1980s broadcasting ban on him . Price, originally from Belfast, added that people who are informers ‘deserve to die’ and ‘that is . the Republican way’. Old Bailey bomber Dolours Price, pictured left at a civil rights demonstration near Belfast, joined the IRA with her sister Marian, pictured right, in the 1970s . She made the allegations . on the record to researchers working for Boston College in the U.S. The recordings were made on the basis . that they remain secret until the death of the 28 former IRA and Ulster . Volunteer Force terrorists who took part. But the Police Service of Northern Ireland has been battling to . recover the recordings as evidence as part of their investigation into the murder of Mrs McConville. A book based on recordings of two dead terrorists revealed that former IRA commander Brendan Hughes mentioned the ‘disappeared’ - people killed by the IRA and buried in secret graves. He made the allegation that high-profile murder victim Mrs McConville, who died in 1972, was killed by the ‘unknowns’ squad, claiming: ‘Gerry had control over this particular squad.’ Price said she gave interviews to Boston College to . ‘put Gerry Adams where he belonged’. Both Price and her 58-year-old sister, who has been imprisoned in Northern Ireland since 2011 after her licence was revoked, have been outspoken critics of the peace process. ‘I think the process should be . undermined,’ said Price. ‘I think the process should be destroyed in some . way and I think Gerry Adams deserves to admit to his part, in all of the . things that happened.’ Marion also named Mr Adams as the ‘officer commanding’ of the Belfast brigade of the IRA and claimed he asked for volunteers for the bombing campaign on mainland Britain. ‘Who sent me to London to blow it up? ... Gerry Adams. Yeah, fully sanctioned,’ she said. Price and Marian joined the IRA in the . 1970s. Her sister once claimed her miniskirt got her past British Army . officials in a car full of explosives. They had a Republican family . tradition. ‘My father used to sit us on his knee and tell us stories about how he'd . gone off to war in 1939 at the age of 19 to bomb the English,’ said Price. 'He said: ""If anyone doesn't want to go they should up and leave now . through the back door at 10 minute intervals"". The ones that were left . were the ones that went.' It is not yet known for sure how Price died, but . police in Dublin have confirmed they are investigating. Mr Adams, who strongly denies all the allegations, insisted he had no fears of what recorded interviews with Price might reveal as he expressed regret at her death yesterday. Asked about the prospect of the Boston College tapes now emerging into the public domain, he said: ‘I have no concerns over any of those issues because they are not true, but this is not the time to be rehearsing any of those. ‘We’ve just had news of this woman’s death and my thoughts are with her family, and her sister.’ Price married actor Mr Rea - who was one of the voices dubbed over that of Mr Adams during the 1980s broadcasting ban on him in Britain - in 1983. The couple, who have two sons together, divorced in 2003.

"Walks free: Reverend Richard Lee, 49, arrives at Bristol Crown Court where he was handed an eight-month suspended jail term for using secret cameras to spy on and film intimate pictures of three girls and a woman . A Church of England vicar walked free from court today after admitting using secret cameras to spy on and film intimate pictures of three girls and a woman. Reverend Richard Lee, 49, was handed an eight-month jail term, suspended for two years, at Bristol Crown Court after admitting eight counts of voyeurism and 18 counts of making indecent images. The offending took place over a ten-year period, in Weston-super-Mare where he was a priest in the diocese of Bath and Wells, and also in Gillingham, Kent. Judge Neil Ford, QC, said: 'I have agonised about my public duty in this case. While sentences of imprisonment must be imposed, they can be suspended.' Outlining the case, prosecutor Richard Posner said: 'For ten years, Richard Lee has been watching young girls. This was at a time when they believed, thought and trusted they had privacy. 'This was all for his sexual gratification. He breached the trust... and undermined the faith his community had in him.' The court heard Lee, who was suspended from his post when he was arrested in July last year, used secret cameras to spy on his victims, but was found out when the pictures were spotted on his laptop. Following police searches of the Locking vicarage in Somerset and churches, officers seized a number of computer equipment and found 400 category one images - the least serious - and 84 movies of the same category. High-tech examination of computers seized also revealed 51 category two images, three category three and four images and one category four movie. He also searched for images of child abuse on the internet, the court heard, although there was no evidence to suggest any of the material was shared with anyone else, while most of it was likely deleted, the judge said. He moved from Kent to work at two churches in Somerset. Disgraced: Rev Lee was the Church of England vicar for two Somerset village churches and also the co-ordinator of a local music group called WWJD. The offending took place over a ten-year period, in Weston-super-Mare where he was a priest in the diocese of Bath and Wells, and also in Gillingham, Kent . Lee previously officiated at All . Saints' Church in Hempstead before leading the congregations at St . Augustine's Church in Locking and St Mary's Church in Hutton. Lee, who has since moved to Bodmin in Cornwall to live with his parents, made a full confession to police upon his arrest. Mitigating, Robin Shellard said his client 'behaved with a degree of wickedness'. He said: 'Richard Lee appears in front of this court today a totally broken man. 'He . has, through his own folly but more importantly his own criminality, . lost everything he has worked for, for the whole of his life. Community figure: Lee previously officiated at All Saints' Church in Hempstead before leading the congregations at St Augustine's Church (above) in Locking and St Mary's Church in Hutton . 'He's lost everything that he held most . dear. He is overwhelmed with guilt and remorse. His parishioners have, . in many respects, quite rightly, rejected him.' In . a letter from one member of the public, the author described Lee as . 'the best vicar we've ever had, bringing the church to the people in a . way no other cleric had previously'. The judge added: 'You've lost your calling as a clergyman.' Lee was banned from working with children indefinitely and must complete a sexual offenders' programme. The . Diocese of Bath and Wells previously confirmed that in accordance with . the Clergy Discipline Measure, the Bishop of Bath and Wells Rt Revd . Peter Price suspended Lee from active ministry as soon as he was . arrested.","Rev Richard Lee, 49, admitted eight counts of voyeurism and 18 of making indecent images .

"A New York teenager who took a ‘test drive’ in a family friends’ Lamborghini has died after crashing the high-powered sports car into a guardrail. Samuel Shepard, 18, of Mount Sinai, Long Island was taking the car for a spin on a local county road early on Friday when he lost control. He was driving north in Mount Sinai at 2:25 a.m. in the 2010 Lamborghini which can cost anywhere between $200,000 and $300,000 second hand and slammed into a guardrail near Route 25A, police said. Death: Samuel Shepard, 18, pictured here, died after he crashed a family friend's Lamborghini on a county road in Mount Sinai on Long Island early Friday . Wreckage: This still image taken from video shows the scene of the early morning crash on Aug. 29, 2014 which left the high powered sport's car destroyed and a teenager dead . Shortly after the crash, the teenager was pronounced dead at Stony Brook University Hospital. The car's owner, Michael Power, 49, was a passenger in the car and was treated for non life-threatening injuries. Power, a friend of the Shepard family, had met the teenager at a parking lot near his home. They started talking about taking a test drive in the Lamborghini, Detective Sergeant Michael Fitzharris of the Sixth Precinct said. Detective Fitzharris told Newsday that excessive speed is believed to be a factor in the crash. He said: ‘I think it was probably just a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the kid, and this man chose to give him this opportunity.’ Cars: Sam Shepard sits at the wheel of a 1957 Chevy Bel Air, which his dad built, and he takes a selfie, right, his father Gene owns an auto body shop and said his son had always been around cars . Good kid: Sam Shepard, right, is pictured here with members of his family his dad Gene said that Lamborghinis were his son's favorite car . The crash occurred as the teenager returned to the parking lot. But no witnesses have come forward yet according to police. The teenager, who had graduated from Mount Sinai High School in June was looking forward to joining the elite Army Rangers and was supposed to start serving in October, his family said. His father, Gene Shepard owns Good Shepard Autobody in Port Jefferson Station. He said that Lamborghinis were his son's favorite car. The teenager's Facebook page also has dozens of photos of fast cars and bikes on it along with flyers for car rallies. Mr Shepard said: ‘He was a very talented kid with his . hands. He always helped me at the shop. ... He used to see his dad was . working hard and he'd pick up tools and start helping.’ ‘Since he's a kid, he's been around cars,’ he said. ‘He had his whole future planned out. He knew exactly what he was going to be doing, he told Newsday. However, his stunned father said that he had no idea about the test drive with Power, who had known Samuel since he was 4. Anyone who may have witnessed the crash is asked to contact the Sixth Squad at 631-854-8652 or call anonymously to Crime Stoppers at 1-800-220-TIPS.","Samuel Shepard, 18, of Mount Sinai, Long Island was taking the car for a spin on a local county road .

"It’s unlikely the majority of us are so overwhelmed with tweets, Facebook posts, emails and texts that we need someone - or something - to reply on our behalf. However, this hasn’t stopped Google filing a patent for a system that would do just that. According to the details of the latest patent filed by a software engineer at the firm, Google’s automated system would work like a social media bot and submit posts on a user’s behalf. Would you let a robot send emails on your behalf? Google's latest patent describes a system that generates automated replies to online conversations. It would do this by scanning social networks, emails and texts to learn how to write in a way that mimics your language and tone . In August a patent was approved that could see Google tracking, and making money from, the eye movements of its Google Glass owners. The Gaze Tracking System patent shows the device tracking where the wearer looks, how long they look at an item, and even how much their pupils dilate. Information about where the user is looking could then be sent to Google's servers where an image scanning algorithm would identify what they are looking at, create a log of everything they've viewed, and potentially use this information to serve adverts. It would do this by scanning that user’s previous posts and replies on sites such as Facebook, Google+ and LinkedIn, as well as their emails and texts messages, to learn how that person writes. The bot would then write replies and responses to future posts in a way that mimics that person’s usual language and tone. The more a person uses the system, the more the bot can learn the type of responses they write and this would make the suggestions sound more human and realistic. This would also potentially involve the bot scanning posts written by friends and family too, and could have significant privacy implications. Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother . Watch, told MailOnline: 'Technology like this must only ever be opt-in, . as it has the potential to allow companies like Google to harvest even . more data from your private communications to enable automatic posting . to sound authentic. 'If you regularly send a text message about a . certain type of medication or email a lawyer with words like ‘divorce’ appearing, the computer can quite easily identify you to a human . searching through the data looking for certain things. Google has already been criticised for scanning the content of emails in its Gmail service for advertising purposes so it could, in theory, do the same with posts, emails and text messages. Google has already been criticised for spying on the content of emails in its Gmail service for advertising purposes and could, in theory, do the same with this system. It would also potentially involve the bot scanning posts written by friends and family too, and could have privacy implications . Pickles continued: 'That sort of data is valuable to both governments and companies, so I’m . extremely concerned about any technology that purports to offer . convenience while in reality exposing more of our private communications . to prying eyes.' There are already bots capable of automating responses to emails, blog posts or comments but Google’s system would make the process more personalised. According to the patent: ‘There is no requirement for the user to set reminders or be proactive. ‘The system automatically, without user input, analyses information to which the user has access, and generates suggestions for personalised reactions to messages.’ However, the system wouldn’t be completely automated. A user would have to approve a suggestion made by the bot before it is posted in their name. Suggestions could also be rejected, which again would help the bot learn what kinds of posts are appropriate.","The patent was filed by a Google software engineer on behalf of the firm .

"A series of ritual killings of young women in the West African nation of Cameroon has caused panic in the capital city Yaounde. Families are now refusing to let their daughters go out after a spate of gruesome killings of young girls who were abducted by the drivers of motorcycle taxis before being murdered and dismembered. Police have found 18 mutilated bodies on the streets of the capital in the past two weeks, five of them outside a nursery school, and all are believed to be linked to occult rituals. Capital distress: Another five mutilated corpses were found on the streets of Yaounde, Cameroon, this weekend, taking the two-week death toll to 18 (file photo) In some parts of the country traditional healers believe that body parts including eyes, genitals, breasts and tongues have mystical powers, with many believing they bring riches and other good fortune.  Others believe that performing a human sacrifice will bring good luck. Ritual killings were common in Cameroon until the 1970s but as education spread, the number of murders decreased. Now families fear the practice is coming back, with the latest wave of killings causing near-hysteria in the capital city. This week, the sister of a 17-year-old girl whose corpse was found on Friday outside a nursery school, minus the genitals, tongue, eyes, hair and breasts, wrote to Cameroon President Paul Biya demanding action to prevent further killings. Deborah Ngoh Tonye Epouse Mvaebeme said her sister, Michele Mbala Mvogo, a student at the government bilingual High School Yaounde was abducted three days before her body was found outside a nursery school. She accused the city's commonly-used motorcycle taxi drivers of facilitating the murder, and said the government had failed to do enough to protect the victims, who were from the poverty-stricken neighbourhoods of Mimboman and Biteng. Terror town: The population of Yauonde is calling for the police and President Paul Biya to take action over the recent killings in the capital . One local said: 'The moto-taxi . drivers are the assassins' accomplices, and their targets are girls aged . 16-25 who get the taxis after nightfall.  For a large sum of money, . these girls are delivered to men in the suburbs who do the rest.' The head of a Mimboman nursery school told afrik.com how she found one of the bodies outside her school. She said: 'It was a strong smell of rotting that drew my attention, so I decided to do a tour of the school. 'That's how I found, behind one . classroom, a body of a young girl in an advanced state of decomposition, . with her underwear placed on her feet, before my very eyes.' Families in the neighbourhood are . said to be in a state of hysteria, banning their girls from taking . motorbike taxis and keeping them indoors after dark. Communication minister Tchiroma . Bakary said: 'Ritual sacrifices with a demoniac connotation are . unacceptable and intolerable, and the government will do all it can to . put a stop to it.' Ngoh Tonye, whose sister was murdered, told CNN: 'There is laxity in the forces in ensuring security in the capital.' The bodies of the five most recent victims were identified yesterday, according to a State security official who said most of the victims were high school students aged 15-26. Two men have been arrested in connection with the killings but so far no charges have been brought. The Cameroon capital, which has a . population of just over two million, is in a state of distress with . families staying behind locked doors as soon as darkness falls. Police . warn pedestrians to walk in groups at all times and have cracked down . on local bars frequented by criminals, shutting them down in the dozens. Vigilante . groups of young men guard the streets at night and hunt for the . killers, as the people of Yaounde say the police are not doing enough to . keep the city safe. The new wave of gruesome killings in the . capital has also seen dozens of complaints about mutilated corpses in . the mortuaries of Yaounde's public hospitals, according to Health . Minister Andre Mama Fouda.","Victims abducted by motorbike taxi drivers and dumped by nursery school .

"He’s battled the forces of evil in X-Men, explored the deepest regions of space in Star Trek, and has even been knighted for his achievements in acting. But there’s one thing Sir Patrick Stewart could not do – deal with the local cable company. The British actor spent a harrowing 36 hours waiting for cable empire Time Warner to come to his $2million home in Brooklyn, only to tweet that the experience made him lose ‘the will to live.’ Scroll down for video . Make it so: British actor Patrick Stewart, pictured in April, said that dealing with Time Warner Cable made him lose 'the will to live' The final frontier: Stewart is perhaps best known for his roles in Star Trek: The Next Generation, left, as Captain Jean-Luc Picard, and for portraying Professor Charles Xavier in the X-Men franchise, right . The 72-year-old thespian, having recently moved into a $2million home in Park Slope, was saddled with the mundane task of setting up his cable. But what should have been a few hours’ time turned into an Odyssey for the Shakespearean actor. He tweeted on September 13: ‘All I wanted to do was set up a new account with (Time Warner Cable) but 36hrs later I’ve lost the will to live,’ the actor tweeted. Some of Stewart’s followers tweeted their support. One fan asked: ‘Did you tell them to “make it so”?’ in reference to Stewart’s famous catchphrases as Captain Jean-Luc Picard in Star Trek: The Next Generation. Twitter war: Stewart tweeted his frustration at the cable company, and said it was too little, too late when they offered support . According to the New York Post, Stewart’s former Star Trek co-star LeVar Burton chimed in, tweeting a sympathetic: ‘Been there.’ Time Warner, which is notorious for long wait times and poor customer service, responded back on Twitter. ‘How can we assist you?’ they asked on their help handle. But it was too late for Stewart, who replied via Twitter: ‘If that question had been asked at any time in the last 36 hours it would have been of value. But now…’ Later that night, Time Warner tried to apologise for his frustration, saying: ‘If you change your mind we are here.  ^SS.’ The power of who? A representative for Time Warner said that any customer - no matter who they are - will receive the same treatment . A representative for Time Warner’s New York branch told the Post: ‘There’s no doubt we have a lot of fans at the company, of the actor, and Star Trek in general,’ the representative began. ‘But the truth is, any customer that reaches out to us… we’re going to offer them help the exact same way.’ There has been no further mention of the cable company on Stewart's Twitter feed.

"Forget leaving intimacy for the bedroom, one group of adventurous Germans has admitted that the bathroom is their preferred place for lovemaking. In a survey for German television channel Kabel-1's 'Adventure Life' show 17 per cent of those polled said that they love to have sex in the bathroom. Most of the respondents were more traditional, with 77 per cent choosing the bedroom as their favourite place for shenanigans, according to a report on thelocal.de. One in five Germans have admitted that their favourite place to have sex is the bathroom . A car crazy nine per cent liked to get their fix in an automobile while only one per cent admitted to mixing work and pleasure and having erotic adventures in the office. The survey also found that Germans have sex on average 6.4 times per month (that's more than once a week). Most (66 per cent) claimed that they weren't fussy about what day of the week it was, but 18 percent admitted that Saturday was a favourite day for sex. That doesn't mean the respondents were talking about their partners, an equal share of men and women admitted to having had at least one . affair, with 37 percent saying they had cheated on a partner in their lifetime.

Sexpert and MailOnline blogger Tracey Cox says: 'Bathrooms offer privacy and having a bath or shower together can be super sexy. But it also works well if your partner has hygiene problems. I often suggest people have a bath or shower with their partner before sex if they're worried about body odour. 'People who are squeamish about sex often like doing it in places like the shower because it feels 'clean'.

"Photographs of Kate Middleton changing her bikini bottom have been published in a Danish magazine, reigniting the privacy scandal surrounding the Royal couple. Celebrity magazine Se Og Hor (See And Hear) has gone further than any other publication and printed a 16-page special of photographs, including three of the Duchess of Cambridge changing her bikini bottoms – taken from the front. The photos appear to be from the same set of shots originally taken while Prince William and his wife were holidaying in the South of France. More pictures: A celebrity magazine has printed a 16-page special of photographs . There are thought to be up to 200 photos taken of Kate and William when they were sunbathing at a secluded chateau. The most revealing photograph in Se Og Hor, which appears on the front page of the magazine, shows the Duchess changing into a pair of blue bikini bottoms. Kim Henningsen, Se Og Hor’s editor in chief, was unabashed by the threat of legal action and declined to say who sold the photographs or how much was paid for them. He said: ‘It’s a set of unique photos from an A-class celebrity. It is my job to publish them.’ Copies of Swedish celebrity magazine Se & Hor (See and Hear), hit the shelves with the photos of the Duchess emblazoned across the front . More concerns: The photos appear to be from the same set of shots originally taken while Prince William and his wife were holidaying in the South of France . Kate and William won a landmark injunction in France to stop further publication of the images by Closer magazine, under the threat of a €100,000 (£80,000) fine. 'It’s a set of unique photos from an A-class celebrity. It is my job to publish them' Kim HenningsenSe Og Hor’s editor in chief . They have also handed over all files containing the images to representatives of the couple on the orders of the judge, after they were ruled a ‘brutal’ invasion of privacy. The court made no ruling for the magazine to name the photographer, however, and it has the right to protect his or identity under France’s laws on protection of journalistic sources. But the release of the unseen pictures of Kate confirms fears that the injunction will do little to halt the worldwide spread of the pictures. The revealing photographs of the Royal couple relaxing on a private balcony were first published in French magazine Closer, before a 26-page special was published in Italy’s Chi and Ireland’s Irish Daily Star.","Printed by celeb magazine Se Og Hor (See And Hear)

"Japan has been accused of ignoring its  policy of self-defence after launching its largest warship since the end of the Second World War as the government faces down China over a disputed chain of islands. The new ship is designed to carry up to 14 helicopters at once - but Japanese officials insist it is not an aircraft carrier and will not be used to launch military jets. The 250m vessel, named 'Izumo', is officially labelled a destroyer, although it has a flat top which functions as a flight deck like that on an aircraft carrier. The country is officially banned from . all military actions apart from self-defence and humanitarian aid under . the terms of the constitution imposed on it by the U.S. after the Second . World War. New ship: The destroyer Izumo is Japan's largest boat since the end of World War II . Flat-topped: But officials insist the ship is not an aircraft carrier and will not be used to launch planes . Its 'Peace Constitution' , which was designed by Allied leaders, followed Japan's involvement in the Second World War which included the devastating attack on US naval base Pearl Harbour in 1941. This eventually led to the U.S. dropping a nuclear bomb on Hiroshima in 1945, which brought about  Japan's surrender and the end of the war in 1945. Officials say the new ship will be used to defend Japan and deliver personnel and supplies to areas hit by natural disasters, such as the devastating 2011 earthquake. Japan's conservative prime minister Shinzo Abe is keen to change the constitution to allow the country to maintain a standing army for the first time in seven decades. The unveiling of the new destroyer - which has been under development since 2009 - also coincides with a dispute between Japan and China over a chain of tiny islands in the South China Sea. The two countries conduct regular . patrols of the waters around the islands, which are called the Senkakus . in Japan and the Diaoyus in China. Celebration: The ship was launched today with a large ceremony in the port of Yokohama . [caption . China reacted with alarm to the news of Izumo's launch and accused the Japanese government of aggressive intent towards other countries. 'We express our concern at Japan's constant expansion of its military equipment,' a spokesman for China's defence ministry told AFP. 'This trend is worthy of high vigilance by Japan's Asian neighbours and the international community. 'Japan should learn from history, adhere to its policy of self-defence and abide by its promise of taking the road of peaceful development.' Japan's constitution, known as the Peace Constitution, is most famous for the renunciation of the right to wage war. It . was drawn up under the Allied occupation which followed World War II . and was intended to replace Japan's previous militaristic and absolute . monarchy system with liberal democracy. Japan was responsible for . drawing the U.S. into World War II after it launched a surprise attack . on the U.S naval base Pearl Harbor in 1941. Grim: This shows the devastation caused by a U.S. nuclear bomb being dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 . The attack was intended as a preventive . action to keep the U.S. from interfering with its planned military actions in Southeast Asia, which included overseas territories of the UK, Netherlands, and . the United States. The conflict escalated massively when the U.S dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. On fire: This shows a U.S. warship burning after the surprise Japanese attack on U.S base Pearl Harbour in 1941 . This led to the surrender of the Empire of Japan on September 2, 1945 and brought the hostilities of World War II to a close. Japan's constitution  was enacted on  May 3, 1947. Tokyo's ties with Beijing chilled sharply last year after the Japanese government bought the rocky islands - known as the Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China -  in the East China Sea. The islands are controlled by Japan but also claimed by China. The United States says the islets fall under a U.S.-Japan security pact, but Washington is keen to avoid a clash in the economically vital region. Many people in Japan have called for . beefed-up naval and air forces to enable the country to enforce its . territorial claims against China, which recently began operating an . aircraft carrier purchased from Russia and is planning to build another. Popular: A conflict with China over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands has led to more aggressive sentiments . Streamers: The boat will supposedly be used for Japan's self-defence and humanitarian missions . Japan has one of the best equipped and trained navies in the Pacific, despite the constitutional restrictions on its deployment. The new destroyer could potentially be used launch fighter jets, or other aircraft which can take off vertically, although officials insist they have no plans to do so. The Izumo does not have a catapult for launching fighters, or a 'ski-jump' ramp for fixed-wing aircraft. It bears the same name as an armoured cruiser which was in operation between 1900 and 1945. Danger? China has warned Japan against building up its military capabilities in the South China Sea . The association with a vessel from the most aggressive period of Japan's imperial past could strengthen the impression that it is designed as a move towards militarisation. The original Izumo fought against Russia in the 1904-5 battle for dominance of north-east Asia, and was also involved in the Japanese invasion of China during the build-up to the Second World War.","Japan launches 250m destroyer Izumo which it says will be used for defence .

"The transfer window has finally shut after a summer of spending and a typically manic deadline day. Plenty of clubs will be happy with their dealings, while others will rue the ones who got away as £850million was splurged. Here, Sportsmail charts the winners and losers from the summer window... Spend, spend, spend: Premier League clubs splashed out more than £850m in the transfer window . Winners . Chelsea: Probably the biggest winners overall, buying well in the positions they needed to. Chelsea had a clear plan of the flow of players in and out of Stamford Bridge and struck early meaning Jose Mourinho could spend transfer deadline day relatively stress free. New additions Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas have made superb starts already. Hull City: Steve Bruce was the standout performer on transfer deadline day. He pulled off something of a coup, bringing in Hatem Ben Arfa from Newcastle and Gaston Ramirez from Southampton on the final day, to add some flair to a solid team. Add in club record signing, Uruguayan striker Abel Hernandez, and it speaks a lot about Hull’s ambition. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Top 10 Premier League transfers compilation . Superb start: Diego Costa has already scored four goals to Chelsea following his £32m move . Man City: Like Chelsea, City did much of their business early, eliminating the danger of panic buying. It was a relatively low key window but they managed to retain the signatures of key players while bolstering an already strong squad with shrewd purchases, like tough tackling Fernando and Eliaquim Mangala, who they identified as targets early on. Liverpool: Brendan Rodgers had a big money pot to play with from the £75m Luis Suarez transfer. He brought in nine players to bolster a squad that was sometimes short of depth last season. Mario Balotelli is a risky but potentially inspired signing. Dejan Lovren and Adam Lallana are likely to be key figures. Arsenal: There were nervous moments for fans who thought the window might pass without a striker being signed to replace the injured Olivier Giroud. The deal for Danny Welbeck went through at the death. While not a prolific goalscorer he has a great work rate and will be keen to impress at the Emirates and retain his England spot. Alexis Sanchez another good buy. Keen to impress: Danny Welbeck, mocked up here in an Arsenal shirt, is a good buy for the Gunners . Losers . Southampton: Ronald Koeman has done a sterling job of rebuilding after the heart was ripped out of this team, with several high profile departures. The club has reinvested some of the money in Serbian Dusan Tadic and Graziano Pelle who both look bright on early inspection. There is reason to be optimistic but this squad is ultimately weaker than last season. Man Utd: Spent plenty and two eyecatching signings but few spectators watched a dreary 0-0 against Burnley last week and thought what Louis van Gaal most needed was a top quality striker. While Radamel Falcao is a nice luxury it is a bit like laying a new floor when the roof is leaking. Weaknesses in central midfield and defence will need to be papered over. Surprise losers: Despite signing Radamel Falcao and Angel di Maria, Manchester United had a poor window . Tottenham: This window has been by no means a disaster for Spurs, who signed the versatile Benjamin Stambouli on deadline day, but it has been slightly underwhelming. They missed out on Danny Welbeck to north London rivals Arsenal and failed to land the superb Morgan Schneiderlin from Southampton. Mauricio Pochettino will have to work with what he already has. Newcastle United: Things started brightly on Tyneside with long-term targets Remy Cabella and Siem de Jong secured. But a lack of investment has left them short all over the pitch. The departure of talented Hatem Ben Arfa to Hull will come as a blow to fans who have been disappointed to see the playmaker marginalised by Alan Pardew. Burnley: A limited transfer budget has meant Burnley bought in bulk but with little emphasis on quality. Nathaniel Chalobah and Michael Keane, both bought on transfer deadline day, are both promising youngsters but unproven at the highest level, while George Boyd failed to make the grade at Hull last season. Failed to make the grade: George Boyd was Burnley's big signing but hasn't cut it in the Premier League .

"The Navy SEAL whose stunning account of Osama bin Laden’s death will be hitting bookstores next week says that his story is not intended to be political in any way. The former soldier, who wrote the book anonymously under the pseudonym Mark Owen, revealed himself for the first time in an interview that will air on September 9. 'No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed bin Laden,’ was originally slated to come out on September 11, but has since been moved up to seven days earlier. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Former Navy SEAL Matt Bissonnette appeared on US TV show 60 Minutes this week to discuss his book. CBS said they disguised his appearance for his safety . Speaking to 60 Minutes, the SEAL said that he was the second person in the room when bin Laden died, and was the one who took the pictures of his corpse. CBS said that they disguised the soldier's appearance and voice for the interview - for his safety. Account: No Easy Day was written anonymously under the pseudonym Mark Owen . He said that he wrote the book in honour of the men and women who helped with the intelligence gathering that led him and dozens of other Navy SEALs to the compound in Abottabad, Pakistan, where the terror boss was hiding out. The book, he said, is not about politics. 'My worry from the beginning is that it’s a political season. This book is not political whatsoever. It doesn’t badmouth either party and we specifically chose September 11 to keep it out of the politics.' He added: 'If these crazies on either side of the aisle want to make it political, shame on them. This is a book about September 11 and it needs to rest on September 11 - not to be brought into the political arena because it has nothing to do with politics.' Shortly after the book was announced, the SEAL was identified by FoxNews.com as Matt Bissonnette, 36, who retired from duty last summer - shortly have the raid that led to the al-Qaeda leader's demise. The firsthand account of the Navy SEAL raid contradicts previous accounts by administration officials, raising questions as to whether the terror mastermind presented a clear threat when SEALs first fired upon him. Bin Laden apparently was hit in the head when he looked out of his bedroom door into the top-floor hallway of his compound as SEALs rushed up a narrow stairwell in his direction, according to Bissonnette. Bissonnette says he was directly behind a 'point man' going up the stairs in the pitch black hallway. 'Less than five steps' from top of the stairs, he heard 'suppressed' gunfire: 'BOP. BOP.' The point man had seen a 'man peeking out of the door' on the right side of the hallway. Target: A member of Seal Team Six shot and killed Osama bin Laden during the elite squad's daring raid of his compound in Abbotabad, Pakistan . Commando: A photo purported to be of Matt Bissonnette was published by Business Insider on Thursday . The author writes that bin Laden ducked back into his bedroom and the SEALs followed, only to find the terrorist crumpled on the floor in a pool of blood with a hole visible on the right side of his head and two women wailing over his body. Bissonnette says the point man pulled the two women out of the way and shoved them into a corner and he and the other SEALs trained their guns’ laser sites on bin Laden’s still-twitching body, shooting him several times until he lay motionless. The SEALs later found two weapons stored by the doorway, untouched, the author said. Bin Laden as wearing a white t-shirt, loose-fitting tan pants and a tunic. In the account related by administration officials after the raid in Pakistan, the SEALs shot bin Laden only after he ducked back into the bedroom because they assumed he might be reaching for a weapon. Tension: The raid of bin Laden's Abottabad compound was watched by President Obama and his closest advisers in the Situation Room of the White House . Watching: In this undated image from video seized from bin Laden's compound, the Al-Qaeda chief watches a TV programme showing an image of President Obama . It took approximately 15 minutes to find -- and kill -- Osama bin Laden in his Abottabad compound. Involved in the mission in the early morning hours of May 2, 2011 were 79 commandos that arrived in off in military helicopters from Jalalabad, Afghanistan. The first helicopter foundered above Bin Laden’s compound and crash-landed in the outer courtyard. The other helicopter landed outside the house. The SEAL team forced their way into the compound by blowing the door with explosives. The commandos shot three men and a woman -- whom U.S. officials said had lunged at them -- as they went up floor-by floor. On the third level, three of the Navy SEALs saw bin Laden standing at the end of a hallway as they reached the top of the steps. Two women in the room took positions in front of the terror leader to protect him. One of the soldiers grabbed the women and shoved them away while one of the SEALs behind him fired at bin Laden. The al-Qaeda boss was shot once in the chest and once in the head. Code-word ‘Geronimo’ is sounded to White House Situation Room, a signal that their target is dead. The SEALs then photograph the body for identification. On their way out of the compound, the soldiers blow up the broken-down chopper. The teams fly back to Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. Bin Laden’s body was then flown to a waiting naval ship, that buried at sea. White House spokesman Tommy Vietor would not comment on the apparent contradiction late Tuesday. But he said in an email, 'As President Obama said on the night that justice was brought to Osama bin Laden, ""We give thanks for the men who carried out this operation, for they exemplify the professionalism, patriotism and unparalleled courage of those who serve our country.""' 'No Easy Day' was due out September 11, but Dutton announced the book would be available a week early, September 4, because of a surge of orders due to advance publicity that drove the book to the top of the Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble.com best-seller lists. The Associated Press purchased a copy of the book on Tuesday. The account is sure to again raise questions as to whether the raid was intended to capture or simply to kill bin Laden. Bissonette writes that during a pre-raid briefing, a lawyer from 'either' the White House or Defense Department told them that they were not on an assassination mission. According to Bissonnette, the lawyer said that if bin Laden was 'naked with his hands up,' they should not 'engage' him. If bin Laden did not pose a threat, they should 'detain him.' In another possibly uncomfortable revelation for U.S. officials who say bin Laden’s body was treated with dignity before being given a full Muslim burial at sea, the author reveals that in the cramped helicopter flight out of the compound, one of the SEALs called 'Walt' -- one of the pseudonyms the author used for his fellow SEALs -- was sitting on bin Laden’s chest as the body lay at the author’s feet in the middle of the cabin, for the short flight to a refueling stop inside Pakistan where a third helicopter was waiting. This is common practice, as troops sometimes must sit on their own war dead in packed helicopters. Space was cramped because one of the helicopters had crashed in the initial assault, leaving little space for the roughly two dozen commandos in the two aircraft that remained. When the commandos reached the third aircraft, bin Laden’s body was moved to it. Bissonnette writes disparagingly that none of the SEALs were fans of President Barack Obama and knew that his administration would take credit for ordering the May 2011 raid. One of the SEALs said after the mission that they had just gotten Obama re-elected by carrying out the raid. But he says they respected him as commander in chief and for giving the operation the go-ahead. Bissonnette writes less flatteringly of meeting Vice President Joe Biden along with Obama at the headquarters of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment after the raid. He says Biden told 'lame jokes' no one understood, reminding him of 'someone’s drunken uncle at Christmas dinner.' Terror house: Bin Laden's compound has since been torn down . Mission: Bin Laden was killed during the 40-minute operation by the elite Navy SEAL Team Six in his Abbottabad, Pakistan, compound, seen here . Beyond such embarrassing observations, U.S. officials fear the book may include classified information, as it did not undergo the formal review required by the Pentagon for works published by former or current Defense Department employees. Officials from the Pentagon and the CIA, which commanded the mission, are examining the manuscript for possible disclosure of classified information and could take legal action against the author. In a statement provided to The Associated Press, the author says he did 'not disclose confidential or sensitive information that would compromise national security in any way.' Bissonnette’s real name was first revealed by Fox News and confirmed to The Associated Press. Jihadists on al-Qaida websites have posted purported photos of the author, calling for his murder.

"An Arkansas woman has learned the hard way how easy it is to overdo it with eye shadow. Brandy Allen, 31, from Fayetteville, was arrested Monday for allegedly shoplifting $144 worth of makeup from a local beauty store. But her booking photo tells the tale of her alleged crime better than any arrest report. The makeup enthusiast was photographed for her mugshot with her eyelids smeared bright pink and blue. Living in the shadows: Brandy Allen, 31, from Arkansas, has been arrested for allegedly shoplifting $144 worth of eye shadow and other makeup from a beauty store. Police said they received a call Monday afternoon from the general manager of Ulta Beauty Store in Fayetteville about a suspected shoplifter. According to the arrest report obtained by 5News Online, Allen was spotted indiscriminately grabbing makeup by the handfuls without looking at prices or colors. Investigators stated that the makeup fanatic entered the store on North Mall Avenue with a companion who tried to create a diversion by asking employees questions and leading them away from Allen. When officers responded to the scene, the manager approached Allen and asked to examine the contents of her purse. After a few moments of rummaging through her bag, Allen took out several eye shadow containers. According to the report, as the woman pulled out the little boxes, she would smear the surface of the colorful powder in an attempt to make the beauty products appear used. Makeup heist: Allen was caught with boxes of lifted eye shadow and a red eyeliner in her purse that she had allegedly stolen from Ulta Beauty Store in Fayetteville . The 31-year-old then became belligerent and unleashed a torrent of profanities, claiming that no one had witnessed her steal anything. Police noted that customers with young children were within earshot of Allen’s foul-mouthed tirade. Ms Allen then allegedly pulled out a red eyeliner from her purse, which a store employee noted she had helped her pick out earlier, and broke it in half claiming that it was hers all along. Just after 3pm Monday, Allen was booked into Washington County Detention Center. She was released hours later after posting $840 bond.","Brandy Allen, 31, accused of stealing $144 worth of makeup from Arkansas business .

"Barcelona's 3-0 win over Elche came years in the making - six members of Luis Enrique's starting lineup were academy-produced while the entire bench also came from their famous footballing finishing school - La Masia.

Lionel Messi . Position: Forward . Age: 27 . The only thing that perhaps provided any surprise from Messi's two goals against Elche was that he was so sharp just six weeks after a draining World Cup. The four-time Ballon d'Or winner was back to his best to help Barcelona to an eventually easy win - dropping deep and creating chances for his team-mates as well as the two well-taken strikes. His second took him within six goals of the all-time Spanish record goalscorer Telmo Zarra and it is now just a matter of days before he can add another line to his bulging CV. Barcelona famously paid a young Messi's medical bills as he joined their academy and sporting director Carles Rexach was so desperate to sign him he drew up a contract on a napkin.

Best there is: The four-time Ballon d'Or winner will want to make up for missing out on the World Cup . Munir El Haddadi . Position: Forward . Age: 18 . Barcelona's new shining star - Munir left the Nou Camp pitch to a standing ovation after a solid debut capped by a stunning finish to secure the game just after the half-time break. He has been fast-tracked for a spot in the first team after impressing in pre season despite making just 11 appearances for Barcelona's B side last year. Barca snapped up the Madrid-born hotshot at the age of 11, nabbing him from the grasp of Atletico Madrid - and what a swoop that could turn out to be. Blessed with pace, skill and an excellent touch Munir's will be a name to remember. Dream debut: Munir El Haddadi scored the second goal just after the break to seal the win . Super finish: Munir guided the ball past the 'keeper with a brilliant touch from Ivan Rakitic's through ball . Rafinha . Position: Attacking midfielder . Age: 21 . Not quite as impressive as the other two - Rafinha completed a home-grown front three for Barca on Sunday night. He is the younger brother of Bayern Munich (and former Barcelona) midfielder Thiago and made his debut for the senior side at the age of 18 back in 2011. A strong loan spell at Celta Vigo in La Liga last season has seen him trusted in the first team at the Nou Camp but he will have to impress more if he is to keep his place once the likes of Neymar and Luis Suarez come back into the fold. Promising: Rafinha might not have made the difference against Elche but he completed an academy frontline . Andres Iniesta . Position: Centre midfielder . Age: 30 . Still one of the best midfielders around, Iniesta is now in his 13th season with Barcelona's senior side and his powers show no sign of waning. Those clever one-twos, darting runs and crisp passes were all on show against Elche as he helped Barca to dominate possession even despite having 10 men for the entirety of the second half. He was first spotted by the Catalan club at the age of just 12 - and after struggles to adapt to life away from his parents he rose through the ranks to graduate from La Masia, which he later spoke of the philosophy of, saying: 'Receive, pass, offer, receive, pass, offer.' He is one of the club's four homegrown captains and will remain a legend at the club long after he retires following a career that has already yielded a World Cup, two European Championships, six La Ligas and three European Cups - and he's still in his prime. Long-time hero: Andres Iniesta is in his prime and has long been regarded as one of Europe's best midfielders . Sergio Busquets . Position: Defensive midfielder . Age: 26 . While his diving and theatrics often steal the headlines, Busquets remains one of the best defensive midfielders around after forcing Yaya Toure out of the Barcelona side at the age of just 22. Born in Barcelona, he was promoted to Barca's B team by Pep Guardiola before eventually starring in the now-Bayern Munich boss's all-conquering tiki-taka side. He has now inherited the No 5 shirt from Carles Puyol and, entering the typical best years for a midfielder, the only way is up for the midfield hard-man. Class: Sergio Busquets provides another line of defence in midfield but also boasts some tidy passing . Jordi Alba . Position: Left back . Age: 25 . The one that got away - almost. Alba was released by Barcelona at the age of 16 after being deemed not good enough before his time with Valencia convinced his former employers to splash out £11m on the left back. Alba found himself playing football in Barcelona's other Nou Camp - the 1,500-capacity home of local side UE Cornella before joining Valencia's reserves in a deal costing less than £5,000. But his rise to become one of the best modern full backs saw Barca take him back as a full Spanish international and he is now back at home as a fixture for club and country. It's a celebration: Jordi Alba (right) embraces Messi after he scored Barcelona's third . Sergio Roberto . Position: Centre midfielder . Age: 22 . A substitute for the last 10 minutes against Elche, Sergio Roberto was picked over the legendary Xavi to take to the field by Enrique. Born just down the road in Reus he has been at the club since the age of 14 but has so far failed to nail down a place in the first team - although that's no mean feat when the likes of Xavi, Fabregas, Iniesta and Busquets have all been rivals. Substitute: Sergio Roberto came off the bench with Barcelona already 3-0 up over Elche . Pedro . Position: Winger . Age: 27 . Speedy wideman who offers something a little more direct than the typical tiki-taka style at the Nou Camp. Despite joining at the age of 17 Pedro fought his way through the B and C sides to become a first team regular and two-time European Cup winner. However, he has spoken of his fear at being forced out of the club this summer and the 27-year-old's days could be numbered. Pace: Pedro burns his marker Sergio Lopez with a run down the wing for Barcelona, appearing as a sub . Marc Bartra . Position: Centre back . Age: 23 . Critics tend to focus on Barcelona's lack of defensive options as the reason for Bartra's place in the squad but a new three-year deal signed last season shows the value he holds at the Nou Camp. He has appeared at four different youth international levels for Spain as well as making his full debut last year for the European champions against Equatorial Guinea. Javier Mascherano's sending off against Elche might give him a shot at first-team opportunities under Enrique - and maybe he can finally justify his agent's claim that he is '25,000 times better than Alex Song'. Quality: Barcelona haven't bought many defenders in recent years which has increased Marc Bartra's play time . Sandro Ramirez . Position: Forward . Age: 18 . Labelled as a 'classic No 9' despite standing at just 5 ft 9 ins, Ramirez is highly rated by Barca and was used extensively in pre-season and even managed to grab goals against HJK Helsinki and Leon. He has been likened to David Villa and has a lethal touch in front of goal, scoring at every level at which he has represented Barcelona and Spain. While it might be hard to break through at an elite European outfit, at the age of just 18 Ramirez can only learn from training regularly with the best in the form of Luis Suarez, Messi and Neymar. Only 18? Sandro Ramirez turned out for Barcelona in pre season vs Napoli but was on the bench against Elche . Jordi Masip . Position: Goalkeeper . Age: 25 . Third-choice goalkeeper at Barca, Masip was only on the bench due to the injury suffered by summer signing Marc-Andre ter Stegen. He was only promoted from the Barcelona B squad ahead of this season and was frequently a back-up even with the club's second string. Brothers in arms: Jordi Masip (centre) embraces Claudio Bravo (left) and Rafinha (right) at a photo op . Martin Montoya . Position: Right back . Age: 23 . There's no place like home for Montoya - he is just 23 but he has been with the La Liga runners-up for 15 years. He has been linked with moves away from the club in the past but remains a constant in the squad despite only being back-up to Dani Alves. Touch of class: But Martin Montoya was not required by Luis Enrique off the Barcelona bench . Xavi Hernandez . Position: Centre midfielder . Age: 34 . This year will almost certainly be the last that European football is graced with pass-master Xavi's presence. A move to the USA or Middle East beckons but even off the bench the 133-cap Spaniard can provide something for this Barcelona side. It's incredible to think he has now been with the club for 23 years.

"Anxious mothers are more likely to have babies who cry for longer, according to latest research. Women who experience stress, worry or panic attacks before becoming pregnant are more than twice as likely to report that their child cried ‘excessively’. It is not known why this link exists, but researchers said mothers suffering from anxiety may have a more ‘intrusive’ parenting style that could cause babies to cry more. Stress: Mothers with a history of anxiety have babies who cry for longer, research showed (posed by model) Experts also suggest a baby’s excessive crying may be due to the mother’s production of stress hormones during pregnancy, which may cross the placenta and affect the development of a child’s brain. They are calling for women suffering from anxiety in pregnancy to be supported during early motherhood. GP Dr Clare Bailey, a parenting specialist, said: ‘Mothers can easily get into a traumatic negative cycle when worrying about a newborn child. The more they worry, the less they sleep and calm themselves down and the more they worry. ‘Anxiety can make them hypervigilant, distressed by crying and even rejected by their child. ‘It intuitively sounds likely that a calm mother feeling relaxed, comfortable and confident will be more likely to help a child regulate its crying, while an anxious mother may be less likely to help a baby to self-settle. Babies can pick up emotional cues very early on.’ Some 300 mothers were interviewed while pregnant and asked about their history of anxiety (posed by model) The study, published in the journal Archives Of Disease In Childhood, looked at nearly 300 women who were in the early stages of pregnancy. They were asked about their history of anxiety and depression, and were interviewed during their pregnancy and until their child was 16 months old. Ten per cent of the women reported excessive crying following the birth. Further analysis found that babies born to women with an anxiety disorder were significantly more likely to cry for longer periods. Child health specialist Dr Harriet Hiscock, from the University of Melbourne, warned that the role of the father also needed to be examined and cautioned against adding to ‘a mother’s day of worry by blaming her for her infant’s crying’.","Study in journal Archives of Disease in Childhood examined 300 women .

"Luis Suarez was a goal machine during his time at Liverpool but he never quite managed to hit top form against Manchester City, the team he will face with Barcelona on Tuesday night. The Uruguayan could start alongside Lionel Messi and Neymar in a front three which City defender Pablo Zabaleta has claimed is 'perhaps the best strikeforce in the world'. But Suarez, who is no stranger to Manuel Pellegrini's men, has only found the back of the net once during six games against Sergio Aguero and Co. Luis Suarez, pictured in training at the Etihad on Monday, will face Manchester City with Barcelona . The former Liverpool forward has scored just one goal in six games against the Premier League champions . Suarez scores his first and only goal against City in a 2-2 draw at Anfield in August 2012 . The 28-year-old played six Premier League fixtures against City during his time with Liverpool, including the memorable 3-2 home win towards the end of last season. However, his only goal arrived in August 2012 when he curled home a free-kick in a pulsating 2-2 draw at Anfield - leaving him goalless at the Etihad, the venue for Tuesday's Champions League last-16 first leg. Suarez failed to score in his other five appearances against City despite playing the full 90 minutes in each, although he did register an assist in April last year when he set up a Raheem Sterling opener. Suarez celebrates after scoring a free-kick to give Liverpool a short-lived 2-1 lead against City . The Uruguayan is congratulated on his strike but this would prove to be his only goal for Liverpool against City . The ex-Ajax man's shooting has been wayward against the Manchester outfit, with just seven of his 22 attempts having hit the target. Suarez has also been booked in three of his six games and the reigning Premier League champions. Liverpool won two of the six games against City in which Suarez played and suffered defeat just once, a 2-1 reverse on Boxing Day in 2013.","Manchester City host Barcelona in the last 16 of the Champions League .

"Manchester United are attempting to return to the summit of the Premier League with the most expensive squad ever assembled in the English game. The arrival of Angel Di Maria this week takes the combined transfer fees of the United squad to an eye-watering £401.2million - and that figure could grow with new signings before the transfer window closes. The value of United's squad now outstrips their neighbours and defending champions Manchester City, who are worth a collective £344.15m when the transfer fees are added up. VIDEO Scroll down for Shaw and Herrera on target in United training . Expensive: Angel Di Maria's £60m move to Manchester United from Real Madrid has pushed the total transfer fees of United's squad beyond the £400m mark . Money men: The combined transfer fees of the United squad now exceed the £400m mark . Overtaken: United's summer buys have seen them leapfrog neighbours City as the Premier League's most expensively-assembled squad . Manchester United £401.2m . Manchester City £344.15m . Chelsea £341.8m . Liverpool £245.8m . Arsenal £209.5m . Chelsea come a close third on £341.8m following the acquisitions of Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa over the summer. City's title-winning squad from last season cost £364.7m to put together, while their successful team from the 2011-2012 season was worth £334.5m. United have so far spent £131.7m on four players - Di Maria, Ander Herrera, Luke Shaw and Marcos Rojo - as Louis van Gaal desperately tries to strengthen a squad that slumped to seventh in the table last season. But these big money signings are merely an escalation of United's exponential buying over the last decade with 17 members of the squad costing in excess of £10m when they arrived at the club. Reinforcement: United announced the £16m signing of Marcos Rojo from Sporting Lisbon last week . Incoming: Luke Shaw was signed from Southampton earlier in the summer . Chris Smalling, for instance, cost £10m when signed from Fulham in 2010, Phil Jones cost £16.5m when he arrived from Blackburn in 2011, and Wilfried Zaha cost £15m. The much-maligned Anderson was £27m, Antonio Valencia £16m and Ashley Young £17m. The result is by far the most expensively-assembled squad in the Premier League. And the numbers could increase further if United land £30m-rated Arturo Vidal from Juventus and other last-minute buys. United have made Vidal their prime target following the arrival of Di Maria and are involved in negotiations with the Italian champions. They are also interested in the Ajax defender Daley Blind, who is well known to Van Gaal, the former Holland coach. Next up: United's spending could increase further if they secure a deal for Juventus player Arturo Vidal (right) Dutch delight: Ajax and Holland defender Daley Blind (left) is also on United's radar . United's total transfer fees far outstrip those of title contenders Liverpool, who squad was put together for £245.8m, and Arsenal, worth a combined £209.5m. As transfer fees grow ever-more extortionate, the price of assembling a title-winning squad will grow higher and higher. Already, United have smashed the £400m mark.

"Cox, a sought-after wood-carving artist, said he spent 10 hours every day since the government shutdown began, cleaning up the National Mall -- until the Park Police made him stop . A kind-hearted South Carolina volunteer who has mowed lawns, cleared a fallen tree and emptied 'hundreds of trash cans' up and down the National Mall since the federal government partially shut down told MailOnline that an aggressive, 'bully' of a U.S. Park Police officer who 'looked like Robocop' today ordered him to leave the Lincoln Memorial. Chris Cox, the one-man landscaping crew, calls himself the Memorial Militia. He said he has been on a mission to spruce up the lawns, trees and trash bins near America's grandest memorials before the weekend, because a 'Million Vet March' event is expected to bring scores of retired servicemen and women to the nation's capital. U.S. Park Service employees have been furloughed by the thousands since Oct. 1, when a budget battle between the White House and congressional Republicans forced a partial shutdown of federal agencies. Even though the feds told him he's not welcome, Cox says his message hasn't changed. 'I'm calling on Americans,' the 45-year-old told MailOnline: 'Find a memorial. Go there. Instead of bringing a picnic basket, show up with a lawn mower and a rake.' Cox said he's not a veteran himself, but his grandfather served in the Marine Corps, his roommate was awarded multiple purple heart citations, and his stepfather is a 1959 West Point graduate. 'And his brother's name is listed on the Vietnam Wall,' Cox said. 'In my mind, that entitled me to pick up as much trash as I wanted to.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The take-charge landscaping volunteer didn't last long on the lawn of the Lincoln Memorial before Park Police officers told him to take a hike . Chris Cox has emptied 'hundreds' of trash cans on the National Mall since the federal government shutdown began, and cleared a fallen tree with his chainsaw on Wednesday. But when he tried to mow a lawn, the U.S. Park Police threw him out . Cox said a single Park Police officer overruled his kinder, gentler comrades on Wednesday, and told him to 'get your stuff and get out of here.' 'I had a great experience there for the most part,' he recalled, saying the police 'knew who I was by the second day – they had my social security number somehow! And they all welcomed me. Nobody said anything to me for the next 6 or 7 days. I thought they were on my side because they saw what I did for them.' 'Then this one cop, a big ... guy, he had me scared, and I'm six-foot-two and 225 pounds. I don't get intimidated easily. I mean, I had a chainsaw. But he was being a bully.' He said he told the officer that it broke his heart to see newspaper photos showing the Mall in disrepair after the shutdown began. 'I'm not here trying to make headlines,' he recalled saying. 'I'm here trying to prevent headlines.' 'He says to me, ""Well, maybe there should be a picture of the trash cans overflowing in the newspaper. Maybe that would help us.""' 'I disagree,' Cox told MailOnline. 'Do you want all the veterans coming here and tripping over banana peels, and dirty diapers, and everything?' 'These are our memorials,' Cox told WNEW-99.1 CBS radio in Washington, D.C. earlier in the day. 'Do they think that we’re just going to let them go to hell?' 'No, . if they shut down our memorials, we're still going to take the trash . out, we're going to clean the windows, we're going to cut the grass, . we're going to pull the weeds, we're going to do the tree work.' Cox (L) is known for his wood carvings, which he sells out of a roadside garden center in suburban Virginia . Cox, 45, said while most of the Park Police officers he has encountered in the last week appreciated his efforts, one told him Wednesday that he had no right to empty trash cans near the Vietnam, Lincoln and World War II memorials . 'The day of the shutdown – I'm watching the news a week ago, and they're talking about how vulnerable the memorials are,' he told MailOnline. 'So right after the news I threw my bicycle into my truck and I patrolled the memorials all night long. They were right. Anyone could just come up there and spray paint or whatever.' 'I realized that I could serve my country better as a custodian,' he concluded. Cox also brought a giant South Carolina flag, which he carried over his shoulder while he worked. 'The trash cans were overflowing. I emptied hundreds of trash cans on the Mall. I grabbed a leaf blower and blew the leaves off the lawn near the memorials. Today I showed up and a giant tree had fallen over. I took my chainsaw and cut it up and hauled it away.' Later, he said, 'They let me mow the lawn for an hour or so.' And then the police showed up. Two officers, Cox said, 'were high-fiving me. They knew I had spent 10 hours a day out there emptying trash, and I think they admired that.; . But the third, he recalled, rebuffed his handshake, saying 'I don't shake hands. ... You need to get that lawnmower out of here.' That officer later told him that he was 'not allowed to pick up trash. That's not your job,' said Cox. Cox said his tree surgery and lawn mowing was just the icing on the cake: He's been emptying 'hundreds of trash cans' all week and beautifying the National Mall for an upcoming veterans' march . 'Find a memorial,' Cox advises Americans disillusioned by the government shutdown. 'Go there. Instead of bringing a picnic basket, show up with a lawn mower and a rake.' Park Police public information officer Sergeant Paul Brooks said Cox wasn't arrested. 'He was asked to leave, and he complied,' Brooks said. But 'I couldn't believe it was happening,' Cox told MailOnline. 'They changed the reason later, saying it was because I had a gas can and the other guy lit himself on fire.' Last week a man saluted the U.S. Capitol before sitting down on the National Mall, pouring gasoline over his own head and killing himself with a lighter. 'And I was like, ""Do you think I'm going to mow the lawn first, and then kill myself?"" 'Give him a medal,' quipped one reader on Reddit, after the story first broke on Twitter and Instagram. 'The medal-givers are all on furlough,' replied a second. 'I'm surprised he wasn't taken down by a seal team,' another chimed in. The government's partial shutdown has put hundreds of thousands of federal employees on unpaid vacations, including tens of thousands attached to the Department of the Interior, which runs the National Mall . Memorials on the Mall have officially been closed for eight days, along with all 401 National Parks and countless other public sites.","South Carolinian leapt into action as the federal government's shutdown began, cleaning up trash and tending the grounds on the National Mall .

"The United States is preparing to send 200 combat troops to join 1,100 fighters in a large joint military . exercise this month in western Ukraine, as as fighting between the army and Russian-backed rebels rages in the eastern part of that country. The decision to go ahead with the Sept. 16-26 'Rapid Trident' exercise is seen as a sign of the commitment of NATO states to support Ukraine – which is not a NATO member – while stopping short of . military intervention in the conflict. The annual exercise, to take place in the Yavoriv training . center near Ukraine's border with Poland, was initially . scheduled for July, but was pushed back because early planning was . disrupted when Russian-backed separatists began a significant military invasion from the east. 'At the moment, we are still planning for (the exercise) to . go ahead,' U.S. Navy Captain Gregory Hicks, spokesman for the United States European Command (EUCOM), told Reuters on Tuesday. President Barack Obama reviewed an Estonian honor guard on September 3, ahead of military exercises that will match up American troops with those from 13 other countries . Canadians like these fighter pilots will join the US in war games seemingly designed to send a 'back off' message to Vladimir Putin . NATO stepped up military activity in its eastern member . states after Russia's annexation of Crimea in March, and is . expected to agree at a summit in Wales this week to create a new . rapid reaction force of several thousand troops. In addition to staging air force exercises, the U.S. is moving tanks and 600 troops to Poland and the Baltic . states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania for additional joint maneuvers in . October, replacing a more lightly armed force of paratroopers. But Rapid Trident will entail the first significant . deployment of U.S. and other personnel to Ukraine since the . crisis erupted. President Barack Obama was in Estonia on Wednesday to . reassure the former Soviet Baltic states of that American support hasn't wavered; Estonia's prime minister called on Tuesday for a more visible . NATO presence in eastern Europe. Washington has promised Ukraine $52 million in 'nonlethal' security aid, and has already provided combat rations, body . armor, radios and other equipment. Pentagon leaders have met . with their Ukrainian counterparts to discuss a range of options for cooperation. But for now, supplying lethal military hardware is off the table. 'It is very important to understand that a military solution . to this problem is not going to be forthcoming,' President Barack Obama told . reporters at the White House last week. EUCOM says the exercise . this month will involve about 200 U.S. personnel along with 1,100 others from Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Britain, Canada, Georgia, . Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Norway, Poland, Romania and . Spain. Focused on peacekeeping, it will include command post . drills, patrolling and dealing with improvised explosive . devices. While it involves many NATO members as well as countries . such as Ukraine, who are part of NATO's broader 'Partnership for . Peace,' the exercise is not formally a NATO drill. The border region between Poland (in green) and Ukraine (in orange) will host the 'Rapid Trident' exercises as conflict brews near Ukraine's eastern border with Russia . America's Eastern European Command confirmed that 200 U.S. servicemen and women will participate in the exercises . More broadly, under a broad program titled 'Operation . Atlantic Resolve' meant to show U.S. commitment to the European . allies, NATO is running what officials say is a ramped up . version of its regular summer and autumn training schedule. Obama has announced a series of ever-increasing U.S-backed economic sanctions designed to financially cripple Russian President Vladimir Putin and his circle of close allies from the country's aristocratic and business class. A tougher blow came Wednesday, as France decided to postpone delivery of the first of two warships Russia had ordered as part of a $1.6 billion deal. French President Francois Hollande's office said in a statement that 'despite the prospect of a ceasefire which still remains to be confirmed and implemented, the conditions for France to deliver the first warship are not, to date, in place.' Putin has amped up his rhetoric in recent days, telling outgoing European Commission President José Manuel Barroso on Tuesday that Kiev, Ukraine's capital, would be an easy conquest for him if he wanted it.

The 21-year-old has been rewarded for an impressive start to the season which has seen him strike four times for the Scottish champions. The news was confirmed by Scotland Under-21 coach Billy Stark, who has seen him promoted from his squad. Nod: Celtic midfielder Callum McGregor has won a Scotland call-up  for next month's clash with  Germany . Stark said: 'Andy Robertson has stepped up from the Under-21s and now Callum McGregor. Whilst it has not been the most successful of campaigns, the other part of it is players going through.' Celtic goalkeeper Craig Gordon is also included in the squad following his comeback from a career-threatening knee injury. Morrison has made the squad while Wolves midfielder Kevin McDonald is the only other uncapped player alongside McGregor. Chris Burke, Shaun Maloney and Craig Bryson are among the other midfielders in Gordon Strachan's squad. The Scotland manager has named three strikers - Steven Fletcher, Steven Naismith and Derby's Chris Martin - meaning there is no place for the likes of Jordan Rhodes, Ross McCormack or Leigh Griffiths.

"It promises to replace all your credit cards with a single slim, digital card. San Francisco firm Coin first took the internet by storm last year when it revealed the $100 card. Now, it is set to let the first customers test the gadget that could take over your pocket. Scroll down for video . The way of the future: The Coin card aims to make paying with multiple credit cards simpler by incorporating everything you own onto one device . Past/Future: Coin wants to replace bulging wallets full of credit cards with a single device called a Coin (right) that can hold the information of all the cards you own . The Coin uses a magnetic strip like any regular credit or debit card. However the information on the strip can change depending on what card the customer wants to use. Debit cards, credit cards, gift cards, loyalty cards and membership cards can all be loaded. An app is used to program the information of up to eight cards securely in the device. The buyer is then able to switch between cards at the press of a button. 'Coin works with your debit cards, credit cards, gift cards, loyalty cards and membership cards,' the firm boasts. 'Instead of carrying several cards you carry one Coin.' The Coin card is that is uses a magnetic strip like any regular credit or debit card. However the information on the strip can change depending on what card the customer wants to use. An app is used to program the information of up to eight cards securely in the device. The buyer is then able to switch between cards at the press of a button. To make the card foolproof, the company said this week it will expand its beta program to 10,000 people. Compact: The Coin car is sleek and small by a regular credit card but it can hold the information of up to eight others including debit cards, gift cards, loyalty cards and membership cards . 'This is designed for the lifestyle of today with the technology of tomorrow,” says Kanishk Parashar, founder of Coin. 'You don’t need eight cards every day, so your phone is kind of like your drawer, and your Coin is kind of like your wallet.' Users then take photos of their cards, swipe them through the dongle and upload them to the Coin mobile app, which stores the info onto your Coin card. When you want to pay, you browse through stored cards on your Coin, select one, and swipe it anywhere credit, debit or gift cards are accepted. Information is loaded onto the card through a mobile app, which the firm launched last month. The process of adding card information to the mobile app is very simple and is done by taking a picture or two and swiping credit cards through a dongle attached to your phone. However critics have claimed the device is nothing to get too excited about. As countries slowly move towards the more secure Chip & PIN credit card system, the Coin device is likely to become obsolete. Mobile payments remain an elusive area with a number of banks and card suppliers attempting to come up with a convenient, safe and secure solution. Convenient: The coin card is approximately the size of a single credit card that can store all your swipe-able cards and be used to pay everywhere cards are accepted, all in real time . In order to make a payment with this card, users tap a button on the Coin card and pick which account they want to pay with, whether it's a business credit card or a personal debit card. After picking an account, the Coin card is swiped through, no different than any other card. Both tech large and small have attempted to crack the mobile payments sector and any firm able to facilitate person-to-person or person-to-business transitions on a mass scale stands to gain significant profit off such payments. Will Oreumus, a blogger with FutureTense, isn't convinced the technology will takeoff. 'To . me, the only real problem with Coin is that it feels like a stopgap . technology, like those CD-changer cartridges that were popular for a . little while before everyone switched to mp3s. Replacing . eight cards with one may lighten your load by an ounce or two, but is . that enough to convince people to take the leap of faith involved in . adopting a new payment system? Even . early adopters could be forgiven for holding out for a more . comprehensive digital wallet—the kind that will let you pay for . everything just by tapping your phone, or perhaps some other, even more . seamless gesture.' Other . critics have said the card is not forward-thinking or future-proof . whatsoever. One claimed it was nothing more than 'old technology wrapped . up in a posh case.' 'This . is not at all useful overseas where Canada, Mexico and most of Europe . use Chip & PIN. In fact, it's typical American thinking whereby the . developers have only thought of themselves and not of the winder . consequences of usefulness of the product.Save your $100 if I were you!' How it works: Your credit cards and loaded onto the Coin app by swiping them in and taking a photo. The Coin card can then be used like a normal credit card . Smart card: The Coin card uses a Bluetooth emitter which means if the card is left behind for any reason the card will no longer function . The . battery in Coin, said to last up to two years, powers a small display . screen that shows which saved card will be charged, along with its . expiration date. Cards are entered into Coin after being swiped on a Square-like dongle plugged into a smartphone. There are also few worries about leaving the card behind somewhere or losing it altogether. The coin card only operates if your smartphone is nearby by using the Bluetooth signals. If the card is disconnected for more than ten minutes, the phone will alert the customer that they have left their card behind. If the owner drifts too far from Coin, his or her smartphone will alert them. If the card is disconnected for more than 10 minutes, it automatically disables itself, which could potentially be an issue if a phone runs out of juice.","Coin allows you to load up to eight cards onto a single plastic device .

"David Moyes chalked up his first big win in Spain on Sunday night by beating the mighty Barcelona. He is not yet two months in to his La Liga adventure but the signs are that he can be a success in San Sebastian. Sportsmail looks at the story so far... Beating Barca as a springboard . Still beaming after Sunday night’s win, Moyes admitted post-match: ‘When we scored after two minutes I turned to my assistant Billy McKinlay and said: ""We could do with the final whistle coming now"". It was backs-against-the-walls stuff for most of the game but the resilience, intensity and defensive organisation that he has tried to instil in his new charges was there for all to see. David Moyes shakes hands with Lionel Messi after his Real Sociedad side beat Barcelona . Sergio Canales (right) and Xabier Prieto celebrate Sociedad's winner - a Jordi Alba own goal . The temptation from the club president Jokin Aperribay will now be not to spend in the January transfer market with the club very keen to make the most of its excellent youth system. But Moyes stressed on Sunday night: 'We need to add quality if we want to be at the top end of the table. I love the philosophy of the club and want to work within that but you also need experience.' The changes he has made . The first thing he noticed upon turning up in the Basque country last November was that the players were not fit. After a shambolic pre-season, not helped by having to play Europa League qualifiers, the players were not ready for the rigours of a tough season. ‘It’s not something you can change in the middle of a campaign,’ he said. ‘People will notice the difference in the coming months and definitely next season.’ He will have been delighted with how well they held out on Sunday night after fading badly in the second half of many games since he took over. He will also have been delighted with the defensive organisation. He can be seen, on the usually cold and wet training pitches of Zubieta, pulling his defenders into position as part of the defensive drills he has leaned heavily upon since his arrival to bring some order to the team. Apart from a nightmare second half against Villarreal when they conceded four, the side have been very hard to score against under Moyes. Moyes has put in plenty of work in on the training pitch and Sociedad are beginning to reap the benefits . Settling in . He is still staying in the city’s Maria Cristina hotel which overlooks the Uruma river as it meets the Atlantic (hence no rush to find permanent accommodation) but he is keen to pick out a family home as he puts down roots in one of the most picturesque regions of Spain. It rains a lot and it stays colder than most other parts of the peninsula so there is no beating sun to hide from. Moyes wants to make the often inclement conditions at the club’s Anoeta Stadium part of Real Sociedad’s armoury – other teams don’t want to visit northern Spain; Barcelona didn’t much fancy the 9pm kick-off on Sunday and Moyes sees that as a potential advantage. Talking a good game . He is taking lessons but the enormity of learning another language aged 51 when you are also a full-time football manager has already hit home. Pep Guardiola had a German teacher shadow him for the six months that led up to him taking the reins at Bayern Munich, Carlo Ancelotti locked himself away for several weeks before beginning his English adventure at Chelsea and others like Jose Mourinho have been fluent in other languages since school age. Scotsman Moyes wears a Sociedad scarf during his unveiling at the Anoeta back on November 13 . Moyes shares a joke with the media during a press conference to preview the Barcelona match . Nov 22: Deportivo (A), La Liga, D 0-0 . Nov 28: Elche (H), La Liga, W 3-0 . Dec 4: Real Oviedo (A), Copa del Rey, D 0-0 . Dec 7: Villarreal (A), La Liga, L 0-4 . Dec 14: Athletic Bilbao (H), La Liga, D 1-1 . Dec 17: Real Oviedo (H), Copa del Rey, W 2-0 . Dec 20: Levante (A), La Liga, D 1-1 . Jan 4: Barcelona (H), La Liga, W 1-0 . Overall: P8 W3 D4 L1 F8 A6 . Moyes is determined but it will not be easy. His ‘dos, tres, cuatro times’ press conference effort became an internet hit and he also shouted out ‘Stefano!’ when there is no such player at Real Sociedad during his first match. But the main thing is that he is making the effort and the effort is being appreciated. Many of Real Sociedad’s players speak English. Former QPR midfielder Esteban Granero has already told Sportsmail that Moyes’ English is easier to understand that Harry Redknapp’s so there seems to be no great communication problem. A translator is at Moyes’ side during training sessions and press officer Luis Arconada (son of the great Spain and Real Sociedad goalkeeper) is also fluent and constantly on hand to help the new manager. What the future holds . He has already stressed the priority is to pull away from the bottom and not be in a relegation dog-fight at the end of the season. But he is always well aware that only last season La Real were playing in the Champions League so he needs to push them back towards the top four as soon as possible. To do that he will need to be allowed to bring in quality this January. The club are very keen to use its excellent B-team youth side Sanse. Moyes buys into the philosophy because he knows it well from his Everton days but he is also keen to be allowed to go out and get a Tim Cahill or Mikel Arteta just to add that extra touch of quality and experience. Moyes is hoping that the San Sebastian club will back him in the transfer market during the January window .","Former Manchester United and Everton manager took over in November .

"Steven Gerrard’s move to LA Galaxy will be finalised in the next 24 hours. The 34-year-old Liverpool captain has agreed an 18-month contract, worth £3.9million a year, to move to California and will start playing in the MLS when their mid-season transfer window opens in July. The Reds skipper was out in Liverpool city centre at Secret nightclub on Tuesday night to celebrate Martin Skrtel's 30th birthday. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Steven Gerrard break his silence on his Liverpool exit .

Jose Enrique (left) and his partner Amy Jaine pose outside the city centre venue while Lazar Markovic (right) appeared in good spirits . Steven Gerrard won't be the first Premier League star to join LA Galaxy. David Beckham, Landon Donovan, Juan Pablo Angel and Abel Xavier featured both in England and America for LA Galaxy. Gerrard and his team-mates were joined by manager Brendan Rodgers for the night out as the Liverpool squad appeared in high spirits following Monday night's 2-1 victory over Wimbledon in the FA Cup third round. Summer signings Lazar Markovic, Alberto Moreno and Rickie Lambert were also in attendance along with defenders Glen Johnson, Luis Enrique, Javier Manquillo. Gerrard revealed he had turned down offers from clubs in the Barclays Premier League, Europe and the Middle East. Most significantly, though, he revealed he would have committed his future to Liverpool had they offered to extend his terms when he retired from England. When he ended his England career after the World Cup, it was with the intention of committing to Liverpool for the next ‘two or three years’ but an offer did not arrive until last November. ‘If a contract had been put in front of me in pre-season I would have signed it,’ Gerrard told the Liverpool Echo. ‘I’d just retired from England to concentrate on Liverpool. ‘I didn’t want my club games to be tailored. My injury record had been fantastic for the past two-and-a-half years and I had a great season from a personal point of view last season.

That period between the summer and the end of November gave me thinking time. There’s no blame and I’m not angry about it. ‘There are other people in the squad and the club had other things to worry about. Liverpool FC have been unbelievable for me since I was eight. This club has helped me fulfil my dreams.’ Manager Rodgers had wanted to keep Gerrard at Anfield and the iconic midfielder insisted again that the decision to part was amicable; he made his decision after Rodgers revealed he would be tailoring his game time next season. Such is Gerrard’s quality, though, his availability alerted a number of clubs, with Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini, for one, expressing his admiration. But Gerrard said: ‘I had a lot of offers — domestically, from Europe, Asia and America. ‘When I decided the time was right to leave Liverpool, I knew straight away I wouldn’t ever sign for another domestic club or anyone in Europe. ‘I never wanted to find myself in the situation where I was coming back to play against Liverpool. Even if I went somewhere else in Europe I’d be running that risk in terms of the European competitions. ‘Also, I said to myself that if you want to play for a big team in Europe with a great coach then I may as well stay put as I had all that here already. ‘That wouldn’t have been the change I was looking for. The attraction of America was a different lifestyle, a different culture for myself and my family.’ AFC Wimbledon striker Adebayo Akinfenwa believes Liverpool will struggle without Gerrard . Gerrard was Liverpool’s star in their FA Cup win over AFC Wimbledon on Monday. The man who tormented Gerrard’s defensive team-mates that night, Adebayo Akinfenwa, believes they will miss their captain. ‘To lose him, boy, I don’t know the future, but it will be a problem,’ said Akinfenwa, who rattled his beloved Reds with an equaliser before Gerrard’s winner. ‘You can see he was the difference. If he didn’t play, it would have been a different story. He was miles better than anybody on the pitch. ‘Sometimes when you play against people you can just use the word “class”. That’s what it is. Two moments of magic won the game. ‘He is the difference and Liverpool will lose that. I don’t want to see him go. Not just as a Liverpool supporter but as a lover of football. He will be a massive miss.’ Akinfenwa swapped shirts with Gerrard after the final whistle. ‘I just spoke to him quickly,’ he said. ‘I was like: “I’m a fan, please don’t go, man."" He just smiled. If he needs to go to pastures new, so be it. All you can do is wish him on his merry way and hope he comes back as manager one day.’ The mantle of being Liverpool’s next iconic player is up for grabs and the man most likely to fill it is Raheem Sterling. He missed Monday’s win after being given time away from the club by Rodgers. Sterling returned to Jamaica after the 2-2 draw with Leicester but is expected to be back in contention for Saturday’s trip to Sunderland. Raheem Sterling is currently in Jamaica but is expected to face Sunderland at the weekend .","Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard will sign an 18-month contract .

"A stripper who ended up neglecting her children has been sentenced to 20 years behind bars. The mother of two was found guilty of starving her two young children whilst she went out to work as an escort. It took jurors just two hours to find 24-year-old Kayela McClintick guilty on two counts of injury to a child. Guilty: Kayela McClintick, 24, has been sentenced to 20 years behind bars for neglecting her two children . Prosecutors told the jury that she forced the girls to stay in the closet when she stripped and performed lap dances for men at their home . The girls were left at this home in an upstairs bedroom. Medical experts testified at the trial that the younger girl had protruding ribs, a distended stomach and clumps of hair missing . During the trial McClintick took the stand, telling jurors that she still did not feel guilty. 'I take responsibility,' said McClintick. 'They are my kids, but I do not feel guilty about it.' Mcclintick also stated that if she would have known that her two children were that bad off, she 'would have acted on it.' Authorities only found out about the abuse when police were called to her home. During her punishment hearing, McClintick, 24, took the stand in her own defense. McClintick said she fed her children three times a day with a snack in between . Her daughters are now in foster care. The oldest was diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder . McClintick will be eligible for parole in 10 years . When they got there they found McClintick's six-year-old daughter in a closet and her two-year-old girl in an upstairs bedroom. Both children were starving and dehydrated - so much so the toddler had to be taken to hospital. Prosecutors told the jury that she forced the girls to stay in the closet when she stripped and performed lap dances for men at their home. Medical experts testified at the trial that the younger girl had protruding ribs, a distended stomach and clumps of hair missing. Both children were not being adequately fed. 'This was the ultimate betrayal,' said prosecutor Catherine Wilson during closing arguments. 'Send a message to our community. We will not allow our children to be starved.' During her punishment hearing, McClintick, took the stand in her own defense. 'It's eating me from the inside out,' said McClintick who asked jurors for probation. 'If I would have known I would have acted on it.' McClintick said she fed her children three times a day with a snack in between. She will be eligible for parole in ten years. Prosecutors said the children suffered so much that there were no circumstances that warrant probation. Her defense attorney tried to convince jurors to find some leniency in their approach by telling the McClintick was already facing enough punishment because her kids were taken away from her. 'For the fact that mom was stripping, that mom was an escort, that she was drinking alcohol and partying while her children were starving,' said prosecutor Catherine Wilson. 'We're not asking to walk away scot-free,' said defense attorney Kenneth Bell. 'We're not asking to be released today. What she is asking is, in lieu of 99 years to life, to have the ability to be rehabilitated.' McClintick could have faced life in prison, but jurors sentenced her to 20 years.","Kayela McClintick, 24, would often bring men back to her home where she would strip for them .

"Barcelona will not be allowed to sign players in 2015 after the Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld the FIFA sanction imposed on the Catalan club. The ban was imposed on Barca after they were deemed to have breached rules on signing international players under the age of 18. Barca were appealing the ban at CAS headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, this week but it was confirmed on Tuesday morning that it has been upheld and the Catalans will also be fined 450,000 Swiss Francs (£293,000). Luis Suarez's move to Barcelona was allowed while the club appealed against a ban on new signings, which is now in force after FIFA's original sanction was upheld by the Court of Arbitration for Sport on Tuesday . Thomas Vermaelen is one of five players to have moved to the Nou Camp this summer . Although they cannot make new signings they can renew contracts and recall on-loan players. Barcelona were not happy with the decision and released a statement blasting CAS. 'FC Barcelona wishes to state, with all due respect for the sports authorities, that it totally disagrees with the verdict of the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) announced today to confirm the sanction originally imposed by FIFA as a consequence of the alleged breach of regulations on the international transfer of minor footballers. 'The club has made it clear to the FIFA Disciplinary Commission, the FIFA Appeals Commission and the CAS itself that it understands and supports the policy on the protection of minors and the concern for the protection of their development and education. 'This is confirmed by how they club has acted throughout its history, setting an example around the world for the way its young footballers are schooled and educated, and the work that is done on their development. FC Barcelona's youth structure has enabled hundreds of young players to achieve their dreams and receive a decent upbringing. Ivan Rakitic has also moved to Barcelona after their ban was delayed, but it is now in full force . 'The errors that the club might have committed, and which have been recognised and argued before the corresponding authorities are, in all cases, of an administrative nature and to a large extent have been caused by the existing conflict between the FIFA regulations and Spanish legislation, along with the Club's conviction that it was acting correctly. 'Therefore, FC Barcelona considers the sanction to be completely disproportionate as it supposes an excessive punishment for the club, when considering its trajectory and the circumstances of this specific case.' CAS had earlier released a statement saying: 'CAS has dismissed the appeal filed by FC Barcelona against FIFA regarding the decision issued by the FIFA Appeals Committee on August 19, 2014. Suarez is introduced to Barca fans in August after making his summer move from Liverpool . 'The panel found in particular that FC Barcelona had breached the rules regarding the protection of minors and the registration of minors attending football academies. 'The FIFA decision is confirmed in full and the sanction remains in force.' Barca's appeal to CAS forced a delay of the initial ban and allowed them to sign Luis Suarez, Ivan Rakitic and Thomas Vermaelen among others during the last summer transfer window. But the CAS decision means the suspension will now be in effect during the January window and the summer spending period. Barcelona will only be allowed to add to their squad from January 2016. The Liga de Futbol Profesional (LFP) issued a statement later on Tuesday in which it expressed its concern that other Spanish clubs could find themselves in the same situation, and saying it may take the case to the European Union. It also backed Barca's insistence that they had acted correctly throughout, and labelled the club's La Masia youth academy as 'a world example'. 'We consider that the sanction can only be classified as totally disproportionate, inappropriate and unrelated to the errors, since it involves a disproportionate punishment for FC Barcelona, taking into account the behaviour and the circumstances of the case,' a statement on www.lfp.es read. 'As a result of this existing conflict, to properly protect the interests of under-age players, the current model of Spanish football and the because other Spanish clubs can be found in a similar situation, the LFP is conducting a review of the adequacy of the different rules of FIFA, as well as the different standards of the European Union, and based on this will consider the possibility of reporting to the European Union the current regulation of the transfer of under-age players.'","Barcelona were sanctioned for breaching rules on signing international players under the age of 18 .

"Robin van Persie will delay his start to the Premier League season in order to improve his fitness after missing Manchester United’s tour to America. New United manager Louis van Gaal says the striker won’t be in the team to face Swansea City in his side’s opening game on August 16, even though his partnership with Wayne Rooney is seen as key to regaining a Champions League spot. Van Persie, 31 this week, will begin his pre-season training at United’s Aon complex tomorrow, having taken an extended break in the Caribbean following Holland’s run to the World Cup semi-finals. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Van Persie to miss start of season . Not in shape: Robin van Persie will miss the start of Manchester United's season in order to regain fitness . Stern: Louis van Gaal insists that all his players are in top shape ahead of the new season . VIDEO Van Persie to miss start of season . Partnership: Van Persie shone for Van Gaal's Holland at the World Cup in Brazil this summer . He had injury problems last season and although he is keen to play as soon as possible, Van Gaal has ruled him out of United’s friendly against Valencia on August 12 and the Premier League opener four days later. The United manager, speaking from the club’s pre-season tournament camp in Detroit, said: ‘I’m sure he won’t play in those games. He has to train. I’m sorry, but when you have three weeks’ holiday you need training sessions, not a game. ‘Everyone can criticise me but I know what you have to do with players who have had that length of holiday. The player himself always wants to play but the other 30 players want to play also.’ Van Persie has scored 48 goals in 63 starts during two seasons at United and enjoys a close relationship with Van Gaal, but the former Holland manager substituted his star forward in the World Cup quarter-final against Costa Rica and won’t give him any special treatment at Old Trafford, even though he is a candidate to be the club’s captain. Chance: Wayne Rooney will lead the line for United when the new season kicks off . Stress-free: Van Persie has been enjoying his extended time off from football . Van Persie missed six weeks with a knee injury towards the end of last season and David Moyes, then the United manager, was accused of working him too hard. After United play Swansea, they have a relatively comfortable run of fixtures in August and September against Sunderland, Burnley, QPR, Leicester and West Ham, allowing Van Gaal to take his time. The Dutchman has also won a guarantee that the club will not arrange friendlies, in which they could earn several million pounds, when other clubs are playing Champions League fixtures this autumn. In discussions with executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, Van Gaal has asked for and received a 10-week amnesty in which he can train with his players without the distractions of money-spinning friendlies to make up the financial shortfall caused by United’s failure to qualify for Europe. Fanfare: But Louis van Gaal didn't appreciate all the travelling in America this summer for friendlies . Van Gaal said: ‘I need preparation of 10 weeks and I am lucky Manchester United are not playing in a European competition to do this. ‘We have discussed the issue of friendly matches and for the first 10 weeks we have to train. After that it is different and we will wait to see if we have a chance to play some matches. ‘It will also depend on the opponent. It has to be a good opponent like this tournament in America.’ The compromise has been reached after Van Gaal complained that United’s 13,500-mile pre-season tour of America had hampered his plans. However, it raises the prospect of them jetting abroad in December to play against other clubs who are out of Europe when the final group games are played in the Champions League or when the competition returns at the knockout stage in the spring.","Van Persie has enjoyed extended break after World Cup with Holland .

"A new phase in the search for MH370 is set to begin, five months after the Malaysia Airlines flight disappeared without a trace. The next phase of the search, led by Australian authorities, will see underwater vehicles slowly scan 60,000 square km of the sea floor – an area approximately the size of Tasmania –  in the southern Indian Ocean, off the west coast of Australia. 'We are cautiously optimistic we will locate the missing aircraft in the search zone,' Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said today. Scroll down for video . The search will concentrate on a 60,000 sq km section off the west coast, roughly the size of Tasmania . There has been no sign of the missing Malaysia Airlines plane, which was flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board, since it lost contact with air traffic control on March 8, 2014 as it was transitioning between Malaysian and Vietnamese airspace. The new phase of the search will commence in September and will involved underwater vehicles, towed by manned surface vessels, searching the ocean floor using side-scan sonars. The sonar data will be sent to the vessels and interpreted by personnel on board and then reviewed by analysts on shore. Over the last few months the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) has been conducting a bathymetric survey to map the sea floor in the search area. So far 32,000 sq km of the 60,000 sq km search zone, which is approximately 80km wide and 700km long, has been mapped. Martin Dolan, Chief Commissioner of the ATSB, said the bathymetric survey is a crucial step before commencing the underwater search, revealing underwater volcanoes, canyons and valleys, which could make debris difficult to spot. The new search phase will concentrate on the area in close proximity to the 7th arc, which reaches from latitude 20 degrees south to 39 degrees south. It is believed that at the time MH370 reached this arc, the aircraft exhausted its fuel supply and began descending, leading search teams to believe the aircraft is unlikely to be more than 38 km west or 55 km east of the arc. Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss (left), along with Mr Martin Dolan, Chief Commissioner, Australian Transport Safety Bureau announced the new phase of the search for MH370 . The search will involved unmanned underwater vehicles with sonar capabilities that will send data to vessels for analysis . The underwater search will be concentrated in the area around the 7th arc, which is believed to be where the plane ran out of fuel and began its descent . The government has contracted Dutch company Fugro to conduct the search operation, which will cost up to $52 million. Two Fugro vessels will be engaged in the search - the Fugro Equator and the Fugro Discovery, which is currently en route to Australia from the UK. The Australian government has committed to spending $80-$90 million on the MH370 search operation. Mr Truss said the government saw the search as their responsibility to the international community, but added he would be in discussions with Malaysian officials and representatives of other governments about sharing the cost of the operation. Mr Truss added that it was not clear how long the operation would take. 'Obviously we hope to find it on the first day, but it could take a year,' he said. Mr Truss said the search for the wreckage of MH370 was 'on schedule' and had not been affected by downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, from Amsterdam to Melbourne, which was believed to be shot down over Ukraine, killing all 298 passengers and crew on board on July 17. 'Obviously Malaysia Airlines and the Malaysian government have to deal with... two extraordinary circumstances, two unique situations to deal with,' he said. The search for the missing plane has been led by Australia and conducted out of RAAF Base Pearce in Perth.

Initial analysis of radar data and satellite communication messages following the disappearance of MH370 indicated it most likely crashed in the southern Indian Ocean, 2,500km south-west of Perth. But despite an international search effort led by Australia and operated out of the Pearce Air Force base in Perth, no debris from the plane has been found. The first phase of the search for the missing plane was a surface search of probable impact areas, conducted by an international fleet of aircraft and ships, which concluded on April 28. An acoustic search, accompanied by a search of the ocean floor in the vicinity of the acoustic detentions was then conducted, also without success. The ocean floor search was completed on May 28.","A new phase in the search for MH370 will commence in September .

"Having given Liverpool a fright and taken his hero’s shirt, Adebayo Akinfenwa issued a warning that Steven Gerrard must not be allowed to leave Anfield. ‘To lose him, boy, I don’t know the future, but it will be a problem,’ said Akinfenwa, who rattled his beloved Reds with an equaliser for AFC Wimbledon in the FA Cup third round before Gerrard won it with a free-kick to fuel the debate about his plans to move to the United States. ‘You can see he was the difference. If he didn’t play, it would have been a different story. He was miles better than anybody on the pitch. Sometimes when you play against people you can just use the word “class”. That’s what it is. Two moments of magic won the game. Steven Gerrard looks on as his free-kick goes over the wall on its way to securing Liverpool a 2-1 victory . Lifelong Liverpool supporter Adebayo Akinfenwa poses with Gerrard's shirt after the game . ‘I’m not trying to blow no smoke up anywhere. I’m saying he is the difference and Liverpool will lose that. I don’t want to see him go. Not just as a Liverpool supporter but as a lover of football. He will be a massive miss.’ Akinfenwa swapped shirts with Gerrard after the final whistle. ‘I just spoke to him quickly,’ he said. ‘I was like: “Look, don’t go, I’m a fan, please don’t go, man”. He just smiled. Nobody can begrudge Steven Gerrard doing what he wants to do. He’s been a legend. If he needs to go to pastures new, so be it. ‘It is down to Liverpool to try to do everything to keep him and get him to stay, but if he has made his mind up, he has made his mind up. All you can do is wish him on his merry way and hope he comes back as manager one day.’ Gerrard runs away in celebration after giving Premier League outfit Liverpool the lead against Wimbledon . The FA Cup tie was Gerrard’s first game since confirming his decision to leave Liverpool when his contract expires at the end of this season and play in the MLS. Brendan Rodgers claimed the decision had been taken after much consideration on Gerrard’s part and that it would be the perfect send-off if his captain could go on to win the FA Cup at Wembley on May 30, his 35th birthday. They are at home to Bolton in round four. The debate, however, will rage on, especially if Gerrard can influence games in the Barclays Premier League games as he did the one at Wimbledon, and if fellow 30-somethings Frank Lampard, John Terry and Didier Drogba keep performing well at the top of the league. ‘He is so technically gifted, so you play to his strengths,’ said 32-year-old Akinfenwa. ‘Pirlo is the direct comparison. As you get older, you ain’t going to have the legs to keep going up and down, so you adapt your game and you adapt the formation to play his game.’ Gerrard is mobbed by his Liverpool team-mates after scoring the winner at Kingsmeadow . Wimbledon return to League Two duties at Stevenage on Saturday, but they will not forget the night they pushed Liverpool all the way and muscular striker Akinfenwa, after more than a decade journeying around England’s lower leagues, scored past Simon Mignolet. ‘To score against them, it is stuff I couldn’t have dreamed of,’ he said. ‘The only thing better was if we beat them 2-1 or drew 1-1 and took it back to Anfield. I did two of three things. I played and I scored. I can’t put it into words. ‘I was giddy. I was seeing stars, green clovers. I was thinking: “Is it?” Then I did a little jig with Callum Kennedy. It was surreal. ‘We’re a League Two team and it don’t come around much when you’re standing alongside Stevie G and the rest of the Liverpool team. I got the shirt — I told you I would get it — and if not I would have had to beat up my team-mates. Akinfenwa runs away in celebration after 'the Beast' gave Wimbledon hope against Liverpool . ‘I’ll be able to look back at it and say I was on the pitch with one of the greatest English players of my generation. I truly hope and pray that he lifts the FA Cup on his 35th birthday. We’d be able to say that the team that beat us were the ones that won it.’ Meanwhile, former Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar has claimed that Liverpool will be in ‘disarray’ when Gerrard leaves . The six-time League winner told talkSPORT: ‘I, and many of the other former players, are surprised that the Fenway Sports Group [Liverpool’s owners], and the management structure, don’t want Steven Gerrard to stay until the end of his career. ‘I would give him games week in and week out. He’s still a leader and we still need him. Liverpool still rely on him a lot, he delivers, as he did against Wimbledon. ‘He was the only one who came up to scratch and got the two goals. What are they going to rely on next season? Who is going to be leading this club? If you don’t have a person like Gerrard, then the club might be in disarray.’ Callum Kennedy's clearance denied Gerrard a hat-trick against the League Two Dons .","Steven Gerrard has announced he will leave Liverpool in the summer .

"A new treatment could help millions suffering from rosacea - a skin disorder causing embarrassing facial redness. The skin gel is the first prescription drug available on the NHS to dramatically cut facial flushing within half an hour. The effect lasts for up to 12 hours, according to clinical trials. A new treatment could help millions of people suffering from rosacea by reducing facial redness. Image shows the effect the gel had on one patient's symptoms . The active ingredient, brimonidine, restricts excessive blood flow to the upper layers of the skin. Previous treatments, including laser therapy, oral and topical antibiotics, have had limited success. Dr Anton Alexandroff, Consultant Dermatologist at University Hospitals Leicester, said: 'Rosacea is often misunderstood and until now we have been extremely limited in the options we can offer people suffering from facial redness. 'Typically the symptoms associated with rosacea get worse if left untreated so it's key that we recognise and treat this condition.' Many sufferers give up going to the GP as existing treatments tend to deal with inflammation and pus-filled spots rather than the redness, he said. 'It's very embarrassing for patients and there is no current treatment for the redness,' said Dr Alexandroff. The gel works by reducing the excess flow of blood to the upper layers of the skin. It is effective for up to 12 hours. Image shows one patient's face before treatment and at regular intervals after treatment . Pop star Ricky Wilson, lead singer with the Kaiser Chiefs and judge on BBC's The Voice, is among an estimated six million Britons suffering from the problem. The condition is often mistaken for adult acne, but in its severe stages can make the nose appear deformed, red and bulbous. Around six million Britons suffer from the chronic skin disorder rosacea, with famous sufferers including former U.S. president Bill Clinton and Kaiser Chiefs singer Ricky Wilson, who is a judge on BBC's The Voice. It causes characteristic facial redness and spots affecting the forehead, cheeks, around the mouth and particularly the nose, which can look red and swollen. It typically begins after the age of 30, with middle-aged women often affected because of hot flushes during the menopause. The problem, which may get worse if left untreated, can cause some people to be so embarrassed by their appearance they become social recluses. Surveys show seven in 10 sufferers feel rosacea has sapped their self-confidence, while two in five have avoided being seen in public and cancelled social plans. One in three admits to calling in sick at work because of rosacea. Treatments such as oral and topical antibiotics, as well as laser therapy, have limited success. London dermatologist David Fenton said the biggest danger was the damage to people's confidence and the danger of 'over-focusing' on their appearance. He said: 'The emotional and psychological turmoil caused by skin conditions should never be under-estimated. 'When the face is affected, the individual can become very self-conscious and may get it out of perspective. 'Medical advice can prevent patients from aggravating it, by avoiding spicy foods, alcohol and hot rooms.' Psychotherapy can help sufferers who find it hard to cope with social situations, he added. Rosacea's exact cause is unknown but . chronic inflammation is believed to play a critical role in causing . redness affecting the nose, forehead, cheeks and around the mouth. It can be aggravated by certain triggers including heat, cold, intense physical exercise, alcohol and caffeine. Doctors . advise dietary and lifestyle adjustments like avoiding key triggers . while some patients benefit from anti-inflammatory antibiotics. GP Dr Ellie Cannon said: 'Many people underestimate the impact of the flushing and redness associated with rosacea: if it is not appropriately managed it can severely impact a person's life, causing anxiety, embarrassment, low self-esteem and isolation. 'It is often discounted simply as blushing but the sad truth is that people are judged negatively as a result of this very visible condition.' There have been reports of sufferers committing suicide because of the problems caused by rosacea. Made by Galderma, a tube of Mirvaso costs the NHS around £34 and lasts two months. It is a clear gel applied all over the face in pea-sized amounts once every 24 hours. The anti-redness effect works for up to 12 hours, according to clinical trials involving 553 patients where it was compared with a dummy gel over four weeks. There was a 'significant difference' within 30 minutes on the first day of use and up to one third of patients responded to the drug. The most common side effects were redness, itching and a burning sensation of the skin. Brimodine tartrate, the active substance in Mirvaso, works by causing blood vessels of the skin to narrow, which reduces blood flow to the face thus decreasing the redness. Dr Alexandroff said the ingredient had been used for some time in eye drops and had a good safety record. London consultant dermatologist David Fenton said the drug gives an extra option to patients who don't want to embark on drug therapy or even laser treatment. He said: 'Until now the treatment options have been fairly few and limited. They don't tend to target the redness and flushing which is often the most embarrassing part. 'It is one of those situations where superficially observers think that it is just a cosmetic issue but for the sufferer it can cause huge embarrassment and limit them socially, and cause psychological problems.'","The skin gel is the first drug available on the NHS to cut redness .

"Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal is fighting to improve the club's style of play, according to his compatriot Ronald de Boer.

"Education secretary Michael Gove, who has now publicly backed free school meals for five to seven-year-olds . Michael Gove has been forced to formally declare the end of hostilities in a row over free school meals. The education secretary now says he passionately advocates the policy. He had been at war with Nick Clegg and David Laws, his Liberal Democrat ministerial deputy, over free lunches for pupils aged from five to seven. But in a joint newspaper article today, he and Mr Laws try to laugh off their differences, claiming their image as foes in a disaster movie was wide of the mark and that they are now both firmly behind the idea. The about-turn comes quickly after David Cameron and Mr Clegg ordered them to stop feuding following a series of public briefings against each other. Conservatives are concerned about the rising costs of the policy, which has been enthusiastically promoted by Deputy Prime Minister Mr Clegg. Last Friday, private emails showed Mr Gove had warned that giving an extra £80million to help implement the policy risked affecting the quality of teaching and learning. Lib Dem sources branded Mr Gove an ‘ideological zealot’ and Mr Laws, unusually, failed to appear alongside the education secretary in the Commons this week. But, writing in the Times newspaper, the pair try to bury the hatchet and claim the plan to give free school meals to younger infant pupils at a cost of £1billion, has ‘genuine cross-party support’. The pair say the policy will be a challenge to implement although most schools seem to be on track. They played down the whole row, explaining: ‘To judge from the latest breathless headlines, you might expect the two of us to be crouched under our desks like the last survivors in a Bruce Willis movie, only popping out occasionally to blast each other with shotguns.’ They claim the priority of both coalition partners is now ‘improving education not fighting political battles’. They conceded there will be ‘challenges with the implementation of the policy’ which begins across England and Wales in September. The free school meals policy has been enthusiastically promoted by deputy prime minster Nick Clegg, pictured centre . ‘Some schools will find it easier than other to expand their catering services to meet this increased demand, but at present the overwhelming majority of schools already seem to be on track’, they said. They went on: ‘Long after the current political spats are forgotten and our own political careers have ended, this policy will be helping create a generation of young people who are healthier, happier and doing better in their studies.’ ‘We are certainly both passionate advocates of this policy and working together we are determined to ensure a successful delivery’, they concluded. This week Mr Gove’s former special adviser, Dominic Cummings, accused the Lib Dem leader of lying about the funding of free school meals to cover up an ‘abuse of taxpayers’ money’. At the weekend, the Liberal Democrats hit back, accusing Mr Gove of ‘lunacy’ for draining £400million from key budgets to fill a black hole in funding for his flagship free schools project. The Education Secretary was called to the Commons on Tuesday to answer an Urgent Question about free schools. In an apparent sign of Coalition tensions, however, Mr Laws did not appear alongside him, as would be customary. Last night an ally of Mr Gove denied he was told off, saying he felt it was time to ‘move on’.","Education Secretary now says he passionately advocates free school meals .

"An American home builder has decided to capitalize on the puppy pampering phenomenon by offering specially fitted amenities for dogs, on top of the usual optional extras buyers can expect. Standard Pacific Homes is building homes across the country from Florida to California offering the suites, costing up to $35,000, which include features such as showers  for puppies and automated feeders. The company, based in Irvine, California say they decided to offer pet suites after conducting livability studies with home owners. One of the pet suites, which comes inside a Standard Pacific Home, which features a dog shower, special built-in cabinets and specially designed dog bunk-beds. The suites can come complete with a washing station for small dogs, left, and special dog cubby holes can be created on the staircase, right . The washing stations can also be adapted to accommodate bigger dogs so pet owners don't have to use their own bath or kitchen sink . Jeffrey Lake, vice president and national director of architecture for Standard Pacific said: 'Devotion to pets is second-to-none. They are family.' One of the most lavish suites that can be installed is described as a 170-square-foot pet paradise, which comes complete with a step-in wash station, a handheld sprayer and a leash lead. It also has a water station and automated feeders so pets never go hungry or thirsty, a large bunk-style bed and special cabinets for treats and food. Meanwhile other home builders have reported adapting already-built houses for pet owners with features such as chip activated doors so dogs can go outdoors whenever they please. Cabinets and cupboards in the suites are fitted at the right height so that dogs can have easy access to them, left, while a built-in crate at the bottom of the stairs, right, allows the dog to see who is coming in and out of the front door . Standard Pacific Homes' newest community, called Avignon at Blackstone in Brea, about 25 miles south of Los Angeles, features homes that start at $710,000. The pet spa option adds $35,000 to the price. Only the largest suite is available in Brea, but in some of the other communities, there are smaller sizes and prices, starting at 60 square feet for $8,000. During some of the model grand openings at different communities, several potential buyers brought their dogs to look at the homes, said Danielle Tocco, the company's director of communications. The American Pet Products Association reports that 68 per cent of Americans own pets and contribute to an industry worth more than $55 billion annually . She also added that pet adoptions were held at some openings just in case potential buyers didn't have a dog but wanted one. One pet owner who splashed out on a pet package for their dog Lola is Melanie Dean, who lives with her family in a Standard Pacific Home near Dallas. She said: 'Lola's room makes life much easier. We don't have to use the kitchen sink to wash yucky stuff anymore.' Amy Bohutinsky, chief marketing officer at Seattle-based Zillow said pet washrooms can also be used as multi-purpose rooms, which are always popular with buyers . But despite the additional features being aimed specifically at dogs, estate agents believe the suites can add value to the price of homes.

"John Robert, a Bolton businessman has made £86million in a day after selling off part of his 'white goods' website . An entrepreneur who set up his business for a £1 bet took home £86million in a single day after its stockmarket debut. John Roberts left school without any qualifications and earned the nickname the ‘Kitchen King’ after creating household appliance website AO.com 14 years ago. After the Bolton-based business was floated on the Stock Exchange on Wednesday, its value soared to a staggering £1.6billion. He went home with £86million after cashing in 10 per cent of his near 40 per cent stake in the company. The value of shares in his remaining 28.6 per cent stake rocketed by £113million to around £458million – making the 40-year-old the equivalent of nearly £3,500 a second during the nine hours of trading. The total value of the company is now only just smaller than rival Dixons, which makes around 15 times more in annual profits. Mr Roberts, a married father of five, started AO.com after a bet made in a pub when he worked selling kitchen appliances for a distribution warehouse. ‘Like all the best businesses, it started in the pub,’ he told Retail Week. ‘It was Christmas Eve and I was having a drink with Alan Latchford [of parent company DRL Ltd]. He bet me a pound I wouldn’t do it.’ Mr Roberts said he had not heard of the internet at the time, but he used his knowledge of his sector to assemble a database while Mr Latchford – who had internet experience – built the website. He realised the long supply chain for white goods such as washing machines, fridges and cookers was adding needless costs for customers, so he cut out the middlemen to keep his prices low. Success story: AO.com smashed expectations for its stock market debut with a 33 per cent rise that increased the worth of Mr Roberts by £113million in less than nine hours of trading . A recent AO television advert. Mr Roberts also says the key to his success is the company's customer service and his approach towards his staff . The rise of internet sites and the . tech industry in general, created a bubble which is generally defined as . the period of investment . and speculation in Internet firms that occurred between 1995 and 2001. A major growth in internet . users during this time led to many Internet start-ups being born in the mid to late 1990s. Many of these companies engaged in unusual and . daring business practices with the hopes of dominating the market as well as engaging in a policy of growth over profit. At the peak of the dot-com bubble in 1999, it was said that a new millionaire was created every 60 seconds in Silicon Valley. But many argue that the dotcom boom and bust was a case of too much too fast. On 10 March 2000, the Nasdaq index of leading technology shares spiked, bursting the Dotcom bubble. Investors soon realised that the dot-com dream had devolved into a classic speculative bubble. They were left counting their losses as panic selling ensued as the . stock market’s value plunged. Companies such as Boo.com, Clickmango.com, Ready2Shop.com, Pets.com went from being leaders of a revolution to the losers. Survivors such as Lastminute.com, were left desperately trying to stay afloat. He . said: ‘When we started it was all done on dial-up internet. You’d . refresh the page, go and make a cup of tea and it would have loaded. 'There had to be a very good reason for you to do the 110-metre hurdles . to get on the site – and that was price. ‘It was 25 per cent cheaper than Currys or Comet.’ AO.com . – formerly Appliances Online – sells goods directly via its website and . also for high street chains including Tesco, Argos, B&Q, Next, . Debenhams and House of Fraser. It is the UK’s largest online domestic appliance retailer, with a 24 per cent share of the market.But . the key to success is being ‘fanatical about service’ and having a ‘fun . working culture’, said Mr Roberts. His 1,000 employees are given access . to gym membership and free chocolates and crisps. He claims he spent . £50,000 on crisps last year. ‘We make more money the less we worry about . making money,’ he said. The company plans to use funds from the . float to expand in Europe, starting in Germany. However, analysts have . warned that the valuation of AO.com at more than five times its annual . sales of £275million could lead to a crash similar to the dotcom bubble, . when technology companies saw huge leaps in value in the late 1990s . before plummeting in 2001. Several other retail chains are expected . to float this year, including Poundland, Pets at Home, DFS, House of . Fraser and B&M Bargains.

"A British clergyman has described how he was among the first on the scene of the Sandy Hook school shooting - and was with the families when they heard the news their children had died. Rev Clive Calver, who was born in London but now leads the Walnut Hill Community Church, in Conneticut, took the funeral of Dylan Hockley, the six-year-old British boy who was killed when crazed gunman Adam Lanza went on a rampage which left 20 children and six teachers dead at Sandy Hook Elementary School, . Dylan, who suffered from autism, died cradled in the arms of his devoted special needs teacher Anne Marie Murphy who was also killed. Rev Clive Calver, left, was among the first on the scene and held the funeral of British victim six-year-old Dylan Hockley, right . Dylan's funeral was held at the Walnut Hill Community Church on Friday . His father Ian Hockley, 42, moved his family from Eastleigh, Hampshire, to Newtown, Connecticut, two years ago in the belief that America would give his boys – Dylan and big brother Jake, eight – a better start in life. The priest described how he arrived at the church on the Friday morning when one of his staff was stood outside saying 'There's been a shooting'. Rev Calver said: 'We knew that it was his son's school. So we jumped in a car, praying our way through the 12-minute drive. The call came through that his son was alive.' He was the first clergyman on the scene where hundreds of confused children and worried parents were milling around. He said he had to put his experience as president of disaster response charity World Relief to use to help bring order to the situation. He said: 'I never dreamed I would have to do this in sleepy Newtown.' A couple embraces while looking at a memorial for those killed in the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut yesterday . He put his church's 22 pastors to work, helping out at the school, in the hospital and town hall, he said. One of the pastors, Crag Mowrey, who joined Rev Calver at the scene, recalled: 'One by one, children were being found by their parents. It was total chaos. 'And then you started to get parents asking, ""Where's my child? Nobody dreamed they were dead."" Meanwhile a woman lights candles at yesterday's memorial for those killed . 'Five hours after the shooting, shaking with fear, we approached the first set of state troopers and they let us in to the fire house where parents were waiting. 'The tension was incredible. Most of them hadn't been watching the news. They were clearly hoping upon hope that their child or family member was one of the ones being treated at the hospital. 'We had an opportunity to pray for folks and minister to them. There was very much the unknown in that moment.' Adam Lanza shot dead his mother and then went on a gun rampage at the Connecticut school leaving 26 dead . He and Rev Calver were with the families when Conneticut governor Dannel Malloy broke the news that their children were among the dead. Mr Mowrey said: 'In that moment, all of them knew that those they were waiting for - they were never going to see them again. There was terror and shock and anger. 'Some just sat completely comatose. It was a terrible situation. People also found out that they weren't going to be able to recover their children's bodies as it was a crime scene. 'We helped to usher people out of that room, and most of them did the only thing they could do - go home.' Rev Calver has continued to give support and counselling to families in Newtown, where he lives, following America's worst school massacre on the morning of December 14 . He said the church has opened a fund to help provide long-term counselling services for local residents in Newtown. He said: 'We know this is not going to be over tomorrow. The world will have forgotten this in a month or two. 'But we will still be living with it. When you say 'Dunblane', you don't think of Andy Murray, you think of the tragedy that happened there. 'There is a shadow of grief that has been cast over this town.

"David Moyes has revealed that having overweight players in his Manchester United squad was the reason he banned chips. The Real Sociedad boss, who was sacked by United in April last year after less than a season in charge, came in for criticism from Rio Ferdinand after removing chips from the players' menu. But Moyes insists his decision was for the right reasons, even if some members of his squad weren't happy with their traditional pre-match meal being tampered with. Real Sociedad boss David Moyes has revealed his reason for banning chips while at Manchester United . Moyes, pictured in training with his United players last March, says he had overweight players in his squad . Midfielder Anderson, who signed for Internacional on deadline day, struggled with his weight at Old Trafford . Moyes speaks in the March edition of FourFourTwo . In an interview with FourFourTwo, Moyes said: 'Yes, I did ban chips. 'It was because a couple of players were overweight and I didn't think chips were good for their diet.' In his autobiography #2sides, Ferdinand wrote that it was a 'ritual' to have 'low-fat chips the night before a game'. The QPR defender, who left Old Trafford at the end of last season, also said the United players 'loved' their chips but within a week of taking charge Moyes had banned them 'for no good reason'. Ferdinand claimed 'all the lads were p***** off' with the decision, while adding that chips returned to the menu as soon as Ryan Giggs took temporary charge after Moyes' departure. Midfielder Anderson, who left United to sign for Internacional on deadline day, had problems with his weight during his eight-year spell at Old Trafford. Speaking to the Manchester Evening News shortly after Moyes' arrival in the summer of 2013, the Brazilian said: 'Training is hard under David Moyes but that's good for me. I need to train hard. I need to run and I'm feeling good, with power in my legs. 'I need to get fit and lose weight. I need to lose two more kilos to be at my best weight.'

"Radamel Falcao should have joined Chelsea, Liverpool or Real Madrid last summer as Manchester United didn't need to sign him, according to Monaco boss Leonardo Jardim. The Colombian striker has struggled for form since moving to Old Trafford on a season-long loan and it appears increasingly unlikely that United will spend £43million to sign him permanently this summer. Jardim admits that he expected Falcao to leave the Ligue 1 side last August, although he was surprised at his destination. Radamel Falcao was an unused substitute as Manchester United lost 2-1 at Swansea on Saturday . Falcao, pictured after missing a chance against Leicester last month, has only scored four goals this season . The striker was taken off after another disappointing display against League One Preston last week . Speaking to The Sun, Jardim said: 'In the last days of August I was thinking Falcao would leave - but I thought he'd go to another club. 'In England other teams wanted him. But I didn't think United would be the ones taking him as they had Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney.' 'Maybe they did not need him. It's my opinion but not my decision to make.' Liverpool were keen on Falcao last summer, while Real Madrid have a long-term interest in the former Porto forward. Monaco boss Leonardo Jardim believes Falcao should have joined Chelsea, Liverpool or Real Madrid . United have the option to sign Falcao permanently this summer but they appear unlikely to do so . And Jardim, who is preparing his side to face Arsenal in the last 16 of the Champions League, believes a move elsewhere may have benefited the 29-year-old. 'I think other clubs needed him more, such as Chelsea, Manchester City or Liverpool,' he said. 'I think at that moment it would have been easier to go to Chelsea, Liverpool or even Real Madrid.'","Radamel Falcao has struggled for form since joining Manchester United .

"A ship found off the coast of Cornwall could be a pirate vessel that sank more than 350 years ago. Shipwreck hunter Todd Stevens believes the 80ft craft belonged to legendary privateer John Mucknell, known as the Pirate King of Scilly. The John was originally a 44-gun East . India Company frigate but its swashbuckling skipper Captain John . Mucknell became a privateer just before the start of the civil war in . 1643. Discovery: Tod Stevens holds one of the artefacts he found on what he believes is a 17th century pirate ship . He ran aground his ship, The John, in 1645, after it was damaged in a battle with sailors sent by Charles I. Since then, its exact location has remained a mystery. He joined a fleet of smaller vessels based on the Scillies which raided ships in the Western Approaches and seized them and their cargoes. Captain Mucknell was a staunch Royalist and his predations may have enjoyed semi official approval from Charles I, whose coffers would have been boosted by his loot. He spent two years as a pirate until he was tracked down by three Parliamentary warships in 1645 and his ship was mauled in a naval battle close to the Scillies. Deep blue sea: Todd Stevens dives in what is believed to be The John's remains, 44 gun frigate belonging to John Mucknell . He then grounded it on a reef and . escaped onto the islands along with most of his crew but the location of . the wreck has remained a mystery which has baffled naval historians for . years. Captain Mucknell himself returned to . the mainland where he was taken back into the mainstream Royalist Navy, . knighted, and promoted to vice admiral. He carried on fighting until the end of the Civil War in 1649 when he fled to Portugal. Diver Todd Stevens is convinced that a . large wreck he has located near the Scillies is the John. Artefacts . recovered from the sea bed date it to the Civil War period. The wreck is 80 foot long and too . large to be one of the many small traders which foundered on the Isles . at the time or one of the lesser pirate ships in the ten-strong fleet. Experts are due to dive on the wreck . in the next few weeks and it could receive protected status as an . important underwater historical site if the identity is confirmed. Mr Stevens has found a treasure trove of artefacts, including a thin silver coin imprinted during the reign of Charles I. He said the story of The John and its colourful captain read like the script of a Hollywood blockbuster. ‘It’s like a movie - John Mucknell wasn’t even 50 when he died, but he lived an amazing life, any part of which would make a great film, but looked at together is almost unreal,’ he said. Describing the find, Mr Stevens added: ‘I followed the lines in the sand and found there was more and more. Artefacts: Todd Stevens examines some of the evidence which he claims shows that the shipwreck off the Cornish coast is the missing 17th century pirate ship skippered by legendary seaman John Mucknell . ‘I was fighting the tide, but I could dig in with my hands to hold on. ‘I could tell it was a very big vessel, had been armed and from the construction technique that it was pre-1750. ‘But I could also tell it had been run aground because the bow was pointing into the land.’ Mr Stevens said: ‘There was already a rag tag bunch of pirates at Scilly, but Mucknell and his huge ship, the John, became the flagship, and all the pirates rallied under his banner. ‘There were about 11 ships in all, pillaging other ships, kidnapping people and conducting raids. ‘The Prince of Wales was petitioned about him and wrote to his father, the King. ‘Parliament was under pressure to act and in 1645 sent in the three ships to Scilly to stop this pirate.’ In the aftermath of the pitched battle, the damaged John was run aground by her captain, who then fled to Ireland. Ironically, it seemed crime did pay for Captain Mucknell, whose support for the King won him a knighthood, a promotion to vice-admiral and the command of another ship. Hidden treasure: Mr Stevens reads the historical records detailing how The John sank in 1645 after it was damaged in battle . He then returned to Scilly and, Mr Stevens claims ‘carried on where he left off’ up until the execution of Charles I in 1649, when he escaped to Portugal. Alison James, maritime archaeologist with the organisation, said it could end up being Britain’s newest protected shipwreck site. She said: ‘It is of interest because it is a very early vessel. ‘We know the John was a Royalist vessel and we know it was lost in 1645. ‘This is a preliminary investigation, but it could turn out to be of huge historical significance.’","Ship 'belonged to the Pirate King of Scilly' in the mid-1600s'

"A riot involving 2,000 workers broke out at an Apple factory in China, leaving 40 people injured. More than 5,000 police were reportedly sent to bring the riot at the Foxconn factory in the northern city of Taiyuan in the Shanxi province of China until control after trouble erupted in workers' sleeping quarters yesterday. Comments on Chinese internet bulletin . boards said the trouble may have been sparked by a security guard . hitting an employee and not related to the recent anti-Japan protests. In a statement, the Taiwanese-owned company said: 'A personal dispute between several employees escalated into an incident involving some 2,000 workers at approximately 11pm last night in a privately-managed dormitory.' Rubbish lines the road and a broken window can be seen in the background during the riots at the Foxconn factory in northern China which lasted for four hours . Around 2,000 workers at the Foxconn factory in the northern Chinese city . of Taiyuan were involved in a mass brawl last night and 40 people were . taken to hospital . The rioting at the factory which employs 79,000 workers continued for four hours, with 40 people being taken to hospital and a 'number of individuals being arrested'. Production at the plant has been stopped today and the cause of the dispute is being investigated by local authorities. The company spokesman added 'it does not appear to have been work-related'. Foxconn makes iPhones and iPads for Apple and also assembles products for Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard. It is one of China's biggest employers, with some 1.2 million workers in factories in Taiyuan, the southern city of Shenzhen, in Chengdu in the west and in Zhengzhou in central China. Photos uploaded by Li Tian to the Chinese site Sina Weibe were swiftly removed, but they show considerable damage including a burned vehicle, broken windows and lines of police with riot shields, helmets and clubs. Members of the military appear opposite the protesters on the streets outside the factor . A total of 5,000 police officers were called in to try and regain control of the situation . Fences appear to have been pulled down and manufacturing equipment broken during the riot . The rioting at the factory which employs 79,000 workers continued for four hours, with 40 people being taken to hospital and a 'number of individuals being arrested' The incident happened in the city of Taiyuan in the north of China, situated to the south-west of Beijing . This is the second time in the last six months the site has seen workers unrest at the site. In March front-line workers went on strike after they failed to receive the promised pay rise. Apple hired an auditor who found Foxconn employees regularly were required to work more than 60 hours a week. The company raised minimum pay and promised to limit hours. There was a riot at Foxconn's Chengdu plant in June, which according to reports was due to an argument between some workers and a local . restaurant owner. Last night's rioting in the Taiyuan factory comes 11 days after an undercover journalist for the Shanghai Evening Post  strongly criticised working conditions at the plant where 57million iPhones are produced every year. The journalist, who is keeping his identity secret, kept a diary of his ten day and website micgadget translated it. Comments on Chinese internet bulletin . boards said the trouble may have been sparked by a security guard . hitting an employee and not related to the recent anti-Japan protests . Foxconn, which produces the iPhone 5, says it has closed down production today after windows were broken, cars were burned and 5,000 police officers had to be called in . Referring to living conditions at the dormitory next to the plant he wrote: ''The first night sleeping at Foxconn dormitory is a nightmare. 'The whole dormitory smells like garbage when I walked in. 'It’s a mixed of overnight garbage smell plus dirty sweat and foam smell. 'Outside every room was fully piled up with uncleared trash. 'When . I opened my wardrobe, lots of cockroaches crawl out from inside and the . bedsheets that are being distributed to every new workers are full of . dirts and ashes. 'When . someone has asked about the suicide issues, the management staff didn’t . avoid the topic but not willing to discuss too much on it. 'During the suicide topic discussion, someone has voiced out that the bad living environment will sure lead to more suicides. An investigation has been launched to find out what triggered the riot, it follows a strike at the factory in March over pay and working hours . 'Also I have noticed that all the windows in the dormitory has been framed behind bars.' Describing the relentless production-line work he was asked to carry out the journalist added: . 'I have terrible neck-ache and muscle . pain on my arm. A new worker who sat opposite of me got exhausted and . laid down for a short while. 'The supervisor has noticed him and punished him by asking him to stand at one corner for 10 minutes like the old school days. 'We . worked non-stop from midnight to the next morning 6 a.m but were still . asked to keep on working as the production line is based on running belt . and no one is allowed to stop. I’m so starving and fully exhausted. 'By . my own calculations, I have to mark five iPhone plates every minute, at . least.

"This is the first picture of a father who shot and fatally wounded his seven-year-old daughter amid a bitter custody battle with estranged wife. Yasser Alromisse, 46, who was born in Egypt, wanted custody of his daughter Mary Ann Shipstone after becoming estranged with his wife Lyndsey. After shooting his daughter, Alromisse took his own life inside a silver Toyota on the driveway of his ex-wife's home in Northiam, near Rye, East Sussex on Thursday. Yasser Alromisse shot and fatally wounded his daughter before taking his own life in Rye, East Sussex . Mary Ann Shipstone, pictured, died of her injuries yesterday after being shot twice in the head by Alromisse . A mother's love: Lyndsey Shipstone, 42, with her daughter Mary, who died in hospital yesterday after being shot . Yesterday afternoon, the little girl died in hospital after being gunned down by her ‘jealous’ estranged father. She was shot in the head by  Alromisse after his English convert wife rejected Islam and him. The youngster had returned from school and was excited about celebrating her eighth birthday next week. Her mother, Lyndsey Shipstone, 42, screamed: ‘He’s got a gun’ before her estranged Muslim husband shot Mary Ann and then killed himself. She raced outside, gathered her daughter in her arms and laid her on a sofa inside. Neighbour Helen Barber, 38, said: ‘I ran out up to the house and went in. Mary Ann was on the sofa. There was blood everywhere. Neighbours in the quiet village of Northiam, near Rye, East Sussex, described Mary as a 'lovely little girl' Scene of the attack: Residents who heard the shots said they thought someone was shooting pheasants . Villagers spoke of their shock at the horror in what is a leafy, quiet village near the border with Kent . ‘I couldn’t feel a pulse. I’ve done first aid before and she was showing no signs of life. Lyndsey was hysterical.’ Her husband, Stuart Barber, 46, added: ‘The car stopped. There were two shots. No one went to the car. Within minutes armed police turned up and surrounded the car.’ Miss Shipstone has an older son, Stephen, 21, who has autism and was with a carer when his sister was killed. He arrived home 15 minutes after the shooting and was taken away from the scene by Mr Barber. The estranged couple were involved in a bitter custody battle and Alromisse had spent a week trying to locate the home the family had moved to. It is thought he also staked out their £300,000 house in his Toyota Rav 4 car. One villager said he had heard the man had gone to his former partner's home and shot the youngster . This aerial shot shows the gunman's car, circled right with open doors, and his body covered by a blanket . Yesterday, Miss Shipstone posted the picture online of her daughter.Last night she was being consoled by her parents and siblings. In a statement the family said they were trying ‘to come to terms with what has happened,’ adding: ‘We are today grieving the death of our beautiful and loving Mary.’ Miss Shipstone’s Facebook post came as it emerged the family had been hiding from Alromisse for several years. The couple married in Liverpool in 2005 after Miss Shipstone converted to Islam, friends said. But she later rejected the faith and left him, prompting a bitter custody dispute over the children. Further legal action had apparently been planned in the past few weeks. While together, their daughter had been known by the traditional Islamic name Maryam. After her mother moved she started calling her ‘Mary Ann’. Locals said the little girl and her mother had moved to the quiet village of Northiam, near Rye, last April . A police spokesman said: 'At this stage we are not in a position to confirm the relationships of all those involved but we can say that the girl and the man knew each other' Miss Shipstone had also started a relationship with a new man, who Mary is seen clinging to in another photograph uploaded on to a social media site. Miss Shipstone married Alromisse after they met in Skelmersdale, her home town in Lancashire. Having been a practising Catholic, she converted to Islam and quickly became devout. ‘She started wearing long robes and only eating halal food,’ a family friend said. ‘Her son Stephen began using the name Adam.’ The couple had a daughter named Yasmin Miriam in September 2001, but she died eight months later. Mary was born in 2006 but according to former neighbours, social services had to intervene, with orders barring Alromisse from being alone with either child. Fear: A man who lives close to where the incident took place said the village was 'on lockdown' Peaceful village: Cavix Field in Northiam, close to the scene of  yesterday's shooting . ‘He used to hit Stephen,’ the family friend said. ‘Stephen used to say “He’s a bad man”.’ In a tweet posted on December 24, 2009, Miss Shipstone wrote: ‘We loved the snow. Our garden was amazing, covered in thick white snow. We can leave the house without worrying about my husband bothering us.’ Alromisse became a Community Safety Officer for Uttlesford District Council in Essex. His job involved helping with projects to try to reduce crime. Police were last night at an address in Broomfield Avenue, Worthing, West Sussex, where Alromisse was thought to be renting a flat. Detective Chief Inspector Jason Taylor of Sussex Police said: ‘We are trying to establish Mr Alromisse’s movements over the last few days and are keen to hear from anyone who may have seen or heard from him.’ The force said a suspect had been identified and 'is contained', and officers were not looking for anyone else .","Mary Ann Shipstone was shot by father Yasser Alromisse on Thursday .

"An Alabama man awoke from a routine circumcision to find doctors had mistakenly amputated his penis, according to a lawsuit. Johnny Lee Banks Jr., 56, and his wife, Zelda Banks, 55, filed the lawsuit against Princeton Baptist Medical Center in Jefferson County Circuit Court in Birmingham on Tuesday. 'My client is devastated,' their attorney, John P. Graves, said. It is not known why Banks underwent the circumcision last month, but the lawsuit says he had been receiving treatment from the Urology Centers of Alabama when he went for the procedure. 'Botched procedure': A patient is suing Princeton Baptist Medical Center, pictured, after he went in for a routine circumcision operation but awoke to find doctors had amputated his penis . In his lawsuit, he says he was never warned that the procedure might result in an amputation, and he never gave his consent for a full or partial amputation. He has now been left in extreme pain and has spent additional time recovering in the hospital - costing him more money, according to the lawsuit, AL.com reported. His wife is also suing for loss of consortium due to the botched operation. The suit names the hospital, Urology Centers of Alabama, the Simon-Williamson Clinic and two doctors as defendants in the case. Banks, who does not work due to a disability, is seeking an unspecified dollar amount in the suit. Attorney John P. Graves . A hospital spokeswoman says the claims lack merit but that they cannot provide further comment due to the ongoing litigation. The other defendants didn't return messages seeking comment. A similar lawsuit was brought in Kentucky in 2011 after a man's penis was partially amputated when a doctor found potentially deadly cancer while performing a circumcision surgery. But a jury concluded that the doctor exercised proper care in performing the amputation without consulting the patient.","Johnny Lee Banks, Jr., from Birmingham, Alabama, went for the routine procedure last month but awoke to find his penis was gone .

The colorful comment comes as little surprise given Begala's close connection to another lively commentator, James 'The Raging Cajun' Carville. While 69 million people watched the vice presidential debate in 2008, far fewer than that are thought to have been watching CNN when the comment was made due to the network's decreased viewership. CNN has had a well-noted tumble in the ratings in recent months, as The Huffington Post reports that the network's primetime viewership is down 41 per cent in August as compared to the same month the previous year.",Comment made by former Clinton strategist Paul Begala on CNN minutes before vice presidential debate .
"ESPN host Stephen A. Smith has says that his comment to women that 'you can do your part' not to incite domestic violence from men was the 'most egregious error' of his career during a prerecorded apology aired on First Take today. ESPN issued a statement shortly after Smith's apology saying that it demonstrates that 'he recognizes his mistakes and has a deeper appreciation of our company values.' Smith explains that when discussing Ray Rice's two-game suspension last Friday for knocking his fiancee unconscious, 'my words came across that it was somehow a woman's fault.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Tape talk: Stephen A. Smith apologized to ESPN viewers for insinuating that women 'provoke' domestic abuse from men . 'This was not my intent. It is not what I was trying to say,' he adds. Cohost . Cari Champion added that 'provoke' can be a trigger word for abuse victims. The ESPN2 program then quickly cut to a live on-air roundtable about LeBron James and there was . no further discussion about Smith's comments. Smith made the 'provoke' comments during a discussion of the NFL being too lenient . on Rice, the Baltimore Ravens player who was captured on camera . knocking out his . then-fiancee (now wife) at an Atlantic City casino and . dragging her limp body from the elevator. Smith stated that no man . should ever hit a woman, but added that women, for their part, can take responsibility for avoiding that abuse. 'Let's make sure we don’t do anything to provoke wrong actions,' he said. Smith has spoken about abuse before when . Bengals player Chad Johnson was arrested for domestic battery, saying . that Johnson 'put himself in this situation' because of 'who he . married.' The . harshest criticism of Smith came from within the ESPN organization, . with SportsNation cohost Michelle Beadle expressing her disgust last . Friday.

In another tweet, Beadle said, 'I'm thinking about wearing a miniskirt this weekend...I'd hate to think what I'd be asking for by doing so @stephenasmith. #dontprovoke.' She went on: 'Violence isn't the victim's issue. It's the abuser's. To insinuate otherwise is irresponsible and disgusting. Walk. Away.' Smith reacted to criticism with a long Twitter rant that has since been deleted. Lenient punishment: Ray Rice was caught on camera knocking his then-fiancee out cold and dragging her body from a casino elevator and was given a two-game suspension . 'Enough is enough,' he wrote. 'I simply asked: now what about the other side … what about addressing women on how they can help prevent the obvious wrong being done upon them?' In subsequent tweets, he essentially reiterated the comments he made on-air. The recent taped segment echoes a statement that was issued on Friday after Smith's tweets, in which he said that he does 'not believe a woman provokes the horrible domestic abuses that are sadly such a major problem in our society.' He also apologized if his comments were taken to convey anything other than his condemnation of violence against women.","Stephen A.

"As the U.S. and Russia jostled for supremacy during the cold war, both sides spent a great deal of time and money investigating how animals could be used as spies. Many of the ideas sound bizarre, but at the IQ Zoo in Hot Springs, Arkansas, experts had a government contract to train animals specifically for defense and intelligence work. Not all of their attempts were successful, some never got past the drawing board, but others were used during the cold war era for spying purposes included training ravens to deposit and . retrieve objects, conditioning pigeons to warn of enemy ambushes and . even teaching cats to eavesdrop on human conversations. Bob Bailey and his team at the IQ Zoo in Arkansas had government funding in the 60s and 70s to develop animals such as ravens for spying purposes . Project Acoustic Kitty: Using cochlear implants, Bailey's team attempted to use cats as transmitters with a wire running from the cat¿s inner ear to a battery and instrument cluster implanted in its rib cage . ‘We never found an animal we could not train,’ Bob Bailey, who worked on the program, told Smithsonian. Now 76, he was the first Director of Training in the Navy's Marine Mammal Program, before he joined IQ Zoo and  becoming general manager of Animal Behavior Enterprises (ABE), the company who owned the zoo. Although animals had been used for military intelligence purposes since ancient Greek times, it was during the 1960s that the work came especially into vogue. As well as a tourist destination where parents could take their children to watch chickens play baseball and macaws ride bicycles, the IQ Zoo started to receive funding from governments agencies - including the CIA - to use animals for other purposes. IQ Zoo was founded by Marian and Keller Breland, who were advocates of operant conditioning to train animals such as this 'muscular goat' which could trip a sledgehammer to ring a bell . ‘They came to us to solve problems,’ said Bailey. ‘It was the height of the cold war.’ The zoo was opened by Keller Breland and his wife Marian, who had been students of the psychologist B.F. Skinner, who had devised the concept of operant conditioning and teaching animals to carry out complex processes. During World War II, Skinner had received defense funding to research a pigeon-based homing device for missiles, although it was never deployed. Prior to joining IQ Zoo, Bailey had been the first director of training for the Navy’s pioneering dolphin program, which developed methods of training them to perform tasks including detecting and clearing mines to retrieving tools. A partially declassified 1976 CIA document on naval dolphin training notes, the Soviets were ‘also assessing and replicating U.S. systems while possibly developing countermeasures to certain U.S. systems.’ Soon after joining ABE, Bailey got involved in the ‘acoustic kitty’ project, after the CIA’s Directorate of Science and Technology had proposed using cats as listening devices. Both the Russians and Americans tried to dolphins to perform tasks including detecting and clearing mines and retrieving tools . According to Bailey, the theory was that no one would pay attention to the animals’ comings and goings. ‘We found that we could condition the cat to listen to voices,’ said Bailey. ‘We have no idea how we did it. But...we found that the cat would more and more listen to people’s voices, and listen less to other things.’ Using cochlear implants, his team attempted to use cats as transmitters with a wire running from the cat’s inner ear to a battery and instrument cluster implanted in its rib cage. The cat’s movements could be directed - left, right, straight ahead - with ultrasonic sound. The fate of the ‘acoustic kitty’ isn't clear as there were conflicting accounts about the project. Ex-CIA official Victor Marchetti claimed in the book ‘The Wizards of Langley’ that the cat was run over by a taxi before his skills could be utilized. Keller Breland, training a dolphin for the Navy, started IQ Zoo with his wife after working with acclaimed psychologist B.F. Skinner . Ravens were another creature that Bailey and the team found could be used for spying purposes. He recalled building a ‘movie set’ of the area around the Watergate Hotel in Washington, D.C. and then conditioning a raven, via a laser spotter, to pick out a particular room. Bailey claims that both ravens and cats were successfully used to spy, but the program suffered a cut in funding following in 1975 after the Senate Select Committee to Study Government Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities was formed to investigate abuses of power at several U.S. intelligence agencies, including the CIA. In more recent years, the work carried out by Bailey and team at IQ Zoo has been overtaken by technology. 'Today, all you have to do is illuminate someone with an infrared laser and pick up the scatter back from that, and you can listen to their conversation without any trouble at all,' he said. 'You don’t need a cat.' In the 1960s, the IQ Zoo was a tourist attraction for children who came to see the likes of 'The Bunny Photographer' (above), while behind the scenes experts worked on animals for other purposes for the CIA .","Experts were being paid by the government during the 60s and 70s to investigate how animals could be used as spies .

"Rescuing four people from a car crash might seem like a pretty heroic act, but Josh Romney, son of former presidential candidate Mitt, has received a large amount of flak since tweeting about his apparent heroics on Thanksgiving night. Josh Romney, 38, posted a message to nearly 20,000 followers on Friday morning, complete with a goofy photo of him grinning in front of an overturned SUV and destroyed home in Salt Lake City. The real estate developer has since received a large amount of online mockery after writing: 'Was first on scene to big accident, see pic of car in the house. I lifted 4 people out to safety. All ok. Thankful.' Goofy: Romney was mocked after posting this photo of him grinning in front of a wrecked car and ruined house and accused of attempting a 'humblebrag' Romney has upset the Twitter-verse by breaking one of the cardinal sins of the medium and using the situation to post a ‘humblebrag,’ a tweet which attempts to boast about something while at the same time trying to mask it as something altogether more self-effacing. 'Who tweets a pictures of themselves at the science of a car accident!?! Desperate for attention, much?', tweeted one critic, while another asked: 'Why are you smiling like a tourist at such a horrific scene?' Two other commenters added 'Who but a member of the Romney family would pose for pictures, smiling, to brag about something like this?' and 'I can't figure out what's worse...the mangled car & destroyed home, or that smile at a car crash. Public safety is hilarious.' For many it was Romney's use of the word ‘I’ in his tweet that made it such an obvious attempt at a ‘humblebrag.’ Humble? Josh Romney rescued four victims of a car crash on Thanksgiving night, and then tweeted about it . Brood: Josh (left) and his family support Mitt Romney during a rally in Nevada in February 2012 . The phrase ‘humblebrag’, stems from the words humble and bragging and was first coined by American comedian Harris Wittels in 2011. He subsequently set up the Twitter account @Humblebrag; to retweet what he considers the worst-offending 'humblebrags' mainly from celebrities. A ‘humblebrag,’ is considered by many Twitter users to be an even worse offense than overt bragging, because the user is attempting to have it both ways – to tell everyone about something amazing that they’re doing, while also attempting to appear self-effacing and unpretentious. The 'humblebrag' is not limited to celebrities and has become an all-too-familiar phenomenon that most people will have noticed friends and family posting on their Facebook feed or on Twitter. Here are some examples of terrible 'humblebrags': . Romney, who has been mentioned as a . possible future political candidate in Utah, also posted the photo on . Facebook where he received more than a hundred comments, many positive . ones calling him a hero, but some saying things like ‘what a . self-serving ghoul…’ and ‘no [sic] another Romney fabrication.’ Romeny’s exact role in the rescue has also been called into question by someone else who was at the scene. Rick Gregor, a neighbor who heard the . wreck and called 911, told KSL he didn't notice Romney because there . were a lot of people on scene when the crash happened, and they were . more focused on the people in the car than those helping them get out. Romney's twitter account has been all quiet since he posted about the crash on Friday. The Salt Lake Tribune . reported that the vehicle left Interstate 215 on 4500 South and went . straight through an intersection before smashing into the home, where no . one was hurt. Unified Police Lieutenant Justin Hoyal said that the accident had left the house 'unlivable.' In a statement on Friday, Romney . explained he was driving home with wife Jen and their three children . after the family Thanksgiving dinner when he stopped at the . intersection. Familiar pose: Josh gestures during his father's failed presidential campaign last year . 'Just then, a vehicle traveling at . highway speed passed narrowly by my car, through the intersection and . into the kitchen of a home across the street,' he said. 'I drove to the accident site and . entered the home where the car had come to a stop on its side. I opened . the car door and spoke with the four passengers inside the car. 'Miraculously, they appeared to have . no major injuries. I was able to help each of them get out of the car . and lift them down to the ground,' Romney added. The second son of last year's . presidential candidate said that he was grateful that no one was . seriously injured, glad to have been able to help and he did what anyone . else would have done in the same situation. Police are still looking into the . cause of the accident, but believe it may have been caused by the driver . suffering a seizure while at the wheel.","Josh Romney is facing growing criticism over his decision to tweet about helping to pull four people from a car crash on Thursday night .

"The full horror of the crash of the Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo rocket emerged last night as witnesses described seeing the stricken pilot who died hurtling to earth in his ejector seat. The accident over the Mojave desert in California – which was still unexplained last night – killed American pilot Michael Alsbury and injured his co-pilot, fellow American Peter Siebold, 43, who managed to parachute from an altitude of nearly 50,000ft and amazingly survived. But Sir Richard Branson yesterday angrily dismissed critics who said the accident was predictable due to his commercial rocket ship’s ‘crude’ design, insisting that it would be ‘irresponsible’ to comment before a full investigation. And, astonishingly, he revealed that someone had signed up for a flight after the tragedy. Scroll down for video . At a press conference, Branson said he hoped the crash would not scare away the 700 who have already paid for a seat. ‘We have had numerous messages of support from the people – the astronauts – who have signed up for this,’ he said. ‘We even had someone sign up yesterday in support of the programme. ‘Anybody who ever wants a refund will be able to get a refund.’ The billionaire vowed to persevere with his ambition to take tourists into space, insisting he would lead the way. He told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I want to be on the first flight – I will be on the first flight.’ Two men working in the desert witnessed the explosion on Friday. One, Tom Guevara, 61, described seeing Alsbury hit the ground ‘still strapped into his ejector seat and bounce back up about 150ft in the air before coming to rest’. He said it was ‘the most awful thing I’ve ever seen’, adding: ‘It’s not something you’d want anyone thinking of flying into space to see.’ His colleague, Mick Smith, 33, added: ‘The pilot’s body hit the ground first, coming down fast without a parachute. Perhaps the chute got burned up in the explosion, or didn’t open.’ Virgin Atlantic has long been accused of ignoring warnings that its £312million rocket was unsafe. Pilot Michael Alsbury (left) was killed in the crash near Mojave, California, while co-pilot Peter Siebold (right) survived . Grisly scene: Law enforcement officials examine the wreckage of the Virgin Galactic  SpaceShipTwo . Mangled: The undercarriage of the aircraft can be seen amid the twisted metal of the fuselage in the Mojave Desert . Sir Richard Branson angrily dismissed critics who said the rocket ship's accident was predictable, vowing that he and his son would be on the first commercial space flight . Carolynne Campbell, an expert on rocket propulsion, told a newspaper last night: ‘This explosion is not a surprise. It is exactly what I was expecting. It was Russian roulette which test flight blew up.’ Warnings were issued as long ago as 2007 after a previous explosion that killed three workers. Geoff Daly, a US-based British rocket scientist, warned US officials last year of another disaster if test flights were given the go-ahead. At the time, Virgin Galactic had planned to begin its first passenger flights in December 2013. Sir Richard Branson’s space tourism project has been plagued with problems and delays from the outset. He launched Virgin Galactic ten years ago, promising to take his first passengers into space three years later. But he encountered problems in upgrading his first spacecraft and there were claims that his ‘engineers were working in the unknown’. The first Virgin Galactic disaster hit the project in July 2007 when an early version of the nitrous oxide liquid fuel tank exploded, killing three workers. It has also emerged that one of Virgin’s star pilots, who left the company for a competitor, had characterised the solid rocket fuel used until recently as being unstable during tests. And, in his recent biography of the entrepreneur, the writer Tom Bower has questioned Sir Richard’s abilities to compete in the space tourism race. He said that Branson ‘did not appreciate the consequence of his innocence as he embarked on his final attempt to become a major player in America’. Last night, colleagues described Alsbury, who was married, as highly respected and experienced. He had worked for Scaled Composites, Virgin’s partner company in the programme, for 13 years and was a project engineer as well as a test pilot. Siebold is a design engineer for the firm. Alsbury’s widow Michelle last night said: ‘I have lost the love of my life. I am living in hell right now.’ Siebold’s father, Dr Klaus Siebold, said last night: ‘It’s a miracle that my son is still alive. I talked to him recently about the new fuel mixture they were testing, and he was confident that it was going to be a great advantage. He had no concerns.’ Despite Sir Richard’s determination to carry on with his project, the tragedy has cast doubt on the future of space tourism, with some suggesting his dream might be over. But the billionaire entrepreneur said: ‘Once we find out what went wrong, once the test pilots have done all the test flights needed, and once we get the licence, myself and my son will certainly accompany the first commercial flight.’ His son Sam was with him during the visit to Mojave Airport, where Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo took off on Friday morning. Before they met crash investigators, Sam was asked if he still felt comfortable joining the inaugural flight, if it ever gets off the ground. ‘I’ll leave it to my father to do the talking,’ he said. While praising his pioneering spirit, critics have accused Branson of overstretching himself with his latest venture, which he describes as his ‘boldest yet’. Yesterday his unofficial biographer, Tom Bower, said that the crash was ‘predictable’ because Virgin was using a ‘crude rocket’, with an experimental fuel. Mr Bower said: ‘All the engineers in California working on the project I’ve spoken to said it was very dangerous. Just a few weeks ago the last of many of the Virgin Galactic engineers walked out of the factory and said he’d never work there again.’ But Sir Richard hit back, saying: ‘I find it slightly irresponsible that people who know nothing are saying things before the National Transportation Safety Board make their comments. We are determined to find out what went wrong... This is the biggest test programme ever carried out in commercial aviation history, precisely to ensure that this never happens to the public. ‘In testing the boundaries of human capabilities and technologies we are standing on the shoulders of giants. Yesterday we fell short.’ It could be months before the cause of the disaster is known. Yesterday debris littered the scrubland chaparral dotted with dunes and Joshua trees near Cantil.Residents were evacuated from homes near to where the spaceship’s fuel tank fell, amid fears of further explosions and toxic poisoning. After the blast, Mr Smith said he saw the spaceship ‘coming down, spiralling and trailing gas, as if it was leaking fuel. It didn’t look as though it was on fire. There was no explosion when it hit the ground. It just shattered apart’. His colleague added: ‘The pilot’s ejector seat left a huge crater beside the road. We raced over to see if there was anything we could do. But the pilot was beyond help.’ The shattered tail section of SpaceShipTwo lay in pieces nearby, the word ‘Virgin’ visible on the torn metal. Initial suspicions for the tragedy focused on a new mix of fuel being tested for the first time in flight. The accident occurred as SpaceShipTwo fired up its rockets. Voyagers: Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are among celebrities with tickets . It remains to be seen how many of the celebrities who paid £156,000 to blast into space with Branson will take up his offer of a refund. More than 700 wealthy passengers – among them Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie and Justin Bieber – have booked seats on the first flights, which had been expected to begin next year. While some are said to remain committed, many are expected to pull out quietly. However, ticket-holder Jon Goodwin, 68, a retired British businessman and former Olympic canoeist, said the crash had not deterred him. He said: ‘I am confident this will go ahead. Of course it came to me as a shock, it stopped me in my tracks – I could have been one of those people who was killed. But I am utterly confident the people in the Mojave desert will rectify the problem and I will fly and I am totally confident it will be totally safe before I do so.’ Other stars set to fly are Ashton Kutcher, Lady Gaga, Tom Hanks, Princess Beatrice and Katy Perry. So is it just a waste of time? The first space tourists will experience just five minutes of weightlessness on their flight, at the boundary of the Earth’s atmosphere and outer space. One critic likened it to a ‘high-altitude bungee jump’, while astronaut Chris Hadfield, who flew two Shuttle missions, questioned whether the trip was worth the ticket price, saying: ‘It’s not much of a space flight.’","Witnesses described seeing stricken pilot Michael Alsbury hurtling to earth in his ejector seat after the explosion .

"The brother of murdered British aid worker Alan Henning has called on David Cameron to send troops to hunt down the Islamic State (IS) militants responsible for his death. Reg Henning said the brutal Islamist group were 'monsters' and ground forces were needed to find them. In a BBC interview he said that the Henning family had been in a 'living nightmare' and condemned the Government for preventing them from speaking out about his brother's capture. Alan Henning poses for a friend as they wait to cross the Turkish border. Not long after the photo was taken, he was kidnapped by IS terrorists. He believed that he would be freed but last week the Islamic State posted a video of his beheading . A video showing the murder of the 47-year-old former taxi driver from Salford - who was kidnapped on Boxing Day last year at Al-Dana, Syria by IS militants – was posted on the internet by the group. Reg Henning claimed that it might have made a difference if the family had been allowed to speak out earlier about his capture, rather than only being able to break their silence when he first appeared in an IS video last month. He told the BBC: 'It's been a living nightmare. We've had to keep it quiet for nine months, we've been gagged by the Government and the Foreign Office not to say a thing. For the last three weeks I've hardly slept, I've felt sick, physically sick. Kindly: Alan Henning cuddles a child after travelling thousands of miles to deliver aid to Syria . 'We were told not to discuss it, virtually we were gagged for nine months, couldn't say a thing to anybody. It was just done on a need to know basis which, basically, was immediate family.' Asked how that made him feel he said: 'I think it's disgusting because, if we had been able to talk, and voice our opinions, I think the Government may have stood up and listened more.' He added: 'We've seen the campaign that Alan's generated now, all the ribbons round Eccles and everything. If this was done six months ago it could have done more good.'

Alan  Henning is shown being filmed by the BBC last year helping to prepare a convoy of humanitarian supplies for Syrian refugees . March 2013: Alan Henning took unpaid leave from his job as a cabbie to deliver relief supplies to Syrians . 'You're not going to find them by dropping a few bombs in Iraq,' he said. 'We need send ground forces in to find out where these monsters are - the sooner we do it the sooner the killing stops.' But he backed the Government's policy of not paying ransoms to secure the release of hostages held by IS. He said that 'by giving them more money you are giving them the opportunity to purchase more arms and weapons and that would just increase the problem because they would be in the position to snatch more hostages'. Mr Henning, who described his brother's killers as 'barbaric', said he hoped that Mr Cameron 'stands by his word' to hunt down those responsible. In a message to the Prime Minister, Mr Henning said he wanted those responsible for his brother's death to be brought back to the UK to stand trial. A candlelit vigil held in Eccles Park near Alan Henning's home in Eccles, Manchester . He said: 'Go and find them, bring them to justice, bring them over here, let us try them.'

"Hull City boss Steve Bruce has expressed his surprise at being able to land Newcastle midfielder Hatem Ben Arfa on loan until the end of the season.

His departure has caused some consternation on Tyneside with former Magpie Olivier Bernard describing the club's decision as 'a big gamble'. VIDEO Scroll down to see Ben Arfa's cringworthy tribute to Tupac Shakur . New face: Hull City have signed Hatem Ben Arfa on loan from Newcastle for the season . Late night deal: Ben Arfa was pictured on Sky Sports News with Hull manager Steve Bruce late on Monday . Bruce had been watching Ben Arfa since he fell out of favour at St James' Park but with plenty of other interest he was not convinced a short-term deal would be possible. Bruce told his club's official website: 'I've been monitoring Ben Arfa for a couple of weeks and we quietly made it happen. 'I didn't think it would be possible to do a loan deal, but the later it got the more beneficial it became. With a bit of patience and luck, we've managed to pull in a really good player. 'We all know he is a wonderful talent and although it has gone a little bit sideways for him at Newcastle in the last couple of months, he'll bring that little bit of flair and creativity that every team needs.' Out of favour: Ben Arfa had been exiled to the reserves by Alan Pardew at Newcastle . Dismay: Newcastle supporters unfurled a banner of Ben Arfa during the draw against Crystal Palace . Despite a promising start to his Newcastle career Ben Arfa fell out of favour with boss Alan Pardew and was left out of the club's long-haul pre-season tour. Inconsistency and a perceived lack of effort saw him banished to the reserves but some Newcastle supporters are clearly unhappy over the Frenchman's departure. His compatriot Bernard told the Newcastle Chronicle: 'It's a big gamble. It's also a big statement from Alan Pardew that he does not believe in Hatem. 'The only problem is, it seems he is the only one who doesn't believe in him. The big issue is that Newcastle won't look very good if he starts to perform the way Hatem can in a Hull City shirt.'

And the Tigers boss paid tribute to those at that club who helped facilitate what he described as a day of 'fantastic business'. Bruce added: 'When we were having discussions about the sale of Shane Long a few weeks ago, they said it wasn't a problem to reinvest the money we received. 'They've proved that again with what we've been able to do in this transfer window.

In the note Nancy begins by saying that ‘if anything happens to me’ then John gets ‘whatever he wants of my possessions’ including their dog Lucy. She writes: ‘My mother and so-called ‘siblings’ get nothing except the memory that they are the ones that drove me into the deepest depression I’ve ever been in. Class act: At a memorial for Nancy last May, Julia looked grief-stricken. But Nancy claimed in tweets before she died that Julia treated her badly. In one she said: 'Just so you all know, America¿s Sweetheart is a b*****' Bequest: Nancy note said she wanted her jewelry and clothese to go to her closest friends - not her sister and mother . ‘I have suffered thru this disease all my life, however It has never been this bad. ‘I burst into tears every morning b/c (because) I woke up.’ The note was filed court papers in relation to probate of Nancy’s estate. It has three sections; one addressed to John, another to her mother Betty and Roberts, and a third addressed to ‘everyone’. However under California law the Los Angeles County Coroner is only obliged to give the pages to the person to whom they are addressed. Family gathering: Julia greeted well-wishers at a grave site service for Nancy Motes at a service in Smyrna, Georgia in May . Betty and Roberts, 46, have not added their letters to the court file, so they remain private. In the section of the note addressed to John, which is in the file, Nancy praises him as her ‘one true love’ and tells him she is unworthy of his affections. She begs his forgiveness and says she is ‘nothing but a junky’ - who will be ‘better off w/out (without) me’. Nancy writes: ‘I know this will effect you the most and & I can’t apologize enough. ‘I was truly blessed & lucky to have you as my true love and best friend. I will carry you with me forever.’ Her final words are: ‘And I am so sorry’. Love of her life: Nancy left her fiance John Dilbeck her most prized possessions, including her dog Lucky . Battle: Although Nancy declared her wishes in this note,  Dilbeck and his family are now engaged in a bitter legal battle with Pretty Woman star  and her mother Betty for control of her estate . The suicide note reflects the ill feeling that Nancy had towards Roberts which she expressed in a number of Tweets before she died. In one she said: ‘Just so you all know, America’s Sweetheart is a b*****’ Another read: ‘Do you want to be a fan of someone so cruel? She’s not even that good of an actress. Happy you totally f***** me’. A third angry Tweet read: ‘(M)y own family has abandoned me’. Motes, originally from Georgia, was the daughter of Roberts’ mother, Betty, 79, and her former stepfather, Michael Motes, 69. Downhill: Julia puts a protective arm around Nancy in this 2002 photo but the sisters had a parting of the ways . Sad goodbye: Nancy's totured last words are a loving tribute to her fiance . Last month Roberts and Betty both attended the service to bury Nancy in Smyrna, Georgia. Reports of what happened are contradictory, with one magazine reporting that Roberts was ‘very polite and kind’ during the ceremony, which was attended by family and friends. However RadarOnline reported that mourners were stunned by her ‘bizarre eulogy’. Roberts supposedly said: ‘ Nancy’s...Gone and not coming back’, according to a source. The source added: ‘Julia said that, as her sister, she just wanted to ‘wring’ her neck because she didn’t wait to see the joy that comes with the morning.’ Unwelcome: When Nancy told Julia of her intention to visit their mother Betty in the hospital, Julia reportedly told her:  'Please be gone by 3:30' Nancy’s relationship with her mother and Roberts had long been rocky but fell apart last year after she sold a story to a newspaper about how her famous sister used to tease her about her weight. According to RadarOnline, texts apparently sent between Roberts and Nancy in November of  last year relating to their mother’s breast cancer battle underscore just how bad things had become. One from Roberts reads: ‘If you plan on seeing Mom in the next 2 weeks you should go in the next hour. Thanks.’ Nancy replied: ‘We’re heading to see her now. Thanks’. In a cold reply, Roberts wrote: ‘Please be gone by 3:30.’ Last straw: Although she professed her eternal love for Dilbeck, Nancy said she couldn't go on . Just over a week later things became tense when Roberts sent her a message trying to take control of when Nancy would visit. Her message read: ‘We will text you when Mom’s surgery is scheduled’. Nancy replied: ‘Mom asked me to come to the hospital. I’m coming.’ But Roberts insisted: ‘She is asleep. She has to get an x ray and isn’t even admitted to the hospital yet. She is only allowed 1 person with her.’ The texts were from a preview of a documentary called Now That I Have Your Attention, which is about Nancy’s video diaries. It was uploaded to YouTube but has now been taken down.","Julia Roberts' sister Nancy Motes committed suicide on February 9. She was 37 years old .

Such details are contained in the . latest edition of Le Point which, along with other publications . ‘favoured’ by Ms Trierweiler, has led coverage of the growing scandal in . France. ‘She took a pill too many,’ one source tells the Paris magazine. ‘However, she never wanted to attempt suicide.’ The . source goes on to describe Mr Hollande as being ‘cold and ruthless’ when he confessed to his affair with Julie Gayet, the 41 year old Paris . actress. Plus one? French President Francois Hollande, right, offers a rose to his partner Valerie Trierweiler in 2012. Allegations have arisen that he has a long-standing affair with an actress . Le Nouvel . Observateur, which has outstanding Elysee Palace contacts, said Mr . Hollande wanted to split up with Ms Trierweiler, but her sudden . hospitalisation meant she could not. ‘François Hollande had a dream but it only lasted the weekend,’ said the left wing weekly. Mr . Hollande had hoped, the magazine claimed, to get his official partner . to sign a joint announcement of their separation on Saturday. With a crucial conference before the world’s press scheduled for Tuesday he thought this would be the ‘least worst solution’. But by Sunday night, Mr Hollande abandoned the plan, because he feared it would make him look cruel and insensitive. Now .

Mr Hollande's insistence that the scandal is a 'private matter' which . should be kept 'secret', Ms Gayet is the cover girl in the latest . edition of French Elle. In it she is quoted as telling a friend 'more . than a year ago' that she has found an 'older man, very different from . earlier boyfriends, who is in politics.' This raises the prospect . that Mr Hollande started the affair within a few months of being sworn . in as French president in May 2012. It was around this time that . Ms Trierweiler, a journalist for Paris Match magazine, began to restyle . herself as France's first lady.

"The final list for the St Louis Rams ten-player practice squad has been announced - and does not feature Michael Sam. The defensive end, who was the first openly gay player drafted in the NFL, was among the last to be dropped on Saturday as the Missouri team announced its final pick for the 2014 season. On Tuesday, the Rams signed ten players to their practice squad and  Sam was not among them. Scroll down for video . St Louis Rams defensive end Michael Sam pictured in July. He has been completely cut from the team following today's announcement of the Rams' practice squad which did not include him . So far no other team has taken the opportunity to pick him up. The Rams added two each at linebacker, offensive line, wide receiver and safety on Monday, fortifying needy positions. Sam starred at defensive line for Missouri but coach Jeff Fisher said the defensive line was the strongest group on the team. Rookie quarterback Garrett Gilbert and seven others were among the cuts that got the roster to 53 players. The final announcement on the practice squad came as no surprise amid reports this weekend that Sam would be dropped. While getting cut by the Rams means Sam's dreams of becoming the first gay NFL player have now been placed on hold, he was undeterred. He posted an upbeat message  to his Twitter account on Saturday despite his obstacles. 'The most worthwhile things in life rarely come easy, this is a lesson I've always known. The journey continues,' he wrote. His boyfriend, Vito Cammisano, also showed his support for Sam by tweeted a picture of the couple together, wearing shirts from the University of Missouri, where they both attended college. Sam, who came out in the months leading up to the draft, celebrated with his boyfriend Vito Cammisano on live television after he was picked for the St Louis Rams . Sam showed up for his face-to-face exit meeting with  Rams coach Jeff Fisher on Sunday. He shook hands with two reporters and accepted well wishes but declined further comment before heading upstairs to see the coach. The Rams selected Sam, the SEC co-defensive player of the year at Missouri, with the 249th overall pick out of 256 overall during May's draft. Sam came out following his final season at Missouri. Rams coach Jeff Fisher  made clear from the start that he chose Sam because he thought he had the talent to make it in the NFL. After he was drafted by the Rams, Sam kissed his boyfriend on live TV and arrived brimming with confidence at training camp - and with a quick retort for anyone who contended he was in the NFL only because he came out. Michael Sam posted this message on Twitter on Saturday after he was dropped by the St Louis Rams roster for the 2014 season . The cameras followed but the extra attention did not seem to faze Sam or his teammates. However a Buffalo Bills linebacker claimed this weekend that Sam's sexual orientation was the reason that he was no longer attached to an NFL team. Offensive lineman Eric Wood  blamed the media for focusing on the player's personal life. Wood's comment came after sports commentator Ross Tucker publicly wondered on Twitter why 'Michael Sam performed much better than most expected and still isn't even on a practice squad?' ''Blame that on espn,' Wood tweeted in response to Sam's inability to find an NFL home. 'No one wants the distraction.'' Sam had picked up the Arthur Ashe Courage award last month where he told the audience: 'Great things can happen when you have the courage to be yourself.' Michael Sam had garnered a lot of media attention (pictured on July 29 at a Rams training camp) after he became the first openly gay player to be drafted .","The defensive end was the first openly gay player drafted in the NFL .

"The Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund filed a lawsuit on behalf of gender non-conforming teen Chase Culpepper, 16, accusing the South Carolina DMV of violating the 16-year-old's rights by refusing to let him wear makeup for a driver's license photo . A 16-year-old South Carolinian is suing the state's Department of Motor Vehicles for not allowing him to wear makeup for a driver's license photo. Chase Culpepper, who was born male, regularly wears eye shadow and eyeliner, and either androgynous or women's clothing. The teen does not identify with gender-specific pronouns. Culpepper told reporters Tuesday that being ordered by officials to remove what they called a ‘disguise’ was humiliating. The lawsuit filed on Culpepper’s behalf by the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund in federal court today said the DMV violated the teen's rights. Back in March, the state agency refused to let Culpepper wear makeup for the photo because of a policy that bans license pictures when someone is purposefully altering his or her appearance. The 16-year-old, who had passed his driving test, was forced to wipe his face clean to get his license. The TLDEF stated in a press release that the DMV’s rule is unconstitutional because it is vague and arbitrary. The lawsuit was brought by Chase’s mother, Teresa Culpepper, asking the court to rule that denying Chase the freedom to wear his everyday makeup in his license photo constitutes sex discrimination and violates his right to free speech and expression under the US Constitution. ‘As a mother, it broke my heart to see Chase being forced to be someone that he isn’t. Every time he pulls out his license, he is reminded of that, and that makes it even worse,’ said Teresa Culpepper. ‘I love my son just the way he is. The DMV should not have treated him this way.’ Scroll down for video . Before and after: Chase Culpepper wore make up, left, to have his photograph taken, but was asked to remove it, right, before the DMV would take his license photo . As for Chase, the 16-year-old is hoping for a do-over. ‘I . want to take my license photo again, with makeup, so I can be myself . and express to the world who I truly am,’ the teen said. In . June, the DMV rejected demands from Chase and the transgender advocacy . group to be allowed to wear makeup for a driver's license photo. Chase said at the time that DMV staff claimed agency rules dictated that the photo needed to show the . person as they appear normally, and banned pictures taken in 'disguise'. 'This is who I am and my clothing and make-up reflect that,' Chase said. 'The Department of Motor Vehicles should . not have forced me to remove my make-up simply because my appearance . does not meet their expectations of what a boy should look like.' However, a request to the DMV from the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund, which asked if the teenager could have his photo retaken, has been turned down. Michel Silverman, executive director of the organization, said: 'Chase's freedom to express his gender should not be restricted by DMV staff. 'He is entitled to be who he is and express that without interference from government actors.' Upset: Chase wanted to have the license picture, above, retaken after he was forced to remove his make up . Denied: A request to let Chase, a gender non-conforming teenager, get a new picture has been turned down . But Beth Parks, a spokeswoman for the agency, said that the DMV will be sticking to its rules. Ms Parks said that since August 2009, the policy for driver's license photos had been that 'at no time will an applicant be . photographed when it appears that he or she is purposely altering his or . her appearance so that it the photo would misrepresent his or her . identity'. She added that law enforcement agencies relied on the photos to identify people and said Chase's requests for a new picture would be denied. 'If it's Thomas Jones on the license and . yet it looks like a female, that is very confusing for them. They want to know what the identity is,' she said. Big day: Chase had been excited about applying for a driver's license, but left the DMV offices upset . Complaint: The Transgender Legal Defense wrote to the DMV after staff allegedly told Chase that wearing make up was a 'disguise' Chase's mother told WYFF4: her son had been upset by his experiences at the DMV. 'They said he was wearing a disguise. It was very hurtful. He was absolutely devastated. That’s who he is 24/7,' she said. Mrs Culpepper said the DMV policy had ruined what should have been an exciting day for the teenager. 'Instead, . he was singled out and discriminated against because he did not meet . the DMV’s expectations of how a boy should look,' she told Pink News. 'I want my son to be able to be himself without discrimination or harassment. I love him that way and the government should not be telling him that he’s not OK the way he is.'","Chase Culpepper was forced in March to remove makeup for photograph .

"There are numerous fascinating experiments taking place on the International Space Station (ISS) at any time, including efforts to monitor how plants grow in space. But a tree that was grown from a cherry pit that travelled into space five years ago and is now back in solid ground is baffling scientists after it bloomed far earlier than its terrestrial counterparts. The tree made the trip 229 mile (370km) above the Earth around five years ago with astronaut Koichi Wakata, who is now commander of the ISS. The pit sent to space was one of around 265 produced from the fruit of a famous 1,250-year-old Chujohimeseigan-zakura cherry tree (pictured), which grows in the Ganjoji temple, in Higashiomi, which lies to the east of Kyoto, Japan . Scientists were astonished when it bloomed much earlier than normal cherry trees, which typically don’t produce blossom for a decade. The pit was one of around 265 produced from the fruit of a famous 1,250-year-old Chujohimeseigan-zakura cherry tree, which grows in the Ganjoji temple, in Higashiomi, which lies to the east of Kyoto. The tree which produced the pits - that were blasted into space in 2008 and returned a year later - is said to originate from the seventh century. The tree made the trip 229 mile (370km) above the Earth around five years ago with astronaut Koichi Wakata, who is now commander of the ISS. Pictured here Commander Wakata is attempting to understand the mechanisms of how plants build their shape while resisting gravity . At nearly £14,000 ($23,000) to send a kilogram of food into space, cosmic cuisine doesn’t come cheap. But Nasa hopes that in the future it can grow vast quantities of its own food in space. As well as cutting costs, Nasa is hoping a 'space farm' will  deliver a lasting supply of food for astronauts on deep space missions. It could also provide something called ‘horticultural therapy’ for astronauts to reduce stress, alleviate depression and improve their overall general health. The work is part of the Vegetable Production System (Veggie) to grow six romaine lettuce plants under pink LED lamps. Nasa claims that after extensive testing on plants on Earth, it doesn’t expect zero-gravity conditions to affect the growth of the plants. The Chujohimeseigan-zakura tree is a type of the wild cherry species which is notoriously difficult to grow. The Asahi Shimbun reported that until now the ‘space cherry’ attempts to grow young trees from the pits have been unsuccessful. But by covering soil with sphagnum moss, 78-year-old botanist Takao Yoshimura managed to get one of the pits from the ISS to sprout. And remarkably in four years, the young plants was already 13ft (four metres) high. It produced 10 buds, which bloomed last week, some four years before expected. Mr Yoshimura said that it usually takes at least a decade for young cherry trees to flower and that other trees that have grown from the pits from the ISS have also bloomed, perhaps suggesting that their extraordinary journey has somehow accelerated their growth. All the pits were planted in Kochi and Yamanashi in the hope that they might flower one day. The cherry pit came from the Ganjoji temple, in Higashiomi, Japan. The tree which produced the pits - that were blasted into space in 2008 and returned a year later - is said to originate from the seventh century . Botanist Kaori Tomita, of the University of Tsukuba, who was involved in the space experiment does not know why the space cherries are thriving. ‘There is a theoretical possibility that the cosmic environment has had a certain impact on agents in the seeds that control budding and the growth process, but we have absolutely no answer as to why the trees have come into bloom so fast,’ she said. Intriguingly, while each flower of the parent tree has around 30 petals, the ‘space cherry’ blooms only have five petals. ‘As it is grown from a seed, the young plant might have reverted back to have the characteristics of original yamazakura species,’ Dr Yoshimura said, before hypothesising that the number of petals on each flower might increase as the tree matures.

"Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg faced the media at Thursday's press conference ahead of this weekend's Italian Grand Prix. The Mercedes team-mates, and rivals for the Formula One title, were selected by the FIA in the wake of their controversial crash at the Belgium Grand Prix. Rosberg has since been fined a six-figure sum by Mercedes for his role in the incident which resulted in Hamilton retiring from the race. Read what they had to say about the incident in Spa, and on moving forward, below... VIDEO Scroll down to watch Lewis Hamilton preview the Italian Grand Prix . Facing the media: Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg answered questions from the assembled press in Monza . 1.50pm: We're 10 minutes away from today's press conference and the stage is set at Monza. Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg will take their place on the front row, with Ferrari's Fernando Alonso the meat in a Mercedes sandwich. The trio will be joined by Williams driver Valtteri Bottas, McLaren's Kevin Magnussen and Marussia's Max Chilton. 1.55pm: While we wait for the drivers, why not take a look at Nico Rosberg's exclusive MailOnline column. He looks back at the crash in Spa, and concedes it was his error. Click here to read more. 2.00pm: We're up and running in Monza, and the first question goes to Alonso. He says it is Ferrari's 'most important race of the year.' But the Spaniard hopes to be on the podium after signs of being more competitive in Belgium. On the small screen: Hamilton, Fernando Alonso and Rosberg faced the media ahead of the Italian Grand Prix . 2.03pm: Kevin Magnussen talks of his enjoyment of racing in Spa despite a race penalty. 'We're fighting with Force India and for position in the championship,' says the Finn. 2.10pm: Rosberg and Hamilton are asked for their opinions of the Spa crash... Rosberg - 'I took the week to think about it and look at it and discuss with the team. In the end it was me who should take responsibility.' Hamilton adds with a smile: ‘This is the first time there has been so many people in the room. I am excited about moving forward. And I am excited to be here. I hope we can have a good weekend. I already said everything in the press release. Trust is a big word and that is not something I would apply to racing on the track. Me and Nico have been racing a long time and we set a foundation in karting a long time ago and that is what we work from.' Rosberg on making history: 'In Spa I was not proud of the way it went, because in general, I want to contribute to my sport because I want it to be the most entertaining in the world. If I am able to contribute, I am happy about that and in many ways we have, so that is great.' Hamilton adds: 'I don’t have a responsibility to history. History is created every day. I love racing and I am proud to be here. I just enjoy every single day as it comes. I personally don’t put us in the same ranking as the greats back in the day.' Head down: Hamilton signs autographs for fans as he arrives in the paddock on Thursday morning . 2.12pm: The Mercedes pair are then quizzed on whether the team is divided: ‘I don’t feel that is the case,' says Hamilton. 'We have a professional team and they just want to win, so they will be working as hard as they can. They work collectively for the pit stops, so that (division) does not cross my mind. We have the chance for one-two finishes, and they will give it their all.' Rosberg adds: ‘In general there has been a healthy rivalry in the team and that is why we are where we are. We have the best car. If you don’t work well as a team you can’t dominate a sport as we do at the moment, so that is proof (the team is not divided)’. 2.15pm: Hamilton: ‘After the race it was important to move forward. What happened in the past is in the past. There is still a lot of points available so that is my focus.’ Rosberg adds: ‘It was clear from the beginning that we must not have contact as team-mates so that approach does not change.’ Packed house:  The auditorium was rammed for the Thursday afternoon press conference in Monza . Rosberg is asked for his opinion on, according to this journalist, a so-called ‘vicious media attack' and a 'witch hunt'... ‘I respect the opinions. and then for me I try to focus on driving my race car first and working with my team and getting the best out of the situation. I am very lucky to have such a car. It is very seldom in F1 that I can be on pole and win the race at every grand prix. The team is doing an unbelievable job. The other guys are not getting closer and that is great. My focus is on that.' Hamilton is asked if he was punished by the team for ignoring a team instruction at the Hungarian Grand Prix... 'We all get punished for all the incidents,' he replies. 'We have meetings and get a big slap on the wrist. In Hungary I did not say ""No"" to the situation. I said ""if he gets close I would let him by"". Afterwards Toto Wolff and Paddy Lowe said you made the right choice. As human beings we have the right to question orders and that one wasn’t the right one which the team said so in the meeting.' He laughs, before adding: 'Don’t get too emotional about it.' 2.20pm: Hamilton is asked about his future... Eyes on the prize: Rosberg is 29 points ahead of Hamilton in the battle for the Formula One world championship . 'I haven’t said I was freezing anything,' he says after Toto Wolff claimed talks were on hold. 'We are constantly talking with the team. I still have a contract for a whole year on top of this one. I see my future with Mercedes. I am really happy there.' 2.22pm: Rosberg is asked if Mercedes made him apologise: ‘They can’t make me apologise,' is his reponse. 'It was a decision that came from me after hearing people’s opinions. I felt it was my responsibility. What changed? ‘Time’. He replies. 2.27pm: Rosberg is the quizzed on the 'psychological war', and how important it is in the battle for the title... 'Of course in sport it plays a part. Your performances is linked to many things and your mental state of mind is always important.' 2.30pm: Alonso, Rosberg and Hamilton are asked if the FIA should have taken a closer look at the incident because Rosberg extended his lead in the championship… . ALONSO: I don’t know why I need to answer so many questions. I do not want to answer because I have no clear input. It is FIA rules and they want us to race in a fair way and to respect the rules and they try to do that and if in Spa they did not go any further, they thought it was OK. I was not in that incident, and I was not involved. I have no clear opinion. ROSBERG: We need to trust the FIA to make the right calls. HAMILTON: I think the FIA have a really tough job. They have done an exceptional job on majority of calls. The scenarios are always different, so the same rule does not always apply. But I think it is a very good question to be honest because how do we move forward from that? We are always asking to race because it is hard out there to manoeuvre at high speeds without contact, but it is a really good question. 2.33pm: End of press conference...","Hamilton and Rosberg selected for Italian Grand Prix press conference .

"Cardiff's South Korean midfielder Kim Bo-kyung and agents Carly Barnes and Phil Smith were all allegedly discussed in the text message exchange between Malky Mackay and Iain Moody. Sportsmail’s investigation into allegations of racist, sexist and homophobic texts ended on Thursday night with a public apology from Malky Mackay and the resignation of Crystal Palace sporting director Iain Moody. The text exchanges outlined in Sportsmail’s exclusive report date back to when Mackay and Moody worked as manager and head of recruitment at Cardiff City, before both were sacked by club owner Vincent Tan amid claims of over-spending in the transfer market. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Malky Mackay apologise for sending 'inappropriate' texts . Investigation: Malky Mackay (right) and Iain Moody have been accused of being racist, sexist and homophobic in a series of text messages dating back to their time together at Cardiff City . Tan launched a £750,000 investigation, conducted by law firm Mishcon de Reya. The series of deeply offensive text messages were discovered during a raid on Moody’s London home in March. After a meeting his employers at Selhurst Park, Moody resigned on Thursday. Mackay issued a poorly worded statement through the League Managers’ Association. ‘In the course of a search by the club in early 2014 of 10,000 private text messages sent to and from another member of staff, it emerged that Malky had, it seems, sent a couple of one-line texts that were, with the benefit of hindsight, very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures,’ said the statement. CARLY BARNES - AGENT AND LAWYER . WHAT WAS SAID: ‘I hope she’s looking after your needs. I bet you’d love a bounce on her falsies.’ THE RESPONSE: Carly Barnes was unavailable for comment on Thursday. Victim: Agent Carly Barnes was discussed in text messages allegedly sent on Iain Moody's phone . PHIL SMITH - AGENT . WHAT WAS SAID: ‘Go on, fat Phil. Nothing like a Jew that sees money slipping through his fingers!!!’ THE RESPONSE: ‘It was unnecessary. Agents can be fair game. I understand that. But it’s offensive. In today’s society racism is wholly unacceptable and sport should be no different. It’s part of our society and it should set an example. ‘I don’t know if there was any malice but people have to be more aware and more responsible. As a Jewish person - and with what is going on in Europe at the moment the Jewish community is feeling pretty vulnerable - this kind of thing doesn’t help. We all support anti-racism in sport and now that I have been asked to say something I’m going to take the opportunity. ‘If you want to call me fat, I don’t care. But to say it’s good to see a Jew suffer, that’s not good. ‘I don’t want to be judgmental because I think they have enough problems but this isn’t just football - it’s real life - and there is no place for language like that.’ Unnecessary: Agent Phil Smith, pictured with Claudio Ranieri, said racism is wholly unacceptable in society . KIM BO-KYUNG - CARDIFF CITY MIDFIELDER . WHAT WAS SAID: ‘Fkn chinkys.’ ‘Fk it. There’s enough dogs in Cardiff for us all to go around.’ THE RESPONSE: Kim's agent Lee Yeung-Joong responded via email. 'Surely, we have checked all reports from the UK regarding the manager Mackay and his right hand man Iain Moody related with our player Kim Bo-Kyung. 'Regardless Mackay had mentioned that kind of Racist words by text, we never received any unfair treatments from him and Cardiff City football club at all. 'When Kim firstly joined Cardiff in 2012 summer, just after London Olympic, Mackay had given a lot of considerations for the player and our staffs. 'Kim couldn’t understand English well at that time, and our staff could be always with the player and support him very well, at all home, away games, locker room and all of team meetings, even it was not allowed to anyone. Also, Mackay had spent a lot of times with Kim for his adaptation and match performances always. 'Mackay has very strong character, as everyone knows, and he could say worst words on the pitch, but it was just a WORD, and he always has shown warmest hearts and faith to the player and all of our agency staffs as well. 'This is all what I can tell you about this rumor.' International: South Korean midfielder Kim Bo-Kyung joined Cardiff during the summer of 2012 . The LMA wish to clarify the position in relation to recent reports and speculation regarding matters alleged to have arisen during Malky Mackay’s time at Cardiff City FC. In the course of a search by the Club in early 2014 of 10,000 private text messages sent to and from another member of staff during Mr Mackay’s employment at Cardiff, in relation to other matters, it emerged that Malky had, it seems, sent a couple of one line texts that were, with the benefit of hindsight, very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures. These were two text messages sent in private at a time Malky felt under great pressure and when he was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter. That said, Malky believes he could and should have conducted himself better on these two isolated occasions. The precise details need to remain private for the time being until any FA process is complete. The LMA does not condone in any way any potential breach of equal opportunities laws but would also point out that out of over 10,000 text messages and 70,000 documents produced over a long period of time it may not be a complete surprise that some inappropriate comments can sometimes be made by employees, like Malky, working under great pressure in highly charged situations. If Malky has caused any offence by these two isolated matters he would, however, wish to sincerely apologise. Malky finds it strange that these matters were only raised with the FA and in the media now, 8 months after his employment ended and the day before he was reported as being offered the opportunity to become manager of Crystal Palace FC. Malky is also very concerned about seriously inaccurate and misleading reports of his alleged involvement in these matters in the media. It has never been alleged that he wrote any homophobic or sexist messages and he has confirmed that he did not do so. Further, there are incorrect and damaging suggestions that he sent a whole host of offensive and unpleasant messages that are simply not true and which give a grossly distorted and unfair view of Malky’s involvement in this matter. Malky looks forward to matters being put straight in due course, following any investigation of this matter. Malky cannot of course comment on the nature of any conduct or communications alleged to have been made by others. Malky has said that he will be fully co-operating with any FA investigation and that he looks forward to putting the record straight thereafter.","Malky Mackay and Iain Moody reported to FA after series of texts .

"President Barack Obama was warned by intelligence officials about the threat presented by the Islamic State at least a year before it began its murderous rampage across Iraq, a news report revealed on Tuesday. A Pentagon official familiar with the President's Daily Brief told Fox News that anyone at the White House who read the report 'could not come away with any other impression: This is getting bad.' The Pentagon official's claims are consistent with those of other sources in the intelligence community and regional experts who have said it's improbable that the president was caught off guard by the rise of the Islamic extremist group. President Barack Obama reportedly ignored briefings for at least a year before ISIS struck in Iraq warning him about the danger the group posed to the country . 'It could have been a surprise for the average citizen. But I do not . believe to the United States government it was a surprise, Tariq . al-Hashimi, an exiled Iraqi vice president, told the Daily Beast in early July. 'Everything is monitored, you can always see where ISIS is, it’s easy to . trace them. I just don’t believe they were caught by surprise.' The official who spoke to Fox News described the briefings President Obama received as 'granular' in detail and the information provided as it pertains to Syria was 'exquisite.' '[We] were ready to fire, on a moment's notice, on a couple hundred . targets,' the source told Fox. Some targets were even in their sights for a 'long period of time.' But the president chose not to act, the source said. Nor did he request additional information on activities of ISIS including in his daily briefing. Speaking to John Catsimatidis during his The Cats Roundtable radio show, former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney latched on to Fox's report and said that the violence in Iraq could have been avoided if Obama had acted a year ago when he was told there 'was . significant chance that [Islamic extremists] would go into Iraq and invade a city . there.' 'Those mistakes were made and now we have . ISIS,' Romney said, according to the Christian Post. 'The president failed to take action. He watched. We saw ISIS roll into Iraq. Instead of attacking them immediately and . not knocking them in their convoy, when it would have been easy to knock . down, the president again watched,' he continued. 'Now we are in a position where ISIS . has run throughout major portions of Iraq. There have been horrific . human rights abuses, tragedies including those upon American . journalists. Now we are in a difficult position.' An intelligence official told the Daily Beast in July that while the fall of the second largest city in Iraq was surprising, analysts had been telling the White House since the beginning of 2013 about 'growing problems and deficiencies within the Iraqi Security Forces.' Among their concerns were 'leadership . shortfalls' and a 'steady degradation in capabilities that was making it . difficult for Iraqi Security Forces to combat ISIS.' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest denied on Tuesday that President Obama was aware of intelligence forewarning him about ISIS longer than he's let on. ''I’m not sure when the President would have suggested that,' Earnest said. President Barack Obama greets U.S. and Estonian members of the military with Estonian Prime Minister Taavi Roivas at a hangar after delivering a speech at Tallinn Airport in Tallinn, Estonia this morning. The president made a one-day trip to the country on his way to Wales for a NATO summit . 'I’m not in a position to give out details of the President’s Daily Briefing,' he added. 'But I can tell you that for years the President and other members of his national security team have expressed our concern about extremist elements in Syria and the impact -- the destabilizing impact they could have on the broader region.' The Pentagon official who spoke with Fox also says that the White House waited longer than it could have to embark on a rescue mission to save American journalist James Foley from being slaughtered at the hands of ISIS. Fox says its source in the Pentagon claims the Commander in Chief was informed that a 'large, heavily armed compound, believed to be housing Foley, and other . potential captives, was identified near the ISIS stronghold of Raqaa, . Syria.' But the White House opted not to strike, the source said, because it was waiting for the 'intelligence to build up more.","A Pentagon official claims Obama was forewarned about ISIS in his Presidential Daily Briefing .

"Room for improvement has been the saying for this international week but it is not a theme exclusive to England’s senior team. Thanks to a late header from Harry Kane, Gareth Southgate’s unbeaten record as Under-21 head coach but if he is to lead England to Euro 2015, he will recognise a step up is required on this grinding 1-0 victory over Lithuania. For long periods, England were frustrated by Lithuania’s stubborn defence and given they will be paired against superior opposition when the play-off draw is made next Friday, there are areas for Southgate to polish as he plots a path to the Czech Republic. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Harry Kane's late winner for England U21s vs Lithuania . Winners: Substitute Harry Kane challenges for a header during the match at Darius Girenas Stadium . Team: Kane (right) celebrates with his team-mates after scoring the winner for England U21s . Pre-match: The England team line-up for a photo before the kick-off in Kaunas .

Subs not used: Forster-Caskey, Lascelles, Bond, Blackett. Goals: Kane (81) Bookings: Chalobah (57), Ward-Prowse (74) Attendance: 3000 . It must be recognised, though, that England continue to be able to find a way of winning these matches and Kane’s 81st minute effort means they have collected 25 points from a possible 27 in Group One with one final assignment in Moldova remaining. ‘We expected a difficult game and we knew they would defend deep,’ said Southgate. ‘But I was pleased that we were patient. We kept passing the ball and the beauty of having a strong squad means that we always have options. We thought we always had another gear.’ When these nations met in Ipswich last October, England ran riot with Ravel Morrison inspiring a 5-0 win but it was clear from an early stage they were not going to find this assignment as straightforward as the one at Portman Road. If anything, the first 45 minutes were the most laboured this qualification campaign. When England arrived here on Thursday evening, the focus of training had been on short, sharp passing and slick movement but they failed to put that into practice. Most surprisingly, England looked vulnerable in defence and they were lucky not to fall behind in the 14th minute when, after a sloppy clearance from Jack Butland, Lithuania were able to raid forward but Tomas Birskys failed to punish the error when firing over the bar. Super Sub: Harry Kane came on in the 64th minute to score the only goal of the game . Scrap: Both goalkeepers were at the same end of the pitch as Lithuania pushed for an equaliser . Talent: West Brom's Saido Berahino puts in a tackle for England U21s . England replied with a couple of half chances – Nathaniel Chalobah, who would later pick up a booking that rules him out of Tuesday’s game in Moldova, shot wide before James Ward-Prowse was off target – but they did not threaten to get Lithuania panicking. By contrast, a melee at the other end should have saw Lithuania take the lead in the 39th minute but Chalobah hacked a shot from Lukas Baranauskas off the line; it wasn’t good enough and the way Southgate briskly walked back to the dressing room at the break confirmed as much. Whatever Southgate said during the interval had some effect, as England started the second period much brighter. Saido Berahino forced the first meaningful save from Tomas Svedkauskas after a sharp move, one that was met with applause from Southgate. Slowly but surely, England went through the gears as Nathan Redmond and Tom Ince started to have an influence. Redmond, in particular, was unlucky not to give England the lead when he hit the bar with a volley that skidded up off the turf. It then became a question of whether Lithuania could hold out but their resistance was broken eventually when Kane rose highest to flick an inviting cross from Ward-Prowse’s beyond the grasp of Svedkauskas. ‘Harry is a goalscorer,’ said Southgate. ‘He is really knocking on the door now. We put him on at that stage of the game when they were tiring and he gave us different options. He is a penalty box player and it was a very good finish. I’m pleased we were able to get the job done.’","Gareth Southgate had a near full-strength squad going into the match .

"A woman has spent the last 15 years of her life looking eight months pregnant due to a mystery bowel condition. Joanne Turton, 33, says the disorder has left her with a severely bloated her stomach since she was 18. Now, after thinking she would never find a cure, doctors have trialled her on a revolutionary machine which instantly relieved her symptoms. Miss Turton, who has a five-year-old . daughter, said: 'Ever since I've had this condition, I've had a bloated . stomach and it looks like I am eight months pregnant. Scroll down for video . Painful: Joanne Turton says she has spent the last 15 years looking heavily pregnant due to an undiagnosed bowel condition that bloats her stomach . Uncomfortable: Miss Turton says her stomach hurts all the time and she suffers from stabbing pains . 'It hurts all the time and I get stabbing pains in my side. 'It has affected me all my life and means I can't go out and socialise with friends like a normal person.' But a pacemaker-like device, put into the bowel to regulate her movements, could hold the key to her recovery. The operation is known as a gastric electrical stimulation procedure. She said: 'When I had the trial they put it on the outside of my body with a tube leading down my throat. 'It instantly made me feel better and for the first time, I felt normal. Miss Turton said she can only find one other example of anyone else having the procedure. After searching on the internet, Miss Turton said only one other similar diagnosis could be found - a patient living in America. Since the trial, she has been told she can have the operation to have the device fitted permanently - finally putting an end to her suffering. Gastric electrical stimulation (GES) uses a device implanted in the abdomen to send mild electrical pulses to the nerves and smooth muscle of the lower stomach. It is conventionally used to help patients with gastroparesis, a condition affecting the nerves and muscles of the stomach, delaying the emptying of food from the stomach into the small intestine. Several different conditions can cause gastroparesis, including diabetes and nervous system disorders, although in many cases the cause isn't known. GES is used to treat patients with gastroparesis but only in patients whose symptoms can't be controlled by medication. The pocket watch-sized device, called a neurostimulator is surgically implanted in the right side of the abdomen. But last week, days before the operation was due to take place, she was told it would not be going ahead as planned. She said: 'I was so excited to finally be getting . the operation. It was a relief knowing there was finally a light at the . end of the tunnel. 'Now I've been left in limbo and I don't know what is happening.' Miss Turton was originally told her operation would be taking place at Castle Hill Hospital, near Hull, on April 9. But last week, when she phoned to get a confirmation letter so her mother could get time off work to look after her daughter, Miss Turton was told the operation had been cancelled. She tried phoning her own GP and her surgeon to find out what had happened. Some medical professionals told her the operation had been cancelled, while others thought it would be taking place in Scotland. Now, NHS Hull Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), the body that funds operations for people living in the city, starting from April 1, says it will fund the procedure, but cannot confirm when or where it will take place. Miss Turton said: 'I was arranging for someone to look after my daughter and I had started packing my bag ready for April 9. 'I'm relieved the CCG has said it is still being funded, and not cancelled, but I still don't have a proper answer. 'I was all set to go to Castle Hill on April 9, but now I'm not sure what is going on.' A spokesman for NHS Hull CCG said funding for Miss Turton's treatment had been approved by its Exceptional Treatment Panel. Waiting: She is now waiting for an operation date to have the revolutionary device fitted. It involves putting a pacemaker-like device into the bowel to regulate movements . They also explained it would not be taking place at either Hull Royal Infirmary or Castle Hill Hospital - the two bases run by Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust. The spokesman said: 'The funding for Miss Turton's treatment was approved by Hull CCG Exceptional Treatment Panel and this funding remains in place. 'The highly specialised nature of the gastric electrical stimulation procedure means that few centres in the country are accredited to undertake it. 'Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust is not one of these accredited centres. 'It is extremely regrettable that the communication with Miss Turton did not make it clear that her procedure would need to be carried out with an accredited provider. ""This is a matter we are urgently reviewing internally and in conjunction with Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust. 'In the meantime, we would encourage Miss Turton to either contact her doctor or the CCG directly to discuss this matter further.'","Joanne Turton, 33, says the disorder has made her severely bloated .

"Manchester City have turned down the chance to sign Angel Di Maria twice in the past year, with the most recent opportunity arriving earlier this month. The Real Madrid winger is on the brink of joining Manchester United in a deal that could be worth in excess of £60 million, a figure that will shatter the British transfer record. It is understood that the Argentina player has been offered to United’s rivals in both of the last two transfer windows. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Angel di Maria: The story so far .

City, however, have not been interested in pursuing a move over the last year and a well-placed source told Sportsmail that the club were ‘never in for him’ this summer. They are also attempting to remain within the restrictions of UEFA’s Financial Fair Play restrictions and such a deal may have negated City’s capacity to recruit in defence and midfield, which was felt to be a priority.

"Despite appalling weather across much of the east coast yesterday, a double rainbow was pictured in the sky above Marine One as it sat on the tarmac at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland. The helicopter was waiting for the arrival of President Barack Obama, who was flying in on Air Force One on his was to give a speech at Laborfest in Milwaukee. For much of the east coast Labor Day was marred by heavy thunderstorms as three men were hit by lightning on New York beach and play was stopped at the US Open. Scroll down for video . A double rainbow appeared in the sky above Marine One at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, yesterday as the crew waited for the arrival of Barack Obama . Electric Zoo festival, on Randall Island, was also cancelled after heavy rain flooded the site. But further down the coast in Maryland the President enjoyed a brief moment of sunshine as the clouds parted and a rainbow appeared across the sky. Rainbows are caused when light refracts as it enters a raindrop, splitting it into different wavelengths which are seen by the eye as different colors. Double rainbows occur when the light is reflected as it leaves a raindrop, producing a second, fainter, rainbow nearby, only with the bands of color reversed. Obama stopped briefly at the air base before flying on to Milwaukee where he gave a speech at an event on raising the minimum wage ahead of midterm elections in fall. He also made an appearance at the same air base on Saturday as he travelled with First Lady Michelle to the wedding of long-time personal chef and friend Sam Kass. Mr Kass and MSNBC host Alex Wagner were tying the knot in an evening ceremony at Blue Hill at Stone Barns, a farm-to-table restaurant in Pocantico Hills, just north of New York City. Obama stopped at the air base on his way to Milwaukee where he gave a speech in an attempt to bring in votes ahead of the fall midterm elections . Obama and Kass have a close relationship, which Obama highlighted earlier this month by spending hours at dinner at Kass' apartment amid the turmoil in Iraq, Ukraine and Ferguson, Missouri. Thunderstorms are forecast from Upstate New York and Vermont to West Virginia today, with the weather becoming more settled and sunny into midweek. However as the weekend approaches another the humidity and heat will rise and there are chances of more storms as the next cold front approaches.","Double rainbow pictured during a break in the rain on east coast yesterday .

"Joan Rivers' daughter has signed up a Manhattan legal powerhouse and will launch a multimillion-dollar law suit against the endoscopy clinic where the comedienne fell into a coma. Heartbroken Melissa Rivers, 46, will file a multimillion-dollar medical malpractice and wrongful death lawsuit against Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic and is working with top firm Gair, Gair, Conason, Steigman, Mackauf, Bloom & Rubinowitz. Today, the firm told MailOnline: 'In order to fully determine all of the facts and  circumstances surrounding the death of Joan Rivers we confirm that our firm has been engaged by Melissa Rivers and her family.' Scroll down for video . Gone too soon: Comic icon Joan Rivers fully expected to exit the Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic after her procedure to meet up with friends. Instead, the 81-year old went into cardiac arrest and died days later . Heartbroken: Melissa Rivers has hired a top NYC law firm to launch legal action against the clinic where her mother suffered cardiac arrest following a routine endoscopy, leading to her death on September 4 . The doctors involved in carrying out what was meant to be a routine throat procedure, named previously as Dr Lawrence Cohen and Dr Gwen Korovin, will also be named in the suit, according to the New York Post. The news come after family friends confirmed to MailOnline that heartbroken Melissa planned to sue the clinic following her mother's death age 81 on September 4. Earlier this month, the friend said: 'Melissa does plan to sue the clinic. It's very difficult to discuss something so unpleasant with her, but she is going to launch a lawsuit. Questions from friends and family that have yet to be answered include whether there was actually an anesthesiologist present as Joan underwent the endoscopy. Gair, Gair, Conason, Steigman, Mackauf, Bloom & Rubinowitz is one of the oldest law firms in New York City, founded in 1919, and is said to be 'highly selective' about its cases. BFFs: Distraught Melissa posted a picture of her son Cooper and her mother Joan, writing: 'Connecticut, 2004. Mom + Cooper = BFFs... A perfect day. #TBT' Still working: Dr Gwen Korovin is still working at her Manhattan office. She charges $460 for an initial consultation and does not accept insurance. She is believed to have been in the room at Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic when Joan Rivers went into cardiac arrest on August 28 . ​Rivers’ official cause of death is “anoxic encephalopathy due to hypoxic arrest during laryngoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with propofol sedation.” The firm needs to obtain Joan's medical records before filing a case in Manhattan Supreme Court and her will also needs to submitted to court and an executor appointed by the judge. It won $3 million for the Diallo family and recen​​tly scored a whopping $27.5 million verdict for a New York City woman who was run over by an MTA bus. Joan suffered cardiac arrest following an endoscopy at Yorkville on August 28. Paramedics then rushed the star to New York's Mount Sinai Hospital a mile away, where she was kept on life support until she died a week later. CNN reported that a source close to the investigation into Joan's death being carried out by the New York State Department of Health said she suffered a cardiac arrest following the endoscopy as her personal doctor, believed to be Dr Gwen Korovin, performed an 'unauthorized procedure'. According to CNN, several clinic workers told investigators the procedure began with Dr Korovin performing a laryngoscopy, which involves using a device to view a patient's vocal folds. Doctor of choice: Dr Korovin - pictured at her Manhattan home last month - counts celebrities including Hugh Jackman - who performed at Joan Rivers' funeral, Daniel Radcliffe, Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande among her famous patients . Gone: Gastroenterologist Dr Lawrence Cohen, the medical director of Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic, stepped down from his position. He carried out an endoscopy on Joan Rivers on August 28. It was later reported he had allowed a specialist, who was not authorized to practice at the clinic, to examine the star . Dr. Lawrence Cohen, a longtime gastroenterologist, then performed an endoscopy to diagnose why she was suffering a sore throat and hoarseness, the source said. The clinic, however, denies reports that a vocal cord biopsy was performed moments before Joan went into cardiac arrest. Legal action: Melissa Rivers is set to file a law suit against Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic in NYC . Dr Korovin - who charges $460 for an initial consultation and does NOT take insurance - was authorized only to observe Dr Cohen, since she was not certified by Yorkville Endoscopy clinic, as required by New York health law, the source told CNN. Dr Korovin, 56, is an esteemed ear, nose and throat specialist who counts Hugh Jackman, Julie Andrews, Lady Gaga, pop princess Ariana Grande and Celine Dion among her celebrity patients. Sources close to the specialist have already been forced to deny that Dr Korovin took a 'selfie' picture while Joan was under anesthesia. Dr. Korovin's  lawyer, Michael Kelton, released a statement to MailOnline, saying:  'Gwen S. Korovin, M.D. is a highly experienced, board certified otolaryngologist. She maintains privileges at one of the city's most prestigious hospitals. She is respected and admired by her peers in the medical community and she is revered by her patients. 'As a matter of personal and professional policy, Dr. Korovin does not publicly discuss her patients or their care and treatment. Further, Dr. Korovin is prohibited by state and federal confidentiality laws from discussing her care and treatment of any particular patient. 'For these reasons, neither Dr. Korovin nor her attorneys will have any public comment on recent press reports regarding her practice. We ask that the press please respect Dr. Korovin's personal and professional policy of not discussing her patients, as well as the privacy of her patients.' Famous clientele: Dr Gwen Korovin, who was in the room when Joan Rivers underwent her ill-fated procedure, counts Celine Dion as one of her patients. In the singer's 2010 documentary, Dr Korovin performs a laryngoscopy on the star and they talk about her resting her vocal chords . Celeb doctor: Pop princess Ariana Grande posted a picture of Dr Korovin giving her a B12 shot in her bottom before an appearance with Jimmy Fallon . Dr Korovin is still believed to be working and accepting new patients, although Mr Kelton's office declined to comment, While Dr Cohen has stepped down from Yorkville Endoscopy clinic. Meanwhile, the New York Medical Examiner's Office has yet to release the exact cause of death for Joan Rivers.","Heartbroken Melissa Rivers is working with Gair, Gair, Conason, Steigman, Mackauf, Bloom & Rubinowitz .

I'm screaming at him, waving my arms like crazy thinking maybe he made a mistake because I was hoping it wasn't what I thought it was.' But her fears were confirmed around ten seconds later when she received a text saying the driver had cancelled the pick up, it was reported by NBC New York. Mrs Dixon, who lost her vision around seven years ago, managed to get another Uber car to take her home. Uber said it had fired the driver. 'Built to expand transportation options for all': Uber said it had fired the driver after being told of the incident . In a statement, it said: 'The Uber app is built to expand access to transportation options for all, including users with visual impairments and other disabilities. 'It is Uber's policy that any driver partner that refuses to transport a service animal will be deactivated from the Uber platform, which has been done in this case.' Mrs Dixon welcomed the response, but said all drivers needed to be educated about service dogs. She added: 'As soon as they sign a contract to be an Uber driver, they have to obey the law, plain and simple.' Uber is a ride-sharing service that allow users to request taxis through an app which are then dispatched to drivers.

"Most of Ian McEwan's novels come in at 200 pages or fewer . With some of his most acclaimed works coming in at barely 200 pages, Ian McEwan is known for his ability to write concisely. But it is a skill the novelist said is missing from some of his contemporaries, as he criticised the growing trend of blockbuster novels – often running to as many as 900 pages – saying few ‘earn their length’ and many are in need of editing. Speaking yesterday to Radio Four’s Today programme, The Man Booker and Jerusalem Prize winner, 66, said that when reading such lengthy tomes, ‘My fingers are always twitching for a blue pencil.’ And asked what he thought of the trend more generally – the interviewer Mishal Husain singled out The Goldfinch (880 pages) and The Luminaries (848 pages) as examples – McEwan said: ‘The Americans especially love a really huge novel, they still pursue the notion of a great American novel and it has to be a real brick of an object. Very few really long novels earn their length.’ Giving the interview to publicise his sixteenth novel, The Children Act – published today and which comes in at 224 pages – McEwan was asked if his works were too short to be counted as novels and should instead be seen as novellas. He said: ‘I would arbitrarily put the novella at 40,000 words and this is maybe 15,000 words more than that. If we can make this fine distinction, it’s a short novel rather than a novella. ‘But I do love this form, the idea of sitting down with a book that you could read in one sitting or within three hours, much as you might go to a movie or an opera or a long play. ‘I think you’ve got to establish characters very quickly, there’s room for one or two subplots, it’s a form I adore actually.’ Speaking about the themes running through The Children Act, which sees the courts intervene when a teenager refuses a lifesaving blood transfusion because of his faith as a Jehovah’s Witness, he said: ‘I would say that it’s fine for adults to die for their faith, as long as they harm no one else, but children who have had no other take on the world presented to them, I think this is the point the law must intervene. The Goldfinch (left) by Donna Tartt (right) is much too long at 880 pages . ‘I think if you had asked me in the 1980s the future of faith, I would have said it was endlessly diminished but now it does seem to be centre stage. As for religion in schools, my view is teach comparative religions, teach all religions but basically let children grow up to make their own minds, I’m more with the French on this.’ In the wide-ranging interview, he also addressed the rise of e-readers, such as Amazon’s Kindle, in the place of traditional paper books. It is a shift McEwan said he is relaxed about, although did admit to concerns over how it is currently being delivered. He said: ‘I don’t think e-readers make much difference to us at all, there’s still the sentence, the paragraph, the pages, it’s just a method of delivery as far as I am concerned. I do worry about the preponderance of Amazon and many publishers being in direct conflict with it - giant monopolies are never good for any enterprise and of course I would like it to be paying its taxes like the rest of us. ‘The trouble is, it’s like some delicious drug, you can’t really resist it. I’ve forsworn it many times than I want a book the next morning so I’m much like anyone else. I would just like there to be three or four Amazons, that’s what I’d like.’","Ian McEwan, 66, says his fingers twitch for the blue editing pencil .

"Troubled former England football maestro Paul Gascoigne has said he can overcome the demons which saw him admitted to hospital in a drink-fuelled stupor. The ex-Tottenham Hotspur favourite, whose legacy on the pitch has been overshadowed by alcohol and drug attractions since retiring a decade ago, was treated in hospital in Dorset when he suffered a relapse last week after spending the previous seven months clean. Gascoigne, 46, known as Gazza, told the Sunday Mirror he did not want sympathy or pity - and was determined to stop drinking for good. Scroll down for videos... Care: Gascoigne is pictured having a cigarette at Poole hospital at the weekend but says he will recover . Troubled ex-England star Paul Gascoigne says he can overcome his alcohol addiction . He said: 'I know I can overcome this. I am an alcoholic so I am taking one day at a time, but I will get there.' Gascoigne said he turned to drink after being served with an eviction notice on his flat in the up-market area of Sandbanks, Poole. He said people had been leaving alcohol on his doorstep in the weeks leading up to his latest 'blip'. He told the newspaper: 'Up until a few weeks ago, I was doing great. 'I have an illness and I had a bad moment. Now I want to make sure it doesn't happen again.' Since retiring from football, Gascoigne has been sectioned  under the Mental Health Act and has described how, when he hit rock bottom, he  was snorting cocaine and drinking a litre of gin a day, which left him  delusional and afraid to leave his room. Worry: Gascoigne has struggled with alcoholism and drug addiction since retiring as a footballer . The former England hero went public about his continuing battle with addiction  in 2009, telling BBC Radio 5 Live's Victoria Derbyshire he had been  clean of drink and drugs for four months, taking part in the 12 Steps Programme and  attending Alcoholics Anonymous. Other high-profile incidents involving alcohol included being sacked as manager  of Kettering in 2005 after he was accused of being drunk at games. He also appeared  at the scene of the stand-off between the police and gunman Raoul Moat in 2010.  Arriving in Rothbury, Northumberland, Gazza claimed he was a  friend of Moat and said he had brought him ''a can of lager, some chicken,  fishing rod, a Newcastle shirt and a dressing gown''. But he is still remembered by fans of the clubs he played for - including Newcastle United, Lazio, Rangers, Everton and Middlesbrough - for his brilliance on the pitch. He starred in midfield for  Terry Venables' England side during Euro 96, where his virtuoso goal against  Scotland was topped off with an equally memorable celebration. Six years earlier he was seen crying on the pitch after being booked in the semi-final of the  1990 World Cup against West Germany, the booking making him unable to play in the final.

"Mario Balotelli has left Liverpool's Melwood training ground after going through the rigours of a medical having reached an agreement to join the Premier League club. The former Manchester City striker is on the brink of signing for Brendan Rodgers' side in a deal worth £125,000 per week. Balotelli earlier had scans at Spire Liverpool Hospital before completing the rest of the medical at Melwood. However the Italian will not be available to make his debut against former club Manchester City on Monday night, with the registration deadline of midday having passed.

Unregistered: Balotelli has not been registered as of midday Friday, so cannot play against Man City . Waiting game: Supporters outside Melwood in the hope of catching Balotelli as he left on Friday . Tens of supporters swarmed around the Melwood gates at 9.04pm on Friday as Balotelli left in a people carrier with his entourage. Balotelli's agent held discussions on Thursday and Friday, with a key point believed to be the Merseyside outfit's desire to obtain some kind of guarantee about the discipline of the mercurial 24-year-old Italy striker. The player on Thursday added credence to the reports that he is set to return to English football by saying it would be his last day at Milan's training ground. The Serie A side followed that later with a statement on their website revealing he had said his farewells to his team-mates. Liverpool have been looking for a marquee striker to replace the departed Luis Suarez this summer but their interest in Balotelli represents a remarkable about-turn from around three weeks ago.

Javier Manquillo - Atletico Madrid, loan . Mario Balotelli - AC Milan, £16m . When Liverpool played Milan in a friendly in the United States, manager Brendan Rodgers expressed admiration for Balotelli but subsequently 'categorically' said he was not a target. Recently, however, a move for QPR's Loic Remy has collapsed while interest in former Chelsea striker Samuel Eto'o has cooled and attempts to sign Radamel Falcao from Monaco seem unrealistic. With new signing Rickie Lambert the only frontline support for Daniel Sturridge and the transfer deadline nearing, a move for Balotelli has apparently become more attractive. He is a proven performer and scored Italy's winner in the World Cup opener against England in Manaus. But the baggage that comes with him is considerable. His spell at City from summer 2010 to January 2013 was a whirlwind one, with occasional sparkling performances interspersed with volatility on the field and erratic behaviour off it. Title race: Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers sprints to keep up with Rickie Lambert and Steven Gerrard . Out of time: Brendan Rodgers has not been able to complete the deal in time for Balotelli to face City . Prepared: Rodgers is ready to welcome Balotelli for his medical after agreeing personal terms with the striker . His numerous misdemeanours famously included fireworks being set off in his bathroom, throwing a dart at a youth-team player and training-ground bust-ups with team-mates and manager Roberto Mancini. On the positive side he played a key role in the 2011 FA Cup win and contributed to the following year's Premier League success, but he also hindered progress by accruing four red cards. City - for whom he scored a total of 30 goals in 80 appearances in all competitions - eventually tired of the circus surrounding him and offloaded the former Inter star to his boyhood club AC Milan.

"DAVID Cameron last night ordered a fresh investigation to discover what happened to the missing dossier detailing explosive claims of a Westminster paedophile ring. Ministers including Nick Clegg and Theresa May have been rejecting calls for a full-scale public inquiry into historical child abuse, insisting a police investigation will be sufficient to get to the bottom of the claims. Yesterday, however, the Prime Minister ordered the Home Office’s most senior official to launch an investigation amid claims that the department’s response to the affair so far had been ‘outrageous’. Probe: David Cameron, left, has ordered the most senior Home Office official to investigate a missing dossier handed to Lord Brittan, the former home secretary, by Conservative MP Geoffrey Dickens about an alleged paedophile ring in Westminster in the 1980s . Mr Cameron said he understood mounting . concerns about what happened to the dossier handed over to then Home . Secretary Leon Brittan by Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens in 1983. He said: . ‘That’s why I’ve asked the permanent secretary at the Home Office [Mark . Sedwill] to do everything he can to find answers to all of these . questions and to make sure we can reassure people about these events.’ He . added: ‘If anyone has information about criminal wrong-doing they . should, of course, give it to the police.’ But the Daily Mail can reveal . that only seven detectives have been deployed by Scotland Yard chiefs . to investigate the allegations. The tiny squad has been given the . huge task of investigating historical allegations of child abuse . relating to MPs, a guest house where rent boys entertained Establishment . figures, a children’s home and the notorious Paedophile Information . Exchange. The police inquiry, launched in November 2012, is also . responsible for investigating the activities of the disgraced Liberal MP . Cyril Smith. Sources close to the investigation, which has the . umbrella name Operation Fairbank, say it has been poorly resourced since . day one and claim that Metropolitan Police bosses have shown little . interest in it. Shadow home secretary Yvett Cooper said the 2013 Home Office review was 'not good enough' and led to a 'lack of proper answers' By contrast, nearly 200 detectives have been deployed . on the investigation into phone hacking and bribery allegations . involving journalists, while about 30 officers have been attached to . Operation Yewtree, the Jimmy Savile scandal inquiry into sex crimes . committed by celebrities. The revelation that Scotland Yard boss Sir . Bernard Hogan-Howe and his senior officers put just seven officers on . Operation Fairbank prompted widespread criticism and claims of a . continuing cover-up. Simon Danczuk, one of the original group of . seven cross-party MPs who wrote to the Home Secretary urging her to . launch a ‘Hillsborough-style’ inquiry into the abuse scandal, said: . ‘Theresa May will know that barely a handful of police officers are . assigned to these investigations, so when they claim this is a matter . best left to the police they are essentially consigning it to the . dustbin of history.’ He added: ‘They know full well that proper . resources are needed to get to the bottom of years of cover up to . protect establishment paedophiles, and without this there is no chance . of the truth being uncovered. The public will now rightly want to know . why our political leaders are not doing all they can to expose . establishment paedophiles and bring them to justice.’ Labour MP Mr . Danczuk, who helped expose the full extent of Cyril Smith’s vile . paedophile attacks in a book serialised by the Mail, said more people . have contacted his office in recent days with claims of a child sex ring . at Westminster and naming one particular MP from the 1980s. Responding . to Mr Cameron’s announcement of a fresh investigation, he said: ‘The . Prime Minister knows that there is a growing sense of public anger about . allegations of historical abuse involving senior politicians and his . statement today represents little more than a damage limitation . exercise. ‘It doesn’t go far enough. The public has lost confidence . in these kind of official reviews, which usually result in a whitewash. The only way to get to the bottom of this is a thorough public inquiry.’ From yesterday's Daily Mail: MPs had called for an full-scale public inquiry to be launched . Thursday's Mail: Pressure has been mounting on David Cameron to take action . Demands for a full-scale investigation into an alleged cover-up of a . Westminster paedophile ring increased this week leaving Leon Brittan, . now Lord Brittan,  facing questions over his handling of the explosive . dossier handed to him by Mr Dickens. Lord Brittan has confirmed he . received a ‘substantial bundle of papers’ – which detailed allegations . of a paedophile network within Parliament and Whitehall – and passed . them to his officials for investigation. But amid claims of an Establishment cover-up, the Home Office admits the dossier was either lost or destroyed. An . internal review last year revealed that the Tory peer had written to Mr . Dickens in 1984 saying the dossier had been assessed by prosecutors as . worth pursuing and handed to police. Yet the Mail has learned that the Met can find no record that the Dickens dossier was investigated by the force in the 1980s. Speculation . was mounting that Sir Bernard and Commander Graham McNulty, who is . overseeing the Westminster paedophile ring investigation, could be . hauled before MPs to explain the alleged under-resourcing of the . inquiry.","Most senior Home Office official will investigate alleged paedophile ring .

"Louis van Gaal's horrendous start as Manchester United manager got even worse on Tuesday night as his side were dumped out of the Capital One Cup by MK Dons.

But Van Gaal asked supporters for more time, saying: ‘Fans have to believe in our philosophy, we are building a team which we cannot make in one month or even one year.

I have seen them trying to do their best so you cannot expect more. We made big errors and you can’t make these errors as it’s tough to come back. We didn’t have the luck to score but at least we have created a lot of chances.’ The night started in a buoyant mood for the travelling fans after United sealed a British record £59.7million deal for Angel di Maria. But United collapsed in the second-round tie despite having seven internationals in their side and finishing 47 places higher than Karl Robinson’s team last season.

He said: ‘I have no regrets on the team selection. Don’t forget we have a young team and nine injuries and we have to play for the second time within 48 hours. I couldn’t play with the squad I used on Sundays so I had to look at the second team and the youth team. ‘Of course I am disappointed but I can analyse this. Am I shocked? No, I am not shocked because I know what can happen and I know MK Dons played very well, very aggressively and they had a bit of luck also with the goals.’ United fans were outraged that Van Gaal casually signed autographs after the game, but the Dutchman again pleaded with them to have faith in his rebuilding project. Finish: Arsenal loanee Benik Afoba (left) losts home under pressure from Keane for 3-0 . Poor: Manchester United have started the season poorly, with two defeats and a draw . He said: ‘When you start as a manager in the Premier League with a home loss and then a draw and after that you lose a cup match then it is very disappointing. It’s very difficult for the fans to believe in my philosophy. But they have to do that because I am here to build up a new team and that takes time. ‘I haven’t just been saying that this week, but last week and even when we were winning everything in the United States on our pre-season tour.’ While United were utterly dejected, the Dons were in raptures. Robinson said: ‘I’m a bit shocked to be walking off and seeing the scoreline. It’s ridiculous, it’s something that dreams are made of for these players. We work hard and you’ve seen a youthful energy in the team. ‘They’ve got the superstars in the side and they’re the ones that are in the public eye on a daily basis, an hourly basis to an extent, we’re not.’ Overlooking: Ryan Giggs (left) and Van Gaal look on from the bench ahead of the game at stadiummk .

"A city's independent traders are launching their own currency to boost local businesses and prevent it becoming another victim of 'Clone Town Britain'. Organisers hope the Bristol pound will stop big companies and bankers swallowing up cash that is desperately needed by hard pressed local firms. Over 100 business have already signed up to accept the new currency, which goes into circulation in May, including a family bakery, local theatre, dozens of small cafes and Somerset brewed Thatcher's Cider. The currency has been launched in Bristol to help the local economy and prevent big companies 'hoovering up' cash from local trade . Notes will printed in £1, £5, £10 and £20 denominations, with one Bristol Pound worth exactly £1 sterling. Consumers can open an account with the Bristol Credit Union, which is administering the scheme. This money can then either be cashed for the notes or used electronically to pay bills online or even with a mobile phone. The currency has the backing of the Financial Services Authority (FSA) and will have the same protection as any other deposit account. Ciaran Mundy, the director of the Bristol Pound, said the scheme hoped to keep cash in the city. He said: 'This will be money created by the people of Bristol for the Bristol people. 'Big companies just hoover up money from a local area. 'Massive shops with massive marketing and advertising budgets can easily wipe out local businesses. 'Money goes into their financial system and typically out into London and into the offshore sector. 'We'll be driving to get more money going to independent traders, to ensure we continue to keep the diversity of our city. Keeping it local: The Bristol pound will be available in several denominations and will help retain the 'diversity of the city' 'One of the reasons people love living here is because it's got a massive number of diverse, independent traders. 'Sometimes we don't realise what we've got until it's gone. 'The whole town clone town Britain hasn't yet happened in Bristol yet, but there have been a lot of independent firms that have struggled. 'We have seen the shutters go up in and around Bristol. 'We also hope that visitors to the city will change a bit of money while they are here. 'It's a serious goal, but it will also be a bit of a novelty and fun for tourists.' The organisers are holding  a competition to help design the new notes, although they have already created a logo, and produced security features to counter forgery. There is a silver hologram design, a gold foil strip with serial numbers embedded and other features which are impossible to reproduce. Barbara Janke (corr), leader of Bristol City Council, said: 'This is a chance to demonstrate the economic resilience of the city. 'We want to make it as easy as possible for people to use the Bristol Pound.' The Totnes Pound was the first to launch, in Devon in 2006 and has 70 traders involved. Eighteen months ago Stroud, in Gloucestershire, starting printing its own currency, but to date no more than 30 firms are taking the money.",Bristol launches own currency to maintain 'diversity' of city and support independent trade .
"A five-year-old is thought to have become one of the world’s youngest Karate black belts - despite battling juvenile arthritis. Jake Frood took up the martial art aged just three after watching the classic film, The Karate Kid. The youngster, from Leeds, West Yorkshire, enrolled at the city’s National Martial Arts College and now hopes to become a fully trained instructor by his tenth birthday. Scroll down for video . Jake Frood, five, has become one of the world's youngest Karate black belts despite having arthritis and an immune disorder. He suffers from stiffness in his limbs and falls ill frequently . He has achieved one of the sport’s top accolades despite suffering joint stiffness due to his condition. His mother, Kerry Frood, 31, said: ‘He watched the Karate Kid and absolutely loved it and has just gone from strength to strength. ‘There is no-one else at his age that we can find who has been given a black belt. ‘It’s just unbelievable and without martial arts he wouldn’t be the person he is today. ‘People just can’t believe how young he is and he is so small for his age too.’ Jake, who is just 3ft tall, was recently awarded his black belt after completing a gruelling challenge which included a two-mile run and four-hour martial arts test. Jake took up martial arts after watching The Karate Kid when he was three-years-old. His mother, Kerry, believes the sport has helped him to overcome his health problems . Ms Frood, who works as a nurse, said: ‘When Jake was first diagnosed with arthritis at three years old his legs were so weak. ‘He tried physiotherapy, but found it far too difficult. ‘He had started martial arts by this point and, even though he was finding that hard too, the doctors told him to keep on with it as it would make his legs stronger. ‘So he kept up with it and has flourished as a true champion. His legs are much stronger now too.’ Jake, who is just 3ft tall, was recently awarded his black belt after completing a gruelling challenge which included a two-mile run and four-hour martial arts test . She added: ‘I don’t think there are many children his age that could do what Jake does. He might be small but he is hard as nails, I’m so proud of what he has achieved.’ Jake also suffers from an immune disorder, which doctors are currently trying to get to the bottom of. His mother said: ‘Jake will always catch every single illness that is going round. His immune system is very, very weak. ‘But because of his love for martial arts he battles everything that comes his way.’ Ms Frood said: 'Jake will always catch every single illness that is going round. His immune system is very, very weak. But because of his love for martial arts he battles everything that comes his way' The youngster has had through several illnesses and operations and was even back training weeks after surgery on his hand. Ms Frood said: ‘He was back on the mat at martial arts within weeks of his op as he didn’t want to fall behind. Juvenile arthritis is that which occurs before a child turns 16. It causes one or more of the joints to become swollen, painful and stiff. Some children with arthritis also suffer eye and teeth problems as well as slow growth. Treatment options include steroids, painkillers and anti-inflammatory medications. Many people who have juvenile arthritis find their symptoms disappear before they reach adulthood. Source: Arthritis Research UK . ‘Martial arts have definitely saved his life and made him a stronger person. ‘Without his love for it he wouldn’t have had the determination to get through his illnesses. ‘He’s now saying that he wants to open up his own martial arts school when he grows up and by the age of 10 he should be a qualified instructor.’ Jake, who has a nine-year-old brother called Junior, is now set to take his black belt into school to show off to his classmates.

'I was drugged and raped by that man,' Barbara revealed. Today she told of her reaction to the memes. 'The Cosby meme-ing was a sight to see,' she told MailOnline. 'I'm grateful that the critical masses are now paying attention to, and are taking seriously, the reality and truth about Bill Cosby and his evil deeds. 'Rape is nothing to joke about, but Twitter has been used as a vessel for communication of the highest magnitude and has been used as an outlet for people to express their disgust with the rapist.' Barbara said that although Bill Cosby had not been prosecuted, the public reaction agaisnt him was clear. 'However, he now must endure the scorn and humiliation that came to pass as a result of his invitation to the public to express their feelings about him using Twitter as an outlet. 'It should be very clear to him now that people loathe rapists, and a large majority had to get their anguish of off their chest, even if it meant laughing at his narcissism, sickness and foolishness.' Following the backlash Cosby's original tweet was deleted and the meme generator was removed from the site. The link now redirects people to Cosby's homepage. However the memes have been widely repeated on other sites and social networking.

Last month, stand-up comedian and former Saturday Night Live writer Hannibal Buress unleashed a violent tirade about Cosby, calling him a 'rapist' and a sanctimonious hypocrite during a live performance. 'Bill Cosby has the f***ing smuggest old black man public persona that I hate,' Buress declared from the stage at the Trocadero Theater in Cosby's hometown of Philadelphia. Buress said: '''Pull your pants up, black people. I was on TV in the '80s. I can talk down to you because I had a successful sitcom.' Yeah, but you raped women, Bill Cosby.

Things changed however when one night she passed out after a glass of wine and woke up vomiting in the toilet wearing Cosby's white t-shirt. Bowman is certain that she had been drugged by Cosby. And she believes raped by him too. After that her relationship with Cosby changed, and by 19 he had sent her on her way after a final night in Atlantic City where she claims he tried to rape her. In 2006, Cosby settled a civil lawsuit with Andrea Constand, 32, a former Temple University employee who claimed Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in his Philadelphia mansion in 2004. It was at that trial that 13 women came forward to allege they too were drugged and sexually abused by Cosby. Cosby has not commented on any of the allegations since they have resurfaced.

"Police in the Oregon coastal town of Lincoln City say a nine-year-old girl trapped when a sand hole collapsed on her has died. Lieutenant Jerry Palmer says police and firefighters responded shortly after 5pm Friday and found a group of people trying to dig out the girl, identified as Isabel Grace Franks. Palmer says officers helped extract Franks from a large hole. Collapse: Isabel Franks was inside the hole she and other children dug when it collapsed in on her . Police began CPR after Isabel was pulled free, unconscious and not breathing. North Lincoln Fire and Rescue and ambulance medical teams took over CPR and the girl was taken to a hospital, where she died. Palmer says family members were with Franks when the collapse occurred. She was not identified pending notification of other relatives. North Lincoln Fire spokesman Jim Kusz told The Oregonian that the girl and her family were visiting from Sandy, 28 miles southeast of Portland. Kusz told KOMO News that Isabel was buried for about five minutes. Witnesses said the girl and some other young children had dug the hole on the beach. She sat down in the hole just before 5pm and the sand caved in on her. Desperate: Onlookers tried to dig her out but the child was buried for approximately five minutes . Tribute: Mourners placed flowers and candles in the hole on the beach as part of a makeshift memorial . 'And we heard screaming,' Tracey Dudley who was staying at a nearby hotel, told KOMO News, 'and screaming coming from the beach. At first we thought, you know, it was just kids, but it was like screaming and screaming and screaming.' She called 911 and watched as people tried to dig the girl out, but sand kept falling straight back into the hole. 'It was heart-wrenching,' Dudley said. 'You could see that people were trying, and I don't even know what to say. It was awful.' The hole was filled and mourners placed flowers and candles in memorial to Isabel Franks.","Isabel Grace Franks, 9, has died after a sand hole collapsed in on her .

"Actively searching for directions, weather reports or even what to have for dinner is so last year. The future lies in apps that can read your mind and offer up this information automatically, with Google leading the way with its Now app. Technically Google Now doesn’t read a user’s mind, but it is capable of predicting what they will do next, before offering relevant help and information at each step without ever being asked. Emu's ¿machine learning¿ capabilities could provide Google Now (pictured) with added context and faster response times, across different devices. The acquistion was confirmed in a blog post on Wednesday, but details of the deal have not been revealed . The software in prediction apps is based on an algorithm that combines various snippets of information to form a prediction. In the case of personal-assistant apps, the software scans calendar entries to work out . where a user is, or should be. It combines this with location data, . taken from the phone or tablet’s GPS unit, as well as posts on social . networks, email information and more. It will then present the user with the help it thinks they need. For example, if a calendar on an Android phone contains a diary invite, Google Now will create a reminder. It will then check to see whether the . user is en route to the meeting and add directions to this reminder, or . work out how long it will take them to get there based on current . traffic. Elsewhere, as users pass bus stops, . prediction apps can show bus timetables, show the latest deals as . they enter a supermarket, or open a digital boarding pass as they approach an airport. It does this by using what’s called ‘predictive analysis’. Predictive analysis isn’t a new concept; financial services have used it for years to work out a person’s credit score and how likely they are pay back a loan, for example.

Huffman's team is already working to make Google more human and recent updates mean the software can now understand context and present only relevant information like a human would . The latest updates to Google Now are an extension of changes the tech giant recently made to its search algorithm. Now when you search Google it no longer just searches for individual keywords; it can now respond to questions and statements in the same way a human might, by looking at the whole query - even if it doesn't have an exact answer. For example, asking Google 'Tell me about impressionist artists' will show a list of artists but also now let you click to learn about the impressionist movement, browse individual artwork, or switch to abstract artists using filters. Called Hummingbird, the company claims it’s 'the most significant algorithm change' in years and will affect 90 per cent of searches. Users can now ask Google to compile playlists, compare items or find out facts about landmarks and the search giant will create context for each one. For example, if searching for information about Big Ben, the searcher only needs to say 'Big Ben' once; Google will know that if someone asks for trivia about the landmark, before asking for directions, that both questions relate to the same thing. When used with Google Now, a card will show these directions automatically as soon as they search for the landmark, as long as they are within relatively close distance. Back in 2012, researchers from Birmingham University created software that could successfully predict a person’s future locations with an error margin of just 60ft.

While mobile phone networks can already track where a handset is in 'real time', the scientists developed the algorithm to forecast our future movements. They compared data from one individual and their closest social network to predict a person’s future location based on places and areas visited in the past and the frequency of contact between those studied. Earlier this year, researchers from Microsoft and Google similarly developed software called Far Out that can learn a person’s routine by tracking them using GPS. It then uses this information to accurately guess their future locations and will adapts its predictions even if someone changes their job, relationship or moves house. And as every aspect of our lives are tracked and monitored, the software is set to become even more advanced.","Google Now uses ‘predictive analytics’ to guess what its users want .
It combines location data with calendar entries, emails and more to predict what a user will do next .
App then works out what help they need and offers it without being asked .
Google Now is just one of many apps using these predictive algorithms ."
