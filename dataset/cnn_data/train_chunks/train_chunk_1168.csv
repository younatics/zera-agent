"Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone has wished Diego Costa well at Chelsea and believes he can make a major influence on the Premier League. Chelsea have agreed a £32.5million deal for the Spanish international, with Jose Mourinho finally bagging the centre forward he had always wished for since his return to Stamford Bridge. Rubber-stamped: Chelsea have agreed a £32m move for the former Atletico Madrid striker . Disappointment: Costa was part of the Spain squad that bombed out of the World Cup in the group stages . And Simeone, whose side got to the Champions League final in Lisbon, losing 4-1 to Real Madrid after extra time, has nothing but good words for Costa. 'I wish him the very best at Chelsea,' he said. 'He can still keep growing. 'He's at an age where he can continue to improve so let's hope he can develop further. I'm sure he'll be a success. 'I'm always going to be thankful to the players that give all their best. He had excellent performances while he was with us.' Costa scored 36 goals in all competitions for Atletico last season, with the 25-year-old spending four years at the Vicente Calderon.

"Premier League clubs splashed out a whopping £220,800,000 on new strikers during last summer's transfer window, with mixed results to say the least. While some players have taken to life in England like ducks to water, finding the back of the net on a regular basis and immediately earning a place in the hearts of supporters, others haven't been quite so lucky. But with a huge disparity between the fees shelled out on new attacking talent, which acquisitions have been the best value so far? Diego Costa, pictured celebrating against Liverpool, was the most expensive striker signed last summer . Italian forward Graziano Pelle, pictured celebrating against Newcastle, has netted six league goals already . Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli (centre) is yet to find the back of the net after swapping AC Milan for Anfield . To decide, MailOnline Sport has done some calculations and worked out the cost of each top-flight goal scored by the forwards signed for cold, hard cash last summer. And with those who arrived on free transfers before the window slammed shut back on September 1 exempt, Crystal Palace's Fraizer Campbell has emerged as the best buy. The former Manchester United and Sunderland man moved to Selhurst Park from relegated Cardiff in late July for just £800,000 and has since scored three league goals. The 27-year-old netted in wins against Everton and Leicester before scoring in the Eagles' 2-1 home defeat by Chelsea, giving him an impressive cost-per-goal of just under £267,000 - the best return in the division. Crystal Palace's Fraizer Campbell has cost just under £267,000 per goal so far this season . Former Cardiff striker Campbell celebrates scoring in Palace's 3-2 win at Goodison Park in September . Samuel Eto'o (Everton) - 3 goals . Didier Drogba (Chelsea) - 1 goal . Bafetimbi Gomis (Swansea) - 1 goal . Mame Biram Diouf (Stoke) - 3 goals . Newcastle's Ayoze Perez has been hitting the headlines in recent weeks and, after costing Alan Pardew just £1.5million from Tenerife, sits second in our countdown. Three winning goals against Tottenham, Liverpool and West Brom mean the 21-year-old's strikes have cost £500,000 apiece so far - a figure which looks certain to reduce significantly as the season goes on. Completing the top three is West Ham's Diafra Sakho, who has managed six goals in his eight Premier League appearances since moving to Upton Park from Metz for £3.5m. The Senegalese forward has cost the Hammers £583,000 per goal after finding the back of the net in consecutive matches against Hull, Liverpool, Manchester United, QPR, Burnley and champions Manchester City. Newcastle's Ayoze Perez (left) and West Ham's Diafra Sakho have turned out to be two of the best bargains . Two of last summer's big-money transfers saw Alexis Sanchez and Diego Costa swap Spain for England for a combined cost of £62million. Chilean Sanchez has hit the ground running at Arsenal after leaving Barcelona, scoring eight top-flight goals in 10 appearances to begin paying back his £30million fee. Those strikes, the most recent of which came against Swansea last weekend, mean Sanchez has cost the Gunners £3.75m per goal, while £32m man Costa has set Chelsea back £3.2m for every strike after netting 10 goals in just nine games. Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez has paid back a large chunk of his £30m fee with eight goals this season . Costa became an instant hit at Chelsea after netting 10 goals in nine Premier League appearances . It's been a different story for Arsene Wenger's other attacking acquisition, with £16m forward Danny Welbeck having scored just twice in the Premier League. His cost of £8m per goal is the same as Loic Remy, who remained in west London with Jose Mourinho's side after deciding to leave QPR. Romelu Lukaku is another young striker with a hefty price-tag to contend with after leaving Chelsea to join Everton on a £28m permanent deal following a successful loan spell last term. The 21-year-old Belgian has managed four goals under Roberto Martinez this season, making him one of the more costly summer additions at £7m a goal so far. Romelu Lukaku (left) and Danny Welbeck have proved to be two of the costliest strikers so far this season . The former Anderlecht youngster has still fared considerably better than Brendan Rodgers' summer signings across Stanley Park though, with Rickie Lambert and Mario Balotelli yet to find the back of the net in the league. Balotelli, a £16m buy from AC Milan, has only managed to score in the Champions League against Ludogorets and in the Capital One Cup against Swansea while £4m Lambert has struggled to make his mark since leaving Southampton. There's better news for Saints fans, who have a new hero in £8m Italian frontman Graziano Pelle. The former Feyenoord striker has already hit six goals in his debut campaign, at a cost of £1.33m per strike. Southampton duo Pelle (left) and Shane Long have had mixed fortunes since joining Saints last summer . Manager Ronald Koeman also splashed out £12m on Hull's Shane Long but the Republic of Ireland international is only just starting to find his form. His brace against Leicester last weekend means he has cost a substantial £6m a goal during his brief spell in red and white. Manchester United opted to pursue a late loan deal for Monaco's prolific striker Radamel Falcao, eventually bringing the Colombian to Old Trafford on a temporary deal for the season. But it's not happened for the former Atletico Madrid star in Manchester, with his £6m loan fee paying for just a single goal - the winner against Everton at Old Trafford last month.

"New York Knicks took advantage of a nervous LeBron James on Thursday night to beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 95-90 at the Quicken Loans Arena. NBA's four-time Most Valuable Player returned to the Cavaliers, his hometown team, in the summer after four years with the Miami Heat but wasn't at his best in their opening Eastern Conference game. James notched 17 points but couldn't prevent the Knicks - who had started sluggishly - from eventually clinching victory. VIDEO Scroll down to watch LeBron opener ends in defeat .

Introduced to a deafening roar from Cleveland fans, James was welcomed back  by a city desperate to end a championship drought that's about to turn 50 years old. James' journey is underway. At 8:08pm all was right in Cleveland again. That when James, the last starter announced, walked onto the floor in a Cavs uniform for a regular season game for the first time in four years. Nearly four months since proclaiming, 'I'm coming home' and shifting the NBA's balance of power, James is again playing in front of family, friends and the Cleveland fans who had their hearts broken when he left for Miami. In the pre-match huddle, LeBron was heard repeating 'this is special,' as he prepared to make his emotional return for the Cavaliers . Usher, part-owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers, performs the national anthem before the NBA game at the Quicken Loans Arena . This was a homecoming like no other. 'None of us should take this moment for granted,' a relaxed James said following Cleveland's morning shootaround at Quicken Loans Arena. 'This is probably one of the biggest sporting events ever. I don't feel it, but I know it is.' A crowd of 20,000-plus fans - with some paying as much as £3,125 ($5,000) for a ticket - packed the Q, which was updated during the off-season with a gigantic, fire-spewing scoreboard to welcome home Akron native James. Unfortunately for Cleveland, the night's best moments came before the game, as James played poorly and the Cavs were beaten by five points. James had eight turnovers, missed 10 shots and was not in sync with his new team-mates. 'I'm glad it's over,' James said. VIDEO LeBron opener ends in defeat .

Before taking the floor, James huddled his team-mates in a hallway and told them that 'tonight is special.' He then gave a playful tap to owner Dan Gilbert's son, Nick, before walking onto the court that was his for seven seasons. The pregame festivities ended with James going to midcourt and performing his 'chalk toss' pregame ritual with fans tossing paper confetti along with him. James, who has won NBA titles and Olympic gold medals, knew this season opener was a little more special. 'I understand how much I mean to this team, to this franchise, to this city and to this state,' he said. 'It's a different feeling, but I'm still as calm and excited at the same time because it's the first game of the season.'

In the hours after his decision, some angry fans burned his jersey and others hurled rocks at a banner that would be removed a few days later. On Thursday, the new banner - showing James with his arms outstretched wearing a jersey with 'Cleveland' where his name would normally be stitched - drew fans who posed for photos the same way they did when he was here last.

As they filed past, Barry Harris, 55, of Cleveland, was filled with pride. A lifelong Clevelander, he had never seen his city acting quite like this. 'It's amazing,' Harris said as his twin brother, Larry, snapped pictures of ESPN's SportsCenter set. 'I've been waiting 55 years for this. We got LeBron. We got Johnny (Manziel) Football. We got the Republican National convention coming in two years. We got casinos. It's huge. We deserve this.' James' return has Cleveland fans believing their tortured run of sports misery, which includes a series of close calls with nicknames like The Drive, The Fumble and The Shot, could be over.

'It's a different feeling, but I'm still as calm and excited at the same time because it's the first game of the season.' As James spoke with reporters, a 10-story-tall Nike banner with his likeness was being readied for an unveiling in the hours leading up to tip-off. James  brought back his signature pregame chalk toss for the game, a decision he made after conducting a poll for his followers on Twitter . On Wednesday, Cavs owner Dan Gilbert said James' impact on the area is immeasurable - economically and emotionally. It's created new jobs and other growth, giving the city a substantial shot in the arm as it undergoes an urban renaissance. Beyond that, James has renewed hope that Cleveland can help generations of Clevelanders forget well-documented, nicknamed misery: The Drive, The Fumble, The Shot, The Move, and, of course, The Decision. 'For us, the thing that drives us the most is delivering this for the fans of Cleveland,' Gilbert said. 'It will be 51 years, and that's what the emotion is really about that.'","NBA star LeBron James made an emotional return for his old franchise .

"The best city in the world for having fun is Berlin - which also serves the cheapest beer, according to a new survey. Statistics revealed the German capital was the top city for young people, while London came in second, Paris third and New York fourth. Twenty-five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the city is now considered the best city in the world to visit for a good time. In research that judged 1,800 cities on quality of restaurants, bars, adult entertainment, museums and shopping, as well as cost of a beer and time of last orders, the UK capital was deemed to have the best clubbing and concerts. Young travellers in particular favour travelling to Berlin for its nightlife, with the city ranking top for the price of beer served and winning out overall in terms of 'fun' City of fun: Berlin has been deemed the top city for fun, according to new research . While Berlin was applauded for having no 'last call' time and the lowest price of beer, it didn't win any other categories. GetYourGuide analysed reviews on 17 different websites including TripAdvisor, Yelp and Time Out to compile ‘The Ultimate Fun City Ranking’. Paris came in at number three on the list, despite not leading in any of the categories. Best clubs and concerts: London ranked second, according to reviews across 17 websites . New York, in fourth position, was considered best for activities, while Tokyo, ranked the fifth most fun, has the best bars and shopping. GetYourGuide CEO Johannes Reck said: ‘The research pulled out answers that were both expected and unexpected. We all thought either London or New York would come top of the shopping category; however they were beaten by Tokyo. 'The research also captured what a great, all-rounded city London is.

"Southampton have opened contract talks with midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin in an attempt to keep him on the south coast beyond the end of the season. Schneiderlin intimated in an interview in France on Tuesday that he could leave St Mary’s at the end of the season if they fail to qualify for the Champions League. The deal, which was put to the last week, is under consideration, but the 25-year-old wants various clauses inserted into the new contract.

"The radical Orion spacecraft, designed to carry astronauts into deep space, has arrived at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. Engineers are now preparing Orion to launch atop 180ft tall (55 metres) United Launch Alliance Delta 4 Heavy rockets in an unmanned test flight on December 4th. The spacecraft is hoped to take astronauts to explore an asteroid and eventually make the 34 million mile (55 million km) journey to Mars. Scroll down for video . The countdown begins: The Orion craft, designed to carry astronauts into deep space, has arrived Cape Canaveral Air Station in Florida . 'This is just the first of what will be a long line of exploration missions beyond low Earth orbit,' said Bill Hill, deputy associate administrator for Exploration Systems Development. 'In a few years we will be sending our astronauts to destinations humans have never experienced. It's thrilling to be a part of the journey now, at the beginning.' During the trip to Cape Canaveral from Nasa's Kennedy Space Center, the conical-shaped capsule was encased in its 52ft-tall (16 metre) protective fairing. The entire transported stack - which includes the fairing,  crew module and ‘Launch Abort System’ - is 70ft tall (21 metres) in total, or about the size of five double decker buses. When attached to the rockets, it will be around 250ft (76 metres). Last month the Delta IV Heavy rocket, built by United Launch Alliance, made its move to nearby Space Launch Complex 37 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Deep space: The spacecraft is hoped to take astronauts to explore an asteroid and eventually make the 34 million mile (55 million km) to Mars . Safety checks: During the four-hour mission, engineers will evaluate the systems critical to crew safety such as the launch abort system . The Launch Abort System and upper stage, shown in the left of this image, have been transported to Cape Canaveral. Here, they will be joined with the Delta IV Heavy Rocket ahead of a test flight in December. The right image shows the stages Orion will go through during flight . During its December 4 test flight, the unmanned capsule will shoot more than 3,600 miles (5,790km) into space. It will then take two big laps around Earth before re-entering the atmosphere at 20,000 mph (32,200 km/h) and parachuting into the Pacific off the San Diego coast. During the two-orbit, four-hour mission, engineers will evaluate the systems critical to crew safety, the launch abort system, the heat shield and the parachute system. The data gathered during the mission will influence design decisions and validate existing computer models. The flight also will reduce overall mission risks and costs for later Orion flights. The capsule will re-enter Earth's atmosphere generating temperatures as high as 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit, before splashing down in the Pacific Ocean. The rocket's three Common Booster Cores were tested, processed and attached to each other to form the first stage that will connect to Orion's service module. It then was raised last week from the horizontal position into its vertical launch configuration. For Orion's dry run, the Lockheed Martin-built capsule will have hunks of aluminium in place of seats for ballast, and simulators instead of actual cockpit displays. The Orion capsule is topped by a Launch Abort System that would life astronauts to safety during an emergency during a manned mission. During its December launch, Orion will complete two orbits of Earth at an altitude of 3,600 miles (5,790 km) over 4.5 hours, during which ground control will test the spacecraft's systems. Test flight: Orion will make two big laps around Earth before re-entering the atmosphere at 20,000 mph (32,200 km/h). Pictured is an artist's impression of the Orion craft in orbit . Ready for launch: Kennedy Space Center director Bob Cabana, far left, answers a question during a news conference prior to the rollout of the Orion Spacecraft as participants, second from left, Ellen Ochoa, Johnson Space Center director, Mark Geyer, Orion Program manager and Mike Hawes, director of Human Space Flight Programs at Lockheed Martin listen . The mission involves astronauts making the journey to their captive space rock by hitching a ride on the next-generation Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle. After the Orion and the asteroid are attached, the astronauts take a spacewalk to the captured object. Once the Orion docks with the remote-operated asteroid capture device, the crew performs a spacewalk that sees them climb almost the length of the conjoined vehicles to an exposed section of the asteroid they take photos of and scoop samples from, the video shows. After the mission is complete, Orion returns to Earth on the same path it journeyed out on, loops around the moon included, and splashes down in an ocean - likely the Pacific - 10 days later. The mission is seen as an important step towards sending humans to Mars. During its December 4 test flight, the unmanned capsule will shoot more than 3,600 miles (5,790km) into space. It will then take two big laps around Earth before re-entering the atmosphere at 20,000 mph (32,200 km/h) and parachuting into the Pacific off the San Diego coast. During the two-orbit, four-hour mission, engineers will evaluate the systems critical to crew safety, the launch abort system, the heat shield and the parachute system. The data gathered during the mission will influence design decisions and validate existing computer models. The spacecraft will also pass through the Van Allen radiation belts - two concentric rings encircling the Earth and held in place by a magnetic field. Since the Van Allen belts were first discovered in 1958, astronomers have been trying to trace the source of the super-acceleration. The acceleration is so high that satellites have to protect their sensitive components with shielding if their orbit spends significant time in the belts . The Orion capsule has been outfitted with sensors to take new readings on the belt and ensure that it doesn't interfere with any of the capsule's onboard electronics. Orion will re-enter Earth's atmosphere at almost 20,000mph (32,180 km/h), and reach temperatures near 2,200°C (4,000°F). At this stage, its parachute system will deploy to slow the spacecraft for a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean. Orion has its roots in the post-Columbia shuttle era; it originated a decade ago as a crew exploration vehicle to get astronauts beyond low Earth orbit and managed to survive the cancellation of the Constellation moon project. On future missions, Orion will carry astronauts farther into the solar system than ever before, including to an asteroid, and Mars. Four hour mission: Orion (artist's impression pictured) will reach temperatures near 2,200°C (4,000°F) during its test flight in December . Big move: The Orion capsule is shown here being moved from the Launch Abort System Facility at Kennedy Space Center, last night .

"Nick Clegg was embroiled in a fresh ‘cash-for-honours’ row last night after the extent of the party’s financial dependence on millionaire backers who have been made peers became apparent. Of all cash donations to the party in 2012, more than £600,000 – or 40 per cent – came from just three wealthy supporters – and all three have recently been appointed to the House of Lords by Mr Clegg, a Daily Mail investigation found. They are among 34 Lib Dems who have been given life peerages by Mr Clegg since the 2010 election – compared with an average of only four a year between 1997 and 2009. Wealthy: The three businessmen who are the Lib Dems' biggest donors have been given seats in the Lords . This is despite Mr Clegg’s complaints that the House of Lords is undemocratic and should be fully elected to stop politicians stuffing it with cronies. The Deputy Prime Minister is understood to be planning to give several more peerages to Lib Dem politicians who were kicked out by voters in the recent European and local elections. Mr Clegg is facing awkward questions over alleged cash for honours after senior Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott quit the party last month complaining he had failed to ‘expose and end cash for peerages in all parties, including our own’. Scotland Yard has been urged by SNP MP Angus MacNeil, who sparked the cash-for-honours scandal that engulfed Tony Blair’s government, to investigate whether any honours were sold in return for donations. Awkward questions: Nick Clegg has insisted the House of Lords should be more democratic . He said: ‘Lord Oakeshott’s comments are bigger than any admission that emerged through the last cash-for-honours investigation. We need full disclosure of which members of the Lords he is talking about, and what they gave in return for a peerage.’ It is Lib Dem policy to back a fully-elected House of Lords. Mr Clegg says it is a ‘flawed institution’ with no democratic mandate, held up by an ‘unsustainable status quo’. But this has not stopped him using his power of patronage as Deputy PM to appoint dozens of Lib Dem life peers. Money problems have made the Lib Dems even more reliant on their richest benefactors. The party was £713,000 in debt at the start of this year. Membership is falling and since forming the Coalition they no longer qualify for nearly £2million a year in public funding for opposition parties. They have become dependent on money from a small coterie of businessmen who have been given prestigious positions in the Lords, an analysis of party accounts and Electoral Commission figures shows. Mr Clegg made clothing magnate Raj Loomba, 70, a peer in November 2010, and appointed nightclub impresario James Palumbo, 51, and Domino’s Pizza tycoon Rumi Verjee, 56, to the Lords last August. The three men gave the Lib Dems £605,000 in 2012, representing 40 per cent of the total cash donations of £1,494,274 received that year. Lord Loomba and Lord Verjee – the latter via his firm Brompton Capital – were jointly the largest single donors, each giving £250,000. Lord Palumbo’s Ministry of Sound provided £105,000. In 2011 they gave £408,642, making up just under 23 per cent of all cash donations. They donated the even larger total of £632,097 in 2013, although this cannot be compared to the party’s total income because full accounts for the year have not yet been released. Allegations: Senior Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott (pictured) quit the party last month complaining he had failed to 'expose and end cash for peerages in all parties, including our own' These figures represent only part of the total amount given to the party’s central office, individual MPs and local constituency organisations by the recently-ennobled millionaires and their families over the years. Lord Palumbo has donated £1,004,757 to the Lib Dems, Lord Verjee has provided £1,156,326 and Lord Loomba has handed over £361,597, with nearly all of his donations coming since he was appointed to the Lords. 'I’m not saying it’s as crude as saying, “You give us £100,000 and we will put your name forward for a life peerage”, but I bet there’s a few nods and winks' Sir Alistair Graham, ex-chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life . Lib Dem donor turned peer Paul Strasburger, 67, has along with his wife given the party £870,613 since 2005. Sudhir Choudhrie, 64, whose family has donated £1,572,492 to the Lib Dems since 2004, was put forward for a peerage last year but was reportedly passed over amid concerns at that time about hospitals and care homes run by his family firm. The Lib Dems ran a deficit every year from 2008 to 2012, while membership slumped 35 per cent in two years to stand at just over 42,000 in 2012. Donors are not banned from becoming peers, but they are vetted by the House of Lords Appointments Commission, which rules on ‘whether or not the individual could have been a credible nominee if he or she had made no financial contribution’. However, it is a crime to sell peerages. Sir Alistair Graham, ex-chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said: ‘All parties, but particularly the Liberal Democrats and to a lesser extent Labour, are so dependent on these big donors that they will go to considerable lengths to attract them. I’m not saying it’s as crude as saying, “You give us £100,000 and we will put your name forward for a life peerage”, but I bet there’s a few nods and winks.’ The Lib Dems and all the Lords in question deny suggestions that their peerages were given in return for donations.","More than £600,000 of cash donations in 2012 from three wealthy men .

"Fraser Hobday, pictured, asked his sister to post his entire career and life story online - right from his early days at primary school. A footballer playing for a team languishing at the bottom of a Scottish semi-professional league scored an own goal - by giving himself a Wikipedia entry almost as big as a Premier League star. Cafe worker Fraser Hobday who plays in goal for lowly Huntly FC who are currently bottom of their division with a goal difference of minus 33. But despite his modest achievements the 19-year-old asked his sister to post a rundown of his career and life story online - right from his early days at primary school. The trainee chef's 3,271-word biography tells how he failed to keep any clean sheets at his first senior club. He then describes how he faced the pressure of a penalty in his first big game for Huntly FC, who play in the Scottish Highland League - and let in the goal. The career of Joe Hart, the Manchester City and England goalkeeper, who has won two Premier League title is described on Wikipedia in 200 words less.

'He was picked at the first time of asking, when the school held trials for Primaries 5, 6 and 7,' it says. The entry describes the time he won 'most improved player' in the under 13s category while playing for Stonehaven Youth FC. Describing one game during his career at Huntly FC, the entry said: 'Around the 30th minute of the game, and already 3-2 down, a sudden rush of blood to the head saw Huntly FC second choice goalkeeper Shaun Barney sent off for violent conduct. 'The team were forced into making a substitution, sacrificing defensive midfielder Mark Gray, and putting on the young trialist Hobday. 'His first responsibility was to stop a penalty and the pressure was on. Unfortunately, Hobday didn't save the penalty and Turriff United FC went on to win the game 7-3'.

"Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny is on the verge of being dropped as Poland’s No 1 goalkeeper after being relegated to the bench by his club. Poland manager Adam Nawalka has visited England to watch Bournemouth goalkeeper Artur Boruc play and was on a scouting mission at their 2-0 win against Watford less than two weeks ago. Nawalka met Boruc, who is on loan from Southampton, before that match and told him Szczesny’s place in the national team is up for grabs while he is on the bench at Arsenal. Wojciech Szczesny is facing the prospect of being second choice goalkeeper for both Arsenal and Poland . Szczesny was dropped after a series of poor performances was compounded by the smoking incident . Szczesny has fallen behind David Ospina after a host of errors and then angering Arsene Wenger for smoking in the showers after their 2-0 defeat to Southampton at St Mary’s. Ospina has begun to make Arsenal’s No 1 spot his own with a string of strong displays, conceding just three goals in six games - including four clean sheets - since replacing Szczesny at the beginning of January. Since that match against Southampton Szczesny has played just once, in their FA Cup win against Brighton when he conceded two goals. Colombian goalkeeper David Ospina, who joined from Nice in the summer, has taken his place at Arsenal . Ospina has conceded just three goals in his last six starts, and has kept four clean sheets for the Gunners . Boruc has won 59 caps for Poland but fell behind Szczesny, who has 22 caps, when he became Arsenal’s first-choice goalkeeper. The 34-year-old is determined to win his place back in the national side, as players who reach 60 caps go into a Polish half of fame. Boruc decided on the loan move further along the south coast after falling out of favour at Southampton when they signed Fraser Forster for £10m from Celtic. Before that he was their regular goalkeeper since moving to the club from Fiorentina in 2012. Bournemouth goalkeeper Artur Boruc is determined to win his place back as Poland's No 1 stopper .

"They stand out wherever they go and now India's tallest family is hoping to set a new world record with their combined height. The Kulkarnis, from the city of Pune in the east of the country, tower above their countrymen. Sharad Kulkarni, 52, stands at 7ft 1.5ins tall and his wife Sanjot, 46, is 6ft 2.6ins tall. Their daughters Mruga, 22, and Sanya, 16, are 6ft 1ins and 6ft 4ins respectively. The family's combined height is a staggering 26ft. The Kulkarni family: Sharad (right) and his wife Sanjot (second left) and their daughters Sanya (left) and Mruga (right) stand a combined 26ft tall . Mr and Mrs Kulkarni  were crowned India’s tallest couple by their country’s Limca Book of Records after they married in 1989. They had hoped to be named the world's tallest couple by the Guinness Book of Records, until it emerged that Wayne and Laurie Hallquist, from Stockton, California, stand a combined inch taller at 13ft 4ins. Mr Kulkarni said: 'We were a little . disheartened. It’s nice to have recognition when you live your life . being so different. It ends up meaning something. But we’re excited . about new prospects.’ Growing up, Mr and Mrs Kulkarni  faced years of teasing and ridicule. When Mr Kulkarni  hit 7ft as a teenager he ploughed his energies into sports and ended up playing basketball for his country. But Mrs Kulkarni  struggled to go unrecognised and fit in in the remote Indian village where she lived. The pair began to accept early on in their teens that marriage one day might be difficult. Mrs Kulkarni . said: ‘It’s hard for a woman to be taller than a man in India. The man . is the more authoritative role so I would never want to marry a smaller . man and then him be ridiculed about his wife. 'It was a big possibility that I’d never marry really.’ Walking tall: Mruga (second from right) and her sister Sanya (right) tower above their friends . On the move: Mr Kulkarni travels around on a scooter because he is too tall to use public transport comfortably . But Mrs Kulkarni’s grandmother spotted Mr Kulkarni walking down a street in Mumbai one evening and approached him. Mr Kulkarni said: ‘This older lady came up to me and asked if I was married or single and would I meet her granddaughter who was over 6ft. 'I didn’t believe her at first so I refused but my friends persuaded me to take her number.’ A few weeks later Mr Kulkarni’s parents called the number and a meeting was arranged for the potential couple, as is traditional in India. Mr Kulkarni, . who works at a bank, said: ‘Many women have claimed they’re 6ft but . then, when we meet they’re only about 5ft 10ins and too small for me. ‘But when I met Sanjot I was happy she was well over 6ft. I knew we’d be happy together.’ The couple married in December 1988. A year later Limca Book of Records pronounced them India’s tallest married couple. India's tallest couple: Mr Kulkarni stands at 7ft 1.5in and his wife Sanjot at 6ft 2.6in . Now, along with their two grown-up daughters Mruga and Sanya, they hope to have the chance to be the world’s tallest family. Mruga said: ‘I’m so excited. We love being tall. 'So many people would love to be taller. I hear girls moan every day about their short height but we’re so happy and content.’2 . Both Mruga and Sanya want to be models and hope that their height could give them a huge advantage in the industry. Mruga . said: ‘At the moment we’re studying and working hard on our exams but . we’re trying to apply to model agencies and build up a portfolio. 'We hope our height helps us get a long career in modelling. Husbands are a long way away yet.’ The Kulkarnis . have wardrobes full of custom-made clothes and shoes. Shopping on the . high street is impossible. Their shoe sizes range from 8 to 12 and they . often order their footwear online from Europe. Both Sanya and Mruga want to be models and hope that their height could give them a huge advantage in the industry . Their house has been adapted to meet their needs - they had to change all the door frames from 6ft to 8ft high. They have customised their furniture including beds, wardrobes, kitchen shelves, and even the height of the toilet. But . they never use public transport, preferring to travel on scooters. When . flying is necessary, they ask for a front seat or emergency exit row. Mruga . said: ‘It’d be easier if we lived in Europe and lived around European . open-mindedness. India can be very narrow-minded. But I wouldn’t change a . thing.’ Guinness Book of Records does not currently have a tallest family category but would consider it. Spokesman . Anne-Lise Rouse said: ‘We do monitor this category so we’d like to know . of any family that could potentially set this record and we’d then . advise them.’","Family is so tall they never use public transport and ride scooters instead .

'What an amazing way to celebrate veterans on Veterans Day,' said Jack Black, one of the concert's hosts. While tickets were free, the celebrity hosts directed fans to ways they can volunteer or donate money to causes helping war veterans. Some in the audience said the gesture had symbolic importance. 'This is the first time since I've been back that I've felt honored to be back home, and I'm 65 years old,' said Bobby Monk, a disabled Vietnam veteran from Washington who wore a gray Army T-shirt. 'They treated us like criminals when we came back home. They didn't give us a parade.'

The concert was televised live by HBO, which made its signal available to non-subscribers. Online streaming was also available. HBO chief executive Richard Plepler said it was possible that the concert could become an annual event. Schultz said he hoped the concert would help more Americans recognize the importance of welcoming post-9/11 veterans back to civilian life. 'Veterans Day comes once a year.

Since 1992, the Premier League has been blessed with the best, from homegrown talents Alan Shearer and Andy Cole, to foreign imports Tony Yeboah and Thierry Henry. In this international week, we are begging for goals, and these lot put the ball in the back of the net and make it look easy.

Emile Heskey (Leicester City, Liverpool, Birmingham City, Wigan Athletic, Aston Villa) Heskey may have sadly become a figure of ridicule in his later career but you can't question his goal record. The powerful frontman notched 110 in the Premier League, the majority coming in his time with Leicester City and Liverpool. His finest hour came in the 2000-01 campaign, when 22 goals in 56 matches for Liverpool helped them to a treble of FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup.

Heskey celebrates with Steven Gerrard after scoring during Liverpool's 4-0 victory over Leeds at Elland Road in February 2002 . 29. Robbie Keane (Coventry City, Leeds United, Tottenham, Liverpool, West Ham, Aston Villa) Goal machine Keane scored 194 times while a player in England, the majority of them in the Premier League. He first impressed at Wolves and was sold for £6m to Coventry while still a teenager. Twelve league goals convinced Inter Milan to sign the Irishman but it was a short-lived stay and he went via Leeds United to Tottenham. It was here he scored the majority of his Premier League goals, reaching double figures in five successive campaigns and winning the club's Player of the Year award on three occasions. A £19m move to Liverpool proved unsuccessful and Keane returned to north London. He scored 126 Premier League goals in all. Robbie Keane, pictured scoring for Coventry against Aston Villa, soon moved to Inter Milan after scoring 12 goals for the Sky Blues . Keane soon became famed for his  somersault celebration - here he is after scoring for Tottenham at Man City in January 2006 . 28. Kevin Phillips (Sunderland, Southampton, Aston Villa, Birmingham, Crystal Palace) Phillips developed into a formidable striker when at Sunderland, powering them back into the Premier League in 1999 with 23 goals in 26 matches and then, continuing his fearsome 'little and large' partnership with Niall Quinn, was top scorer with 30 in 1999-00. Sunderland finished seventh on their return to the big time, with Phillips the star. In 2002, he scored a crucial last-day goal against Derby to secure their survival but moved to Southampton when they went down the following year. Phillips continued his rich vein of form for the Saints, scoring 22 goals in two seasons and later enjoyed prolific seasons for West Brom, Birmingham and Blackpool.

Chris Sutton (Norwich, Blackburn, Chelsea, Birmingham, Aston Villa) Few adapted as quickly to the new Premier League in 1992 as Sutton, powering Norwich to third spot and then adding 25 goals the following season. He became the most expensive player in English football when Blackburn bought him for £5m in 1994 but proved his worth by forming a deadly 'SAS' partnership with Alan Shearer as Rovers upset the odds to win the title. He scored 15 times and Shearer 34 during an unforgettable campaign. He never quite reached those heights again but was the league's joint-top scorer with 18 in 1997-98. Sutton flopped at Chelsea after Blackburn suffered relegation in 1999 but found his scoring touch again in Scotland with 86 goals for Celtic.

Sutton, pictured captaining Chelsea and holding off the challenge of Watford's Robert Page, moved to Stamford Bridge for £10million . 26. Jurgen Klinsmann (Tottenham Hotspur) Klinsmann's time in the Premier League may have been brief but, mein Gott, what an impact he made. The German was a figure of hate when he surprisingly turned up at Tottenham in 1994; he was perceived as a shameless diver and had been part of the team that left England heart-broken at the 1990 World Cup. But all was forgiven and forgotten as Klinsmann powered in 20 league goals for Spurs, some marked with a self-deprecating dive celebration. His second stint at White Hart Lane, in 1997-98, helped rescue them from relegation. Jurgen Klinmann performs a swallow dive after scoring for Tottenham on his debut against Sheffield Wednesday in August 1994 . Klinsmann only spent two seasons in the Premier League but made a huge impact playing upfront at White Hart Lane . 25. Fernando Torres (Liverpool, Chelsea) Let's put his measly return at Chelsea to one side - a £50m price tag having weighed a little too heavily on his shoulders - and remember the best of Fernando Torres at Liverpool. The Spanish star scored 65 league goals in 102 appearances for the Reds - some feat - and was worshipped like a God. He arrived from Atletico Madrid for £20m in 2007 and opened his account against Chelsea. Torres' league scoring totals at Anfield read 24, 14, 18 and nine. He was a man for the big occasions, too, scoring important goals against the likes of Chelsea and Manchester United, not to mention 12 goals in three Champions League seasons. Fernando Torres was worshipped like a God at Anfield - especially after scoring in Liverpool's 2-0 win over Man United in 2009 . Having moved to Chelsea for £50million, Torres struggled for form in west London and that price tag weighed heavily . 24. Paolo Di Canio (Sheffield Wednesday, West Ham, Charlton Athletic) We all know about Di Canio's volcanic temperament, but let's remember some of the glorious goals he scored during his time in England. The Italian arrived at Sheffield Wednesday for £4.2m and scored 14 goals in his debut season to become a real fans' favourite (that shove on referee Paul Alcock aside). He scored 48 league goals in his five seasons with West Ham, including the Goal of the Season in 1999-00 for a flying volley against Wimbledon, still one of the best seen in the Premier League era. After Manchester United made attempts to sign him in 2001, Di Canio suffered relegation in 2003 and went on to Charlton.

Di Canio caused outrage in 1998 after pushing referee Paul Alcock,  having seen red for Sheffield Wednesday against Arsenal . 23. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink (Leeds United, Chelsea, Middlesbrough, Charlton Athletic) Surely one of the bargains of the Premier League era, deadly Dutchman Hasselbaink was signed by George Graham at Leeds United for just £2m.  He would quickly repay that fee with 34 goals in two seasons before being being sold for £12m to Atletico Madrid. He returned to England with Chelsea just a year later for a club record £15m and again proved great value for money. His 23 goals in 2000-01 - including a memorable volley against Man United - made him the league's second highest scorer. In tandem with Eidur Gudjohnsen, he matched that the following season, helping Chelsea to the FA Cup final, too. Hasselbaink also went on to score 22 times for Middlesbrough in two years.

Robin van Persie (Arsenal, Manchester United) The Dutchman ranks as one of modern football's most prolific scorers and would have plundered more but for persistent injury problems. Nonetheless, he scored 96 in 194 league games for Arsenal between 2004 and 2012 including a glorious airborne volley against Charlton in 2006 that Arsene Wenger described as 'the goal of a lifetime.' His best season for Arsenal was his final one – with 30 in 38 – and convinced Man United to pay £22m for him. A 26-goal haul in his debut season earned RVP a coveted Premier League winner's medal.

Van Persie scores another incredible volley after latching on to Wayne Rooney's long ball during Manchester United's win over Aston Villa at Old Trafford in April 2013 as the Red Devils won the Premier League . 21. Nicolas Anelka (Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester City, Bolton Wanderers, Chelsea, West Brom) Sulky but often silky, controversial but consistent in his scoring, Nicolas Anelka was the striker who refused to say farewell to the Premier League. He made his breakthrough at Arsenal as a 17-year-old, helping them to their first 'Double' in 1998 and he was their top scorer the following season too before his first Grand Depart. After time at Real Madrid and a loan spell at Liverpool, Anelka's scoring ability persuaded Kevin Keegan to break Man City's transfer record - then a mere £13m - in 2002 and he scored 37 league goals for them. He spent two years at Bolton after a spell at Fenerbahce before moving to Chelsea for £15m, helping them to a Premier League title and two FA Cup triumphs.

"Sweetness: Bake Off star Ruby has a vulnerability that's won over Liz Jones . She wouldn’t look out of place as a kitchen maid on Downton Abbey as, with an etiolated elbow (Ruby’s limbs are like a set square), she nudges one of her tawny curls out of her eyes, as green as a cat’s. She’d fit in perfectly on the catwalk at Louis Vuitton, too, although the white powder often found on the end of a runway model’s nose doesn’t tend to be of the kind found on Ruby’s retroussé button: icing sugar, or self-raising flour. Ruby has done some modelling, but unlike the catwalk queens, her arms have muscle definition, from kneading dough. In fact, Ruby doesn’t knead dough in the way I’ve seen it done on food programmes before: she slings it at the bench despairingly, large eyes rolling at her own ineptitude. Because Ruby, rather than moaning ecstatically at her own creations in the manner of Hugh and Jamie and Nigella (can you imagine a writer doing the same? ‘Oh, that last sentence of mine was perfection!’), she has often, during the nine weeks of The Great British Bake Off, seemed about to waft off in her floral tea dress to find a convenient lake to drown herself in. I wonder she didn’t slope off to hang herself from the marquee’s guy ropes, the day her Charlotte Royale showed its innards. Despite the fact she has made it to the show’s final on Tuesday, despite her extravagant beauty, and brains that aren’t made of bavarois, Ruby Tandoh seems to have no self esteem whatsoever. Now that every young person has been brought up with the American attitude that we can all ‘be whatever we want to be’, Ruby is the mistress of a long lost British art of self deprecation. ‘It’s burnt,’ she wails, so the judges, Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood, have to console her, tell her that, no, it is not burnt, it is perfection. As are you. Scroll down for video . 'Perfection': The 21-year-old student is the 'mistress of a long lost British art of self depreciation', according to Liz Jones . Self-deprecation is so long lost, in fact, that critics and viewers think Ruby, a 21-year-old philosophy student from Essex, is protesting too much. That no one this beautiful could possibly be genuinely down in the mouth. ‘Like chocolate being prepared for a Black Forest topping, her false modesty is really beginning to grate,’ wrote Jan Moir in the Daily Mail. ‘You are c*** at baking,’ spat a viewer on Twitter. ‘Your opera cake was rubbish. Go back home E.T.’ (Ruby’s caramel skin comes from being a quarter Ghanaian). Ruby has developed such a habit of peering up from under that bird’s nest of hair, almost afraid to find out the verdict on her baking, that many women have tweeted that she is letting the feminist side down by being so coy. Many have accused her of flirting unashamedly with Hollywood, and that he in turn has given her Brownie points (literally, given her brownies points), which is nonsense. Actually, I am all in favour of Ruby being so down on herself. It is infinitely preferable, surely, to all those self-promoting third wave feminists who have self-belief oozing from every open pore, an oleaginous goo that makes them condemn any woman who is not like them, who doesn’t flaunt her fat thighs in cut-off denim shorts, who prefers perhaps to crouch before any door of opportunity, afraid of what lurks outside when she musters the strength to open it. This criticism of our Ruby beggars belief. Take it from someone who knows: Ruby’s self doubt is genuine. I love that, rather than kneel before her oven, watching her meringues harden,  you get the feeling she would rather  just shove her head inside, and for it all to be over. It has become a curiously British sport, to abuse a woman online simply for being quietly good at what she does (and Kimberley Wilson, too, her fellow contestant and closest rival in the final, gets abuse for being too cocky, for saying too often that she has ‘plenty of time’, and has done her best). Tearful: Ruby often breaks down in tears on the show and Liz Jones says the baker's self doubt is genuine and she is the 'poster girl' for the shy . Never mind who is crowned champion this week, it seems you really cannot win. But, fortunately for Ruby, it seems if you prod her skin with a forefinger, it springs back into shape. She has responded robustly, Rihanna fashion, to offending tweets. ‘The unfounded, unfiltered, lazy ranting of a bitter old witch,’ she typed in answer to one addled rant. She is determined only to focus ‘on the good bits’. Hollywood revealed in an interview last week that potential Bake Off contestants have to pass an examination with a psychologist before they are allowed to take part in the show, which is so successful it moves to BBC One next season. This is coming to something, isn’t it: that to compete in a TV show about making cakes requires a tin foil exterior to ward off all those negative vibes. The world, once you stick your head above the parapet, has become intolerable. After Ruby broke the glass bowl of her Magimix (does that date me, saying Magimix? Should I have typed Kitchen Aid? Will, now, the Twittersphere be alive with barbs about how old I am, how I should go back to the Seventies, perchance?), and wailed that she was so embarrassed she could not go on with her baking, a new hashtag instantaneously sprang up: hashtag middleclassproblems. (Sorry, I’ve no idea where the sign for hashtag is on my keyboard, as I do not tweet, as I am far too busy having, you know, a life.) Ah, so this is what women have been taking umbrage with: Ruby shouldn’t moan because she doesn’t have real problems, like mastitis, or a minimum wage job as a cleaner, or cancer. She has the use of all her limbs, and what gorgeous appendages they are, too. This derision of so-called middle class problems comes from the Janet Street-Porter school of thought: you know, that depression doesn’t exist, that it is all in the mind (!). Stick a metal skewer into Celebrity Masterchef finalist Janet and it would be damn sure to come out dry: see, I can do bitchy with the rest of them . So, on behalf of the nation’s shrinking violets, I hope it will be Ruby’s Tuesday. I hope she beats, too, fellow finalist Frances Quinn, who is too fiddly and inventive for my taste. Ruby has, after all, been Star Baker three times (she nearly fell off the stool every time), has odds of 2-1, and deserves to win for her poise, her blushes and her modesty as much as her opera cakes and wonky garden shed made from carrots, with a caramel roof that even Mary Berry had never come across before. Ruby deserves to win not for always giving it the inevitable 110 per cent, but for winging it, for saying her filo pastry was ‘a lot better than what I usually knock up’. Ruby is the poster girl for the shy, the losers in life. Let’s hope winning doesn’t go to her lovely head.","Liz Jones hails Ruby Tandoh as the 'mistress of the art of self depreciation'

"Nemanja Matic and Branislav Ivanovic have stoked the fire ahead of Chelsea's clash with Liverpool on Saturday by mocking the Merseysiders for their reaction to losing at Anfield back in April. The match is regarded as the defeat that ultimately ended Liverpool's title challenge and after the game manager Brendan Rodgers quipped that Chelsea had 'parked two buses' in front of the goal.

"Chelsea players weren't prepared to work hard for Andre Villas-Boas, meaning his time in charge was always destined to be short-lived. The former Blues boss lasted nine months at Stamford Bridge amid dressing room spats and disappointing results. And, according to Ashley Cole, the squad who eventually went on to win the Champions League and FA Cup that season didn't play for the Portuguese.

"Humans remains of people killed 13,000 years ago in what scientists believe is the oldest identified race war, are today due to go on display at the British Museum in London. Two skeletons from a massacre in the Sahara desert in 11,000BC, which killed at least 26 people, will be shown in the new Ancient Egypt gallery, alongside the flint-tipped weapons with which they were killed. French scientists have been working with the museum to examine dozens of skeletons that were found grouped together in the Jebel Sahaba cemetery - one of the earliest organised burial grounds - on the east bank of the Nile, northern Sudan, in the 1960s. A pair of skeletons belonging to people who were killed on a massacre 13,000 years ago as the result of climate change, are going on show in the British Museum, London. Pencils pinpoint out pieces of weaponry responsible for their demise . The cemetery was discovered in 1965. It contained at least 61 individuals dating back about 13,000 years ago. The graveyard is one of the earliest formal cemeteries in the world. Prior to the discovery, only isolated graves, or clusters of up to three bodies had been known within the Nile Valley, experts at the British Museum write in a blog post. Out of the 61 skeletons found buried at the site, at least 45 per cent of them died from inflicted wounds. The remains are the earliest evidence for inter-communal violence in the archaeological record. Fragments of arrows and weapons were found alongside the bodies – with some weapons embedded in the bones. Cut marks were also found on the bones. They believe the remains of the 60 . individuals found - around half of which had cut marks on their bones - represent the . first communal violence between groups. Fighting probably broke out because . of the environmental disaster of the Ice Age, which caused the attackers and victims to live together in a smaller area, the experts explained. Renee Friedman, the museum's curator of early Egypt, told The Times that the attackers and victims were hunter-gatherers who usually avoided violence by moving on when a certain area became overcrowded. But she believed that the cold and dry conditions of the Nile valley around that time caused a 'population crisis', as more people moved to the same area surrounded by desert. She said: 'Things were probably very tight, so we think that people started picking on one another.' The museum acquired the remains in 2002 when they were donated by Fred Wendorf, an American archaeologist who excavated the site in the 1960s. At least 60 individuals were found and . examined using modern technology. One body was found with 39 pieces . of flint from arrows and other flint-tipped weapons, Dr Friedman said. French scientists have been working with The British Museum to examine dozens of skeletons that were found grouped together in the Jebel Sahaba cemetery. An image of excavations at Jebel Sahaba in 1965 is pictured . The cemetery was discovered in 1965. It contained at least 61 individuals dating back about 13,000 years ago. The graveyard (illustrated showing the position in which the skeletons were found,) is one of the earliest formal cemeteries in the world . They believe the remains of the 60 individuals found (a skull is pictured) represent the first communal violence between groups because almost half the remains have cut marks on them . Experts think that climate change sparked the violence. Ice Age glaciers covering much of Europe and North America at this time made the climate in Egypt and Sudan cold and arid, forcing people to live near the Nile. But the river was either wild or low and sluggish. There was little land on which people to live safely and resources were scarce. Competition for food may have been the reason for the violence as more groups of people had to stake a claim on the best fishing spots and sites to live. Two other cemeteries found nearby the main site suggest other social units, or small tribes, also considered the area their home and this may have caused friction. But the remains buried in the other graveyards show no signs of violence. So people buried in ‘Cemetery 117’ were either unlucky, or the resting place was chosen for people who dies of battle wounds. As well as the human remains, the display will include flint arrowhead . fragments and a healed forearm fracture, which was most likely sustained by a . victim who was trying to defend himself during conflict. Over the past two years, anthropologists from Bordeaux University have managed to find dozens of previously undetected conflict marks on the victims' bones. The British Museum scientists are now planning to research more about the victims themselves, including their gender, their age and their diet. Meanwhile, according to The Independent, work carried out at Liverpool John Moores University, the University of Alaska and New Orleans’ Tulane University suggests these humans were part of the general sub-Saharan originating population, who were ancestors of modern Black Africans. Dr. Daniel Antoine, a curator in the British Museum’s Ancient Egypt and Sudan Department, told the paper: 'The skeletal material is of great importance – not only because of the evidence for conflict, but also because the Jebel Sahaba cemetery is the oldest discovered in the Nile valley so far.' The cemetery where the remains were discovered in the 1960s is one of the earliest organised burial grounds in the world and lies on the east bank of the Nile, northern Sudan (marked) Human remains from the first known human massacre which scientists believe was carried out in 11,000BC during the Ice Age are due to go on display today for the first time at the British Museum in Londond .

"Prosecutors in southern New Mexico say a professional mixed martial artist won't be charged in a fatal stabbing of an intruder during a suspected home invasion at the fighter's home. The District Attorney's office in Las Cruces announced Thursday that a thorough investigation did not produce evidence to prove that Joseph Torrez killed 25-year-old Sal Garces on Jan. 1 without legal justification. The office says its conclusion was based on evidence turned up by the Dona Ana County Sheriff's Office, which didn't recommend prosecution of Torrez. Fighter: Joe Torrez allegedly killed an an intruder and fought off three others in a home invasion gone wrong . New Years: Torrez was home with his young son and fiance when the intruders burst into his home early New Years Day . Sheriff's officials say Torrez fatally beat and stabbed Garces, beat another intruder so badly he needed to be taken from Torrez's home in an ambulance and then convinced the other two to retreat in fear. Authorities found the body of Garces near Torrez's trailer home in the 600 block of King James Avenue. Garces, his 19-year-old brother Raymond Garces, 20-year-old Nathan Avalos and 22-year-old Leonard Calvillo forced their way into 27-year-old Torrez's house about 2 a.m. on New Year's day. Once inside the home, a fight began between the intruders and Torrez - a fight that ended with Garces dead, Avalos being admitted to a hospital with 'severe' facial injuries and the other two fleeing the scene. The younger Garces and Calvillo were arrested shortly after the altercation, while Avalos was taken into custody at the hospital. Gangster: Raymond Garces is a longtime criminal and known gang member, according to police . Threat: Leonard Calvillo threatened Torrez in a phone call before storming into his home with his three friends . What led to the fatal fight are unclear, but Raymond Garces told police the group had gone to Torrez's home after a previous altercation, according to court documents first obtained by Las Cruces Sun News. Court records claim that Torrez was in the home with his young son, fiance and friends when his fiance's sister arrived claiming to have been 'jumped.' Torrez then received a threatening call from Calvillo. 'I'm big Eastside,' Calvillo reportedly said, referring to a gang. '... I'll kill you and your family ... I will go to your house.' Each of the four intruders, authorities said, are known gang members. Shortly after the threatening phone call, the people inside heard a 'huge bang outside.' Within a matter of seconds the four intruders were in the house. Bad move: Sal Garces was found stabbed and beaten to death near Torrez's home . One of the men, a witness told police, was armed with a 'crude shank.' Another grabbed a knife after entering the home. An attorney for Torrez, C.J. McElhinney, says his client was acting in self-defense when he fought off the intruders. 'He was fighting for his life,' said McElhinney. After the fight, Raymond Garces and Calvillo fled, authorities said. Las Cruces police helped deputies locate and arrest them, according to a news release. Both men face several felony charges. Avalos has not been charged, but the case is still under investigation. Calvillo has been charged with aggravated battery, two counts of conspiracy and criminal damage to property. Raymond Garces was charged with two counts of conspiracy and criminal damage to . property. He was being held at the detention center on a $10,000 secured . bond. Authorities haven't ruled out charging Torrez with any crimes. A Facebook page has been setup in support of the MMA fighter.","The intruders were known gang members with lengthy criminal records .

"The Fox network isn't responding to suggestions that it edit its upcoming crossover episode of 'The Simpsons' and 'Family Guy' to remove a joke where the punch line is 'your sister's being raped.' The line appears in Sunday's much-awaited special where Bart Simpson and his family hang around with Stewie and the rest of the Family Guy crew, and has already circulated in a trailer for the episode that Fox released online over the summer. It punctuates a scene in which the incorrigible Bart is instructing Stewie Griffin in the art of the prank phone call. Bart dials the owner of Moe's Tavern and asks whether there is anyone there with the last name Keybum, first name Lee. When Moe calls out to his patrons, asking for a 'leaky bum,' everyone gets a laugh. Too offensive?: Critics are urging FOX to edit an upcoming 'Family Guy' and 'Simpsons' crossover episode in which Bart (left) instructs Stewie (right) on how to make a prank phone call and Stewie makes one about rape . Stewie thinks that's cool, and asks to make his own prank call. 'Hello, Moe?' he says. 'Your sister's being raped.' Tim Winter, president of the advocacy group Parents Television Council, said he's a longtime fan of Matt Groening, creator of 'The Simpsons,' and sought out the trailer when it was released. 'I was blown out of my shoes when I saw the scene with the rape joke in it,' Winter said. 'It really troubled me.' He said he found it particularly offensive in the context of stories about sexual assaults on college campuses and, most recently, talk about abusive treatment of women by some players in the National Football League. He said when rape is accepted as a punch line for a joke in entertainment, 'it becomes less outrageous in real life.' Winter said he wrote to Groening, 'Family Guy' creator Seth MacFarlane and Fox in August, asking that the joke be removed when the episode is shown on television. He said he received no reply. Fox's entertainment division, through a spokeswoman, said it would not comment on the criticism or whether there are any second thoughts about the joke. 'Family Guy' creator: Seth MacFarlane has been criticized in the past for writing jokes that offend 'sensitive groups of people' and has been forced not to air certain episodes . Katherine Hull Fliflet, spokeswoman for the Washington-based Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, said she did not find the line offensive. 'I think the show is making it clear that rape is not funny by how they are positioning the joke,' Fliflet said. 'It's my hope that would be the viewers' take-away.' RAINN, which says it is the nation's largest anti-sexual assault organization and operates a rape hotline, works with creators in Hollywood to help them depict sexual assault realistically. The group lists actress Christina Ricci as a national spokesperson. The National Organization for Women didn't respond to requests for comment on the Fox comedies. MacFarlane brought up the line during a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly, predicting he will get attacked for it in the media.'But in context,' he said, 'it's pretty funny.' Winter said he didn't think the subject was worth joking about, and said he was particularly concerned about its exposure to younger viewers who may be fans of 'The Simpsons,' but are not familiar with the 'Family Guy' style of comedy. 'We don't mock certain groups because we realize that it is highly insensitive and morally wrong,' he said. 'Why wouldn't we do the same thing about sexual assault?' 1. Fox declined to air an episode, 'Partial Terms of Endearment,' during the 2009-10 season when family matriarch Lois Griffin contemplates an abortion. She was acting as a surrogate for a couple killed in an auto accident before the baby was born. Fox executives said it was fragile subject matter at a sensitive time. The episode was later released on DVD. 2.The episode, 'When You Wish Upon a Weinstein' was criticized as anti-Semitic by The Forward, a newspaper that spotlights Jewish issues. In it, the character Peter sings a song titled 'I Need a Jew.' Fox initially declined to air it, and it was shown first on Adult Swim on the Cartoon Network in 2003. Fox then aired it the next year. 3. Advocates for AIDS patients criticized a 2005 episode in which Peter was part of a barbershop quartet that dressed in red vests and danced around a man's hospital bed singing a song titled, 'You Have AIDS.' 4.Sarah Palin called the show's writers 'heartless jerks' for a 2010 episode in which the character Chris dated a girl with Down syndrome. When Chris asked what her parents did, she replied: 'My dad's an accountant, and my mom is the former governor of Alaska.' Palin, who had resigned as Alaska governor months earlier, has a son with Down syndrome.","Critics say FOX should edit an upcoming 'Family Guy' and 'Simpsons' crossover episode with a joke punch line of 'your sister's being raped'

In his new autobiography, Luis Suarez: Crossing the Line - My Story, the forward reveals how Barca coach Enrique was incensed with the treatment he had received from FIFA.

His eventual return to training with Barcelona after his ban was changed on appeal  was described by head coach Luis Enrique (left) as 'like releasing a prisoner from Guantanamo Bay' Suarez kicks the ball as he is challenge by Sergi Roberto during his first Barca training session on August 15 . According to Suarez, Enrique compared his situation with that of a convict having been released from the US prison camp at Guantanamo Bay. Suarez writes: 'It wasn't the most orthodox of presentations to the rest of the squad either, the day I was finally allowed to train with the team. The front cover of the new autobiography, Luis Suarez: Crossing the Line - My Story . 'Barcelona's manager Luis Enrique gathered in the players and told them: ""Well, they have finally got him out of Guantanamo to be here with us today for training..."" 'Everyone applauded the released prisoner and I did my best not to look too embarrassed about being the centre of attention.' The severity of Suarez's ban led to a media frenzy which the striker believes almost derailed his £75million move from Liverpool to the Nou Camp in the summer. With the paparazzi following him everywhere, Suarez describes his transfer as a 'covert operation'. Three cars were utlilised in a slick, undercover plan to ensure Suarez was not spotted as he headed to Barcelona to sign his contract. 'Signing my new contract at Barcelona without it becoming public was a difficult operation too,' Suarez continues. 'The club had permission to sign me but it had to stay a private matter. 'There was a three-car plan in place with three different vehicles leaving the Nou Camp from three different exits in the event of us realising the press has been alerted. I had already got used to everything being a covert operation. 'Apart from all the things I couldn't be because of the FIFA ban, there was also a lot I couldn't do because of the attention that now followed my every move.'

"This is the moment a plane passenger filmed a 'UFO' speeding beneath his aircraft over Iran. The incredible footage shows a mysterious circular object moving at a steady pace through heavy clouds somewhere over the centre of the West Asian country. The shape and movement of the object suggests it could well be a drone - possibly operated by the Iranian military - although the clip has led to speculation that it may be an extraterrestrial craft. Close up: The incredible footage shows a mysterious circular object moving at a steady pace through heavy clouds somewhere over the centre of the West Asian country . Movement: The clip has led to speculation that the strange white object may be an extraterrestrial craft . The 34 second clip was filmed out the window of a passenger plane as it travelled over Iran. It shows a large white object flying several hundred feet below the aircraft, moving steadily through the clouds from right to left. Shaped like a disc, the fast-moving object does not resemble another plane, nor could it be mistaken for a helicopter. It also doesn't appear to have any of the markings or lighting systems other aircraft have. As it moves across the sky, the mysterious object appears to grow fuzzy around the edges before disappearing out of shot. Travelling: The 34 second clip shows a large white object flying several hundred feet below the aircraft, moving steadily through the clouds from right to left . Eerie: Footage of the mysterious object was filmed out the window of a passenger plane  over central Iran . Despite speculation that the object may be an alien craft, the most likely explanation is that it is high tech drone being operated by the Iranian military. Earlier this week Iran carried out the first test flight of a drone aircraft it copied from a U.S. craft captured in 2011. 'We promised that a model of RQ-170 would fly in the second half of the year, and this has happened. A film of the flight will be released soon,' Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh told the state-run IRNA agency. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also expressed content at the test flight, describing it as 'sweet and unforgettable' in a video published by the semi-official Tasnim news agency. Photographs of Iran's high-tech RQ-170 drone - which is white and disc-shaped - were first revealed in August.","Eerie footage shows mysterious circular object over West Asian nation .

"Don't pass the ball to Kobe. Nineteen years into his illustrious career, Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant finally entered the record books last night in the worst way possible when he broke the NBA record for most missed shots by a player. This as the Lakers fell to the Memphis Grizzles 107 - 102. Scroll down for video . One for the record books: Kobe Bryant (above) entered the record books for all the wrong reasons last night when he became the most missing shooter in NBA history . These were probably banked: Bryant has now missed 13,418 shots in his career . And while it was a bad night for Kobe, it was a very, very good night for former Boston Celtics forward John Havlicek who is now only the second worst shooter in the history of the game. To be fair, a look at the players who top the record board for this infamous honor includes the greats of the game, with Michael Jordan sixth on the list, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar fifth and Karl Malone fourth. Among the active players who could perhaps surpass Bryant are Vince Carter, Kevin Garnett and Dirk Nowitzki, who are all right outside the top ten. Bryant needed 13 misses heading in to last night's game to claim the record, and lucky number 13 came in the fourth quarter, pushing his lifetime total to 13,418 botched ball throws. Only the second worst: Bryant broke the record set by Boston Celtics forward John Havlicek (above) Airballs: Among active players, Kevin Garnett (left) and Vince Carter (right) have the best shot at being the worst shots and taking the record away from Kobe . On a much more positive note, Bryant  still remains the youngest player in league history to notch 30,000 career points, is the all time leading scoring in Lakers history, one of the game's most storied franchise, and has won the All-Star MVP a record four times. He also has two gold medals and has won the NBA championships five times with the Lakers. Off the court, Bryant is notoriously private and press shy, especially following accusations in 2003 that he raped a hotel employee at a Colorado spa. So in love: Bryant and his wife Vanessa, mother of his two children, Natalia and Gianna . The case was eventually dropped and a civil suit settled out of court. Bryant has been married to his wife Vanessa for 13 years, who scored a very nice and very expensive diamond apology ring following the aforementioned accusations said to be worth $4million, and the couple have two daughters, Natalia and Gianna.","Kobe Bryant set a record for the most missed shots in the history of the NBA last night when he banked the ball for the 13,418th time .

"A 16-year-old student who killed a classmate with a single punch during a school scrap has been cleared of criminal charges after surveillance footage showed the other teen picked the fight. Gregary Teer used justified force to defend himself when he punched 17-year-old Dakota Escritt at Abraham Lincoln High School in Council Bluffs, Nebraska on September 25, Pottawattamie County Attorney Matt Wilber concluded. Surveillance footage of the incident shows Escritt repeatedly pushing Teer in the school hallways after the boys reportedly exchanged words on social media the night before. Teer can be seen walking away from Escritt each time until he finally has enough and shoves back. Both boys raise their fists, but Teer hits first and the other boy falls to the ground. Scroll down for video . Fight: Gregary Teer, 16, (in the blue shorts) can be seen hitting Dakota Escritt, 17, who suffered a fatal injury when he smacked his head on the floor. Teer was justified in the force he used, investigators said . Down: Escritt was conscious for moments after he fell and can be seen on surveillance footage lifting his hand up in the air as Teer walks away. He was rushed to hospital but died three days later . Escritt smacks his head on the tile floor and lifts up one arm to the ceiling before falling back down. He was taken unconscious to a hospital, where he died three days later. An autopsy showed that his cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head, the Omaha World-Herald reported. 'There is no question in my mind that Escritt was the initial physical aggressor in this incident,' Wilber said at a press conference on Wednesday afternoon. 'In Iowa you are entitled to use reasonable force to defend yourself. This is not a case of deadly force being used', WOWT reported. No charges: Teer, pictured Wednesday, said he had no intention of killing his classmate. The county attorney agreed, saying Teer had been entitled to use force to defend himself after Escritt picked a fight with him . Killed: Escritt, pictured left and right, could be seen repeatedly pushing Teer before the deadly punch . He added that while Teer intended to throw the punch, he didn't intend for anyone to die. Teer, who spoke at his attorney's office on Wednesday, said he never meant to kill his classmate. 'I'm very sorry for what has happened,' he told reporters. 'I feel horrible. I didn't mean for any of this to happen. I don't think anybody did.' Teer is still suspended from school, which says he violated the school's code of conduct by engaging in a fight. It is not yet known which action the school will take - he could be expelled, moved to another school or be allowed to return to class - but his attorney argues he should be let back to the school. 'He's not a criminal,' Chad Primmer said. 'He responded legally.' Spat: Teer, pictured left and right, had exchanged words with Escritt on social media before the attack. The fight began when Teer collided with one of Escritt's friends during a ballgame the previous week . At the press conference, Wilber said that school records show that both boys had disrupted classes and been in fights, but never with each other before September 25. Escritt, who spent some of his younger years at a home for boys before being adopted by his paternal grandmother and step-grandfather, had exchanged words with Teer online before his death. A week before, Teer had collided with one of Escritt's friends, who had his arm in a cast, during a ballgame and the two boys argued, the Omaha World-Herald reported. That night, Escritt sent Teer a message on Facebook telling him to leave his friends alone, and Teer responded with a similarly foul-mouthed message, telling the teenager to mind his own business. Days later, Escritt was seen following Teer at school before pushing him, ultimately leading to the fatal shove. Remembered: Tributes can be seen for Dakota, who had spent some years in a boy's home before he was adopted by his grandmother. Friends wore black to school while he was fighting for his life in hospital . What next? Teer is currently suspended from Abraham Lincoln High School, pictured, but could be expelled or transferred or could be allowed to return to class. He says he legally did nothing wrong . The school became divided in the aftermath of the fight, the World-Herald reported. Escritt's friends decided to wear black to school while he was still in the hospital - and when Teer's friends caught wind of the plan, they decided to wear green. But some students bucked both ideas and wore red and blue for a 'Unity Day' to show that the student body had to come together during the tough time.

"Accusations: SNP MP Angus MacNeil contacted Scotland Yard after former Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott claimed the practice remained rife . Pressure increased on the Liberal Democrats last night as police confirmed they were reviewing claims party chiefs offered peerages to donors. Scotland Yard wrote to SNP MP Angus MacNeil to confirm it was ‘considering’ his letter urging police to look at the matter. He contacted the force after former Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott claimed the practice remained rife. The letter has been passed to Commander Graham McNulty, who was responsible for the cash-for-honours probe that engulfed Labour eight years ago. Mr MacNeil, who uncovered the 2006 cash-for-honours inquiry, said: ‘I’m glad these recent revelations are being given the attention they deserve. ‘While the Liberal Democrats concede the House of Lords is outdated and undemocratic they continue to stuff it with cronies. ‘The SNP’s long-standing position is that we believe those making laws should be elected by the people, and therefore we do not nominate members to the House of Lords.’ Lord Oakeshott, a close ally of Vince Cable, quit the Lib Dems last month after calling for Nick Clegg to be replaced as leader. In his resignation statement he said: ‘My efforts to expose and end cash for peerages in all parties, including our own, and help get the Lords elected, have failed.’ His comments prompted Mr MacNeil to write to Scotland Yard and urge investigators to return to the thorny issue once again. Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick replied to say that the letter has been passed to Mr McNulty in the force’s Specialist Crimes and Operations Directorate. The officer was in charge of the 2006 investigation which saw a sitting Prime Minister interviewed by police for the first time when Tony Blair was questioned as a witness. Three others, chief fundraiser Lord Levy, Downing Street aide Ruth Turner and Labour Party backer Sir Christopher Evans were arrested but never charged. Hints: Lord Oakeshott said his resignation statement that he had 'failed' in his efforts 'to expose and end cash for peerages in all parties, including our own' Mr MacNeil, MP for the Western Isles, is a fierce critic of the House of Lords and said the forthcoming vote on independence could rid people north of the border of its cost. He added: ‘If the rest of the UK want to keep funding the House of Lords, it is a matter for them. ‘A Yes vote would mean that people in Scotland could get rid of the expensive and unrepresentative Westminster tier – saving around £50m a year in not sending MPs and peers to London.’ Lib Dem funding has fallen sharply since they went into Government and the party has become increasingly reliant on big donations. Earlier this month it emerged how the party’s three biggest donors – who have provided two-fifths of all the party’s donations – have been given peerages by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. The three Lords – Ministry of Sound magnate James Palumbo, Domino’s Pizza founder Rumi Verjee and clothes tycoon Raj Loomba – donated around £600,000 between them. They are among 34 Lib Dems who have been given life peerages by Mr Clegg since the 2010 election – compared with an average of only four a year between 1997 and 2009. This is despite his complaints that the House of Lords is undemocratic and should be fully elected to stop politicians stuffing it with cronies. Earlier this month Mr Clegg denied that anything improper has taken place and insisted the claims are demeaning to wealthy donors. He said businessmen were ‘perfectly’ entitled to give the Lib Dems huge sums and it is unfair to suggest they should not then be made peers. Mr Clegg said he is ‘delighted’ that they have joined the ‘Lib Dem team’, adding: ‘They’ve got a huge amount of experience, a lot of business nous.’ A Lib Dem spokesman said: ‘It is completely untrue that Liberal Democrats engage in cash for peerages.’","Allegations Liberal Democrates have offered titles for party donations .

"Three in four British women would choose a man with love handles over one sporting a six-pack. That's 23 million of us who find muscular men a turn off; 96% predict a date with an abs-obsessed bloke to be positively dreary. These stats are the result of a study commissioned to mark the DVD release of Bad Neighbours, a film featuring numerous shirtless scenes of actors Seth Rogen (in the flab corner) and Zac Effron (in the abs). Scroll down for video . A recent study revealed that when it comes to body types, women prefer their man to have a little more to love . Let's be clear here: these results don't mean women won't be eyeing off Zac's 'V' line: the muscular line running from the hip bone to the groin. Did they audition chubby men for the highly anticipated film of Fifty Shades of Grey? I don't think so. We will ogle, we will fantasise. But when it comes to real life, we don't want chiselled perfection in our bed. The question is: why on earth not? Why don't women want some hot, buff, perfect-bodied man lying beside us? The sad answer is this: we're worried we won't shape up. Seventy-four percent of women in the survey said they'd feel self-conscious taking their clothes off in front of a perfectly toned man. A he-man's discipline highlights our lack of it, making us feel even more acutely self-conscious of our own body flaws than usual. Tracey says we avoid relationships with fitter men because we don't believe we can live up to their standards . We feel far more comfortable with flab because it's less threatening. Women are already under extreme pressure to look a certain way and be a certain weight. Anyone who ever doubted that women are judged by their physical appearance far more than men, need only have witnessed the media coverage of the unveiling of Cameron's female MP's: nearly all of it focused on what they wore and what they look like. It takes robust self-esteem and an unshakeable body image to stay objective about our weight in a society where the body ideal is so unachievable, even models struggle to maintain it. Is it any wonder women figure - usually quite rightly - that a man who is less critical of his own appearance and less looks-obsessed will be less critical of ours? Mr Non-Perfect is a relief to any woman who steps on the scales, every day of her life, and finds her mood is affected, every day of her life, by what they say. Especially when it comes to sex. I'd love to meet a female whose sex life isn't affected by a 'fat day'. I've yet to meet one man who has let feeling fat stop them having sex. Tracey says that when it comes to sex, women are far more concerned about weight than men . Michael Alvear, the author of 'Not tonight dear, I feel fat', says fifty percent of women admit they've put off sex - even when they're in the mood - because they felt too fat. 'Women put conditions on sex because of weight. You won't do it without cover-up clothing. You only have sex with the lights out. You'll only do positions that prevent your partner from looking at or touching certain parts of your body,' he says. 'Pretty soon your desire for any sex, conditional or not, goes away.' We don't just think our partners won't desire us unless we are thin. We don't feel desirable unless we are thin. There are many (many) things men can learn from women, but this is one area where women can learn from men. When men look in the mirror, they look at the parts of themselves that they like. I showed four male friends the publicity stills of the ab-tastic Zac Efron and they all shrugged and said, 'He looks good. But he's paid to look like that. That's his job.' They made no comparison to themselves. There was no subconscious sucking in of their beer belly. No wistful glance at their not-so-bulging biceps. When women look in the mirror, they hone in on the bits they don't like. Show us a picture of Cameron Diaz in a bikini and we think 'Why don't I look like that? I better not eat anything else for the rest of the day and hit the gym after work'. It's a continuing double standard that's not working for anyone - men or women. We should all be more Seth-like: learn to love our bellies and accept that wobbly bits are all part of being mere mortals.

"Lee Westwood has called on the European Tour to resist any temptation to mimic their American counterparts by overhauling the season’s finale. The Race to Dubai has become all but a procession for Rory McIlroy, whose lead is almost insurmountable heading into the penultimate event of the Tour at the Turkish Airlines Open this week. McIlroy’s lead of close to three million points is such that he is missing the event in Antalya, which starts on Thursday, and it would require at least wins here and in Dubai next week from any of Jamie Donaldson, Sergio Garcia or Marcel Siem for the Northern Irishman to not emerge with the title. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Turkish Airlines Open day 1 highlights as Jimenez cards 63 . Lee Westwood (left) and Sergio Garcia (right) are presented with a model aeroplane in Antalya . Westwood (left) and Garcia speak to the media during a press conference ahead of the Turkish Airlines Open . It is a far cry from the PGA Tour, whose four-tournament FedEx Cup series at the end of the season offers considerably more points than regular events, with the winner of the points-rich final event – the Tour Championship - going on to win the FedEx Cup in each of the past five seasons. Westwood believes that is a model the European Tour should not replicate too closely, even if it would make for a more exciting conclusion to the season. He said: ‘There's going to be flaws in it, whichever way you go. I'm a big fan of somebody showing consistency over the whole year and winning it. If you look at Rory's season, he's won two major championships, a World Golf Championships, and our flagship Event, the BMW PGA Championship, which is a phenomenal year. ‘If you put that up in somebody's career, those four tournaments, that would be a good career, and he's done that in six months, basically.

Garcia (left), Westwood (centre) and Henrik Stenson attempt to hit golf balls over the towering walls of the Amphitheater of Aspendos . A general view of the stunning 2,000 year-old Amphitheater of Aspendos during the challenge . ‘Occasionally somebody will do something extraordinary and deserves to win the money list. If you have it where it's all on the last event, we are getting into that area of copying the PGA TOUR and copying the FedEx. ‘People complain that it's a little too volatile at the end. I've looked over the last few years and it just seems that whoever wins THE TOUR Championship wins the FedExCup in the States. You can look at that one of two ways - that's not ideal sometimes. ‘I have no problems with it being over before the final event, especially this year with what Rory has done.’ Westwood, meanwhile, echoed his support for Darren Clarke’s bid to be Europe’s 2016 Ryder Cup captain. Westwood competes in this week's Turkish Airlines Open, the penultimate event of the European Tour . Westwood, who had backed Clarke for the role that ultimately went to Paul McGinley for this year’s event, said: ‘I think The European Tour is very lucky. It's got lots of good candidates, lots of former Ryder Cup players that have got experience of many different captains. ‘It's probably between Darren and Miguel Ángel Jimenez. Darren just edges it for me. There’s his record and also with it being in the States where Darren's got a good reputation. Not that Miguel hasn't, but Darren's won World Golf Championships over there and he's played the PGA Tour quite a bit and been a member of that Tour. ‘I backed Darren last time and Paul got it; and I was wrong - Paul was a great captain. I'd like to see Darren get it next time around and sit down with Paul and let Paul shoot a few ideas at him and feed off that momentum that Paul really built up as far as being the captain.’","Rory McIlroy has an almost insurmountable lead in the Race to Dubai .

'I think he needs to get the help he needs. I do not feel like, you know, he was a psychopath. I feel like he was a person who had just snapped.' Recalling the ordeal, Ms Shokat said Rogers saw her dive under her desk, and asked her to stand up, saying 'I'm not going to hurt you'. Ms Shokat started crying, worried that her life was in danger, but Shokat kept his word. While he held her captive for four hours, long after he released dozens of others, he did not harm her.

As the drama unfolded, Ms Shokat, 32, texted her family and friends and also interacted with her husband and co-workers. She also kept Rogers talking. They spoke about war and politics, but she backed off when he became agitated. Ms Shokat said: 'I think survival instinct kicks in,' Shokat said. 'I was just winging it, basically.' Shokat said Rogers negotiated his surrender using a phone provided by the police. With her assistance, he signed an agreement which allowed her to leave. Rogers was then taken into custody and will be charged in district court today.","Jennifer Shokat dived under her office desk after the gunman opened fire .

"A storm that ravaged a Danish island's coastline 5,000 years ago is said to have be responsible for a well-preserved set of ancient footprints. Archaeologists working on excavations of the Femern Belt Tunnel in Lolland found evidence of at least two people's prints, dating back to the Stone Age. And now experts believe they were left by fishermen attempting to protect nearby river barriers during poor weather. Using the size of the prints as a guide, experts from Lolland-Falster Museum believe the poor weather threatened the barriers, and the fishermen would have waded into the water to try to protect them. As each print was made, sand was pushed into the seabed and became preserved over time . 'It is quite surreal to have found human footprints,' said archaeologist Terje Stafseth in a press release. 'We normally find historical clues in the form of human waste, but here we have found an entirely different clue and a first in Danish archaeology: a physical print left behind by a human.' 'We know about animal footprints being found from the past, but human footprints have, as far as I know, never been found in Danish Stone Age archaeology.' The footprints were found running along a 3.2ft-long (one metre) system of fishing weirs used to feed a nearby Stone Age community. Their close proximity to these barriers, as well as their depth and position, suggest that a storm caused the barriers to flood and become covered in sand. Using the size of the prints as a guide, experts from Lolland-Falster Museum believe that the poor weather threatened the barriers, and the fishermen would have waded into the water to try to protect them. The footprints were found running along a 3.2ft-long (one metre) system of fishing weirs (pictured). Their close proximity to these barriers, as well as their depth and position, suggest that a storm caused the barriers to flood and become covered in sand . The well-preserved footprints, (pictured) were found during excavations on the Danish island of Lolland, and archaeologists believe they were made by fishermen trying to safeguard their weirs during a storm that hit the region and caused flooding, 5,000 years ago . As each print was made, sand was pushed into the seabed and became preserved over time. Preliminary dating of sediment and minerals in the sand suggest they were made during the the Stone Age. 'Studies have shown that Stone Age people repeatedly repaired and actually moved parts of the system to optimise the coastal flow. 'We can follow the footsteps and sense the importance of the [barrier] system, which has been an important element used to feed coastal populations,' continued Mr Stafseth. Archaeologists made the discovery during excavations of the Femern Belt Tunnel (marked) on the Danish island of Lolland. Excavations of the tunnel are continuing and Lolland-Falster Museum said it is hoping the prints will shed further light on the past following further tests . Excavations of the tunnel are continuing and Lolland-Falster Museum said it is hoping the prints will shed further light on the past, following further tests. 'With the discovery of footprints from Stone Age people, excavations in Rødbyhavn have suddenly become more personal,' said the museum. 'Here we are with direct imprints of past human activities that can be attached to a specific incident - a storm that destroyed a barrier, and which had to be repaired to ensure the survival of the population.' The earliest footprints left by humans outside Africa were found in mud in Norfolk in February. Described as 'the most important discovery on British shores', the 800,000-year-old footprints were discovered in Happisburgh after being exposed by sea tides. Scientists believe the footprints are evidence of the earliest known humans in northern Europe, previously only revealed through the discovery of animal bones and stone tools. The footprint surface was exposed at low tide as heavy seas removed the beach sands to reveal a series of elongated hollows cut into compacted silts. Of the 50 footprints found, only around twelve were reasonably complete while two showed the toes in detail. In some cases the heel, arch and even toes could be identified, equating to modern shoes of up to UK size 8.","Archaeologists found the prints during work at the Femern Belt Tunnel .

Three Lions boss Roy Hodgson revealed before the game that Sterling has complained 'a little about being tired and was not at his best.' Sterling's absence from the starting line-up led to much debate to whether or not a young footballer should be revealing he is 'tired' before a match. The 19-year-old didn't complete training on the Saturday night, starting the Estonia qualifier on the bench . Dennis Mumble, South Africa Football Association chief executive, said of Mashaba: 'We will not tolerate an individual who does not take national call-ups seriously.'

"Arsenal would be teetering on the edge of the relegation zone were it not for summer signing Alexis Sanchez. The £30million man brought in from Barcelona has virtually been single-handedly keeping Arsene Wenger's side competitive with his goals and assists this season. Although this has been far from a vintage Arsenal season and they sit sixth in the table, were it not for Sanchez's crucial contribution of eight goals and two assists they would be in 17th on 10 points. Alexis Sanchez celebrates after scoring for Arsenal against Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium on Sunday .

Assists 2 Chances created 24 . Premier League only, stats via Opta . Sanchez has earned them an extra seven points already this campaign. Against Crystal Palace he set up Aaron Ramsey to turn a 1-1 draw into a win and his double against Sunderland secured victory. He scored versus Leicester and Manchester City to salvage a point in both games and earned them one more against Hull by scoring and setting up Danny Welbeck's last-minute equaliser. The Chilean's form is up there with the best, with 12 goals in his last 14 games in all competitions and it appears Wenger has found the goal-scorer he needed. 'His quality is exceptional, he takes responsibility and goes at people. He fights, he can score, that is what you want from great players,' Wenger has said this season.

After rising between two burly Burnley defenders to head in against them, in their 3-0 win in which he scored twice, Wenger said: ‘I didn’t count on him in the air at all. 'But I know that in the air it is more about desire and he has that. He is a winner and finds the resources to get you a goal when it is 0-0. That’s what is important. 'We are in a job where you can always improve. He is unbelievably keen and every day wants to practise.’ The Frenchman has even compared Sanchez to Luis Suarez, adding: 'There are similarities with Suarez a little bit. By going at you, by being where you do not expect him to be in the box and by having that huge desire to be at the end of things.' Given how Liverpool are so desperately struggling with out the Uruguayan, Wenger will not want to become so reliant on one player.

"Chelsea midfielder Willian has spoken of his desire to score more goals, admitting that it is something manager Jose Mourinho has asked him to improve.

'(The intensity) was something I was prepared for when I signed for Chelsea because I could see in the games I watched on television just how intense the matches are in this country. 'I knew I needed to be ready to put in a lot hard work. If I was going to hold a place in the team, then I would have to run my heart out in every single match I play.'

The former Fulham midfielder – who retired two years ago following a series of crippling knee injuries – is among 10 famous faces to descend on Australia for the annual I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! show.

"An overweight mother-of-two whose crippling post-natal depression left her comfort eating and afraid to leave her own home has turned her life around through hypnosis. Nicola Lamb, from Preston, Lancs, was severely depressed after the birth of her second child Joshua, in December 2012, and ballooned to more than 14st. Too embarrassed to venture out, the 34-year-old comforted herself by gorging on takeaways and sugary snacks - and lived in leggings and jogging bottoms. Scroll down for video . Nicola dropped form 14st (left) to 10st (right) by using hypnosis to conquer her comfort eating . Nicola tried the weight loss app on a whim, having attempted many diets before, and was amazed when her appetite began to reduce . But after discovering Easy Loss - a hypnosis app - Nicola lost 4st in just six months and dropped from a size 18 to a svelte size 8-10. Nicola listened to the app every night, and continues to use it now. The app - 'Easyloss Virtual Gastric Band Hypnosis– Lose Weight Fast' - was created by clinical hypnotherapists James Holmes and Sue Peckham and is a hypnosis recording that she would listen to every night and fall asleep to. She said: 'The first night I listened to the hypnosis I found it really relaxing and soothing. And I noticed a difference straight away when I woke up the next day. 'I would listen to it every night and fall asleep to the hypnosis – the things it said just seemed to make sense. 'For example we are all told as we grow up to finish our plates and not leave any food. But why are we told that? If we are full, we don't need to keep eating. 'Easy Loss has taught me to stop eating when I am full, and I have changed the sizes of my plates and the portion sizes I give myself. It has totally changed my attitude and my mind set. 'The weight came off quite quickly for me, and it only took six months to reach my goal weight. 'And within about one month of starting the programme I noticed a change in my mental state too.' She is now the thinnest she has ever been - and has recovered from the crippling post natal depression that left her reluctant to leave home after giving birth to one-year-old Joshua. Nicola, who also has two-year-old Mia with husband Chris, said: 'I have tried every stupid diet available - I would lose weight initially but I would just pile it back on again. The mother-of-two suffered postnatal depression after the birth of her second child, son Joshua . 'I just stumbled across Easy Loss as I was looking for something to help me lose the weight for good on my iPad and I typed in 'gastric band'. 'I noticed it straight away and thought I would give it a try as it was just £4.99, and I would spend that easily on a takeaway or a week at Weight Watchers anyway. 'But I noticed a difference straight away, my portion sizes are smaller and now I only eat what I need to eat. It just worked - I can't explain it. 'After I had Joshua I was severely depressed and just ate complete rubbish.. I was a shell of my former self. Nicola, left with daughter Mia before she lost weight, used to live in baggy clothes, embarrassed about her size but now regularly goes out and socializes, loving her new found confidence . 'The post natal depression came on with being told I would never have children, to all of a sudden having two tiny babies to look after. 'I was too embarrassed to leave the house - it was sink or swim for me and I just sank. The more weight I put on the more depressed I got. 'And if I did go out the anxiety would just be too much, it would spiral out of control.' Former accountant Nicola has always battled with her weight - but now, at just 10st , the numbers on the scales are at the lowest they have been since her childhood. And, thanks to her new confidence, she also does a Zumba class twice a week to help keep her weight down and improve her fitness. Breakfast: Nothing . Snacks: Three or four chocolate bars . Lunch: A large sandwich and crisps . Snacks: Two more chocolate bars . Dinner: Takeaway or pizza with chips and ice-cream . Breakfast: One slice of toast or cereal . Snacks: Nothing . Lunch: Sandwich (two slices of bread) or a jacket potato . Snacks: Fruit . Dinner: Stew or homemade soup . Nicola said: 'The kids were the reason I wanted to lose the weight - I would look at them and think I want to be able to go places and do things with them. 'I didn't want to be the fat mum picking them up from school that they were embarrassed about. 'Now I am the thinnest I have ever been and I feel amazing. Everyone comments on the difference too. I feel like I am back to my old self. 'I am much more active and I take the kids out almost every day.

"Afghanistan is to release 65 prisoners from a former U.S. prison today despite protests from the American military, which says the men are Taliban fighters who will likely return to the battlefield to kill coalition and Afghan forces. The move further strains relations between Washington and President Hamid Karzai, whose increasingly anti-American rhetoric and refusal to sign a long-negotiated bilateral security deal has increased uncertainty ahead of the year-end withdrawal of most international combat troops. Karzai ordered the detainees released several weeks ago, after his government took over the prison from U.S. troops. Scroll down for video . Afghanistan is releasing 65 accused militants from a former U.S. prison today despite protests from the American military, which says the men are Taliban fighters who will likely return to the battlefield to kill coalition and Afghan forces (file photo) The decision prompted angry denunciations from Washington. U.S. forces in Afghanistan say some of the men are responsible for killing or wounding dozens of international and Afghan soldiers as well making bombs that have killed civilians. The prisoners were freed just after 9 a.m. from the Parwan Detention Facility near Bagram Air Field, about 45 kilometers (28 miles) north of Kabul, according to prison spokesman Maj. Nimatullah Khaki. They boarded a bus to leave the facility, laughing and smiling, he said. The U.S. has argued for the detainees to face trial in Afghan courts - citing strong evidence against them, from DNA linking them to roadside bombs to explosive residue on their clothing - but Kabul has cited insufficient proof to hold them. Karzai has referred to the Parwan prison as a 'Taliban-producing factory' where innocent Afghans are tortured into hating their country.

US soldiers stand guard beside prison cells during a media tour of Bagram prison, north of Kabul in 2009 . The U.S. military late Wednesday night issued a strongly worded statement condemning the imminent release, which it said would include detainees directly linked to attacks that have killed or wounded 32 U.S. or coalition personnel and 23 Afghan security personnel or civilians. The move further strains relations between Washington and President Hamid Karzai . A statement from the U.S. Embassy in Kabul on Thursday called the release 'deeply regrettable' and called on Karzai's government to ensure those released do not commit new acts of violence. 'We requested a thorough review of each case. Instead, the evidence against them was never seriously considered,' the embassy statement said, adding, 'The Afghan government bears responsibility for the results of its decision.' Afghan Defense Ministry spokesman Mohammad Zair Azimi would not comment on U.S concerns. 'Our responsibility is the protection of the prisoners. That is all,' Azimi said by telephone. The 65 were among 88 detainees at the facility that are the subject of dispute between Kabul and Washington. The U.S. says that they are dangerous members of the Taliban insurgency, the Haqqani group of militants and other Islamic radicals bent on fighting foreign and Afghan government forces. Among those believed to have walked free Thursday morning was Mohammad Wali, who the U.S. military says is a suspected Taliban explosives expert who allegedly placed roadside bombs targeting Afghan and international forces. The military said Wali had been biometrically linked to two roadside explosions and had a latent fingerprint match on another improvised explosive device. He had also tested positive for explosives residue. The United States only recently transferred the prison at Bagram to Afghan control after it had become a serious source of tension with the government in Afghanistan which is fighting a Taliban-led insurgency . About 30 percent had participated in direct attacks that killed or wounded 60 U.S. and coalition troops, a U.S. official said . Others in the group include Nek Mohammad - who the U.S. says was captured with extensive weapons - and a man identified as Ehsanullah, who is claimed to have been biometrically matched to a roadside bomb and who tested positive for explosives residue. The U.S. military had formally disputed the prisoners' release, but an Afghan review board had effectively overruled those challenges. The detainees' release has been in the works for weeks, and comes as Karzai has taken an increasingly hostile tone toward the U.S. ahead of the withdrawal of NATO combat troops at the end of 2014. The president has refused to sign a Bilateral Security Agreement would allow about 10,000 U.S. troops and about 6,000 from allied nations to remain in Afghanistan past 2014, largely to help train Afghanistan security forces to take over the fight against the Taliban and other militants 13 years after the international military intervention in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks in the U.S. The NATO-backed coalition toppled the Taliban's regime of hard-line Islamic law for sheltering the al-Qaida leadership behind the U.S. attacks. Karzai had tentatively endorsed the bilateral security deal after it was completed last October, but after it was approved by a council of tribal elders known as the Loya Jirga in November, he refused to sign it - saying he wants his successor to decide about it after the April 5 presidential election. Karzai cannot run because he is ineligible to serve a third term. The U.S. wants the deal signed as soon as possible because it needs time to prepare to keep thousands of U.S. troops in the country for up to a decade. NATO allies also have said they won't stay if the Americans pull out.","Released the accused militants from Bagram detention facility .

"The deadly Ebola virus could be used by terrorists to create a dirty bomb capable of killing large numbers of people in the UK, a Cambridge University disease expert has warned. As fears grow over the spread of the disease across parts of West Africa, biological anthropologist Dr Peter Walsh said that although the risk of it reaching the UK was small, a group such as Al Qaeda could use the virus to create a weapon. There is currently no vaccine and no cure for Ebola, which kills up to 90 per cent of its victims. Threat: The deadly Ebola virus, which medics are trying to contain in West Africa (pictured), could be used by terrorists to create a dirty bomb capable of killing large numbers of people, a Cambridge University disease expert has Dr Peter Walsh has warned . Although there have been calls for the introduction of fever-screening cameras at UK airports in the wake of the current outbreak, Dr Walsh told a newspaper that should an infected air passenger unwittingly bring Ebola to Britain, medical experts would be able to stop the virus spreading further. 'A bigger and more serious risk is that a group manages to harness the virus as a power, then explodes it as a bomb in a highly populated public area,' Dr Walsh told The Sun on Sunday. 'It could cause a large number of horrific deaths. 'Only a handful of labs worldwide have the Ebola virus and they are extremely well-protected. So the risk is that a terrorist group seeks to obtain the virus out in West Africa.' The current outbreak of Ebola has already claimed 729 deaths from 1329 confirmed cases in the West African . countries of Guinea, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Liberia. The fatality rate in the current epidemic is about 60 per cent. Risk: Dr Walsh said that as only a handful of labs worldwide have the Ebola virus (pictured under a microscope), terrorists could try to obtain it in West Africa . The outbreak is unusual for West Africa as the disease is typically found in the center and east of the continent. Early symptoms of an Ebola . infection include fever, headache, muscle aches and sore throat, while in the later stages of the disease victims begin bleeding both . internally and externally, often through the nose and ears, and suffer organ failure. Among those infected are American doctor Dr Kent Brantly, 33, . who contracted the virus while in Liberia. He has been brought back to . the U.S. for treatment in a special isolation ward, and was today said . to be improving. However, . the top U.S. health official Dr Tom Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, has said it was still too soon . to predict whether he would survive. A . second U.S. aid worker who contracted Ebola while working in the same . facility as Brantly, 59-year-old missionary Nancy Writebol, will be . brought to the United States on a later flight as the medical aircraft . is equipped to carry only one patient at a time. Hope: Liberian Christians pray for God's divine intervention in the eradication of Ebola at their church in Monrovia today . Anger: Liberians stage a protest against the use of their home town pf Johnsonville to bury the victims of the Ebola virus . Symptoms: Early symptoms of an Ebola infection include fever, headache, muscle aches and sore throat, while in the later stages of the disease victims begin bleeding both internally and externally. Pictured are military police deployed at the burial site for victims in Johnsonville . The virus is not airborne and is transmitted through direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person. However, WHO director-general Margaret Chan has warned the virus is currently moving faster than efforts to control it. She said: ‘This outbreak is moving faster than our efforts to control it. If the situation continues to deteriorate, the consequences can be catastrophic in terms of lost lives, severe socioeconomic disruption and a high risk of spread to other countries.’ Speaking at a meeting in Guinea’s capital Conakry, she told the presidents of Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast that the virus could be stopped, but warned that some cultural practices such as traditional burials were helping it to spread. Emirates, the Middle East's largest airline, said today it had halted flights to Guinea because of concerns about the spread of the Ebola virus. Treatment: Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, where American Ebola victim Dr Kent Brantly is being treated . Responding: Reporters gather at the entrance to the hospital after an ambulance transporting Dr Brantly arrives. He was said to be responding well to treatment, although experts say it is too early to tell if he will survive . The Dubai-based carrier said flights to the Guinean capital of Conakry were suspended beginning Saturday until further notice. The airline will continue flying to the West African nation of Senegal, which borders Guinea, saying it 'will be guided by the updates from international health authorities'. The Foreign Office refused to confirm if British citizens who contract the virus abroad would be flown back for treatment, saying only: ‘Procedures are in place but we are not going to speculate on what we would do in any individual case.’ Labour MP and chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee has urged ministers to consider introducing fever-screening cameras at UK airports as up to 10,000 passengers arrive in the UK every week on 30 direct flights from West Africa. South Africa, which has fewer direct flights from the region than the UK, introduced infra-red thermal imaging cameras at two major airports in April, in an early response to the ebola threat, while Sierra Leone, Guinea, Ghana, and Nigeria have pledged to introduce temperature screening at airports. However critics say the cameras can give ‘false positives’ – including people with minor illnesses and those who are hot after a dash through the airport. Mr Vaz said: ‘As far as I’m concerned any measures – including additional screening – which are felt necessary to reassure the public should be taken. ‘Prevention is always better than cure: We don’t want to have our first taste of ebola before taking action.’","Dr Peter Walsh says group such as Al Qaeda could use virus to create bomb .

"It was on the first Tuesday in December, 1957, that little Maria Ridulph disappeared after taking a piggy back ride from a stranger. Her disappearance from a small town in the rich farmlands of Illinois shocked America: it seemed she had vanished into thin air in the safest corner of the United States. All that was known was that she had been seen taking a piggyback ride from a strange man near her home - a man her friend said was called 'Johnny'. Long months followed until the seven-year-old's body was found in a field the following Spring. It was worse than could have been expected: she had been choked with a wire and stabbed. Her family hoped that the killer would be brought to justice quickly but in the end they had to wait - an astonishing 55 years for justice. The coldest case in US history was finally closed in 2012 when Maria's killer was convicted using a deathbed confession by his mother that had re-opened the investigation. Scroll down for video . Vanished: Maria Ridulph was just seven when she disappeared from the small community of Sycamore, Illinois, in a crime which shocked 1950s America. Her family had to wait from 1957 until 2012 to see the case closed . Convicted: Jack McCullough (left as a teenager) was 73 (right in a police mugshot) when he was jailed for the murder of Maria Ridulph 55 years previously. He went on to become a Washington State policeman . Family: Jack McCullough (left) with his mother, Eileen, growing up in Sycamore, Illinois. Her deathbed confession that she provided a false alibi for her son . Now a new documentary is telling the incredible story of how Jack McCullough was finally caught in a case that was so shocking it attracted the attention of former FBI director J Edgar Hoover. 'Footsteps in the Snow', based on a book of the same name, will be shown tonight (Wed) on the Lifetime Movie Network. It stitches together the events that took place in Sycamore, Illinois, a tiny farming community of 7,000 people that would never be the same again after families and friends turned against each other in the hunt for the killer. The documentary features interviews with, among others, McCullough, who speaks from the prison in Illinois where he will likely die. The book's author Charles Lachman told MailOnline that there was 'nothing like' the case in American history. He said: 'It's an epic story of crime and family that spans five decades. What's extraordinary is how this single event changed so many years so many years later. 'People alive in Sycamore, Illinois in 1957 remember the night Maria was kidnapped the way the rest of us remember where we were on 9/11, or, for an older generation, the Kennedy assassination. It's with you forever. 'Beyond that, the case made legal history. Never before had a criminal case from such a distant past ever been brought to justice in a criminal court in America.' Lachman, who is also executive producer of Inside Edition, added that the case was so compelling because it 'opened the door' to Sycamore's dark past. He said: 'Sycamore was the quintessential small town – a great place to grow up and raise a family. But there were all these secrets.' Reconstruction: A picture from the time shows how frighteningly close Maria Ridulph's abduction was to her front door . Happy child: Maria Ridulph at a birthday celebration before she vanished from Sycamore, Illinois, in 1957 . Picket fence childhood: Sycamore, Illinois seemed like the epitome of small-town America in the 1950s until its security was shattered by Maria Ridulph's disappearance and murder . Loved: Little Maria was from a happy family who were utterly shocked at her disappearance. The whole community of Sycamore felt haunted by the case . Last resting place: Maria's family buried her in Sycamore, where her murderer was sentenced to life in prison in 2012, 55 years after she was murdered . Relief: Kathy Chapman (left) and Mary Hunt (right) after the conviction of Jack McCullough in 2012 for the murder of Maria Ridulph. Hunt is the murdered girl's half-sister while Chapman was her childhood friend and with her until minutes before she was absucted . Maria was a brown-eyed second grader when she disappeared from the corner of Archie Place and Center Cross Street in Sycamore on the evening of December 3, 1957. She had just taken a piggy back ride with a man who introduced himself as 'Johnny' - and then took away to her doom. It was crime that shocked America and then president Dwight D Eisenhower reportedly asked for regular updates on the case. Maria's mother Frances and father Michael pleaded on TV for her to come home but the following April her body was discovered 120 miles away by a grove of trees, and a homicide inquiry was begun. Seventeen-year-old McCullough, who was known then as John Tessier, was given an alibi by his parents who told investigators he was in the city of Rockford 40 miles away. He also passed an FBI polygraph and told agents he'd been traveling to Chicago for a medical exam before joining the Air Force. The inquiry looked at 100 persons of interest but nobody was arrested and nobody was brought to justice. Years passed and Maria's parents would endured unimaginable agony until 1994 when McCullough's mother Eileen Tessier died - and told her daughters that she lied to give her son an alibi 36 years earlier. Another 14 years passed until 2008 when the Illinois state police finally reopened the case at the request of McCullough's half sister Janet Tessier. When McCullough was arrested he was living in Seattle and was working as a security guard under a different name. During his lifetime he also been in the Air Force, the Army and worked as a Washington state police officer. In 2012 Maria's body was exhumed and his trial went ahead, heavily relying on witnesses who tried their best to recall events more than half a century old. Long road: Pat Quinn and Charles Ridulph, the brother and sister of Maria, who had waited 55 years for their sibling's murderer, McCullough, to be brought to justice and said: 'Now Maria is at peace.' Serviceman: McCullough served in the Air Force and Army and went on to be a Washington State policeman. He was 18 and an airman when he killed Maria . Family photo: McCullough sent this image of him in uniform to a family member. It was almost certainly taken after he murdered Maria Ridulph. Portrait of a killer: McCullough was painted nude in the 1980s for this image, around 30 years after he murdered the seven-year-old Maria Ridulph . The key testimony came from Kathy Chapman, a childhood friend of Maria's who was with her until moments before she disappeared. She was shown an old photograph of McCullough and identified him as 'Johnny'. She recalled how she ran up and down the snow covered street before dashing home to tell her family: 'Maria's lost! I can't find Maria!' Now 63, Chapman was just eight at the time it happened. Tessier also told the court about her mother's confession and after McCullough refused to give evidence he was found guilty. Before the sentencing prosecutor, Victor Escarcida said that McCullough had 'left a lifetime of emotional wreckage in his wake'. He said: 'Jack McCullough made Sycamore a scary place. Now there was a true boogeyman living among them. He is the definition of evil.' Maria's parents were not there to see the verdict as they had died in the 1990s. But speaking after the hearing, Maria's older brother Charles Ridulph said he was 'satisfied' with the sentence. He said: 'This is all we could expect. Now Maria is finally at peace.' The conviction also gave observers a chance to look again at the missed chances to prosecute McCullough which could have brought about justice sooner. Lachman told MailOnline that the case took so long to come to court because it was a 'mess' from the beginning. He said: 'The original investigation was afflicted by police dysfunction and incompetence. There were issues of jurisdiction. 'Who was in charge? The FBI? The state police.? The local authorities? 'Everybody found it hard to believe that the crime could have been committed by a local boy.' Interest: J Edgar Hoover, then Director of the FBI, (left) and President Dwight D Eisenhower (right) were both reportedly updated on the case of the missing seven-year-old, reflecting the shock felt in 1950s America at the crime . Widely reported: The story was headline news not just in Dekalb County, Illinois, but across the country . Earlier this year McCullough, now 74, filed an 80-page appeal saying there was no forensic evidence tying him to the crime. He says that since it happened so long ago there was no way the witnesses could remember what they saw. The appeal states: 'The evidence against Jack McCullough, was so unreasonable, so improbable, and so unsatisfactory as to create a reasonable doubt that he was responsible for a 1957 murder, kidnapping, and abduction of an infant.' The hearing will be held on December 3 - with deep irony, 57 years to the day since Maria went missing.","Maria Ridulph vanished into thin air in small town Sycamore, Illinois, in December 1957 .

"The man who carried out the brutal hatchet attack on two NYPD officers was heavily motivated by radical Islam and was 'jihadist inspired', a new intelligence report reveals. The preliminary report into Zale Thompson's October 23 assault initially concluded the 32-year-old, who used the name Zaim Farouq Abdul-malik on social media, was influenced by anti-government or black power sentiments. However, a four page intelligence report from the NYPD has confirmed Thompson's self-radicalization and his creeping obsession with terror outfits such as al-Qaeda and Islamic State. Scroll Down to See Report . Officers piecing together the life of New York hatchet attacker Zale Thompson (pictured) say he visited 277 websites to do with ISIS, beheadings and jihad before attacking cops three weeks ago . According to the report, seen by Fox News, Thompson, 'may have held a long-standing interest in violent jihad.' Thompson was arrested (seen here) in southern California six times between 2002 and 2003, likely for domestic disputes, New York Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce said. In their initial investigation, the NYPD discovered 277 online search terms by the former US Navy serviceman that referred directly to jihad. The intelligence reports states that 'Thompson used internet search engines to query specific terms including but not limited to 'lone wolf', 'jihad' and 'jihad against the police.' Thompson's chilling attack was carried out in complete silence before he was shot dead after running up to four officers in New York brandishing a hatchet, before wounding cop Kenneth Healey, 25, in the head, and slashing another in the arm. Mr Healey was taken to hospital on in critical condition but has now been released. While the report raises fears of more lone wolf attacks by self-radicalized Americans, 'there is no evidence that Thompson conspired with other individuals to carry out the attack.' It reveals that Thompsons favorite internet searches were for terror groups such as al-Qaeda, its Somalian branch, al-Shabaab and ISIS. The NYPD also found that Thompson's seaches online brought up terms such as 'jihad against the infidels,' and 'fatwa against americans' and 'death to America in Arabic.' Others searches such as 'is Saudi Arabia a member of the United Nations' and 'Saudi Arabic 69th general assembly un' raise the frightening possibility that Thompson may have wanted to target the United Nations in New York City. Investigators say Thompson stalked cops for hours in New York before launching his assault as they were having their pictures taken - wounding Kenneth Healey (second left) in the head . Thompson can be seen dead on the street, face up in a green coat, moments after attacking the officers. Kenneth Healey is laying face down with a hatchet gash in his head . Also added as part of the report is a photograph which shows that Thompson was stalking the four cops before the attack on the streets. In addition to the serious injuries Officer Healey suffered, Officer Joseph Meeker, 24, was also struck in the arm. Both are now recovering. 'This was jihadist inspired. Plain and simple,' said Frank Cilluffo, associate vice president and director of the Homeland Security Policy Institute of George Washington University to Fox News. 'He had so many search terms in this respect, I think it would be very difficult to suggest that it's anything but.' After the twin attack on Canadian soldiers last month, the NYPD has said it is stepping up its protocols and safety procedures. An officer attends to Healey, pressing a cloth against his wound, as the other officers train their weapons at Thompson. Healey remains in critical condition at a New York hospital . Thompson still holds his hatchet in his hand after being shot dead by two NYPD officers after he slashed two cops in an ambush attack . ""As I understand it, NYPD is already instituting new actions, and new steps where instead of patrolling alone, they are going to have group patrols, and stay together even, even simple measures such as having lunch. They are hoping that people will stick together, so you can have two eyes and ears on potential threat,"" Cilluffo said. Chilling pictures taken seconds before the October 23 attacks show Mr Healy standing along with four fellow officers before they were attacked by Thompson. Dominick Williams took the photos after spotting the officers and asking them to stand for a picture. Seconds later, Thompson ran up to the cops - who where standing against a wall in Jamaica, Queens - and started swinging a sharp hand axe. Mr Healey, a rookie who had been on the force for just four months before he was injured, was taken to hospital in critical condition but has since recovered . Weapon: This is the hatchet that Thompson used to carry out his attack on the two cops in Queens, New York City . Mr Williams says he scrambled for safety as the officers wrestled with Thompson. He hacked Officer Joseph Meeker, 24, in the arm before burying the hatchet in Healey's skull. Mr Williams' camera captured the frantic aftermath of the attack. Officer Healey - who had just four months on the job - can be seen laying face down on the sidewalk - a bloody gash in his head. Another officer can be seen tending to his fallen comrade, holding a cloth over the head wound. The pictures also capture Thompson dead on the sidewalk. His body is face up with the hatchet, still in his had, laid across his chest.","Zale Thompson, 32, attacked 4 cops in Jamaica, Queens, three weeks ago .

"Zoe Fennessy, 26, has an epileptic seizure within seconds of hearing the singer Ne-Yo's vocals . A mother has undergone surgery to remove part of her brain in a bid to stop crippling seizures which she claims are triggered by the sound of a pop star's voice . Zoe Fennessy, 26, has an epileptic seizure within seconds of hearing the chart-topping singer Ne-Yo's vocals. The seizures make her freeze, vomit and unable to react to the world around her. The healthcare assistant has to wear earphones whenever she goes shopping just in case the 'Let's Go' singer's tunes are played in stores. She has been clinically diagnosed with 'musicogenic seizures' which are triggered by the tone of Ne-Yo's voice. Surgeons removed part of her left frontal lobe in June in a bid to stop the affliction. But the surgery was not successful and doctors now fear she may have the condition forever. Miss Fennessy - who has been unable to work for six months because of her affliction - said: 'I don't dislike Ne-Yo or his music, it just dislikes me unfortunately. 'I'll be walking around the supermarket doing my food shopping and I have to put my earphones in to listen to my own music just in case it comes on. 'It's the same with most shops. I have to walk in with my ear phones in at first just to make sure they don't have Ne-Yo on. 'If he ever releases a greatest hits album it's going to be a nightmare. 'Whenever I hear the first few beats of the song I have to drop whatever I am doing and run. 'People might think it is funny - and I can laugh at it myself - but it has taken over my life. It's ruined my life.' Miss Fennessy, from Retford, Nottinghamshire, had her first seizure on New Year's Day in 2006 after a long period of sickness and doctors put it down to tiredness and stress. But when her seizures increased to six a day, her GP booked her in for a brain test and she was diagnosed with epilepsy in 2008. It wasn't until she heard Ne-Yo's first big hit, 'Give Me Everything' featuring Pitbull - which topped the charts in May 2011 - that she had her first music-induced seizure. Scroll down for video . Ms Fennessy has been diagnosed with musicogenic seizures. Her medical notes state: 'We recognised a few musicogenic seizures arising from the right temporal lobe stimulated by songs sung by Ne-Yo' (pictured) In June, surgeons removed part of her left frontal lobe  to try and stop the seizures. But the surgery was not successful and doctors now fear she may have the condition forever . 'It took me a while to realise that they were being triggered by his songs. 'It wasn't until I'd heard it for about the 15th time that it finally twigged what was going on.' 'The song was really popular and I went to my consultant and I said ""I know this sounds extremely bizarre, but every time I hear this song I have a seizure"". 'He said it was fascinating and that he'd never heard anything like it. 'I stressed that while it might be fascinating, I was really struggling - the song was everywhere at the time.' A musicogenic seizure is epilepsy triggered by certain types of music or even specific frequencies of pitch for which the person's brain has a low threshold or tolerance. These sounds trigger abnormal activity on the brain. In some cases, merely thinking of the atmosphere and the emotions associated with a certain stimulus is enough to induce a seizure. They may also occur during sleep. To read more, click here . Miss Fennessy was referred to Sheffield's Royal Hallamshire Hospital. There, doctors played Ne-Yo songs and were amazed when they induced a seizure. Her doctors notes from the time say: 'We recognised a few musicogenic seizures arising from the right temporal lobe stimulated by songs sung by Ne-Yo.' Another added: 'During her admission she was listening to the radio on [her] iPhone when a specific song came on the radio that triggers her fits (Pitbull Ne-Yo - Tonight). 'She called for assistance at this point and she was noted to be shaking and looking rather anxious and acting a bit confused. 'The following day we deliberately played the song and exactly the same symptoms arose.' The music attacks got more difficult to manage as the singer became more popular with every song he released, including top ten hits 'Let's Go' and 'Turn Around' in 2012. The 15 second seizures, which happen in her right temporal lobe, leave her 'staring blankly' and after they pass she will vomit, be very thirsty and feel extremely sleepy. In June this year, Miss Fennessy endured a six-hour long operation to remove a huge chunk of her left temporal lobe where doctors thought all her seizures may originate. But while the symptoms of her epilepsy have reduced, she still has a fit every time she hears Ne-Yo's voice. Ms Fennessy has to wear earphones whenever she goes shopping just in case the 'Let's Go' singer's tunes are played in stores . She said a recent holiday to Majorca - just after the singer released his song Play Hard with David Guetta - was a 'nightmare' with the song playing in every bar. 'I have had to go up to DJs in places and say 'look can you not play Ne-Yo' and they just look at me like I'm an alien,' said Zoe. '[Doctors] are saying it could possibly be something in the tone of his voice, something like that, but it doesn't happen when I hear Usher, or people like him who have a very similar sound. It is only him, only Ne-Yo.' 'Our holiday this year to Majorca was a nightmare. Honestly it was like being at a Ne-Yo concert - the song was everywhere. 'I had to stay in the hotel room for most of the holiday because it got so bad.'","Zoe Fennessy, 26, has an epileptic seizure within seconds of hearing singer .

"Sir Ian Botham has revealed the trauma his family went through during his father’s battle with dementia - and has begged ‘not to be judged’ by people ‘who haven’t been through it’ for his decision to stop visiting once the disease got worse. The former England all-rounder’s father, Les, began suffering from rapidly-debilitating Alzheimer’s disease from the early 2000s. Les’ condition swiftly worsened and, before his death in December 2005 at the age of 82, Botham could no longer face the pain of seeing his father struggle to recognise his loved ones when they visited. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sir Ian Botham discuss his father's battle with dementia . Sir Ian Botham has opened up about the heartbreak his family went through with his father's dementia battle . The former England all-rounder's father, Les, began suffering from the dreaded disease in the early 2000s . Botham and his mother, Marie – who died in April 2012 at the age of 85 – had taken Les to a specialist home in order to provide him with 24-hour care, but the visits became more painful than rewarding and so the former Somerset, Durham and Worcestershire star made the decision to stop seeing his father. ‘I didn’t want to see my dad like this – all that I was looking at was a cavity of what was my father,’ Botham told BBC’s Inside Out special on Alzheimer’s in the first interview he has given on the subject on television. ‘And I said “mum, you’ve got to stop going” but she said “no I can’t”. I said: “Mum you come back and it’s tearing you apart. You sit there, you’re in tears – he doesn’t know who you are anymore. He doesn’t recognise us.” We’d come in and he’d look up. He’d have someone on his arm and he’d say: “Are you staying here?” ‘He had no idea who I was or who my mum was. So I said: “Mum, I am making a decision now. I have got so many great memories of my father – I am not going anymore and I really wish you wouldn’t because it’s not doing you any good. I’m not going because it’s destroying everything I loved about my father. I don’t want to have to see him like this in this vegetable state.” And I just refused to go. ‘The way to deal with it for me was not to see him. Everyone’s different, and please I beg everyone please don’t judge unless you’ve been there because it is horrendous. To see someone that you have so much time for, who you spent so much time with, so much quality time with, who drove me around as kid and what have you – I don’t want to see that person in that state.’ Botham’s father had been one of the biggest influences on his sporting career and also his life, but England’s leading Test wicket-taker simply could not see someone he loved rapidly disappear mentally anymore. Botham says his father was one of the biggest influences on his sporting career and throughout his life . The former all-rounder did attend a pre-Ashes Alzheimer’s Australia event earlier this year, however, in order to support a cause which is close to his heart. And the Sky Sports cricket pundit, who scored 5,200 runs and took 383 wickets in Tests, was knighted for his charitable exploits in 2007. He has raised more than £12million since 1985 by covering more than 10,000 miles on foot and he hopes to continue raising money for various causes – one of them being to help cure dementia. The 58-year-old continued: ‘I think it was Oscar Wilde who wrote: “We start life as a child and we end life as a child.” That’s exactly where Les was going – he was going the full cycle. ‘So we got him into a home and my mother would go down religiously every day and as this went on, I went with her when I was there. It actually came to it where there was no point in going – he had to be sedated to have a shower, he got violent, he lost all his bodily controls, he was totally dysfunctional. The Sky Sports cricket pundit says it was heartbreaking to see his father develop into a 'vegetable state' ‘He was fit, healthy, bright, clever, a sportsman, a father, a grandfather. He would have been horrified to see himself and I wasn’t prepared to keep on looking at him like that and seeing this person who didn’t even know who he was. ‘That’s why I didn’t go. Unless you’ve been in that situation, you’ve made those decisions and you’ve seen what can happen – that’s why I’m so pleased they seem to be making advances with the disease and they are coming up with medication. ‘I know you’ll never be able to cure it – we probably will in many, many years’ time – but we can certainly prolong and give that person more quality of life.’ Botham even believes his mother’s death was accelerated by the trauma of watching Les slowly fade away. ‘It had taken its toll on her to such an extent she had a heart attack- it was just too much for her,’ he explained.","Sir Ian Botham told his mother she had 'to stop going' to the specialist home when the disease worsened and his father didn't know who she was .

"Scientists have found a human jawbone that washed up on Mona Vale beach belongs to a skull that was found on the same beach six years earlier. The jawbone appeared on the north Sydney beach last Sunday at 10 am, when a member of the public spotted it on a concrete path. Officers from Northern Beaches local Area Command seized the bone, passing it onto an expert forensic anthropologist. A skull found on Mona Vale beach in 2008, which was found to be 700 years old and belonging to a young child aged between four and five . Scientific examinations showed not only that it was a human skull, but that it belonged to a skull that was found on the beach six years prior. In remarkably similar circumstances, a skull washed ashore on Mona Vale beach was spotted by an onlooker in September 2008. Forensic examinations found that it belonged to a child between four and five years old, and that the skull had been in the water for some time, reports The Australian. The skull was later sent to The University of Waikato in Hamilton, New Zealand,where it was found to be 700 years old. The radiocarbon dating determined the skull was dated between 1220AD and 1400AD.

'But for the overnight trips I'd always make sure I had a head-torch along with sleeping equipment including a tent, a sleeping bag and a sleeping mat. 'I capture images of people as they interact with the outdoor landscape such as backpacking, mountaineering, trail running or cycling,' he explained. 'My experience of many of these sports, plus my project management skills and self-reliance outdoors, gives me the ability to plan complex photo shoots, even in remote locations, and deliver high-quality, creative adventure sports images.'

"Manchester United’s prolific teenage striker James Wilson admits he is hoping for a first-team chance under Louis van Gaal after scoring four goals in the Manchester Senior Cup final on Thursday night. Wilson, 18, was the star player as United’s under-21 side thrashed Manchester City 4-1 to earn the club their second trophy of the week, following pre-season success in America. The Staffordshire youngster scored twice against Hull City on his Premier League debut under interim manager Ryan Giggs towards the end of last season and hopes Van Gaal gives him another chance despite leaving him out of the U.S. tour. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Manchester United's new goal machine James Wilson in action . Threat: James WIlson scored four goals against Patrick Vieira's Manchester City on Thursday . Derby: The two sides clashed in the final of the Manchester Senior Cup, Manchester United won 4-1 . ‘I hope I’ve impressed him the gaffer,’ said Wilson. ‘I showed him what I can do and hopefully I can get a call-up to do it in the first-team as well. ‘The Manchester derby was a great event, scoring four goals and getting the win over our greatest rivals is brilliant. They won the Premier League and wanted to keep success going with the academy.

But after that it was the Wilson show for Warren Joyce’s young United team. He levelled on the stroke of half-time and then twice breached the City defence to score early in the second half. Champion: This was United's second pre-season trophy after they won the International Champions Cup . Loan: James Wilson could be sent on loan if he can't persuade Van Gaal to let him be part of the first team .

"David Bowie's surprise comeback track  'Where Are We Now' will be make Sunday's UK charts after all, despite claims that the Official Charts Company ruled it out of the running.

"Russia's long-range bombers will range from the Arctic Ocean to the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico on regular patrol missions, the military said Wednesday, a show of muscle reflecting tensions with the West over Ukraine. A statement from Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu's statement comes as NATO has reported a spike in Russian military flights over the Black, Baltic and North seas as well as the Atlantic Ocean. It reflects Moscow's increasingly tough posture amid tensions with the West over Ukraine and its role in the conflict in Syria. Shoigu said Russian long-range bombers will conduct flights along Russian borders and over the Arctic Ocean. He added that 'in the current situation we have to maintain military presence in the western Atlantic and eastern Pacific, as well as the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico.' Saber rattling: Russia's defense minister Sergei Shoigu says the military will conduct regular long-range bomber patrols, ranging from the Arctic Ocean to the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico (FILE: Russian military Tu-95 bombers over international airspace) He said that the increasing pace and duration of flights would require stronger maintenance efforts. Russian nuclear-capable strategic bombers were making regular patrols across the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans during the Cold War, but the post-Soviet money crunch forced the military to cut back. Col. Steve Warren, a Pentagon spokesman, declined to call this a Russian provocation. He said the Russians have a right, like any other nation, to operate in international airspace and in international waters. Gearing up? Sergei Shoigu's statement comes as NATO has reported a spike in Russian military flights over the Black, Baltic and North seas as well as the Atlantic Ocean. It reflects Moscow's increasingly tough posture amid tensions with the West over Ukraine. Here, Russian Air Force strategic bombers, Tu-95, fly in formation over Red Square . The important thing, Warren said, is for such exercises to be carried out safely and in accordance with international standards. Ian Kearns, director of the European Leadership Network, a London-based think tank, said the bomber patrols are part of Kremlin's efforts to make the Russian military 'more visible and more assertive in its actions'. The new bomber flights 'aren't necessarily presaging a threat,' Kearns said. ""They are just part of a general ramping-up of activities."" But, he added, 'The more instances you have of NATO and Russian forces coming close together, the more chance there is of having something bad happening, even if it's not intentional.' The bomber patrol flights have resumed under Putin's rule and have become increasingly frequent in recent years. On Monday, the European Leadership Network issued a report that found a sharp rise in Russian-NATO military encounters since the Kremlin's annexation of Crimea, including violations of national airspace, narrowly avoided midair collisions, close encounters at sea, harassment of reconnaissance planes, close overflights over warships, and Russian mock bombing raid missions. Three of the nearly 40 incidents, the think tank said, carried a 'high probability' of causing casualties or triggering a direct military confrontation: a narrowly avoided collision between a civilian airliner and a Russian surveillance plane, the abduction of an Estonian intelligence officer, and a large-scale  Swedish hunt for a suspected Russian submarine that yielded no result. In September, the report said, Russian strategic bombers in the Labrador Sea off Canada practiced cruise missile strikes on the U.S. Earlier this year, in May, . the report said, Russian military aircraft approached within 50 miles (80 kilometers) of the California coast, the closest such Russian military flight reported since the end of the Cold War. TROUBLE IN CHINA . Just Tuesday, the White House said Obama and Putin spoke three times on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific economic meeting, tackling some of the tough issues that have strained their relationship, including Russia's provocations in Ukraine and support for Syria's embattled government. They also discussed the fast-approaching deadline in nuclear talks with Iran, in which the U.S. and Russia find themselves on the same negotiating team. Unlike at some of their past meetings, Obama and Putin kept their deep-seated policy disagreements behind the scenes. But their public encounters suggested their relationship remains tense. Picturesque Yanqi Lake, just outside of Beijing, became the venue for an awkward pas de deux between two of the most powerful leaders in the world. Entering an ornate, wood-paneled room for the start of the summit, Obama and Putin looked a bit like sidekicks to Chinese President Xi Jinping. The summit's host led the way, with the American on one side and the Russian on the other. Trouble in China? Russian President Vladimir Putin passes by US President Barack Obama at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit on Tuesday where pleasantries in front of the camera reportedly hid the icy negotiations behind it over the thorny issues of Syria, Iran and Ukraine . Syrian strife: Syria asked Russia this month to speed up delivery of S-300 anti-aircraft missiles, concerned about a possible US attack, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said in an interview published Thursday. Here, a man carries the body of his son following a reported barrel bomb attack by government forces in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo . 'It's beautiful, isn't it?' Putin said in Obama's direction. Yes, it is, concurred a reticent Obama, avoiding eye contact with Putin and addressing his response to no one in particular. Neither the White House nor the Kremlin offered much in the way of detail about the policy conversations Obama and Putin had on the sidelines of the summit. Putin's spokesman said only that the two had spoken a few times, touching on 'bilateral relations, the situation around Ukraine, Syria and Iran.' THE ISSUE WITH IRAN . Also on Tuesday, Russia signed a contract Tuesday to build two more nuclear reactors in Iran to be possibly followed by another six, a move intended to cement closer ties between the two nations. The deal comes less than two weeks ahead of the Nov. 24 deadline for Tehran to sign an agreement on its nuclear program with six world powers. Tuesday's contract has no immediate relation to the talks that involve Russia and the United States, but it reflects Moscow's intention to deepen its cooperation with Tehran ahead of possible softening of Western sanctions against Iran. Nuclear officials from the two countries signed a contract Tuesday for building two reactors at Iran's first Russia-built nuclear plant in Bushehr. Undermining the West? Sergei Kiriyenko, right, head of the Russian state nuclear monopoly Rosatom, and head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation Ali Akbar Salehi shake hands during a signing ceremony in Moscow Tuesday. Russia will build two new nuclear power plant units in Iran under a deal made less than two weeks ahead of the Nov. 24 deadline for Tehran to sign an agreement on its nuclear program with six world powers . USURPING UKRAINE? And on Wednesday, NATO's top commander says new columns of Russian troops and tanks have rolled into eastern Ukraine, the claim promptly denied by Moscow. U.S. Gen. Philip Breedlove said Wednesday that in the last two days 'we have seen columns of Russian equipment, primarily Russian tanks, Russian artillery, Russian air defense systems and Russian combat troops entering into Ukraine.' Breedlove, who spoke in Sofia, Bulgaria wouldn't say how many fresh troops and weapons have moved into Ukraine and wouldn't specify how the alliance obtained the information. The Russian Defense Ministry quickly rejected Breedlove's statement as groundless. The West and Ukraine have continuously accused Moscow of fueling a pro-Russian insurgency in eastern Ukraine with troops and weapons - the claims Russia has rejected. Breedlove said the Russia-Ukraine border 'is completely wide-open.' Fortifying rebels? A pro-Russian gunmen patrol the centre of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine on November 12, 2014. Heavy artillery fire on Wednesday rocked east Ukraine's pro-Russian rebel bastion of Donetsk, after international monitors warned over escalating violence following the arrival of columns of insurgent reinforcements . Ignoring the world? An amored personnel carrier (APC) rolls on November 12 on a main road in rebel-territory near the village of Torez, east of Donetsk, in eastern Ukraine.

Many postal votes are presently stuck on the mainland this morning because the mail plane cannot get through. The Western Isles was in the running to be the first of 32 regions in Scotland to declare the local result, looking at a 1.30am announcement . But the blanket of fog lying over the islands has put well organised plans to use a charted plane to fly ballot boxes from Uist and Barra to the count centre in Stornoway. Ferries and boats will be put on stand-by today as it would too hazardous for aircraft to fly in such poor visibility. Average September conditions are set to return next week, but the Met Office said last night that the first half of September had been the UK’s driest since 1960. Official figures show there has been just a quarter of an inch (6.7mm) of rain on average across the UK between September 1 and 15. This is seven per cent of the month’s average of 3.8 inches (96mm). Daytime temperatures have been particularly high, with an average of 18.4C (65F) – 1.9C above usual. Night-time minimums have been closer to average at 9.6C (49F) – 0.7C above average. There has also been slightly more sunshine than normal for September so far – 70.8 hours, which is about 57 per cent of the full-month average. The figures come after a prolonged spell of fine, settled weather, dominated by high pressure sitting over the country. This has blocked the usual-low pressure systems that move in from the west and bring unsettled conditions. Nicky Maxey, of the Met Office, said: ‘Temperatures in parts could be about 10C above average for September, and it will feel warm overnight before cooling down a bit by Sunday.

It will be drier on Saturday.’ She said today could be the hottest day since the beginning of August, when 27.2C (80.96F) was recorded. The fine weather has led to near-perfect growing conditions for British vineyards, which are enjoying a better year than their French and Italian rivals and are expecting a record harvest in quality as well as quantity. Meanwhile, wine producers in southern Italy are braced for a 30 per cent drop in their harvest after the country endured a cool, rainy summer.

"Sir Cliff Richard was far from the circling media helicopters and the indignity of a police raid yesterday. As his lavish apartment in Sunningdale in Berkshire was searched, he was in Portugal where he had been staying at his magnificent cream-painted villa. He always stays at the estate on the Algarve from the end of the Wimbledon in July until the grapes ripen at the end of September. There is a vineyard near the house and he takes great pride in his award-winning wine. The singer, now 73, thinks of Portugal as his sanctuary. He sees almost no one when he is there – certainly none of his many showbusiness friends – and enjoys the peace of his manicured garden with its rows of pleasingly symmetrical cypresses, tended by his gardener. Scroll down for video . His most famous romance: Cliff Richard with Sue Barker in June 1982. He said later that he had seriously considered asking the tennis star to marry him . His £3million Algarve farm and his £6million plantation-style villa in Barbados are his pride and joy. He spends more time there than he does at the apartment that was raided yesterday, which he bought in 2008. He shrugged recently that he spends 'a week here, a week there' in Britain and it has been revealed that he is not even a UK resident any longer as he spends so little time in the country. He is domiciled instead in Barbados, where he spends each winter. That's not to say that he hasn't taken care over his home in Sunningdale. It is, like everything else in his life, very beautiful and done to his own particular tastes. As he was spending more and more time abroad, he decided in 2006 that he should move from his large home of three decades in St George's Hill, Weybridge, Surrey, to somewhere far smaller and requiring less upkeep. The former De Beers HQ where Sir Cliff owns a £3m apartment that was raided by police yesterday . Cliff Richard`s place in Sugar Hill, Barbados, where the Prime Minister Tony Blair and his family have stayed . Sir Cliff Richard's Vineyard and Holiday home on the Algarve in Portugal where he produces award-winning wines . Estate agents were told that he wanted somewhere 'opulent, secure and convenient'. At first he moved into an ugly yellow-brick bungalow on the Wentworth Estate, where his neighbours included entertainer Bruce Forsyth. But that was a temporary move, and he soon settled in the Charters building in Sunningdale, the former HQ of De Beers diamonds, now converted into luxury apartments. Cliff's £3million apartment is in the spectacular art deco mansion complex with its Portland stone columns and tall bronze-framed windows. The main house was built in 1938 by Frank Parkinson, a millionaire from Doncaster who had made his fortune in electrical motors. After the war it served as the headquarters for De Beers, before becoming a jumble of offices and factory units, until it was taken over by developer who converted it and two other buildings into apartments. The apartments all have marble floors and walls clad in walnut panelling. The kitchens are oak and chrome and the bathrooms granite, with heated floors. Huge plasma televisions are hidden behind mirrors. There is a spa, gym, tennis courts and a swimming pool. First love: The singer himself has acknowledged Carol Costa, the wife of his Shadows bandmate Jet Harris, as the only woman he has ever shared a bed with . Sir Cliff has had little cause to be displeased, except for a complaint that the gardens were not properly maintained at one time. He was spotted with a party of 11 friends and family at his local Indian restaurant, The Tiger's Pad, in Sunningdale, celebrating his 70th birthday in 2010. It was a typically down to earth choice for the singer, who is known for being cautious about money – except, perhaps, when it comes to property. Michael Ball of Savills, who sold the apartment to Sir Cliff, said at the time: 'About 85 per cent of our buyers have a second property abroad and are decanting from bigger houses in the area for something less onerous to run.' Love affairs: At 22, Sir Cliff had a passionate affair with actress Una Stubbs, then 24, (left) and has said that he came close to marrying Sue Barker (right) in the 1980s . In an interview with the Mail in 2011, Sir Cliff explained that despite the 'Peter Pan of Pop' image, he had been prompted to change his life as he was getting older and taking life a little easier. He said: 'It's a matter of having more time to myself and enjoying a more comfortable life. For instance, I used to take just three weeks' holiday a year. 'Now I go to Portugal for a couple of months to enjoy my farmhouse and vineyards there. I spend another couple of months at my house in Barbados, where the view over the Caribbean is to die for.' He has said that he will sell his Barbados home, where Tony and Cherie Blair have holidayed as guests, when he is 75 and move to a place with less demanding upkeep. Companion: Sir Cliff has described former Roman Catholic priest John McElynn (left) as a 'companion' and a 'blessing'. Mr McElynn manages the singer's property portfolio . He also has a home in New York. All his properties are managed by a former Roman Catholic priest, John McElynn, who has lived with him ever since his manager, Bill Latham, who shared his home for 30 years, moved out. Sir Cliff said: 'I can't stand travelling alone, eating alone, or being on my own. When Bill and I lived together, there was always speculation about our relationship, but nobody realised his girlfriend was living with us, too. They just thought, 'Uh-oh, two guys living together.' When Bill moved out, it was just because he and his girlfriend wanted to be alone together.' In 1993, he had told a South Bank Show special: 'If you're not married it doesn't mean you're gay. I'm happy, I'm settled but I'm not married.' Sir Cliff has had a handful of serious romances since losing his virginity at 18 to Carol Costa – who married Jet Harris, bass player in his backing band The Shadows. A biography said she was the only woman he has ever slept with. He said later: 'I loved Carol and there was a mutual physical attraction. She looked like Brigitte Bardot, who I had a thing about at the time. It turned out to be nothing very much at all and I made a big mistake.' After a romance with Australian dancer Delia Wicks in 1961, there a fling with actress Una Stubbs and a liaison with dancer Jackie Irving. The relationship with Miss Stubbs began on the set of his 1964 film Wonderful Life. Their brief romance was not revealed until two decades later, when both insisted it had amounted to nothing more than kissing, cuddling and holding hands. She said he was 'very important in my life and a very close friend ever since,' and he said: 'We loved each other madly, we had a romantic attachment, but it wasn't a sordid affair.' Most famously there was Cliff's romance in the Eighties with tennis player Sue Barker. In 2008 he told an interviewer: 'I seriously contemplated asking her to marry me, but in the end I realised that I didn't love her quite enough to commit the rest of my life to her.' Now, all that is in the past and Sir Cliff, worth £40million after more than 50 years in the business and 16 No 1 hits, has finally started slowing down – even though, to some extent, he remains financially anxious. 'I've never lost that basic human need to feel secure,' he said. 'I still wake up sometimes in a cold sweat, wondering if I've got enough.' His financial anxiety may partly be the result of his humble beginnings. He was born Harry Webb in Howra, outside Calcutta, in 1940. His parents came to England in 1948, and were described as destitute at first. Cliff and his sisters, Donna and Jacqui and Joan, lived in a single room in Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, while his father sought work. Sir Cliff has devoted his working life to finding homes where he is truly secure. After the events of yesterday, that security and comfort must suddenly feel a little precarious.

"Tossing pancakes on Sunday mornings helps David Cameron forget about the pressure of running the country. The Prime Minister said it is hard to ‘think too much about politics if you’re in danger of burning the pancakes’. He also revealed how he relies on a large entourage to do his job, is only allowed to listen to Bruce Springsteen if wife Samantha is away and suggested Wayne Rooney’s jitters at Manchester United developed after sitting next his mother, Mary, at a lunch. Scroll down for video . Foodie: David Cameron, pictured with a frying pan in 2006, revealed his love of making pancakes with his children . Music man: The PM, who visited a youth club in Wigan, revealed his music choices include Mumford & Sons and First Aid Kit . Mr Cameron has been plagued by allegations of ‘chillaxing’ when he should be running the country, from playing tennis at Chequers to becoming addicted to games on his iPad. Today he lifted the lid on another ritual in the Cameron household, this time rushing to escape burning political debate in the heat of the kitchen. Take part in a radio station Q&A session, he said his ‘perfect weekend’ is spent with his family in his West Oxfordshire constieuncy of Witney. He told Capital FM: ‘I love Sunday morning’s cooking pancakes with the children, it’s pretty messy but I love doing things like that. ‘I’ve got a nine-year-old, seven-year-old and a soon to be three-year-old, and doing things with them at the weekend is actually a great way of switching off. ‘It’s difficult to think too much about politics if you’re in danger of burning the pancakes.’ The admission immediately drew comparisons with Alfred the Great, who legend has it burnt cakes he was supposed to be watching in the home of a peasant woman in Somerset. Boss ban: The Prime Minister revealed he could only listen to Bruce Springsteen when wife Samantha was away because she ‘doesn’t like The Boss' The great mystery surrounding who advised Wayne Rooney to consider leaving Manchester United may have been solved - David Cameron's mum. The Prime Minister revealed how his mother sat next to the England striker at a lunch before Andy Murray's Wimbledon triumph last month. Mr Cameron was next to US golf champion Justin Rose, and was unable to hear what Rooney was discussing with Mrs Cameron. 'My mum sat next to Wayne Rooney and I was trying to listen in to that, because my mum she was a Magistrate for 40 years in Newbury, she’s not a big football fan. 'But, they seemed to be getting on fine, but I don’t know what advice she gave, maybe this is what set all this off.' Rooney trained with the reserves at Manchester United this morning. The England striker is determined to leave the Barclays Premier League for Premier League rivals Chelsea. In another insight into his private life,  Mr Cameron revealed his musical ‘guilt pleasure’ was listening to Bruce Springsteen. Mrs Cameron ‘doesn’t like The Boss’ so he can only listen to him when she is away. In 1985 he queued for hours to see Springsteen in France in ‘one of those concerts that went on for four hours. ‘That was my guilty pleasure. I queued for hours and I was right at the front and I just thought he was fantastic. ‘So, when Samantha is not around there is a little bit of Dancing in the Dark or something like that, or, Born in the USA, so that is my guilty…but actually I like his stuff like Nebraska and all the rather grim dark stuffy, so that is my guilty pleasure I suppose.’ The PM was challenged over the cost of . childcare, and how he has it easy compared to most working parents . juggling his job with family life. He admitted: ‘You’re completely right, . of course I have a busy life but I’ve got hundreds of people working . for me, arranging everything, you know, so I can concentrate on the job . in hand. ‘And, I know as a dad how difficult it . is in the holiday times trying to keep your children entertained and . also work at the same time, it’s incredibly difficult.’ Like all politicians desperate to . appeal for the youth vote, Mr Cameron was also at pains to burnish his . musical credentials, boasting of listening to Mumford and Sons, First . Aid Kit and Kurt Vile. Speaking on XFM he said he listens to most music on Spotify, but quickly insisted he pays the subscription service. ‘They’re having to work very hard all . these pop stars these days, because of Spotify and everything else there . are many more live appearances, many more festivals, it’s back to the . days of the wandering minstrel they’re having to really earn their . keep.’ Tour: Mr Cameron has spent the week visiting towns and cities across the country, including taking part in a game of table football during a visit to the Wigan Youth Zone boys and girls club . Mr Cameron later claimed he was ‘too busy getting on with the job to think’ about his legacy as Prime Minister. ‘What I want to do is get the country going in the right direction, get the deficit paid down, get the economy moving, get unemployment falling, get jobs for people. ‘But, I think as important as those sort of economic things is a sense of values, I think the most important thing is for people to feel that in Britain if you work hard and do the right thing you can succeed, you can get on, you can make something of your life.’","It's hard to think about politics while concentrating on cooking breakfast .

"Care Quality Commission chairman David Prior chose to have a private hip operation rather than face the three-month wait endured by health service patients. He has come under fire from patient groups who claims he has used a 'fast-track route reserved for those who can afford to pay' The head of the NHS watchdog chose to have a private hip operation rather than face the three-month wait endured by health service patients. David Prior, chairman of the Care Quality Commission, had the surgery paid for by his health insurance policy earlier this month. As well as bypassing NHS waiting times – which are the longest they have been for three years – he was given his own hospital room with en suite bathroom and TV. His decision provoked fury among patient groups last night, who said it was wrong for a top health official to take advantage of ‘a fast-track reserved for those able to pay’ while others were forced to wait months. They said Mr Prior’s choice to go private showed he had ‘no confidence’ in the hospitals his organisation has been charged with improving. Official figures this week showed that nearly three million patients are currently waiting for treatment – the highest number for six years – with the average delay for hip surgery more than three months. As a private patient, Mr Prior would have been able to have the operation almost as soon as he was referred by his GP. The 59-year-old would have benefited from additional nursing care in a wing partly reserved for private patients at the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital – where he was previously chairman. He would also have been able to personally choose his surgeon and consultant. Critics said his decision to have the operation privately was evidence of a ‘two-tier’ health system with those who could afford to  pay able to benefit from quicker, safer treatment. Dr Richard Taylor, co-leader of the National Health Action Party, said: ‘It’s remarkable that the man in charge of assessing the quality and safety of NHS services has just spurned a unique chance of assessing those services for himself from the patient’s point of view. ‘I don’t know the circumstances that influenced his decision to go private. But it appears to be further confirmation that this Government’s policy of running down and selling off our NHS is creating a two-tier service with the fast-track reserved for those able to pay.’ Julie Bailey, founder of Cure the NHS who helped expose the Mid Staffordshire scandal, said: ‘He should be ensuring our hospitals are safe, not going private. ‘He should be setting an example. It’s very disappointing and it’s sending out the wrong signal when the head of the NHS regulator feels he has to go private.’ Mr Prior is understood to have had his operation at the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital earlier this month. A CQC spokesman confirmed Mr Prior had used his health insurance to pay for the operation but denied he was treated on a private ward . John Mann, Labour MP for Bassetlaw in . Nottinghamshire, added: ‘It’s hardly a vote of confidence in the NHS. The person who regulates the NHS should be using the NHS and setting an . example to all the rest of us.’ In November the CQC’s annual report into the health service said it had found poor care in one in ten hospital inspections – and earlier this month Mr Prior admitted 30 hospitals were providing ‘c*** care.’ His private room and care after the operation would have ensured he was far less vulnerable to infections and conditions related to neglect, such as bedsores. Earlier this week figures from NICE showed that as many as one in 16 patients pick up an infection in hospital largely because staff are failing to follow basic hygiene measures such as washing their hands. A Labour source said: ‘Patients will be worried to learn that people who run the NHS don’t use it themselves. ‘They will see it as a sign that Prior has little confidence in the NHS, not least after his recent calls for privatisation.’ Since being appointed chairman of the watchdog in January last year, Mr Prior has been highly critical of the NHS and in particular hospital care. 'Patients will be worried to learn that people who run the NHS  don't use it themselves. They will see it as a sign that Prior has little confidence in the NHS, not least after his recent calls for privatisation' - Labour source . In December he said the health service had become ‘too powerful’ to be criticised and said certain areas were ‘out of control’. And earlier this month he said the care in 30 hospitals in England was dire and called for greater involvement of the private sector. Mr Prior – who earns £65,000 a year – is believed to have had his operation done at Norfolk and Norwich’s Cringleford Ward, as this is the only ward in the hospital designated for private patients, as well as teenagers and some NHS patients. It is not known which insurance firm he is covered by but the largest are BUPA, Prudential, Aviva and AXA PPP, with average annual premiums for a 50-something man ranging from £1,000 to £2,000. The watchdog chief, who is married and lives in London, was formerly a Tory MP for North Norwich and previously served as a director of a steel-making firm. He was chairman of Norfolk and Norwich NHS Trust from 2002 until he became chairman of the CQC. A spokesman for the watchdog said: ‘David Prior recently underwent a hip operation and subsequent hospital care at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital. ‘He was not treated in a private ward. He does, however, have private medical insurance and that insurance paid for his procedure and the subsequent care. ‘So he received NHS treatment, the cost of which will be recovered from his insurer.’ The spokesman later added that Mr Prior stayed in one of 12 single side rooms off the main ward.","Care Quality Commission chairman David Prior chose to go private .

"The Duchess of Cambridge couldn't help laughing today, after realising that she had been attempting to have a conversation with a young athlete who was wearing heavy-looking mask and unable to speak. Golfer Emma Allen, 17, from Southampton, was one of a group of athletes to be put through their paces in front of the Duchess as she toured the GSK Human Performance Lab in Brentford. Realising that Miss Allen was unable to reply, a clearly amused Duchess burst into laughter before getting the explanation she was looking for from one of the lab staff instead. Scroll down for video . Are you OK? The Duchess looks nonplussed as she spies Emma Allen from Southampton in a cumbersome looking face mask . Keep up the good work! A laughing Duchess then patted the budding golfer on the back as GSK technicians explained the test . On duty: The Duchess has recently recovered from a bout of severe morning sickness which kept her at home for almost two months . Afterwards, Miss Allen told of her meeting with the Duchess and described her as a 'wonderful figurehead'. ‘I know she is very sporty and loves her hockey,' she said. 'It’s wonderful to have a figurehead like her for me, especially as a girl. The facilities here are nothing like I have ever seen,' she continued. 'I never thought I would get the chance to experience something like this.’ Miss Allen's participation in the workshop had been organised by SportsAid, a charity that supports young athletes and aims to help them realise their potential - whether via funding or training. Kate, 32, who is around 16 weeks pregnant with her second child, is SportsAid's patron and in true sports-fanatic style, revealed that she was 'frustrated' at being unable to exercise because of her condition. Happily, organisers came to the rescue and, after being asked whether she wanted to try her hand at an exercise which tests mentality agility, she smiled broadly and said: ‘Finally, something I can do while I am pregnant!’ The Duchess, who was visiting the centre on behalf of SportsAid, which offers financial and practical assistance to young British athletes, pulled a face when she was told that recent participants included Formula One driver Jensen Button and triathletes the Brownlee brothers. ‘Hmmmm,’ she said, ‘no pressure then!’ Nice to meet you: The Duchess was all smiles as she toured the workshop which was being held by sports charity, SportsAid . Back on her feet: The Duchess of Cambridge showed barely a hint of a baby bump as she arrived to meet athletes in Brentford . Stylish: The sports-loving Duchess opted for a chic plum dress by British label Goat for the engagement . Kate was put through four tests of increasing difficulty by neuroscientist Barry O’Neill which involved her tapping coloured circles on a large screen. On one she was instructed to only press the green buttons and not red, on another to ignore verbal instructions to press one colour while tapping another. The sporty Duchess, a keen hockey and tennis player, has often admitted that she and her husband, Prince William, are fiercely competitive. And today she said wryly: ‘You should have my husband here.’ Wearing a plum £450 dress by British label Goat and kneehigh elasticated black boots, Kate squared up to the screen and, with both her arms outstretched and ready, she appeared to complete the task with ease. Afterwards, Mr O'Neill, 34, who was at pains to point out that he wasn't being rude, said that the Duchess had done well for 'a woman of her age'. ''She actually did very well for a woman of her age,' he explained. 'I'm not being rude, I must stress, but your reflexes do decrease every decade you age. 'Until now sports science has concentrated on what we call a headless approach. Concentrate on the body and leave the mind to somewhere else. We are trying to change that here. 'Jensen Button was here recently – he’s 34 – and completed the tests without a single mistake.' When this was explained to the Duchess, she seemed fascinated and said: 'It makes you wonder whether he is a good driver because he is so sharp mentally or whether the years of driving have honed it. 'It’s remarkable that people haven't really thought before of working the mind and body as one. This could be used in so many environments, even in an office. It is absolutely fascinating.' Having a go: The Duchess, whose baby bump was nowhere to be seen, stopped to try her hand at one of the tests . Having fun: Although now limited by her pregnancy, the Duchess is a keen sportswoman and adores sailing and rowing . Good reflexes: Unsurprisingly, the Duchess proved equal to the task and racked up an impressive score on the mental agility test . After being greeted as she arrived by Tim Lawler, chief executive of Sports Aid, and Charles Leslie, Global Head of the Human Performance Lab, the Duchess was introduced to some of the young athletes who were benefitting from a day’s workshop at the world class facilities. The teenagers, who have shown promise in sports as varied from swimming to the triathlon, golf and bobsleigh, have been described as some of the country’s ‘brightest hopes for the future’. Kate looked fascinated as she watched Sheikh Sheikh, 19, a wheelchair athlete, who was being put through his tests that focused on his core body temperature and heart rate compared to how hard he thought he was working. Multiple gold medal British Paralympic wheelchair athlete David Weir CBE explained to the Duchess what was happened. Afterwards, he said it was ‘fantastic’ that she was showing her support and said the financial help he had received from SportsAid had helped him enormously in the early stages of his career. Mr Sheikh was also left impressed by the royal visitor, saying afterwards that she had been 'very interested' in his progress. ‘She was somewhat apologetic watching me as I was working and seemed very interested in how the tests work,' he added. 'I felt very inspired by her visit.' Next on her tour was the Enviro Chamber, where several athletes, including 16-year-old golfer Marcus Penge, were training in 32 degree heat with 60 per cent humidity to recreate the conditions expected during the Rio Olympics in 2016. Meeting of minds: The Duchess of Cambridge meets wheelchair athlete Sheikh Sheikh during her visit to the Brentford lab . Pro: During the workshop, the Duchess stopped to chat with David Weir CBE, who has won the London Marathon an astonishing six times . Hard work: After his meeting with the Duchess, Mr Sheikh was put through his paces by GSK technicians . The pregnant Duchess visibly flinched at the oppressive heat. ‘Wow!’ she said. She expressed her surprise at how well the young sportsmen and women were doing in the conditions. ‘You seem super calm and relaxed, how on earth are you doing it?’ she asked. ‘It’s lovely to see experience the science behind everything. But I am sorry that we are all watching you have to go through this.’ Dr Ken van Someren, research and development director at the lab, who showed Kate round, said she seemed genuinely surprised at the sophistication of the equipment available to participants. ‘As we walked in she told me that she expected to see a small gym somewhere. She really didn't expect to see what we have here,’ he said. ‘She was particularly fascinated at the way we can apply what we discover about the athletes to help them improve.’ Sports Aid’s chief executive Tim Lawler agreed, adding: ‘She mentioned several times about how frustrated she was at not being able to get involved because of her pregnancy and made clear she would like to come back in the future. ‘The one thing that has emerged from her patronage is how much she wants to champion the athletes and their parents and she was fascinated to learn what just a small intervention like today early in their careers can mean for their aspirations and achievements.’ Glowing: The Duchess, who was pretty in a plum dress by British label Goat, showed off the barest hint of a baby bump . All together: The Duchess poses with a group of athletes determined to make it to Toyko 2020 during her visit to the GSK Lab . Established in 1976, SportsAid has helped many of the UK’s best-known sportsmen and women, including two-thirds of the British team at the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games and more than 450 British athletes who competed at Glasgow 2014. Support can include grants used for meeting essential costs such as travel, training, accommodation, competition fees and equipment but also workshop events such as today's. The Duchess of Cambridge has been Patron of SportsAid since 2013, reflecting her own passion for sport, in particular hockey, tennis, rowing and sailing. The GSK Human Performance Lab carries out research on elite performers – athletes, sports teams, extreme explorers – to better understand how the body and brain function. Kate's visit to Brentford comes in the middle of a busy run of engagements, who, with her husband, Prince William, will attend the Royal Variety Performance for the first time tomorrow night. On Sunday, she joined the Queen and the Duke of Cambridge at the Cenotaph for the Remembrance Sunday service and has turned out at a number of events since overcoming severe morning sickness, most notably, at the state welcome for Singaporean president Tony Tan late last month.

"A Virginia mom has come to believe the ghost of a US Marine who was killed over 30 years ago in a terror attack is somehow now possessing her four-year-old son. Michele Lucas of Virginia Beach claims her son Andrew has been recalling the story of Sgt. Val Lewis, a soldier who died in the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing. Lucas told WTKR-TV it started when the toddler began talking about things no child his age should, beginning with saying he used to live at 860 Main Street in Sumter, Georgia. Lucas began researching herself but couldn't work out what Andrew was talking to, however the behavior only increased. Scroll down for video . Spirit within: Andrew Lucas, of Virginia Beach, is being haunted by the spirit of a fallen U.S. Marine, according to his mom. The four-year-old has been reliving the soldier's death . Scared: Michele Lucas says she's searching for answers for her son's strange behavior, including asking her why she let him die in a fire . Connected?: Sgt. Val Lewis (left) died in the Beirut barracks bombing in October 1983. Virginia Beach boy Andrew Lucas has been recounting details of the Marine's death recently, his mother claims . She started suspecting there was a spirit living inside her son, she told WTKR, and reached out to the creators of television show Ghost Inside My Child. 'He just starts crying hysterically and I say “What’s wrong Andrew?” and he says, “Why did you let me die in that fire?' Lucas told the station. The show producers investigated further and apparently connected the things Andrew was saying with the story of Sgt. Lewis, using the address and the fire. The Beirut barrack bombings killed over 300 people, including 241 American servicemen - among them Sgt. Lewis - during the Lebanese Civil War. They showed the boy pictures of Sgt. Lewis and some of his Marine friends, who Andrew seemed to recognize and was able to talk about. Closure: Andrew's parents believed taking him to visit the grave site of Sgt. Lewis may help him find closure, however they say his behavior was just as strange . Lucas decided to take her son to the Georgia gravesite of Sgt. Lewis in the hope it might bring him some closure. She said he walked straight up to the headstone and placed flowers atop of it, before taking off for another grave nearby, which he said was one of his friends. The strange occurrences continued when the family returned to Virginia Beach. 'About two weeks ago, there was an emblem on my wall and it was like somebody went up to it and turned it, and it went right back,' Lucas told WTKR. Scene: Michele Lucas is now wondering if her Virginia Beach house is haunted . Odd: The toddler's behavior has been frightening his mother, who suspects something supernatural . 'So it’s kind of creeping me out. 'I don’t know if I’ve picked up spirits while I was in the graveyard. 'I don’t know.' Lucas said her next step is to see a psychic, hoping they will able to give her better answers. 'Is my house haunted? Is my child haunted?' she said.

"This is the shocking moment a crazed commuter launched an apparently random attack on a woman - pushing her on to the tracks of the London Underground. The 23-year-old victim struck up a brief conversation with the thug and following a trivial row over the man's hat, he turned and shoved her on to the rails on the Northern Line at Leicester Square. She only missed the live rail by inches, and was able to pull herself back onto the platform with the help of other travellers before the next train came down the platform. Injuries to her side were so severe, witnesses initially thought she had been stabbed. Scroll down for video . Tipping point: The vicious and dangerous attack was allegedly sparked by a 'trivial' row about the man's hat . Dangerous: The man, in a fit of rage, violently shoves the woman onto the northbound Northern Line track . The attacker risked his victim's life in two ways: She could have been electrocuted by the track's live middle wire, or she could have been hit by an oncoming train . The incident - highlighted on the BBC's six-part The Tube documentary on Monday night - shows the very real dangers faced by commuters and staff each day. British Transport Police are still hunting the man behind the vicious assault, describing him as smartly dressed. They said the incident stemmed from a short argument about the attacker's hat. The incident took place on Friday, September 16, at about 11.20pm, but police are so keen to find the man they have re-appealed again for more information on the back of the BBC's documentary. Do you know this man? British Transport Police are keen to trace the suspect . The girl is comforted seconds after the incident: The BBC were filming in the station at the time of the attack . Treatment: The woman is removed by paramedics following the attack .

BTP Detective Sergeant Fin Egan, the . investigating officer, said: 'This was a dangerous and reckless act . which could have had grave consequences had a Tube train been . approaching. 'The victim suffered a nasty cut to her side as she landed on the rails, but was able to pull herself back up onto the platform.

"There cannot have been many sportsmen who have risen as spectacularly as Moeen Ali and then been heartily booed by the bulk of his home crowd at the end of a breakthrough summer. But, then again, Moeen is no ordinary cricketer. The Birmingham born-and-bred and very British Muslim did not expect the torrent of abuse he received at Edgbaston from the Indian supporting majority of the sell-out crowd when he played for England in their Twenty20 international. After all, he was coming to the end of a season which saw him emerge as not only one of the most exciting talents in the English game but also the perfect role model for British Asians from similar inner-city backgrounds. England all-rounder Moeen Ali expressed his disappointment at being booed in Birmingham over the summer . Yet the sheer scale of the booing, greater than that received by any other English cricketer with an Asian background and predominantly because of his Pakistani heritage, was evidence that he has much to do to convince those like him to follow him and embrace the domestic game. ‘I won’t say that it hurt but it was disappointing that I live 10 minutes from Edgbaston and I’m getting booed by people I feel I’m supposed to represent,’ said Moeen at Lord’s as he prepared to join England’s one-day tour of Sri Lanka. ‘People have a right to support who they want, of course, but it was a big shame but I’m hoping in the future maybe they or their kids will become England fans or players. It just made me feel that a lot more work needs to be done.’ If Moeen was not hurt by the reception then his father Munir, himself born in Birmingham and a tireless worker for disadvantaged youngsters in the area through his academy, certainly was. ‘My dad was very upset because it was the first time the family had watched me play for England at Edgbaston,’ said Moeen. ‘I don’t know what it was. Maybe because my family are from Kashmir. I actually think alcohol played a large part but I’ll never forget it and I was just glad to field the last ball when we won.’ So what more can be done to convince more British Asians to support the country of their birth? ‘I’ve thought about it and I think players like myself and Ravi Bopara need to get out there and tell people that it is about playing for our country and that means playing for England. Ali revealed that his dad was 'very upset' at the abuse he received from those in the Midlands . ‘Sometimes in Asian homes it is about where we’ve come from, which is important too, but it is about where you live and where you’re born and the people who are the same as you. The thing is, when you play in India they cheer everybody and I’ve had Indian friends sort of apologise to me about what happened. But there’s definitely more that people like me can do.’ Another controversy to affect Moeen last summer was his decision to wear pro-Palestinian wristbands during England's Test against India at Southampton, a move which led to him being ticked off by the ICC. Ali is set to star for England at February's World Cup . 'I still have my views and opinions but I must be more wary of expressing them on the field,' said Moeen. 'I still believe what I believe in. I auctioned the wristbands. A guy paid £500 for them for the charity of his choice and I had dinner with him in Birmingham. I was pleased some good came out of it.' He has done quite a lot already both on and off the field, not least in impressing with bat, notably a maiden Test century of rare class against Sri Lanka, and with the ball in taking 19 wickets in the 3-1 success against India. Now he is part of an England squad that leave for Sri Lanka on Sunday for a seven-match 50-over series that serves as a warm-up for a World Cup in Australia and New Zealand in the New Year that few expect them to thrive in. Moeen believes that England can exceed expectations by abandoning the traditional cautious mind-set and replacing it with a fearless approach. ‘I know a lot of people are writing us off but I feel we have a good chance because of the amount of one-day cricket we are now playing before then. ‘I didn’t play in the first three games of our series against India so I watched the way they batted and the biggest thing I got out of that was how fearless they were. They just went out and backed themselves and you could see a massive difference in the way they batted compared to us. They really express themselves and that’s what we need to do too.’ Moeen, 27, is a candidate to bat at three in Sri Lanka and the World Cup or fill an all-rounder’s role at seven but what he would really like is to go in at the very top. ‘I’d love to open,’ said Moeen, who could become an alternative to Alex Hales as Alastair Cook’s partner if the big-hitting Notts man does not come off. ‘I’ve done that for much of my career at Worcester. I know there are people who have opened longer than me with better records but that’s my long-term aim.’ When Moeen burst on to the scene post England’s Ashes disaster much was made of his ability as an off-spinner to bowl the doosra, the ball that goes away from the right-hander, but it was rarely seen while he was bamboozling India and now he has reluctantly put it back in his locker, probably for good. Ali impressed hugely with the ball during a summer of ups and downs for Peter Moores' England . VIDEO Ali targets ODI place . A crackdown on unorthodox actions by the International Cricket Council has seen a number of spinners, notably Moeen’s mentor Saeed Ajmal, banned from bowling and the all-rounder does not want to risk going the same way. ‘I’m not going to bowl it because of the scrutiny,’ said Moeen, who confounded suggestions that he was only a ‘part-time’ spinner throughout his fruitful summer. ‘I don’t want to risk not playing for England because of that. ‘It’s a shame because personally I feel it is a great skill to turn the ball both ways as an off-spinner and I always thought the doosra was a great innovation but I don’t want to be banned. At the moment I don’t feel I need it anyway.’ Not if he carries on as he has done this year he won’t. And maybe it he does then even his home crowd will cheer Moeen Ali. *Investec, the specialist bank and asset manager, is the title sponsor of Test cricket in England.

"Mesut Ozil's relationship with his own father may have been destroyed by a legal battle. Mustafa Ozil had taken the Mesut Ozil Marketing Company to court, demanding £495,000 in lost earnings on sponsorship deals. Son Mesut responded by demanding the return of an £800,000 loan. The case was eventually settled outside of court last month, but the Dusseldorf state court only confirmed the settlement this week. His bother Mutlu has been taking care of Mesut's affairs for the past year. Mesut Ozil is currently on the sidelines at Arsenal, possibly ruled out for the rest of 2014 . Ozil's new representative is brother Mutlu . Until last year, Mustafa Ozil has been his son's agent, as well as an executive at the 'Mesut Ozil Marketing Company'. In the summer of 2013, Mustafa not only negotiated his son's move from Real Madrid to Arsenal, but also a multi-million pound sponsorship deal with adidas. The relationship between father and son broke down shortly afterwards, however, with Mesut Ozil apparently dismayed at the manner in which his parents had split up. The Germany player sacked his father, taking on his brother Mutlu as his new agent. Mustafa was also at the heart of his son's messy exit from Real Madrid, launching into a vicious war of the words with Real president Florentino Perez in September 2013. Real accused Ozil and his father of greed, while Mustafa insisted that Perez was 'not an honourable man'. Some speculated that the ensuing chaos around Mesut Ozil's person may have been a reason for his dip in confidence towards the turn of the year. Mustafa Ozil, though, has found his own reasons. In an interview with the Cologne newspaper 'Express' this week, he has claimed that it was Mesut's girlfriend, Mandy Capristo, who destroyed the relationship between father and son. Mustafa claims Mesut's girlfriend at the time Mandy Capristo drove the father and son apart . Mesut Ozil poses with German president Joachim Gauck and Chancellor Angela Merkel . 'His girlfriend at the time put herself between father and son. She made Mesut crazy', he said. Whatever the reason, contact between Mesut Ozil and his father is said to have been minimal in the last year, with their relationship at rock bottom. 'It's nothing new to us that there are problems between Mesut and his father,' Germany's General Manager Oliver Bierhoff told Express, 'but Mesut always puts private issues to the side. He never talks to us about them.' Ozil Marketing refused to comment when contacted by MailOnline. Like our Arsenal Facebook page.

"Retired Germany keeper Tim Wiese is set to make his debut with the WWE on Saturday in Frankfurt as the 32-year-old pursues his goal to become a  professional wrestler. Wiese, who's taken up body building since being released by the Bundesliga's Hoffenheim in January, has caught the eye of the sport and entertainment hybrid's top brass. And Bild reports the six times-capped international will be introduced to wrestling fans at the WWE Live event this weekend at the Festhalle Frankfurt. Ripped former Germany keeper Tim Wiese will appear at WWE Live in Frankfurt on Saturday . Wiese (left), who's retired from the Bundesliga and pursuing a wrestling career, poses with Wolfburg's Naldo . While the German paper says no contract has been signed between Wiese and the WWE and he won't be taking the ring in anger. Instead, his celebrity in his homeland will be used as a 'taster act' between bouts. Wiese cuts an imposing figure with his 6ft 3in frame now boasting the muscle mass to more than match the likes of current superstars John Cena and Brock Lesner. ‘I got an official request from the WWE,' he told Bild in September. ‘It’s for a commitment from me to become a pro wrestler. I’ll listen to everything on it’s own merits. ‘Why should I say no? Wrestling is very popular especially in the United States. I will discuss the offer in the next few weeks with my agent. I am not scared.’ Wiese played just 10 times for Hoffenheim between 2012-2014 before being released in January . WWE superstar John Cena awaits Wiese in the ring should his big move come to fruition . Before Wiese could join the upper echelons of the WWE, it's been said he would need a year's training to get up to speed with their risky manouvres and showmanship. Wiese spent the majority of his football career at Werder Bremen (194 appearances), where he played in the Champions League, after stints at Fortuna Koln and Kaiserslautern, and was part of Germany's 2010 World Cup squad. He played just 10 times for Hoffenheim between 2012 and 2014.","Tim Wiese took up bodybuilding after leaving Bundesliga in January .

"When Kim Kardashian launched her latest magazine covers on an unsuspecting world this morning she had one wish, to break the internet. We’d reason that she’s not far off. Not only have the two images of her taken for Paper magazine gone completely viral, one of them had over half a million Instagram likes in just nine hours. The image was instantly compared to the iconic Grace Jones Island Life cover, and memes of her bum and lists written of things her bum looks like soon followed. Scroll down for video . Kim Kardashian wants to break the internet, with a bum like hers she'd be hard pressed not to. The pictures were shot by famous photographer Jean-Paul Gaude . Who can forget her #belfie? Kim sparked a huge amount of copycat posts when she instagrammed a picture of her post baby body in a white swimsuit . Kim's pictures have been compared to this famous Grace Jones Island Life cover which was also shot by Jean-Paul Goude . Proud husband Kanye West shared the magazine covers with a simple caption . Even Kim's husband Kanye West couldn't resist sharing the new pictures of his wife, posting them to Twitter with the simple caption '#ALLDAY'. Indeed, if this reaction is anything to go by it’s safe to say we’re all pretty bottom crazy. But Kim's isn't the only behind we're obsessed with. Ever since the nineties there has been explosion of love for shapely bottoms. From Kylie Minogue’s extremely pert glutes in THOSE gold hotpants in the ‘Spinning Around’ video to J-Lo’s most famous ass-et we just can’t get enough. Such big business are these bums that Kim K is rumoured to have insured hers for £13million. Although that doesn’t mean she knows what all the fuss is about. She once said, ‘I don’t get the fact, like, why it’s talked about. I don’t get it. Sometimes I get bored of talking about it… Most women have one.’ Who could forget those gold hot-pants? Kylie Minogue set pulses racing in her Spinning Around video . Jennifer Lopez places a friendly hand on Iggy Azalea's famous bottom, earlier this year they recorded a song together called 'Booty' all about big bums . Look at her butt! Nicki Minaj released Anaconda earlier this year, in the very raunchy video she showed off her large bottom . Kim regularly wears tight clothes and dresses which show off her curvaceous bottom . When Pippa Middleton was bridesmaid for her sister Kate all anyone could talk about was her bottom . And when Pippa Middleton played bridesmaid to her sister Kate in 2012, her bum was nearly more talked about than the Royal wedding itself. At the time Debenhams reported that they had seen a massive surge in shaping underwear with women seeking enhance their bottoms. Stars such as Jennifer Lopez, Nicki Minaj and Iggy Azalea are all also known for showing off there buttocks. And people like Beyonce aren't afraid to admit they put the hard work in, ‘I guess my butt is natural. But I go through stages like every woman. I like being curvy but sometimes I get curvy in the wrong places,' she once said. ‘After New Year I do stairs - they are the best thing for butt cheeks. Every January I'll start working out. I'll do that for three months and then stop again!’ According to the history books our obsession with all things derriere was going on long before Kim K and her perfectly rounded, perfectly oiled posterior showed up. In fact it dates all the way back to 24000BC when statues such as the Venus de Villendorf were created with large shapely bottoms and thick thighs. It is thought the fascination stems from our inbuilt need to procreate; a rounder bottom indicates a wider pelvic area which is recognised as a sign of good fertility. Although we’re not sure that anyone looking at Kim K’s bottom today is thinking about how big her pelvis is… . The Venus de Villendorf is a prime example of how early the obsession with buns began as it dates back to around 24000BC . The Venus Callipyge which stands in the National Archaeological Museum, Naples is famous because it shows its subject revealing her 'beautiful buttocks' From then on images of the buttocks could be seen and revered throughout history. The Venus Callipyge,which literally translates to, ‘Venus of the beautiful buttocks,’ is thought to be of Greek origin, created in the 1st of 2nd century BC. It depicts a woman lifting her gown to show off her shapely bottom, furthermore Michelangelo’s David is said to have one of the most recognisable bums in the world. Francis Boucher's, ‘L’Odalisque Brune,’ or ‘Brown Odalisk shows a woman reclining on a bed with her bottom clearly on show . Edgar Degas created a series of paintings which shows naked dancers drying and preening themselves after they had bathed . Similarly French painters throughout the ages have focused their work on bottoms. Francis Boucher painted, ‘L’Odalisque Brune,’ or ‘Brown Odalisk,’ in 1745 showing a woman reclining on a bed with a sheet only covering the top part of her body. In around 1895 Edgar Degas similarly focused on the bottom in a series of paintings of dancers drying themselves off after bathing including one called, 'After the bath, woman drying herself.' In all of the pictures the artist focused on the back of the women rather than the front. Marilyn Monroe was famed for her curvy body which she loved to show off in a variety of swimming costumes . The popularity of the bottom went on throughout the 20th century with film stars such as Marilyn Monroe and Bridgette Bardot setting hearts racing with their curvy figures. Then in the 1970’s the Athena Tennis Girl poster which showed a young woman on a tennis court lifting up her skirt to reveal her bottom to the camera sold a massive two million copies. The photograph starred Fiona Butler, who was 18 at the time, the picture had been taken by her then boyfriend Martin Elliot who had sold the photo to the poster company.","Images of buttocks have been popular since 24000BC .

"Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling has praised Brendan Rodgers for helping him become a better player during his time at Anfield. The 19-year-old has quickly become an integral part of Rodgers' first-team and played a key role as the Reds narrowly missed out on the Premier League title last season. And Sterling, who is currently training with England ahead of Saturday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia, believes his manager has been a major factor in his development.

'The best piece of advice I've been given is to live, eat and sleep football. It was great advice given to me by the manager, and it has helped me going forward.' Sterling is yet to win silverware with Liverpool or England but he has his sights firmly set on success for club and country over the next five years.

"There are a handful of apps that claim to be able to monitor and identify signs of skin cancer, but the latest may be the most scientifically accurate to date. SkinVision uses an algorithm that was developed over two years, using 4,000 images from 500 live dermatological evaluations - and has an accuracy of up to 90 per cent. Its makers stress that the app doesn't offer a full diagnosis, and shouldn't replace medical advice, but it can identify skin lesions as high risk if they show signs associated with the disease. Scroll down for video . SkinVision uses an algorithm that was developed using 4,000 images from 500 live dermatological evaluations - and has an accuracy of up to 90%, compared to official medical results for the same lesions.  Its makers stress it doesn't offer a diagnosis, but can identify lesions as high risk if they show signs of disease . SkinVision was designed to help users keep track of their moles and learn how at risk they are from melanoma skin cancer using photos of their lesions. Once an image has been uploaded, a mathematical algorithm analyses it and provides a risk classification. If it detects characteristics that could potentially indicate ‘abnormal or dangerous’ skin growth, the app will display a warning. There are three types of lesions analysed by the SkinVision app. High-risk lesion: This lesion should be seen by a specialist immediately in order to establish if an excision is necessary. Medium-risk lesion: This lesion should be tracked closely to determine if changes occur and your dermatologist should be aware of it. Low-risk lesion: No immediate action is required, however a medical opinion at some point is always recommended. If the app detects characteristics that could potentially indicate ‘abnormal or dangerous’ skin growth, it will display a warning. Medium and high-risk patients are then given details of nearby dermatologists and doctors through the app. Users can additionally track how their moles evolve over time. The algorithm was developed by a team of board-certified dermatologists, including Kostas Konstantinos and Cristina Cotruță, mathematicians and image analysis experts. Its skin pattern recognition is based on fractal analysis, which calculates patterns and dimensions of both a skin lesion and its surrounding tissue. By calculating the fractal dimension of both the skin and the lesion, the analysis algorithm detects any abnormal growth patterns, or behaviour. Over 4,000 images were reviewed and peer reviewed by dermatologists, and more than 500 live patients were assessed to establish the basis of the algorithm. The algorithm is also involved in clinical studies to compare it to a dermatologist’s evaluation of the same lesion and dermoscopy results. When compared to the live evaluations, the algorithm matched the results and was accurate in 74 per cent of cases. This rose to 90 per cent sensitivity when compared to demoscopy results. Its skin pattern recognition is based on fractal analysis, which calculates the patterns and dimensions of both a skin lesion and its surrounding tissue (pictured). By calculating the fractal dimension of both the skin and the lesion, the analysis algorithm detects any abnormal growth patterns, or behaviour . But its makers stress it is not a substitute for medical advice, and concerned users should always get skin lesions checked out by a professional. As a result, users are directed towards nearby dermatologists and doctors through the app. ‘Skin conditions, in general and skin cancer (melanoma in particular), almost always have a cause related to lifestyle,’ said the firm. The app costs £2.99 in the UK and $4.99 in the US, plus a monthly subscription starting at £2.99 ($4.99) for one month, up to £17.49 ($28) for a year . ‘[Our] goal is to help change those lifestyles so that more people stay healthy and the ones that need treatment receive it in time.’ The app costs £2.99 in the UK and $4.99 in the US, plus a monthly subscription starting at £2.99 ($4.99) for one month, up to £17.49 ($28) for a year. A nevus is a benign, or non-cancerous, melanocytic tumor, more commonly called a mole. The majority of moles will never cause problems, but atypical or ‘dysplastic’ moles have a higher risk of developing melanoma - the most aggressive form of skin cancer. About 65 per cent of melanoma cases can be attributed to ultraviolet radiation from the sun. In addition, SkinVision also tracks local UV exposure, on a daily basis, to help users learn more about the dangers and the risks. ‘SkinVision does not intend to provide medical advice or replace a dermatologist’s opinion,’ said Mr Konstantinos. ‘It does not provide information on whether the mole is a malignant melanoma or a benign pigmented lesion. ‘This is why risk classifications that SkinVision provides, always carry an element of physician referral. ‘Through skin type assessment and behavioural data, SkinVision offers tools that allow users to better understand and track their skin health, bring more fact-based information to their next GP or dermatologist visit and make healthy skin part of their day-to-day lifestyle,’ said the firm. Matt Gass from the British Association of Dermatologists told MailOnline: 'Anything that encourages people to examine their skin is welcome, however apps purporting to provide a treatment or diagnosis should be looked at with a high degree of caution. 'There is a real danger that not only will un-evaluated mole screening apps over-diagnose, but that they may also under-diagnose and falsely reassure the customer, who then does not seek referral for a changing mole. 'Any commercial mole checking devices, particularly those as accessible as apps, must be scientifically evaluated before they can be considered safe. 'Any new device to help distinguish worrying moles from harmless moles should be subject to rigorous assessment and evaluation. 'The danger is that commercial incentives will get in the way of patient safety and good medicine.'","SkinVision was designed to help users keep track of skin lesions, or moles .

"Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge has declared himself 'happy to be back' as he steps up his anticipated return from a long injury lay-off. The 24-year-old has not featured for the Reds since August 31 after a thigh strain sustained on England duty was followed by a calf problem picked up in his first session back with his club. Having spent last week finishing off his rehabilitation sessions at Melwood the striker has now returned to training, although with most of the first-team squad away with their national teams, he will not be involved in a proper full session until next week. Daniel Sturridge (left) congratulates Alberto Moreno on his goal at Tottenham, with the 3-0 win at White Hart Lane at the end of August proving to be his last game in a Liverpool shirt before picking up an injury . Sturridge has missed Liverpool's last 14 games through injury as he looks on from the stands during Chelsea's 2-1 Premier League win at Anfield on Saturday . Sturridge has scored one goal this season, on the opening day in a 2-1 win over Southampton . 'Training was class. Happy to be back,' Sturridge tweeted on Wednesday, having written on social media after Saturday's defeat to Chelsea he was 'looking forward to returning to full training next week'. After missing 14 matches for Liverpool the England forward is targeting a return to action when the Premier League resumes after the current break with the match at Crystal Palace on Sunday November 23. 'I'll be ready for that one, God willing,' Sturridge told BT Sport at the weekend. 'It's the worst feeling to be honest but that's football. Everyone picks injuries up.' During the time Sturridge has been sidelined the Reds have won just five games - two of those in the Capital One Cup - and lost seven. Sturridge hasn't played since featuring for 89 minutes in England's 1-0 friendly win over Norway in September . Sturridge assesses a thigh injury picked up while training with England at St George's Park which has led to him missing much of Liverpool's season so far . Their Premier League record during that spell shows five defeats and only eight goals in seven matches as summer signings Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert have failed to fill the void. That has seen Brendan Rodgers' side drop to 11th in the table, 15 points behind unbeaten leaders Chelsea but still only four points off a Champions League qualification place - which remains their primary target having got back among Europe's elite with their runners-up finish to Manchester City last season. Sturridge's return will be a welcome boost for Rodgers as his side seek to regain their cutting edge but former Liverpool winger Steve McManaman believes they should not put too much pressure on the striker to start delivering immediately. 'Daniel Sturridge is hopefully going to be fit and raring to go (soon) and you hope Liverpool can replicate the kind of form they displayed at Tottenham away when they won really easily against a good team,' he told liverpoolfc.com. 'It'll have a positive impact because he's a very good footballer who scored lots of goals last year, but he'll need time to get himself fully fit and well.'

"Tomas Berdych bounced back from a poor start to his ATP World Tour Finals campaign by beating out-of-form Marin Cilic in straight sets on Wednesday. Berdych had won just two games in his opening match against Stan Wawrinka on Monday but was in far better form as he beat Cilic 6-3, 6-1 in one hour and 14 minutes. The Czech now goes top of Group A for a brief period, with the winner of Wednesday night's match between Wawrinka and Novak Djokovic guaranteed to overtake him.

Cilic, pictured here playing a backhand, has now lost his opening two group games in London . Like Berdych, Cilic had only managed to claim two games in his opener against Djokovic and the Croat also admitted prior to the tournament that he had still not fully recovered from a right arm injury. The first game was packed with unforced errors from both but Berdych still managed to claim the instant break as Cilic netted with a forehand. US Open champion Cilic continued to struggle and Berdych broke again to wrap up the first set in 42 minutes. Things got no better for Cilic in the second set as he misfired with a backhand to hand the break to Berdych for 3-1. Berdych can qualify for the semi-finals of the ATP World Tour Finals if he beats Novak Djokovic this week .

Australian Open champion Wawrinka will now take to the court later knowing that victory will book his semi-final place, while world No 1 Djokovic cannot guarantee qualification tonight even if he wins.

"A high school football star who was a passenger in his mother's car has died after she tried to pass another vehicle but lost control and  slammed into trees. Branden Denis, 16, and his mother's boyfriend, 35-year-old dad-of-three Eric Morey, were both pronounced dead at the scene of the crash in Bridgton, Maine at 5.50pm on Sunday. But his mother, 34-year-old Candice Tucker, survived the wreck with minor injuries and is in fair condition in Maine Medical Center in Portland, the Portland Press Herald reported. Police said that it appears excessive speed contributed to the crash. It is not yet known if they were wearing seatbelts and there is no word yet on whether Tucker will face charges. Tragic: Branden Denis, pictured left, was killed after his mother, Candice Tucker, right, allegedly lost control of their car and crashed into trees on Sunday. She escaped with minor injuries but her boyfriend also died . At Gorham High School on Monday, football teammates and staff paid tribute to the starting lineman, remembering him as a devoted, hardworking team player and a gentle giant. Before football practice on Monday, some teammates put Denis' number, 64, in athletic tape on the locker room door, while others displayed his jersey and football cleats. The boys entered school with mixed emotions, the Press Herald reported; just two days before the crash, the team had won its first game in more than two years. 'Branden was an old fashioned Maine boy,' Football coach Andy Hager told WMTW. 'He worked as hard as he could every single day he showed up every single day. He encouraged everyone . Loved: Friends and family remembered Branden, 16, as a gentle giant who loved football and hunting . Tribute: Members of the football team made a shrine featuring his jersey, cleats and helmet at school . 'He never put a single person down and was someone everyone rallied behind...

She later faced charges of driving on a revoked license and later was charged with driving an uninspected vehicle, records show. She has also been involved in two crashes - including when she improperly passed another vehicle in 2005, although no one was hurt. She was charged in that incident with leaving the scene of an accident and driving on a suspended license.","Branden Denis and his mother's boyfriend, dad-of-three Eric Morey, were killed in the car crash in Bridgton, Maine on Sunday afternoon .

"A former TV pitchman in Utah with a history of running afoul of the law was charged Tuesday with two federal misdemeanors by prosecutors who say he chased a barn owl in flight on his motorized paraglider. Dell 'Super Dell' Schanze is accused of knowingly using an aircraft to harass wildlife and pursuing a migratory bird, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Utah. The charges come after a federal investigation into an online video that surfaced last year and appeared to show a paraglider near Utah Lake kicking a soaring owl and boasting, 'I kicked an owl butt.' Under fire: Dell 'Super Dell' Schanze is accused of knowingly using an aircraft to harass wildlife and pursuing a migratory bird, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Utah . Prosecutors say the 45-year-old Schanze's flight happened in February or March of 2011, and would constitute a violation of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. No hearings were immediately scheduled in the case, and no attorney was listed for Shanze. He could not be reached for comment. The harassment charge carries a penalty of up to one year in jail and a $100,000 fine, while the other charge could lead to six months in jail and a $5,000 fine. It also calls on Schanze to forfeit his paraglider. Schanze is known in Utah for his over-the-top personal style and the shrill, hyperactive TV commercials that advertised his one-time Totally Awesome Computers retail chain. He shut down the stores in 2006 amid sinking sales and legal troubles. In the years since, he has run for political office, including a Libertarian bid for governor.

Five years later, he was arrested in Oregon in connection with a jump off the 125-foot-tall Astoria Column and said outside the jail the government was stifling his creativity. He's also had other legal troubles, including a 2005 conviction for lying to officers after prosecutors said he brandished a gun at Draper residents angry that he'd sped through their neighborhood. He was sentenced to 10 days in jail four years later, after police stopped him for weaving in and out of traffic. Prosecutors say his children weren't wearing seatbelts and Schanze was carrying a loaded gun in his fanny pack without a permit.","Dell 'Super Dell' Schanze, 45, is known in Utah for his over-the-top personal style and the shrill, hyperactive TV commercials .

"The BBC is helping dozens of its top stars to avoid paying full income tax. It employs the TV and radio presenters through ‘personal service companies’ that allow them to minimise their contributions to the Exchequer. The deals also allow the corporation to sidestep millions of pounds in national insurance. Worrying: The BBC is helping dozens of its top stars to avoid paying full income tax, it has emerged . In a grilling by MPs yesterday, BBC finance chief Zarin Patel admitted that 148 of the broadcaster’s 467 presenters – nearly a third – were paid ‘off the books’. Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said the scale of the legal tax dodge was shocking. ‘The BBC is funded through the taxpayer and licence fee. It makes it entirely unacceptable for anybody to be on a contract that is in any way avoiding tax,’ added the Labour MP. Last night Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs announced it would step up its investigations into personal service companies. The BBC insisted the arrangements were standard industry practice but yesterday agreed to review how it pays its big names. The 148 stars are among 25,000 freelance contractors working for the corporation. Concerns: Dozens of household names - thought to include Jeremy Paxman, left, and Fiona Bruce, right, are employed through one-man-band companies, which can minimise their tax bills . Mrs Hodge said it was wrong that the BBC allowed tax arrangements that did not seem ‘morally right’. She . rejected the idea that the stars were freelances, adding: ‘A lot of . people I think are probably on these contracts are the face of the BBC . and therefore to pretend that they are anything other than pretty . permanent features on our television screens and on the radio is pretty . naive.’ Controversial: In a grilling by MPs yesterday, BBC finance chief Zarin Patel, pictured, admitted that 148 of the broadcaster's 467 presenters, nearly a third,  were paid 'off the books' Dozens of . household names are employed through the one-man-band companies, which . both minimise their tax bills and let bosses off the hook for national . insurance contributions. Stars benefiting are thought to include Jeremy Paxman and Fiona Bruce. They have set up companies through which they channel their earnings. Instead of paying the 50p top tax rate they can, with careful financial planning, get away with a lower corporation tax rate. Someone with a personal services company would be liable to corporation tax of 20 per cent on profits of up to £300,000 in a tax year. Above this profits are taxed at up to 24 per cent. The BBC is accused of encouraging the arrangement because it pays less national insurance. The practice also means that thousands of freelancers who do not have glamorous jobs or high wages are not afforded the same protection, holiday or sick pay as full employees. Miss Patel, whose pay packet of £337,000 a year is more than double the Prime Minister’s, argued that the BBC’s use of freelancers was ‘custom’ in the industry. Freelancers were paid a higher rate than staff, usually, to reflect that they had to pay their own tax and national insurance. To the incredulity of the committee, Miss Patel denied that the BBC was trying to reduce its tax bill through the arrangements. ‘I . emphasise that none of this is designed to avoid tax. That is not why . we use an extensive number of freelance contracts at the BBC,’ she . insisted. Miss Patel did agree to a demand from MPs to review the way it employs its workers, however, and admitted that there seemed to be serious concerns. She said 12,000 interim staff were on the low-tax contracts. Mrs Hodge revealed that one long-term presenter was threatened by the BBC with a very substantial pay cut unless he agreed to use a private service company. Cut backs: The BBC will broadcast fewer original TV dramas and more and . more repeats as it continues to be crippled by spending cuts . The unnamed whistleblower, who had been with the corporation for more than 20 years, was told to go freelance. Mrs Hodge said he had been bullied, adding: ‘He was told he would not be employed unless he did that and when he asked for that to be put in writing that was refused to him. ‘He was told by the person whom he was negotiating with – he works full-time with the BBC, has no other employment, has been on his contract for probably getting on for 20 years – “Don’t worry, if you have a service company HMRC is much less likely to investigate you”.’ She added: ‘I have absolutely no reason whatsoever to think that he was telling me anything other than the truth.’ Miss Patel pledged to investigate, adding that the HMRC had been kept informed at every stage. She argued that the BBC would be unable to reduce presenters’ salaries by the desired 25 per cent without the use of service companies. She was unable to guarantee that the 148 ‘off the books’ presenters had paid the proper amount of tax, saying she could not comment on individuals’ tax affairs. But Miss Patel pointed to a tax law aimed at freelancers, known as IR35, which is aimed at ensuring the same tax is paid by people working through personal service companies as well as by full-time employees. In the same Commons session, HMRC . chief Lin Homer admitted that tax inspectors had investigated just 23 . personal service companies. She pledged to increase the number of . investigations ‘ten-fold’ over the next year. The Treasury recently . revealed that some 2,400 senior Whitehall workers  earning more than . £58,000 a year are not being paid under PAYE but through limited . companies. Earlier this . year it was disclosed that the head of the Student Loans Company, Ed . Lester, was being paid via a personal service company. Until February, he received his pay packet without deductions for tax or national insurance. An outcry over the arrangements led to a review of public sector pay. Meanwhile, the BBC’s annual report yesterday revealed that more than half of all BBC2 shows are repeats. The channel’s re-run rate was 55 per cent in the 12 months to April, compared with almost 50 per cent the previous year. In the daytime, it is airing archive shows and more recent repeats, with most original shows moving over to BBC1. BBC1 has a repeat level of 33.1 per cent, up from 32.5 per cent in the previous year, the annual report shows. At peak time, 8.4 per cent of its shows are re-runs compared with 31 per cent for BBC2. The Corporation is airing less TV drama on its flagship channel and replacing it with more repeats from the archives.","The BBC employs the TV and radio presenters .

"An active NAVY Seal and father of three made his college football debut over the weekend. Tom Hruby, a junior at Northwestern University, took the field on Saturday as the Wildcats faced the Michigan Wolverines, even carrying the American flag as the team entered the stadium. And as if the fact that a man with a full time job and three children found time to play on a college football team isn't impressive enough, there is also the fact that Hruby is 32-years-old. Taking the field: Tom Hruby (above carrying American flag) made his college football debut over the weekend at the age of 32 . Family affair: Hruby (above with his sister and two oldest sons) is also a married father of three . Busy schedule: Hruby 9with youngest son Dean) still works full time training Navy SEALs . Hruby's quest to play for the Wolverines began over the summer, when he participated in the team's three-week training camp to try and score a walk on spot. Still a SEAL instructor at Great Lakes Naval Station, he saved up his leave to attend the camp, and in the end it paid off, as the defensive end scored a spot on the roster. Hruby became a SEAL in 2006, and says he has operated in Afghanistan, Iraq, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. It was while in SEAL training that he met his wife Jen, with whom he has three sons all under the age of four; Troy, Ethan and Dean. A little over a year ago, Hruby decided he wanted to have a Northwestern degree, and began studying for the SATs, having previously attended a junior college. Once admitted, he and his wife sold their house and moved in with Hruby's mother in Crown Point, Illinois to save money, and now Hruby stays at the dorms during the week and drives to see his family on the weekends. Practice makes perfect: Hruby saved up his leave so he could attend Northwestern training camp for three weeks over the summer . Proud papa: He lives in the dorms during the week, and drives home to see his three sons (above) and wife on the weekend . 'Our family really likes to challenge each other, and it’s important to us to aspire to our dreams because I don’t think that you can truly be happy unless you go after those dreams that you think are unattainable,' said his wife Jen. It is a lot for one man to handle, and something that is not lost on Northwestern coach Pat Fitzgerald. 'I know I couldn’t do it,' Fitzgerald told the Chicago Sun-Times. 'He’s a man’s man.' He then said of Hruby's drive, 'He was relentless, absolutely relentless, like you would suspect from a SEAL.' Despite all of this however, Hruby remains humble and still driven. 'I don’t feel like where I’m at today is some outstanding or amazing thing,' said Hruby. 'It’s just more of a challenging route . . . the way I kind of think about finding and accepting and trying to take on these challenges that most people would probably say are impossible, one, or very unlikely or just plain dumb.' Unfortunately, the Wildcats lost the game, 10 - 9.","Tom Hruby, an active Navy SEAL and married father of three, made his college football debut over the weekend, playing for Northwestern .

"More than half of Labour's MP candidates in winnable seats for the general election have already worked in politics, new research has found. The party has stuffed its hit list of potential new MPs with former special advisers, party workers and lobbyists - compared to just 17 per cent of Conservative candidates with political backgrounds, and 46 per cent of Liberal Democrats. It will fuel concerns about the development of a 'political class' of people who have never worked in real world jobs, which the public repeatedly say in polls turns them off voting. Will Straw, the son of former Labour minister Jack Straw, ran a blog before he was selected as a candidate . Peter Hain, the former Cabinet . minister who is carrying out a review into how Labour can win back . voters, said the fact that people think politics is 'reproducing itself' is a growing source of discontent. Mr . Hain, Labour MP for Neath who is standing down next year, added: 'It is . not the only factor but it means political parties are getting more . distant from their electorate than they used to be. 'I . think disconnection is so bad now that the old politics is in a . terminal state. I think you can explain a lot of Ukip's rise and the . anti-politics mood around that disconnection.' The . research - compiled by The Guardian - emerged as Ed Miliband, the . Labour leader, and Nick Clegg are currently the least popular they have . ever been, according to a Guardian/ICM poll. 'Just . 22 per cent of people think Mr Miliband is doing a good job while 61 . per cent thinking he is doing a bad job, his lowest rating since 2010. 'In . a study of 177 candidates standing in marginal seats, those which could . change hands with just a 5 per cent swing in votes , or those where the . sitting MP is retiring, over half of the 90 Labour candidates have . already worked in politics. One of the so-called 'Red Princes', Stephen Kinnock, son of former leader Neil, with his wife Helle Thorning-Schmidt . 'Fifteen are ex-MPs standing again having been ousted by the electorate, some of their expenses such as Joan Ryan and Andrew Dismore. Others are current or former staff of Ed Miliband, Yvette Cooper and ex-ministers. 'Tulip Siddiq, 31, who is standing in Hampstead and Kilburn, where Glenda Jackson is standing down, has been a policy adviser to Tessa Jowell and worked on Ed Miliband's leadership campaign. 'Candidates standing for Labour next year also include the so-called 'Red Princes' whose fathers were in politics – Stephen Kinnock, son of former leader Neil, Will Straw, son of former foreign secretary Jack Straw, who works for a think tank. It is widely speculated that Tony Blair's son Euan, 30, could stand in Bootle, Merseyside where 80-year-old MP Joe Benton is standing down. Former Labour minister Peter Hain said the fact that people think politics is 'reproducing itself' is a growing source of discontent . Only 17 per cent of Conservative candidates in their 52 winnable seats have political backgrounds, as many come from business, the law and the military. But they are overwhelming male (68 per cent) while Labour's are 56 per cent women. The Lib Dem candidates are 43 per cent women. Fifteen out of 35 Liberal Democrats selected in the most winnable seats have links to Westminster or Brussels politics. Dr Peter Allen, of Bath University, said over the last 20 or 30 years Labour 'increasingly seem to be picking people who have been political workers.' Dr Allen said: In 'You can't underestimate the symbolic importance of who is in power because people will take their cues about what politics is about and like from what they see. If you see a lot of people who have nothing to do with your day-to-day life, you're going to begin to think politics isn't necessarily something for people like you.' Few candidates from any party come from non-professional jobs, with some exceptions being Lee Sherriff, a former retail worker in Carlisle for Labour, and Scott Mann, a postman standing for the Conservatives in North Cornwall. Sharon Hodgson, the shadow equalities minister said Labour has a Future Candidates programme which helps give people from non-political backgrounds the skills to run for selection. But she added there is 'always more we can do'. 'Lots of people who are drawn to the Labour party are incredibly passionate about the causes that we fight for, and it's therefore no surprise that many of them want to work for the party or in other campaigning roles before running for office. That includes lots of people like myself from ordinary, working-class backgrounds', she said.","Just 17% of Conservative candidates with political backgrounds .

"Murder for hire: Julia Merfeld, 21, pleaded guilty to soliciting a murder after she was caught on hidden camera hiring an undercover detective to kill her husband . A 21-year-old married mother-of-two could spend 20 years in prison after she admitted hiring a hit man to kill her husband because she didn't want to divorce him. Julia Merfeld, 21, from Michigan, was sentenced to spend at least five years and eight months but no more than 20 years in prison today after pleading guilty in June to solicitation of murder. Her husband Jacob Merfeld was in court today and said he has forgiven his wife and she is a good person. She was caught after she was recorded telling an undercover cop who was posing as a hit man that killing him would be easier than divorcing him. Merfeld said she and her husband had been fighting, and that she had been thinking about having him killed for a while because if he was dead, she wouldn’t have to worry about her family’s judgment or ‘breaking his heart'. Two videos made in April were released to The Muskegon Chronicle by prosecutors. The 21-year-old woman pleaded guilty on June 27 to soliciting a murder. Authorities say she wanted her . husband’s $400,000 life insurance policy, and promised to pay the . would-be hit man $50,000 for the killing in several $9,000 installments. During sentencing today Merfeld asked for a lighter sentence. 'I do not believe I'm above punishment. I know what i did was wrong and I take full responsibility,' she said. 'My tears are for remorse not pity.' Scroll down for undercover video .

My tears are for remorse not pity' Plot: Authorities say she wanted her husband¿s $400,000 life insurance policy, and promised to pay the would-be hit man $50,000 for the killing in several $9,000 installments . From left: The parents of Julia Merfeld, Christina and Joe Antonaccio of Keyport, N.J. and Merfeld's husband, Jacob Merfeld who said he forgave his wife . Jacob Merfeld said he did not want his wife to do any prison time and that she was a godly woman who did an ungodly thing. 'I wholeheartedly forgive my wife,' he said. 'She has been nothing but a great mother to our two children.' Police became aware of Mrs Merfeld's plot to have her husband killed when they were tipped off by her co-worker, Carlos Ramos. According . to Ramos, the 21-year-old woman offered him $50,000 for the hit, but he . called police and helped set up a meeting between Merfeld and an . undercover detective posing as a prospective assassin. The . woman and the man she thought to be a gun-for-hire met on April 9 and . 10 in his car. Unbeknownst to Merfeld, both meetings were recorded on a . hidden camera. Sting: Merfeld's co-worker tipped off police about the woman's deadly plot and helped set up a meeting between her and an undercover officer posing as a prospective hit man in April . In cold blood:  The young married mother could be seen smiling broadly and laughing while discussing how and when her husband would be killed . Scheduling: At one point, Merfeld pulled out her smartphone to choose the perfect day on the calendar for her husband's murder . Detail-oriented: Merfeld could be seen ticking off on her fingers the items she has to bring for her next meeting with the hit man the following day . In the videos, the mother-of-two could be seen grinning while discussing the details of the hit on her 27-year-old husband in a detached, matter-of-fact way. 'When I first decided to do this … it’s not that we weren’t getting along,' she says on the video. 'But … terrible as it sounds, it was easier than divorcing him. 'You know, I didn’t have to worry . about the judgment of my family, I didn’t have to worry about breaking . his heart, all that stuff like this. It’s, like, how I got a clean . getaway.' During the two . meetings, the woman calmly tells the hit man that the best time to kill . her husband would be on a Thursday. At one point, she could be seen . checking the calendar on her smartphone covered with a Batman sticker . for the optimal date for the assassination. Getting . down to details, Merfeld explains that she is reluctant to stage the . murder as a burglary gone awry because she is worried that it would . scare off her friend, whom she wanted to move in with her after her . husband's death. During . the second meeting on April 10, Merfeld, sporting a Batman sweatshirt . and a pair of pink sweatpants, stresses several times that she does not . want her spouse to suffer, and that she wants him to die as painlessly . as possible. She even . suggests to the would-be assassin that the best method would be to break . her husband's neck, but the undercover detective tells Merfeld that he . would prefer to use either a gun or a knife. In . response, the 21-year-old chooses the gun and calmly says ‘OK’ when the . detective tells her that he will shoot her spouse in the face. Final preparations: Merfeld turned up for the second meeting with hand-written notes outlining their floor plan and the directions to their home . Blood money: The 21-year-old was asked to pay the assassin $100 as a down payment on the $50,000 contract . Moment of doubt: During her second meeting with the 'killer,' Merfeld appears to have second thoughts about the plot (left), but she quickly goes back on track with the plan to have her husband shot in the head . Merfeld says that she doesn’t want to know exactly when or how the murder would happen and that ‘it would better if you surprised me.’ ‘The more shocked I am when it happens, the better,’ she tells the hit man. ‘I just want to make it as non-suspicious as possible.’ In their first conversation, the young mother tells the hit man that she would prefer the deed to be done outside their West Forest Avenue home, explaining with a laugh that a shooting indoors 'would be messy in the house.' When Merfeld meets up with the detective the following day, carrying a floor plan of their home and directions to the house drawn on lined notebooks sheets, as well as her husband’s' photo, the two decide that the best option is to have Mr Merfeld killed inside the apartment  while she is at work. To make it look like a home invasion gone wrong, the killer will steal items such as a computer. Merfeld also could be seen handing the detective $100 as a down payment to prove to him that she is serious about the hit. At no point during her two encounters with the fake assassin does the 21-year-old wife complain about her husband or cite a specific reason for her decision to have him killed beyond her desire to collect his life insurance. In the course of the second meeting with the cop, Merfeld briefly appears to have second thoughts about the plan. Sentencing: Attorney Joe Fisher reads a statement in court on behalf of his client Julia Merfeld who said she takes full responsibility for her actions . Parents: Christina and Joe Antonaccio of Keyport, N.J. listen to Muskegon County Assistant Prosecutor Timothy Maat prior to the sentencing of their daughter . After the assassin tells her repeatedly that he is going to put two bullets in her husband's 'noggin' and that 'he's gonna die', she smiles nervously and tells him ' it makes me sad.' A few minutes later, she adds, as if thinking out loud, 'it's a bad idea for me.' But not before long, Ms Merfeld appears to be back on track with her deadly plot after the undercover cop stresses that after today, she won't be able to call off the hit even if she has a change of heart at some point before the date chosen for the killing. Merfled then asks the bogus killer: 'What happens if you get caught?' In response, the man reassures her that he will 'take the hit' and keep her name out of the investigation so long as she pays him or his associates ‘on the outside’ the agreed upon sum of $50,000. The second meeting concludes with the hit man and his client shaking hands and him wishing Merfeld luck. 'Thank you. Good luck to you, too,' she replies with a smile as she exits the car. The 21-year-old wife and mother was arrested a short time later and booked into the Muskegon County Jail.","Julia Merfeld, 21, pleaded guilty to soliciting a murder .

"Martin Kimber is to step down as chief executive of Rotherham Borough Council in the wake of a report detailing the sexual exploitation of at least 1,400 children in the town, the authority said. Mr Kimber's position with the council had been under the spotlight in recent weeks with the release of a damning report into widespread and systemic sexual abuse which occurred in the town in the 1990s and 2000s. It is the latest in a series of resignations of public officials who were involved with the council at the time of the abuse. However, the office of Police and Crime Commissioner Shaun Wright has reiterated he has no intention to step down from his role, despite the mounting public pressure. At least 1,400 girls were left to be abused by Asian men because the authorities were too scared to admit there was a race issue, a recent report said. Scroll down for video . Martin Kimber, the chief executive of Rotherham Borough Council, will leave his post in December . Over a 16-year period children as young as 11 were sexually exploited by gangs of men in Rotherham (pictured) Over a 16-year period, children as young as 11 were sexually exploited by gangs of men – most of them of Pakistani origin. But police and council officials suppressed evidence of the crimes because they feared being labelled racist. Mr Kimber, who joined Rotherham Borough Council in 2009, said: 'I believe that new leadership will enable the town to recover more quickly from the events of the last two weeks, and strongly signal a new beginning at this critical time in its recovery.' A council spokesperson said Mr Kimber had only just informed staff of his decision this morning and details of any leaving payoff had not yet been discussed. Professor Alexis Jay's report outlined how hundreds of children had been subjected to trafficking, rape and other sexual exploitation between 1997 and 2013 and how their plight had been ignored by range of agencies, including police, councillors and council officials. Mr Kimber, who has been at the forefront of the council's response to the Jay Report since it was published a fortnight ago, will leave his post at the end of December. He offered an unreserved apology from the authority at a press conference immediately following its release. Mr Kimber has been at the forefront of the council's response to the report since its release a fortnight ago . Today he said: 'The report does not make comfortable reading in its account of the horrific experiences of some young people in the past, and I would like to reiterate my sincere apology to those who were let down when they needed help. 'The events of the past fortnight will again have been an incredibly traumatic time for them and their families, and have shaken the town as a whole. 'The council has now decided what it must do to give the best possible protection for the children and young people of Rotherham. I believe that new leadership will enable the town to recover more quickly from the events of the last two weeks, and strongly signal a new beginning at this critical time in its recovery. The time is therefore now right for me to leave. 'I will be sorry to leave Rotherham but firmly believe that this will leave the council in a stronger position in the future. It is therefore the right thing to do in the interests of the people of the town. Mr Kimber said he was committed to supporting his colleagues at Rotherham Council (pictured) over the next three months . 'I remain committed to supporting colleagues over the next three months. There is no more important job for this council than to ensure it continues to work with partners to seek justice for those young people and their families who are affected by this vile crime, and to give our vulnerable children and young people the protection they deserve.' Mr Kimber was Director of Environmental Services at Wigan before moving into the post in Rotherham in July 2009, taking over from Mike Cuff, who retired after five years in the post. He was previously Assistant Director of Planning and Transportation at Barnsley Council before moving to Wigan. He is the latest of several high profile public officials to step down in the wake of the scandal. Council leader Roger Stone resigned in the immediate aftermath of the report, as did Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner for South Yorkshire, Tracey Cheetham. Since then there have been top-level calls for others in senior positions during the 16 years covered by the report to step down, especially South Yorkshire's Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC), Shaun Wright. South Yorkshire Police commissioner Shaun Wright - who was in charge of Rotherham's children's services from 2005 - 2010, has refused to step down . Before he was elected as PCC, Mr Wright was a councillor in Rotherham for more than a decade and the cabinet member with responsibility for children's services from 2005 to 2010. Prime Minister David Cameron, Home Secretary Theresa May and Labour leader Ed Miliband have all called for Mr Wright to resign. When Labour threatened to drop him last week, Mr Wright resigned from the party. He Mr Wright defiantly repeated his refusal to quit and insisted he will complete his term of office - but announced that he will not seek re-election to the £85,000-a-year post in 2016. His office said today his decision to not step down had not changed in the wake of Mr Kimber's resignation. The 46-year-old previously apologised for his role in the ‘systematic failure’ which allowed the scandal to go undetected for so long, adding: ‘I wish I knew then what I do now.’ He will face questions from MPs tomorrow about his knowledge of the Rotherham child abuse scandal when he appears before the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee. GONE: Tracey Cheetham (left) resigned from her position as deputy police and crime commissioner for South Yorkshire following the report, while Rotherham council leader Colin Stone (right), resigned immediately after its release . Committee chairman Keith Vaz said: 'The revelations from the independent inquiry into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham are deeply troubling. 'The committee will be questioning those in positions of authority at the time that these offences were being committed on how the sexual exploitation of children on a horrifying scale was allowed to go unchallenged for so long.

"It’s a sight that is bound to bring arachnophobes out in a cold sweat – but this spectacular web is not the work of spiders. The 11-foot long web was actually spun by cotoneaster caterpillars. The silk-like material, used to protect larvae from predators, has appeared in the garden of Huddersfield couple, John and Jackie Morris. Astonishing: The huge web has enveloped an entire hedge in the back garden of the home of John and Jackie Morris in Huddersfield . The pair discovered the strange, sticky substance, which looks like something from a sci-fi film, on their rose bush. Mr Morris a long-distance driver, said: ‘The neighbours think it’s really fascinating. ‘I haven’t heard anyone else mention seeing any in the area. Larvae-ly effort: The 11-foot long web was spun by cotoneaster caterpillars . ‘It started a couple of weeks ago and it’s got bigger and bigger. ‘We’re not really bothered about it being there. Once the young hatch it disperses in the weather.’ Gardening expert Graham Porter said: ‘It is unusual in the north of England. ‘The females lay eggs on plants in July and August, with young caterpillars mining into leaves in autumn where they remain until spring when they emerge and spin the webbing and feed in the leaves. They pupate [the non-feeding stage between larva and adult] on the webbing in June and July.’ Cotoneaster caterpillars are the larval stages of the Hawthorn moth, which has a year-long life cycle. The foliage becomes brown and dried up where small, dark brown caterpillars have grazed away the leaf surface. Sizing things up: John and Jackie Morris said the web first appeared two weeks ago and has just kept growing . Hawthorn moth larvae cover their feeding area with a fine white silk webbing. The young caterpillars resume feeding in late spring, when the webbing and damage becomes more extensive and noticeable. When fully fed in early summer, the caterpillars pupate within the silk webbing. Cotoneaster moth caterpillars are 12-15mm long when fully grown and they produce extensive white silk webbing that covers their feeding area.","The 11-foot-long web has appeared in the garden of a Huddersfield .

"They were young men - aged 17, 18 and 20 - when they were sentenced to death in 1975 for a crime they didn't commit. Now three childhood friends who were wrongly imprisoned for nearly 40 years have sat down together for their first proper interview since being exonerated in November, discussing how they are coping living in the 'new world', the lives they missed out on living, and the first thing they did after being freed. Ricky Jackson, now 58 - who holds the U.S. record for  serving the longest time for a wrongful conviction, after 39 years, three months and nine days in prison - and Wiley Bridgeman, 60, walked free last year after the sole witness in their case confessed his testimony had been 'all lies'. Ronnie Bridgeman, 57, Wiley's brother, was released on parole in 2003, after all three sentences were commuted to life  after a Supreme Court ruling in 1978. 'We all have scars that we are never going to be able to recover from,' Jackson told Fusion. Scroll down for video . Finally free: Ricky Jackson (center), Wiley Bridgeman (left) and his brother Ronnie Bridgeman (second left) sit down together for their first television interview since being exonerated in November of a 1975 crime . Emotional: Ricky Jackson, 58, holds the U.S. record for serving the longest time for a wrongful conviction, after 39 years, three months and nine days in prison . Free: The men were officially exonerated by a judge on November 21, 2014 . 'A lot of people want us to feel bitter, resentful and spiteful, (but) i don't. 'That's something that happened. Everyone is going through something in their life. This was our something.' The men were convicted of the May 19, 1975, murder of Cleveland businessman Harry Franks, who was attacked, robbed and shot to death. The trio had walked passed the crime scene and inquired what had happened, and not long after became the prime suspects. They were locked up, and believed everything would be 'straightened out', but were soon facing trial for Franks' murder. The prosecutions case was based on the testimony of a 12-year-old, Eddie Vernon, who said he saw the murder. There was no physical evidence linking the three to Franks. Vernon, now 52, eventually recanted his testimony, saying that police officers coerced him into testifying and gave him details about the case. Changing his account in 2013, he said: 'All the information was fed to me - I don't have any knowledge about what happened at the scene of the crime', Cleveland.com reported. Revisiting the scene: During the interview, the men returned to the street corner where Harry Franks was killed in 1975. They had walked by the scene, and quickly became suspects . A lifetime ago: Ohio businessman Harry Franks was attacked, robbed and shot to death on this Cleveland corner 40 years ago, and these three men were wrongly convicted of his murder . All three men were officially exonerated on November 21, 2014. The ruling released Ricky Jackson and Wiley Bridgeman. And it allowed them to be reunited - finally - with Ronnie Bridgeman, who has changed his name to Kwame Ajamu. According to Fusion, a recent ruling by a judge that acknowledged all three were wrongly convicted makes each of them eligible for up to $40,000 from the state for every year were in prison. That makes Jackson, the longest-serving, eligible for over $1.5 million. But money can't exactly make up for the lives that were stolen from each of them. They each missed important funerals, and the experiencing of being involved with their families. But above all, they missed the chance to have families of their own. 'Whatever we lost is gone ... we can't ever recapture it,' Jackson said. Free men: Wiley Bridgeman, left, and Ricky Jackson, right, were released in November from Cuyahoga County Jail after 39 years behind bars . Back: Bridgeman embraces his brother Ronnie, who was also convicted but let out of prison years before him . Third man: Ronnie Bridgeman, who has since changed his name to Kwame Ajamu, was also put on death row for the murders, but was released in 2003 . Crime scene: This photograph shows the aftermath of the murder for which the Bridgeman brothers and Wiley were convicted . Victim: The three men were wrongly convicted of murdering Harry Franks, a businessman in Cleveland, Ohio . 'I think the opportunity for justice to be served was lost the day we went to court. 'None of us have kids. Just think about that alone. That's what they took away from us. 'I'm not going to forget that.' However the first thing the men did was go to lunch together at Red Lobster. 'I just wanted to go somewhere and talk and eat and drink,' Jackson said. 'That day, I felt like I'd never been locked up.' In the initial court hearings, Vernon said he was on a bus with other schoolchildren when he heard gunshots near the a grocery store called Cut-Rite. Other children on the bus have said Vernon would not have been able to see anything from his seat - and he has since admitted that was true. I'm out! Jackson walks smiling out of the jail after his sentence was quashed. He said he was on 'an emotional high' from being freed . He now claims detectives talked him into testifying, then said if he claimed he was lying his parents could be put in prison for perjury. When he dismissed Jackson's case, Judge Richard McMonagle said, 'Life is filled with small victories, and this is a big one.' 'The English language doesn't even fit what I'm feeling,' Jackson, 57, said as he exited the building Friday. 'I'm on an emotional high.' Thankful: Jackson looks to the sky in court after a judge revoked his sentence last year . Bridgeman, 60, said he never lost hope that he would be freed for good. 'You keep struggling, you keep trying,' he said. Bridgeman embraced his brother Ronnie, who changed his name to Kwame Ajamu, as he walked out of the courthouse. All he could say was that he is unsure what the future holds other than a celebratory fish dinner. Ajamu told him: 'Stick with me. You'll be all right. I ain't never going to let you go.' Jackson and his lawyers planned to celebrate Friday at a hotel. Asked where he was going to live, Jackson replied: 'It's ironic. For 39 years, I've had a place to stay. Now, you know, that's precarious.' Ajamu said in an interview Thursday that the prospect of the three being together again is 'mind-boggling.' He spent his 18th birthday on death row and was in prison when his mother, a brother and a sister died. Party time: Jackson said after almost 40 years' incarceration he went for fish at Red Lobster . He said: 'The idea that my brother - both of those guys are my brothers - are getting out? I don't even care about me.' The Bridgemans' death sentences were commuted to life in prison after the U.S. Supreme Court outlawed capital punishment in 1978. Jackson's sentence was commuted in 1977 because of a technical mistake. Their cases were first re-evaluated after a 2011 article in the Cleveland Scene magazine highlighted Vernon's unreliable testimony. Vernon broke down during a court hearing for Jackson on Tuesday as he described the threats by detectives and the burden of guilt he had carried for so long. Jackson said he holds no animosity toward Vernon. 'It took a lot of courage to do what he did,' he said. 'He's been carrying a burden around for 39 years, like we have. But in the end, he came through, and I'm grateful for that.' Joe Frolik, a spokesman for county prosecutor Tim McGinty, declined to comment on Thursday except to reiterate a statement McGinty made Tuesday: 'The state concedes the obvious.'

"A harrowing 911 call of a dying women gasping for breath after her husband allegedly poisoned her was played out to a jurors today. Husband Dr. Robert Ferrante, 66, allegedly killed his wife by mixing cyanide with an energy drink called creatine, which he told her would help them to conceive another child. Autumn Marie Klein, 41, collapsed at her Oakland, Pennsylvania home and died on April 20 at UPMC Presbyterian, where she also headed the women's neurology department.

The jury listened to a 911 call that Ferrante (left) made where he says she has collapsed in the kitchen and jurors could hear Ferrante begging for help and horrific groaning noises from Klein (right) in the background . The jury heard the frantic - and at times ghastly - 911 call from the first witness, an emergency dispatcher. Ferrante is heard saying his wife has collapsed in the kitchen and jurors could hear him begging for help and horrific groaning noises from Klein in the background. 'She just got home from work.' 'Her whole face is flaccid.' 'Please, please, please, please. She's not saying a word. Please, sweetheart! No!.' 'She's having so much difficulty breathing. Oh, God.' 'Oh, Autumn, please, please sweetheart!. Please.' 'She just got home from work,' Mr. Ferrante told the dispatcher. 'Her whole face is flaccid.' Following the calltaker's instructions, he asked Klein to raise her arms above her head. 'Please, please, please, please. She's not saying a word. Please, sweetheart! No!.' Later, he continues, 'She's having so much difficulty breathing. Oh, God. 'Oh, Autumn, please, please sweetheart!. Please.' The couple have a six-year-old daughter called Cianna. Today assistant district attorney Lisa Pellegrini told the jury that Ferrante attempted to obscure his wife's death, by insisting she shouldn't have an autopsy, reports Pittsburgh Post Gazette. Autumn Marie Klein, 41, collapsed at her Oakland, Pennsylvania home and died on April 20 at UPMC Presbyterian . The couple have a six-year-old daughter together . Despite those instructions, an autopsy was performed, revealing a lethal amount of cyanide in her system. 'All along, the evidence will show you, this defendant thinks he's smarter than everyone else,' Ms. Pellegrini said. He was 'one blood test and one phone call ... away from getting away with the perfect murder.' According to a criminal complaint obtained by ABC News, after Ferrante gave her the drink, Klein wrote, 'Will it stimulate egg production too?' Ferrante allegedly responded with a smiley face. ABC News also reported that hours after a police interview following Klein's death, Ferrante allegedly performed a Google search, writing, 'Would ECMO or dialysis remove traces of toxins poisons?' But defense attorney William Difenderfer told the jurors the ALS expert did not poison his wife. He also said medical experts will show she wasn't poisoned by anyone and died of unexplained causes. 'Myself and Dr. Ferrante do not accept, and will never accept, that Autumn Klein died from orally ingesting hydrogen cyanide.'

"Recorder Philip Cattan is alleged to have fallen asleep during the trial at Manchester Crown Court . A rape trial has collapsed after claims a senior judge fell asleep while an alleged child abuse victim was giving evidence. Respected Manchester barrister, Recorder Philip Cattan, who sits as a judge part-time, was seen to ‘nod off’ as the under-age victim answered questions from the defence. Following concerns he had missed vital evidence during the case - which is already set to cost the taxpayer £10,000 - barristers said they wanted to raise a ‘point of law’. While the jury was out of the room, the judge was confronted with the claim that he had slept through part of the cross-examination of the witness, who was giving evidence via videolink because of her age. The incident was witnessed by the family of the alleged victim in the trial of John Quigley, which was expected to last five days. The decision was then taken to abandon the trial, which began on Monday at Manchester Crown Court and the jury was discharged. The girl giving evidence was the first of two young girls expected to testify that they were abused in offences spanning from 2006 to 2013. She will now have to give evidence a second time when the case is re-listed for next month before a different judge. John Quigley, 49, from Manchester, faces charges of rape of a child under 13, sexual assault of a child under 13, engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child, three counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and four counts of assault by penetration. A spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service said: ‘The jury has been discharged in the trial of R v John Quigley at Manchester Crown Court following an issue that arose in court during the cross examination of the first complainant in the case. ‘The trial will be re-listed as soon as possible. The complainants and other witnesses have been kept informed.’ Leading criminal barrister, Kama Melly, who specialises in child sex crime, told the Daily Mirror: ‘It is devastating for a victim to have a trial delayed so long while an investigation takes place. ‘This is no doubt a traumatic time for the family and this will only serve to make matters worse for them.’ Manchester Crown Court, where the case of John Quigley began on Monday and was due to last five days . She added: ‘There have been cases where a member of the jury has been caught sleeping. In those cases an investigation has to be carried out to find out how much evidence has been missed and if there needs to be a retrial.’ Recorder Cattan, from Cheshire, has so far been unable to comment on the matter. His role as recorder means he sits for up to thirty days a year as a judge and he has previously overseen cases on gangland murders, the Oldham riots and major drugs cases. He now faces an inquiry after a complaint was made to the Judicial Conduct Investigations Office. A spokesman said: ‘The Judicial Conduct Investigations Office is aware of the allegation that Recorder Philip Cattan fell asleep during a trial at Manchester Crown Court. ‘The matter is being considered in accordance with the Judicial Conduct Rules 2013.’ An investigation was launched in 2001 after another judge nodded off during a rape trial. Judge Gabriel Hutton, a former senior judge at Gloucester Crown Court, fell asleep during the trial of Lee Woodward, who was accused of raping a 17-year-old girl on a riverbank in Sharpness, Gloucestershire. He was granted bail and a retrial was demanded where he was cleared. Judge Hutton, now retired, was ordered to apologise for the incident.","Recorder Philip Cattan was seen to 'nod off' during the cross examination .

"Leeds have staved off a winding-up order from former director Melvyn Levi. Leeds-based law firm Ford & Warren last week filed the petition for unpaid fees - reported to be around £150,000 and dating back to when Ken Bates owned the club - on behalf of Levi. Bates, 82, sold Leeds to Bahrain-based investment firm Gulf Finance House Capital in December 2012 and the club changed ownership again in April this year when Italian businessman Massimo Cellino completed his takeover. Leeds owner Massimo Cellino was facing a winding-up petition of £150,000 from law firm Ford & Warren Solicitors . The petition was served in relation to unpaid court fees. A case involving Levi was struck out in 2012 with the judge in the case ordering that Levi's fees be paid by the club.

"These amazing photographs show the stunning beauty inside of the Vatican and churches in Italy. Photographer Richard Silver, 52, spent more than two years capturing unique visions of well-known houses of worship, including the Santa Maria della Pieta in Venice. The church is known by classical music lovers for being associated with Vivaldi and his young female musicians who were orphans. These amazing photographs show the stunning beauty of the inside of the Vatican (left) and churches in Italy, such as the Basilica of St Mary of the Angels in Rome (right) The Santa Maria Maggior in Rome (left) and the Church of Sant'Ignazio di Loyola (right), also in Rome . Some of the other churches Silver, from New York, visited were the magnificent Sant'Ignazio, dedicated to Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Society of Jesus, and the ornate Church Del Gesu in Rome. He has taken photos of churches in Beijing, Istanbul, Easter Island, Milan, Rome, London, Warsaw, Singapore, Shanghai, Goa, Dubai, Trieste and Venice. Silver, who spent two years on the project, said: 'Each photo takes me about an hour and a half to photograph. 'About 45 minutes before sunset, during sunset and about 30 minutes after the sun. I am a very symmetrical person this format worked perfectly. 'What I need is a clear night, no flat grey sky.

Sisto conducted his first Mass in the chapel on August 1483. The Sistine Chapel is most famous for Michelangelo’s frescoes, but long before Michelangelo, Sisto commissioned painters such as Botticelli to fresco the two long walls of the chapel. One side told the story of Moses, the other the story of Christ. Even without Michelangelo’s work, these earlier paintings still represent one of Europe’s greatest fresco cycles. Michelangelo began work on the ceiling in July 1508. The completed frescoes were unveiled in October 1512.

"Ched Evans' fiancée flashed her engagement ring today as the shamed footballer was due to start training with his former club. Natasha Massey, 25, has stood by Evans despite his rape conviction and has agreed to marry him after his release from prison last month. Ms Massey went out shopping in Cheshire today while across in South Yorkshire her partner prepared to return to the club who paid him £20,000 a week until he was jailed. Scroll down for video . Defiant: Natasha Massey, 25, has stood by Evans despite his rape conviction and has agreed to marry him after his release from prison last month. Impending nuptials: Miss Massey was wearing a large ring believed to be her engagement ring . Proposal: Evans is to marry his fiancee Natasha Massey after proposing shortly after he was released from prison, where he served half his five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old girl . Evans was jailed for five years in April 2012 after a jury convicted him of raping a 19-year-old woman at a hotel near Rhyl, North Wales. He was freed after serving half his sentence. Evans lost an appeal against his conviction but his fiancée has launched a campaign, bankrolled by her millionaire father, to clear him and the Criminal Cases Review Commission is fast-tracking the case. He admitted having sex with the teenager, who cannot be named, but insisted she had agreed. However, the court heard that she was too drunk to have consented to sex. The former Sheffield United and Wales striker was released from Wymott prison, Lancashire in October. He then proposed to fiancée Natasha Massey, who has led the campaign to overturn his conviction. But his victim, now 22, has had to change her identity twice after being targeted by trolls who named her online, and is now living away from her friends and family. Her father has demanded an apology from Evans, but he maintains that he is innocent despite the jury's unanimous guilty verdict. His fiancee appeared alongside Evans in a recent video he made, in which he insisted he was guilty only of infidelity - not the rape he was jailed for. In the video, Evans apologised to Ms Massey, who he described as 'the woman I love with all my heart'. Stroll: Miss Massey, who helped launch her partner's appeal, was out walking at lunchtime and popped into a shop for some water . Couple: It is thought Evans, pictured with Ms Massey before he was convicted, did not want to propose from jail . He said: 'I've constantly regretted my act of infidelity and the damage that has been done on so many fronts because of it. 'The support that's been shown by Natasha, our friends and family during the trial and the time spent in prison has kept me strong. 'It can't have been an easy thing to stand by someone who the court found guilty of such a destructive act. I will be forever grateful' It is understood that Evans had not wanted to propose while he was in jail, but planned to asked Ms Massey to marry him as soon as he was freed. Ms Massey has continued to protest Evans's innocence since he was convicted of rape in April 2012. Support: Ms Massey, pictured on ITV's This Morning, said she has put thoughts of Evans's infidelity 'to one side' but believes he is not capable of rape . Evans had been serving at HMP Wymott prison in Lancashire but was released last month . She told ITV's This Morning: 'As soon as I found out that he'd been questioned over rape, my instinct was kind of protective of Ched, and I thought I have to stand by him. 'So my thoughts and feelings over the cheating were put to one side and I just stepped in to help him through this terrible time. 'I know Ched and I knew he wouldn't be capable of committing a crime like that.' The Criminal Cases Review Commission is currently examining Evans's case  as part of his hopes to launch an appeal. He has not been re-signed by his former club or any other team since his release.","Natasha Massey, 25, went shopping in Cheshire without Ched Evans .

"Jordan Spieth has not slept for nearly 30 hours because he is too excited about playing at The Open. His Dallas drawl can’t contain the buzz at being in Hoylake and even after a long flight from the United States his face is fresh and lights up every time he mentions this major championship - especially when he talks about winning it. Spieth doesn’t turn 21 until the end of the month but there is a real chance he could lift the Claret Jug this week. He nearly pulled off one of the greatest wins in history at the Masters, leading by two strokes in the final round before a Bubba Watson masterclass prevented Spieth from breaking Tiger Woods’s record as the youngest ever Augusta champion. VIDEO: Scroll down for Jordan Spieth: The World Cup was amazing for USA . In the zone: Texan Jordan Spieth is thoroughly looking forward to The Open... and feels he can win it . No fear: The 20-year-old has already shown he has all the shots in the book . Spieth announced himself to the world a year ago by becoming the first teenager to win on the PGA Tour since 1931. He’s already cracked into the world’s top 10 and is all but certain to play in the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles. In short, Spieth is a superstar in the making. If he wins at Hoylake this week, his status in America will soar into the stratosphere. ‘I wouldn’t be part of it if I didn’t think I was going to win - there wouldn’t be much point, right?,’ he says with a natural and easy grin when asked about his chances. Despite his origins in Texas, Spieth loves life by the British seaside. ‘It’s better than I could have even imagined. It’s such a cool town. The golf is incredible,’ he gushes. If the present career doesn’t work out, a job with Wirral Tourism is surely his. But given that he has already earned $3.8million on the course this year, he probably doesn’t need to take it. Spieth has had experience of links golf from the Junior Open to his full debut at Muirfield last year. ‘This is what it’s all about, this is really cool,’ he says, grinning again. Spieth thinks he has the key links shots in his armoury too. ‘I grew up playing in the winds of Texas and learnt how to flight my ball and keep it low, so that’s a shot I’m comfortable playing even with a driver.’ But Spieth’s ambitions stretch beyond even winning this Open Championship. He is setting his sights on rewriting the history books. ‘I would love to break Jack’s record of major championships and if I capture one soon then I think I’m on the best path of anybody,’ he says. Hang on a second – is Jack Nicklaus’s record of 18 major titles really a target for him? Confidence: Spieth believes he will win this weekend... and also has Jack Nicklaus' 18-majors record in his sights . Future in the game: Spieth takes part in practice on a glorious day at Hoylake on Wednesday . ‘Yeah,’ he responds. ‘I believe that each and every time I enter a tournament I have the chance to win. I’m fighting as hard as I can to win. Maybe I can win 20 (majors), who knows. That’s quite a stretch, everybody’s going to laugh. But hopefully I’ll enter another couple of hundred. But, shoot.’ That little Texan exclamation is another reason why it’s impossible not to like Spieth. His bold claims contain no arrogance or bluster - he even insists there is nothing special about his golf. ‘There’s nothing in my game that stands out as ridiculously good. I don’t hit the ball extremely far. I don’t overpower golf courses. My iron play isn’t the best there is.’ He is just a charming, engaging American kid. But he also happens to possess a competitive fire that could burn through wrought iron. Spieth admits he was so emotional during his Masters debut that his hands ‘were shaking from the moment I arrived until the end of the week.’ Yet under the most pressure he has ever felt, Spieth  basked in the fierce duel on golf’s grandest stage. Learning curve: Spieth basked under the pressure at the Masters, but was ultimately beaten by Bubba Watson . ‘I controlled my emotions better than I could have imagined,’ he says. ‘That gave me the opportunity to settle in and play my game, use the adrenaline, feed off the crowd.’ But how is it possible for a 20-year-old to stay so cool? ‘I don’t think of my age,’ he insists. ’I don’t think it as disadvantage or an advantage. I was just battling against Bubba. We could be doing that on his golf course on Saturday afternoon but this happened to be the Masters.’ Spieth was ‘stung’ by the defeat but he has had a taste of the big time and wants more, starting this week. ‘Winning multiple majors in a couple of years may be difficult, but I also didn’t think I’d be here a couple of years ago. You never know what may happen. The only things I can control is doing right things off the course and working my butt off. ‘It’s all about grabbing those trophies and eventually leaving a legacy I’m proud of.’ Watch out, Jack.

"The U.S. government is relinquishing its control of the Internet's address system in a shift that may raise questions about the future direction of online innovation and communications. The decision announced Friday begins a long-planned transition affecting the stewardship of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN. That's a not-for-profit agency launched in 1998 by the Commerce Department to govern the system that assigns website addresses and directs Internet traffic. The department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration, or NTIA, hopes to end its oversight of ICANN's Internet Assigned Numbers Authority by the time its contract expires in September 2015. Hand over: The U.S. government will no longer run ICANN after September 2015 . The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority administers the technology that keeps computers connected to the Web and steers Internet traffic. Proposals for a new ICANN stewardship will be accepted beginning next week at a conference in Singapore. Although it's too early to tell how future oversight will be handled, the U.S. government appears determined to hand over the reins to an entity without political entanglements. 'We will not accept a proposal that replaces the NTAI's role with a government-led or intergovernmental solution,' Lawrence Strickling, assistant secretary at the Commerce Department, told reporters. That statement may ease concerns that oversight of ICANN will be turned over to International Telecommunications Union, which is part of the United Nations. Although other countries have had a say in how the Internet works, the U.S. government retained veto power over ICANN. That role has fueled recurring debates about whether the U.S. government exerts too much influence over technology that plays such a pivotal role in society and the economy. The concerns about the United States' role in ICANN have intensified during the past nine months amid a series of media leaks from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. The disclosures have revealed that government spy programs have been vacuuming up emails and other personal data off of Internet services for at least the past six years as part of the country's anti-terrorism efforts. Strickling said the 'timing is right' for the Commerce Department to start to phase out of ICANN. Non-government: Lawrence Strickland, assistant secretary at the Commerce Department, says proposals from government organizations will not be accepted . Some Internet groups contend the U.S. government should remain in a supervisory position to prevent leaders in other countries with a history of suppressing free speech from trying to manipulate ICANN in a way that censors online communications. 'Without the U.S. government providing an effective backstop to ICANN's original operating principles, there would be no mechanism in place to stop foreign governments from interfering with ICANN's operations,' Daniel Castro, senior analyst for the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, wrote in a Friday blog post. The U.S. government appears to be trying to dictate the agenda for the upcoming changing of the guard at ICANN, said Greg Shatan, a New York attorney specializing in Internet issues for the law firm of Reed Smith. In the process, the U.S. could make it more difficult for other countries seizing upon the Snowden revelations to gain greater control over the agency. U.S. leaders 'didn't like the way the wind is blowing, so they are trying to move the fan to blow the wind in a different direction,' Shatan said. Fadi Chehade, ICANN's president, took a diplomatic stance to the looming shift in power. 'All stakeholders deserve a voice in the management and governance of this global resource as equal partners,' he said.","The National Telecommunications and Information Administration will end its oversight of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)

"From the Simpsons and the Flintstones, to Snow White and Wonder Woman, one artist has put a disturbing spin on the animated lives of America's favorite cartoon characters. No Violence Against Women is a project intended to throw the issue of domestic abuse into the spotlight, by forcing us to confront what goes on behind the happy veneer of many real-life families and relationships. Italian artist and activist AleXsandro Palombo, 40, who is based in Milan, tells MailOnline: 'I wanted to give visibility to a problem that affects a great amount of women all over the world.' Unsettling: Italian artist and activist AleXsandro Palombo has re-imagined iconic cartoon characters in domestic violence situations, to raise awareness for violence against women . The artist, who is famous for his thought-provoking satirical work, chose 'the most iconic cartoon characters of all time' to illustrate his point, and released the images in honor of International Women's Day earlier this year. His cast includes a bloodied Snow White at the feet of Prince Charming and a battered Marge Simpson standing dejectedly next to her husband Homer, who, like fellow fictional patriarchs Fred Flintstone and Peter Griffin, grins vacantly beside his wife as if nothing is amiss. The only male figure who looks conventionally menacing is Popeye, who wears his trademark scowl, and perhaps the smiling Fred Flintstone, who, on closer inspection, is gripping his baton shiftily behind his back. Family Guy: Mr Palombo says he chose America's most famous cartoons to 'give visibility to a problem that affects a great amount of women all over the world' Hidden horrors: This image shows a grinning Fred Flintstone, who, upon closer inspection, is gripping his baton shiftily behind his back, as wife Wilma stands injured by his side . One banner bears the stark question: 'What Kind of Man are You?' Such challenging art generally sparks a divided response, but regardless of how the message is conveyed or received, violence against women remains a profound issue all over the world. 'Domestic violence is a problem so widespread that its victims and perpetrators could be anyone,' Mr Palombo says. 'Even in couples that appear to be normal.' Popeye and Olive Oil: The images are undoubtedly disturbing, and, like other famous re-worked cartoon art before it, is likely to trigger polarized reactions . Rampant problem: 'Domestic violence is a problem so widespread that its victims and perpetrators could be anyone,' Mr Palombo says . According to DomesticViolence.org, one woman in the U.S. is beaten or assaulted every nine seconds. Furthermore, domestic violence is classed as the leading cause of injury to women in the U.S - more than car accidents, muggings, and sexual assaults combined. And sadly, based on government reports, between 55per cent and 95per cent of women who have been physically abused by their partners never contact non-governmental organizations, shelters, or the police for help. Snow White and her not-so Prince  Charming: Domestic violence causes more injury to women in the U.S. than car accidents, muggings, and rapes combined . Dismal statistics: Between 55per cent and 95per cent of female domestic abuse victims never contact non-governmental organizations, shelters, or the police for help . What kind of man are you? Mr Palombo has used Disney princesses and other famous cartoon character in much of his political or social artistic statements in the past . For Mr Palombo, its not the first time Disney characters have appeared in his provocative work. Earlier this year, he published a project entitled Do You Still Like Us? - which saw Pocahontas, Cinderella and Snow White, amongst others, in wheelchairs or with crutches and missing limbs. The artist, who lost his own leg to cancer two years ago, gained wide applause for raising awareness around the subject of people with disabilities. Earlier works dive into the morally-fraught fashion world, including an image depicting Vogue editor Anna Wintour clutching a butcher's knife and a rabbit's head - a reference to her outspoken obsession with fur - and another which sees designer Victoria Beckham as a bikini-clad skeleton, entitled Anorexic Fashion Icon.

"Norwegian prodigy Martin Odegaard admits Liverpool are his dream club but that will not influence any decision on his future. The teenager was known to be one of the brightest properties in Europe even before he made his debut for the national senior side last month aged just 15, becoming the youngest player to feature in a European Championship qualifier. He has already trained with the youth teams of Bundesliga sides Bayern Munich and Stuttgart - and also met Borussia Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp - has visited Real Madrid and is set to see Liverpool's facilities for himself next month. VIDEO Scroll down to watch highlights of the 15-year-old wonderkid from Norway . Martin Odegaard in action for Norway in the Euro 2016 qualifier against Bulgaria in Oslo last month . And while the Stromsgodset midfielder has followed his father in becoming a Reds fan, he is confident that will not affect his thinking when he makes his next career choice, most likely in the summer. 'Liverpool have always been my dream club,' Odegaard told German newspaper Sport Bild. 'But I will not let this affect my decision when I choose a new club. 'It's all about finding the team that is best for me and for my development. That is not necessarily Liverpool. Odegaard (left), pictured in action for Stromsgodset, is likely to be one of the game's best young players . The 15-year-old wonderkid is a life-long fan of Liverpool but says that won't influence any decision he makes . 'I haven't really thought about my future yet. I will end the season here and then visit a number of clubs. I have not made a final decision yet, though. 'Of course, it's flattering when you hear that big clubs are after you, but I don't think about it too often.' Last week Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers, speaking after their 1-0 defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions League, was reluctant to talk about Odegaard but did praise his qualities. 'I know he's a big talent, at that age to be playing senior football at 15 and in a competitive league,' said the Northern Irishman. 'He's got wonderful ability and wonderful talent, but there's nothing much more to say on him.'

"CLICK HERE to read Sportsmail's full interview with Steven Gerrard as the Liverpool captain talks Balotelli, Sturridge... and the future (you will be surprised by what he says!) Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has never been one to shirk a difficult question or keep quiet when his team haven't played well. As his Liverpool side look to find their way out of what has been a difficult start to the 2014-15 Premier League season, the 34-year-old has been speaking openly about his future, Mario Balotelli, Daniel Sturridge and why Luis Suarez should be a front runner for the Ballon d'Or. Here, Sportsmail gathers the best 10 quotes from our Gerrard interview. Steven Gerrard (right) tells Sportsmail his thoughts on Mario Balotelli, Daniel Sturridge and Luis Suarez . GERRARD ON HIS FUTURE . 'I certainly won’t be retiring this summer. I will play beyond this season. We will have to wait and see if that’s at Liverpool or somewhere else. That’s Liverpool’s decision. If they don’t come then I will see what’s out there.’ GERRARD ON RONALDO . ‘Coaches have always said to me there are times no tactics, or anything you can do, will stop quality football. ‘That first Madrid goal (against Liverpool at Anfield), very few in the world can finish that. I applaud that goal, a magical goal by a magical player. Liverpool skipper Gerrard believes Real Madrid striker Cristiano Ronaldo is a 'magical player' ‘The first I saw Ronaldo was in a friendly against Manchester United, for Sporting Lisbon. He tore the back out of John O’Shea. I felt sorry for him. It’s been interesting to see him progress, improving year by year. I think he has changed from being an individual player out wide — a showman who sometimes did skill that didn’t always hurt you — to being more direct and lethal. ‘In the old days he could be stopped. I saw Ashley Cole mark him out of the game. John Arne Riise used to do well against him. ‘Now he does all his work around the box, between the lines where you can’t pick him. I’ve never seen a player improve year by year so quickly.’ ON SUAREZ . ‘He scored 31 goals and was voted best player in the hardest league in the world. Why’s he not on the Ballon d’Or list? Incredible.’ Luis Suarez deserves to be challenging Ronaldo for this year's Ballon d'Or, claims Gerrard . Suarez scored 31 goals for Liverpool last season before leaving for Barcelona . ON STURRIDGE . ‘Ability-wise he is possibly the No 1 (English) striker I’ve played with, when you talk about speed, sharpness and skill and different types of goals. Some of the things he does in training blow me away.' ON BALOTELLI . ‘I like the guy . . . he likes being the main man up front. If he wants that at Liverpool you have to score goals. Yes, it seems he likes the attention, he likes being the main man up front. 'He loves the social media and loves talking to supporters and if he wants that at Liverpool you have to score goals. He will know that. And if he didn’t know it coming in then he will know it now.’ Gerrard has hailed Daniel Sturridge as 'possibly the No 1 English striker' he has played with . The Liverpool skipper likes Mario Balotelli and believes the striker knows he will have to score more goals . ON FITNESS . 'When I’m training off the pitch I normally do three weight sessions each day to improve my upper-body strength and one working on my lower body to improve leg strength. I also do two core or Pilates sessions to increase my flexibility.' ON PRESSURE . ‘We are being judged all the time and you have to accept it and embrace it and enjoy the pressure. That’s what I have learned to do ever since I was 19. I had to. There is no hiding place. People will point fingers.’ ON THE TOP FOUR . ‘To get into the top four we have to stop conceding stupid goals. But that is something Brendan is addressing and I can assure all the Liverpool fans out there we will improve and we will get better.’ The 34-year-old midfielder has learned to enjoy the pressure of playing at Anfield . Gerrard insists the 'slipped' chant from opposition fans drives him on to perform better . Gerrard (left) slips to let in Demba Ba to score against Chelsea . ON 'SLIPPED' CHANT . ‘Does it affect me? No, it drives me on to perform better. It has taken time to recover from last season, of course. For players and supporters. It was a huge setback when we fell short. It hit me hard.' ON HIS ROLE AS CAPTAIN . ‘I think when you are captain and you’re asked a question in front of the cameras you have to be honest, or what is the point in speaking? Players who say the wrong thing, or lie, or twist what is really happening out there . . . what is the point? I’d rather not go and speak. Basle was an honest appraisal.' The former England captain (centre) believes honesty is a key part of being a strong eader .

"A mother was prompted to totally transform her lifestyle after an embarrassing incident in hospital. Sarah Bagley, 34, was left humiliated after a hospital bed collapsed under her 17st 6lb weight. The obese mother-of-four decided to change her lifestyle and has since lost and incredible 8st through diet and exercise. Sarah Bagley went from 17st 6lb (left) to 9st  (right) after completely changing her diet and exercise regime . Mrs Bagley, of Frizington, Cumbria, was in hospital for complications after giving birth when the hospital equipment collapsed under her. She said: 'As doctors prepared to wheel me to a ward in a stretcher bed, the whole thing collapsed under my weight. 'I couldn't believe I was so big that I broke a bed. I felt humiliated and I knew at that moment that I had to change.' Mrs Bagley struggled with her weight for years after piling on the pounds during her four pregnancies. By the time she reached size 22, Mrs Bagley, a former kitchen assistant, was too ashamed to take her children swimming. She said: 'I refused to take my kids to the swimming pool, no matter how much they begged. Sarah piled on weight over her four pregnancies, indulging in near daily takeaways (left) but has now adopted a clean-eating lifestyle, avoiding processed foods and eating a diet high in protein (right) 'I hated it, but I was in denial. I wouldn't even weigh myself because I was too afraid. I could never find clothes that fit, especially from fashionable shops. I stuck to wearing black all the time and hiding away. 'Being overweight made me feel dreadful. But I told myself it was normal to put on weight when you have children.' Mrs Bagley, who is married to postman Gavin Bagley, 36, and is a devoted mother to her four sons Ethan, 11, Hayden, 8, Finley, 6 and Ollie, 4, would feed her children nutritious meals before squashing into the sofa in front of the TV and tucking into a takeaway. Sarah, left before she lost weight, used to eat a chicken and coleslaw baguette with crisps, a chocolate bar and a can of coke just for lunch, snacking continuously on crisps, buttered toast and muffins . Sarah, left after giving birth to son Ethan, now 11, was spurred into losing weight by humiliating experience after the birth of her fourth son when a hospital bed collapsed beneath her (right, having lost weight) She said: 'My biggest vice was eating takeaway every night - I had fish and chips, Chinese, Indian, anything going. It must have cost me a fortune. 'It was a really bad example to set to my kids. They didn't eat what I did, but they noticed what I was doing.' After giving birth to her fourth son Ollie in 2010, Mrs Bagley was rushed to hospital after she developed a condition called pelvic arthropathy, which causes instability in the pelvic joints. It was while being wheeled from her room to the operating theatre that the bed on which she lay collapsed beneath her weigh t. Mrs Bagley said: 'It was horrendous - I was really embarrassed. The doctors were really nice about it and they told me it had happened before, but I knew they were trying to be nice. 'I was on so many painkillers so it only hurt my pride. Sarah showing off her weight loss in a pair of her old trousers . 'To make matters worse when I was back in my room a nurse chortled as she asked how my skinny husband, Gavin, had ended up with a big girl like me. 'It should have been one of the happiest days of my life, but all I could think about was my bulging body.' Mrs Bagley finally faced the scales and confronted her weight gain. She said: 'I knew I was big but I was blissfully unaware of how much I had let myself go. 'Doctors had to weigh me to work out my medication. Tears of horror streamed down my face as I stepped on the scales - I weighed 17 stone and six pound. No wonder the hospital bed had collapsed.' Mrs Bagley decided to change her life once and for all by swapping takeaways for lean meat and fresh vegetables. She also started taking long walks. After two years Mrs Bagley lost 3st. In an effort to shift the extra pounds the motivated mother then joined a gym and signed up to her local slimming club. Now four years later Mrs Bagley is down to a size eight, weighing in at 9st. She said: 'I can run around or swim with the kids, and wear tight, glamourous outfits - people don't even recognise me.' Before her life-changing weight loss Mrs Bagley ate nothing for breakfast, then gorged on a chicken and coleslaw baguette with crisps, a chocolate bar and a can of coke for lunch, followed by a chinese takeaway with a chocolate bar and a can of cola for dinner. Throughout the day she would snack on crisps, buttered toast and muffins. Now health-conscious Mrs Bagley has wholemeal toast with peanut butter and banana for breakfast, boiled eggs with fruit and a fat-free greek yoghurt for lunch and chicken with sweet potato, spinach and salad for dinner. Throughout the day Mrs Bagley snacks on fresh fruit and enjoys a daily protein shake. As well as changing her diet, Sarah says she has changed her mindset and now sees food as fuel rather than a comfort or a distraction (left, before losing weight, right, pictured now in a pair of her old trousers) Mrs Bagley said: 'I've been clean-eating. I don't eat anything processed and I try and get a lot of protein in. 'I used to eat so much throughout the day, I ate because it was mindless. Now I eat to fuel my body. 'The kids keep asking me why I don't eat chocolate anymore.' The mother, who stays at home to care for her youngest son who has autism, has started exercising, attending fitness classes such as boxercise and body pump. She said: 'I have a new love of exercise - I used to get out of breath walking around the block and now I run 40 miles a week. 'For me the weight loss has been a very happy side effect of getting physically fit and healthy. 'I used to get picked last in P.E. and now I'm quite the athlete.' Mrs Bagley plans on becoming a personal trainer to try and encourage others to lose weight. She said: 'I want to help people who are in the situation I was in. No matter how tough your situation, it is not hopeless.'","Sarah piled on weight during her four pregnancies .

"FC Rostov head coach Igor Gamula has been suspended for five matches after being found guilty of making racist comments, the Russian Football Union (RFS) said in a statement on Wednesday. Ukrainian-born Gamula said he wouldn't sign any more black players and joked that Ebola had spread to his club at a press conference last month, but after his comments were published the coach insisted he was joking and the English media didn't understand his 'Russian humour'. Asked after the match against Ural Ekaterinburg on October 31 if Rostov had signed Cameroon defender, Benoit Angbwa, who attended the game, Gamula said: 'We already have six black players, do you want me to get a seventh? Angbwa just lives here, we will not be buying him.' VIDEO Scroll down to watch Watch FIFA's powerful anti-discrimination campaign video . Rostov coach Igor Gamula was suspended for five matches for a 'joke' about black players and Ebola . Rostov had been linked with Cameroon defender Benoit Angbwa, seen here playing for Anzhi against Spurs . The 54-year-old Gamula's comments caused a storm in the media, especially in Britain. 'I immediately told the journalist that my remarks were between him and me and it was a joke. He took the quote and published it,' Gamula said. 'I will say it again - it was a joke. I have a great relationship with all the team's dark skinned players. The British press just doesn't understand our Russian humour.' Rostov's South Africa central defender Siyanda Xulu didn't see the funny side of the 'joke' either, and said he would not train until Gamula apologised to all of the club's dark-skinned players. Rostov's South Africa central defender Siyanda Xulu (right) and other black players at the club demanded and received an apology from their coach . Gamula personally said sorry to each of the players in question and they all shook hands with him. South Africa's Minister for Sport, Fikile Mbalula, and South African FA president Danny Jordaan have asked FIFA to look further into Gamula's comments. 'Any country that is going to host the World Cup should be hospitable to any race or nation, without discrimination because of the colour of a person's skin and in particular Russia,' Jordaan said referring to the 2018 finals. 'Therefore I believe that he (Gamula) deserves the harshest possible punishment. This is not the first time that such things have been said in Russia.' Angbwa (right), previously of Krylia Sovetov,  had been linked with a move to struggling Rostov . Dynamo Moscow's Congo defender Christopher Samba and Zenit St Petersburg's Brazil striker Hulk were both victims of racist abuse by opposition fans during matches in September. 'Of course, you need to watch what you say, especially when we are trying to battle against racism,' RFS vice president Nikita Simonyan said after Wednesday's disciplinary committee meeting. 'If you want my personal opinion, I think Gamula said he was sorry enough times. He literally slapped himself in his face for making such an unfortunate joke.' Gamula said the RFS had told him not to comment on his ban.","Igor Gamula, coach of Russian club Rostov, suspended for five games .

"Paul Fleiss, the pediatrician father of former Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss, has died aged 80. The beloved doctor, who pleaded guilty in 1995 to conspiring to hide profits from his daughter's prostitution ring, passed away in his Los Angeles home on Saturday with his son Jesse by his side. Radar Online reported he died from complications after being hit by a car about six months ago. 'He cycled every Sunday with a friend, until he was hit by a car,' a family insider said. Tragic: Beloved pediatrician Paul Fleiss died in his Los Angeles home on Saturday aged 80 (undated picture) Supportive dad: Paul Fleiss pictured with his infamous daughter, former Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss, at the signing of her 2003 memoir 'Pandering' in California (date of picture unknown) Jesse . Fleiss heard his dad struggling to breathe and called 911 on Saturday morning, but he was . pronounced dead at the scene when paramedics arrived. Although . Dr Fleiss rose to fame in the 1990s when his daughter's exclusive . call-girl ring was exposed, he was known to many as a dedicated . children's doctor. Dr Fleiss, an avid cycler, was known for his . gentle bedside manner and continuing to make house calls into his old age. He also ran his own medical practice. While . he . was a pediatrician to the children of several Hollywood celebrities, he . also looked after patients whose families could not afford to pay him. A . vocal opponent of circumcision, he penned the landmark 2002 book, 'What . Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Circumcision', outlining . misconceptions and myths around the common surgery. Family man: Dr. Paul Fleiss, pictured with his grandson, was a beloved and well-known pediatrician . Tributes have poured in on social media for the renowned doctor, with many of his patients describing him as a 'champion of infant health, breastfeeding, and conscious parenting'. 'My children were beyond lucky to have this delightful, gentle man as their pediatrician, Los Angeles mom Erin Riley wrote on Facebook. 'He blazed a path away from old accepted child rearing beliefs, such as corporal punishment, and and a doctor-knows-best attitude to focus parenting and health care on the child as an individual and as a whole person.' Mom Stephanie Glazer Wieland wrote: 'He gave me the confidence to nurse my daughter, even through emergency gallbladder surgery when she was only 3 weeks old, and when the hospital doctors were telling me I was crazy and should just switch to formula.' Dr Fleiss was born on September 8, 1933, in . Detroit. He trained as a pharmacist and osteopath and moved to Los Angeles . wher he completed a residency in . pediatrics at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center. His marriage to Elissa Ash, Heidi Fleiss' mother, ended in divorce. Court battle: Paul Fleiss addresses the media outside the Federal Courts Building in Los Angeles on Tuesday, October 1, 1996. He pleaded guilty in 1995 to conspiring to hide profits made by his daughter Heidi Fleiss . 'Hollywood madam to the stars': Heidi Fleiss, who was convicted on pandering charges in late 1994, appears in court on 30 January 1995 for a hearing to request a retrial . The father-of-six was infamously convicted in 1995 for signing the mortgage to a luxury home used as a base for his daughter's illegal escort business. Surrounded by hundreds of his supporters in court, Dr Fleiss was sentenced to three years’ probation, 625 hours of community service and a $50,000 fine. However he escaped a lengthy prison term and his medical license was not suspended. 'I never intended to cheat or lie or steal,' Dr Fleiss said outside the courtroom. 'I only wanted to help my daughter.' His daughter apologized for her dad's troubles, saying outside court: 'I'm so sorry. He didn't deserve any of this.' Heidi Fleiss, who began a prostitution ring in 1990, had call-girls who serviced some of the biggest stars in Hollywood, such as Charlie Sheen and Timothy Hutton. Fleiss was arrested in 1994 following a police sting in which one of her girls was arrested and cooperated with the police. She was convicted on a slew of charges, including pandering, which were overturned in 1996. She was later charged and convicted of tax evasion, was imprisoned for 20 months and was released to a halfway house in 1998 where she lived for about a year.

"Accused: Michelle Smith White, 37,  tattooed the name of a 16-year-old student on her body . A North Carolina high school teacher has been charged with having sex with a 16-year-old female student after she was caught with a tattoo of teenager's name. Michelle Smith White, 37, had the student’s name and initials tattooed on her body after ‘engaging in a sex offense’ with the 16-year-old, court documents claim. White met the alleged victim while working as a dance teacher at a local high school in Durham, North Carolina, in 2012, when the girl was just 15 years old,  and the friendship later evolved into a sexual one. White worked at Charles E. Jordan High School, where the alleged victim was a student, from 1997 until April 2014. Upon leaving the school, White was asked by the teen’s parents to stop communicating with their daughter, but the pair were caught exchanging sexually charged text messages in May, WRAL-TV reports. The texts included the word ‘threesome’ and ‘alluded to the involvement of Ms White's husband,’ according to an affidavit by the Durham County Sheriff's Office. The affidavit backs an application for a warrant to search White's home, computers and phones. White has also been ordered to show a tattoo which depicts an ‘artist rendering which would be symbolic of the juvenile’ as well as the teen’s name and initials, to be used as evidence. Police have also asked to seize several framed photos of White with the alleged victim, a handwritten card, and a binder filled with notes from White's husband to the teenager. White has been charged with taking indecent liberties with a student and engaging in a sex offense with a student. White worked as a dance teacher at Charles E.

"Casey Williams, five, in the wheelchair her mother has to push her to school in everyday . A mother may have to withdraw her disabled daughter from school because the local council axed her free taxi transport when she received a wheelchair. Casey Williams, five, from Preston, Lancashire, was diagnosed with cerebral palsy last year and was provided with free transport to take her to and from school. But her mother Sarah Williams claims that since Casey now has a wheelchair, Lancashire County Council have said she no longer qualifies for free transport to Blessed Sacrament Catholic Primary School. The 32-year-old used to carry Casey to school or push her in a buggy until she got too heavy - but when she fell pregnant again she could no longer lift the youngster. And since giving birth to seven-week-old baby Kaylen, the mother-of-four finds it impossible to manage her daughter's wheelchair and a pushchair on the 0.7 mile journey. Ms William's mother has volunteered to look after her baby grandson every morning while her daughter tackles the school run with Casey and her two older children. But the single mother, who is appealing the ruling, said that if she loses she will have no choice but to keep the youngster off school. She said: 'After school I have to rely on my eight-year-old pushing the baby in the pram so I can push the wheelchair. 'And that isn't fair on her - it means she can't go to any after school clubs or anything like that because I need her help. 'I can't keep relying on my mum.' By law, councils are required to provide transport for primary school children who live more than two miles from their nearest available school. Ms Williams said the county council allocated Casey a free taxi for the journey until the end of the school term in July while the family were waiting for a wheelchair. But when she contacted the authorities before the start of the new academic year she was told Casey didn't meet criteria. Casey, pictured left and right at home,  was initially provided with free transport to and from school, but this was stopped when she received a wheelchair . She said: 'If I didn't have a newborn I wouldn't be asking for help at all - but I can't push them both to school. Casey is too big now.' Phil Huddart, Lancashire County Council's school transport manager, said: 'We don't discuss individual cases in detail because of confidentiality. These cases are often more complicated than they appear and we are still awaiting the outcome of a further appeal. 'We can offer help with school transport under certain circumstances although assessments must always focus on the needs of the individual child, not the situation of other family members. 'To qualify for transport help, children are also expected to attend the nearest suitable school to where they live. This map shows the nearly one mile route the two must make twice a day to get Casey to school and back . Casey must now be pushed to and from Blessed Sacrament Catholic Primary School (pictured) everyday . The five-year-old was diagnosed with cerebral palsy last year but her mother is struggling to get her to school . 'When an appeal is made it is a chance for both sides to look at the situation afresh and consider any alternatives which may be appropriate.' Mr William's father Keith Williams, 56, said: 'I think it is absolutely disgusting really that we have to go through all of this to get a taxi for a child with a disability. 'We are appealing the decision at the moment but we have to wait until the beginning of October to find out whether she will be granted the free transport or not. 'But in the mean time it is a real struggle for Sarah as she has three other children and she can't push the wheelchair and the baby's pram. 'No one from the council has been out to assess Casey - they have just said she doesn't fit their criteria, but every child with cerebral palsy is different. 'It is a bad day when you have to go through all of this. The whole situation makes me really angry.'","Sarah Williams' daughter Casey was diagnosed with cerebral palsy last year .

"President Barack Obama reaffirmed on Wednesday the United States' position that Tibet is 'part of the People’s Republic of China.' 'We are not in favor of independence,' Obama said during a joint press conference in Beijing with Chinese President Xi Jinping. 'But we did encourage Chinese authorities to take steps to preserve the unique cultural, religious and linguistic identity of the Tibetan people,' the U.S. leader said. Scroll down for video . No change: President Barack Obama said today during a press conference with Chinese President Xi Jinping  in Beijing that the U.S. still does not support independence for Tibet . Obama, left, is pictured here shaking hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping, right, after a joint press conference at the Great Hall of People. Obama paid a state visit to China after attending the 22nd Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders' Meeting . Obama has been unwavering in his stance that Tibet should remain under the control of China, sharing the same viewpoint with exiled Tibetan leader His Holiness the XIV Dalai Lama when he visited the White House earlier this year. After the February meeting the White House said in a statement similar to the one offered by Obama today that the president expressed 'strong support' for traditions and 'the protection of human rights for Tibetans.' 'The President stressed that he encourages direct dialogue to resolve long-standing differences and that a dialogue that produces results would be positive for China and Tibetans,' the White House said, and explained that the U.S. does not back independence for the region. In response, the White House said the Dalai Lama 'stated that he is not seeking independence for Tibet and hopes that dialogue between his representatives and the Chinese government will resume.' Careful not to anger the Chinese, who said at the time that the meeting was 'a gross interference in China's internal affairs' and 'a serious violation of the norms of international relation,' the White House kept the president's hour-long one on one with spiritual leader of Tibet mostly quiet, keeping both his entrance and exit from the president's home out of sight from photographers. In today's overseas press conference Obama advocated on behalf of Tibet without formally taking its side in its dispute with China, citing 'America’s unwavering support for fundamental human rights of all people.' Obama said he and President Xi 'had a very healthy exchange around these issues,' and he told the Chinese head that 'it is so important for us to speak out for the freedoms that we believe are universal, rights that we believe are the birthright of all men and women, wherever they live, whether it is in New York or Paris or Hong Kong.' Continuing, Obama said, 'We think history shows that nations that uphold these rights - including for ethnic and religious minorities - are ultimately more prosperous, more successful, and more able to achieve the dreams of their people.' President  Obama is pictured here meeting with His Holiness the Dalai Lama in the Map Room of the White House on Feb. 18, 2010.  The president traditionally meets with important world leaders in the Oval Office, but when the exiled Tibetan leader comes, he alway speaks with him in the less prestigious setting . The Dalai Lama, left, wasn't event allowed to exit the White House through the front door when he visited Obama in 2010. He was forced to walk out the doors of the Palm Room, passing by trash bags waiting to be picked up due to delays from a snow storm . In a statement following Obama's remarks President Xi said he had a 'candid discussion' with his U.S. counterpart on the topic of human rights. He then pointed out that 'over the last three decades and more of China's reform and opening era, China has made enormous progress in its human rights. World leaders have struggled for years to find appropriate ways to maintain positive relations with the Dalai Lama while remaining loyal to China, which often punishes countries whose heads show favoritism to the exiled cultural and spiritual icon. China suspended high-level diplomatic ties with Britain in 2012 for the next year in response to British Prime Minister Cameron and Deputy PM Nick Clegg's decision to meet with the Dalai Lama in London. Afterward, Cameron refused to apologize for the face to face discussion, but he did promise not to visit with His Holiness again any time soon. China also broke off diplomatic communications with Norway after it awarded a Chinese dissident the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010. Seeking to avoid a new confrontation with China, Norwegian officials refused to see the Dalai Lama earlier this year when he came to the country to celebrate the 25th anniversary of his own Nobel Prize. After German Chancellor Angela Merkel entertained the exiled Tibetan leader in 2007, China bowed out of forthcoming meeting in the country on the protection of intellectual property rights 'for technical reasons.' Likewise, China called off a summit with the European Union  in 2008 after then-French President and EU head Nicolas Sarkozy agreed to meet the Dalai Lama and other Nobel Prize winners while in Poland. President Barack Obama has met with the Dalai Lama three times since taking office. And while the Chinese government has responded with outrage every time, the U.S. has not been shunned the way European countries have fit its actions. 'Internationally, if Beijing does not show anger or protest in the strongest terms, the fear is that many heads of states will meet the Dalai Lama,' Wenran Jiang, a professor of political science professor at the University of Alberta, told CNN after Obama's first meeting with His Holiness. 'So Chinese leaders want to show as much disincentives as possible, even though they know they cannot stop such meetings.' 'That is a fact recognized by all the people in the world,' he added, according to a White House transcript of the press conference. That said, 'we should never consider our work to be mission accomplished,' Xi told reporters. 'It's always work in progress, and there is always room for further improvement. 'China stands ready to have dialogue with the United States on human rights issues on the basis of equality and mutual respect so that we can constructively handle our differences, deepen our mutual understanding, and learn from each other.' The U.S. has always walked a tightrope in regards to its relations with both China, a fellow world power that holds a significant amount of U.S. debt, and Tibet, whom it recognizes has been mistreated at the hands of the Chinese. Since a 1959 uprising in Tibet, the country's leader has lived in exile in India. China has subsequently painted him as a subversive whom the international community cannot trust. The Dalai Lama professes non-violence in the battle for autonomy in his native region, but the Chinese say he is a 'wolf in sheep's clothing' and privately supports a violent takeover. 'The Dalai is definitely not a pure religious figure. He is using the cloak of religion to engage in long-term activities to separate China. He is a political exile,' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement preceding the February 2014 meeting. Meanwhile, human rights groups have accused China of using perverted methods themselves to keep Tibet's residents in line. The U.S. State Department even issued a report in 2012 acknowledging the abuses and noted that 'the government’s respect for and protection of human rights...deteriorated markedly' in the preceding year. 'Under the banner of maintaining social stability, the government engaged in the severe repression of Tibet’s unique religious, cultural, and linguistic heritage by, among other means, strictly curtailing the civil rights of China’s ethnic Tibetan population, including the freedoms of speech, religion, association, and movement,' reads the State Department's report. 'Other serious human rights abuses included extrajudicial killings, torture, arbitrary arrests, extrajudicial detentions, and house arrests,' it said. According to Reuters, more than 120 Tibetans - mostly monks and nuns - have protested China's brutal rule of the territory by lighting themselves of fire. Smile for the cameras: President Xi and Obama participate in a welcoming ceremony at the Great Hall of the People upon Obama's arrival . The U.S. and China have long been on shaky terms and Obama has tried to bolster the relationship by staying neutral in the country's dispute with Tibet while acknowledging that parent country has oppressed and abused Tibet's people . During the Dalai Lama's visit to Washington, D.C. nine months ago, then-White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters the Obama administration was 'concerned about continuing tensions and that the deteriorating human rights situation in Tibetan areas of China.' As such, the Obama spokesman said, 'We will continue to urge the Chinese government to resume dialogue with the Dalai Lama or his representatives without pre-conditions as a means to reduce tensions.' The visit marked the third time the president had invited the 'internationally respected religious and cultural leader' to the White House since taking office. Previously the Dalai Lama and Obama met in February of 2010 and July of 2011. After the 2010 meeting, the Dalai Lama was photographed leaving 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue unceremoniously through a side door, where piles of not yet disposed trash were heaped in the snow. This year photographers never said the Nobel Peace Prize laureate coming or going. However, the White House said the meeting was held in the Map Room - not the prestigious Oval Office where the president usually holds important meetings and entertains world leaders. No U.S. president has ever sat down with the Dalai Lama in the Oval Office, the White House has said. The snubs are ostensibly meant to cool tensions with the Chinese over the assignations, though the White House refused in February to go on the record with an explanation. 'We don't have photographers in every meeting the president has,' Carney told inquiring reporters.","Obama said he encouraged Chinese authorities 'to take steps to preserve the unique cultural, religious and linguistic identity of the Tibetan people'

"Britain’s beleaguered Passport Office will be taken over by the Government to avoid a repeat of this summer's travel chaos, it was announced today. Home Secretary Theresa May announced the move in the wake of two damning reports into the agency's failings - after it allowed its application backlog to spiral out of control putting thousands of family holidays in jeopardy. It also comes after the influential Home Affairs Select Committee urged the Government to strip the Passport Office of its independent status. Pictures leaked to MailOnline, showing hundreds of boxes of applications piled on the floor of a Passport Office in Liverpool, piled pressure on the Government to introduce emergency measures to tackle the backlog . The Passport Office was accused of putting holidaymakers’ summer plans in jeopardy as it struggled to cope with demand and a backlog of applications in progress spiralled to 550,000. Ministers said the number of outstanding applications has now fallen to around 80,000. After the severity of the delays emerged, applicants booked to travel within seven days, whose applications had been with the Passport Office for longer than three weeks, were offered a free upgrade to the fast-track service. The Home Affairs Select Committee has called for all applicants who paid for the fast-track upgrade, prior to the contingency measures being introduced, to be compensated. A normal passport application costs £72.50, while the fast-track service costs £103. The Passport Office was established as an executive agency of the Home Office on May 13 last year. A similar move was made for the former UK Border Agency, which was abolished and brought back into the Home Office under control of ministers. The Passport Office will be scrapped as an arms-length ‘executive agency’ from October 1 and current chief executive Paul Pugh has effectively been sacked. He will remain in place until a successor - in the form of a Director General - is appointed. Passport Office chief executive Paul Pugh has effectively been sacked, but will stay in place until a replacement has been found . Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz called on the Government to return the Passport Office under the control of the Government . The Home Secretary said: ‘On June 12, I informed the House that I had asked the permanent secretary to conduct a review to consider whether HMPO’s agency status should be removed. ‘I have considered the review and relevant Cabinet Office guidance and decided that it should be brought into the Home Office and report directly to ministers. ‘As the events of the summer showed, it is essential that HMPO is run as efficiently as possible and is as accountable as possible. ‘I also know that its hard-working staff are committed to delivering a high-quality service to the public. ‘I believe these changes will put them in a stronger position to do so.’","Theresa May announces move in wake of report into the agency's failings .

'So it may not come as a surprise that he's been named as the most influential comedy icon, above other greats such as Rowan Atkinson and David Jason. 'Shows like Monty Python and Fawlty Towers will be watched by the nation for years to come, and the recent Monty Python live show proves how successful and popular it really is. 'Even those who are no longer around, such as Ronnie Barker, are leaving their stamp on comedy.' During the poll, half of those questioned said modern comedians were not as funny as classic comedy actors. Many described modern comedy as too crude, lacking in humour and full of bad language. The twelve-episode sitcom Fawlty Towers was first broadcast on BBC2 in 1975. The show was written by Cleese and his then-wife Connie Booth, both of whom also starred in the show. Monty Python's Flying Circus first aired on the BBC in 1969. Forty-five episodes were made over four series, before the show moved from the television series into stage shows, films,  albums and books.

"A mother has spoken of her distress at being told to lose weight for more than a decade before doctors realised her ballooning legs were the result of a genuine medical condition. Claire Tickle, now 38, first visited her GP at age 16 after noticing her legs had got so big it looked as though there was an elastic band around her ankle. For the next seven years she went back and forth to the doctor but was told she had big legs because she was overweight. Scroll down for video . Claire Tickle, 38, visited the doctor every year after the age of 16, worried her legs seemed to be growing faster than her body. She was repeatedly told she was overweight and to go on a diet . At the age of 32, Ms Tickle was eventually diagnosed with lipoedema, a condition which causes the legs to become enlarged. As the condition is incurable, her legs have now ballooned to 10-stone . Curiously, she noticed that when she went on a diet she could shed fat from her torso but her legs just kept on growing, she told ITV's This Morning. It was by sheer chance that aged 32, she was diagnosed with lipoedema – a condition which causes the legs, thighs, buttocks and arms to become enlarged. As the condition in incurable, her legs have now grown to 10 stone, leaving her in constant pain, having and unable to walk normally or play with her six-year-old son, Alfie. Her only hope is a new type of liposuction treatment being trialled, which she hopes will become available on the NHS soon. She told presenters Amanda Holden and Phillip Schofield: 'I was 16 when I noticed I had an elastic band effect around the bottom of each leg. ‘I went to my GP who looked at them and said I had water retention and to go away and try some dieting, which I did. ‘I lost loads of weight off my torso but not off my legs. It was getting bigger.’ She went back and forth to the doctor for years, with her legs growing at an alarming rate, but each time she was told to keep on with her diet. Lipoedema is the abnormal build-up of fat cells in the legs, thighs and buttocks. It causes the legs to become enlarged from the hips to the ankles but the feet are unaffected. The fat often creates a ring of fatty tissue overlapping the top the feet. The skin often feels cold and bruises easily. It can be very painful and can cause pain in the knees. Lipoedema occurs almost exclusively in women and tends to start during puberty or pregnancy. The accumulation of fat tends to be worse in people who are obese but also affects people who are a healthy weight and dieting does not help. The cause of the condition in unknown but there is often a family history in patients. The only treatment known to work is called tumescent liposuction but this is not currently available on the NHS. It involves numbing the legs before removing the excess fat. This treatment has been shown to be highly effective and has good long-term results. Source: NHS Choices . Being told repeatedly that she was fat caused her to become demoralised and lose hope. ‘I gave up in the end,' she said. 'I was told I was fat all the time,’ She believes it was only by sheer luck that she ever got a diagnosis. Six years ago, she was referred to a dermatologist about some eczema on the back of her legs. ‘As soon as I got my legs out for him to have a look at the eczema, he recognised straight away what was wrong with my them,' she recalled. Ms Tickle was instantly diagnosed with lipoedema, which some studies say affects as many as 11 per cent of women. Those with the condition have an excess number of fat cells in affected areas, as well as a build-up of fluid in those cells. The affected areas tend to feel softer and more doughy than normal fat, and may be tender to the touch, feel painful and bruise easily. It is not clear what causes it, though as it runs run in families, it is thought there is a genetic link. Doctors also believe there could be a hormonal trigger, as it often manifests itself after puberty or pregnancy. As Ms Tickle’s legs grew, they became more painful and began to seriously limit her life. ‘They’re painful every second of the day,’ she said. Ms Tickle says her condition leaves her in constant pain and with difficulty walking. She says it knocks her confidence as she feels people judge her harshly, believing she is 'just another overweight person' From the minute I get up, to the minute I go to bed, I’m in pain. I’m even in pain in my sleep.’ ‘I’ve got a young boy who’s six years old. I haven’t been able to do things that mums do and get on the floor and play. ‘I can’t run around in a park with him, I can’t get on a bike.’ She is judged harshly because she is so overweight, and people don’t realise she has a medical condition, she added. She said: ‘It knocks your confidence loads, because of your appearance. ‘The majority of people look at you and think you’re and overweight person. That’s even GPs, because they’re not educated about it.’ Previously, lipoedema was treated using massage and compression stockings, but a type of liposuction which targets fatty tissues in the legs is being trialled. Ms Tickle told ITV's This Morning presenters Phillip Schofield (far left) and Amanda Holden (left) that she 'gave up' after 10 years of doctors telling her she was fat . Ms Tickle is hoping she will be eligible for the treatment, but will need to lose as much of her ‘normal’ fat first, a task which is hard given her condition makes walking difficult. The treatment would dramatically change her life, she said. ‘It would be absolutely amazing not to wake up in pain every day.

"There are major concerns for more than a dozen Australians trekking in Nepal who have not been heard from since a blizzard and  avalanche hit the area, claiming the lives of at least 29 people. The death toll is expected to rise as search teams, hampered by bad weather, scour the snow and debris in the areas hit by the storms. Rescue members carry the dead bodies of trekkers from the Thorung La mountain pass in Nepal, which was hammered by severe snowstorms and avalanches . The storm has claimed the lives of at least 29 people, and that number is expected to rise as search teams scour the snow and debris in the areas hit by the storms . The severe storm was caused by the tail end of Cyclone Hudhud, which hammered southern India over the weekend. Many of those who have died during the storm are foreigners. A spokesperson for The Department of Foreign Affairs has told Daily Mail Australia 'the Australian Embassy in Kathmandu is in close and on-going contact with Nepalese authorities following the snow storm in the Annapurna region on Tuesday 14 October.' 'Our Embassy is actively seeking information about the welfare and whereabouts of Australians possibly in the affected area. 'Embassy staff remain ready to assist any Australians affected by this tragedy. Nepalese authorities continue to advise there are no reports of Australian casualties, so far.' Amongst the missing Australians are Melbourne brothers David and John Hallford from Melbourne. The Sydney Morning Herald has reported the pair had been trekking without a guide in the days leading up to the storm. The last post on John Hallford Facebook reads: . 'Tomorrow we flight out to the Himalaya foothills, escape from our phones and start our long trek. Cya soon friends and family' Fears are also high for Nicole Wise, a Sydney woman who was trekking with a Sherpa in the area hit by the storm. Sydney woman Nicole Wise was trekking with a Sherpa in the area hit by the storm. Her boyfriend Bazil Plumb says he has been told Ms Wise has been rescued from the area, but he has yet to hear from her directly . Amongst the missing Australians are Melbourne brothers David and John Hallford from Melbourne, who had been trekking without a guide in the days leading up to the storm . British woman Lizi Hamer (pictured left in each photograph) and her New Zealand partner Lisa Walton are among those feared missing after becoming caught in the avalanche in the Annapurna Range in Nepal . Bazil Plumb, Wise's partner, said he last spoke to her last Saturday, but has since received word she has been rescued. 'She has contacted someone at at Thorong Phedi village', Plumb says. 'The Sherpa she was with called for help yesterday morning, and his brother passed the message on to someone on the mountain.' 'I managed to contact this person today and they said she has been found and airlifted to safety.' He says he was overjoyed at the news. 'I felt so relieved, I hadn't heard from anyone at all and was stressing so much. I've been watching all these bodies and tourists on television: I've barely slept. I thought I lost my girl.' Plumb says he has been contacting the Department of Foreign Affairs, numerous trekking companies and rescue crews and missing person lists.' While the news today is uplifting, Plumb remains anxious that he has yet to hear from her. 'I can't get too excited as I haven't heard from her. I have taken the news with a grain of salt but it was awesome hearing news about her.' A New Zealand national, Lisa Walton, and her British partner Lizi Hamer are also feared missing.

"Ben Morgan insists England have to be ready to put their bodies on the line against the South Africa at Twickenham on Saturday, but warns muscle alone will not be enough to underpin a first victory of the autumn. The Springboks have been described as 'the big green machine' by England attacking coach Mike Catt, while prop Joe Marler assessed the challenge awaiting in the second QBE International by stating 'their DNA is run hard and if that doesn't work then run harder'. 'We know South Africa are a big, physical team who like to use route one, so we have to use our smarts to move them around and create mismatches,' the Gloucester No 8 said. Ben Morgan throws a pass at England training as Stuart Lancaster's side prepare for South Africa . The No 8 says England are ready to take on the Springboks' massive forward pack . 'We want to get South Africa running around the field chasing us. If we can do that and take our opportunities, we'll come out on top. 'If we carry into narrow channels then that's exactly what they'll want. They'll line us up from 10 metres away and come charging at us. But if we can shift the point of attack, it can make the world of difference. 'Not only does it give you the one-on-one carries that everyone wants, but it means the defence is always moving around. If you hit them tight then they don't really move. 'But you can't get away from the fact you have to carry hard too. You won't always be able to put those passes in, you have to front up and go through the line. 'Taking big hits takes it out of you, but we're advanced enough as a team to move around and cope with that sort of stuff. 'There are quite a few Premiership matches that have ended in a slogging match, so we've gone all though that type of game. We know what we're up against this weekend.' Morgan's first exposure to the Springboks was the 2012 summer tour when England were swept aside in the first two Tests before recovering to earn a 14-14 draw in Port Elizabeth. Lancaster puts England through their paces as he looks to open their Autumn International account . Springboks' veteran Victor Matfield prepares as his side look to bounce back from defeat by Ireland . The 25-year-old has now amassed 24 caps and he can see the progress made since the first trip abroad of Stuart Lancaster's reign. 'For many of us that was our first tour and it was a real learning curve. I was very green back then and I've come a long way since,' Morgan said. 'I'm a lot more experienced and have learnt a lot of lessons through winning and losing. There were also the experience of going through that difficult patch with Gloucester last year. 'I'm definitely more rounded and I know what I have to do now. I'm better defensively, which has changed with experience.' Morgan is likely to continue in his role as No 8 reinforcement to Billy Vunipola when Lancaster names his starting XV on Thursday morning. Vunipola faded in the 24-21 defeat by New Zealand, but, while there are concerns over his fitness at international level, the 22-year-old looks set to profit from Lancaster's desire to give the same 23 another chance. England stretch out in training after their 24-21 loss to New Zealand on Saturday . Billy Vunipola looks set to start again at No 8, with Morgan to come off the bench with fresh legs . 'Obviously I want to start every game. I don't want to be a bench player, but Billy's been playing well and if I can make an impact coming off the bench then I want to do that,' Morgan said. 'If you start you walk on to the pitch with the intention of playing the 80 minutes, but that doesn't mean you leave anything in the tank. Basically you go out there and empty the tank. 'With the likes of myself and Billy, it's good to know someone else can step off the bench and give as much as they can.' Semesa Rokoduguni has been ruled out with a thigh problem, so Marland Yarde has been drafted into the squad as wing cover and is competing with Anthony Watson to start in the number 14 jersey. An injury doubt hangs over flanker Tom Wood, who England say is suffering from general soreness after the All Blacks game, so James Haskell is on standby as his replacement.","England face South Africa in Saturday's international at Twickenham .

"Job security is an issue that concerns us all, but particularly so if you’re a football manager. Arsene Wenger, though, doesn’t have to worry. Win, lose or draw, the Frenchman’s job is safe as houses. No danger. How many managers have that luxury in the Barclays Premier League? None, probably. Rightly or wrongly, Wenger has made himself untouchable in north London. Arsenal's Nacho Monreal, Lukas Podolski and Tomas Rosicky (left to right) trudge off the pitch after Arsenal threw away a three-goal lead to draw with Anderlecht in the Champions League . Arsene Wenger, pictured a the Leaders Sport Performance Summit at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday, is fully secure in his position as Arsenal boss despite the club's recent poor form . That notion has split opinion among supporters. There are those who remember the good times, the Premier League titles, the FA Cups and the Invincibles. But there are those who cannot forgot about the barren years; those who are fed up with the club’s perennial underachievement. Last season’s FA Cup triumph against Hull - their first trophy in nine seasons - was quickly followed by the announcement of Wenger’s new three-year contract. Aaron Ramsey’s extra time Wembley winner was supposed to herald a new era of Wenger domination. Aleksandar Mitrovic looks ecstatic after scoring Anderlecht's last-minute equaliser at the Emirates . Wenger speaks to the conference during the Leaders Sport Performance Summit at the Emirates Stadium . On the back of two disappointing results, both in which they inexplicably gave away leads, that dream of a dominant Arsenal seems a world away. Wenger has already thrown in the towel in the title race, while the Gunners look destined for a second place finish in their Champions League group, meaning they are likely to meet one of Europe’s superpowers in the last 16. Apply a similar scenario at, say, Chelsea or Manchester City. Would Jose Mourinho or Manuel Pellegrini have the same level of job security? Probably not. Unless Wenger decides to walk away from the Emirates Stadium (and he has been very open with his views on breaking contracts), the Frenchman will remain at the helm until at least 2017. But that’s not to say there isn’t any forward planning in place at Arsenal. The club are certainly planning for life without Wenger; keeping abreast, doing their research, on the best emerging managerial talent in Europe. Wenger and former England cricket head coach Andy Flower (right) were both at the Leaders Summit . Santi Cazorla attempts to help Alexis Sanchez off the turf after Arsenal's 3-3 draw with Anderlecht . There are the obvious candidates: Borussia Dortmund’s Jurgen Klopp, Germany manager Joachim Low and Bayern Munich’s Pep Guardiola. Then there are the less obvious, Mainz’s former manager Thomas Tuchel (currently unemployed) has caught the eye, while Everton’s Roberto Martinez and Ajax’s Frank De Boer are also being studied. They’ve even researched managers in the obscure Austrian Bundesliga to have a succession plan in place once Wenger calls it a day. The Gunners board know Wenger’s reign is in its final throws, and want to make sure they have the right man. An aerial view of the conference at the Emirates which Wenger (back right) spoke at on Wednesday . Arsenal watched on with interest to see how Manchester United would deal with the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson. The Old Trafford club’s demise has certainly not gone unnoticed by the powers that be at the Emirates. And the Gunners know they cannot afford a similar plight and are determined to get their next managerial appointment right. They don’t want to make a ‘flavour of the month’ appointment. They have two-and-and-half years worth of homework still to do ensure they make the correct appointment. In saying that, who’s to say Wenger won’t want to carry on past his 67th birthday?

"A Florida mother is fighting for custody of her son - after he was taken into care by state officials who feared her vegan diet would harm the boy's health. Sarah Markham of Orlando's baby was taken away from her at the age of 12 days in June after she refused to take her to hospital when he began to lose weight. Instead, she told police that she wanted to feed her baby a vegan formula. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Faces criminal charges: Sarah Markham is fighting for custody of her son after he was taken away because she tried giving him vegan baby formula instead of following doctor's orders . Taken away: Markham wanted to giver baby a vegan formula instead of breast milk . Caretaker or criminal?: Markham is only allowed to see her son during supervised visits and and only sees him a few times a week, according to Seminole County Child Protective Services . Markham was arrested in June when her son was less than two weeks old. Now she's trying to win back her child and faces criminal child neglect charges. WFTV reports that Markham's baby had lost 10 percent of his body weight and doctors told her to take the baby to the hospital. She wanted to supply the baby with vegan formula instead of breast milk to see if would help the baby gain any weight. Markham is a Christian Seventh-day Adventist and holistic healing is in her system of beliefs. Because of her choice not to take her son to the hospital, Markham is only allowed to see her son during supervised visits and she can only see him a few times a week, according to Seminole County Child Protective Services. 'They've kept a child away from a mom,' said attorney Mark O'Mara to WFTV. 'My client can only see her child once a week or twice a week because they're requiring the child be out of the county,' he said. O'Mara said that Markham's parenting was 'not even close' to child neglect. 'It's absurd. It's a mom trying to do the best she can, acting as a vegan which she has the entire right to do taking care of her child,' he said. Markham’s son is now healthy and she is willing to do anything she can to get him back. 'She has done everything they've asked her to do: Mental health evaluations, drug evaluations, parenting classes, everything they've asked her to do she's done, and she's done it very well, and yet we have to go to trial on this tomorrow. It's absurd,' said O'Mara.

"The hand of friendship extended down the paddock on Thursday, one Brit to another — world champion to world champion — when Lewis Hamilton told McLaren they do not need a new driver but a new car. It was some kind of balm to Jenson Button as he sat in Interlagos, the place where he once spent the happiest moment of his life — hugging his father after winning the title in 2009 — but now contemplating the end of his Formula One career. Button is about to be released by McLaren to be replaced by Fernando Alonso after the final race in Abu Dhabi in a fortnight, hence he can hardly understand it, having outscored his team-mate Kevin Magnussen 94-53. Jenson Button is all smiles as he speaks with members of the media ahead of the Brazilian Grand Prix . Lewis Hamilton won the US Grand Prix with ease last week and looks set to win the drivers' championship . But Eric Boullier, McLaren’s racing director, wants a blend of youth — Magnussen is 22 — and experience. Alonso is 34 and a double world champion. Hamilton, who spent three years with Button as McLaren team-mates, was equally astonished by the news. He said: ‘JB’s going? Really? Surely Jenson can go anywhere? Jenson is better than most of the drivers. 'He’s a great driver. He’s had an amazing career and he’s still one of the strongest drivers here, so it doesn’t correlate. If I had a team, I would want him in it. He’s a great asset. ‘He’s smart and fast. He’s also just a decent guy. He’s still got plenty of time as a driver to keep racing and winning. Hamilton has backed Button to remain at McLaren and says they should change the car rather than him . ‘He just needs to be given a better car. It’s not that the team need a better driver. There are not many out there.’ The two men are not bosom friends and Button has had cause to be annoyed by Hamilton’s erratic behaviour in the past, but there is mutual respect between them as racers. Will Hamilton’s endorsement change anyone’s mind at McLaren? Even if it did, would Button want to stay? ‘I can’t answer that question,’ said Button, hinting at an irrevocable breakdown in relations with the team. ‘When you’re put in a position that many drivers have been put in over the years it opens your eyes to different challenges, whether it’s racing, doing another sport or something altogether different. Hamilton says Button is better than most of the drivers on the circuit and could still go anywhere . ‘I’m excited about the challenges ahead. I have a lot of different ideas. ‘Formula One and motor racing have been a massive part of my life and it’s not going to stop. I just don’t know where that’s going to be right now. 'I never feel like I’m being pushed out of the sport because I’m definitely going to be in the sport in some form.’ Button, 34, clearly wants to race, and not primarily for the seven-figure salary he would command with one of the big teams — Audi, Porsche or Toyota — in the World Endurance Championship, which is his most likely refuge. That would allow him to combine his driving commitments with broadcasting on Formula One, although he seems uninterested in a television career at the moment. More than anything he wants a winning car, something McLaren have not provided him with since their last victory two years ago to this very race. Button celebrates clinching the F1 championship in Brazil in 2009 . ‘We are not winning races,’ he said. ‘When Lewis and I were team-mates, we were winning seven or eight between us every year. Now we don’t have a car that is quick enough. The team know that and that is why we are working bloody hard to improve. ‘It isn’t going to stop until the last race; we have new parts for Abu Dhabi which will hopefully help the car. Two years of not winning is too long.’ Button’s departure will reduce the number of British drivers, possibly to just one: Hamilton. Max Chilton’s Marussia team are in administration and although they are hopeful of finding investors, there is no guarantee he would keep his place. Several drivers bring sponsorship to pay for their drives, as Chilton does. ‘It is worrying,’ said Button, who earns about £10million against Magnussen’s £500,000. ‘There are fewer and fewer teams hiring drivers on pure talent. Unless you have a big bucket of gold, you are not going to get into Formula One and that has been proved by some of the signings we have seen for next season. ‘Obviously the manufacturers hire on merit, but after that it is a case of money talks rather than skill. ‘That is sad considering it is the pinnacle of motorsport.’ Button spoke like the elder statesman of the sport he is. He might be bitter at his treatment by McLaren, but otherwise he was content as he talked about his future and his past with a smile on his face.

"They won't be walking down the aisle after all. Robin Wright, 48, and Ben Foster, 34, have ended their 10-month engagement, according to a Wednesday report from UsWeekly. 'She got swept up in the engagement last Christmas, but then their schedules got crazy and she realized it wasn't the right decision,' a source told the publication. Scroll down for video . No wedding bells for these two: Robin Wright has ended her 10-month engagement to actor Ben Foster, who she is seen with here in January, according to a Wednesday report from UsWeekly . The couple's age difference - she is 14 years older - turned out to be a major issue. The ex-wife of Sean Penn (who is now dating Charlize Theron) felt as if Ben was just 'too immature' a source added. 'The gap just ended up being too much,' an insider revealed. 'Ben was kind of immature. She couldn't deal with him anymore.' The loves of her life: The 48-year-old star with Dylan Penn (left) and Hopper Penn (right) at the Emmy Awards at LA Live in 2013 . Once in step: Robin and Sean, pictured at the NYC premiere of The Interpreter in 2005, were married from 1996 to 2010 . And the couple - they met on set of their 2011 film Rampart - were also working in separate cities, which created an emotional distance. Robin was shooting the Netflix show House of Cards in Baltimore while Ben was in London doing A Streetcar Named Desire on stage. During her downtime, Wright liked to visit her children - Dylan, 23, and Hopper Jack, 21 (their father is Penn) - in Los Angeles. Her hit series: The blonde beauty with Kevin Spacey (center) and Michel Gill (far left) in House Of Cards, which has been filming in Baltimore . Before Sean, who she wed in 1996 and divorced in 2010, Robin was married to Dane Witherspoon. Meanwhile, Penn (who was once wed to Madonna) just returned from South Africa where he directed his 39-year-old love Theron in the love story The Last Face. Javier Bardem and Jean Reno also star. In August model Dylan, who used to date Robert Pattinson, said of her father and the bombshell: 'They're a great couple. They're both very happy and, yeah, I love it.' They seem to be on solid ground: Penn, 54, with Charlize, 39, landing at LAX airport after finishing shooting The Last Face in South Africa . She added, 'They're both extremely strong personalities and they're very intelligent, so conversation lasts between them.' In February Robin broke her silence on her divorce from Sean. The Forrest Gump star told a British paper, 'Divorce in and of itself, and with children, is devastating. Worse than that. 'One of the reasons why we got back together and broke up so much was trying to keep the family together. If you've got kids, it's a family, and you try again, and you try again. We did that for a long time.'","Robin, 48, became engaged to Ben, 34, in December after a year of dating .

"Dramatic footage of tragic James Bond stuntman Mark Sutton giving the thumbs up literally seconds before he dies has been released. The poignant video was taken from inside a helicopter as he prepared to jump out of it in a wingsuit. Released with the full consent of his family, the heartrending film shows Mark, 42, leaping from the helicopter to his death. Thumbs up: Mark Sutton gives the camera a gesture of approval before he exits the helicopter for what was to be his final jump . He died 20 seconds later. Mark, who wowed crowds as 007 at the Olympics opening ceremony, crashed into a mountain ridge at a speed of 155 mph. He was one of 23 world-class wingsuit pilots taking part in a non-competitive event in August in Trient, Switerland, near the French town of Chamonix. The event - HeliBASE 74 - was organised by EpicTV, an online extreme sports channel that has since made a series of films about it. Panu Lehti, Head of EpicTV, said: ‘When Mark died we were devastated and planned to shelve the whole project. 'But when the other pilots showed us that the best way to remember Mark was to think about what he would have wanted, we decided to go ahead with the series. One jump: Wearing patriotic blue, red and white, Mr Sutton looks out over the Alps . Ready: Although he observes the cloudiness below, Mark leaps off the helicopter . Final moment: Mark Sutton died seconds after this was filmed, aged 42, in the Swiss Alps . Incredible views: The helmet cameras of Mr Sutton's teammates capture the amazing heights they reach as they leap out of the helicopter . ‘We knew it would be difficult for his . family so before publishing this episode we showed it to his brother . Steve. It feels good to know we have the family behind us. HeliBASE 74 . is dedicated to the memory of Mark Sutton and to the strength of his . family and friends as well.’ Tragedy . struck on the first day of the event. It was Mark’s first jump. He was . partnered in the helicopter with another British wingsuiter, Tony . Uragallo. Moments from death: Sutton's bright wingsuit is visible as he falls through the sky in this grab from the video . The world-class stuntman tragically died moments after this video was shot . In the film, Tony movingly describes how the tragedy unfolded. He says: ‘Everyone is having a good time. It’s so nice to get out above a mountain. Normally we have to climb a mountain. ‘Mark suggested I follow him and I thought ‘that’s great’, because he’s a much better base jumper than me. ‘He’s right there, looking at me, looking at the spot. He’s telling the pilot ‘right, left, bit more, bit more…’ Nervous: In the last piece of footage before his crash Mr Sutton expresses his concerns about the foggy conditions at the beginning of the scheduled day's jump . Poignant: In another scene Mark Sutton, centre in black jacket, is shown listening with his fellow pilots to the safety briefing given before the group start their jumps . Mark was one of 23 world-class wingsuit pilots taking part in a non-competitive event in August in Trient, Switerland . Mark, dressed in his red, white and blue wingsuit, can be seen edging along the back seat of the chopper towards the open door. He gestures to the pilot to veer right then puts his right thumb up and climbs out of the helicopter. Mark launches himself off the side of the helicopter and he is seen free falling, followed closely by Tony. Footage shows two colourful specks plummeting through the cloud. Tony . says: ‘He turns and he jumps and I just followed him. He can follow the . terrain a lot better than me and I’ll just follow his line. ‘And then he just suddenly turned left real quick. And I couldn’t believe it.’ Tony is then seen landing in a field. He . says: ‘I landed close to everyone and I shouted out: ‘Mark hit the . mountain.’ That destroys everything. Everybody is so upset.

"A Russian man who entered his new flat for the first time, walked in to find the previous tenant murdered in the bathroom. Taras Yermolayev, 45, found the dead body of alleged drug dealer Dementi Zakharov, 50, lying in a pool of blood and the flat ransacked and 'smashed up with a sledge hammer'. Mr Yermolayev had met up with Mr Zakharov just one day earlier to pick up the keys for his new apartment in Novokuznetsk in south central Russia. Mr Yermolayev says the flat  had been put on the market after Mr Zakharov had stopped paying the rent, so the owner  had decided to sell it. He had then purchased it from a online advert without even visiting it, telling police that the price was so cheap he had wanted to act quickly to make sure he grabbed a bargain. He said: 'It was terrifying when I saw the body, like the stuff from a horror movie. 'The place looked like someone had smashed it up with a sledge hammer and then done the same to the previous tenant. 'His head looked like it had been severely battered and I didn't even recognise if the body was that of a man or woman at first. 'I immediately called the police and then vomited in the kitchen sink.' When police arrived they sealed off the apartment and began questioning neighbours.\n\n . A police spokesman said: 'There are signs that the victim had been tortured before being murdered. 'He is known to us as a drug dealer and we suspect this was some sort of revenge attack connected to his business. 'So far the neighbours say they didn't hear anything.' Now Mr Yermolayev says he has no intention of moving in and wants to sell the place. He said: 'There's no way I'm going to ever feel comfortable living here knowing what happened. 'I plan to sell up as soon as the police have finished their investigation and I can get someone in to clean up this mess. 'I don't envy them.'","Russian man found former tenant dead in the bathroom .

"The Prince of Wales got a little closer to nature than he bargained for when the heavens opened as he toured a park in the centre of a London housing estate this morning. Despite the downpour, the royal, who took shelter under a large black umbrella, was on jolly form and smiled broadly as he chatted to locals. As he toured Arlington Gardens, the centrepiece of the Packington Estate in London's Islington, Charles was also introduced to a young well-wisher, one-year-old Louis Egerton-Smith - much to the Prince's delight. Wet weather: The Prince of Wales had to take shelter under an umbrella thanks to a heavy downpour . Hello there: Prince Charles looks delighted as he is introduced to young well-wisher Louis Egerton-Smith . Charles was at the Packington Estate  to get a closer look at a regeneration project run by apprentices funded by The Prince's Trust. The programme, called Get Into Construction, is a short intensive course for young unemployed people who want to work in building and aims to give them the confidence and skills they need for success. As well as classroom time, teenagers and young adults taking part are sent out on placements, one of which is at the Packington Estate regeneration site. Built in the 1960s, the Packington Estate is currently being redeveloped by the Hyde Group who are replacing the old housing blocks and improving the communal areas, among them Arlington Gardens. Fascinating stuff: Charles takes a closer look at the Arlington Gardens regeneration project . All smiles: Charles beamed as he chatted to locals and apprentices sponsored by The Prince's Trust . At ease: The Prince of Wales appeared to be in his element as he toured the London estate . Nice to meet you: Brunei's Major General Dato Paduka Seri Haji Aminuddin Ihsan meets the Queen . Formal: Major General Ihsan presented his papers as he became Brunei's new High Commissioner . Now seven years into the project, 435 new homes have been built, including a mixture of modern apartments along the Regent’s Canal and a terrace of elegant, classing Islington Town houses. But while Charles has long taken an interest in the built environment, it was meeting the apprentices sponsored by the Prince's Trust that appeared to give him the most pleasure. Charles, who is fresh from a successful tour of Mexico and Colombia, was in his element as he chatted to the apprentices, and became animated as they discussed planting. While Charles was getting wet in Islington, the Queen was busy at Buckingham Palace where she held audiences for two new ambassadors. Resplendent in an elegant salmon pink dress, Her Majesty was all smiles as she greeted His Excellency Major General Dato Paduka Seri Haji Aminuddin Ihsan, Brunei's new High Commissioner. Major General Ihsan was followed by  Jules-Armand Aniambossou, the new Ambassador from the Republic of Benin. Elegant: The Queen looked wonderful in a salmon pink ensemble teamed with a delicate pearl necklace . Swearing in: Next to meet the Queen was Jules-Armand Aniambossou, the new ambassador from Benin . Chat: The new ambassador appeared to enjoy his meeting with Her Majesty and chatted happily .

"Stewart Downing has admitted he thought his England career was over before earning a recall by Roy Hodgson. The West Ham player's last cap came in May 2012 and although he went to that summer's European Championships he failed to get any minutes and has not been close to a call-up since. But his improved from under Sam Allardyce, sparked by a change in position from wing to midfield, has got him back in the international fold – and he wants to play against Slovenia at Wembley on Saturday. Stewart Downing, pictured in England training on Tuesday, feared his international career was over . Downing earned a recall to Roy Hodgson's squad after his fine form for West Ham this season . Downing is hoping to take his chance if he is given a start in Saturday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia . 'I've admitted in the past I felt my chance had passed, but I kept going and always kept trying to play well,' said Downing, 30. 'It's paid off. Roy has been watching the games and picked me. I'm very happy to be back. 'There is a lot of new talent coming through. I do feel a bit old. But he's got a good mixture here. I was a little bit nervous coming in. But it's exciting. There is some great talent. 'Every time I watch Raheem Sterling at Liverpool he seems to get better and better. Adam Lallana is someone I've not played with. They've impressed me with some good touches in training. 'The system change has helped (earn a recall). Playing in the middle adds a new dimension and I'm really enjoying it. I've got to continue my good performances and take my chance when given it.' Downing (centre) admits he has been impressed with Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling (right) Roy Hodgson gave Downing a chance after watching him help West Ham go fourth in the Premier League . Downing paid tribute to Allardyce and West Ham as a team. 'Roy has been impressed with how we've adapted to a new way of playing,' he added. 'That's why he's called me up. I need to maintain that form. I spoke to Roy a couple of times. At West Ham games he's been in the changing room with the manager and we spoke very briefly. He said, 'Yes you're going to get in the squad.' 'I'm here to play and perform, not just make the numbers up. I'm itching to get out there.' West Ham sit fourth in the table and have beaten Manchester City and Liverpool this season. Downing hopes the side can stay in the European places but admitted: 'It will obviously be difficult. We have to be realistic. But we've had a great start, which we wanted to do. 'The one we're playing we don't fear anyone and we feel we can beat anyone on our day. That's the attitude we have to take into every game from now until the end of the season.'

"Chelsea are the team to stop, but they will be nervous. With their firepower and their quality, they are ripe for this title… but they haven’t got away from Manchester City, who have had to deal with poor form and injuries to key players. They will want to get an early trophy back at Stamford Bridge to ease the pressure, so I expect them to take the Capital One Cup. Jose Mourinho did his business early in the window and all three players – Cesc Fabregas, Diego Costa and Thibaut Courtois – have been terrific. Courtois is the best goalkeeper in the Barclays Premier League. I wish they would stop calling it on about diving. You usually get the reputation you deserve. Chelsea Goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois has proved to be the best in the Premier League . Chelsea have been unable to shake off the challenge of Manchester City going into the New Year . Costa would pick a fight with his best mate. So it’s no surprise to see he has history with one of Thursday's opponents. Federico Fazio of Spurs traded blow with Costa when Sevilla played Atletico Madrid, so be ready for a tear up. My money is on Costa, because he loves a scrap and is made for this league. I said it at the start that he would fit in and he has looked at home. He is a beast of a centre forward . Diego Costa grapples with Federico Fazio during their La Liga days . Costa has proved he is made for the Premier League and is up for the fight . John Terry, Steven Gerrard and Dany Alves are free transfers worth looking at. Each player will be able to talk to foreign clubs once the transfer window opens. I expect Terry to stay – why would Chelsea let him go? He is getting better with age. It’s remarkable to think that Rafa Benitez tried to drive him out two seasons ago! Stevie is more interesting; he can still do a job for Liverpool and I hope he stays, but he may feel the criticism has become unbearable. If he does stay, I hope he settles down and just plays. There is too much ‘let’s make him a holding midfielder’, or ‘let’s push him forward’. Just let him play! Barcelona’s Alves isn’t the force he used to be, but at 31, he isn’t washed up yet. I expect English clubs to push hard. John Terry, Steven Gerrard and Dani Alves are all out of contract in the summer and free to talk to overseas clubs from the beginning of January . Mario Balotelli has the most shots without scoring in the whole of Europe. What a poor signing he has been for Liverpool. When he signed I wrote: ‘There is a reason why there are cheap sale at a supermarket’. People tell me he’s a good lad, despite what you may have read, but he’s not good enough technically to sustain a place in a top team. Mario Balotelli has had more shots in the league than anyone else in Europe without scoring . United are still short and I can't see them making it a three-horse race. They need two top defenders to make the jump. They have plenty of firepower, but a man on the street could turn that group of players into a winning team. They are still behind Chelsea and Manchester City in quality throughout the team. LVG has done okay and I expect them to make the top four. Manchester United are still short of some top defenders to challenge for the title . Angel di Maria has been good for United going forward - but they are still short at the back . Southampton are better equipped to finish higher than West Ham. I don’t see them making the top four, but I can see them making the top six. They have to keep Morgan Schneiderlin or they might finish as low as 10th. He is that important to them. If they sell him in this window, they might as well wave the white flag. Morgan Schneiderlin is key to Southampton finishing high up the table . Alex Song and Stewart Downing have been excellent. West Ham are a changed team. They have played exciting, entertaining football and Song has made a real impact. Having someone like him in the team has helped Downing and his confidence is high. Recruitment at West Ham has been excellent and finishing in the top eight should be considered successful. Alex Song and Stewart Downing have both been star performers for West Ham . The player of the season so far has been Cesc Fabregas. At Barcelona, he looked off the boil. He wasn’t sharp, he was in and out of the team and he was played in different roles. At Chelsea, he looks reborn and a joy to watch. Cesc Fabregas has been one of the best signings this season and been a key player for Chelsea . Wilfried Bony is the man to buy. Swansea will fight to keep him, or at least receive the biggest fee. He is a powerhouse who would improve any side, apart from the top two. And even City and Chelsea would benefit from having him in their squad. He’s a top-class goalscorer. Swansea City's Wilfried Bony could be a man in demand from a number of sides in the transfer window . Charlie Austin is a fairytale footballer. Non league players with hopes of making the big time will look at Charlie and believe their dreams can come true. What an impact he has made. If you had asked me before the start of the season, I’d have said he would struggle to get five goals. He already has 12. Charlie Austin has proved he can cut it in the Premier League after rising from non-League football . Harry Kane is another player who has surprised me. Tottenham are lucky to have him. He has come from nowhere and is helping them to make up for mistakes they have made in the transfer market. His goals have given them a chance of the top four. Kane has become their talisman and he leaves everything on the pitch. Spurs fans sing ‘he is one of us’, and he looks like a fan playing football. My boss said to me a few months ago: ‘Mention Harry Kane for England in your column.’ I laughed. I’m not laughing any more. Harry Kane has impressed since getting his chance at Spurs . Steve Bruce is struggling at Hull. They need to hold their nerve. He has brought in players who are all very similar and who don’t look capable of rolling up their sleeves. Michael Dawson was a good signing, but is injured and Tom Huddlestone and Jake Livermore are off the boil. They will be okay, I just hope the board doesn’t panic. Hull boss Steve Bruce is having a tough time at the KC Stadium - but they should be good enough to stay up . Roberto Martinez won’t change his style. Everton are also struggling and one or two of his players need to work harder, but Martinez believes in his way of playing and won’t mix it up. I’m a fan and I’m sure he will get it right. Roberto Martinez is unlikely to change his style at Everton - some of his players need to work harder . The best addition of the transfer window will be… Daniel Sturridge. Don’t underestimate the impact he will have on the Liverpool team when he returns later this month. If he can stay fit, they can beat Arsenal for fourth place. They’ve had a wretched first half of the season, but Liverpool are only five points off the top four and play bottom club Leicester today. Sturridge can turn their season around. Daniel Sturridge is due back from injury in the New Year .","Chelsea have not been able to pull away from Manchester City .

"A mother who faced the devastation of losing four babies in two years claims a 'mistake' by hospital staff 'damaged her womb'. Leanne Bilon, 30, said she has been warned she may never have another child. She and her husband Yane are today demanding answers from Croydon University Hospital, claiming a 'botched' delivery at its maternity ward triggered the tragic sequence of events. Mrs Bilon has accused the hospital of depriving her of precious moments with one of her sons, who midwives allegedly said had died hours before he actually did. A health watchdog is investigating the alleged failings, which Mrs Bilon, of Thornton Heath, south London, said have left her terrified of going to hospital. Leanne Bilon, 30, from Thornton Heath, has lost four babies in the last two years. The mother-of-three claims a mistake made by staff at Croydon University Hospital caused the tragedy . The 30-year-old is mother to two sons and a daughter, who were all born healthy. She was due to give birth to a third son, due to be called Eli, in 2012. On September 24, at almost 25 weeks' pregnant, Mrs Bilon experienced contractions and was taken to the hospital by ambulance. She claims nurses wrongly told her she was fully dilated and instructed her to begin pushing. Mrs Bilon said realising their mistake, staff then rushed her for an emergency Caesarean section to deliver the baby, but it was deemed too dangerous. 'I was wheeled back to delivery and left in the room alone while my baby died inside me,' she said. 'My baby was stillborn just hours later.' Mrs Bilon claims she was initially given no warning from hospital staff that pushing when not fully dilated could have damaged her cervix, and reduced her chances of giving birth safely. Then a year later, in 2013, she miscarried while she was 18 weeks' pregnant with twin girls. In January tragedy struck the couple for a fourth time, when they lost a second baby boy, Shay. In 2012, Mrs Bilon's baby boy Eli was stillborn. She then miscarried twin girls in 2013 and in January, a second baby boy, Shay, was born at 22 weeks but didn't survive . Bosses at Croydon University Hospital (pictured) have admitted some failings, but insist  maternity services have been 'transformed', with 'every lesson being learned' He was born 'gasping for breath' at just 22 weeks on January 19. 'I was told that even though his heart was beating it was just a flutter - he wasn't really alive,' said Mrs Bilon. 'So I said my goodbyes and they took him out of the room. They came back in the room at 3.15pm telling me my baby had just died. 'I couldn't believe it. I was disgusted that they led me to believe all that time that my son was dead. 'I would have stayed with him and held him on my chest.' Mrs Bilon has since been told she has at best a 40 per cent chance of giving birth successfully, forcing her to abandon hopes of another child with her husband. The couple, who have been married for four years, have lodged complaints against the hospital and its staff with the General Medical Council, the Nursing and Midwifery Council and the Parliamentary and Health Services Ombudsman, which are all investigating. A spokesperson for Croydon Health Services NHS Trust said: 'This is incredibly sad, and we have given our unreserved condolences to Mrs Bilon for the loss of her babies. 'We have thoroughly reviewed our care and sadly have not found anything that would have altered the outcome. 'We have shared all the findings of our investigations with Mrs Bilon, who we are continuing to try and support as best we can.' Zoe Packman, Director of Nursing, Midwifery and Allied Health Professionals, added: 'I would like to again express the Trust's sincere condolences to Mrs Bilon. 'Our maternity services have been transformed over recent years. In discussion with Mrs Bilon we want to make sure every lesson is learned to keep improving our care.'","Leanne Bilon lost her son Eli in 2012, 25 weeks into her pregnancy .

"Out with the old and in with the new. Warren Gatland’s loyalty towards his British and Irish Lions has at times been painfully frustrating but the Wales coach insists his starting XV for Saturday’s Test against Australia has been picked purely on form. Fresh faces have been included in place of some ageing veterans, who may well have passed their peak. It could signal the turning point as Wales bid to end a run of 20 straight defeats against Australia, New Zealand and South Africa — the southern hemisphere’s ‘big three’. Warren Gatland has dropped four of his most experienced players for Saturday's Test against Australia . Ospreys scrum-half Rhys Webb will start against the Wallabies in place of veteran number nine Mike Philips . Adam Jones, the 95-cap tighthead prop, was left out of the squad completely, while 42-cap Bradley Davies and the Lions duo of Gethin Jenkins and Mike Phillips have been named on the bench. In come Samson Lee, 21, Jake Ball, 23, Rhys Webb, 25, and Paul James, who is 32 but enjoying a new lease of life with Bath. ‘The criticism that has been levelled at me in the past is that I’ve been stubborn and not made changes,’ said Gatland. ‘So if you look at Webb and Dan Biggar, they’ve been the form nine and 10 for the Ospreys and they’ve been selected on form. ‘For us, there is a lot of logic in the decisions we have made and we are pretty excited and positive about the selection. From my point of view, they are pretty justifiable.’ There was an air of inevitability about the head coach’s press conference at the Vale Resort yesterday. Having not beaten a southern hemisphere side since the 21-18 win against the Wallabies in 2008, questions about ‘psychological barriers’ have become commonplace over the last few series of autumn internationals. After that last victory, Gatland said his side were carrying the flag for the northern hemisphere. Six years later and the flag is at half mast. There have been moments of celebration — notably two Grand Slams, a World Cup semi-final and, most recently, a heavily Wales-influenced Lions Test series victory — but that all seemed like distant memories after this summer’s 38-16 thumping by South Africa in Durban. Veteran Wales and Lions loosehead Gethin Jenkins has been dropped for Bath prop Paul James . Jake Ball (right), in action against England in March, will line up alongside Alun Wyn-Jones at lock . ‘Our primary focus over the next 12 months has to be getting out of our group in the World Cup,’ said Gatland. ‘Although we want to do exceptionally well in the autumn and Six Nations and those are important games for us, the long-term objective is getting out of that group and making the quarter-finals.’ Some of Gatland’s newer faces will not carry the fear that becomes engrained by defeat after defeat and this weekend is the best opportunity for a major autumn scalp. Australia have a new coach, Michael Cheika, following their recent off-field controversies, and looked slack defensively in their narrow victory over the Barbarians on Saturday. Gatland, however, will not be caught cold. Halfpenny; Cuthbert, North, Roberts, Williams; Biggar, Webb; James, Hibbard, Lee; Ball, A W Jones; Lydiate, Warburton (capt), Faletau. Subs: Baldwin, Jenkins, R Jones, Davies, Tipuric, Phillips, Priestland, Allen. ‘You can’t underestimate them,’ said Gatland. ‘A lot of people have been talking about what’s happened with Kurtley Beale (he was fined £24,600 for sending an offensive picture message to an Australian Rugby Union female team official) and those sorts of things. Does that make them more vulnerable? With Australians, it makes them stronger. So we are expecting a really tough game.’ Outside centre Tevita Kuridrani keeps his place in the Wallaby XV and the 23-year-old’s showdown with George North, filling in for the injured Jonathan Davies, will be one of the most significant head-to-heads. Gatland has complete faith in North’s ability, even suggesting a longer-term move for the Northampton wing. ‘There are a lot of class players who started on the wing and moved to the centre,’ said Gatland. ‘There are two prime examples in Tana Umaga and Ma’a Nonu. So it’s an option for us (to make North’s long-term position centre). But it’s one position we feel we’ve got a bit of strength in depth in.’","Wales have lost last 20 Test against the southern hemisphere’s ‘big three’ of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa .

"Members of the coaching staff at a New Jersey high school where numerous players on the football team were sexually assaulted by other players have been suspended. The Sayreville Board of Education voted to suspend head coach George Najjar and four assistants, Edward Mish, Michael Novak, Mark Poore and Timothy Ballard, with pay on Tuesday evening. School board president Kevin Ciak said that the suspensions were in accordance with policy due to the ongoing investigation and that no decisions had been made about the future employment of the coaches, none of whom has been charged with a crime.

Seven members of the Sayreville War Memorial High School team were charged on October 10 with crimes ranging from hazing to aggravated sexual assault, charges that came to light after the parent of one young boy being hazed by his teammates notified authorities. Their names have not been released because they are under 18. Upperclassmen on the team were said to have held down the younger players on the team in the locker room, anally penetrating them with their fingers and then sticking those fingers in their mouths.

"The Colorado rock slide that killed five hikers on Monday claimed three members of a respected family, along with two cousins who were visiting from Missouri, it was revealed today. Gracie Johnson, 13, was the sole survivor after her father heroically pushed her out of the way of 100 tons of boulders that came loose from the mountain and tumbled onto a hiking trail near Buena Vista, Colorado. Gracie's mother and father Dwayne and Dawna Johnson, ages 46 and 45, were killed, along with her 18-year-old sister Kiowa Raine Johnson and cousins Baigen Walker, 10, and Paris Walkup, 22, from Birch Tree, Missouri. Gracie, who was flown to Children's Hospital of Denver with a broken leg, is one of only two members of her family of five left alive. Tragic: This picture from the Chaffee County Times shows the Johnson family, which was devastated by the rock slide. Daughter Kiowa, 18, (left); mother Dawana, 45, (second from left) and father Dwayne, 47, (right) were killed. Gracie, 13, (second from right) was rescued. Dakota, 20, (seated) was not with the family at the time . Friends said 'everybody' in town knew the family. Dawna and Dwayne once owned a restaurant in town. Dakota was a star football player before he graduated last year . Trapped: Five hikers were killed after being buried under the 100 tons of rock which slid down a mountain in Colorado in September . Gracie, 13, (left) is the only survivor. Her sister Kiowa (right) and mother Dawna (center) died in the land slide . Paris Walkup, 22, was visiting his aunt and uncle in Colorado and died in the rock slide, as well . Her brother Dakota, 20, no longer lives in Buena Vista, but was rushing back to town to be with his sister, the Denver Post reports. Dwayne was an assistant football coach at Buena Vista High School, as well as an electrician and landscaper. Dawn coached track at the high school, was a photographer and a popular waitress at a restaurant in town. 'Everyone knows this family. Everyone who was involved in football knew Dwayne,' Brian Dengler, the pastor at Cornerstone Church, told the Post. 'The whole family, they were gregarious. Very outgoing. Very active in the community. Kiowa just turned 18. Dwayne was so proud of his girl. Just an amazing, amazing family.' On Tuesday, emergency workers returned to the perilous mountainside at Agnes Vaille Falls near Mount Princeton - . 130 miles southwest of Denver. The short mile-and-a-half trail is popular with families and is known as one of the easiest hikes around. The Johnson family took advantage of a clear, beautiful day Monday - following days of rain and clouds previously - to take their visiting family members Baigen and Paris for a hike. Chaffee County Sheriff's Deputy Nick . Tolsma was among the first officials to respond to the scene of the . collapse, where he discovered Gracie alive under a rock. 'I heard a scream next to me. I saw a hand sticking out underneath the boulder,' Tolsma told ABC News. 'The . true hero is her dad. She said her dad jumped on her to protect her at . the last moment when the rocks were coming down. I think he saved her . life.' Geologists believe that the downpour of rain that the area received recently, combined with the onset of frost - which froze and thawed the ground, likely caused the massive rock slide - which loosened boulders the size of cars and let loose an estimate 100 tons of rubble. Rescuers: One 13-year-old girl was flown to a hospital after being pulled from the rubble. Her condition is not known . Sheriff Pete Palmer called off the recovery operation Monday night because the area is too unstable and experts fear another rock slide. 'They are in bad shape. They were rolled over by boulders as big as these cars,' Palmer told reporters. 'There is no one alive up there.' Sheriff's department spokeswoman Monica . Broaddus said rescuers left the mountain before dark Monday. She said . the recovery effort would wait until likely Tuesday afternoon, after an . engineer could survey the slide area to make sure it's safe to remove . the bodies. The sheriff confirmed that Gracie Johnson was hiking with her family. The . disaster happened about 11am. Rescuers were forced to retreat shortly . after the rock slide, over fears that even more boulders could come . crashing down the mountainside. First responders: Chaffee County Sheriff's Deputy Kevin Everson, right, and other deputies walk out the Agnes Vaille Falls trail shortly after leaving the scene of a rock slide that killed five members of the same family . Rapid response: Chaffee County emergency agencies set up a command center at Chimney Rock road, off of CR 162 while they respond to the rock slide at Agnes Vaille Falls . Gracie (left) is seen with brother Dakota (center) and sister Kiowa. Authorities have not confirmed the names of the victims . Loose rocks: The area around the popular hiking trail had received heavy rains recently, which could have caused the devastating rock slide . Backed up: Police closed the road around the hiking trail, causing traffic to pile up in the rural part of Colorado . Large amounts of rain had previously fallen on Mount Princeton, which could have contributed to the boulders coming loose and sliding down the mountain. The trail is popular with day hikers because it offers just a short, rocky scramble to the spectacular Agnes Vaille Falls. The trail is below Mount Princeton, a 14,197-foot peak. The National Forest Service describes the trail as short and relatively easy. The trail is one of the first hikes recommended to people new to the area and is also popular with tourists, said Margaret Dean, a regular hiker who has hiked the trail with her 7-year-old grandson.","Five hikers buried and then declared dead Monday morning on popular hiking trail .

"Russell Brand was held to task by mothers up and down the country this afternoon, after taking part in a Mumsnet webchat. The comic was propositioned several times from members of the parenting website, with some of the women even offering to run away with him. The conversation covered everything from custard creams and spray tans to feminism and the problem with the voting system. But he was also hung out to dry for his previous treatment of women, including using prostitutes. Russell was propositioned several times by members of the website.  He also discussed the merits of biscuits like penguins and custard creams. But the star was also criticised for his treatment of women, including prostitutes . At one point Russell did appear to be confused by the types of conversations he appeared to be having. When one user asked what he had imagined Mumsnet to be like, he responded: 'I thought there'd be a lot more mums and people with prams and more breastfeeding.' Several of the women posting questions made their affections for the star very clear, one said: 'I'm totally up for it btw,' while another wrote: 'Thank you for regularly popping up in my dreams ;-) #mumsnetfilthbench.' One lady went as far as to openly ask Russell about whether he was attracted to older women. The user Grey Gardens wrote: 'Do you have a soft spot for dark-haired, sultry, older women who also support West Ham?' Russell replied: 'Yes –very much. I'm forever blowing bubbles, West Ham forever. Let's run away from all this.' The 39-year-old also tackled some of his biggest gripes about the current ruling party, but not before disclosing his feelings on the perfect biscuit. Despite his constant speeches against what he calls the country's elite, Russell (pictured here at Occupy Wall Street) admitted that he was in two minds about whether the monarchy should be abolished . When asked what his favourite biccie was, he said: 'I know this a sensitive issue - I would say Penguins and Wagon Wheels, although some would say they are not biscuits as they are individually-packaged. 'I also quite like a Custard Creams. 'I am against Rich Teas - you might as well eat a communion wafer.' On a more serious note, Russell Brand claimed that David Cameron and the fellow members of his Conservative government were stunted from their privileged childhoods, which saw many educated in private boarding schools. Russell was on he site top promote his new book Revolution . He said: 'I think that's really significant and an overlooked aspect of it. 'We are being governed by people who have been brought up in compassion-less paddocks and inculcated in solipsism.' Russell, who has been on the promo trail with his new book Revolution in recent weeks, went on to claim that there was more of a point in voting in television talent shows like the X Factor than in a local or general election. He said: 'When we vote for One Direction or Chery Cole, it makes a difference - if you vote for David Cameron, it doesn't.' But despite his constant speeches against what he calls the country's elite, Russell admitted that he was in two minds about whether the monarchy should be abolished. When asked if we needed the royal family, he said: 'No... I'm conflicted. Because I love the pageantry, the outfits, the ceremony. But I know in my heart that it's a symbol of elitism and the hierarchy - how could it be anything else.' Russell also used the conversation to express regret at some of his past behaviour towards women. In his earlier years of fame, he would often sleep with a different girl every night and once bragged of  having sex with nine girls in one evening. He has also spoken openly of using sex workers during his teenage years and went into detail about one experience with a Filipino prostitute during a television show earlier this year. The women on the site attacked him often for his past use of working girls and many claimed that he was a misogynist. He replied: 'I hope I was never a misogynist. 'Complicated, being a man: primal drives, compassion, spiritual awakening, need for status - a tangled, knotted mess of threads, when unraveled all lead to..... not misogyny I hope. Russell also used the conversation on the parenting website to express regret at some of his past behaviour towards women. The comic has admitted to using prostitutes when he was younger - before he met his ex-wife Katy Perry . 'Sometimes, I said things that were a bit sexist, I think it's the same way my nan was a bit racist, she was a product of her time and environment, her natural compassion rebuffed and redirected by the culture of Dagenham. 'With reflection, and contemplation, we all arrive at a place of non-judgement. 'In the past I have done things that are regrettable. 'I was a heroin addict, a criminal, selfish, egotistical. 'Obviously, I'm still not perfect, I'm travelling in the right direction. 'If we preclude the possibility for change and improvement, then who among us isn't f****d?' As well as admitting regret over his past, Russell was also keen to join the likes of Nick Clegg and Ed Milliband in claiming himself a fan of the feminist cause. When asked by one reader if he was a feminist, he said: 'I don't know what the requirements are. I certainly support equal rights regardless of age race and sexual persuasion. 'I also think a good many of the problems we face in society are because of a gender imbalance because women have been unrepresented for centuries.' Since returning from Hollywood, Russell Brand has been getting increasingly involved in politics. Here he is alongside Tessa Jowell and Boris Johnson on an episode of Question Time . As well as promoting his new book Revolution, Russell also  revealed that he would be concentrating much of his literary efforts on extending his range of children's books. He said: 'I started writing for children because I think fairy stories are important moral and ethical codes and I think a lot of the problems we face now are because we're trying to live without a map - we've lost touch with religion and spirituality. 'And by talking directly to children, there's a possibility of communicating directly with the thing in all of us that understands what it is to be good, and aligned and compassionate, before we get muddled up by adulthood. 'I am planning on writing some more children's books, including Rumpelstiltskin.' Despite his regular speeches on the wicked elite and appearance at anti-capitalism protests here in the UK, Russell does maintain that there are several aspects of the country that he is still proud of. When asked what he loves about Britain, he said: 'Everything. 'Loads of things: our sense of humour, our language, our football teams, our sense of fairness and justice and our willingness to embrace new cultures.' The star had a slightly shorter list when asked what he missed about his birth county of Essex, he said: 'The people. And the spray tans.'","Russell was propositioned several times by members of the website .

The Official Guest of Honour will take in a West End musical with 'Bang Bang' singer Jessie J . It seems only fitting that one lucky tourist will be able to enjoy afternoon tea with Downton Abbey's Carson (actor Jim Carter) at Lord's Cricket ground .

"Search and rescue officials are searching for two hikers after rescuing two others in a remote corner of Washington after waist deep snow left them trapped in the wilderness. Alejandra Wilson was reported missing on the rugged Pacific Crest Trail Monday, while separate hiker Kristopher Zitzewitz was last seen in the Big Lava Beds area of Gifford Pinchot National Forest. Both are in the southwest of the state. Matt Margiotta and Kyla Arnold were hoisted aboard a Coast Guard helicopter Tuesday evening  after being plucked from waist-deep snow north of Trout Lake, Washington and were transported to Portland, Oregon. They required no medical aid, said Skamania County Undersheriff Dave Cox. Scroll down for video... Missing: Hikers Kristopher Zitzewitz (left) and Alejandra Wilson went missing Monday from a remote corner of southwest Washington State . Rescued: Kyla Arnold and Matt Margiotta were rescued Tuesday after calling for help on Monday from the rugged Pacific Crest Trail in southwest Washington. The duo had gotten there all the way from Mexico, hoping to make it to Canada . They had walked all the way from Mexico on the trail only to run into early season snowfall in their attempt to reach the Canadian border. They called for help Monday after snow obscured their route. Ground searchers who had the pair’s GPS location got within three-quarters of a mile on Tuesday before the snow and fading daylight forced them to turn back. The helicopter from Astoria, Oregon, took advantage of a weather window to reach them. Wilson was reported overdue on Monday after she failed to check in with her father, Dane Wilson, of Portland, Oregon, as expected. She was believed to be about a day’s hike ahead of Margiotta and Arnold’s location, or about 20 miles farther north. 'We’ll keep trying to ping her phone, get a location on her,' Cox said, adding he hoped the weather would allow an air search. According to his blog, Zitzewitz had proudly lost some 300 pounds in recent years. The hiker was lost separately from the others, in an area of Gifford Pinchot National Forest . Safe: Margiotta was plucked from a trail near Trout Lake, Washington Tuesday evening after he and Kyla Arnold were trapped in a snow storm. They were uninjured and taken to Portland, Oregon . Sighting: Arnold (pictured), Margiotta, and Wilson all kept online hiking journals. Arnold's noted her seeing Wilson not long before a snowstorm trapped them all . Her father reported that he last . heard from her Friday as she was leaving Trout Lake, a tiny hamlet south . of Mount Adams, for White Pass, Cox said. More . than 40 ground searchers and four dog teams searched Tuesday for . Zitzewitz, 31, of Portland, who became separated from his partner in the . Big Lava Beds on Saturday. Cox . said his office requested that many ground searchers again for . Wednesday, as well as ATVs, 4-wheeled vehicles, and air support. Weather in that area was rainy, with temperatures dipping into the low 40s at night, he said. Margiotta, Arnold and Wilson all kept . online journals of their travels. Arnold last updated hers on Friday . and described having recently encountered Wilson, who has gone by the . name Rocket Llama. Wilson wrote of her excitement for hiking the trail in her journal titled Pacific Crest Trail 2013. 'PCT, . here I come! My name's Alejandra, and I'm going to thru-hike the . Pacific Crest Trail in 2013. It's my very first independently-planned . trip and long-distance hike and I'm SO EXCITED!' The young hiker wrote a foreboding message in her journal's bio page: 'I have promised to keep updating from the trail so the folks back home know I'm still alive.' Wilson's last entry was from home in Portland, Oregon on September 22. In deep: Margiotta and Arnold spent two days under this tarp after feet of snow fell in just around 18 hours . Arnold . also wrote of having nearly run out of food after storms forced her and . Margiotta to huddle under a tarp for four days — long delaying their . arrival in Trout Lake. 'We finally made it to Trout Lake today and another huge storm is rolling in,' Arnold wrote. 'Everyone says we can’t make it because of the weather situation, and . to be honest it’s quite terrifying, but I can’t fathom coming this far . and giving up.' Margiotta took to Facebook to relay his tale following the rescue. Missing: A view from the Pacific Crest Trail shows the area's ruggedness. Waist deep snow stranded hikers Matt Margiotta, Kyla Arnold, and Alejandra Wilson on Monday. Wilson is still missing . Separately: 31-year-old Kristopher Zitzewitz was last seen separately in the Big Lava Beds area of Washington's Gifford Pinchot National Forest. He remained missing Wednesday morning . 'My hiking partner and I were caught in a blizzard,' he wrote. Believe it or not dehydration was our biggest concern. After spending 2 days trapped in a tarp and realizing trying to hike out was a death sentence...we were forced to call 911.' The duo made the call fearing dehydration. But rescuers on the ground were eventually forced to call 911 themselves, he says. 'We are now safe and sound in Portland after being airlifted out by Coast Guard.' he wrote. Snow has been falling in the Washington mountains since the weekend, which was likely the first snow to fall on Pacific Crest Trail hikers, Cox said. Searchers encountered two other hikers on the trail and persuaded them to turn around. ‘The problem with all the snow on the ground is you can’t even tell where the trail is,’ Cox said. ‘Some folks try to push on and wind up getting lost.’ The Pacific Crest Trail runs 2,650 miles from Mexico to the Canadian border.","Matt Margiotta and Kyla Arnold were rescued by helicopter Tuesday evening after calling for help on the Pacific Crest Trail near Trout Lake, Washington .

"A runaway teenager who had been missing for a month contacted his parents this week to come and get him. Christian Roe, 15, of Auburn, Michigan, called his parents from Jacksonville, Florida, over 1,000 miles from where he lives, telling them he wanted to come home. The young girl who ran away with him, 14-year-old Olivia Kean, is still missing. Found: Christian Roe (above) a 15-year-old boy who ran away a month ago was found in Florida this week . Still missing: It is still not known where the 14-year-old girl who ran away with Christian, Olivia Kean (above), is at this time . Video Source WJRT . Christian first made contact with his father around 10pm on Tuesday. 'He said he was safe, that he'd hurt his ankle, and that he was no longer with Olivia,' his mother, Kari Roe-LaFramboise, told Michigan Live. 'He borrowed some lady's phone on the road so he could call and say he wanted to come home.' Immediately, Christian's mother, her husband and Christian's father, Jay Roe, got in a car and began the long drive to Florida. The three plan on meeting Christian at a Jacksonville bank on Thursday. For his mother, it will be the end of a long and harrowing ordeal. 'No words are able to describe how horrible it's been,' she said. 'To go from not being able to eat, breathe, or sleep, to being so sick over what could be happening, to being so mad you want to scream.' Authorities are hoping that once Christian is back with his parents he will be able to tell them where they can find Olivia. The two were last seen on October 15, and likely drove off in a 2002 Dodge Ram pickup truck that belongs to Olivia's family. Neither of the teens are old enough to drive, and it is still uncertain how they were able to provide for themselves with no help for this long. Emergency"" Olivia's mother, Kari Kean, says her daughter has a medical condition that requires constant attention . Planned: Olivia took her family's pickup truck and packed some belongings before leaving, also taking with her her black Chihuahua, Salsa (right) Now Olivia's mother, Katrina Kean, is making an open plea to her daughter in hopes that she will return. 'We can get through this together,' said the bereaved mother on Tuesday. 'Some times, things seem worse than the they really are. Even less will happen if she decides on her own to come home. The whole town will celebrate your coming home safely and we all will finally breathe a sigh of relief.' Katrina has also mentioned on a Facebook page she started in hopes of locating her daughter that the young girl has a serious medical condition that requires attention. It would seem that Christian did not plan to runaway as he left with just the clothes he was wearing, while Olivia did pack some of her possessions. She also brought along her black Chihuahua, Salsa. It is still not known what motivated the two to drive over 1,000 miles and leave their families.","Christian Roe, a 15-year-old who ran away from his home in Auburn, Michigan, on October 15 has been found .

"A window into Boston's past has turned up in an unusual place: the head of a lion's statue on the building that once served as the seat of Massachusetts government. The Bostonian Society said Tuesday it had confirmed the presence of what had long been rumored to be a time capsule from 1901 tucked away inside the copper statue. The statue was recently taken down from the roof as part of a restoration effort. Window to the past: The golden lion at left was placed atop Boston's Old State House near the turn of the 20th century and has now been revealed to contain a time capsule from 1901 . Generations later: A woman purporting to be the descendant of the statues' sculptor claimed years ago that she knew for sure the lion contained a time capsule . A fiber optic camera was used to locate the time capsule - in actuality a copper box - in the head of the lion, according to Heather Leet, the society's director of development. The next steps, she said, will include an attempt to carefully open the statue without damaging it, followed by the removal of the box and examination of its contents. The group first learned of the potential existence of the time capsule several years ago from a woman who was a descendent of the original sculptor. 'She had a letter from him and a list of things in the time capsule,' said Leet. The society did some further research and uncovered a 1901 article about the time capsule in The Boston Globe, she said. Newspaper clippings and photographs from the period, along with letters from politicians and other prominent Bostonians of the era, are among the items expected to be found in the box, which could be opened as early as next week. Bostonians have whispered about the existence of a time capsule inside the head of the lion statue placed atop the city's Old State House for years. The rumors began when a woman purporting to be the descendant of the statue's sculptor came forward, but the denizens of the Massachusetts town have had to wait until now to know for sure. A 1901 article in the Boston Globe reported on the original placement of the statue, as well as the box inside that has nbw been found: . The work of the coppersmith is completed, and one of the last things he did was to seal a copper box, which is placed in the head of the lion, and which contains contributions from state and city officials, the Boston daily newspapers, the name of the maker of the lion and unicorn, and others, which will prove interesting when the box is opened many years hence.B . Source: Boston.com . Replaced wooden version: The copper lion and unicorn atop the building today replaced older wooden versions seen here in a lithograph that shows the reading of the Declaration of Independence . 'We're really looking forward to seeing what those letters say,' said Leet, adding that they could contain messages written to future generations. The Old State House, among Boston's most popular tourist attractions, has a storied history. It was one of the city's most important civic buildings in colonial times and later became a focal point of the American Revolution. The Boston Massacre took place just outside the building in 1770. In 1776, the Declaration of Independence was read to Bostonians from the balcony. After the war of independence, the building served as the first seat of Massachusetts government until construction of the current Statehouse in the late 18th century. The first lion statue, along with that of a unicorn, was placed on the building in 1713 as symbols to mark the unification of England and Scotland, Leet said. The statues were destroyed amid the subsequent patriotic fervor, but were replaced more than a century later by the society as part of an effort to preserve the building and restore its historical look. Rich history: The Boston Massacre took place just outside the building in 1770. In 1776, the Declaration of Independence was read to Bostonians from the balcony.

"The soft drinks and snacks were laid out, the music set to a sensible level and, more importantly, Mum was on hand to police proceedings. But Sarah Hine’s early 15th birthday party soon spiralled out of control  after word spread on Facebook and Twitter, attracting a crowd of about 800 teenagers by one estimate. Over the next couple of hours – before police arrived and called time – the  youngsters left an extraordinary trail of destruction that will cost up to £30,000 to put right. Drunk teenagers smashed holes in the ceiling, drew on walls and ripped doors off their hinges as around 800 youngsters descended on the Essex home . The party was thrown by Sarah Hine, 14, but got out of control despite her mother, Esther, 56, being there to try and keep order . One neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: ‘It was like Belfast in the 1970s out there. It was terrifying. There were hundreds of people out to cause trouble’ Discord: A piano was smashed up in the front garden before police dispersed the rowdy youngsters . Horde: Crowds of people outside the home. They were made aware of the party through social media sites . Witnesses at the party claimed teenagers had broken into the loft and were bouncing on ceiling insulation before one fell through into the bedroom . Offensive graffiti was scrawled on walls, doors were torn from their hinges and shelves were pulled down with their contents scattered around. The ceiling was left with a gaping hole after a group of teenagers got into the loft and leapt around on the insulation before one fell through. Rumours on Twitter suggested a hedgehog was flushed down a toilet and someone defecated on a bed. Another report suggested a grand piano had been thrown into the garden from the £305,000 five-bedroom semi-detached home in Billericay, Essex. Sarah’s family denied this yesterday, saying it was an upright piano that had been in the garden at the start of the party but was destroyed by revellers. But one uncontested fact is that the 14-year-old’s mother, Esther, 56, is now counting the cost following the sickening realisation their insurers will not pay for repairs as the revellers were invited into her home. ‘I am stunned. Why would they do this?’ said local church leader Mrs Hine, whose desperate pleas to party-goers were ignored as she tried to maintain control. ‘There must be £20,000 to £30,000 damage but insurance won’t pay out because we invited them in. ‘I told the parents I would be here to keep an eye out for trouble. There wasn’t supposed to be drink but the police told me they confiscated an unbelievable amount of alcohol from the groups.’ Aftermath: Discarded alcohol lies strewn around the room among smashed and upended furniture . Debris: Homeowner Esther Hine knew the party had been advertised on Facebook two weeks ago . Venue: The Billericay house where the party was held. The damage caused by the party is estimated to be up to £30,000 . Wrecked: These cupboards were smashed open and ripped apart as drunk teens stormed the house . Mrs Hine admitted she had ignored warnings two weeks ago from her daughter’s school that trouble was expected. Staff at Anglo European School in Ingatestone – rated one of the best state schools in the country – warned against the open invitation that had been posted on Facebook. But the mother of two, who is married to computer consultancy owner Andrew, 60, and has a second daughter, Rachel, 19, said: ‘I just didn’t think this would happen. I knew Sarah knew some people but did not expect that many to turn up.’ The party, ahead of Sarah’s 15th in February, began at 7pm on Friday and the chaos started within minutes, with people spilling out on to the road outside. One neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: ‘It was like Belfast in the 1970s out there. It was terrifying. There were hundreds of people out to cause trouble.’ Another said: ‘It was absolute carnage as there were children pouring out of the house. ‘I would have said there was about 800 of them when the police turned up at around 8.30pm. They were trying to escape up the road, not realising it was a cul-de-sac.’ Sarah Hine’s name was even ‘trending’ on Twitter at one stage due to the number of photographs being tweeted by revellers. Essex Police said no one was injured at the party – the party-goer who fell through the ceiling appears to have had a lucky escape as a  double bed was immediately below. A spokesman said: ‘Police were called after calls from residents regarding nuisance behaviour in the street. Officers found a large number of teenagers had visited the area to attend a party advertised openly on social media. ‘No arrests were made and no complaints were made regarding criminal damage.’ Invite: The party's host Sarah Hines posting about the party on Facebook .

"Lewis Hamilton was left with a protocol dilemma after cruising to the 31st victory of his career: how do you behave in front of the president of the Russian Federation? He turned against the wall in the pre-podium room and fluffed his hair, as has become his custom in recent months. The question was immediately raised whether this was a calculated slight motivated by a political objection. Doubtful. When Hamilton realised that Putin was in attendance, he shook the hand of the inscrutable leader, a ritual the pair repeated when Putin handed over the winner’s trophy for the inaugural Russian Grand Prix.

Sauber/Caterham 0 . It was a processional bore of a race from the moment Nico Rosberg overcooked his move on Hamilton, the pole-sitter, on the first lap and went in for a change of tyres to cure the vibration caused by locking up. But it was still an astonishing afternoon in this Black Sea resort. An edict was sent out by Bernie Ecclestone calling for the Russian national anthem to be heard in stillness and silence. So he and the Russian deputy prime minister Dmitry Kozak stood side by side with the drivers at the front of the grid as the 80-strong Kuban Cossack Chorus intoned the august hymn to the Motherland. It was an amazing, and bizarrely moving, scene: this corporate sport of the West being trumpeted in the heartland of the old Eastern Bloc.

The Russian Grand Prix was 30 years in the making and Lewish Hamilton became its first winner . For Ecclestone it was a dream come true, 30 years after Leonid Brezhnev first mooted the idea of staging a race around the Kremlin. But at this point there was no Putin, the anticipated grid walk off the schedule, possibly for security reasons. His arrival, was now scheduled for mid-race. So with 39 laps gone, he was met at the circuit gates by Ecclestone, who usually flies home before the race ends. The two men, each in white shirt sleeves, are old friends. Putin invited Ecclestone to the Olympics staged in this very place earlier this year, but he could not go. But there was no chance that Putin would stay away from this. His country spent £30billion-plus on creating an Olympic town out of nothing, and the grand prix is an associated project to show his people and the world what Russia can accomplish under his aegis.

Mercedes drivers Rosberg (left) leads Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen into the corner on the circuit in Soch . Putin and Ecclestone along with the King of Bahrain, who was in town for talks with the president, went up to the VIP stand to watch the closing moments of the soporific action. Putin barely speaks English but, as Ecclestone said afterwards, the two of them understand each other perfectly. Four times the cameras cut away from the racing to show Putin in the stands. Accompanied by Ecclestone, he then went into the podium drivers’ room. He asked in Russian, which was translated into English: ‘How much weight do you lose in a race?’ ‘He didn’t say anything to me,’ said the hirsute Hamilton of the pre-podium meeting. ‘He was talking to those girls behind. Then I realised he was there and came over and shook his hand. ‘It was surreal to meet him. I don’t know too much about him. I know a lot more about Barack (Obama). It was very cool to be presented the trophy by the president. He’s one of the most powerful men in the world.’ Williams driver Valtteri Bottas passes the 2014 Winter Olympic stadium during the first Russian Grand Prix . Ferrari's Fernando Alonso (left) chases Button during the inaugural Russian Grand Prix in Sochi . Hamilton was in control from the moment that Rosberg made a mistake on the very first lap . Was Putin presenting the prizes particularly unusual? No, heads of state often do so if they are attending a race. For example, the blazer-wearing Prince Albert performs the duty in Monaco every year. What was different was the secrecy surrounding Putin’s movements to the extent that the PA announcer was handed a piece of paper that omitted to name Putin as the prize-giver. For Hamilton, the race was won within moments of it beginning. Rosberg, who started second, pulled fractionally ahead of him on the first lap but ran wide, his tyres smoking as he did so. The British driver has extended his lead over Rosberg at the top of the World Championship to 17 points . Rosberg was able to complete 52 laps on a single set of tires, but his early mistake cost him dearly . Red Bull's Vettel has slipped to fifth in the drivers championship after finishing a disappointing eighth . He went in for a change of tyres, using his new pair for the 52 remaining laps of the 53-lap race. The asphalt was as smooth silk. Such is the superiority of the Mercedes that Rosberg sliced through from the back to finish second. Valtteri Bottas, of a resurgent Williams, added to his burgeoning reputation by coming third. He is a good little racer. Russian President Vladimir Putin (left) talk to Bernie Ecclestone (right) during the Grand Prix in Russia . Russian President Vladimir Putin (left) welcomes the King of Bahrain, Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, to Sochi . Hamilton’s win takes his career tally level with Nigel Mansell. A 32nd win will make him outright the most prolific race winner. Victory extended his lead to 17 points – sadly a near-irrelevance because of the risible double points in the final race in Abu Dhabi. The American and Brazilian races come before the likely title decider in the gleaming extravagance in the desert on November 23. But one championship was settled here: the constructors’ title going to Mercedes. With apologies to Stuttgart, this is a remarkable British feat given that Mercedes are based in Brackley, Northamptonshire. If any one individual deserves praise it is Ross Brawn, the mastermind of their superiority. He was dispensed with in an awful power struggle last year and now spends more time with his family and his fishing rod.

"Harvard has set up a task force to evaluate its sexual assault policy after a student penned a scathing op-ed about the Ivy League university's indifference to her alleged attack. The student, who wrote the letter anonymously for The Harvard Crimson, said staff discouraged her from pursuing charges against her attacker, meaning she is still living in the same dorm as he is. Following the emotional response to the article, Harvard's Undergraduate Council has set up a task force to discuss the university's sexual assault policy, which the student branded 'outdated'. University officials sent a letter to undergraduates saying they will support the group, ABC reported. A Harvard student has written a damning open letter attacking the University's indifference to an alleged sexual assault from another student . 'Harvard College as an institution and as . a community deplores sexual violence and is committed to its prevention . and to supporting its victims,' Stephen Lassonde, dean of student . life, wrote in the letter. 'Sexual harassment and sexual assault can never be tolerated. He said that the results of the task force would be shared with the entire community. He added: 'To build a community free of sexual . violence and harassment will require all of us working together. We take this issue very seriously and it is our hope . that no student feels discouraged from reporting an incident.' It comes just days after the student wrote in the letter titled 'Dear Harvard: You win' that the alleged incident happened in a friend's dorm room on a Friday night 'after too many drinks' last year. She said the attacker took her shirt off and started biting her skin. 'I . pushed back on his chest and asked him to stop kissing me aggressively. He laughed. He said that I should 'just wear a scarf' to cover the . marks. He continued to abuse my body. 'I . was intoxicated, I was in pain, I was trapped between him and the wall, . and I was scared to death that he would continue to ignore what I said. Lack of support: The student claims she was . discouraged from seeking charges against her alleged attacker because . her assault did not fit the narrow language of Harvard's student . handbook (file photo) 'I stopped everything and turned my back to him, praying he would leave . me alone.' She writes how he started getting impatient and made an explicit demand to which she wrote: 'It did not sound like a question. I obeyed.' The student then writes that she was discouraged from seeking charges against her alleged attacker because her assault did not fit the narrow language of Harvard’s student handbook, written in 1993. 'When I told my House Master that I was considering an Ad Board process, I was told it was a bad time of the semester, that there would be consequences for my assailant anyway, and that we shouldn’t go through the process if it was going to be fruitless,' she wrote. 'Shortly after, my resident dean told me that my assailant couldn’t be punished because he didn’t know what he was doing. The resident dean compared living in the same House as my assailant to a divorced couple working in the same factory.' She explains that although she was offered the chance to move to another House early on she declined because 'transferring felt utterly disempowering. Moving to a different House would have felt like giving up and granting even more power to my assailant.' She said she is now on anti-depressants and is now falling behind on her school work because she finds it difficult seeing her alleged attacker up to five times a day . 'I spend most of my time outside of class curled up in bed, crying, sleeping, or staring at the ceiling, occasionally wondering if I just heard my assailant’s voice in the staircase.' She added: 'I will be moving out of my House next semester, if only - quite literally - to save my life.' According to the Centers for Disease Control, 19 percent of undergraduate women experience attempted or completed sexual assault since starting college. According to AAUW 42 per cent of college women who are raped tell no one about the assault.","Anonymous student wrote the letter entitled 'Dear Harvard: You Win' on The Harvard Crimson's website at the weekend .

"Taxpayers paid £1million to a suspected terrorist accused of going to al-Qaeda training camps and planning attacks on American and Jewish targets. Feroz Abbasi was one of 16 men held at Guantanamo Bay who were paid a total of £20million compensation by the UK to settle claims of complicity in their rendition and detention. U.S. forces captured the 34-year-old from Croydon, South London, in Afghanistan and held him in a series of secret prisons until finally releasing him from Guantanamo in 2005. Compensated: Feroz Abbasi, who was paid around £1million by the UK government to settle a lawsuit over its complicity in his extraordinary rendition and detention in Guantanamo Bay after his arrest in Afghanistan . It has now emerged that an al-Qaeda 'supergrass' told officials in 2004 that Abbasi had been helped travel to Afghanistan by extremist cleric Abu Hamza 'to receive jihad training'. The revelations, contained in documents relating to Hamza's trial in the U.S., have prompted questions over the decision to pay compensation to Abbasi when there were claims he was at the heart of an Islamic terrorist group. Robin Simcox, an al-Qaeda expert at the Henry Jackson Society, a hawkish neoliberal thinktank, told the Sunday Telegraph he found Abbasi's pay-off 'troubling'. 'The Government agreed a settlement with the Guantánamo detainees because it believed it was better than a lengthy litigation process in which secret intelligence would be exposed and national security could be seriously damaged,' said Mr Simcox. 'However, there was never an admittance of liability that the security services had done anything wrong. In Feroz Abbasi’s case, the facts have always pointed towards his involvement with dangerous, extremist causes, which makes his payout all the more troubling.' Detainees at Guantanamo: An alleged confession could not be used as evidence after claims that Abbasi was tortured while in U.S. custody . A British citizen who moved to South London from Uganda when he was just eight, Abbasi was brought up a moderate Muslim but gradually became more fervent and began attending the radical Finsbury Park mosque in 2000. He was arrested in Kunduz, Afghanistan, by Northern Alliance forces in December 2001, at the age of 23, and handed over to U.S. troops, who shipped him to Afghanistan in 2002. Despite repeated claims he would face a U.S. military tribunal, Abbasi was repatriated to Britain just under three years later along with Moazzam Begg, Martin Mubanga and Richard Belmar, and then released when no charges were brought. An alleged handwritten confession could not be used as evidence in British courts after claims that Abbasi was tortured during his time in U.S. custody. He and his fellow detainees went in to sue the UK government for complicity in his illegal rendition and detention by the U.S. and in 2010 a secret deal was reached with both sides signing confidentiality agreements. Part of the settlement was a bumper compensation pay-out for the men, the details of which remain secret and will not be discussed by the Cabinet Office. But new documents prepared by U.S. prosecutors for the trial of Abu Hamza, the firebrand preacher at the Finsbury Park mosque, claim that Abbasi was close to the heart of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. Saajid Badat, an would-be shoe-bomber who turned supergrass in exchange for a shorter sentence, claims he met Abbasi in 2001 in Kandahar. He says he looked after Abbasi in Afghanistan and acted as a translator between him and 'two of al-Qaeda's most senior leaders' who, he claims, asked Abbasi if he would be willing to attack 'American and Jewish targets'. Abu Hamza on trial in New York: The claims, contained in documents relating to Hamza's trial in the U.S., have prompted questions over the decision award the compensation pay out to Abbasi . The U.S. Justice Department says Badat first provided his testimony about Abbasi's role in conspiracies with Abu Hamza in 2004 and that another, unnamed, witness has corrobarated the account. At Hamza's trial in New York, Badat said he saw Abbasi at an al-Qaeda training camp in 2001, but admitted under cross-examination that he only saw him using a spade to dif holes. Hamza denies charges of trying to set up a terrorist training camp in the U.S., of supporting al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and providing assistance to militants who kidnapped 16 Western tourists in Yemen in 1998. He has claimed he was merely a spokesman for terrorist groups 'like Gerry Adams with the IRA.' The trial continues. Since returning to Britain, Abbasi has married and become a father after studying at a London university.","Feroz Abbasi was one of 16 who shared £20million Government pay-out .

On the eve of a make-or-break speech seeking to draw a line under his most turbulent period since beating brother David for the Labour leadership in 2010, he conceded his ‘mettle has been tested’ by ‘a difficult couple of weeks’. With six months until the general election, the IpsosMori survey shows just 13 per cent of people now think he is ready to run the country, with the Tories now three points ahead – the biggest lead for four years. Scroll down for video . Ed Miliband's net satisfaction ratings have slumped 10 points to -44, the worst for any main party leader six months before a general election, according to IpsosMORI data dating back to the 1970s . Only 13 per cent of people think Mr Miliband is ready to be PM, down from 22 per cent when the same question was asked in June . Mr Miliband met journalism students during a visit to Harlow College with Suzy Stride, Labour Parliamentary candidate for Harlow in Essex . Mr Miliband's leadership has been rocked by growing discontent in the Labour party, with 'depressed' MPs and frontbenchers fearing he is leading them to defeat. Just 21 per cent of people are now satisfied with his performance as leader, with an extraordinary 65 per cent dissatisfied, according to the IpsosMORI survey for the Standard. It means his net rating is -44 per cent, down 10 points in month and eight points lower than Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg. Analysis of 40 years of party leaders' ratings six months before general elections shows no leader has ever been more unpopular at this stage of the electoral cycle. Mr Foot, who secured just 28 per cent of the vote against Margaret Thatcher's Tories in 1983, had net satisfaction of -38 per cent at this stage. It means Mr Miliband is now considered less impressive than Gordon Brown, Michael Howard, Neil Kinnock and Jim Callaghan before they all led their parties to defeat. Last night Mr Miliband said: ‘This job is a tough job and it should be a tough job. It’s an audition to be prime minister. ‘They say what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger and that’s true and, you know, my mettle has been tested but people want a prime minister, want a leader of the Labour Party, who can come through tough times and will fight for them and that’s who I am,' he told the BBC. The Labour leader took part in a question and answer session this afternoon, as he prepares to deliver a major speech on Thursday setting out his principles for government . The Conservatives have pulled into a three-point lead, their biggest margin over Labour since 2010 . Just 21 per cent of people are now satisfied with his performance as leader, with an extraordinary 65 per cent dissatisfied, according to the IpsosMORI survey . Ukip leader Nigel Farage hinted he could do a deal with Labour . Ukip could enter coalition with Labour if Ed Miliband falls short of a majority, Nigel Farage has admitted. Polls suggest another hung parliament is increasingly likely. Mr Farage told the New Statesman: 'I'd do a deal with the Devil if he got me what I wanted.' Asked if he would agree to join a coalition with Labour in exchange for an in-out referendum on Britain leaving the EU, he added . 'That would depend when the referendum was, and the terms.' Pressed on whether he was ruling it out, Mr Farage said: 'Of course not.' David Cameron, meanwhile, is on -15 per cent, with 38 per cent satisfied with his performance. Some 32 per cent of people now say they are going to vote for the Conservatives, three points ahead of Labour on 29 per cent – the same level of support secured by Mr Brown in Labour's defeat in 2010. Just 23 per cent of voters think Labour is ready to form the next government, down from 35 per cent in June this year. Almost two thirds (61 per cent) disagreed. Bobby Duffy, Managing Director at Ipsos MORI said: 'The interviewing for this poll was conducted at the height of the very public discussion of a possible challenge to Ed Miliband's leadership of the party – and it looks like it's had a significant effect on public opinion. 'The Labour leadership will clearly hope that this marks a low point - they've lost the lead to the Conservatives in overall voting intention, but they're still within touching distance, despite all the negative coverage.' Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said the polls had been 'bouncing about'. 'We've had polls which have put Labour three and four points ahead,' he told BBC News. 'The only poll which matters is the general election day. Of course that's a cliche, but it's true. 'Our party is determined - from Ed Miliband, right down, throughout all our shadow cabinet and MPs - to get out there and say we'll have reform in Europe but we won't play fast and loose with jobs and investment like David Cameron, we'll have tough and fair immigration controls but we won't walk away from international markets like Ukip and the Tories, that we will have action on banking reform but also a bank bonus tax. 'We've got the policies. I think with Ed Miliband's leadership we can persuade the British people in the coming months that we've got the plan to make our economy strong and secure for the future. That's what we've got to do and that's what we'll do every day until polling day.' Sunday's newspapers were dominated by headlines about concern at the highest levels of the Labour party that Mr Miliband's poor personal ratings could cost the party victory next year. Tony Blair yesterday insisted it was not his job to save the Labour party as he gave lukewarm support to Ed Miliband's beleaguered leadership. The former prime minister was repeatedly pressed on live TV about the crisis in the Labour party, insisting it was 'not a topic for me' and only eventually conceding Mr Miliband has his 'full support'. And after Mr Miliband's week of dire headlines and warnings many want him to quit, Mr Blair told him bluntly: 'That's what leadership is about.' David Cameron has opened up the biggest Tory lead in the polls since October 2010, with his net satisfaction ratings at -15 . Tomorrow Mr Miliband is expected to give a make or break speech to shore up his troubled leadership. Addressing Labour activists in central London, he is expected to set out his the principles he would take into Downing Street. The theme of the speech could be summed up as 'here I stand', an aide told the Telegraph. He will promise that he will will not 'leave decency at the door of Downing Street'. But while many Labour MPs insist they do not doubt his principles, they are despairing about his dire personal ratings and fear it is costing them support - and seats. Alan Johnson this week explicitly ruled out replacing Mr Miliband as Labour leader, saying he would 'never' take the job. The popular former home secretary threw Mr Miliband a lifeline by warning rebel MPs that he will not step in if the beleaguered leader is ousted. It comes after claims up to one in five of Mr Miliband's frontbenchers was ready to call on him to go, with Mr Johnson favourite as a caretaker leader.","IpsosMORI survey: Tories on 32%, Labour 29%, Ukip 14%, Lib Dems 9% .

"A scaffold malfunction left two window washers dangling 69 stories high over New York City on Wednesday afternoon. The incident occurred at One World Trade Center, the tallest building in the Western hemisphere at a staggering 1,776 feet. The Fire Department of New York City rushed to the building after a 911 call was placed by someone inside when the scaffold broke sometime around 12:45pm. Scroll down for videos . Dangling: The scaffold malfunction occurred 69 stories high at One World Trade Center at around 12:45pm Wednesday afternoon . Rescue: The FDNY shared this photo from inside the building as they decided on the best method to safely get the washers inside . Terrifying height: The collapsed scaffold can be seen from blocks away, and crowds gathered near the building to take photos . Safe and sound: One of the workers is pulled in from the scaffolding by a member of the fire department . The rescued men were identified as Juan Lopez, who has been a window washer for five years, and Juan Lizama, who has been on the job for 14 years. In the end, FDNY broke a window on the 68th floor to get the two men that were trapped off the scaffold and safe inside the building, this after 90 minutes dangling from the broken rig. The workers were going up the building when one of the motorized cables supporting the scaffold snapped or came loose. The two looked remarkably composed in photographs taken just seconds after they were back inside the building, and neither appears to have been injured. They were both taken to Bellevue Hospital with mild hypothermia said Patrick Foye, executive director of the Port Authority. All good: A look at the second worker as he gets safely in the building after being trapped for 90 minutes . Getting them safe: The FDNY was considering multiple plans on how to get the workers to safety . All hands: A look at members of FDNY on top of the building, where at one point they discussed having a firefighter repel down . The two workers, who work for a company called Upgrade Services that contracts out to the Port Authority, were trapped on the south side of the building, and both were tethered. On the Upgrade Services website, One World Trade is prominently displayed on the homepage as a featured client. A representative for the company declined to comment. Window washers have been seen on the building the past few days getting the building ready now that construction is complete. 'This is a case where our first responders (were) working in tandem to have not one escape route, but two, to make sure these individuals would be safe,' said New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio. 'Thank God, Plan A, which was the Fire Department’s approach to get them out through the window…has succeeded and both of them are safe.' He also added there will be an investigation into what went wrong. Getting a look: Workers on the site looked to see what was happening as the workers dangle 69 stories up . Clearing the area: Police and security ushered guests away from the building as the FDNY prepared to break the glass windows . Grabbing a pic: Bystanders snapped photos of the trapped men and some took video which made its way to social media . One World Trade, which stands where the Twin Towers used to be located in Manhattan, has only recently opened, with new tenants including magazine giant Conde Nast just starting to move in this week. The State of New York and Port Authority also have offices in the building. Tense moments: A crowd of people look on before the NYPD began clearing some people out of the area . On the scene: A New York City police officer stands guard outside the building, where two streets were briefly shut down . First to arrive: The Fire Department says they responded to a call shortly before 1pm on Wednesday . Inside view: Just Tuesday Vogue editor Hamish Bowles shared a photo of a window washer getting to work outside Anna Wintour's office at One World Trade . One World Trade is 104 stories high and is owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

"As she approached her 60th birthday, there was only one present Linda Briggs wanted - new breasts. The 59-year-old from Norfolk was determined to wear a backless, silk dress as she celebrated her milestone birthday, and all that stood in her way was her 'saggy' cleavage. So rather than consign the dress to her wardrobe, Linda instead booked to have a boob job in Paris. Forking out to look younger: Linda Briggs has spent more than £50,000 to roll back the years . Transformed: Linda, left, aged 44 when she was mistaken for her sister's mother, and right, after more than 50 procedures including a boob job . It's not the first time she's been under the knife. In fact she's had more than 50 procedures in the past 15 years, spending over £50,000 in the process. She said: 'I don't want to look old and I will do whatever is necessary to stop the process.' As a result of her quest to roll back the years, she has had procedures including upper and lower eye lid reduction, a face lift, a neck lift, eye bag removal, liposuction on her stomach and thighs and even had her toe straightened. The former lawyer reveals on Channel 5 documentary '200 Nips & Tucks and I Want More!' that cosmetic surgery has become the 'norm' for her. She said: 'I wouldn't say I'm addicted to surgery but if I have an issue I will have it corrected.' She added: 'I know what can be achieved with cosmetic surgery so I am less tolerant of any problems that I have. If it's easy to go and do it, I'll go and do it and get rid of it.' Linda revealed that her obsession with surgery began aged 44 when she was mistaken for her younger sister's mother at her wedding. Quick fix: Linda says she's not addicted to surgery but is happy to go under the knife if necessary when she spots something she wants to change . She explains: 'A friend of hers came up to me and asked if I was her mother. I didn't react at the time although I wanted to kill her! It was like a stab in the back, I was shocked I never thought I looked that old. 'I got back and looked in the mirror and thought ""why would she think I'm my sister's mother?"" 'I studied my face and thought ""you've got a turkey neck and lines like the grand canyon"". I screamed and cried, then thought ""now's the time for a face lift"".' Since then she has had dozens of procedures to help her look younger and slimmer. She said she isn't worried about an operation going disastrously wrong and doesn't think she will even look unnatural as a result of playing with nature. Uplifting: The former lawyer went to Paris to have a boob job ahead of her 60th birthday . Ta dah! Linda back in her favourite dress which she couldn't wear when she had 'saggy' boobs . She said: 'I don't think you can tell I have had surgery as I do try and keep it as natural as possible. I will never grow old gracefully. I will grow old as disgracefully as I possibly can.' She added: 'I am blasé about it. Once I have made the decision I am going it, I do research right surgery and surgeon.' Most recently she had a breast lift so she could have the cleavage of a woman half her age on her 60th birthday. She was delighted with the result which she showed off in her favourite black dress. 'I haven't worn this for years as my breasts have been saggy and you can't wear it with a bra, now it looks great. All of me I think looks 45 but the boobs look like a 30 year olds.' She added: 'I think my friends and family will think I'm a tart but I don't care!' 200 Nips & Tucks and I Want More! is on Channel 5 this evening at 11pm or catch up with Demand 5 .","Linda Briggs has had more than 50 cosmetic procedures .

"Tennis ace Jamie Murray has said not enough has been done in Scotland to cash in on his brother Andy’s on-court success. Jamie, 28, hit out at the lack of facilities being built to bring youngsters through the ranks in this country following Andy’s grand slam wins. Former Wimbledon and US Open champ Andy, 27, is Britain’s No 1 player while Jamie lifted the Wimbledon mixed doubles title in 2007. Jamie Murray revealed his frustration at the state of Scottish tennis via his Twitter account . He wants to see more being done to improve the grassroots standard in the wake of brother Andy's success . Murray also wants to see an improvement in facilities and questioned why so little has been done . But Jamie has taken to Twitter to serve up a scathing broadside against sporting body Tennis Scotland. He said: “It’s so disappointing that nothing has been done to capitalise on Andy’s success and grow tennis in Scotland. Once in a lifetime opportunity! “You need vision and strong leadership to grow the game. Great to have role models but your only as good as your grassroots. So frustrating to see. Jamie (left) as a youngster alongside Andy (right) and their mother  Judy (centre) “Only two indoor courts built in past six years! And member of admin staff promoted to head up performance. What is going on at top of the tree?” Jamie’s stinging words come soon after Tennis Scotland president Ian Conway and his deputy Jacqui Duncan quit due to concerns over the recruitment process for staff. Lee Bouchar has recently been installed as interim head of performance at Tennis Scotland and will oversee a full review of management structures over the next six months. Plans to build a multi-million pound tennis and golf super-centre in between Murray’s home town of Dunblane and Bridge of Allan were lodged in July. The proposed development is backed by Murray’s mother Judy and Scottish golfing legend Colin Montgomerie. Jamie (right) in doubles action alongside brother and grand slam winner Andy (left) in 2011 . Tennis Scotland and the Lawn Tennis Association have also voiced their public support for the new centre. Jamie married his Colombian girlfriend Alejandra Gutierrez in 2010 in the Cromlix House hotel - the Dunblane property later bought by Andy. Andy acted as best man and the brothers kept in Scottish tradition by wearing their family kilts and sporran. The Great Britain tennis squad are set to face the US in the Davis Cup in Glasgow next year. It is thought the GB team will feature Andy.

"In a bid to cock a snook at the increasingly commercial nature of Christmas, we penned a note to the man in red and asked for a rural hideaway where crackling fires, bucolic splendour and wintry walks would distract us from John Lewis ads and Boxing Day sales. We would, we decided, load up our respective cars and head west with tinsel, turkey and a democratic approach to the washing up. Our setting for four days of cracker-pulling/pudding-igniting/fizz-quaffing was high up in the Blackdown Hills, an area of outstanding beauty on the border between Devon and Somerset. Winter escape: The Red Doors Farm Cottage is perfect for a Christmas break . Stunning view: The beautiful Devon cottage is situated on acres of farmland . Red Doors is not a farm per se. But with its thatched, stone cottages, airway-clearing smells and soundtrack of bleats and neighs, it certainly feels like the real deal. It is an agricultural retreat where the likes of you and I can walk the Old MacDonald walk - clad in wellies and wax jackets – without actually having to get our hands dirty. Indeed, those who do wind north from the A30, and nudge through the pillar-box red doors of any one of these six self-catering cottages, will find thoughtful plushness. Luxury rooms: One of the twin suites inside the beautiful country cottage . In spring: Byre Cottage is part of the wider Red Doors Farm - which sits in the Devon countryside . Do come in, the fire's on: Byre Cottage is an excellent spot to hide from the madness of Christmas . Owners Gill and Adrian have dedicated much of the last three years to ensuring that life on this farm isn’t that dissimilar to bedding down in a five-star hotel. Super comfy Vi Spring mattresses are draped in Egyptian cotton sheets. The bathrooms are new. There is wi-fi access and a code for the communal indoor swimming pool, where the waters are a toasty 30 degrees Celsius. Christmas Eve, so often stolen by last-gasp consumerism, passed instead in said heated waters  - with a side-venture into petting the farm’s animals. Red Doors’ guests are invited to help give breakfast to a host of its furry, four-legged inhabitants. This makes for a lovely introduction to farm life for younger children, for these are gentle breeds. We met chickens, ducks, a guinea pig called Gus and a pygmy goat called Dora. They seemed to be old hands at dealing with eager young faces (as long as you brandished carrots/grain in their direction). A world wonder: The Jurassic Coast - a splendid sight at any time of year - is within reach ofRed Doors Farm . Deep and crisp and even: Sidmouth can be a hugely picturesque place, even on a cold winter's day . December 25th arrived, and staying at Red Doors felt like the collective gift to ourselves that we had hoped it might be. Some of the rituals remained the same. By 8am, the living room was lost to shiny, scrunched-up paper. But it was spirit-lifting to be in unfamiliar, beautiful surroundings. And our cottage had everything we needed for a portable Christmas, including a decorated tree and a disposable roasting tin for the bird. After we had overindulged, 95 miles of fossil-laden, crumbling drama that is the Jurassic Coast was happy to put us through our paces. Book-ended by Exmouth in the west and Swanage in the east, this craggy wonder is easily accessible from Red Doors - as is the quiet, useful high street of nearby Honiton. The cobwebs were blown away on Boxing Day at Sidmouth, where we watched waves crash and foam from the safety of the esplanade before retreating into the pretty Regency streets for tea. Gill and Adrian are determined that Red Doors should be a year-round proposition. The Devon air bites in winter, but I can easily imagine these hills carpeted with flowers as the mercury rises. Fun for all the family: Guests at Red Doors Farm are encouraged to feed the (friendly) resident animals . Making a splash: If the weather outside is a little on the cold side, a dip in the pool will keep you warm . Spring brings snowdrops, daffodils, bluebells and crocuses on nearby Dumpdon Hill, an Iron Age fort. Guests can witness lambing, and watch cows lumbering past on their way to milking. There is also the tantalising prospect of long summer nights - grilling local cuts of meat on the BBQ; watching the kids battle with daylight to avoid checkmate on the outdoor chess set, or taking late-night leaps on the trampoline. The surrounding green hills are fertile with foodie produce. Our holiday cottage looked across at the Otter Valley Dairy, which serves homemade ice-cream in its summerhouse from March until October - but also opens in December to offer Christmas-themed gelato as an alternative to brandy butter. So it was Christmas but not as we knew it, as cosy as an English yuletide could be without snow. We relished the opportunity to tune out of urban life, gather around proper, sparking logs every night, and eat, drink and toast Old St Nick. And the washing up? Easy, we just switched on the dishwasher and went swimming. A week’s stay in Red Doors Farm's Byre Cottage for up to six people starts from £775 and a short break from £540.

"Paedophile: Michael Jackson held the child prisoner for three hours and sexually assaulting him after being dragged into his flat . A ‘predatory paedophile’ who changed . his name to Michael Jackson has been jailed indefinitely for snatching a . ten-year-old boy off the street in broad daylight. The sex attacker – who took the name . of the late singer to impress a former wife – was branded the ‘stuff of . every parent’s nightmare’ by the judge who sentenced him yesterday. Jackson, 50, marched the victim to . his housing association flat and threatened him at knifepoint, telling . him, ‘Scream and I’ll kill you’, before pushing him into an airing . cupboard, trussed up and naked from the waist down. During a three-and-a-half hour ordeal . the boy was sexually assaulted and told that if he cried out his father . would be murdered and he would never see his mother again. Jackson then left the flat to build . up an alibi by visiting friends, shutting the child in the cupboard to . be further abused at his ‘leisure’. Wolverhampton Crown Court heard the . victim had been popping to a corner shop for his mother when Jackson . pounced in Oldbury, West Midlands, last November. Jackson, who was known to the . authorities after committing similar offences in the 1980s, had . attempted to snatch the same boy four days earlier, chasing him to his . front door. The boy’s mother said in a victim . impact statement that the incidents had turned the family’s life ‘upside . down’, with the boy now too scared to venture out without his dog to . protect him. Judge Martin Walsh yesterday warned . the former pirate radio DJ he may never be released and ordered him to . serve a minimum of seven years before becoming eligible to apply for . parole. He said: ‘It is simply impossible to imagine the sheer terror experienced by that young child as a result of your actions. ‘I’m satisfied that had he not escaped, this young boy would have been subjected to serious sexual assaults or worse.’ No emotion: Jackson grabbed the 10-year-old boy when he went on a trip to local shops in November, 2011 . Crime scene: Police guard the block of flats in Oldbury, West Midlands, where predatory paedophile, Michael Jackson abducted a 10-year-old . The judge warned it was likely to be ‘very many years, if ever’ before Jackson would be judged fit for release. Debi Gould, prosecuting, said: ‘Nobody can imagine the terror  of such an experience for such a little boy.’ The child was freed after shuffling to a window when Jackson left and shouting to a family friend who was out searching for him. After Jackson was arrested, a . ten-year-old girl came forward to reveal how she had been abducted, tied . up and photographed by Jackson two months earlier, before he . ‘mercifully’ released her. Jackson moved to the flat where the . crime took place – in a block run by a housing association which works . to help resettle ex-offenders – in 2008 to be closer to his family. Tribute: Michael Jackson, formerly known as Albert English, with his now ex-wife Lisa Grose - had a large cut-out of the popstar Michael Jackson . Investigation: Forensic teams examine Jackson's window where the boy was seen with his arms bound and a white sheet wrapped around his body . The paedophile, born Albert English, . has amassed 20 convictions for 73 offences dating back to 1976, . including two similar sexual assaults from the early 1980s. He was jailed for 30 months after he . dragged a 13-year-old girl out of a lift at knifepoint in 1983 and took . her to his tower block flat at Smethwick, three miles from Oldbury. After tying her up with her own laces . he molested her during a seven-hour ordeal. She said he only let her . leave the property alive after she promised to be his girlfriend. That . victim lives just streets away from the boy he attacked last November. Jackson, who has at least one . grown-up child, admitted kidnap, sexual assault, false imprisonment and . kidnap with intent to commit a sexual offence in relation to the boy’s . disappearance. He also admitted the abduction of the ten-year-old girl and was ordered to sign the Sex Offenders’ Register.","The pervert, 50, grabbed the boy as he went to the shops and kept him prisoner in his flat .

"Love really is lovelier the second time around. Couples on their second marriage are happier and less likely to get divorced, a report claims. According to the Marriage Foundation, 45 per cent of marriages between first-timers are destined for the divorce courts. But just 31 per cent of second weddings will end in failure. And husbands who are tying the knot for the second time are more likely to find happiness. TV presenters Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan, who have been married for 26 years, are an example of successful second-timers . The relationships think-tank used figures from the Office for National Statistics to find out which marriages stand the test of time. It found those on their second union benefit from age and experience, and are more ready to commit. Rather than sliding into a marriage without much thought they will have carefully weighed the pros and cons. Harry Benson, who wrote the report for the Marriage Foundation, said: ‘Overall, second marriages do better because couples who get married for the second time are invariably older than those marrying for the first time. Couples on their second marriage are more likely to stay together as they benefit from the experiences of the past . ‘One possibility is that higher age is a proxy for higher income. Higher income acts as a buffer against some of the everyday difficulties faced by most couples. ‘Another possibility is that higher age means there are fewer young children from prior relationships. ‘And fewer second marriages for men are subject to the social and family pressures that lead into some first marriages. Hence men tend to do better second time round.’ He added: ‘The good news is that couples wishing to marry second time round no longer need to be put off by doom-laden statistics. Second marriages generally do OK.’ Relationship expert Dr Pam Spurr said that while previous statistics have shown that second marriages break down more quickly, maturity may well aid a second marriage. She added the second marriages can be particularly problematic when there are children from both previous marriages. And Relate counsellor Paula Hall pointed out that money can be tighter in a second marriage due to divorce settlements. But she added: ‘People in second marriages seem to have more insight and self-awareness. Having gone through divorce and separation, there can be more motivation to work through problems and save the marriage.’ TV presenters Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan, who have been married for 26 years, are an example of successful second-timers. Madeley had a brief marriage in his 20s but has told how he and his first wife were never well suited.","Marriage Foundation say 45 per cent of first marriages end in divorce .

"Favelas are often associated with Brazil - the dangerous slums that perch high on the hills around Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paolo. But Portugal has its own answer to the favelas of Brazil - Cova da Moura - a drug-trafficker's haven that has become a magnet for tourists. Around 1,000 tourists a year, including academics, architects and sociologists, are now willing to pay the five euro price for a tour of the slum's narrow, history-filled streets. A tourist stands in front of a Martin Luther King graffiti in the Cova da Moura neighborhood of Amadora . A man works at his shop in Amadora, Cova da Moura . However, taxi drivers still refuse to venture into the what was once one of Europe's most dangerous slums after dark. Inspired by the favela circuits launched in Brazil in recent years, the visits have a twin goal: 'to clean up the neighbourhood's image as a drug and crime haven, and give the local economy a boost,' said Miguel Lourenco, who runs the tourism project 'Sabura'. 'This isn't Montmartre or Barcelona's Gothic quarter, but our cultural heritage can take visitors into the world of Cape Verde, its food, crafts and music.'

But after Cape Verde's independence in 1975, they were joined by a mass influx of immigrants who built homes there illegally. Along with men and women from former colonies Angola and Guinea Bissau, they flocked to Portugal at a time when it was hungry for cheap labour. Forty years on, with the economic crisis biting hard, Cova da Moura is plagued with unemployment. Those who have work struggle as badly paid labourers or cleaners. 'A lot of young people sell drugs to put food on their families' tables,' said Spinola. Cova da Moura is often likened to the favelas of Brazil and the townships of South Africa . Tourists are led by a resident guide of the Cova da Moura neighbourhood . Others - armed with Portuguese qualifications - have headed home to Cape Verde, even though life there is now twice as expensive as Portugal. Godelieve Meersschaert first came to Cova da Moura from Belgium in 1982, as a young psychologist looking for a new experience. 'I liked the neighbourhood, and I'm still here,' she said. Together with her husband Eduardo, originally from the Azores islands, she founded an association called Moinho da Juventude - Mill of Youth - which has been working to improve local living conditions, including fighting for access to running water and sewage. The soft-spoken 69-year-old is on a mission to save Cova da Moura from demolition. 'Ten years ago, city hall wanted to tear down the neighbourhood and offer the land up to property developers. It is very well located, at the gates of Lisbon. 'They organised a campaign of slander on television to get people worked up against us,' she said. Tourists and sight-seers come together during the day as the Portuguese community is explored . Bino (right) works as a tour guide, where tourists are charged €5 to enter the Portuguese 'favela' A tourist (centre) leaves a coffee shop during a sightseeing tour of the area . Tours of the community helps revitalise its image and develop its local economy . So from there came the idea of opening up the area to tourists, to show another side of Cova da Moura. Police raids are frequent by night, but Cova da Moura is considered safe to visit - with a local guide - after sunrise, and the gangs seem to have reached a tacit decision to leave the tourists alone. One dealer even had an abortive go at a new career as a tour guide - before he was sent to jail for driving without a licence. Judging by the German tourists' reaction as they clap and cheer to a local rap video shot to denounce police violence - the PR operation is a success. For Sabine Oster, a pharmacist from Frankfurt, the tours 'show you the other side of Lisbon, instead of just visiting the same old monuments.' 'Exploring Cova da Moura is more than worthwhile,' she said.","Cova da Moura, north of Lisbon attracts 1,000 tourists a year .

"Soaring high above the Earth, this thrillseeker has a unique perspective on the planet below. Travelling in a glider, Jan Thinoks, from Lyon, France, captures stunning footage as he flies over the Vercours Massiff - a mountain range in east of the Rhone Valley. The video shows Thinoks taking to the sky in a number of different gliders, solo and with co-pilots. With the sun reflecting off the diverse landscape, views from the glider are incredible . He flies dangerously close to rock-faces, taking in greenery and snow depending on the day. With a large section of the plane made of perspex or glass, views from the cockpit are stunning and spectacular. Gliding is a skill that sees the pilot measure conditions of the day, such as wind strength and direction, and then direct the plane - which has no engine and only propellers. It's essential that all checks are carried out ahead of the glider getting airborne . Thinoks allows family and friends to enjoy his gliding adventure . It's definitely a thumbs up for the terrific views high above the Vercours in France . It is key to use 'lift' to continue your journey - this is taking advantage of invisible currents of air that can help to take your speed to around 100mph. Mr Massiff clearly enjoys the ride - spinning his glider upside down, and giving the camera the 'thumbs up' while overlooking incredible views. This is one for the strong of stomach as the pilot is pictured upside down . The pilot comes very close to the rock faces as he wants to take in all the surroundings . The snow-covered mountains are a spectacular sight that stretch for miles .

"A former New York City police officer cleared of conspiring to kidnap, kill, cook and eat women was sentenced to time served  Wednesday for illegally accessing a federal database. Gilberto Valle, 30, also received one year of probation, was ordered to continue to get mental health treatment and banned from contacting women involved in the case. Prosecutors are appealing Judge Paul Gardephe's decision to override a jury verdict and order Valle acquitted of conspiracy. Scot free: Gilberto Valle, 30, the former New York City police officer cleared of conspiring to kidnap, kill, cook and eat women, has been sentenced to time served Wednesday for illegally accessing a federal database . Conditional release: Valle (center) received one year of probation, was ordered to continue to get mental health treatment and banned from contacting women involved in the case . Media circus: Valle's sensationalist case has been closely covered by news outlets, and his court appearance Wednesday was no exception . Aspirations: Valle's attorneys said that he does not want the 'cannibal cop' stigma to become his legacy, and that at age 30 he still hopes to make something of his life . The ex-NYPD patrolman, pictured here on Wednesday with his defense team, was arrested in October 2012 after his wife found disturbing pictures on his computer . Valle was dubbed the 'cannibal cop' by news outlets after his 2012 arrest. Jurors heard evidence that he communicated online with people he had never met about killing and cooking his wife and others. In one of the numerous online conversations shown to the jury during the trial, Valle told a man he met in a fetish chat room: 'I want her to experience being cooked alive. She'll be trussed up like a turkey. ... She'll be terrified, screaming and crying.' In another exchange, Valle suggested a woman he knew would be easy prey because she lived alone. The men discussed cooking her, basted in olive oil, over an open fire and using her severed head as a centerpiece for a sit-down meal. The jury convicted him of conspiracy in July, but the judge wrote that evidence made it 'more likely than not the case that all of Valle's Internet communications about kidnapping are fantasy role-play.' He was facing life in prison. 'He didn't mean it': A judge concluded that Valle's Internet communications about kidnapping and cannibalism were nothing more than 'fantasy role-play' Disgraced: Valle was fired from the NYPD as a result of his legal troubles . Defense lawyers said previously that their client had suffered enough. 'He has lost nearly everything,' they said. 'He lost his job. He lost his liberty for 21 months. He lost his wife and his child. He lost many of his friends. He lost his reputation and anonymity.' The lawyers have said Valle now recognizes that the substance of his Internet chats was 'deeply troubling and disturbing' and meets weekly with a counselor to discuss it. 'Although having his sexual fantasies revealed in the public forum of this prosecution has been devastatingly embarrassing for Gil, there also is a sense of relief and liberation in being able to confront and overcome them,' the lawyers wrote. They added: 'Gil does not want his life's legacy to be the story of the ""Cannibal Cop."" He is only 30 years old and intends to make something more out of his life. Inspired by the team of people who defended his innocence, Gil wants to go to law school.' Valle, then a patrolman for the NYPD, was arrested in October 2012 after his wife, Kathleen Mangan, found disturbing pictures on his computer that he had downloaded from the site DarkFetishNet.com. The FBI found a list of 100 women he said he planned to kill, cook and eat. Sick fantasies: Valle told a man he met in a fetish chat room: 'I want her to experience being cooked alive. She'll be trussed up like a turkey' Future plans: His lawyers said that the 30-year-old has been inspired by his defense team to pursue a career in law . They also found a transcript of an online chat in which he said he planned to take his 'girlfriend' Kathleen to Pakistan, where he and another man would murder her and cannibalize her body. Valle maintains that his extensive writings were nothing more than fantasy - never meant to be acted on or carried out. Mangan, who testified against her husband at trial, was granted a divorce in July. She has taken the couple's young daughter and completely cut off all contact with Valle and his family.","Gilberto Valle, 30, received probation, was ordered to continue to get mental health treatment and banned from contacting women involved in the case .

"There can be few more startling examples of gentrification than New York’s Meatpacking District. In 1900 it was home to 250 abattoirs and packing plants – hence the name – in the 1980s it was a magnet for drug dealers and the Mafia – and now it’s one of the trendiest areas anywhere in the world, frequented by fashionistas, cocktail scenesters and more hipsters than you can shake a mojito at, not to mention handfuls of Manhattan’s celebrity population. They are drawn to high-end boutiques like Christian Louboutin, dining hot-spots such as Pastis and the hotel I’m staying at – the Gansevoort Meatpacking NYC. Hot spot: The Gansevoort is in the heart of the trendy Meatpacking district . It opened in 2004, with the likes of the Kardashians, Rihanna, Christina Aguilera, Sofia Vergara and Zoe Saldana all having checked in there since. I may not be a celebrity, but the staff there still treat you like one. Okay, they don’t ask for my autograph, but Mother Thornhill, my travelling companion, and I are treated with the utmost courtesy by the staff behind the reception desk and the bell boy gives us an enthusiastic tour of our ‘Deluxe’ roost. Cynics might say he’s angling for a big tip, but he seems sincere to me. In the room, my eye is immediately caught by a substantial-looking boom box, which connects to your phone and any playlists you have on it via Bluetooth. Further exploration reveals a mini-bar fit for a pop star, with Grey Goose vodka and Veuve Clicqout champagne. The beds, meanwhile, are seriously sizeable, and look incredibly comfortable. I throw myself onto mine. It is indeed worthy of the ‘deluxe’ nomenclature. The hotel’s website boasts that the linen is 400-thread Egyptian cotton, which I’m assuming is a mark of quality, judging by how tremendous they are to lie on. Comfort zone: The Gansevoort's bedrooms are spacious, stylish and luxurious . The headboards above them are a striking pink, which some might not find relaxing, but with the lights out, who cares? The bathroom is large, marbly, spotless, and festooned with luxe Cutler washing products. Half the space is covered by mirrors – I wouldn’t expect anything less given the hotel’s paparazzi-baiting clientele. There’s acres of space in the room, so you can really spread out. And plenty of light. Most hotels of note like to throw some art on the walls, and the Gansevoort is no different. We have a photograph of a woman with long hair, plus a photograph of a man and woman moving in for a kiss that’s presented in two separate frames. Very arty. Not to my taste, but a hat tip to the hotel for making the effort. All in all it’s a seductive environment – contemporary, a bit flash, but comfortable and welcoming. A good place to get your bearings at the Gansevoort is to ascend to the rooftop bar where you’ll find a big swimming pool and superb views over the Meatpacking District. Refreshing: A dip in the Gansevoort Meatpacking rooftop pool is a great way to start the day . Size matters: Ted languishes in one of the huge poolside chairs . I sip a cold sauvignon blanc and cast an eye over the neighbourhood. Right opposite is the lauded Pastis restaurant, a bit further beyond that is the revered High Line – a disused elevated railway that’s been transformed into a hipster’s nature reserve with pop-up bars and ice-cream stalls – and straight down below are the deeply uneven cobbled streets that swarms of taxis bounce along day and night. The fact that achingly fashionable media members club Soho House opened its New York branch here – just yards to the north-east, says it all. It’s a buzz zone that’s taken root. Much of the character of the Gansevoort Meatpacking is expressed in one fell swoop by the lobby. It’s expansive, airy, modern – and there’s a pool table. Trendy, but not uptight. It’s catwalk hipster every step of the way. The very cool Lobby Bar is the focal point, though. I recommend the Newton, Napa Valley, chardonnay they serve, but apparently the most popular tipple is a cocktail called ‘The District’ – made with ketel citroen, pomegranate syrup and lime juice. The outdoor section of the hotel’s restaurant, The Chester, meanwhile, is a superb place to not only dine on thoroughly decent fodder, but to soak up the vibrant Meatpacking atmosphere. Options include prime juicy steak, campanelle pasta tossed with mushrooms and broccoli and Atlantic salmon topped with bourbon glaze. It’s uncomplicated fare, cooked well, and always whisked out from the kitchen with friendly efficiency. High life: A good place to get your bearings at the Gansevoort is to ascend to the rooftop bar . Looking down from the Gansevoort to  the Meatpacking District. The High Line walk can be seen top right . Mother Thornhill enjoying a stroll along the High Line, which is just a few minutes' walk from the Gansevoort . Any hotel setting up shop in Meatpacking needs to have measures in place to shield its residents from the sounds of nighttime revelry. New York in general is noisy, but this district harbours a cluster of hotspots open till the early hours. Gansevoort just about succeeds. The beds prove to be monumentally comfortable, while solid double glazing tempers the sounds of the night right down. However, booking in here comes with the caveat that if you’re a very light sleeper, you may not get the most restful night. I’m stirred a couple of times by excitable hollering from the bar opposite our fourth-floor room – called Catch - but only briefly. I find that I like the hotel best in the morning. We establish a glorious routine of going for a swim in the rooftop pool and lounging in the brilliant oversized wicker chairs as the sunlight reaches out to us across the skyline. Then it’s downstairs for coffee, juice and eggs benedict outside at the Chester to watch Meatpacking come to life. I’m sad to say goodbye to the Gansevoort. It’s a hotel that has cleverly alchemised swagger, style and luxury with a welcoming atmosphere. No wonder the celebrities risk breaking their heels on Meatpacking’s cobbles to stay here. Rooms at Gansevoort Meatpacking NYC start at $425 per night. Visit www.gansevoorthotelgroup.com or phone (001) 877-426-7386 for reservations.

"As the sun sets behind the Atlas Mountains, the air hums with the call of cicadas, fragrant with the scent of the orange groves. The Royal Palm Marrakech rises majestically from the arid desert, 12 kilometres outside of the ancient Red City. A 'five-star plus' golf resort and villas sits on 231 hectares surrounded by palm trees, lavender bushes and over 4,000 olive trees. The Royal Palm Marrakech is a 'five star plus' resort at the foot of the Atlas Mountains, 12 kilometres from the ancient Red City .

The Medina's heady mix of crowded squares filled with street performers, smoky food stands and bartering tourists is soon forgotten as I arrive in this oasis of luxurious calm and understated opulence. The impressive lobby is entered across an over-water footbridge, surrounded by pits aglow with fire. Inside, the decor is a harmonious blend of contemporary design and traditional Berber motifs.

The Presidential Suite is a staggering 310 square-metres with separate wings and a terrace with panoramic views . Private villas are secluded and set amid the olive groves, each with its own pool and hammam. Six tiers of suites range from 72 square-metre Junior Suite up to the magnificent 310 square-metre Presidential Suite. Make no mistake: Royal Palm Marrakech is not the kind of hotel where you need to worry about being dumped in a windowless, oversized broom cupboard. As much care and attention is given to the sleek design and elegant touches of the lowest level suite as there is to the Prince Villa. Limestone tiles are a welcome coolness underfoot after returning from a day poolside under the blazing Moroccan sun or negotiating the frenetic souks. Marble bathrooms with sunken tubs also feature outdoor showers in the opulent Prince villa . Take a jacuzzi with a view of snow-capped mountains in the Presidential Suite .

"Lawyers will argue Wednesday whether a man accused of pushing his wife off a cliff to her death in Colorado's Rocky Mountain National Park as they celebrated their wedding anniversary should remain in jail. The federal detention hearing comes after Harold Henthorn, 58, was indicted last week on a charge of first-degree murder in the death of Toni Henthorn, 50. An autopsy report says she fell or was pushed over the ledge when she paused to take a photo during a hike on Sept. 29, 2012. The couple was visiting the park for their 12th wedding anniversary. This week, a federal grand jury indicted Harold Henthorn on a charge of first-degree murder more than two years after his wife, Toni, tumbled face first to her death off a ledge in Colorado's Rocky Mountain National Park. Harold is accused of the murder . Happier times: This undated photograph provided by the Bertolet family shows Toni Henthorn. Harold Henthorn, Toni's husband, was indicted by a federal grand jury this week on a charge of first-degree murder more than two years after his wife fell to her death in Rocky Mountain National Park . Only after her death did Toni Henthorn's relatives realize she was covered by three life insurance policies totaling $4.5 million. A claim was sent in for one policy days after she died, court records show. Harold Henthorn's attorney, Craig L. Truman, has said that the case is complicated and that 'justice will be done' once the facts come to light. Loss: His first wife, Sandra Lynn, was killed in a freak accident when their car crushed her as she changed a flat tire . Toni Henthorn was an ophthalmologist with her own practice in Jackson, Mississippi, when she met her husband, who told her he was wealthy and persuaded her to move with him to the Denver suburb of Highland Ranch, her brother, Todd Bertolet told The Associated Press. But once in Colorado, he seemed controlling and obsessed with money, Bertolet said. Toni Henthorn's relatives were not convinced her husband owned his own business, even though he would take regular work trips without explanation. Bertolet said Harold Henthorn was reluctant to talk about the death of his first wife, Sandra Lynn Henthorn, 30, who was crushed to death in 1995 when a car slipped off a jack while she and Harold were changing a flat tire. Reports emerged showing that Dr Henthorn, who had one daughter, had life insurance policies to the value of $4.5 million - and that a claim was made on one of the policies just two days after her death. The indictment says Harold Henthorn, who was the only witness to her death, 'willfully, deliberately, maliciously and with premeditation and malice aforethought did unlawfully kill his wife', CBS reported. After she passed away, it emerged that his first wife had also died in mysterious circumstances, and the investigation into that death has since been re-opened. Sandra Lynn Henthorn, 37, was crushed to death after the couple's car slipped off a jack while she and Harold Henthorn were trying to change a flat tire one late night  in 1995. Frequent hikers: Family photos frequently show the Henthorns enjoying themselves in the rugged landscapes of Colorado--just the type of backdrop of Toni's death. Here the couple are pictured with their daughter . Accused: Harold Henthorn, left, has been accused of murdering his wife, Dr Toni Henthorn, right, who fell to her death while the couple took a hike at Rocky Mountain National Park in September 2012 . Watch the full report on CBS Denver here. He told authorities that his wife had been reaching under the car to help him change the front tire on their Jeep Cherokee on the rural road, when the jack slipped. Detectives closed the case just one week after the investigation, ruling the death an accident, but the Douglas County Sheriff's Office told CBS4 that they have now re-opened the investigation. A source told the channel that Henthorn had taken out a $300,000 insurance policy on his wife. It added that three life insurance policies had been taken out on his second wife - each valued at $1.5 million - and that efforts had been made to collect on it on the first business day after her death. One of the policies named the Harold and Toni Henthorn Trust as the beneficiary and a claim was sent in for the policy on October 1, 2012, CBS reported. No payment was made, however. It is not clear who attempted to file a claim for the policy. The claim was made before her body was cremated or a memorial service was held. Dr Henthorn, an ophthalmologist, had been married to her husband for 12 years. She left behind a daughter, then seven. Toni Henthorn's family told CBS4 that they learned of her husband's arrest on Thursday morning. Mystery: Harold Henthorn told authorities his wife slipped on a steep mountainside while taking a photo . Family: Dr Henthorn, a skilled ophthalmologist, left behind a seven-year-old daughter when she died in 2012 . Her brother Todd Bertolet expressed relief that federal authorities had made an arrest. 'We've always had the utmost confidence in very talented people with the FBI and the National Park Service,' he said. 'We've always felt that justice would come one day and this is a satisfactory day in knowing that justice for Toni is proceeding along.' Harold Henthorn's attorney, Craig Truman, added: 'We know when all the facts are known in this difficult case that justice will be done.' 'We've always had the utmost confidence in very talented people with the FBI and the National Park Service,' he said. 'We've always felt that justice would come one day and this is a satisfactory day in knowing that justice for Toni is proceeding along.' Harold Henthorn's attorney, Craig Truman, added: 'We know when all the facts are known in this difficult case that justice will be done.' If convicted, Henthorn faces a mandatory life sentence in prison with no possibility of parole and a fine of up to $250,000 .

"The ex-wife of Strictly Come Dancing winner Mark Ramprakash slashed her brother's arm with a broken glass after he found her semi-conscious and surrounded by empty bottles on the sofa, a court has heard. Vandana Bhatt, who split from the former England cricketer in 2010, was found by her brother Nitin, on the sofa demanding 'more wine'. But she was acquitted at St Albans' Magistrates Court today after prosecutors were unable to prove the injury was caused deliberately . Vandana Bhatt, left, who was accused of slashing her brother Nitin's, right, arm after he found her semi-conscious and surrounded by empty bottles . The court had heard how her brother, Mr Bhatt, went to his sister's home in Watford, on July 12 to check on her after the 44-year-old had called him to beg for his help. As he attempted to help her, she bit down on a thin tumbler glass and slashed his arm with the broken shards, magistrates were told. The court heard how Bhatt was left with cuts to her mouth and nose, while her brother was left with a 'nasty injury' that caused 'significant blood loss'. Police arrived and she was arrested and later charged with assault by beating. Prosecutor Harry Snook told the court: 'At the time, the defendant was alcohol dependant and had been drinking that day. 'There may be some uncertainty as to how intoxicated she was. 'The complainant is the defendant’s brother. He became concerned during the day about her welfare and he travelled some distance to check on her. Mark Ramprakash, pictured with Bhatt after he won Strictly Come Dancing in 2006. The couple separated in 2010 . 'We say, having gained access to the premises, he found her in an intoxicated state and, during what followed, she broke a glass and she cut her brothers arm with the glass, causing a relatively nasty injury.' Bhatt broke down in tears as her brother, who himself was a self-confessed alcoholic for ten years, described the attack, which took place in front of his son. He said: 'She had called me as was just saying ""please help me"". 'We got to the property at about 5.30. When we reached the lounge she was semi-conscious on the sofa and there was lots of alcohol bottles on the floor. 'When she saw us, she just said ""give me some wine"". I didn't want my son to see his auntie in that state so I sent him upstairs. The court heard that Bhatt was granted a quickie divorce from Mr Ramprakash, pictured with dance partner Karen Hardy, on the grounds of her unreasonable behaviour . 'She had a very thin glass in her hand. This was behaviour I had never seen from her before. She bit into the glass and part of it disintegrated. She cut her mouth and she was bleeding from her mouth and nose. 'She had been trying to drag herself to the kitchen but then she got to a height where she lunged at me with the glass.' The court heard how Bhatt, divorced from Mr Ramprakash in 2010 on the grounds of unreasonable behaviour, had not been eating for several months and her weight had plunged to seven stone prior to the incident. Mr Bhatt, who had retracted his witness statement prior to the trial and asked for her case to be dropped, told the court he did not believe she meant to hurt him. The court heard that after Bhatt split from the former England cricketer, she had not been eating for several months and her weight plummeted to seven stone . The RBS senior bank manager, who broke down in tears himself on several occasions during his testimony, said: 'I don’t know that, at that time, her lunging at me with the glass was a malicious action. It wasn’t to harm me or to do me any damage at all. 'I believe it was a case of, with her broken ankle, her falling into me. We wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for the shock and the adrenalin that kicked in at the time. She is not a violent person and has never been. 'There was a lot of blood lost and there is a scar.' Defence lawyer Gabrielle Moore told magistrates they should dismiss the charge on the grounds of there being no case to answer. She said: 'It was clearly an involuntary act based on the evidence of her brother. She was in a very fragile state at the time.' Magistrates took less than 30 minutes before confirming the case would be dismissed - an announcement that brought further tears to Bhatt. Chairman of the bench Kevin Walsh said: 'We do not find there is a case to answer because we don't find that a tribunal could convict on the evidence up to this point. 'We say that because Mr Bhatt said under oath that he believed the injury was caused by her falling on to him. For those reasons we dismiss the case.' Ms Bhatt made no comment as she left court.","Vandana Bhatt called brother Nitin who went to her house to check on her .

"With ski holiday season upon us, families will be booking flights to mountaintop resorts for winter wonderland getaways in the coming weeks. But while travellers may think they have snared a great deal, unexpected fees for bulky ski baggage may land them with a far more expensive airfare than originally thought. With this in mind, Skyscanner has created a guide outlining the cost of bringing ski equipment on flights. The cost of skiing: A new guide from Skyscanner compares the cost of bringing ski equipment on flights . The guide compares more than 20 airlines, including Ryanair, easyJet, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, to see which of them allow ski equipment such as skis, boots and poles, to be taken within normal hold luggage allowance or whether additional fees are charged. Additional fees for ski baggage may result in what seemed like a cheap flight tripling in cost. For example, a Ryanair flight from London to Grenoble is £24.99 each way. Add extra 'ski fees', and the end cost is £189.98 return with ski equipment. In comparison, the £189.14 flight with BA includes ski equipment up to 23kg. Size restrictions on baggage are also a factor: While Air France, Air Berlin and KLM allow bags of up to 300cm, others such as US Airways, Austrian, United and more restrict baggage to 158cm.","Skyscanner guide analyses airline fees including Ryanair, easyJet and BA .

"Raided: Model and actress Belen Rodriguez posted online: 'I got all the presents, in two days we leave!' A showgirl's Christmas was ruined when her Milan home was burgled after she posted details of her travel plans on Facebook. Model and actress Belen Rodriguez had reportedly taken boyfriend Stefano De Martino home to meet her family in South America when her apartment was targeted by thieves. Just days before the break-in, the Argentinian TV star had written on Facebook: 'Ok! I got all the presents, in two days we leave! It's been five years since I've had Christmas with my family, I'm really happy!' On December 20, the 28-year-old added: 'Ok... last working day before departure. I'll keep you updated! Kisses!' The thieves broke into the elegant apartment building she shares with her dancer boyfriend through a window on the night of December 23. A porter noticed the open window the next morning and called the police after trying unsuccessfully to contact Ms Rodriguez. The television personality has dated a series of high-profile men including Italian footballer Marco Borriello and Sicilian TV star Fabrizio Corona. Last year, a sex tape apparently featuring Belen and then-boyfriend Tobias Blanco was posted online. The burglary is not the only crime committed by opportunistic thieves in Italy over Christmas. Steel baron Giorgio Falck's widow Silvia's Milan home was also raided, with intruders taking jewellery, gold and certificates of deposit worth 200,000 euros.

"A local strolling on a beach in Cape Town has snapped terrifying photos of a deadly Cape cobra in the shallows. The snake, which was estimated to be up to 1.8m in length was spotted on Hout Bay beach, make its way along the sand to the water. Photos have since been shared on social networking sites, with Hout Bay resident Jeffery Rinks among those who managed to capture the snake on camera. A combination of deadly snake and sharks could make Hout Bay the world's most dangerous beach . The snake was trapped between photographer and the shark-infested water . Speaking to South African radio station 567 CapeTalk, snake and reptile expert Shaun Macleod said: 'That's fantastic, that's a beautiful size, they seldom get to that size.' He explained that snakes soak in water when they are about to shed as their skin gets irritated and says it probably ended up in the water on this occasion because the photographer was blocking its escape route. He said: 'So the snake was trying everything it could to move away from the photographer and ended up in the water, it's a fantastic shot. It looks like the guy's having a surf, [it's] fantastic.' Experts explained that the snake would only become dangerous if it is disturbed or people tamper with it and Macleod said 98 per cent of snake bites are self-inflicted. Hout Bay is known for its shark-infested waters and boat tours can be taken by visitors to see seal colonies and other marine life. The photos of the cobra were shared on Twitter, with many expressing their shock and disbelief at the size of the snake, as well as the situation itself. Residents who live on Hout Bay have voiced their worry after the deadly cobra was spotted on the beach . Ina Gouws ‏wrote on Twitter: 'I'd collapse; scared to death,' while Thandile Ntshwanti said: 'This thing about the cobra and the beach in Cape Town, just messed up my holiday plans... Can't be swimming with no cobras. Ayanda Shayi wrote: 'A 2 meter long cobra having a swim in Cape Town Hout Bay... I think we need to review our vacation plan,' and JodieCocker added: 'Just when we thought it was safe to venture onto the beach or into the sea.. BOOM - Cape Cobra of Fear!' Iain Macdonald said: 'This must have been an impressive sight to see, especially the size of this Cape Cobra snake on Hout Bay beach.' Meanwhile residents who live near to where the cobra was spotted have voiced their safety concerns after the release of the pictures. The snake was ushered away from people and dogs by beach-goers throwing sand towards it . Speaking to the Daily Sun Lungisa Benzile said: 'I was shocked when I saw photos of that huge snake crawling on the beach. 'We will avoid the beach. We have had problems with snakes here before.' CapeTalk were contacted by Hout Bay-based Rinks, who told the radio station that along with a friend, they managed to encourage the snake off the sand and under a log until the reptile experts arrived to capture the animal. 'I immediately made sure people kept away from it, put the dog on a leash, and my priority then was to ensure the safety of the snake and the people and dogs that were out. 'I was joined by a woman who quite confidently suggested we try and herd the snake away from the water. 'Between the two of us we threw sand at the snake. Eventually the snake came up to a log and I stayed with (it) for about an hour.'","Snake spotted taking a dip on Hout Bay beach, in Cape Town, South Africa .

"Andy Murray will use his first appearance in London since Wimbledon to try and win back some of the followers he lost by publicly declaring his support for the break-up of the United Kingdom. The former Wimbledon champion opens the Barclays World Tour Finals at the 02 Arena on Saturday with a group match against Japan's Kei Nishikori, who is making his debut in the field open only to the season's top eight performers. Murray spent six weeks battling to qualify, and it will be interesting to see if there is any delayed fallout from his Tweet in the early hours of Scottish referendum day, in which he revealed a late conversion to the idea of independence. Andy Murray smiles during a press conference ahead of the ATP World Tour Finals in London . The British No 1 finished the year strongly to qualify for the elite eight-man event . Murray (centre) was involved in a 'selfie' with his fellow ATP World Tour Finals competitors on Friday . 'I haven't had an adverse reaction, the crowd has always given me very good support when I have played here and when I have played at Wimbledon and Queen's throughout my whole career,' he said. 'I hope this week that is the same, but if not I will do my job and give my best effort regardless. Hopefully I'll win back some fans this week.' The sometimes impulsive Murray recently intimated he regrets the way he expressed himself, having managed to alienate numerous supporters in England and Scotland – not to mention upsetting his sponsors – in less than 140 characters. Murray will face US Open finalist Kei Nishikori in his first group rubber at the finals . He has also reaffirmed his pride in representing Great Britain, but definitely he has much ground to make up after five years spent winning over more sceptical sections of the public with his maturity and outstanding career achievements. Given the nature of tennis support in this country there is unlikely to be any perceptible hostility in the coming week, although this is an event where his backing has not been as unequivocal as it is at Queen's or Wimbledon. Two years ago he played Roger Federer at the 02 and the cheering made it hard to tell who was the home player, although that was largely down to the Swiss master's global icon status and the international mix of the huge crowds this tournament attracts. Murray also shares a group with Roger Federer, who has beaten him three times at the season ending finale . Federer often receives equal support to Murray at the finals, despite the Scot's home advantage . He is sure to play Federer again this week and will have to turn round a strangely poor record against the 33 year-old at the east London venue, which sees the world number two having won on all three occasions. Murray does not believe crowd support has been a factor, more the excellence of Federer in these conditions: 'The reason why he is difficult to beat is that he is incredibly good on these courts. He is a fantastic indoor player and has been all his career. When there is no wind or sun to throw him off, when he is on his game, he is incredibly tough to beat, but hopefully I will be able to do it this week.' Novak Djokovic wins the Paris Masters without dropping a set shortly after the birth of his first child . The Serbian is more than likely to finish the year as the world's No 1 ranked player . Take away the World Finals in London and the 27 year-old Scot leads their career series 11-8. 'I'm quite surprised how well I have played Andy here, some matches I thought I might lose,' said Federer. 'I don't see this surface being helpful either to me or to him.' The Swiss could mathematically take the year-end number one spot this week, but that would require an unexpected collapse from the incumbent Novak Djokovic, a three-times winner who has a habit of finishing the season strongly. Any suspicions that Djokovic might be distracted by the birth of his first child three weeks ago where quashed at the Paris Masters, which he won without dropping a set.","Andy Murray is set to open against Kei Nishikori at ATP World Tour Finals .

"A 16-year-old cancer sufferer who raised more than $45,000 for pediatric cancer and inspired a nationwide awareness campaign has passed away. Alex Muñoz, who inspired the 'Team Alex' campaign, died on Wednesday afternoon 'after a courageous 19 month battle with brain and spinal cancer,' his family wrote on his Facebook page. 'He was 16 years old and the light of our lives,' they wrote. 'He will be forever missed and forever loved.' Muñoz, from Oceanport, New Jersey, was diagnosed with medulloblastoma, a malignant brain tumor, in April 2013 and underwent radiation, chemotherapy and brain surgery. Loss: Alex Muñoz, pictured front right with Stephen Colbert and his parents, has passed away after a 19 month battle with brain and spinal cancer, aged just 16. He had inspired the campaign 'Team Alex' But when he returned for a routine MRI check up, doctors found that the cancer had returned, far more aggressively, in his spine. 'But he stayed very positive and didn't want the attention to be on him,' his mother Laura told NJ Advance Media in an interview last month. 'He wanted the focus to be on fighting brain tumors.' The Kortney Rose Foundation, which was set up by the parents of nine-year-old Kortney after she died from brain cancer in 2006, heard of Alex and got in touch to hold a fundraiser for him. But he wouldn't allow them to focus their fundraising on paying for his medical expenses and instead asked to join them to raise money for pediatric cancer research. Tragic: The high school student, pictured before his treatment, was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2013 . Fight: Alex is pictured with his family during a Caribbean cruise he took with the Make-A-Wish Foundation . Staying upbeat: Alex, pictured with Charlie the therapy dog in August, always remained positive, family said . By last month, approximately $45,000 had been donated in Alex's name for pediatric brain cancer research, his mother said. When the Muñoz family learned that his condition was much worse than they thought, Kortney Rose's mother Kristen Gillette designed t-shirts and wristbands reading: Team Alex - No One Fights Alone.' Within days, the campaign of support unexpectedly took off in the community, as local leaders, residents and university students shared photos of their 'Team Alex' signs. His classmates started the hashtags #StayStrongAlex and #NoOneFightsAlone on social media, while people from across the country wrote him messages of support. Even Stephen Colbert invited Alex and his family to attend a taping of his show 'The Colbert Report', where he posed with the star. 'Alex Muñoz is a clear example of selflessness and caring, and he is by all accounts, a great kid,' his principal at Shore Regional Vinnie DalliCardillo said last month. Support: Members of his community started posting signs reading 'Team Alex - No One Fights Alone' Loved: University of Florida fraternity brothers wore gray in support of Team Alex just a few weeks ago . Alex, pictured with his parents,  was invited to the set of the Colbert Report and met the host last month . 'When you see all of those signs and see how he has affected the kids around him, it is a tribute to him and his contributions to this community.' He was moved to in-home hospice care in October, but he never stopped appreciating the messages. 'He is so incredibly moved,' Laura Muñoz said. 'He is so amazed and overwhelmed. It's just given him such great, great joy.' After news of his death, friends paid tribute to the teenager on his Facebook page. 'I may have been his kindergarten teacher, but Alex taught me so much more about character and strength,' Carole Bisti Valentino wrote. 'He led by example, with hope, kindness, love for his family and that infectious smile! He is and will always be my hero.'","Alex Muñoz, 16, passed away in New Jersey on Wednesday after battling brain and spinal cancer since April 2013 .

"Pilot Peter Siebold, 43, (pictured) was seriously injured and co-pilot Michael Alsbury, 39, killed in the Virgin Galactic crash in the Mojave Desert . The pilot who survived the horrific Virgin Galactic crash has told investigators how he was thrown clear of the spacecraft as it broke up before plummeting nearly ten miles back to Earth. Peter Siebold, 43, also told the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) that he was unaware the feathering system which controls descent had been unlocked early by co-pilot Michael Alsbury. Mr Alsbury, 39, was killed in the crash in the Mojave Desert in California last month and father-of-two Mr Siebold was seriously injured. Giving an update of its investigation today, the NTSB said that the on-scene part of its probe had finished and that the wreckage of the spacecraft had been recovered. It is now being stored in a secure location for a follow-up examination. The NTSB said: 'The NTSB operations and human performance investigators interviewed the surviving pilot on Friday. 'According to the pilot, he was unaware that the feather system had been unlocked early by the co-pilot. 'His description of the vehicle motion was consistent with other data sources in the investigation. 'He stated that he was extracted from the vehicle as a result of the break-up sequence and unbuckled from his seat at some point before the parachute deployed automatically.' The NTSB said its investigation was continuing. Mr Siebold, an experienced pilot, blacked out as the craft broke up around him at 50,000ft but was saved by his emergency parachute. He only regained consciousness halfway into his fall and managed to give a thumbs-up to colleagues in a passing aircraft to show he was alive. Scroll down for video . The Virgin Galactic SpaceShip 2 crashed in the Mojave Desert in California last month during a test flight . The plane separated mid-air, causing Mr Alsbury, 39, to plummet to the earth while still strapped in his seat . Mr Siebold (right) also told the US National Transportation Safety Board that he was unaware the feathering system which controls descent had been unlocked early by Mr Alsbury (left), who was killed in the crash . Earlier, he said: 'I must have lost consciousness at first. I can't remember anything about what happened but I must have come to during the fall. 'I remember waving to the chase plane and giving them the thumbs-up to tell them I was OK. I know it's a miracle I survived.' The body of Mr Alsbury was found still strapped into his seat on a desert road by construction workers. His parachute did not deploy. His wife Michelle said she had 'lost the love of my life'. Preliminary investigations suggest that the rocket ship’s folding wings – designed to slow it down and achieve safe speeds during landing – deployed early, causing the ship to break up due to the tremendous turbulence around the craft. Mr Alsbury was trapped in the cockpit but Mr Siebold was thrown clear of the wreckage or somehow unbuckled his seatbelt. He then plunged towards Earth at speeds topping 120mph. Hundreds of people have signed up for the Virgin Galactic experience which will take tourists into space. Virgin Galactic is building a replacement spaceship and says test flights could resume as early as next summer. Representatives for Virgin Galactic said they were unable to comment on the NTSB investigation or any details surrounding it when contacted by MailOnline.

"She may be pregnant with her second baby but Una Foden won't have to worry about shifting her baby weight next year. The 33-year-old star of The Saturdays reveals that she's been following a healthy diet and exercise regime over the last few months and she's even been snapped up by Reebok to model the sporty brand's latest range. Posing in a series of promotional images before she announced her baby news, Una shows off her trim and toned figure in her second campaign for the athletic apparel brand. Scroll down for video . Trim star: The Saturdays singer Una Foden is currently modelling Reebok's latest range of women's athletic apparel and while the campaign was shot before her pregnancy was announced, the healthy star will no doubt have no trouble slipping back into her pre-baby figure . 'It's great to be back for a second time around,' Una told MailOnline. And with her passion for health and fitness, it seems she's a perfect fit. 'I've just come off tour with The Saturdays and I was very, very fit in preparation. We were dancing all day every day and had an hour and a half on stage,' she said. Sporty star: The 33-year-old, who recently announced she's expecting her second baby with husband Ben Foden, follows a healthy lifestyle and loves working out and whizzing up healthy vegetable juices at home . Shaping up: Now that she's pregnant, Una has been doing less strenuous activities such as walking and swimming to keep her healthy . 'However, my approach to fitness during my pregnancy has been very different and not as strenuous. I've been doing lots of walking and swimming and I'd love to give yoga a go as it looks amazing.' As well as a committed exercise regime, Una follows a balanced diet but proving that she's just like the rest of us, she allows herself treats, too. 'I eat very healthily and I love using my juicer to whiz up fruit and vegetable juices. 'As for treats, I don't have a sweet tooth, I'm more of a savoury person and love salty foods. At home, Sunday is takeaway day and we have Indian, pizza or Chinese. Obviously I don't eat as much as Ben,' she said of her England rugby star husband. Treat days: While she follows a healthy and balanced diet, Una and her family treat themselves to a takeaway every Sunday . Beauty secrets: To maintain her glossy hair, Una's secret won't break the bank - she swears by Garnier Ultimate Blends' £2.99 The Sleek Restorer Intensive 1 Minute Treatment . As well as showcasing a honed physique, Una's good looks have been well documented since her ascent to fame with the girl band, but the singer claims she didn't even know how to apply false eyelashes before joining The Saturdays. 'We are constantly in hair and makeup with the band and we are always exchanging beauty tips,' she said. 'I couldn't even apply false eyelashes before I joined but now, thanks to all the tips I've learnt from makeup artists, I can do my own makeup to a high standard.' While she admits she never leaves the house without base and mascara (because she feels 'naked' without it), after a long day on stage, Una loves nothing more than coming home and taking the day off. 'I have a simple skincare regime, just cleanse, tone and moisturise and my secret to good skin is plenty of water and sleep. Mentor: Una is currently in Ireland filming The Voice, where she will mentor the singing hopefuls alongside Rachel Stevens . 'I come home and can't wait to take my make-up off after we've been on tour and just be natural, I've been loving Clinique's Sonic System Purifying Cleansing Brush - it leaves my skin feeling amazing,' she said. As for her glossy hair, beauty aficionados will be pleased to hear that Una's secret won't break the bank - she swears by Garnier Ultimate Blends' £2.99 The Sleek Restorer Intensive 1 Minute Treatment, which, she says, is amazing for coloured hair like hers. Stylewise, the mother-of-one says she loves getting dressed up for a night out but loves to chill out in comfy clothes when she's at home - and is a rock chic at heart. She said: 'I love dressing rocky when I'm not on stage with The Saturdays. I love skinny jeans, a leather jacket and boots - a bit Kate Moss. I also love the boho look so I'd say my ideal style is somewhere between Miranda Kerr and Nicole Richie.' As well as being pregnant with a baby boy, The Saturdays star, who already has a two-year-old daughter Aoife Belle with her rugby player husband, is set to appear as a coach on Ireland's The Voice. 'I can't wait to be a mentor,' she said. 'We are there to find some real talent so I can't wait to get stuck in,' she said.

"Controversial Ryanair chief, Michael O'Leary, recently admitted it was time to put customers first. And now, the carrier once voted second worst brand in the world, not to mention Britain's least favourite airline, is claiming to be Europe's number one for customer service. The airline has announced that more than 92 per cent of more than 50,000 Ryanair flights in October arrived on time – a one percent improvement on the same month last year. Putting customers first: The budget carrier  has called itself 'Europe's number one customer service airline' Michael O'Leary has said he should have been nicer to customers sooner . The no-frills airline carried 8.4 million passengers in the month and claimed to have received fewer than one complaint per 1,000 travellers. A statement on its website added that 'more than 99 per cent of complaints were answered within seven days'. Ryanair said the passenger statistics for last month confirm it as Europe's 'number one customer service airline'. This follows a website relaunch, mobile app, allocated seating and the ability to carry a small second bag on board flights. Ryanair Head of Communications, Robin Kiely, said: 'Ryanair carried 8.4m customers in October with over 92 per cent of our 50,000 flights arriving on-time as we continued to improve our customer experience. The airline has made a number of improvements including allowing passengers a second bag on board . 'All Ryanair customers may now bring a small second bag on board, make faster bookings and register their details on our easier to use website and brand new app, travel with mobile boarding passes, enjoy ""quiet flights"" and allocated seating, and use their personal electronic devices at all stages of their flight, as Ryanair continues to deliver so much more than just the lowest fares in every one of our markets.' In March this year, Ryanair revealed that it was undergoing a revolutionary image change. Mr O'Leary said the airline had an 'Always Getting Better' plan, with the aim of 'fixing the things our customers don' like.' The airline relaxed its  cabin baggage allowance, introduced allocated seating and reduced penalties for failing to print out boarding passes. Even renowned hard-nosed businessman O'Leary seemed to be showing a softer side. Last month, in an exclusive interview with MailOnline Travel, Mr O'Leary admitted that 'We should have been nicer to customers earlier than we have been'. It comes just a month after Ryanair was named one of the worst brands in the world by customers, second only to insurance company AXA. Despite recent efforts to transform its reputation, the budget airline was one of the worst-performing brands overall in Siegel+Gale's 2014 simplicity index. In a survey of more than 12,000 customers in eight countries, Ryanair was named the second worst-ranked brand, based on ease of customer use of a company's products, services, interactions and communications.","92% of 50,000 Ryanair flights in October arrived on time .

"Tragic Tetra Pak billionaire Hans Rausing has celebrated his marriage to Christie's art expert Julia Delves Broughton four months after saying 'I do' with a glittering party in Mayfair. The couple married in front of just 60 guests at private ceremony in July, but marked their nuptials with a larger event at prestigious venue One Mayfair last night, with friends in attendance including musician and television presenter Jools Holland, who attended with his wife Christabel. The bride was given away by Lord Teddy Derby, with Brian Ferry's son Otis, his model girlfriend Edie Campbell and his mother Lucy Birley also in attendance, as well as Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason. Happy couple: Tragic Tetra Pak billionaire Hans Rausing has celebrated his marriage to Christie's art expert Julia Delves Broughton four months after saying 'I do' with a glittering party in Mayfair. The couple are pictured last month at a charity event . The marriage marks a fresh start for Mr Rausing, whose first wife, Eva, died in 2012 as a result of cocaine abuse. Her decomposing body was found at their £70million Chelsea home several weeks later. Former heroin addict Mr Rausing, 50, first met Ms Delves Broughton, 53, in 2002, but is thought to have re-kindled the relationship after he entered a psychiatric hospital following his former wife's tragic death. American-born Eva had died from an overdose, but Mr Rausing had hidden her body under a mound of bin bags and bedding for two . months while maintaining a  pretence to servants that she was . still alive. He said she was suffering a fever and he was taking her temperature three times a day. Musical guests: Among the guests at the wedding were musician and television presenter Jools Holland, who attended with wife Christabel (left), and Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason (right), pictured with his wife Nettie . Rausing was convicted in July 2012 of preventing her lawful burial and handed a ten-month suspended jail term. The judge at Isleworth Crown Court said Mr Rausing was a tragic warning of the 'utterly destructive' effects of drug abuse. Judge Richard McGregor-Johnson told Rausing as he sentenced him: 'If ever there was an illustration of the utterly destructive effects of drug misuse on individuals and their families, it is to be found in the facts of this case. 'You and your wife had every material advantage imaginable, and for a time a happy family life. Your relapse into the misuse of drugs, together with that of your wife, destroyed all that.' Mr Rausing . - whose Swedish grandfather founded the lucrative food packaging firm . in 1951 - met Eva Kemeny while they were both enrolled on a drugs rehabilitation programme. Rock royalty: Brian Ferry's son Otis attended the wedding with his model girlfriend Edie Campbell and his mother, Lucy Birley (right) Glitterrati: Hedge fund boss Rod Barker with his partner, television presenter and journalist Tania Bryer were at the party, as were Philip Knatchbull, son of Patricia Knatchbulll, 2nd Countess Mountbatten of Burma with his wife Wendy .

Hat's off: Milliner Philip Treacy (right) was also at last night's party, wearing a distinctive embroidered waistcoat with a blue shirt . They married in 1992 and had four children, but both struggled with their addictions. In July 2012 Mr Rausing was stopped by police after driving erratically through morning rush hour traffic in Wandsworth, south London and arrested for possession of class A drugs. When they later raided his house, 48-year-old Mrs Rausing was so badly decomposed that she had to be identified from a fingerprint and the serial number on her heart pacemaker. Following Eva's death, Mr Rausing moved out of his Belgravia house to undergo a rehabilitation programme at a private clinic, living at the private hospital for two years. Ms Delves Broughton, who works for auctioneers Christie's at their London showroom, was there to support Rausing when he came out of the clinic and they became engaged in March while on holiday in Barbados. She is the younger sister of fashionista Isabella Blow, who took her own life in May 2007. Revellers: Actor and director Danny Huston (left) with author Simon Astaire (right) at last night's party to celebrate Mr Rausing's wedding . All smiles: Business tycoon and philanthropist Gerald Ronson, with his wife Dame Gail Ronson and author and conservationist Desmond Guinness smiled as they left the venue in London . Celebrations: Tory peer Lord Benjamin 'Beano' Mancroft with his wife Emma (left), and Sotheby's deputy chairman Lord Harry Dalmeny (right) Important role: Lord Teddy Derby, pictured right with his son and daughter, gave the bride away during the ceremony . Mr Rausing's wealth comes from the world's largest food packaging firm, Tetra Pak, which was founded in Sweden by his grandfather. Like several other members of the family, Mr Rausing settled in London. Private benefactor Mr Rausing, who has given tens of millions of pounds to charities including The HALO Trust – which removes land mines left behind in wars – museums and veterans' foundations, first met Ms Delves Broughton at Christies in 2002. He and Eva had gone to lunch at the auction house, where Ms Delves Broughton began working as a secretary 18 years ago. She quickly rose through the ranks, working in Old Masters, then the Valuation Department, before becoming a senior director working for Lord Linley in the Chairman's Office. They then met again in 2006 when Hans, a serious art collector, called Christie's in to make a valuation at his home in Belgravia. Their romance and his recovery have been compared with Victoria Getty rescuing her husband Sir Paul Getty from addiction and helping him to become one of Britain's greatest philanthropists. They married in July at Woburn Abbey in Bedfordshire, with the Earl of Derby giving her away and Detmar Blow, ex-husband of her late sister, among the small number of guests.

"New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio's approval rating took a major hit on Wednesday among the friends and family members of the 265 people who tragically lost their lives as a result of the crash of Flight 587. De Blasio, who is notoriously tardy, showed up 20 minutes late for the commemorative ceremony, missing the moment of silence and ringing of the bell that happens every year at 9:17am to mark the exact time the tragedy occurred on November 12, 2001. Making matters even worse, he blamed the fog for keeping him from arriving on time. Tardy: Mayor Bill De Blasio (above) showed up 20 minutes late to a ceremony commemorating those who lost their lives due to the crash of Flight 587 . Ringing the bell: De Blasio missed the annual moment of silence and ringing of the bell which happens every year at 9:17am, the exact moment the tragedy occurred . Grieving families: Those in attendance were incredibly upset that de Blasio arrived to the event so late, which he blamed on the fog . 'Mayor de Blasio traveled to the ceremony by boat this morning and the boat was delayed due to heavy fog,' a statement from the mayor's office said. 'The Mayor regrets missing the tolling of the bell, but was glad to have an opportunity to mark this solemn day with the families of those lost on Flight 587, who have the continued support of this administration.' Those at the ceremony were enraged, and let De Blasio know just that after he gave his remarks. Miriam Estrella, who lost 5 family members in the crash, said she confronted De Blasio, and that he 'didn't really apologize.' Letting him have it: After the ceremony, some of the family members and friends of the victim confronted the mayor . Lost lives:All 260 people on the plane and five on the ground were killed in the 2001 crash . Remembering: To mark the fifth anniversary a memorial was constructed to the victims (above) and each year the ceremony is held there . She also told DNA Info, 'Every year Mayor [Michael] Bloomberg is here on time ready to go. He’s here 30 minutes (before) socializing with the family members, giving us all the support.' 'And this year [Mayor Bill de Blasio] came a lot of minutes late. 9:16 is the time that our family members passed away. We’re supposed to toll the bell. We’re not supposed to wait for him to toll the bell.' Twitter user @KianaFaith was even more upset, writing, '13 years today w. Out my mother in my life , at the memorial && this fu**ing Duma** mayor bill de blasio , is showing up late . Kill urself.' De Blasio was scheduled to give remarks at 9:05am and arrived at 9:25am, almost 10 minutes after the moment of silence. This is not the first time De Blasio has been late for a major event, with this actually being the norm for the decreasingly popular politician. Later in the day, De Blasio elaborated on why he was late, saying, 'I just woke up in the middle of the night, couldn’t get back to sleep and felt really sluggish and off-kilter this morning.' Crash site: Flight 587 went down in the Belle Harbor neighborhood of Queens shortly after takeoff . The crash occurred exactly two months and one day after two planes hit and took down the Twin Towers . Very angry: A woman who lost her mother shared how upset she was on Twitter . Flight 587 was travelling from John F. Kennedy International Airport to Las Américas International Airport in the Dominican Republic when it crashed shortly after takeoff in the Belle Harbor neighborhood of Queens on November 12, 2001. All 260 people aboard were killed, along with five on the ground. The crash happened exactly two months and one day after the 9/11 tragedy. A memorial was constructed in Rockaway Park, Queens to commemorate the crash on its fifth anniversary, and every year a ceremony is held on November 12, with Mayor Bloomberg having attended every year until now when he served as the city's mayor - and never once arriving late.","New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio arrived 20 minutes late to a ceremony commemorating those who lost their lives on Flight 587 .

"Members of a Kansas community shattered by the double tragedy of two beloved high school classmates who committed suicide just two days apart gathered by the hundreds on Tuesday for a vigil meant both to celebrate the girls' lives and to urge others not to make that same choice. Soccer star at Olathe Northwest High Ciara Webb, 16, was found dead in her home Friday afternoon. Her teammate Cady Housh jumped in front of a freight train two days later. At Tuesday night's vigil, the girls' dear friends shared bittersweet tales of their teen hijinks in the glow of candlelight inside Grace United Methodist Church. Of course, the tragedy hit closest to home for the girls' family. Nevertheless, one of their grieving fathers took the opportunity to send a message to the friends Ciara and Cady left behind. Scroll down for video... Mourning: Hundreds gathered in an Olathe, Kansas church Tuesday night to mourn the deaths of two high school girls, both on the local high school's soccer team, who killed themselves two days apart over the weekend . A father's plea: Friends of Cady Housh and Ciara Webb shared fond memories of the girls as they held candles at the mournful vigil. A father of one of the victims pleaded with the kids to discuss their feelings with one another to try and prevent yet another tragedy . Shocked community: Olathe, Kansas high school juniors and soccer teammates Cady Housh (right) and Ciara Webb (left) committed suicide within just two days of each other over the weekend . Share your feelings with one another and help prevent this from ever happening again, he said, because even he even he couldn't see the signs of suicide in his daughter. Echoing the broken father's sentiment was Dr. Nanette Roberts of Grace United who counseled that anger can be a part of healing. 'They didn’t let us love them into better health, they didn’t let us love them into staying alive, they didn’t let us love them into staying alive. 'They didn’t let us love them into know how important they were and that leaves you feeling empty and yeah a little bit angry,' she told WDAF. Students at Olathe Northwest High who didn't already know of Ciara's tragedy over the weekend were horrified to hear the news Monday morning. During the following school period, officials dropped another bomb: Cady, a junior like Ciara, had thrown herself in front of a train two days after learning of her friend suicide. On Sunday, presumably just before her decision to step in front of a barreling locomotive in Lenexa, Kansas around 8pm, Cady posted what would be her final message to the world. Sad: Cady Housh tweeted this ominous message on Sunday, the very day she decided she, too, would end her own life . Tragic: Housh (left) threw herself in front of a train on Sunday, two days after her soccer teammate Ciara Webb (right) had taken her own life at her Olathe home . Tragedy struck at Olathe Northwest High after, within just two periods at the beginning of their day, students and teachers learned they'd lost two girls, both juniors, to suicide . 'Worst weekend of my f***ing life,' the teen wrote. She would then retweet a message of hope that a friend had posted, one that urged the mourning 'to hold on.' However, the emotional young woman would not be able to do so herself. Over the weekend, Webb's close friends and teammates on the Ravens girl's soccer team had posted notes of grief, confusion and terrible sadness on social media. Many also included photos of Ciara. The 16-year-old blonde--called CiCi by friends--looked like a perfectly well-adjusted teen. Friends began including a hashtag, #ripCW, with their prayers, remembrances and photos. Unfortunately, they'd soon need yet another somber hashtag. 'You dreaded going into the hallways,' ONW high student Katie MacDonald told the Kansas City Star. 'Class was fine, because I'm a freshman. But when you went into the hallways, that's when people that knew (the first victim) were there.' Reports from inside say that some teachers were even seen to burst into tears once the news broke. On Sunday, by which time most if not all of those who were close with Ciara had learned of her death, Cady Housh was seen by a freight train engineer in Lenexa. She was standing on the tracks in the locomotive's path. The engineer summoned authorities but could not stop the train. What could have caused it? Friends of the girls expressed their grief on social media, on the same sites that still show the beautiful, smiling faces of Cady and Ciara (left and right) Mourning: Friends were left stunned by the one-two-punch of the girls' suicides. The hashtag #ripCW cropped up on Twitter and Instagram soon after Ciara's suicide, only to be followed all too soon after Housh's death by the tag #ripCH . Lenexa police and first responders were called to the scene in the Kansas City suburb shortly after 8 p.m. Sunday. The girl was taken to a hospital and later died. Soon, the Olathe Northwest students and other friends of the girls in the area were adding #ripCH to their wrenching tweets and Instagram photos. Also blonde and with an undeniably charming smile, photos of Cady carry no hint of the deeply gruesome act she'd soon find herself driven to. 'This amazing family will forever be missing two very important pieces, we love you guys, rest easy babies #ripCW #ripCH,' tweeted a friend of the girls' Haley Kuehn, who would later write, 'This is a living hell. Dustin Edde, who identifies himself as Ciara's brother on Facebook, posted a heartbreaking message to the late teen on Facebook Saturday. 'Love you so much Cici, wish I could find a time machine if anyone has one let me use it please. RIP little sister,' he wrote. Dear ONW Families: . I wanted to follow up with all of our families related to the tragic information we have had to share with you regarding the suicides of two students here at ONW. First I want to share with you how the events unfolded here at ONW this morning, the action that we took immediately to support our students and staff, and most importantly , I want to leave you with a strong request that you have a very heartfelt conversation with your son or daughter this evening . As you are aware, we opened ONW yesterday to any students in need of support or just needing a place to go and be with friends after learning on Friday evening of the death of Ciara Webb. This morning we met with our staff at 7:30 to brief them on the incident from Friday. They were provided with resources for talking with and supporting students. Qualified counselors, social workers, school psychologists, school resource officers from ONW, other schools/community resources were available for students upon their request or if any adult noticed that a student was struggling. Each student was told in their first hour about the death of Ciara Webb. Devastated parents: Ciara Webb's father Jason Webb (left) posted a touching photo of himself to Facebook after his daughter's suicide, making it his profile picture . After the ONW administration was notified of the death of Cady Housh, we asked that staff share the new information with their second hour class. After that announcement many additional students sought out the support and counsel from our crisis team of qualified personnel. Students were told that they could call their parents. Many parents called to check their students out of school. Care was taken to ensure any student that was leaving campus had a parent with them or they were in direct contact with their parents. Many students have remained here at school, with classes continuing as planned and with staff and resources available to them throughout the day. We are in constant communication with those on the band trip in New York. Please know care and support is being provided to them as well! Here is my request for all parents for this afternoon or evening - please have a heartfelt conversation with your student about these tragedies and specifically about suicide. Have this conversation with your son or daughter tonight – you know them best. Ask them how they are feeling, be non-judgmental, and avoid any gossip related to details of the deaths or causes. Keep communication open and maintain high supervision and knowledge of their whereabouts. It will be vital that you are closely monitoring your student's social media accounts for messages being sent and received. Include in your conversations tonight these messages: . - Suicide is a horrible decision and is not an option. - There is nothing they could have done or said to change the outcome of these tragic deaths. - Emphasize that suicide is not the way to handle problems, no matter how big or how painful. - Help is available. Talk to a parent, a teacher, any trusted adult. - If they know of a friend that is struggling, let an adult know as soon as possible. ONW is here to support our students and our families in any way needed. Please do not hesitate to reach out to any of the administrators or staff. School will be in session tomorrow. ONW is a safe place for them to be – surrounded and supported by their teachers and friends that care deeply for each of them. Counseling and support will continue to be available for any students in need throughout the week. Again, please do not hesitate to call or email with any questions or concerns. We are one Raven Family! Gwen Poss, Principal . SOURCE: KCTV . U.S.: The National Suicide Prevention Hotline can provide help if you or someone you know is considering suicide.

"A fully-insured Wisconsin woman may soon have to file for bankruptcy after she suffered cardiac arrest and was taken, while unconscious, to an emergency room that wasn't in her healthcare network. Though Madison's St. Mary's Hospital was just three blocks away from where Megan Rothbauer was in September 2013 when she had a heart attack at just 29, it's not part of her Blue Cross-Blue Shield network. Now, as Rothbauer recovers from the 10 days she spent in a medically-induced coma and the other six days she spent in a cardiac unit, she must also contend with whether she'll ever recover from its $50,000 price tag. Scroll down for video . Megan Rothbauer was just 29 when her heart stopped beating last year in September and she had to be rushed to the hospital. Her life was saved but she's taken a massive hit to the wallet because of the hospital where paramedics chose to take her . Rothbauer was taken to St. Mary's, the closest hospital to where her heart stopped at Weir Minerals, where she works. That proximity, versus the Meriter Hospital 4/10 of a mile away, cost her $50,000--and it could have been even more . When a provider bills you for the difference between the provider’s charge and the allowed amount. For example, if the provider’s charge is $100 and the allowed amount is $70, the provider may bill you for the remaining $30. A preferred provider may not balance bill you for covered services. Balance billing is expressly permitted under the Affordable Care Act. Source: Healthcare.gov . What seems most pointedly absurd to Rothbauer, a project manager, is that she wasn't even able to stop the ambulance drivers as they rushed her to St. Mary's instead of her in-network Meriter Hospital up the road. Four tenths of a mile up the road, exactly, where her maximum co-pay would have been $1,500. 'I was in a coma. I couldn't very well wake up and say, ""Hey, take me to the next hospital."" It was the closet hospital to where I had my event, so naturally the ambulance took me there. No fault to them,' the now 30-year-old told WISCTV. But this is not to say that Blue Cross-Blue Shield paid nothing toward Rothbauer's care. The company says it paid its maximum for in-network care--$156,000 of the original $254,000 charged by St. Mary's. It's called balance billing and its 100 percent legal, even specifically allowed under the Obamacare. That left $98,000, which Rothbauer successfully negotiated down to $9,800. However, as WISCTV points out, that doesn't cover bills from specific doctors, for the ambulance, the therapist, etc. Now the fully-insured professional is stuck with a $50,000 bill because of some bad timing and a few blocks. Blue Cross Blue Shield says they've done their part by covering the maximum they'd cover for anyone and pointed to the prices at St. Mary's. St. Mary's says they've knocked off such a large amount from Rothbauer's bill that they don't plan to negotiate further. 'It's unfortunate that Meriter is in network and was only three blocks away from St. Mary's,' said Rothbauer, who is now desperately researching ways she might stave off bankruptcy and live the life she sees friends her age leading instead of grappling to get out of medical debt. Sick irony: Paramedics chose to take the quickest route to the nearest hospital--St. Mary's (left)--to save Rothbauer's life. A minute more in the ambulance to Meriter (right), though it could have meant life or death, would have meant a lifetime less of financial worries of healthcare costs .","Megan Rothbauer's heart stopped at work in September 2013 and she was taken to the nearest emergency room -- Madison's St. Mary's Hospital .
But St. Mary's is not in Rothbauer's Blue Cross-Blue Shield network -- nearby Meriter Hospital is, however .
A four-tenths of a mile difference has now cost Rothbauer $50,000 ."
"A soccer ball kicked into the crowd by Rod Stewart at his Las Vegas concert has bounced back at the singer in the form of a lawsuit. A 53-year-old Southern California man who says he has lingering injuries after his nose was broken by the ball has filed the suit. Mostafa Kashe's civil negligence complaint alleges that he didn't expect to be hit in the face by a ball kicked by the raspy-voiced British singer from the stage during a show at the Caesars Palace resort in October 2012. Scroll down for video . Soccer fan: Rod Stewart pictured performing at the Vina del Mar International Festival, Chile, this February - the lawsuit stems back to a ball incident at his Vegas concert in 2012 . Mostafa Kashe (pictured) filed the lawsuit . Representatives of Stewart, promoter AEG Live and Caesars Entertainment Corp. didn't immediately comment Wednesday on the lawsuit filed against them on Monday in Nevada's Clark County District Court. Michael Roth, of AEG Live, said his firm had not yet been served with the complaint. Kashe, an electrical engineer from Diamond Bar, California, seeks unspecified damages of at least $10,000 plus attorney fees. His attorney, Larry Weinsteen, said Kashe and his wife were big Stewart fans who traveled to Las Vegas primarily for the concert. The lawyer said his client was treated by a hotel medic and filed an injury report with Caesars before being left with 'substantial' injuries including an impaired sense of smell. Stewart is known for hits including 'Maggie May' and 'Tonight's the Night.' The 69-year-old London-born rocker also is a longtime soccer fan and club league player.

"Her name may be unfamiliar to some but Emily Skye's drive for a fitter, healthier and happier lifestyle is what's gained her a following of more than three million on social media. The Australian personal trainer, from the Gold Coast - southeastern Queensland, has about 70,000 girls worldwide following her clean eating and fitness program. But she's spoken to Daily Mail Australia to share her top tips for summer while also unveiling some of the most common health and fitness misconceptions. Scroll down for video . Emily Skye, an Australian personal trainer, is a former model who used to have terrible eating habits and rarely exercised . The 29-year-old turned her life around five years ago when she decided to make the switch to cleaner eating . Now the Gold Coast personal trainer has more than three million followers across social media . Australian fitness guru Emily Skye shares her top five tips for staying healthy this season: . 1) Plan ahead - prepare healthy meals the night before which will help prevent the urge to buy processed and unhealthy alternatives; . 2) Cut back on sugar - stay away from packaged foods and opt for veges, lean meats or nuts; . 3) Don't be afraid of full fats - the low fat option sold in supermarkets usually contains more salt, sugar and other chemicals; . 4) Choose meals with high protein - if you're out for a meal, go for the fish, chicken or beef with a side of salad or veges. Always ask for the sauce or topping to be served on the side; . 5) Limit your alcohol intake - stay away from pre-made alcoholic drinks and instead have a beverage with less sugar like a vodka with soda water and a squeeze of lime. A red or white wine every now and then is okay too. The 29-year-old wasn't always a fitness guru. The former model recalls her troubled days when she had terrible eating habits and very rarely exercised. This took a toll on her physical and mental health. Leaving the industry behind in search for happiness, she became intrigued in the latest 'fitspo' craze circulating social media. And it's been five years since she made the switch to a healthier lifestyle by exercising regularly and eating unprocessed, clean foods. Since then, she's never looked back. But unlike some diets, Ms Skye also enjoys eating desserts, carbohydrates and other fatty foods - without the guilt. She doesn't count calories because she knows her regular fitness regime and balanced diet is what keeps her in shape. 'When I was modelling, I thought all fats and carbs were the enemy but it's silly to cut them out because your body needs them,' she said. 'It's funny when people get surprised when they see me eating a desserts or chips. These are okay as long as you have a balanced diet and it's all done in moderation.' Ms Skye shares her healthy breakfast with her Instagram followers . The fitness guru's version of tabouli - made from cauliflower and chickpea . Ms Skye also likes to treat herself with a home-made chocolate avocado mousse . This summer Ms Skye encourages others to plan ahead of time and prepare their healthy meals the night before to help prevent the urge to buy processed fast foods the following day. 'It's also important to cut back on sugars and basically stay away from anything in a packet as a general rule of thumb,' she said. Other tips include steering clear of 'low-fat' products as Ms Skye says these usually contain a lot of salt, sugar or other chemicals. 'Also don't be afraid to go out for a meal when dieting,' she said. 'You can still enjoy a night out and choose meals that a high in protein like fish, chicken, beef, beans or anything with good fats with a side of salad or veges. But always ask for the sauce or topping to be served separately as restaurants tend to drench your meal in this stuff.' With the holiday season just around the corner, Ms Skye also urges party-goers to hold back on the alcohol. 'Stay away from the pre-made lolly drinks because it's better to have something with less sugar like a vodka with soda water and a squeeze of lime,' she said.

Ms Skye says she doesn't count calories because she knows her regular fitness regime and balanced diet is what keeps her in shape . For the personal trainer, her main goal is to reach out to more teenage girls worldwide to help them build their self confidence . Ms Skye says it's important to set goals but they must be realistic. 'It's good to have smaller goals along the way to help you reach your ultimate one,' she said. For the personal trainer, her main aim is to reach out to more teenage girls worldwide to help them build their confidence and learn to love themselves. 'I'm drawn to teens because that's when I was at my lowest point,' Ms Skye said. And she's already doing this by motivating and inspiring her followers through social media platforms. 'Since I became healthier and fitter, I almost feel like I've found life again,' she said. 'I feel set free and have a much more positive outlook so I want to share this with everyone.' FIB 1: EATING CARBS AT NIGHT WILL MAKE YOU FAT . FACT: 'Eating carbs at night won't make you fat, nor will it stop you losing fat. It all comes down to what you eat and how much you eat each day.' FIB 2: LONG, SLOW CARDIO SESSIONS ARE THE BEST FOR BURNING FAT . FACT: 'Weights and high intensity training for a shorter period of time is definitely the most effective way to burn fat. You'll burn fat for up to 24 hours after you finish training compared to only around an hour or two after slow cardio.' FIB 3: IF YOU WANT TO LOSE FAT – THEN EAT LESS . FACT: 'When it comes to getting your fat percentage down, you don't necessarily need to eat less. Sometimes you may even need to eat more!' Emily says what you eat is so much more important than how much you eat. Giving your body a good balance of nutrients is far more important than the size of your meals. FIB 4: EATING FAT WILL MAKE YOU FAT . FACT: 'Fat will not make you fat. Good fats give you energy, help rebuild cells and helps to produce hormones.' Emily advises that you should avoid consuming saturated fats (excluding coconut oil) and trans fats. 'Also avoid low fat foods as they are usually choc-full of sugar and chemicals.' FIB 5: WOMEN BULK UP IF THEY LIFT WEIGHTS . FACT: Weights shape and sculpt your body, whilst also burning fat and unless you're taking some serious supplements, they will never make you look masculine or bulky. According to Emily, it takes a lot of deliberate effort with your training and diet to get even close to bulking up, so unless you're trying to get bulky, you simply won't be able to. FIB 6: YOU NEED TO CRUNCH YOUR WAY TO ROCK HARD ABS . FACT:  'You can do all the abdominal work you like but if you don't eat clean and do full body exercises to remove the layer of fat that covers your abs, then you'll never achieve the desired definition.' FIB 7: STRENGTH TRAINING IS DANGEROUS . FACT: Whether you're strength training or doing cardio, all exercises are dangerous if they're not done correctly. As long as you learn proper technique strength training, it is completely safe and a really important part of any fitness plan. FIB 8: THE SCALES TELL ALL . FACT: The scales only tell you how much your total weight is, not how lean you are. So the best way to track progress is by how you look, how your clothes fit and by taking a measure of your total body fat. FIB 9: THE LONGER YOU SWEAT, THE BETTER YOU'LL GET . FACT:  'Overtraining can actually cause your body stress and it can even go into fight or flight mode which can cause it to store fat. Focusing on efficient workouts, good nutrition, adequate sleep and rest will give you the best shot at getting the best results.' FIB 10: YOU BURN MORE FAT ON AN EMPTY STOMACH . FACT: This is really a personal preference. A lot of people don't tend to train as vigorously when they have an empty stomach and tend to binge after training. Fuelling your body a few hours before exercising with nutritious food will have a much greater impact on your fat burning potential as you have more energy to push through your workout.","Emily Skye, 29, is a former model who used to have terrible eating habits and rarely exercised .

"Suspended Minnesota Vikings star Adrian Peterson faced new legal trouble on Thursday after Texas prosecutors in his child abuse case asked a court to order his arrest on a possible drug-related bond violation. Peterson, 29, who has been accused of injuring his four-year-old son while disciplining him with the thin end of a tree branch, allegedly told a drug-testing administrator on Wednesday he had smoked marijuana before submitting to a urinalysis test, court papers said.

A court date has not been set on the possible bail violation. Peterson's next scheduled court date is November 4. It is unclear when a judge would rule on the motion as prosecutors' request to have the current judge recused must be heard first. Peterson's attorney, Rusty Hardin, declined to comment until a judge is settled on in the case. The Vikings said in a statement they were aware of the allegation and 'will await the results of that hearing before having further comment.' Peterson was surrounded by media and even a 'wildcat' holding a 'Free AP' sign as he entered court . Minnesota Vikings running back Peterson goes through security at the Lee G. Alworth Building . The National Football League did not respond to a request for comment. Peterson was arrested and posted $15,000 (£9,300) bond on September 12 on a charge of injury to a child. He was later suspended indefinitely with pay by the Vikings until the matter is resolved. He has admitted using a switch, the thin end of a tree branch, to discipline his son, but said he was not trying to injure him. Peterson could be sentenced to up to two years in prison and fined $10,000 (£6,200) if convicted. The charge against Peterson came as the NFL faced public criticism for its handling of a spate of domestic violence cases among its players.

"The Dallas Cowboys stunned Super Bowl champions Seattle with a 30-23 win on Sunday to move to 5-1 and the top of the NFC East. While Dallas had made a positive start to the season, their victory in Seattle, their fifth consecutive win this year, was still a surprise given the Seahawks (3-2) had lost just once in their previous 18 home games. Meanwhile, Joe Flacco threw five touchdown passes, four of them in a remarkable first quarter, as the Baltimore Ravens crushed the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 48-17 on a day when the league's elite quarterbacks came up big.

Aaron Rodgers' third touchdown in Miami was a game-winner with three seconds left on the clock as the Green Bay Packers beat the Dolphins 27-24 in a thriller. In Seattle, the Seahawks' offense struggled against a Dallas defense that has been transformed from one of the worst in the league last season into a highly effective unit. Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson managed to complete only 14 of 28 passes, throwing for 126 yards, no touchdowns and one interception. Wilson's opposite number Tony Romo linked up for two touchdowns and threw for 250 yards in another accomplished display from the Cowboys quarterback. Dallas made sure of the win in the fourth quarter with some superb work from their offensive line, creating space for DeMarco Murray to exploit with a fine 15-yard touchdown run.

Andrew Quarless scored a touchdown with three seconds remaining in a 27-24 victory for the Packers . A Dan Bailey field goal from 31 yards wrapped up the deserved road win for Dallas who now believe they have everything in place for a run into the post-season. The Ravens move to 4-2 on the season after a one-sided victory in Tampa where Flacco took full advantage of a depleted Bucs secondary. Flacco found Torrey Smith with touchdown passes twice in the opening six minutes and the game was over as a contest when Flacco found Steve Smith on a 56-yard touchdown pass at the start of the second quarter for the Ravens' fifth touchdown in 16:03 minutes -- the fastest five-touchdown performance since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970. Flacco finished with 21 of 29 passes completed, throwing for 306 yards and the five scores as Lovie Smith's troubled Tampa Bay fell to 1-5. Tom Brady was on form as the New England Patriots beat the Buffalo Bills to move into first in the AFC East . Joe Flacco threw four touchdown passes in the first quarter as the Baltimore Ravens thrashed Tampa Bay . Early season talk about the decline of the New England Patriots and their quarterback looks a little premature after Bill Belichick's team took sole control of the AFC East, moving to 4-2, after their win at Buffalo. Brady sealed the victory with a 56-yard pass to Brandon LaFell, the wide receivers' second touchdown reception in the fourth quarter, and finished with 361 passing yards. Manning continues to close in on Brett Favre's record of 508 NFL career touchdowns with the Broncos quarterback now on 506. Manning found Julius Thomas twice for scores as he threw for 237 yards. Packers quarterback Rodgers showed his class throughout Green Bay's win at Miami but the Dolphins almost ran out winners after a spirited second-half display. Peyton Manning enjoyed a happy return to MetLife Stadium as Denver brushed aside the New York Jets . Miami quarterback Ryan Tannehill struggled in the first half, throwing two interceptions, but touchdowns from receiver Jarvis Landry, running back Lamar Miller and wide receiver Mike Wallace gave Miami a 24-17 lead. But a Mason Crosby field goal brought Green Bay in sight and some poor clock management from Miami allowed the Packers a chance with the final drive of the game which Rodgers accepted gleefully -- finding Andrew Quarless with a four-yard pass into the corner to win the game. Cincinnati kicker Mike Nugent missed a 36-yard field goal at the end of overtime as the Bengals tied 37-37 with the Carolina Panthers. Both teams had scored field goals in overtime. The San Diego Chargers, the AFC West leaders, won their fifth consecutive game, a 31-28 comeback triumph over Oakland, and the Arizona Cardinals stay in front in the NFC West by defeating the Washington Redskins 30-20. The Steelers have dominated Cleveland during the Ben Roethlisberger era but the Browns enjoyed just their second win over the Pittsburgh quarterback thanks to their running game. Ben Tate rushed for two touchdowns and Isaiah Crowell another as Cleveland ran out a 31-10 win over their rivals.","Cowboys move to 5-1 with win over Super Bowl champions in Seattle .

"Adrian Peterson looked relaxed  on Wednesday as he appeared in a Texas courtroom for the first time since being indicted on a felony child abuse charge last month. Peterson, who had wife Ashley Brown by his side, was present at Wednesday morning's hearing in Conroe during which his lawyer was able to secure an early court date for his case which means he could play again this season. The Minnesota Vikings running back wasn't asked to enter a plea, although his lawyer said he will eventually plead not guilty to the charge that carries a penalty of up to two years in prison. Scroll down for videos . Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson looked relaxed in a Texas courtroom on Wednesday . The Minnesota Vikings star's lawyer secured a December trial and kept  his NFL hopes alive this season . Peterson was surrounded by media and even a 'wildcat' holding a 'Free AP' sign as he entered court . Rusty Hardin, the NFL star's lawyer, secured a trial date of December 1 after arguing that his client was unable to work until the legal situation is resolved. He also argued that Peterson was ‘getting killed’ in the media and couldn't fight back outside the courtroom. Peterson exited a black Cadillac Escalade outside the courthouse and was asked what he expected during his appearance. 'I don't know. We shall see,' he said. He was accompanied by his wife Ashley - the couple have been on-and-off since college days and finally wed earlier this year - and attorney Hardin. Nearby was a person wearing a wildcat costume and holding a sign that said 'Free AP' in sparkling letters, prompting a chuckle from Hardin. Several women stood near the courthouse entrance shrieking and talking about how handsome Peterson looked after he entered the building. The 2012 MVP, who was put on paid leave by the Vikings under a special roster exemption from the NFL commissioner, is set to plead not guilty to the charges.

Peterson wasn't asked to enter a plea in court on Wednesday, but has previously said that he never intended to harm his four-year-old son by spanking him with a tree branch earlier this year in Montgomery County, north of Houston. If convicted, Peterson faces up to two years in prison and a £6,200 fine in a case that surfaced as the NFL grapples with several players facing domestic violence allegations. On Tuesday, Hardin had revealed that his client planned to plead not guilty. 'If the court asks for a plea tomorrow [and we do expect that to happen] it will very definitely be NOT guilty,' said Mary Flood, a spokesperson for Hardin. With 10,190 rushing yards to his name, Adrian Peterson faces an uncertain future in the NFL . She added that she hoped a trial date would be discussed at the 29-year-old's initial appearance at court, but said: 'We don't yet know how the court's docket is looking.' Wednesday's court appearance comes just days after Peterson posted a series of tweets criticizing the public for 'believing anything' following a shocking report on his previous antics and charity by the Minneapolis Star Tribune. The Minnesota Vikings running back wrote to his million followers: 'It's SAD how people these days will believe anything reported by media sources that don't take the time to be GREAT.' Despite the timing of his message - just hours after the report accused his charity of improperly using tens of thousands dollars worth of funds - he later added: 'Just in-general!'

"A young US State Department spokeswoman is responding to Monday night's self-set media fire by adding more fuel, insisting she wasn't wrong to say the Obama administration should help jihadis from the 'Islamic State' find jobs as a way to stop them from engaging in bloody terrorism. 'In the longer term – and this isn't specific to ISIL,' Marie Harf said Wednesday morning on MSNBC, 'military commanders, politicians of both parties, counter-terrorism experts all agree that if you're going to prevent terrorist groups from spreading to other places and getting more recruits, you have to look at the root causes that can lead people to extremism.' 'How do you get them to not pick up that AK-47?' she mused. 'You have to do all of it, you have to take them on militarily,' Harf allowed, 'but you have to look at things like governance, like opportunity, so these groups aren't able to get more people to their cause.' On Tuesday night she told a CNN audience that 'we cannot kill every terrorist around the world, nor should we try. How do you get at the root causes of this? It might be too nuanced an argument for some.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . DIG THE HOLE DEEPER: State Department No. 2 spokeswoman followed her jobs-for-jihadis gaffe by saying Wednesday morning that the government should 'look at the root causes that can lead people to extremism' ELITIST SNOB ON CAMERA TWO? Harf said the need to look at things like governance, like opportunity' in counterterrorism plans 'might be too nuanced an argument for some' UNDER THE BUS: President Obama hinted Wednesday that Harf is all wet, saying 'poverty alone doesn't cause somebody to become a terrorist, any more than poverty causes someone to become a criminal' Hatrf's astonishing double-down came after a Monday night turn on MSNBC in which she said the United States 'cannot win this war by killing them, we cannot kill our way out of this war.' Instead, she said, the administration should 'go after the root causes that leads people to join these groups' – including 'lack of opportunity for jobs.' On Fox News, Bush-era White House press secretary Dana Perino said Harf should stop talking. 'If a deputy spokesperson for the Department of State is the lead story for three days straight ... if the spokesman is the story, you've got the formula wrong,' Perino said during an afternoon broadcast. President Barack Obama seemed to undermine Harf's argument Wednesday afternoon, telling the White House's 'Countering Violent Extremism' conference that 'poverty alone doesn't cause somebody to become a terrorist, any more than poverty causes someone to become a criminal.' 'There are terrorists who come from extraordinarily wealthy backgrounds,' Obama said, 'like Osama bin Laden.' Harf's series of embarrassing gaffes is reinforcing charges from Republicans that the White House for papering over religious aspects of a mass-beheading of Coptic Christians by the ISIS terror army. JOBLESS JIHAD: Harf had insisted Monday night that a jobs program in the Middle East could stem the tide of ISIS . 'THEY WERE CHRISTIANS': Pope Francis mourned the loss of 21 Copts in Libya who were beheaded on video by ISIS terrorists . Video surfaced on Sunday showing Libyan ISIS sympathizers decapitating 21 Christians on a beach. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest issued a 192-word reaction condemning the brutal killings as 'despicable' and 'cowardly' but made no mention of the religion of the killers or their victims. The words 'Christian,' 'Islam' and 'Muslim.' were not included in Earnest's statement. The video itself was titled 'A Message Signed With Blood to the Nation of the Cross.' The slaughtered men, clad in orange jumpsuits reminiscent of Guantanamo Bay detainee garb, were described as 'crusaders.' One of the men was seen praying just moments before his throat was slit. The White House convened a conference with representatives from more than 60 countries on Tuesday on a subject it calls 'countering violent extremism.' Like Earnest's statement, administration officials connected with the event have studiously avoided any mention of radical Islam or its animosity toward Christians and Jews. 'We are not treating these people as part of a religion,' a senior administration official said Monday during a conference call with reporters. 'We're treating them as terrorists. We call them our enemies and we’ll be treating them as such.' World leaders outside of Washington have leapt to connect ISIS, the self-described Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, with a religious battle that pits Islamists against the world's other great religions. The 21 Copts, 'were killed simply for the fact that they were Christians,' Pope Francis said Monday at the Vatican, speaking in his native Spanish. MUSLIM VS. CHRISTIAN: The five-minute ISIS video released on Sunday was captioned: 'The people of the cross, followers of the hostile Egyptian church'; One of the terrorists (center) boasted that 'safety for you crusaders is something you can only wish for' IMPATIENCE IN CONGRESS: Republicans including New York Rep. Peter King are growing more frustrated with a White House that steadfastly refuses to frame the ISIS battle in religious terms . 'The blood of our Christian brothers and sisters is a testimony which cries out to be heard. It makes no difference whether they be Catholics, Orthodox, Copts or Protestants. They are Christians!' British Prime Minister David Cameron said he was 'appalled by the murder of Christians in Libya, a simply barbaric and inhumane act.' 'Our efforts to defeat the monstrosity of Islamist extremism must not waver.' A CNN/ORC poll found 57 per cent of Americans disapprove of how President Obama is handling the threat posed by ISIS. Even among Democrats, 46 per cent say America's battle with ISIS is going badly. Public approval of the administration's anti-ISIS efforts has slipped by 8 percentage points since September. Part of that slide may be due to the State Department's focus on what conservatives deride as 'hashtag diplomacy' – a program of pushback through social media designed to strip away ISIS's glamorous appeal to would-be jihadis. The New York Times reported Monday that State is engaged in a broad effort through its Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications to coordinate all the government's social media resources in response to nearly 100 Twitter accounts blasting pro-ISIS recruiting messages into the Internet's digital ether. 'We're getting beaten on volume, so the only way to compete is by aggregating, curating and amplifying existing content,' Under Secretary of State Richard Stengel told the Times. 'These guys aren't BuzzFeed,' Stengel said. 'They're not invincible in social media.' But the director fo the National Counterterrorism Center told a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing last week that 'the government is probably not the best platform to try to communicate with the set of actors who are potentially vulnerable to this kind of propaganda and this kind of recruitment.' 'We try to find ways to stimulate this kind of counternarrative, this kind of countermessaging, without having a U.S. government hand in it.'","Marie Harf, the State Department's no. 2 spokeswoman, said Monday night that 'lack of opportunity for jobs' in the Middle East should be US focus .
She refused to back down, saying the Obama administration is considering 'How do you get them to not pick up that AK-47?'
'How do you get at the root causes of this? It might be too nuanced an argument for some,' Harf insisted .
'Countering violent extremism' conference continues in Washington but the White House insists 'we are not treating these people as part of a religion'
Obama seemed to throw Harf under the bus, saying 'poverty alone doesn't cause somebody to become a terrorist'
'We cannot win this war by killing them, we cannot kill our way out of this war,' Harf had said Monday night of the ISIS terror army ."

"A state doctor has claimed that the mental condition of a 12-year-old girl accused of brutally stabbing a classmate to impress Slender Man has improved and she is fit to stand trial. Morgan Geyser was ordered to undergo mental health treatment in August after a psychologist testified that she was not fit to stand trial, claiming she saw and heard unicorns, Slender Man and Harry Potter's Voldemort. The girl, who had previously appeared disheveled and often rocked back and forth in court, looked more alert and had her hair back from her face during Wednesday's brief hearing. She is accused of stabbing a 12-year-old classmate 19 times with another friend, Anissa Weier, after they lured her into the woods in Waukesha following a sleepover on May 30. Scroll down for video . Fit to stand: Morgan Geyser, pictured in court in June, has been deemed fit to stand trial by a doctor. She is accused of stabbing a 12-year-old friend 19 times in May and leaving her for dead . On Wednesday, Judge Michael Bohren summarized the doctor's report, but he didn't act on it after defense attorney Anthony Cotton said he hadn't had a chance to discuss it with his client. Bohren told Cotton to talk to the girl and come back to court next Tuesday. Cotton, who declined comment after the hearing, had previously expressed concern about the girl's mental health and advocated for treatment. Court documents allege that the two girls had plotted to kill their classmate in an effort to curry favor with the fictional character Slender Man. Accused: Geyser, left, and her friend Anissa Weier, right, allegedly planned the stabbing for five months . Co-defendent: Weier, also pictured in court over the summer, has a competency hearing next month . The victim, Payton Leutner, who identified herself to ABC's 20/20 in September, was lured into the woods and stabbed in the chest, abdomen, legs and arms, allegedly by her two friends. Police revealed the girls had been plotting the attack for five months and initially intended to murder Payton in her sleep at Morgan's house but backed out at the last minute. They changed their plans and decided to kill her in a bathroom at a nearby park the next morning. Weier told police she knew there was a drain in the floor for the blood to go down. When they left for the park the next morning, Geyser hid the knife tucked away in her waistband. They planned to play hide and seek with the victim and then kill her when they were out of sight, in the trees. Victim: Payton Leutner, pictured on ABC in September, had stayed at a sleepover with her two friends the night before and was lured to a wooded area the next morning. She managed to crawl for help after the attack . The Slender Man is a fictional character prevalent on the internet after originating as a meme in 2009. The mythical creature is often depicted as an unnaturally tall, thin figure with a blank, featureless face, wearing a black suit. The character is said to have long, tentacle-like arms, which can be extended to capture prey. It is said to stalk, abduct and traumatize children and, depending on interpretations of the myth, can cause memory loss, insomnia and paranoia. It is also said to be able to create distortions in photographs and teleport. It is understood to have originated in a photoshop contest on the Something Awful Forums in 2009. It then went viral with numerous works of fan art and short scary stories published online known as 'creepypasta'. It was in the seclusion of the woods that one of the girls held down the victim while the other frantically stabbed their friend 19 times. Geyser told investigators she stabbed the victim multiple times, according to a criminal complaint. Weier said that the victim was so badly injured she couldn't breathe, see or walk and that they left her lying on the ground in a pool of blood. Despite her numerous wounds, she was able to crawl out of the woods and to safety where a bicyclist found her and called 911. The victim spent six days in the hospital. Doctors later told police the knife missed a major artery near her heart by a millimeter. The two young suspects were arrested several hours later at a furniture store where police found Weier had a five-inch blade in her backpack. Weier, who is now 13, has a competency hearing next month. She was initially found competent to stand trial but her attorneys objected to the findings. They have both been charged as adults with first-degree attempted homicide. Wisconsin law requires attempted murder cases with suspects from 10 and older to start in adult court before attorneys can ask a judge to move it to juvenile court. If they are convicted as adults, they could be sentenced up to 60 years in prison. If they are convicted as juveniles, they could be held until they are 25.","Morgan Geyser was deemed unfit to stand trial in August but a doctor said at a hearing on Wednesday that she has improved .

"A bizarre video has emerged that apparently showing a 'possessed' woman launching a crazed attack on a man on train in Canada. The clip was taken on an Edmonton Transit System train and posted on Thursday night on a Facebook account with the name Renee A. Carter. In the video - which was then featured on spoof website Break.com - a young woman is seen looking through her purse when she starts exhibiting strange and violent behaviour. Scroll down for video . This video of a 'possessed' woman apparently attacking a passenger on train in Edmonton, Canada, has emerged. She is shown grabbing her hair, and then trying to punch a man to her right . She grabs her hair and head before reaching out and grabbing the neck of the male passenger next to her. It appears the woman then strikes out at the man and yanks on his ponytail before making her way to the train doors. The video shows the man approaching her and shoving her several times and the woman kicks him, which leads to a struggle. The woman then falls onto the floor of the train as ETS security arrive at the scene and subdue both individuals. At one point, a voice off camera says: 'Hey, hey, hey, she's probably f*****g possessed.' Although it appears the video may be a hoax, officials with ETS confirm an incident took place. 'Unfortunately, the two individuals were involved in an altercation with each other,' Cheryl Oxford, a spokeswoman with the City of Edmonton told Global News. The two then get in a tussle (left) before security officers (right) intervene to break up the row . 'But luckily, our transit peace . officers were able to intervene quickly and appropriately, and both . individuals were removed from the train.' The . ETS says transit officers were doing their rounds at Churchill Station . when the incident occurred and were able to respond quickly. 'Safety . is our first priority,' Oxford told Global News. 'Our transit system is safe. As . you see on the video, the transit officers reacted quickly and . appropriately and were able to ensure the safety of the passengers as . soon as they were able to intervene.' 'Both of the individuals, as well as witnesses, were interviewed.' 'Based . on all the information that we were provided, at the end of the day, we . were able to determine that they could be released and they were issued . violation tickets for fighting in public.' 'Fighting on the transit is a rare occurrence,' Oxford added. Both people involved have been fined $500 for fighting in public, she said. A complaint was not passed on to Edmonton Police Service and the force says it is not investigating the incident at this time.","Clip was taken on an Edmonton Transit System train in Canada .

"After enduring months of noise and nuisance as Tesco expanded one of its stores, residents in the surrounding streets may have been hoping for a goodwill gesture. They got one… a free loaf of bread. The gift has infuriated locals in Toton, Nottingham, who have had to put up with work going on through the night and at weekends since July. Fed up: Aggrieved neighbours of this Tesco store in Toton, Nottingham, were given a loaf of bread each . Sarah Turner, who lives by the site, said: ‘The whole of the summer holiday has been destroyed. I and my neighbours have constantly complained about the noise. 'I and my neighbours have constantly complained about the levels of noise, meaning our children have been unable to sleep at night as the noise has gone on past 9.30pm. 'We have had every Sunday ruined for goodness knows how long due to their insistence of jet-washing vans all afternoon right up to my children’s bedtime. 'The list of complaints goes on and on. I’ve had a couple of gestures from Tesco in the past but I spoke to the manager and told him that he was alienating the very community they wanted walking through the doors. 'He told me that he was going to speak to PR about doing something for the community to compensate them in some way and this is where the loaf of bread comes in.” The neighbours received a loaf of tiger bread each - admittedly more pricey than that pictured . Neighbour Natalie Harvey, 37, added: ‘Most of the work happened through the night and at weekends. If the bread is meant to be building a relationship with the community, it is laughable.’ Mother of two Sacha Taylor-Jobbins, 32, said: ‘While the work has been taking place it has been terrible for parking. 'There has been a lot of workmen and a lot of heavy-duty vehicles around. 'We deserve more than a loaf of bread for everything that has happened.’ The store gave away 200 £1.30 loaves of its tiger bread. A spokesman said: ‘To celebrate the relaunch, we’re giving away loaves of bread and we hope that residents enjoy our great produce.

"Internet auction site eBay may only face a £500,000 fine despite one of the biggest cyber attacks experienced by British consumers. The penalty, which is the limit that can be imposed by the Information Commissioner's Office, would amount to just 2p for each of the 18million users in Britain and 0.00002 per cent of the company's global annual turnover. The email, home . addresses, passwords, phone numbers and birth dates of every eBay . account holder - 233 million worldwide -  are now in the hands of hackers who can pass them on to other criminals. A message on the eBay Inc homepage yesterday urged customers to change their passwords in the wake of one of the biggest cyber attacks in history . Customers were urged to change their . account details after the breach, but the site received another . technological setback overnight because of a dramatic increase in . traffic, meaning users could not change their passwords. Online purhcases make up  around one fifth of all credit card spends in the UK and consumers are expected to spend £107billion online this year. The British Information Commissioner's Office . said it was monitoring the situation and may be forced to investigate if British details are leaked, used and purchased by criminals. The body can hand out fines of up to £500,000 to bodies that breach the UK Data Protection Act. The most they have issued is £325,000, to Brighton & Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust, but also handed a £250,000 fine to Sony. Christopher Graham, the Information Commissioner, said: 'On the face of it, this is a very serious breach. 'What we can be sure about is that if there has been a breach of the UK data protection act, we’ll act firmly. 'This needs to be a wake-up call to all of us. It shows consumers the . importance of having different, strong passwords for different online . services. 'It’s a wake-up call to government that the 20-year-old data . protection laws are showing their age. 'But most of all it’s a wake up to . businesses. Cyber crime is real. Hacking is real. Responsible companies . have got to act to keep their customer information safe, and if they . don’t, they’ll find they’re not just in trouble with the Information . Commissioner, but they’re in trouble with customers too. The cyber attack on eBay took place in February and was undetected for around two months, giving hackers access to personal information and other non-financial data. Even though customers were asked to . reset their passwords, the breach gave intruders access to other . information, which is far harder to change. The company said it is trying to fix the problem and is sending millions of emails to customers in a bid to resolve the issue . Alan . Woodward, a cybersecurity expert from the University of Surrey said the . stolen data will already be available for purchase on the Black Market and will be sold for low prices. He said it will have been uploaded to 'dark corners' of the internet and customers will not be able to retrieve it. He told Mail Online: 'The personal details will now be on the Black Market and you will not be able to get it back. 'The . cyber-criminal market has become so widespread that information is very . cheap. You can now buy credit card details for pennies. 'Criminals can get someones name, address, date of birth, email and passwords for as little as £10. 'There have been so many hacks now that the market has depressed for the last two years.' He also urged customers to use strong passwords by shying away from words in the dictionary. 'That . is one of the techniques hackers use,' he added. 'When setting up an . account you have to ask yourself: ""Why do corporations need this data?"" 'For example, dates of birth are very valuable to cybercriminals, so lie.' Alastair . Paterson, the chief executive of Digital Shadows, a company . specialising in cyber security, said online criminals were advertising . 'teasers' containing names, date of births and phone numbers to . potential buyers, who could then purchase the rest of the data. Advocates of traditional high street shopping have seized on the data breach as a reason to favour bricks-and-mortar shopping. High Streets Minister Brandon Lewis said: 'The internet has revolutionised the way we shop, increasing choice and competition to the benefit of customers. 'Town centres need to adapt to survive – such as adopting “click and collect” services. 'But the cyber-attack on eBay reminds us of the need for internet security and for consumers to be careful about their passwords. This isn’t a problem that people have to think about when they shop on the high street'. What personal details were stolen? Hackers gained access to eBay customers' names, encrypted passwords, email addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers and dates of birth. It is unclear whether all, or any, of the details were taken but security experts are warning people to assume the worst. Are my credit cards details safe? The firm said that the infiltrated part of the network did not contain any financial details, so in theory, yes. Will changing my password solve the problem? Changing passwords will stop hackers from being able to use any login details that were stolen. However, they could still use names, addresses and birth dates to commit identity fraud. It’s a good idea to change passwords following any attack such as this. It’s also important to update login details on any sites that use the same password. If a hacker has your password and email address they could use it to attempt to access other sites that use the same combination. As a rule, the same password should never be used across different sites. Should I change my PayPal password as well? PayPal, which owns eBay, has confirmed its accounts and customers have not been affected by this cyber attack. However, as a matter of course, it’s good practice to change all related passwords across different sites, including PayPal. Which countries are affected? At the moment, we can assume that all eBay customers worldwide will be affected by this breach, until eBay says otherwise. Is this hack a result of the Heartbleed bug? When Heartbleed was exposed, eBay announced its customer’s account were secure and had not been affected. This suggests the latest hack is a separate attack. How did hackers steal the information? It is unclear how the hackers got hold of the information but eBay said it is working with forensic teams to get an answer to this question. Why did it take so long for eBay to inform customers of the breach? MailOnline has contacted eBay for an answer to this question. It is unclear what caused the delay. Typically, following cyber attacks, a firm will investigate the breach to try and determine how many people are affected, and the severity of the attack, before issuing advice.","Information Commissioner can issue fine for breaching data protection .

"Avram Grant is set to be confirmed as the new manager of Ghana on a two-year deal. Grant, the former Chelsea and West Ham manager, will reportedly land a hefty signing-on fee in the region of £130,000, in addition to £30,000-a-month wages. His agreement to take over at the Black Stars, who have been without a permanent manager following Kwesi Appiah’s departure in April, was in doubt over his nationality. Avram Grant, pictured at Wimbledon last year, is set to be unveiled as the new manager of Ghana . The Israeli could be refused access to some Northern African countries, but Ghana FA president Kwesi Nyantekyie believes the issue will be resolved. ‘The holder of an Israeli passport will not only be denied entry into North African countries, he will be denied into some Arab countries,’ Nyantekyie told BBC Sport. ‘He has brought an alternative way of dealing with it. There is a satisfactory arrangement to arrest his threat. Very soon, in a matter of months, we should clear that.’ Grant lead Chelsea to the Champions League final in Moscow in 2008 where they lost to Manchester United . Nyantekyie, who claimed an agreement will be in place for Grant to take over after Ghana’s match against Togo on Wednesday, added: ‘He is a motivator. He has the capacity and skill to manage egos and top players and these are some of the challenges that the Black Stars team is going through. ‘He has the strength, he has a strong mentality. He feels in Africa most of the players lack the passion or the mentality even though they have the skill. We hope he will be able to instil these qualities so that we will win trophies.’ Grant will lead Ghana in the Africa Cup of Nations in January . Grant, 59, took Chelsea to the Champions League final in 2008, where they lost to Manchester United, and also managed the Israel national team for four years. He will be charged with winning Ghana their fifth Africa Cup of Nations title in January.

During the 2011 struggles, he had . escaped from a prison and has now been accused of the 'premeditated . killing of officers, soldiers and prisoners'. Ousted: Former president Mohammed Morsi has been formally accused of a raft of crimes and is expected to be charged . Backing: Supporters of Egypt's ousted president Mohamed Morsi take part in a demonstration in the city of Alexandria, where at least five people died . The announcement by prosecutors of the . investigation against Morsi is likely to pave the way to a formal . indictment and eventually a trial. It was the first news of his legal . status since he was deposed by the military on July 3. Since then, the . Islamist leader has been held incommunicado in a secret location. Besides Morsi, five other senior figures from the group have been detained. Hassan Mohammed, a 30-year old teacher who came from southern Egypt to join the pro-Morsi rally, remained steadfast. 'Even . if we are going to die, me and my family, we won't leave this place . before our president comes back. Even if it takes seven years. We are . ready to be martyrs in the name of religion and the nation,' he said.","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"A six-year-old boy with a rare neurological condition has completed a triathlon thanks to an incredible show of love from his big brother. Lucas Aldrich, who is unable to walk or talk, was pulled in a dinghy, pushed in a wheelchair and tugged along by a bike driven his eight-year-old brother Noah at a children's triathlon last week. The boys, from Boise, Indiana, took part in the race after Noah said he wanted to complete it alongside his brother - his best friend. 'They definitely have a special bond, the . two of them,' their father, Brian, told KTVB. 'You see Lucas light up so much when Noah . enters the room. It just brings a smile to your face when you see the . love between the boys.' Show of strength: Noah Aldrich, 8, is pictured pulling his six-year-old brother Lucas during a triathlon . Noah said he loves going on walks and watching television with his little brother, who has a rare neurological condition called lissencephaly. 'I like everything about him, he's perfect,' Noah said. The family like to stay active and give Lucas the best experiences in life - from skiing to plane rides to trips to Disney World. Recently, they heard about a YMCA Kids Club Program - and a kids' triathlon. Noah said he wanted to get involved. 'He said, . ""Mom, I want to do this with my brother"",' their mother, Alissa, said. 'That's where the . idea was born and I think the next day we started training.' Fighter: Noah suggested competing in the race with his little brother, who has a rare neurological disorder . For three months, they trained in running - with Noah pushing Lucas in a large stroller - and swimming - with Lucas in a boat pulled along by Noah - and cycling, with Lucas in a stroller on the back of his brother's bike. The triathlon consisted of 200 meters swimming, three miles cycling and one mile running. On the big day, Noah admitted that he was nervous - but he put in an astonishing effort and carried his brother across the finish line as spectators cheered. They completed the race in just over 54 minutes, JRN reported. 'It was really exciting to watch them and . a little nerve wracking as parents, but they did so good and we're . proud of them,' Alissa said. Lucas was born with lissencephaly, which means he is missing the normal folds and wrinkles in the cerebral cortex, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. Best friends: Noah called his younger brother, who cannot walk or talk or eat on his own, 'perfect' It occurs in only one in 85,470 births and can cause seizures, difficulty swallowing and other serious health problems, as well as a shortened life span, according to The Cortical Foundation. Mrs Aldrich told Today.com that she had a normal pregnancy, but that Lucas started to cry for hours on end when he was three months old. He had an MRI, which revealed the disorder. 'He can't walk, he can't talk, but he’s the happiest little guy you can ever imagine and he just loves being around people,' she said. The family . have launched a non-profit organization called Lucas House, which helps . parents with special needs children and provides the kids with pet therapy, . music therapy and arts and crafts.

"The head of the IMF has refused to ‘go on my knees’ to apologise to George Osborne for wrongly warning his austerity cuts would harm the British economy. Christine Lagarde admitted ‘we got it wrong’ after the global financial watchdog warned the UK Chancellor he was ‘playing with fire’ by pressing ahead despite a sluggish recovery. Pressed repeatedly on whether she had apologised to Mr Osborne in person, Miss Lagarde admitted mistakes in growth forecasts but hit back: ‘Do I have to go on my knees and bend over backwards to say it?’ IMF chief Christine Lagarde has admitted getting it wrong on British growth, after urging Chancellor George Osborne to change course on the cuts . Last year, the International Monetary Fund caused a huge row when it claimed Government cuts were harming the prospects for the economy. It warned Britain was ‘still a long way from a strong and sustainable recovery’. Olivier Blanchard, chief economist at the IMF, said Mr Osborne was 'playing with fire' by pressing ahead with austerity before the recovery gathers pace. He added: 'In the face of weak demand it is really time to reconsider an adjustment to the fiscal consolidation plans.' But over the past year the economy has recovered and the IMF has since upgraded forecasts four times in a row. The IMF now expects growth of 2.9 per cent rate of growth in 2014, putting Britain on course to grow faster than any of the G7 richest countries, including the US, Germany and France. Appearing on BBC One’s Andrew Marr show, Miss Lagarde was pressed repeatedly on whether she had apologised to Mr Osborne for the IMF’s strident warnings which turned out to be wrong. ‘We said very clearly that we had underestimated growth for the UK and that we had, our forecasts, had been proven wrong by the reality of economic developments and I’m happy to repeat it for you.’ In April the International Monetary Fund was forced to admit the UK economy was on course to grow by 2.9 per cent this year, faster than any other G7 country . Miss Largarde admitted that Mr Osborne had faced intense pressure to change course after the IMF criticism, ‘but he resisted, as he would’. Asked several times if she had said sorry, she hit back: ‘I completely acknowledge that we underestimated growth. Now, do I have to go on my knees and bend over backwards to say it? ‘We got it wrong. We acknowledged it. We were not the only ones to get it wrong, we were in good company actually. ‘Most forecasters got it wrong, and clearly the confidence building that has resulted from the economic policies adopted by the government has surprised many of us.’ After being in the economic doldrums for many months, the UK economy is growing faster than most major economies – and crucially is not relying on consumer spending to fuel the boom. ‘It is growth is fuelled both by consumption but also now investment, but not just public investment as we recommended earlier on, but also with private investment,’ Miss Lagarde added. ‘Exports is lagging behind a little bit, but those two big cylinders of growth, consumption and investment, are fuelling growth, which in our view makes it more sustainable than if it was fuelled exclusively by consumption as was feared a few months back.’ She warned risks remained on low productivity and rising housing prices, but asked if there was a property boom in Britain, Miss Lagarde replied: ‘No. What our team has clearly seen and acknowledged is that the housing market in the UK is multi-faceted.’","International Monetary Fund last year warned cuts were 'playing with fire'

"A man has been refused an NHS operation to remove his excess skin after weight loss surgery -despite being so depressed he has tried to kill himself four times. Paul Thorn, who went from 30 to 11 stone following a gastric bypass operation, has been refused the operation. Instead the 30-year-old claims and has been told his issues with his appearance are 'all in his head'. Mr Thorn lost the weight following his operation on the NHS in 2007 and was initially happy with his appearance. Scroll down for video . Paul Thorn, 30, used to weigh 30 stone but lost 19 stone after gastric bypass surgery. He is upset he has been refused an operation to remove excess skin caused by the weight loss, which rubs, bleeds and leaves him unable to leave his house or have a relationship . The excess skin is so bad he has to lift it to use the toilet and tuck it into his trousers when he gets dressed, and has led him to attempt suicide four times this year, Mr Thorn says . Here he is pictured before (left) and after (right) the NHS gastric bypass operation in 2007 after which he lost 19 stone. Initially, he was happy with his appearance, but soon became so depressed by his excess skin . But the dramatic weight loss left him with unsightly excess skin which caused his self-esteem to plummet to an all-time low, leaving him too embarrassed to leave the house, get a job, or have an intimate relationship. Mr Thorn paid for a tummy tuck operation at a private clinic in Poland and the NHS later funded further procedures to remove excess skin from his thighs and chest. Mr Thorn hoped the NHS would fund a final operation to remove excess skin from his arms, bottom and pubic area. But despite numerous applications the NHS Aylesbury Vale, Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) have supported decisions to refuse the surgery made by the Individual Funding Request team, Clinical Triage Panel and Case Review Committee. They recently wrote to Mr Thorn to confirm their support of the decision not to fund an operation to remove his remaining excess skin citing a previous diagnosis of Body Dysmorphic Disorder - an imagined defect in appearance - as one of their reasons. But Mr Thorn said the issues with his appearance are far from imagined as his excess skin rubs, causing sores and bleeding. Losing weight will be the answer to many people's prayers. But they may not realise dramatic weight loss can have a deeply distressing side-effect: excess skin. This hidden downside of losing weight occurs as a result of damage to the deeper layers of skin, the dermis, which contains two proteins: elastin, which helps it retract, and collagen, for strength. When the skin is stretched too much through weight gain, these proteins tear and break, resulting in a loss of elasticity and strength. Unfortunately, while losing weight causes the fat cells to lose their fat, the skin cannot retract. It is linked unpleasant health problems, from infections to back pain. Doctors say the excess skin after weight loss is the same skin damage that occurs during pregnancy — but all over the body. Factors that affect how much skin is left include age, how quickly the weight was lost (gastric bands are slower than bypasses, for example), and, for women, the number of children she has had. Many patients patients develop an “apron” of skin around the abdomen, and loose skin under the arms, chest and inner thighs. This excess skin can cause a range of medical problems. One of the most common is intertrigo — a bacterial, fungal, or viral infection that occurs often due to the difficulty in keeping these folds of excess skin clean and dry. Patients also find the folds of skin make it difficult to exercise. Excess skin is a problem particularly for people who undergo bariatric (weight loss) surgery. He said it is so bad he has to lift it to use the toilet and tuck it into his trousers when he gets dressed. He said he has become so depressed by his excess skin and his fight to have it removed he had tried to commit suicide on four occasions in the last year alone. Mr Thorn said: 'It's not just the excess skin that's made me depressed but the fight to have it removed. 'I'm obviously happy to have lost the weight but being left with all this excess skin makes me feel as though I'm still fat. 'I'm still so self-conscious about my body I'm too embarrassed to let people see it. 'I'm too embarrassed to go swimming and I feel too embarrassed to meet a woman as I'm scared she'll be repulsed by my body. 'I'm only 30 but I feel like I have the body of an elderly man. 'The excess skin chafes, I get sores and have to use creams to soothe them. 'It gets in the way when I want to go to the toilet, sometimes I lose my testicles within all the skin, it is that bad.' In a letter to Mr Thorn following his appeal against their decision, the Aylesbury Vale Clinical Commissioning Group said Mr Thorn was physically healthy and they therefore did not see fit to alter the previous decision not to fund the operation to remove his excess skin. Despite Mr Thorn's claims surgery to remove his excess skin would prevent him from wanting to take his own life they said an application for surgery based on preventing suicide was not one they could accept. They added they could not demonstrate further surgery would improve his mental health, wellbeing social integration or improved self-image. The letter went on to cite a previous diagnosis of Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) and approved a referral for Mr Thorn to see a psychiatrist who specialises in BDD. But Mr Thorn said he was unhappy with their decision as it didn't take new evidence into consideration including a recent examination from psychiatrist Dr Jessica Gibson from Aylesbury Vale Mental Health Services, who said in her opinion he did not meet the criteria for BDD. In a letter to Mr Thorn and his GP, Dr Gibson wrote: 'Having examined Paul's excess skin today, it is my opinion that Paul does not have Body Dysmorphic Disorder. 'There is clear evidence of excessive skin on his arms, hip and buttock regions and pubic area. 'These have a significant impact on his self-esteem, confidence and most importantly his function. 'He needs to lift the excess skin in the pubic region in order to urinate. He believes it will prevent him from having an intimate relationship with a woman. 'I therefore do not believe that there is an imagined defect in appearance.' Mr Thorn hoped the NHS would fund a final operation to remove excess skin from his arms, bottom and pubic area. But the local CCG have refused his application, citing a previous diagnosis of Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) - where a person constantly imagines defects in their appearance . Mr Thorn said, he wishes he could afford the procedure himself but his confidence is so low he's unable to find work and no longer knows where to turn. He said: 'They have cited my mental health and suicide attempts as a reason not to fund the operation but it is the excess skin and the fight to have it removed which is causing the depression. 'Having this excess skin has left me with no confidence, I feel too embarrassed to go out or meet anyone. 'If I had the skin removed I'd have the confidence to go out to work and maybe meet a girlfriend. 'Without it I could live my life again. I don't want to lose my thirties like I have my twenties - fighting for this skin to be removed. 'If I was given funding for the operation I could go on to live a good life but until then I am suffering and will carry on suffering for the rest of my life.' A spokesperson for Aylesbury Vale CCG said: 'The CCG is aware of this case, but we do not discuss individual details. 'We can advise however, that aesthetic surgery for the removal of redundant skin after weight loss programmes or bariatric surgery will not normally be funded.' Aylesbury Vale Adult Mental Health Services added they could not comment on individual cases as it would breach patient confidentiality.

"These remarkable, vivid images are the winning entries in a competition set up to visualise research into Parkinson's disease. The charity Parkinson's UK invited British brain scientists to submit pictures captured in the course of their research to help 'create a full and vivid picture of Parkinson's research'. The winning entry, which shows green branches between nerve cells glowing like the filaments in a plasma globe, was titled Nerve Superhighway, by Rowan Orme, from the University of Keele. Nerve Superhighway: Rowan Orme's winning entry, which shows green branches called axons between nerve cells, which break down in individuals who are suffering from Parkinson's disease . Waterlilies: Nicola Drummond's bright pink, green and blue image of the build-up of protein that is thought to kill nerve cells and trigger the effects of Parkinson's, which won second place in the competition. The protein is called α–Synuclein, the University of Edinburgh scientist explained . Tangled Web: The third placed picture, by Joel Beevers of Oxford University, shows skin cells reprogrammed into stem cells and then grown into the types of brain cells that Parkinson's kills . 'The green branches between the nerve cells are axons,' he said. 'They act like superfast broadband connections, allowing millions of communications every second. 'These connections break down in Parkinson's.' The competition was open to researchers employed at a United Kingdom university, NHS Trust or other research institution. Parkinson's UK dedicated it to the memory of Jonathan Stevens, a scientist who died from the disease last year aged just 34. Dr Stevens was a prolific blogger, sharing both scientific writing and photography, and the charity called him on of its 'most creative research supporters'. Parkinson's is caused by the loss of nerve cells in the brain that produce the chemical dopamine, which helps to control mood and movement. Ocean: Nicola Drummond also submitted this shortlisted image. She said: 'The α–Synuclein protein, in red, has been captured in this image in an area of the brain called the cerebellum. Understanding how α–Synuclein clumps together, and causes nerve cells to die, will hopefully lead to the development of new treatments for Parkinson’s' Berry burst: Another entry from Nicola Drummond shows a close up of nerve cells in the brain. She said: 'The cells can be kept alive for several months allowing researchers to carry out lots of different tests. They want to work out why the pink α–Synuclein protein, which is normally harmless, clumps together in Parkinson’s, and how this event cascades into the death of nerve cells' The Odyssey: Hugo Fernandes, of the University of Oxford, said of his entry: 'These cells are at the start of a remarkable journey from skin cells to nerve cells. They can tell us a huge amount about what’s going wrong in the brains of people with Parkinson’s. This technique could be the answer to replacing the nerve cells that are lost in the condition' Every hour, someone in the UK is told they have Parkinson's. It affects 127,000 people in the UK - which is around one in 500 of the population. Parkinson's is a degenerative neurological condition, for which there currently is no cure. The main symptoms of the condition are tremor, slowness of movement and rigidity. Parkinson's UK is the UK's leading charity supporting those with the condition. Its mission is to find a cure and improve life for everyone affected by Parkinson's through cutting edge research, information, support and campaigning. There is no cure for the disease, but medication and brain stimulation can alleviate symptoms. First runner up in Parkinson's UK's competition went to Waterlilies by Nicola Drummond of Edinburgh University. The beauty of her bright pink, green and blue microscope image belies the deadly effect it depicts. It shows the build-up of protein that is thought to kill nerve cells, triggering the effects of Parkinson's. 'What looks like the pink flowers of waterlilies is actually a protein called α-Synuclein building up in the nerve cells of the brain,' she said. 'It is thought to play a major role in the death of nerve cells in Parkinson's.' Third place went to Joel Beevers of Oxford University for his so-called Tangled Web, which visualises one of the latest breakthroughs in Parkinson's research. Energise: Dr Amy Reeve, of Newcastle Universit, said of her entry: 'These are mitochondria, the batteries of our cells. Brain cells demand a lot of energy, so finding ways to keep these batteries working is a vital aspect of Parkinson’s research' Galaxy: Federico Zambon, of the University of Oxford, said of his entry: 'Nerve cells which produce a chemical called dopamine have been created from the skin cells of people with Parkinson’s. The green staining confirms the cells they’ve made are nerve cells, and the enzyme responsible for producing dopamine in the cellscan be seen in red' His deep red and pink image shows skin cells reprogrammed to become stem cells that can be grown into the same kind of nerve cells that Parkinson's destroys. Just last week scientists in Sweden said experiments using the technique on rats heralded a 'huge breakthrough' towards developing treatments for the disease. Mr Beevers said: 'Skin cells from people can be reprogrammed to turn into stem cells which can develop into almost any type of cell in your body. 'Here they're grown into the type of brain cells that die in Parkinson's.' Parkinson’s UK Research Director, Dr Arthur Roach, said of the winners: 'Beautiful images like ""Waterlillies"" would be at home in the Tate, but are in fact the product of tireless researchers working to unpick what’s going awry in the hundreds of millions of nerve cells to cause people to develop Parkinson’s. 'As well as being visually arresting, the images give us unique insights into how we could intervene and stop Parkinson’s, or even prevent the condition in the first place.' Brian Stevens, Jonathan Stevens’ father, who judged the entries with his family, said: 'Judging this extraordinarily complex research was a sheer privilege. 'Jonathan would be honoured that this competition was held in his memory. 'He was an avid supporter of Parkinson’s research, and communicating its progress to inspire other people with Parkinson’s.' Fireball: This second entry by Hugo Fernandes was also shortlisted. He said: 'What looks like an angry ball of fire is actually an image revealing the journey of adult skin cells being converted into neurons from Parkinson's patients in the lab. Once the nerve cells are created their potential as a tool in Parkinson’s research is huge' Purple haze: Heather Booth, of the University of Oxford, said: 'In Parkinson’s the nerve cells that produce dopamine die off in an area of the brain called the midbrain. No one knows why. This image is of midbrain nerve cells created in the lab, which will help to uncover this mystery'","Parkinson's UK invited brain scientists to submit images of their research .

"Iran has denied inspectors from the United Nations' nuclear watchdog access to a key military site - ratcheting up tensions between Tehran and the West and effectively ending a working dialogue. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors were turned away from a base in Parchin, south east of the capital, where intelligence suggests nuclear weapons could be in development. It led to the UN declaring a two-day meeting, intended to calm fears over the Islamic Republic's disputed nuclear programme, to be a 'failure'. And it said talks with Iran are now . unlikely to be re-started - as the West continues to step up sanctions . against the major oil producer. Key talks: Chief UN inspector Herman Nackaerts in Vienna before he made his way to Iran for the doomed two-day meeting . Nuclear: Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (left) visiting Natanz Uranium Enrichment Facility and British Foreign Secretary William Hague (right) who has urged Israel not to attack Iran . The aborted meeting came after Israel said it planned to deploy rocket interceptors from its 'Iron Dome' defence system in the Tel Aviv region from Monday. The technology, which is being incorporated into the 'heart of the Israeli military', served to fan speculation the nation is gearing up for conflict. On Saturday Iran docked two warships at a Syrian port, and Iranian bombers have been accused of targeting Israeli diplomats across the world. Israel has pointedly refused to rule out a military response, prompting British Foreign Secretary William Hague and the U.S. to warn such an offensive would have grave consequences for the entire region. Show of military might: One of the two Iranian warships which crossed the Suez Canal before docking at a Syrian port on Saturday in a move which will undoubtedly increase tensions in the volatile region . Moving forward: Iran has repeatedly denied it seeks nuclear arms and says its reactors are only for power and medical research . Mr Hague's rhetoric goaded Iran into . cutting off oil sales to British companies after he also accused the . Islamist regime of promoting terrorism. But the move will have little effect on British firms, which get well under one per cent of their oil from Iran since the European Union has already slapped sanctions on the country. The evolving conflict over Iran's nuclear programme is like a 'slow-motion Cuban missile crisis', a leading nuclear strategy expert has said. Graham Allison, from Harvard University, said each side has only murky intelligence, leading to tempers running high and the danger of a devastating outcome. He told MSNBC: 'As a student of history, I’m certainly conscious that when you have heated politics and incomplete control of events, it’s possible to stumble into a war.' Watching Iran, Israel and the United States, he said, 'you can see the parties, slowly but almost inexorably, moving to a collision.' International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors wanted to inspect a site at Parchin, southeast of the capital, where it believes there is a containment chamber. This, it understands, is used to text explosives and suggests that Iran is developing possible nuclear weapons - a charge that Iran denies. The Vienna-based IAEA said in a statement: 'During both the first and second round of discussions, the agency team requested access to the military site at Parchin. Iran did not grant permission for this visit to take place.' IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano added: 'It is disappointing Iran did not accept our request to visit Parchin. We engaged in a constructive spirit, but no agreement was reached.' Earlier, Iran's envoy to the IAEA, Ali Asghar Soltanieh, told the country's ISNA news agency Tehran expected to hold more talks with the UN agency, whose task it is to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons in the world. But Amano's spokeswoman, Gill Tudor, made clear no further meetings were planned and said: 'At this point in time there is no agreement on further discussions.' Iran rejects accusations that its nuclear programme is a covert bid to develop nuclear weapons, saying it is seeking to produce only electricity. But its refusal to curb sensitive atomic activities which can have both civilian and military purposes, and its track record of years of nuclear secrecy has drawn increasingly tough UN and separate U.S. and European measures. The U.S. and Israel have not ruled out using force against Iran if they conclude that diplomacy and sanctions will not stop it from developing a nuclear bomb. Future: Iran said in January it had produced the first nuclear fuel rod, and it had to find a way to make them because Western sanctions prohibit their purchase from foreign markets . In Washington, no immediate comment was available from the U.S. State Department on the IAEA statement. An IAEA report, published in November, suggested Iran had pursued military nuclear technology. It helped precipitate the latest rounds of sanctions by the European Union and U.S., which are causing economic hardship in Iran before a parliamentary election in March. The IAEA visit came as Iran last week announced 'key advancements in its nuclear programme' - inserting the first domestically made fuel rod into a research reactor in Tehran and installing a new generation of Iranian-made centrifuges at the country's main uranium enrichment facility in the central town of Natanz. America and its allies want Iran to halt uranium enrichment, which they believe could eventually lead to weapons-grade material and the production of nuclear weapons. Iran has been enriching uranium up to 20 per cent, while uranium enriched to more than 90 per cent can be used for a nuclear warhead. The IAEA team had wanted to talk to key Iranian scientists suspected of working on an alleged weapons programme. Iran has denied alleged weapons experiments for nearly four years, saying they are based on 'fabricated documents' provided by a 'few arrogant countries' - a phrase authorities in Iran often use to refer to the US and its western allies. The IAEA summarised its information last November in a 13-page document drawing on 1,000 pages of intelligence. It stated then for the first time that some of the alleged experiments can have no other purpose than developing nuclear weapons. One key finding was information that Iran had built a large containment chamber at Parchin in which to conduct high-explosives tests. The UN agency said there were 'strong indicators of possible weapon development'. The IAEA said intensive efforts had been made to reach agreement on a document 'facilitating the clarification of unresolved issues' in connection with Iran's nuclear programme. 'Unfortunately, agreement was not reached on this document,' it said in an unusually blunt statement. The IAEA mission's lack of progress may have an impact on the chance of any resumption of wider nuclear negotiations between Iran and the six world powers, the five permanent members of the Security Council plus Germany. The West last week expressed some optimism at the prospect of new talks, particularly after Iran sent a letter to EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton promising to bring 'new initiatives', without stating preconditions. But the U.S. and its allies may become more reluctant if they feel the Islamic state is unlikely to engage in substantive discussions about its nuclear activities. The deputy head of Iran's armed forces was quoted yesterday as saying Iran would take pre-emptive action against its enemies if it felt its national interests were endangered. 'Our strategy now is that if we feel our enemies want to endanger Iran's national interests, and want to decide to do that, we will act without waiting for their actions,' Mohammad Hejazi told the Fars news agency. In retaliation for oil sanctions, Iran, the world's fifth-largest crude exporter, has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, conduit for a third of the world's seaborne oil, while the United States signalled it would use force to keep it open. The White House has said there was still time for diplomacy. 'Israel and the United States share the same objective, which is to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon,' White House spokesman Jay Carney said when asked about a weekend visit to Israel by National Security Advisor Tom Donilon. 'There is time and space for diplomacy to work, for the effect of sanctions to result in a change of Iranian behaviour.'","International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors refused access to Parchin .

"Radical bid: The Prime Minister is intending to stop printing foreign-language paperwork . David Cameron plans to strip welfare handouts from immigrants who cannot speak English. In a radical bid to slash Britain’s benefits bill, the Prime Minister intends to stop printing welfare paperwork in foreign languages and prevent claimants using taxpayer-funded translators at benefits offices. The move – which would also hit British residents who cannot speak English – was due to be announced tomorrow, but has been delayed following a row with Nick Clegg. Tories hope that axeing foreign-language versions of documents explaining how to claim benefits would make it harder for immigrants such as newly arrived Romanians and Bulgarians to cash in on the UK’s benefits system, encourage others already here to learn English – and save money spent on translators. Referring to the controversial Channel 4 programme, one Conservative aide said: ‘The Benefits Street culture must end. Period.’ The plans were been drawn up by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith. One Tory insider said: ‘The vast majority of voters will think this idea is plain common sense. It is unreasonable to expect taxpayers to spend huge sums on translators when people should be learning to read and write English.’ Former Tory Cabinet Minister Liam Fox also gave the scheme the thumbs-up, saying: ‘The principle is a good one but it needs to be introduced in a way that’s fair and reasonable. If it is, it will meet with general public approval. The ability to speak English is one of the most empowering tools in the labour market and we should be encouraging as many people as possible to learn it.’ The announcement of the changes was delayed after a behind-the-scenes dispute between the Coalition partners – just the latest in a series of clashes between Mr Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Mr Clegg. Communicating: Immigrants getting help from civil servants in Newcastle . But Tory sources say they are ‘optimistic’ the changes will be confirmed later this week if the Lib Dems can be won over. One official involved in the plan said: ‘Cameron and Duncan Smith are very enthusiastic about it, but the Lib Dems had a wobble. They are nervous of being portrayed as being too harsh on immigrants.’ Labour’s Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons’ home affairs committee, also expressed reservations saying: ‘In principle, it is a good idea, but it could cost the taxpayer more because if people are refused benefit and have a genuine claim, they will sue the Government.’ At present the inability of claimants to speak or write English is no bar to them obtaining benefits. Translation services are available in all Jobcentres while local councils provide information leaflets in dozens of different languages. Latest figures show the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) spends £5 million on language services a year. The vast majority, £4.5 million, is spent on face-to-face and telephone help, with £415,000 more on ‘document translation’. Scrapped: A multilingual form used by Tower Hamlets borough council . The DWP used interpreters 271,695 times in the space of one year to assist foreign claimants, statistics released under the Freedom of Information Act show. Most of the money is paid to The Big Word, Britain’s biggest language services firm, which received £3.5 million in public money during 2011. Benefits offices deal with more than 140 languages, including Icelandic and Vietnamese as well as the more common Polish, Czech, Slovak, Urdu and Gujarati. Town halls such as Tower Hamlets in East London publish guides on how to claim benefits in foreign  languages which would be paid for separately to the DWP figures. In most cases, a claimant at a Jobcentre would be put on the phone to an interpreter at a call centre to help them complete forms. The service receives up to 22,000 calls a month and is usually able to provide an interpreter within 60 seconds. There is also a service for face-to-face meetings, used 13,000 times a year. Anger: One Conservative aide said the 'Benefits Street culture needs to end', referring to the recent documentary on Channel 4 . Tories and Lib Dems have fallen out over several immigration and welfare issues. In October, Home Secretary Theresa May was forced to scrap sending vans with signs telling illegal immigrants to go home to areas with large ethnic populations. The two parties are at odds over Mrs May’s plan to cut annual immigration from the EU to 75,000 a year. And they disagree over whether immigrants make the UK better or worse off. Mr Clegg has denounced Chancellor George Osborne’s pledge to slash another £10 billion from the welfare budget. And the Lib Dem leader vetoed a move by Mr Cameron to scrap housing benefit for under 25s. Taking advantage: The new guidelines will make it harder for immigrants such as newly arrived Romanians and Bulgarians (pictured boarding coaches to the UK) to cash in on the benefits system . The latest proposed crackdown reflects the influence of Australian-born Tory election chief Lynton Crosby. Mr Crosby is said to have given orders that the party must produce ‘a new policy to curb immigrants and benefits’ every week. Growing public pressure for a tougher approach to curb the UK’s ‘handout culture’, as highlighted on Channel 4’s Benefits Street series, is reflected in a policy switch Labour is set to announce this week. Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Rachel Reeves is expected to say that welfare handouts should be linked more closely to how much people have paid into the system. It could lead to higher payments for most adults, but lower payments to under-25s.","Prime Minister intends to stop printing paperwork in foreign languages .

"A man was brutally beaten by three men in the Angel Stadium parking lot after an important play-off match. The 43-year-old man and his relative were walking to a car after the Los Angeles Angels' game against the Kansas City Royals on Friday night when they were attacked in an unprovoked assault. Witnesses alerted Anaheim police officers of the incident and they found the victim unconscious. He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was said to be in a critical condition. The male relative was not injured. Kansas City Royals won the three-game series against Los Angeles Angels 8-3 to mark a return to the American League Championship series - but after Friday's match a fan was brutally beaten in the parking lot . Anaheim police Lieutenant Bob Dunn said: 'There is no evidence to suggest there was an argument or any type of physical altercation prior to the incident in the parking lot.' He added that there was no indication to suggest the attack was anything to do with team rivalries. Angels' spokesman Tim Mead said no extra security at the stadium was planned. 'Our response was immediate,' Mr Mead said. 'We are very confident with our security out there...it's not a rivalry (issue) at all.' Lt Dunn said the Anaheim Police Department increased the presence of police officers during the post-season. 'At this particular event, there was an increased staffing – above and beyond what we would deploy at a regular-season game', he said. In the three game series, the Kansas City Royals beat the Angels' 8-3 to mark a return to the American League Championship Series. The 43-year-old man was beaten by three men in the parking lot outside the Angel Stadium, in Anaheim . The victim and his relative were walking to a car in the parking lot after the match when they were attacked . This is not the first time an attack has taken place at Angel Stadium. In June 2009, an off-duty Anaheim police officer shot 23-year-old Carlos Velasquez in the Angel Stadium parking lot during a fight. Mr Velasquez, who was left partially paralysed, died two years later. His brother, Jose Velasquez, who was also involved in the fight, was also shot. The officer was cleared of any wrongdoing. The Angel Stadium, in Anaheim, California, is located 30 miles south of the Dodger Stadium, home of the Los Angeles Dodgers, where a San Francisco Giants fan was beaten in 2011 after a game between the rival teams. Bryan Stow, a paramedic from Northern California, spent months in a medically induced coma after being punched in the head, kicked and slammed to the ground outside Dodger Stadium. He suffered brain damage from the beating and was left permanently disabled. The violence led to a scrutiny of stadium security and fan behavior.","Man beaten after Los Angeles Angels and Kansas City Royals match .

"A sexy workout class aimed at women over the age of 18 has been revamped and is being marketed at female high school students aged 13 and up. The female-only Vixen Workout, the brainchild of former Miami Heat cheerleader Janet Jones, has previously only been available to adults because of its overtly sexual content and potty-mouthed playlists. But due to popular demand, Vixen Workout's trainers have created a special toned-down version of the popular dance class which is suitable for girls aged between 13 and 18. And according to the workout's website, the PG-13 classes will offer the same liberating experience, 'minus the #%$&@'. All the fun, minus the #%$&@: The PG-13 workout will encourage the same fun-filled, female-focused workout but without any rude language . Become your inner star: The class encourages girls to embrace their alter-ego and abandon all their responsibilities, even if it's just for an hour . Thus far the classes have proven incredibly popular with young teens eager to get a slice of the Vixen lifestyle, which is aimed at encourage women to let loose, forget their responsibilities and have fun, even if it's just for the hour that they are in the class. 'The main reason I was excited for this PG-13 Vixen Class was because now my friends are going to feel how I felt when I went to Vixen,' Manolie, a 15-year-old ambassador for the brand, told Racked.com. 'They are going to feel confident and good about themselves. 'For me it's important that every teen who goes to this class feels this way, because I know what it's like to feel bad about yourself and to feel unconfident. I can't wait for whats in store for PG-13 Vixen!' According to Ms Jones, who first started the classes when she was laid off from her corporate job in 2012, the classes provide a haven for women who are in need of an escape - and that same philosophy applies no matter what age the participant. 'Each Vixen Workout creates a fun club atmosphere where women can let loose, forget responsibilities, and transform into their “alter-ego” or as we say “getting your Beyonce, Ciara, Rihanna on”,' the Vixen website says. '[The classes] give women a safe haven to be a little rebellious with no judgments while working out, and having the ultimate ME time.' 'They give women a safe haven': Girls get the chance to enjoy the 'ultimate ME time' during the class . 'Damn I look good': Participants are told to doll themselves up for the class and feel as positive about themselves as possible by embracing their 'inner Beyonce (L) or Rihanna (R) Women who take part in the classes are told to wear make-up and dress up for the classes - rather than just wearing a tatty old t-shirt as many people do while working out. 'Unlike other workouts, we want you to get dolled up to sweat it all off an hour later,' the website adds. 'We want you to look in that mirror and confidently scream out ""Damn, I look good!""' While the classes are currently only being offered at the Vixen Workout studios in Miami, it looks as though the incredible success of the PG-13 program could lead to it being rolled out across their other US bases soon.","The sexy dance class has previously been restricted to women over the age of 18 who want to 'let loose and forget their responsibilities'

"Kremlin agents have contacted American parents trying to overturn the adoption of their 'mentally ill' Russian children, a court heard today. Judge Edward McCarty accused Moscow of attempted 'intimidation' as he revealed the New York parents had been contacted by Russian representatives. Their lawyer revealed that the parents in the case had been left in a 'state of fright' when they received the call on their unlisted phone number. The judge also disclosed that he had been contacted by the Russians. He said he would 'not be intimidated' and that Russia should respect international law and stop sending him letters. Banned: Judge McCarty, the surrogate justice for Nassau County also made what is thought to be an unprecedented ruling banning any adoptions under his jurisdiction that have been arranged over the Internet. Case: A Long Island couple has asked a judge to void the adoption of their Russian-born children because they suffer from serious mental disorders. Russia's children's rights commissioner Pavel Astakhov a key aide to Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin. He told Moscow's diplomats to demand access to two Russian children adopted in the US whose parents want to overturn the adoption, claiming the boy and girl are mentally ill. The case now threatens to blow up into a diplomatic row at a time when relations between Russia and the US are already at a historic low - although there were some signs of a thaw between the two country's presidents this week. Russia's Children's Rights Commissioner Pavel Astakhov has already called the parents ‘despicable’ and ‘mentally ill’ - and today one of the lawyers demanded that he be more ‘temperate’ in his comments. At the hearing Judge McCarty, the surrogate justice for Nassau County also made what is thought to be an unprecedented ruling banning any adoptions under his jurisdiction that have been arranged over the Internet. He hit out during the case of a mother and father who want to void their adoption of two girls from Russia in 2008 via major American adoption agencies Cradle of Hope and Spence-Chapin. They claim they were victims of a ‘bait and switch’ scheme because the children later developed severe mental health problems which they were never told about which got so bad the youngsters threatened to kill them. They also claim that the children they ended up with might not even be the ones the originally asked for and may have been sexually abused. The children, now 12 and 14, are currently in a New York state facility. They were not identified in court and were referred to as ‘Child A’ and ‘Child C’ whilst the parents were known as ‘PF’ and PM’. Today Judge McCarty made public a letter sent last month by the Consulate General of the Russian Federation in New York in which he demanded ‘detailed information on the case’. The letter, signed by consul general Igor Golubovskiy, said that he had been contacted by the Russian embassy to the US in Washington and that they wanted updates too. In his reply letter, which he also made public, Judge McCarty refused to hand over any documents and asked that they come to court like everyone else - a representative of the Russian Federation was said to be at the latest hearing although they did not identify themselves. Team: Peter Kelly, the lawyer for the siblings, is among the legal representatives in court today in Nassau County . Venue: Nassau County's surrgate court sat at the county court house in Mineola, Long Island, New York today . Chill to relations: Vladimir Putin and Barack Obama appeared to be on better terms when they met in Beijing this week at a summit for Asia-Pacific leaders but the judge's comments suggest tensions between the Kremlin and the USA . He also told Mr Golubovskiy that he is ‘fully familiar’ with international law and points out that he has ‘served in various capacities in American Embassies in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Albania, Slovenia and Haiti’. Furthermore, he adds, he ‘attended the World Court and the International Criminal Court at The Hague.’ Judge McCarty signs off by telling the Russian consul general that only when the case is over will he be prepared to discuss the matter further. MailOnline first disclosed that Vladimir Putin's children's commissioner had weighed into the row over the children on 30 October. Pavel Astakhov called for immediate access to the children and said he had asked Russia's diplomats to intervene. 'They remain two underage citizens of Russian Federation,' he said. 'They are protected by our laws. The Russian consul has a right to meet them, to access them. This is what must be done right now - to get access to these children. 'This is what the Russian Consulate in New York must be occupied with now - to meet and chat with them. 'There is little chance to bring them back to Russia. The Americans will not give them away. The children can go back only when they reach the right age and make such a decision.' Astakhov also accused the parents of 'covering their inconsistency by blaming the poor children, who have already been placed in a psychiatric clinic. This is despicable'. He claimed the children have been labelled and are imprisoned in mental institutions. 'This is deceit,' he said. 'They want not merely to surrender the children, they are seeking to cancel adoption, alleging the children's diagnoses were somehow concealed from them,' said Astakov. 'This is utter nonsense,' he said. 'The American couple had a complete dossier on each child and had the right to consult any doctor. They could have sought additional medical opinions if they had wished.' In a long statement to the court the judge then explained the extent of Russia’s tampering in the case. He said: ‘This court has learned that there have been contacts by a representative of the Russian Federation with the petitioners in regard to this matter. These contacts have left these adoptive parents in a state of fright. ‘Conduct by the Russian Federation has affected this litigation....inadvertent or intentional Russian Federation conduct will not intimidate this court, judge or litigants to bar public knowledge to the sensitive issues presented in this matter. ‘Under International Law any contact between the Russian Federation diplomatic corps and local political institutions is inappropriate. Any such contacts should be through the United States Department of State. The Russian Federation cites International Law in their letter to this court and I urge them to follow it’. The parents were not in court but were represented by their attorney Thomas Rice who said that Russia was trying to be an ‘interloper’. He described the case as an 'entirely tragic situation' and said the mother and father they were going through 'indescribable pain'. Mr Rice said that the Russian adoption agencies, who he called 'agents of the Russian Federation', were able to identify his clients and get their unlisted telephone number to their total shock. He said that as a result their privacy had been 'violated' and that they were 'subject to intimidation and fear by the breach of confidentiality'. Referring to his description of his clients as by the Russians as of as 'despicable', Mr Rice said: ‘I would request that the Russian Minister of state for children be more temperate in his comments'. The case has provoked a debate in the US and strong criticism of the parents by some, but Mr Rice said this was 'scurrilous' and 'disrespectful' with no basis in reality. Judge McCarty also praised the parents and said there was ‘not an iota of proof’ that they had victimized the girls. He passed his law banning internet adoptions in Nassau County because he said he believes the process is so unregulated it amounts to ‘human trafficking’. His ruling bans any adoptions organised through the Web or via any ‘unofficial adoption programme’ that is not affiliated to the state. Those who disobey it could be fined or thrown in jail for contempt. Judge McCarty said: ‘Today marks a court attempt to regulate the rehoming / unofficial adoptive trade in adoptive children. Correspondence: The official letter from the Russian consul-general in New York. But the country's agents also contacted the parents in the case on their unlisted telephone number . Robust reply: The judge's response to the consul-general. He warned Russian authorities today that he would not be intimidated . Banning order: Judge McCarty has forbidden any adoptions via the internet going ahead in Nassau County in this order, published today . ‘This is a first step. I urge other state adoption courts as well as state legislators and federal legislators to take suitable actions to regulate this aspect of the adoption process.’ Judge McCarty adjourned the case until December when he will decide if he will continue to hear it in open court. Most adoption cases are held in private. He said he feels that the ‘integrity of the American adoption agencies...has been called into question’ and the allegations of fraud claimed by the parents were so ‘disturbing’ they should be heard in public. Mr Rice, Peter Kelly, the lawyer for the children, the adoption agencies and Nassau County social services all want it held behind closed doors. Mr Kelly told the court that earlier in the day he had visited the girls at their facility and that he was ‘satisfied’ they were being looked after properly. Last year Russian President Vladimir Putin banned Americans from adopting Russian children in what was seen as a return of Cold War style diplomatic tit for tat. Before that, in the past 30 years some 60,000 children had been adopted by Americans from Russia as part of an industry worth $330 million.","Unnamed parents are trying to overturn adoption of two Russian children because they say they were misled and children are 'mentally ill'

"Veteran TV news anchor Bree Walker has been arrested on suspicion of drink-driving in Orange County, California, after police pulled her over in the early hours of Wednesday morning. The 61-year-old radio talk show host and disability rights activist was described as looking disheveled and smelling of alcohol by the officers who stopped her. The former CBS News anchor was stopped at 12.30am after allegedly failing to stop at a red traffic light. Scroll Down for Video . Arrest: Bree Walker was booked on a misdemeanor charge after allegedly failing a roadside sobriety test . She failed a roadside sobriety test and was booked for a misdemeanor DUI charge, before being released a few hours later, according to TMZ. Walker allegedly was unable to provide a driver's license to police and declined to take a breathalyzer test. She was taken to a police station for a blood alcohol test, Lieutenant Tim Schmidt told the OC Register. The results of the test are not available. Walker, who worked as a news anchor in California and New York City, had her pet pit bull in the car with her at the time. The dog, named Petey, was put in the care of animal control during Walker's arrest. Popular: Walker had a high-profile career as a news anchor and is known for being a disability rights activist . Walker checked herself into rehab for alcohol abuse five years ago. Then in December 2012 it was reported that she had sadly fallen firmly off the wagon and had been spotted drinking regularly - over a period of months - at the Roosterfish bar, near her home in Venice, California. An eyewitness at the time described Walker as 'way off the wagon' and said she had been regularly seen acting ‘very boisterous and loud, and throwing her legs up on the bar’ and knocking back shots in the bar. ‘Bree got to the bar around 11:30 pm and stayed right up until it closed at 1:45 am, she was knocking the shots back at an impressive pace,’ the source told RadarOnline.com. Walker was described as ‘unsteady’ on her feet when she departed and left behind her black jacket . . Walker has a rare genetic condition which results in her fingers and toes being fused together so they look like claws . Bree Walker, left, in a recent reality show called My Unique Family, and right, in her early days as a TV anchor in the early 1980s . When Walker checked into rehab for . alcoholism in February 2007, she released a statement confessing to her . battle with the bottle and pledging to overcome it. ‘As part of a continuing series of positive steps for unity, which have been taken in my family this past year, I have chosen, of my own accord, to enter a treatment program for alcohol dependency,’ she said. Walker, who has been married three time and has two children, is also known as a disability rights advocate. She has a rare genetic condition - inherited ectrodactyly - which causes missing fingers and toes, and also has syndactyly, which results in her fingers and toes being fused together so they look like claws. She gained fame as the first news anchor with the rare condition when she decided to go public with it after she had established her career at the ABC affiliate KGTV Channel 10 in San Diego. As an actor, Walker has appeared in TV shows including Carnivàle and Nip/Tuck, in both instances as someone who has ectrodactyly . Previously she had kept her deformed hands hidden inside a pair of glove-like prosthetic hands. Her television career started in 1980 at KGTV as a consumer advocacy reporter.

"Tortured: Abdel Hakim Belhadj said he was hung from a wall and kept in isolation . Damning claims have emerged that Britain helped send a terror suspect into the bloody hands of Colonel Gaddafi. A secret letter found in an abandoned . Libyan government building appears to show that MI6 provided . intelligence which led to the ‘rendition’ of a Libyan dissident who was . then tortured horrifically. Abdel Hakim Belhadj, who by a bitter . irony is now a senior military commander in the rebel army, last night . claimed British agents were among the first to question him in Tripoli, . adding that he was very ‘surprised that the British got involved in what . was a very painful period in my life’. He said: ‘I wasn’t allowed a bath for . three years and I didn’t see the sun for one year. 'They hung me from . the wall and kept me in an isolation cell. I was regularly tortured.’ Astonishingly, the letter’s author . appears desperate to take credit for Britain’s role, and fawning in his . attitude to Musa Kusa, Gaddafi’s intelligence chief who was known as the . regime’s ‘envoy of death’. He writes: ‘This was the least we . could do for you and for Libya to demonstrate the remarkable . relationship we have built over recent years.’ The letter lays bare the startlingly . close relationship between British spies and senior figures in the . Gaddafi regime, and raises serious questions about whether the UK helped . in one of the most controversial elements of the U.S. ‘war on terror’ – . the illegal movement of prisoners around the world. The explosive letter was among . hundreds of documents found abandoned by campaign group Human Rights . Watch on Friday in the offices formerly occupied by Kusa as head of the . Libyan foreign ministry. Their authenticity has not been officially confirmed. Headlined ‘for Musa in Tripoli from . Mark in London’, the letter about Belhadj is thought to have been . written by Sir Mark Allen, MI6’s then counter-terrorism chief, who now . works for BP. It was written days before Tony Blair arrived in Tripoli for the notorious ‘Deal in the Desert’ in March 2004. In the letter, the writer discusses . the arrangements for the PM’s visit, including the suggestion that . Downing Street wanted Mr Blair and the Libyan leader to appear in a tent . together because the image would appeal to the British public. Alarmingly, at the end of the letter . he congratulates Musa Kusa on the arrival of Mr Belhadj, who Human . Rights Watch said is also known as Abu Abd Allah Sadiq, and appears to . indicate the rendition was carried out by the U.S. on the basis of . British intelligence. There is no suggestion, however, that Britain was directly involved in the operation to capture him. Hug for a monster: Former Prime Minster Tony Blair with Colonel Gaddafi in Sirte, Libya in 2007 . Taking clear credit for the fact that Belhadj is in Libyan custody, he writes: ‘I am so glad. I was grateful to you for helping the officer we sent out last week. Abu Abd Allah’s information on the situation in this country is of urgent importance to us.’ He also boasts of keeping the Americans in the dark and dealing with Musa Kusa directly, and refers to the prisoner as ‘air cargo’. He added: ‘Amusingly, we got a request from the Americans to channel requests for information from Abu Abd Allah through the Americans. I have no intention of doing any such thing. ‘The intelligence about Abu Abd Allah was British. I know I did not pay for the air cargo. But I feel I have the right to deal with you direct on this and am very grateful to you for the help you are giving us.’ Last night the leading human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson QC said the documents should be passed to the Gibson inquiry which is considering allegations of British complicity in torture. He said: ‘MI6 were entirely right to have dealings with Libyan intelligence in 2004 to obtain information . . . but they had no right to assist Gaddafi’s regime by illegal rendition – putting dissidents in the hands of a brutal agency that was well known to use torture and murder.’ The documents show how British intelligence led to Belhadj being captured in Bangkok on in March 2004. MI6 knew of his whereabouts because Belhadj was attempting to seek asylum in the UK. Documents show that five days before he was taken back to Tripoli, MI6 gave Libya Belhaj’s French and Moroccan aliases, and told them he was in detention in Sepang, Malaysia. The papers also suggest that there were at least eight occasions when the CIA sent terrorism suspects for questioning in Libya. Other documents expose how Sir Mark flattered the Libyan spy chief, at one point thanking him for ‘a large volume of dates and oranges’. Spies also sent Christmas greetings, helped obtain telephone numbers and details of Libyan dissidents in the UK, the documents suggest. Musa Kusa, who fled the regime with the assistance of MI6 in February, came to the UK and is now thought to be in the Middle East. Last night the Foreign Office appeared to confirm they were genuine when a spokesman said: ‘It is the Government’s longstanding policy not to comment on intelligence matters. ‘Nor would we comment on leaked British documents.’ Sir Mark did not respond to requests for comment. A BP spokesman declined to comment.","Letter appears to show MI6 provided intelligence which led to the 'rendition' of a Libyan dissident .

"A vigilante motorist is facing a $48,000 fine for allegedly using an illegal cell phone signal jammer in his SUV to keep drivers around him off the phone. The Federal Communications Commission says that Jason R. Humphreys hid the jammer in his SUV and operated it every day on the Interstate 4 in Florida for about two years before he was caught. The 60-year-old driver allegedly admitted he deployed the jammer, which transmits radio signals that interfere with or block electronic communications, to stop motorists driving while using their cells. But the FCC claims the repercussions were far more serious - he was jamming cell phone towers and, potentially, the communications of emergency responders. 'The moral issue is that it's just very dangerous,' Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office spokesman Larry McKinnon told ABC Action News. Scroll down for video . Vehicle: Sherriff's deputies allegedly found the cell phone jammer hidden beneath a seat cover in the back seat of Jason Humprehys' blue Toyota Highlander (pictured) Scene: The FCC were alerted to the phone jamming in April 2013, when their enforcement bureau received a complaint from Metro PCS about interference to their cell phone towers on the I-4 between Seffern and Tampa (pictured) at the same two times every day . The FCC were alerted to the serious offense in April 2013, when their enforcement bureau received a complaint from Metro PCS about interference to their cell phone towers. The company noticed that their sites between Seffner and Tampa were getting scrambled during the morning and evening commute times every day. FCC agents used direction finding techniques to determine that strong wideband emissions were coming out of a blue Toyota Highlander SUV driven by Humphreys. With the help of the Sheriff's office, agents pulled the Seffner man over. The report states that as they got close to Humphreys' car, they experienced interruption to their two-way portable radios. According to officials, the driver admitted to using the jammer between 2011 and 2013 s and kept it underneath the seat cover on the passenger side. 'He indicated on the day that we stopped him that he was pretty much fed up with watching cell phone usage while people were driving,' police spokesman McKinnon said. In Florida, it's not illegal to make a phone call on your cell while driving, but you can only text when you're stationary. Jammer: Florida's Jason R. Humphreys is accused of hiding a cell phone jammer (like the one pictured) in his SUV and using it every day to stop other motorists from using their cell while driving . When officials seized the jammer, Metro PCS reported the interference at their towers stopped. Jamming devices are banned in the United States because they can compromise the calls of police and other emergency responders. Humphreys has 30 days to either pay the $48,000 fine or file a written response with the FCC. According to McKinnon, the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office also filed charges against Humphreys directly with the State Attorney's Office. Humphreys has not commented publicly on the case.","Jason R. Humphreys facing a $48,000 fine .

"As I circled the huge roundabout at the foot of the motorway for the fourth time, my throat started closing, my stomach was gripped in a vice, and my arms were so shaky I feared I might lose control of the steering wheel. I screeched at my eldest son, Daniel, in the front passenger seat, to help me make sense of the satnav. ‘Is it really telling me to turn up the M1?!’ When Daniel, 12, confirmed it was, I knew that despite the excited chatter of my younger children and a friend’s daughter in the back, our trip to Hendon RAF Museum was cancelled. ‘Sorry kids,’ I barked. ‘We’ve got to go home.’ Scroll down for video . Helen Carroll has attended  Drive Therapy sessions in order to overcome her phobia of being behind the wheel . Aware of my anxiety on unfamiliar roads, my children knew better than to make a fuss — but my friend’s daughter, whose mother was due to meet us at the museum, sobbed. My guilt at being so hopeless compounded my feelings of deep shame. Despite passing my test 22 years earlier, I was in the grip of a severe driving phobia — just like an estimated one-third of the population, the majority of whom are women. In my circle of friends, I know six otherwise highly competent women who have a licence but are too scared to drive, and others who are too nervous to even learn. But in that moment at the bottom of the M1, I resolved to do something about my fear. I could not continue to allow myself to limit my family’s enjoyment. I recalled a conversation a few months earlier with another mum about Drive Therapy, a course taught by driving instructor Carmine Mastrogiacomo, who is also a life coach and practises cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) — a psychotherapy to help reverse negative thinking. His course is tailored for people who have passed their test but are nervous about driving. Helen with her sister Jane, who was killed in a road accident when she was eight years old . I plucked up the courage to call him a year ago, and he recommended weekly sessions where I’d drive with him for an hour at a cost of £45. I would also have to do homework — driving to unfamiliar places alone between sessions. He asked what my goal was, and when I told him it was to drive anywhere I fancied without dreading the journey, he assured me that was entirely achievable. The first session was conducted over the phone with Carmine asking about the roots of my phobia and what aspects of driving I feared. I didn’t need a psychology degree to work out that the trauma of seeing my eight-year-old sister knocked down and killed when I was nine had given me my unhealthy fear of roads. We were holding hands on our way home from school in Bradford, West Yorkshire, and walking across a zebra crossing on a dual carriageway when a car came down the inside lane and hit Jane at speed. Her death devastated our family and, as the slightly older sibling, I blamed myself. It was years before I came to terms with her loss. So, it is unsurprising that I was reluctant to learn to drive and only did so at 24 because not having a licence was hindering my career. I passed first time, perhaps because I refused to take my test until I’d had lessons for over a year. But I lived in fear of being sent on journalistic assignments to unfamiliar places. If I was, I’d experience symptoms of acute anxiety — palpitations, sweating, difficulty swallowing and extreme nausea, sometimes to the point of vomiting before getting into the car and venturing into the terrifying unknown. Motorways were particularly scary but my big fears were getting lost — my sense of direction is poor, and my map-reading skills poorer — and becoming so focused on finding my way that I’d stop concentrating and cause a terrible accident. Fortunately, my husband Dillon would happily drive me on longer trips, his work permitting. But my ineptitude was a source of immense shame to me. My first Drive Therapy task was a short drive along London’s North Circular, the busy dual carriageway that runs within a couple of hundred yards of my front door, with Carmine at my side. He told me driving phobias can take many forms. ‘For some it’s anxiety about dealing with other road users, feeling rushed by vehicles behind, dealing with complex junctions and roundabouts or driving at night. Symptoms include heart palpitations, difficulty breathing, intense sweating and wanting to escape the situation. These lead to avoidance, which makes the phobia worse. ‘Causes can vary but usually result from a traumatic experience, such as a car accident — feelings about which are triggered when you encounter something similar.’ My homework was to do the same journey alone. I was gripped by fear as I drove down the slip road — panicked that the other drivers wouldn’t let me in, then terrified of increasing my speed to 50mph in case I lost control, then sick to the stomach that I might not be able to change lanes in time to leave at the exit. But I managed to calm myself using commentary driving, a technique Carmine had taught me, which involves describing aloud all the things you can see on the roads and pavements as you drive. The aim? To prevent your mind running wild and imagining all sorts of alarming scenarios. ‘Coming up on my right is a Tesco, followed by Wembley Stadium; lights at the pelican crossing are changing, I’m slowing down, letting the man with the little girl on the scooter cross; the furthest vehicle I can see is a blue van . . .’ I talked to myself constantly. I didn’t care that I looked mad. My fear of driving was receding, and when I arrived home I had a huge smile on my face. Over the next few months, I mastered several routes on the North Circular — including to Ikea in Edmonton and Brent Cross Shopping Centre. I’d commentate the whole way, and Carmine would ask what emotions I was feeling at different points in the journey. He told me to focus on the feel of the steering wheel in my hands, the seat beneath me, and the sights, sounds and smells around me. I drove to these same places week in, week out, in between our sessions to build my confidence. Finally, I cracked the big one — the journey to the RAF Museum, but on a non-motorway route. However, it took several trips with Carmine before I plucked up the courage to go alone. He told me to study Google Maps beforehand to get an idea of the route, so nothing would take me by surprise. Recognising landmarks was a huge help. Having conquered the museum, I felt ready to hit the motorway. In April, eight months after starting Drive Therapy, I took my first trip to Bluewater shopping centre on the M25, with Carmine at my side. It felt like a miracle — before, just traffic reports about the M25 would send me into a cold sweat. I was amazed to find that I was perfectly comfortable and in control bombing along at 70mph — commentary driving and reminding myself not to grip the steering wheel too tightly. In fact, in comparison to navigating the congested, narrow roads of North London, motorway driving felt like a breeze. My next challenge was the M1. At first my legs felt shaky on the pedals but I suddenly became calm and in control. Finally, I knew I had seen off my demons. My last session with Carmine was three months ago when I decided I was ready to go it alone. He told me: ‘I knew you were more than ready from that first session — which is true of most of my clients. You just had to discover that for yourself.’ Since then I haven’t been able to get enough of driving — whizzing my family to and from Gatwick Airport, to visit friends in Somerset and to see our family in Bradford. I’ve also spent so much money at Brent Cross and Ikea that my husband rues the day I discovered Drive Therapy. This weekend we’re going to visit friends in Hampshire. I’ll be driving, of course. And if I start talking to myself, I know he’ll understand. SEE csmdrivetherapy.co.uk .","Helen passed her driving test 22 years ago .

"Three Russians have been reported to the police after they forced a cat into a tumble dryer and filmed themselves laughing as it was spun at high speed. The shocking video shows two women and a man apparently in the bathroom of their home in the Bezhetsk in western Russia's Bezhetsky District, where they are debating about how to dry out the wet cat, which has just been bathed. They then raise the lid on the old-style Dawoo tumble dryer and shove the pet inside, with the young woman on camera, Alyona, 21, filmed by the other saying that she was going to put it on the six-minute cycle. The man, identified only by his first name of Ilya, and who had stuffed the cat into the tumble dryer, suggests they leave it only for a few seconds as the cat would probably die otherwise. After switching the machine on and off, they take the cat out which is so disorientated by the high-speed cycle that it cannot even stand. They then grab the groggy cat and drop it back almost lifeless into the spin dryer for a second cycle. The trio can be heard laughing as the cat at one point falls onto the floor and one of the young women makes a silly face crossing her eyes to impersonate the animal. Three Russians have been reported to the police for cruelly forcing a cat into a tumble dryer . She says: 'I wonder what the cat is going to look like when it comes out.' The cat, apparently named Sonya, is dumped on the floor and at the close of the video is seen walking in small circles so disorientated that she can no longer even properly stand. The trio then shared the video online on Alyona's Russian social media where it quickly went viral, causing a massive backlash with critics calling for police to investigate. The footage was quickly removed after that, but not before it was downloaded by other users and circulated. A police spokesman confirmed they were looking into the incident but did not say whether any arrests have been made. According to Russian media, which did not provide full names for the trio, the cat has been put into a shelter where a new home is being sought for it. The cat is held by its front paws and paraded in front of the camera before being put back into the dryer . After deleting the video about the incident Alyona then posted a message on social media defending herself and her friends against critics. She said: 'To all those attacking me and my friends let me start from the beginning, don't believe all the rubbish that you read. 'It was never our intention to kill the cat and there was no water inside the machine. 'People who claim to have heard the sound of the cat's head bashing against the side are talking rubbish. 'The knocking sound was only the noise of the plastic cover beating against the side. 'And in any case, the video is now very old and the cat was not harmed. In fact it was handed over to another family a long time ago and is perfectly all right. 'To all those who criticise my family, I say you are disgusting. You are talking about me and our parents and yet you are behaving worse than we did. 'I ask you to draw your own conclusions about that. I also want to ask why you are so silent about everything else that is going on, which is so much worse. 'What about the treatment of war veterans or the murder of people by all sorts of souls. Why is there no one getting so upset about Crimea but everybody going on about a cat?'","The Russian were drying out the cat which had just been bathed .

"Patriotic Scots have been flocking to a tattoo parlour in Kirkcaldy to get free ‘YES’ logos inked on their bodies. Aphra Wilson, owner of Spaghetti Tattoos, has been inundated with requests by customers who want to show their support for the campaign for independence. Ms Wilson, who is a passionate supporter of of the Yes campaign, began offering the tattoos in June after inking herself with the word ‘YES’. She then got dozens of responses on Facebook from customers who wanted similar designs. She eventually decided to invite anyone who wanted a pro-independence tattoo to come along and get one for a donation of £2 to a local Yes campaign headquarters. Ms Wilson’s shop is adorned with posters supporting the Yes campaign and voters have now been queuing outside her shop to have her designs tattooed on themselves. She said that she has been campaigning herself for the Yes vote. She said: ‘Over the last few months I have just become increasingly passionate about it, and find out as much as I can about it to pass that information to other people. ‘I got a Yes tattoo myself, which got a phenomenal response on Facebook. From that another two guys got in touch with me to get similar tattoos. Aphra Wilson's tattoo parlour in Kirkcaldy has been adorned with flags supporting the Yes campaign . Spaghetti Tattoos in Kirkcaldy has been inundated with requests by customers who want to show their support for the campaign for independence . ‘It snowballed from there. All the money that is made will be given to Yes campaign. ‘A Yes campaigner came round with lots of leaflets, stickers and information to give away, so everyone that comes in to the shop to get a tattoo can take that away with them and read up on it as well.’ One of the first customers to get one of Ms Wilson’s tattoos was 19-year-old Camilla Wilkinson. She told the Buzzffed website that there was friction between her and the rest of her family, who are voting No to independence. She got a tattoo of a saltire butterfly behind her ear. Her father, who is from Belfast, believes that Scotland should be part of the UK and she said she would not tell him about her tattoo. Pro-independence voters have been asked to make a  donation of £2 to a local Yes campaign headquarters . Many customers have asked for designs of butterflys in the colours of Scotland's Saltire flag . Other customers have asked for more bold designs to show their allegiance to the independence campaign . ‘He would probably disown me,’ she said. ‘We just don’t talk about the referendum.’ Alastair MacNab, 57, got the word YES tattooed in block capital letters during a visit to the tattoo parlour on his birthday. He said his stepdaughter suggested he get the tattoo to publicly show his support. He said: ‘I thought, why not?’ He told Buzzfeed that most of his family had got similar tattoos, although his stepdaughter had decided against it. ‘I don’t like the idea of getting the same tattoo as everyone else,’ she said. Scot Tracy Cunningham, 36, brought her two children before all three got tattoos. Ann Gillon, 23, got a butterfly in the colours of the Saltire, explaining she had decided to support the Yes campaign after learning that Britain’s Trident nuclear programme is based in Scotland. She said Scottish people should have a choice in the matter. Her boyfriend Peter Anderson also got the same tattoo inked behind his ear. Rhiannon Kennedy, 24, got her third pro-independence tattoo at Ms Wilson’s parlour, revealing she returned to the shop each time the owner announced she was offering the £2 tattoos since June.","Patriotic tattoo artist is a passionate supporter of the Yes campaign .

"A trainee surgeon launched a passionate defence of the NHS against threat posed by independence, saying she had been spurred into action by the ‘lies’ of Alex Salmond’s SNP. In a highly-emotional speech at a rally in Glasgow, Vicki Greig, 28, told how her mother had only been able to walk her down the aisle when she tied the knot on Sunday thanks to the expert NHS care she received to treat breast cancer. Miss Greig condemned SNP claims about the privatisation of the NHS by London were ‘dishonest, unethical and wrong’, and had been made while Mr Salmond was secretly planning £500million in in cuts if he wins independence. Scroll down for video . In a highly-charged speech to a Better Together rally in Glasgow, Vicki Greig, 28, told how she had been spurred into speaking out by SNP scare stories about NHS privatisation . Hundreds of No campaigners gathered in the Community Hall in Glasgow today, to hear from political leaders including Gordon Brown, Alistair Darling, Johann Lamont, Willie Rennie and Ruth Davidson. But the event was electrified by the deeply personal stories of members of the public who were asked to speak. Miss Greig told how she is training as an oral surgeon in Glasgow, and of her own personal debt to the NHS for saving her own life, and that of her mother Moira. ‘I was born in an NHS hospital, like most of you here,’ she said. ‘I was in and out of A&E countless times as a child. I was treated in an NHS hospital when I had a heart condition.’ She said that like most people she has the NHS to thank for ‘saving the life of a loved one’. She added: ‘My mother was diagnosed with stage three breast cancer in 2004. ‘Thanks to the expert care she received on the NHS, and being a part of an experimental drug trial, funded by the NHS, my mum was there to walk me down the aisle, with my father and I, when I got married on Sunday.’ Miss Greig received a standing ovation for her passionate plea for people to vote No in tomorrow's historic referendum . Miss Greig said her mother Moira would not be alive now were it not for the NHS, and insisted lives were saved because the NHS worked across the UK . Miss Greig married Rolls Royce engineer Ian McNeull, 28, in a humanist ceremony in Aberdeen on Sunday. He has voted Yes in the referendum. She added: ‘The thing about the NHS we don’t realise just how precious it is until we need it.’ The NHS was rightly celebrated at key moments in national life, including the London Olympics, but it has ‘sadly’ become a major issue of the referendum campaign. Mr Salmond has claimed that independence is the only way to protect the health service in Scotland from cuts and privatisation imposed by Westminster. But a leaked report revealed Mr Salmond is planning £450million in cuts if he secures independence. Tearing into the SNP, Miss Greig added: ‘Let me be absolutely clear, I have never done anything like this in my life. ‘I would not be here today if it wasn’t for the lies I have been told by the SNP. They have been dishonest, they’ve been unethical and they have been wrong. ‘They’ve acted in a way which was in direct contrast with all of my professional values and everything I vowed to uphold when I graduated. ‘They have attempted to manipulate the most vulnerable people in our country, those reliant on the NHS, patients & carers alike by preying on their fears. ‘They told lies about privatisation to frighten people into voting to leave our friends and family across the UK. ‘And the whole time they were doing it, they were hiding half a billion pounds of cuts for our NHS. ‘We deserve better than that. Our vulnerable deserve better than that. Scotland deserves better than that.’ Miss Greig was on the stage at the rally as Gordon Brown set out his passionate defence of the Union yet . Hundreds of people gathered at the Community Hall in Glasgow for the final Better Together rally of the referendum campaign, ahead of tomorrow's vote . To a standing ovation she added: ‘That’s why I’m voting No tomorrow. I’m voting No for a better Scotland. I’m voting No to protect our NHS.’ The future of the NHS has become the central background in the final hours of the campaign, with Better Together accusing Alex Salmond of lying about cuts. The Yes campaign had claimed that only by voting for independence could Scots protect the health service from an agenda of cuts and privatisation from Westminster. But analysts revealed how NHS spending has risen in England but fallen in Scotland under Mr Salmond. A leaked report revealed how the NHS in Scotland faces a £450million financial black hole, with new promises ’not fully funded’. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown told the rally: The greatest risk to our health and public services isn’t the one posed by independence. 'The biggest threat to the NHS is not the Union. With their secret plan for half a billion pounds of cuts, it is the SNP. Let’s tell the people of Scotland they are not saving the NHS but using the NHS to save the SNP. 'Let the people of Scotland be clear that the SNP don’t wake up in the morning with a mission to save the NHS, they wake up with a mission to use it to create a separate state.' There was a small group of Yes campaigners outside the Community Central Hall, with police guarding the entrance while Mr Brown was in the building . A new hard hitting leaflet aimed from the No campaign states: ’Alex Salmond has LIED to you about the NHS. ’His secret plan to make half a billion pounds of NHS cuts AFTER the referendum has been exposed. The case for separation had been based on a big NHS LIE.’ In her speech, one of five from ordinary voters including a shipbuilder, a pensioner, a 16-year-old schoolgirl and a mother, Miss Greig said she was always going to vote No. ‘I see no reason to take a Union that’s been hugely successful for Scotland and the rest of the UK. ‘It works not just by pooling and sharing our resources across the UK, which secures for the NHS, but it forms a partnership, which means training, research and services are shared. ‘It means lives are shared and care is given, not based on nationality but on need. ‘Every man woman, woman and child across Scotland have access to specialist NHS centres north and south of the border.’","Vicki Greig, 27, wows final Better Together rally with personal plea on NHS .

"The U.S. Vogue editor unveiled her debut issue of the magazine in November, 1988 . It had featured Israeli model Michaela Bercu in a pair of jeans, an item of clothing that had never been worn on a fashion magazine cover previously . Anna Wintour shocked the fashion world in 1988 when she put a model on the cover of U.S. Vogue in jeans. It was her debut issue as editor of the fashion title and it was bold move to team casual wear with haute couture. Now, Ms Wintour, 62, has revealed that the unlikely look came about because Israeli model Michaela Bercu had been too chubby to fit into the Christian Lacroix skirt that matched the top in the photo. Unique: Anna Wintour's famous 1988 Vogue cover (above) featured the first cover model to wear jeans. The editor has revealed that she only put Israeli model Michaela Bercu in jeans because she couldn't fit into a skirt . The editor, who served as the unofficial inspiration behind the The Devil Wears Prada, wrote on the magazine's blog yesterday: 'Michaela was wearing an haute couture . Christian Lacroix jacket with a beaded cross, all very ""Like a Prayer,"" and stonewashed Guess jeans. 'The jacket was actually part of a suit, but . the skirt didn't fit Michaela; she had been on vacation back home in . Israel and had gained a little weight.' She added that it didn't matter that the stunning model, who is now aged 45, did not fit into the skirt. Stylish: The editor, seen above in New York on May 7, said that the 1998 cover broke all the rules . 'In fact, it only served to reinforce the idea to . take couture's haughty grandeur and playfully throw it headlong into . real life and see what happened,' Ms Wintour wrote. The ever-impeccable editor admitted that the magazine's printers at the time had questioned her creative judgement. They had 'called up and asked with some consternation, ""Has there been a mistake?"" She added that the cover image was so 'unlike the studied and elegant close-ups that were typical of Vogue's covers back then, with tons of makeup and major jewelry'. 'I couldn't blame them,' she wrote. 'This one broke all the rules.' She continued: 'Michaela wasn't looking at you, and . worse, she had her eyes almost closed. Her hair was blowing across her . face. 'It looked easy, casual, a moment that had been snapped on the . street, which it had been, and which was the whole point.' Vogue has just released its enormous September issue with Lady Gaga on the cover, which celebrates the magazine's 120 years in the publishing industry. Ms Wintour said that working on the new issue helped conjure up past memories of the controversial cover that helped cement her place of power within the industry. She added that the cover was interpreted in all sorts of ways at the time. 'It was about mixing high and low, Michaela was pregnant, it was a religious statement,' she wrote. 'But none of these things was true.' She continued: 'I had just looked at that picture and sensed the winds of change. And you can't ask for more from a cover image than that.' The editor is said to be working with Sarah Jessica Parker in selecting the actress' wardrobe when she guest stars on the forthcoming season of Glee. The pair were spotted lunching in New York together just days after the announcement was made. Ms Jessica Parker will play an editor of Vogue.com in the hit show's fourth season, which premieres on September 13.","The U.S. Vogue editor unveiled her debut issue of the magazine in November, 1988 .

"Busted at Tiffany: Ingrid Lederhaas-Okun, 46, has been given a year in prison after stealing $1.2m jewellery . A former executive from Tiffany & Co. was sentenced to one year and one day in prison on Friday for stealing more than $1.2 million in jewelry from its famous Fifth Avenue location, a crime that a judge called an inexplicable act of self-destruction by someone who didn't need the money. Ingrid Lederhaas-Okun had pleaded guilty this year to one count of interstate transportation of stolen property. Her lawyer had asked for a sentence of six months while the government sought at least three years. 'I'm very sorry for everything that's happened,' a tearful Lederhaas-Okun told the judge before hearing the sentence in federal court in New York City. 'I can't express my remorse enough.' U.S. District Judge Paul G. Gardephe rejected prosecutors' arguments that the 46-year-old defendant was motivated by greed, noting that she came from a privileged background, made $360,000 a year at Tiffany and lived in a $4 million house in upscale Darien, Connecticut. A month after her arrest in July, Lederhaar-Okun put that home on the market, and it's still for sale. Her attorney claimed that she suffered from depression and cracked under the pressures of not being able to have children, getting passed over for a promotion at Tiffany and seeing her marriage crumble. But Gardephe said it was impossible to . know what set Lederhaas-Okun on a path of 'self-destruction which could . only have one outcome - disaster'.

'This was not a crime of impulse,' he said. 'The defendant made many bad decisions over many years.' As vice president of product development, Lederhaas-Okun had authority to check out jewelry from Tiffany to provide to potential manufacturers to determine production costs. Authorities alleged that after she left Tiffany in February, the company discovered she had checked out 164 items that were never returned. The items included numerous diamond bracelets in 18-carat gold, diamond drop and hoop earrings in platinum or 18-carat gold, diamond rings in platinum, rings with precious stones in 18-carat gold, and platinum and diamond pendants.

But an . investigation found that Lederhaas-Okun resold some of the goods to an . unidentified international dealer for more than $1.3 million. Other . items were found in her home.

Investigators also recovered purchase forms signed by Lederhaas-Okun . that said the items were her personal property. Authorities alleged Lederhaas-Okun purposely checked out items valued at under $10,000 apiece to avoid detection. The company takes a daily inventory of all checked-out items worth more than $25,000. Little blue box: The former VP pleaded guilty to stealing 164 pieces of Tiffany jewellery in her role as head of merchandise . According to Lederhaas-Okun's LinkedIn profile, she attended Georgetown University in D.C. She . was a vice-president at Tiffany until March this year when she was let . go as part of 'downsizing' after 22 years with the company.

"Atasha Graham died after suffering a massive allergic reaction that may have been triggered by the glue in her hair extensions after a night out dancing . A woman died from a massive allergic reaction that could have been caused by the glue in her hair extensions, a pathologist said yesterday. Atasha Graham, 34, who had used hair extensions for 14 years, collapsed after clubbing until the early hours. Home Office pathologist Michael Heath told the inquest into her death that the latex glue used to apply her extensions – or the solvent for removing old ones – may have been to blame. He added: ‘I’ve seen cases where people using solvent to apply extensions has actually caused anaphylactic shock. ‘There are about ten to 20 deaths a year in this country, many more in America. I have seen four in the last three months.’ Dr Heath told the hearing at Southwark Coroner’s Court in London: ‘The hair extensions in Atasha’s hair were of a latex type. This may or may not be related [to her death]. If it is the hair extension, normally a reaction would occur within half an hour of applying them.’ But he added that traces of glue or solvent could have seeped into her bloodstream hours later after she started perspiring on the dancefloor. He ruled out reactions to food and alcohol and said there were no drugs in her system. On May 15 last year, Jamaican-born Miss Graham had been dancing at a club where her boyfriend, Fenton Johnson, was the DJ. Mr Johnson said Miss Graham, one of nine children, was fine until she stepped through the doorway of their home in Lee, south-east London, at 6.30am, then suddenly collapsed and stopped breathing. He called an ambulance and tried to resuscitate her as 999 operators gave him first aid instructions over the phone.  But she never properly regained consciousness and died later in hospital. A post-mortem failed to find any abnormalities with her organs or substances which could have caused her death. Her younger brother Carlus, who . attended the inquest with his wife Marsha, said: 'This is the most . frustrating thing of all. We still don’t know what happened.' The inquest heard Ms Graham had been . drinking Hennessy brandy and Red Bull hours before she died, but only . had a moderate amount of alcohol in her body which could not have caused . her death. Dr Heath did not find any kind of drugs or substances in her body. Southwark Coroner's Court: Coroner Christopher Williams recorded a verdict of death by natural causes as he said it was not possible to identify a clear link with a particular allergen that caused Ms Graham's body to go into shock . Jamaican-born Ms Graham, who had . eaten takeaway jerk pork and Chinese before going out, did not have any . history of food allergies. Dr . Heath said an allergic reaction to food would normally occur within . half an hour of consumption so he did not think it could have been . anything she ate. He . then examined a hair piece Ms Graham wore to see if there could have . been an allergic reaction to the latex glue used to attach it to her . natural hair. But the pathologist said he would . expect an allergic reaction to occur shortly after the glue was applied . and Atasha had been wearing extensions, which she got done in salons, . since the age of 20. Link? The hair used in hair extensions may have caused the death of Atasha Graham . After . lengthy discussions with experts the pathologist said he was certain . the cause of death was anaphylactic shock as the level of tryptase, . which occurs naturally in the body during an allergic reaction, was 178 . micrograms per litre of blood - up to 25 times higher than the normal . amount of between two and 14 micrograms per litre. However, he said he could not pinpoint exactly what was the trigger was. Dr Heath added: 'The diagnosis is correct, but I am not sure what triggered it. 'If she had recovered we could have carried out tests, but the situation we have, tragically, we cannot take it any further. Coroner Christopher Williams recorded a verdict of death by natural causes as he said it was not possible to identify conclusively a link with a particular allergen that caused her to go into shock. He said: 'She had an allergic . reaction to something as the level of tryptase in her body was 178 . micrograms, but we are not able to identify what the specific agent was . that that caused this reaction.' Speaking afterwards, Mr Johnson, Ms . Graham's partner of two years with whom she had been trying to have a . baby, described her as a 'wonderful person' who helped him turn his life . around. Mr Johnson said: 'She changed me a lot. It’s so shocking this could have happened. I still have to keep looking at pictures of her on my phone.' Ms Graham’s brother, Carlus, 32, added: 'She was such a nice person. She loved kids. She was fun-loving. 'She just enjoyed her life, enjoyed doing what made her happy. 'I was younger than her by two years, but we were like twins. She even taught me how to read and write. 'The last time I spoke to her was the Friday before this happened. I remember her every day.'","Pathologist tells inquest there are ten to 20 deaths a year caused by allergic reaction to hair extension glue .

"A great-grandmother died after she was left waiting for at least 40 minutes in a queue of 15 ambulances outside a hospital’s accident and emergency department yesterday. Sonia Powell, 73, who had suffered a heart attack, was kept waiting outside Morriston Hospital in Swansea - and died just 24 hours after her younger sister Cheryl Davies, 64, also passed away. Today, her relatives demanded an apology from health chiefs, following a warning from the British Medical Association that the NHS in Wales was facing ‘imminent meltdown’. Double death: Sonia Powell (left), 73, who had suffered a heart attack, was kept waiting in an ambulance outside a hospital - and died just 24 hours after losing her younger sister Cheryl Davies (right), 64 . The family of Mrs Powell - who was being moved 12 miles north-west from Neath Port Talbot Hospital - claimed a doctor had only been with her for a few minutes before she died outside Morriston. Granddaughter Kim Thompson said Mrs Powell had suffered a heart attack yesterday morning after being admitted to Neath Port Talbot on Monday. Mrs Thompson said the family was told she would be moved if her condition worsened, which was the case - but when Mrs Powell arrived at Morriston there was confusion over why she was there. The 31-year-old said: ‘The ambulance man took the notes to a doctor, who asked what the lady was doing there.’ She said that a doctor at Morriston said there had been nothing to gain by transferring her to the larger hospital. Mrs Thompson added: ‘We were not happy. She was very, very unwell and should never have been moved in the first place.’ She claimed that her grandmother was in the ambulance for an hour - not the 30 or 40 minutes claimed by the Welsh Ambulance Service and Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board. Mrs Thompson said: ‘It was only two minutes before my gran passed away that the registrar or doctor turned up at the ambulance. We really want an apology for the way they treated her.’ Mrs Powell lived in Neath with her . husband Raymond who was being comforted by relatives today.  The WAS and . ABMUHB confirmed they had launched a review into the incident outside . Morriston. They said in a joint statement: ‘The . emergency department at Morriston Hospital has been very busy with a . high number of ambulances arriving in a short space of time. ‘Escalation . plans have been activated and staff across the hospital are working . closely with colleagues from Wast (Welsh Ambulance Service Trust) to . keep delays to a minimum.’ Long delays: Officials said the emergency department at Morriston Hospital (pictured) in Swansea, south Wales, had been 'very busy with a high number of ambulances arriving in a short space of time' Officials confirmed the patient arrived at Morriston from another hospital at about 3.05pm yesterday. A . statement read: ‘The patient was assessed immediately upon arrival and . remained in the care of a doctor and the ambulance crew whilst waiting . to be admitted into hospital. ‘Sadly, at approximately 3.40pm the patient passed away. We wish to express our sincere condolences to the patient’s family.’ Later today, a further statement from . ABMUHB said: ‘The Health Board is reviewing all aspects of what happened . and we are currently discussing these with the family. 'We were not happy. She was very, very unwell and should never have been moved in the first place' Kim Thompson, granddaughter . ‘We can confirm the ambulance with two paramedics on board left Neath Port Talbot Hospital at 2.49pm and arrived at Morriston Hospital at 3.04pm. ‘The emergency department doctor began his assessment of the patient in the ambulance at 3.07pm. A doctor remained with Mrs Powell on the ambulance until she sadly passed away at 3.40pm.’ A spokesman added if a patient deteriorated in a ‘supporting’ hospital and could benefit from treatment available at an ‘acute hospital’, ABMUHB would arrange for an ambulance to transfer them. ‘Yesterday was a busy day for emergency departments and this was intensified at Morriston by 20 emergency ambulances arriving and departing within a short space of time,’ she continued. ‘At its peak, there were 12 operational ambulances outside the department but not all had patients on board.’ ABMUHB also stressed, upon arrival that all . medical emergencies were assessed by a doctor in the emergency department to ensure ‘they receive the most appropriate treatment before . being transferred to a bed’. Location: The woman had been waiting in the vehicle outside Morriston Hospital in Swansea (pictured) In recent months there has been . growing concern about Wales’s NHS as well as ambulance service . performance. Yesterday, the BMA called for an independent inquiry into . the health service. The . organisation, which represents around 7,000 doctors in Wales, published . a report listing numerous problems it believes the Welsh Government . must address. BMA Welsh Council chairman Dr Phil Banfield said members’ feedback indicated the service was struggling to cope. He said: ‘The sooner this (inquiry) takes place, the better. There’s a lot of sticking heads in the sand . still going on. Our greatest fear is it will become impossible to have . an NHS in Wales.’ 'The . emergency department at Morriston Hospital has been very busy with a . high number of ambulances arriving in a short space of time' Welsh Ambulance Service and Abertawe Bro Morgannwg Health Board . The issue of ambulance response times has also been raised several times by opposition parties in the Welsh Assembly. According . to the latest official figures, the Welsh Ambulance Service failed to . hit response time targets for the most urgent calls for a ninth . consecutive month. Statistics . also showed that 87.7 per cent of people arriving at Welsh A&Es . were seen within four hours of arrival - the Welsh Government target is . 95 per cent. The worst-performing health board was Abertawe Bro Morgannwg, with nearly 17 per cent of patients waiting more than four hours. Health campaigners said they were extremely concerned to hear about the incident at Morriston Hospital yesterday. Among . them was Gareth Williams of the ABMU Victim Support Group. His . 82-year-old mother Lillian suffered what the health board accepted was . unacceptable treatment before her death at the Princess of Wales . Hospital in Bridgend in 2012. Moved: Officials confirmed the patient arrived at Morriston from another hospital at about 3.05pm yesterday . Mr . Williams said: ‘To hear reports a woman died while waiting more than . half an hour to be taken inside A&E doesn't really surprise me, . sadly. I don't believe you can take the incident in isolation. ‘It seems to be disaster after disaster . of late. The ongoing systemic failures at ABMU are a major concern. The . way things stand, ABMU is not fit for purpose and the need for decisive . action is long overdue.’ 'There's a lot of sticking heads in the sand still going on. Our greatest fear is it will become impossible to have an NHS in Wales' Dr Phil Banfield, British Medical Association Welsh Council chairman . Welsh Conservative Assembly Member and shadow health minister Darren Millar renewed calls for a ‘Keogh-style’ inquiry into the Welsh NHS. He said: ‘The evidence is stacking up, demonstrating that all is not well in the Welsh health service and an independent inquiry could help identify problems and put them right, before it's too late. ‘Experienced medical experts are saying that without an inquiry, some NHS services are facing imminent meltdown - a disturbing warning that Labour ministers must heed. ‘Do-gooders who defensively act as cheerleaders for their local health board and reject any sort of review are putting Welsh patients at risk. ‘We love the NHS and want to help staff deliver the best possible service for patients, but that is only possible if we have the courage to hold a thorough inquiry to identify any problems and put them right.’","Sonia Powell, 73, had been waiting outside Morriston Hospital in Swansea .

"While plain, wooden, gender-neutral dollhouses have been available through boutique toy makers for some years, it seems that mass market retailers are finally catching on. Lisa Wade, a professor of sociology at Occidental College, looked into the girl-orientated toy in lieu of the holiday season, and found a surprising number of Toys R Us dollhouses veered away from  heteronormative stereotypes, and instead 'had themes of friendship and, dare I say, female-independence.' Writing for Jezebel, she said: 'These houses had only women or, more often, a group of women and one man. They gave the impression of female home-ownership and female dominated social interaction.' Gender roles: Furnished dollhouses, like this one by Moolka, $184.99, started a movement toward mass market gender-neutral dollhouses . Dollhouses today are considered 'girly' and therefore a 'gender issue' because toy marketers have long sent pink-filled messages that they are a girls-only role playing device. However, as many parents know, both boys and girls play with dollhouses and acquire different lessons from the experience. While a girl may put a mother in the kitchen, and a boy may mow the imaginary lawn, or vice versa, children often role-play what they see their parents doing, and other families in their community doing. The need to role-play will be expressed . whether it is through a dollhouse, playing dress-up, a kitchen play . set, or stuffed animals; and big toy companies like Toys R Us and Costco . are beginning to realise that this includes both genders - not just . girls whose favourite colour is pink. Not just for girls: KidKraft® Everyday Heroes Wooden Police & Fire Playset, recently available at Costco, is a step forward in accepting that boys are also interested in role-playing with a dollhouse . Female domination: Barbie Malibu Dreamhouse, available at Toys R Us, $129.99, features a group of women and one man - giving the impression of female home-ownership and female dominated social interaction . Costco recently released a fireman-themed dollhouse, which while not gender-neutral, is a step forward in accepting that boys are also interested in role-playing with a dolls house. It also sells large, durable, unpainted wooden dolls houses 'so multiple children can play at the same time,' and create their own world within it. Ms Wade wrote: 'Among the 22 bestselling dollhouses at Toys R Us, four came without people, six came with a preponderance of females, ten came with a male, female, and children, and there were two I couldn't categorize. (All humans were white - some dollhouses included non-human creatures - and just about everyone appears to be wealthy.)' She added: 'Interestingly, most of the dollhouses that ... gave the impression of female home-ownership and female dominated social interaction, were Barbie affiliated. New world: Small World Toys Home Again A-Frame Wooden Hand-Painted Dollhouse, available at Costco, $139.99, allows multiple children to create their own world within it . 'People disagree as to whether Barbie is a good role model for young women.  She is roundly criticized for upholding a harmful standard of beauty, but she also tells women they can run for President and go to the moon. 'In this case, Barbie is sending girls the message that they can have fulfilling lives and own homes without a husband.' However some parents actually see gender-specific dollhouses that perpetuate stereotypical gender roles as irrelevant. One commenter wrote: 'If you want your kids to have alternative models of gender roles, you achieve that by modeling them as their parents, not giving them gender-neutral models to play with.","Plain, wooden dollhouses have been available on boutique websites like Etsy for a while, however now Costco and Toys R Us are taking their lead .
