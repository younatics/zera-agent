'A great gift for people who like illustrations, artwork, artistic photography, and controversial art in their decor. These pictures will definitely bring you hope, joy and comfort,' promise the creators. OC (Orthodox Calendar) was established in 2012 and is the brainchild of a group composed mostly of Orthodox Christian eastern Europeans of the former communist regions. One of the calendar's organisers told The Huffington Post that the snaps don't feature any actual priests. The models are gay-friendly members 'of the Orthodox Church' who have chosen to strip down for the sexy shoot 'because they believe - like us - in freedom of speech, tolerance, equality and human rights.'

"David Luiz says he will not celebrate if he scores against Chelsea in the Champions League. Brazilian centre-back Luiz scored an own goal in this fixture last year, when he was in Jose Mourinho’s back-four. On Tuesday he will line up against his former club for Paris Saint-Germain in the first leg of this last-16 clash. David Luiz says he will not celebrate if he scores against Chelsea in the Champions League on Tuesday . The Brazilian joker lined up alongside his manager Laurent Blanc for their pre-match press conference . Luiz scored an own goal for Chelsea on their visit to the Parc des Princes in last season's Champions League . Luiz said: 'Last year I scored my first goal for PSG and I want to do my best for the team and the club. I’m happy to be here. Maybe if I score against Chelsea, I don’t celebrate out of respect but of course, I’ll be happy.' Despite his departure for £50million in the summer, Luiz said he felt Chelsea are a stronger prospect this year than they were last season under Jose Mourinho. 'They are stronger this year,' he said. 'They understand more the philosophy of Jose Mourinho and in his second year it is easier to pass the message. And they have players joining with amazing quality like Diego (Costa) and (Cesc) Fabregas.' Comparing his new manager Laurent Blanc with former boss Mourinho, Luiz said: 'To compare them, they are both ugly, just that,' before smiling as he looked over to Blanc alongside him. 'I hope this is the year we win it (the Champions League),' he added. 'We have an amazing team but it is not easy to win the Champions League.

When asked to compare Blanc and former boss Jose Mourinho, Luiz said: 'they are both ugly, just that' Luiz holds off a challenge from Caen midfielder N'golo Kante in PSG's 2-2 draw in Ligue 1 at the weekend . 'We need to be strong, play an amazing first leg because it will be decided there. Not many players have opportunities to play these games. Everyone’s excited to play. Tomorrow can be a great moment for us. 'It doesn’t matter where you are in this kind of game, you need to be focused, mentally and physically, everything. It will be a difficult game. I want to qualify, like I did last year but now I want to qualify for PSG. And Luiz thinks the tie will be played on a level field, despite PSG's struggles in Ligue 1 this season. 'These games are decided in small details,' he said. 'Chelsea have two European titles. The project for PSG is to be the best club in the world in the next few years and try to improve every day. In the game, you have two amazing teams, good players, amazing coaches.' Chelsea will expect Luiz to be a threat, particularly at set pieces both with his feet and his head . Luiz believes there is a level playing field between his side and Chelsea - helped by Zlatan Ibrahimovic . PSG coach Blanc confirmed that PSG will be without Yohan Cabaye, Lucas Moura and Serge Aurier  through injury, with Marquinhos, Thiago Motta and Blaise Matuidi doubtful. 'We’ll see if the others are fit,' Blanc said. 'We have training at 4pm. It’s not the best way to prepare but we will know more after training.'

"Arsenal's midfield was in disarray in defeat to Monaco on Wednesday night, leaving Sky Sports pundit Jamie Redknapp claiming they 'couldn't tackle a hot dinner' and should sign Geoffrey Kondogbia. Arsenal were completely out-gunned in midfield as Monaco cantered away from the Emirates with a 3-1 win in the Champions League last 16 first-leg as Kondogbia, former Spurs striker Dimitar Berbatov and substitute Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco completed a nightmare evening for the hosts. Redknapp and fellow pundit Graeme Souness were scathing of Arsenal's lack of organisation and presence in the middle of the park in particular. Sky Sports pundits Jamie Redknapp (left) and Graeme Souness (right) laid into Arsenal's performance . Jamie Redknapp believes Monaco's first goalscorer Geoffrey Kondogbia is the player Arsenal need to sign . Redknapp slammed Arsenal's midfield and claimed the Gunners should have signed Kondogbia . 'Arsenal were off the cuff. I didn’t think Coquelin was too bad but he was taken off as he was booked so Arsenal were left with Cazorla, a wonderfully gifted attacking player, Rosicky, and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain,' Redknapp said in the Sky studio. 'That midfield couldn’t tackle a hot dinner! Kondogbia was incredible for Monaco, he was exactly the player Arsenal needed to sign.’ Souness added to the criticism of the dismal Arsenal perfromance: 'They were so, so disorganised. Arsene Wenger keeps trying to create ultimate football, they have all these creative players that want to go forward but all successful teams have contrasting types of players, people who can break up the play and ease up the pressure,' added Souness. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (right) is consoled by Theo Walcott after his mistake led to Monaco's third goal . Santi Cazorla struggled to make an impact at the foot of Arsenal's midfield during the 3-1 defeat . Sky Sports pundit Graeme Souness criticised Arsenal for their determination to play 'ultimate football' Arsenal players look stunned having put in a dismal performance against Monaco in the Champions League . 'I’ve said it many times before that Arsenal are too easy to play against, an average European team has blown them away tonight.' Arsenal will need at least three goals in Monaco during the second-leg on March 17 but crucially they will need much more pace, penetration and determination to progress: . 'It’s the first time I’ve not enjoyed a night at the Emirates watching Arsenal. There is nothing about tonight Arsenal can be happy with,' blasted Souness. Redknapp left one last damming assessment of Arsenal's performance, which he believes will fuel the critics of Wenger's recent reign: ‘Everything bad from Arsenal in the past five or six seasons we saw tonight.’ Arsene Wenger scowls during the 3-1 home defeat to Monaco in the Champions League on Wednesday .

"Navy veteran who served on Arctic convoys takes on airline over 'insulting' £60 to carry military standard . A Second World War veteran, who accused a budget airline of insulting the memory of his fallen comrades, has won a battle over baggage. Royal Navy veteran Alec Penstone, 86, was charged £60 to take a ceremonial standard on a Flybe flight to attend Jersey's Liberation Day parade. The veteran branded the fee disgusting and pursued his fight with the budget airline until it conceded it was in the wrong and amended its policy. In his letter to management Mr Penstone said: 'Without my generation of men and women and what we fought for, your aircraft would be carrying the Nazi Swastika on the wings and tail fin.' Victorious: Mr Penstone was 'insulted' by the charge to take his standard on the flight . Two other veterans were forced to abandon their company standards at Exeter Airport because they could not afford the fee, heaped on top of normal baggage charges made by the airline. Outraged Mr Penstone took his fight to Flybe management, but was told by the . complaints department the cost was correct. Undaunted, he fought on and has now earned victory in the shape of a new Flybe policy on military regalia. Mr Penstone, 86, served with the Royal Navy as a submarine detector, protecting vital cargo ships crossing the Arctic and North Sea. Sky high charges: The airline has changed its policy after Mr Penstone's complaint . Almost 70 years on, he found himself locked in the battle over what he described as a disgusting attempt to charge him to fly with his 2.5kg, 4ft 6in Royal Naval Association standard to the Jersey memorial service. He said: 'I felt it was completely unjustified. 'I have taken the standard to Murmansk, America, Malta, Jersey and Australia to attend parades and memorials for the last 22 years, and have never been charged extra. 'I was not fighting for reimbursement, rather a change in company policy. I think to charge for something like this was disgusting and an insult.' Following the victory Mr Penstone said: 'This is fantastic news.' A Flybe spokesman said: 'The charge applied to Mr Penstone at the airport was correct and in line with Flybe policy for the carriage of non-standard items in the hold. 'However Flybe fully appreciates that such a valued oversize item of military regalia needs to be carried to special events and so would like to thank him for bringing this anomaly to its attention. 'As a result Flybe is amending its rules of carriage charges to in future allow one item of military regalia to be included within the 20kg baggage allowance. 'As a gesture of goodwill Flybe will be pleased to reimburse Mr Penstone with the £60 he was charged.'",Navy veteran who served on Arctic convoys takes on airline over 'insulting' £60 to carry military standard .
"A U.S. congressman from Florida was caught last week digging his finger in his ear and then eating whatever it was he found.

"Police fear two young girls who fled Austria are inspiring other teenagers to join Islamic State ranks after they successfully fled the country saying they were going to Syria. Samra Kesinovic was aged just 16 and her friend Sabina Selimovic 15 when the two vanished this year from their homes in the Austrian capital Vienna. Soon afterwards they posted images of themselves branding Kalashnikov rifles, and in some cases surrounded by armed men. Now police have raised concerns they are inspiring their contemporaries after two other teenage girls were caught attempting to flee the country to join ISIS ranks. Left is Samra Kesinovic, 16, who is thought to have fled to Syria to join the Islamic State. On the right is 15-year-old Sabina Selimovic who went with her . Samra Kesinovic and Sabina Selimovic in a photo they posted online. Police now fear the two are inspiring other girls to flee to Syria to take up holy war . Austrian media warned several weeks ago that the girls had become the public face for the call to jihad. These fears now appear to have been validated with the Austrian Interior Ministry confirming two other girls from Vienna had attempted to flee to take up the call for holy war. Little information was given about them apart from the fact that one was 16 and the other was 14 and their parents were apparently from Iraq. Police are now hoping to find out how they became radicalised, and whether anybody had helped them plan their trip to Syria which was apparently set to take place via Turkey - following the same route as the other two girls. The pair were caught when the mother of a third friend who was supposed to be travelling with them became suspicious about the amount of luggage her daughter was packing. Samra Kesinovic and Sabina Selimovic in another photo they posted online, sometime after they fled Austria . Sabina, pictured beside jihadists wielding Kalashnikov rifles, somewhere in Syria or Iraq . It's not known if they group were in contact with Samra and Selimovic, who - despite the fact they are being hunted by Interpol - have remained missing. However, social media updates posted by the two show them dressed in traditional Muslim clothing and in some instances, standing beside men holding guns. As many as 130 people from Austria are now believed to be fighting as jihadists abroad. More than half of Austrian's jihadists originally come from the Caucasus region and have a valid residence permit in Austria. Meanwhile, two Salafists were intercepted in a German border town on the way to Syria via Austria. Austrian Interior Ministry spokesman Alexander Marakovits said they were noticing an increasing problem with youngsters wanting to leave the country for the same reason. He said: 'If we can catch them before they leave we have the chance to work with their parents and other institutions to bring the youngsters out of the sphere of influence that prompted them to act in this way the first place. 'Once they have left the country, even if they then changed their minds, it is then almost impossible to get them back.'","Two teenage girls vanished from their homes in Austrian capital Vienna .

"Cleared: Kiera Wilmot had been charged with adult felonies for her explosive experiment - but the charges have now been dropped . A Florida teen accused of sparking a chemical explosion on school grounds - and who became the subject of a grassroots social media campaign on her behalf - will not face criminal charges, authorities said today. Polk County State Attorney Jerry Hill wrote in a statement that the case against 16-year-old Kiera Wilmot has been dismissed, but that she must complete a diversion program. The teen was arrested on April 22 and faced possible felony charges after school administrators reported she combined toilet bowl cleaner and aluminum foil in a bottle, and the resulting gas blew the cap off the plastic bottle, according to the police report. Wilmot's twin sister reportedly ran out of a class crying when a fellow student asked her about the arrest. She was described by her principal as a 'good kid' who 'was never in trouble before.' Principal Ron Pritchard told 10 News: 'She . made a bad choice. Honestly, I don't think she meant to ever hurt . anyone. She wanted to see what would happen [when the chemicals mixed] . and was shocked by what it did.' The explosion happened outside, before school started, and no one was injured. Kiera told Bartow police she was doing a science experiment, but science teachers said they had no knowledge of an experiment. 'Based upon the facts and circumstances of the case, the lack of criminal history of the child involved, and the action taken by the Polk County School Board, the State Attorney's Office extended an offer of diversion of prosecution to the child,' Hill said in the statement. 'The child and her guardian signed the agreement to successfully complete the Department of Juvenile Justice Diversion Program.' Details about the program aren't public record because Kiera is a juvenile. Too cruel for school?: Kiera was arrested on April 22 and faced possible felony charges after administrators at Bartow High School, pictured, reported she had sparked an explosion while conducting what she said was a science experiment . The teen's arrest launched an outcry on social media by people who thought the arrest was unfair and heavy-handed. Nearly 200,000 people signed an online petition protesting her arrest, and her name trended on Twitter for a few days. Several heavily trafficked websites wrote about her case, saying that she shouldn't face felony charges for a science experiment gone bad - and that an arrest in the case sent the wrong message to budding scientists. Other columnists felt that Kiera was treated harshly because she is black – and that a white student doing a similar experiment wouldn't have been handcuffed and arrested. 'With this type of thinking is it any wonder Black and Latino Children are under-represented in Science Fairs,' wrote DNLee, a biologist and popular blogger for the Scientific American website. 'If everyone around you has the idea that only legitimate science experiments are those sanctioned and prescribed to students, then when are students expected to explore independent authentic science interests? In Bartow, Florida, I guess the answer is no.' Brian Haas, a spokesman for the state attorney's office, said the massive online support for Kiera had nothing to do with the decision not to prosecute. School principal Ron Pritchard said Kiera Wilmot had 'made a bad choice' but was 'a good kid' 'Not one bit,' Haas said. 'It's certainly something we were aware of. We looked at this like we would any other case involving a juvenile. We don't evaluate and make decisions on our cases based on what's being said on the Internet.' Kiera's attorney, Larry Hardaway, said on Wednesday that the teen and her mother are relieved – but that they are still negotiating with the Polk County School Board regarding Kiera's academic future. Hardaway said that Kiera is worried that people at the school think she's a 'terrorist' and is eager to clear her name there, as well. After the incident, she was suspended for 10 days. She has been attending classes at an alternative school in the district. Bartow High School Principal Ron Pritchard earlier had recommended her expulsion for a year, based on the district's Code of Conduct. That recommendation was put on hold until the criminal allegations against her were resolved. School officials said the case will go before a School Board hearing officer now that the criminal proceedings are completed. 'We look forward to resolving all of the issues,' Hardaway said.","Kiera Wilmot had mixed aluminum foil and toilet cleaner in a bottle on April 22 at Bartow High School, causing the bottle to explode .

"Archaeologists have taken a step closer to discovering the mysteries that lie inside an ancient tomb unearthed in Greece. Following months of excavation, a team of researchers has made their way into the third chamber of the tomb, in the Amphipolis region of Serres, through a wall that was only recently uncovered. But, upon entering the chamber, the archaeologists may have damaged the structural integrity of the surrounding structure - and are concerned it may collapse before they discover what lies beyond. Scroll down for interactive floor plan . Following months of excavation, a team of researchers has made their way into the third chamber of what's been dubbed Alexander the Great's tomb, in the Amphipolis region of Serres. Access was possible through a wall that was only recently uncovered (pictured) Caryatids are sculptures of females that take the place of a column to support a building. They are a distinctive feature in Ancient Greek architecture and famously hold up the Erechtheion on the Acropolis in Athens. Their elaborate hairstyles provide support to their necks that would otherwise be too thin and weak to support a heavy load. The Caryatids in the Greek tomb are made of marble and support an inner entrance into the burial plot. They . feature the same sculpting technique used for the heads and wings of . two sphinxes found guarding the main entrance of the tomb last month. Experts believe the ancient mound, situated around 65 miles (100km) from Thessaloniki, was built . for a prominent Macedonian in around 300 to 325BC. It may be the final resting place for a . relative or senior official of the famous king. Access to the third chamber was made possible after experts unearthed two sculpted female figures, known as Caryatids, last week. By removing a large volume of soil, behind the wall bearing the two sculpted female figures, they were able to uncover the next chamber. Until now, experts had only partially investigated the antechamber of the tomb and uncovered a marble wall concealing one or more inner chambers. During initial observations, archaeologists found that the dome structure (pictured) has been weakened, as a result of losing a large amount of earth, and the researchers found the arched dome of the third chamber is on the verge of collapse, due to 'deep and extensive cracks' Clockwise from top right shows two headless, marble sphinxes found above the entrance to the barrel-vaulted tomb, details of the facade and the lower courses of the blocking wall, the antechamber's mosaic floor, a 4.2-metre long stone slab, and the upper uncovered sections of two female figures. The second and third chambers, not pictured, have not yet been explored . During initial observations, the archaeologists found that the level of sandy soil in the third chamber is lower than in the previous two chambers. The dome structure has been weakened, as a result of losing a large amount of earth, and the researchers found the arched dome of the third chamber is on the verge of collapse, due to 'deep and extensive cracks' on either side. Before the discovery of the Caryatids, it . was feared the ‘incredibly important’ tomb dating to the time of . Alexander the Great had been plundered in antiquity. Last week, archaeologists unearthed two sculpted female figures, known as Caryatids, (pictured) as they dug deeper at the site in the northeast of Greece. The half-bodied statues made of marble have thick hair covering their shoulders and are wearing a sleeved tunic . Archaeologists . excavating an ancient mound in northern Greece (pictured) uncovered the entrance to an important tomb some months ago. It is . believed to have been built at the end of the reign of warrior-king . Alexander the Great and Prime Minister Antonis Samaras described the . discovery as 'extremely important’ Archaeologist said that a hole in the decorated wall, and signs of forced entry, indicated it had been looted. But . the discovery of the female sculptures gave fresh hope that some treasure may have survived, after all. The face of one of the Caryatids is missing (pictured), but both have one hand outstretched to push away tomb raiders . The Caryatids are made of marble and support an inner entrance into the tomb. They feature the same sculpting technique used for the heads and wings of two sphinxes found guarding the main entrance of the tomb last month. ‘The structure of the second entrance with the Caryatids is an important finding, which supports the view that it is a prominent monument of great importance,’ the Culture Ministry said. The face of one of the Caryatids is . missing, while both figures have one hand outstretched in a symbolic . move to push away anyone who would try to violate the tomb. Archaeologists have said that the Amphipolis site appears to be the largest ancient tomb ever discovered in Greece at 1,935ft (590m) wide. Last month, pictures emerged of a pair of sphinxes guarding the grave's main entrance beneath a large arch and experts said that most of the earth around the mythical creatures had been removed to reveal part of a marble lintel with frescoes. Chief archaeologist Katerina Peristeri said that the monument being uncovered is a unique tomb, not just for Greece but for the entire Balkanic peninsula, and described it as being of ‘global interest’. Archaeologists were hopeful that an ancient mound in northern Greece could hold the remains of a senior official from the time of Alexander the Great. They discovered that its entrance is guarded by a pair of sphinxes (pictured) but last month warned that signs of forced entry indicate it was plundered in antiquity . Alexander (statue pictured) was born in Pella, the ancient capital of Macedonia in July 356 BC, and died of a fever in Babylon in June 323 BC . Alexander III of Macedon was born in Pella, the ancient capital of Macedonia in July 356 BC. He died of a fever in Babylon in June 323 BC. Alexander led an army across the Persian territories of Asia Minor, Syria and Egypt claiming the land as he went. His greatest victory was at the Battle of Gaugamela, now northern Iraq, in 331 BC, and during his trek across these Persian territories, he was said to never have suffered a defeat. This led him to be known as Alexander the Great. Following this battle in Gaugamela, Alexander led his army a further 11,000 miles (17,700km), founded over 70 cities and created an empire that stretched across three continents. This covered from Greece in the west, to Egypt in the south, Danube in the north, and Indian Punjab to the East. Alexander was buried in Egypt. His fellow royals were traditionally interred in a cemetery near Vergina, far to the west. The lavishly-furnished tomb of Alexander's father, Philip II, was discovered during the 1970s. Prime . Minister Antonis Samaras added the discovery ‘is clearly extremely important’. Alexander, . who started from the northern Greek region of Macedonia to build an . empire stretching as far as India, died in 323 B.C. and was buried in . Egypt. His . fellow royals were traditionally interred in a cemetery near Vergina, . to the west, where the lavishly-furnished tomb of Alexander's father, . Philip II, was discovered during the 1970s. Greece's culture ministry said that earth around the sphinx statues has been removed to reveal part of a marble lintel with frescoes (pictured) but hopes of finding further treasures now seem to be slim . The tomb is situated in Amphipolis region of Serres in Greece (marked). Archaeologists believe the grave may have belonged to a senior ancient official. While it looks largely undisturbed, there are fears that looting took place hundreds of years ago . In Greek tradition, the mythical sphinx has the haunches of a lion, sometimes with the wings of a great bird, and the face of a human - usually a woman. It was described by writers as being treacherous and merciless. In many myths, including Oedipus, those who could not answer a riddle posed by the monster, would be killed and eaten. The sphinx described by the Ancient Egyptians was usually male and more benevolent. In both cultures, they often guarded entrances to temples and important tombs. The oldest sphinx found guarding a site was discovered in Turkey and dates to 9,500 BC. But . archaeologists believe the Amphipolis grave, which is surrounded by a . surprisingly long and well-built wall with courses of marble . decorations, may have belonged to a senior ancient official. Dr . Peristeri argued the mound was originally topped by a large stone . lion that was unearthed a century ago, and is now situated around 3 . miles (5km) from the excavation site. Geophysical teams have identified there are three main rooms within the huge circular structure. In . the past, the lion has been associated with Laomedon of Mytilene, one . of Alexander's military commanders who became governor of Syria after . the king's death. ‘The excavation will answer the crucial question of who was buried inside,’ Mr Samaras said. Archaeologists who fear that few treasures and clues to its owner may remain in the tomb, said that part of a stone wall that blocked off the subterranean entrance was found to be missing, while the sphinxes, which were originally six feet (two metres) high, lack heads and wings. Excavator Katerina Peristeri has argued the mound was originally topped by a large stone lion that was unearthed a century ago, and is now situated around 3 miles (5km) from the excavation site (pictured). The lion has been associated with Laomedon of Mytilene, who was one of Alexander's military commanders .","The tomb is situated in the Amphipolis region of Serres in Greece .

"Some witnesses said Michael Brown had been shot in the back. Another said he was face-down on the ground when officer Darren Wilson finished him off. Still others acknowledged changing their stories to fit published details about the autopsy or admitted that they did not see the shooting at all. A review of thousands of pages of grand jury documents reveals numerous examples of statements made during the shooting investigation that were inconsistent, fabricated or provably wrong. Scroll down for video . A review of thousands of pages of grand jury documents has revealed numerous examples of statements that were inconsistent, fabricated or simply inaccurate in relation to the August 9 shooting of Michael Brown . For one, the autopsies ultimately showed Brown was not struck by any bullets in his back. Prosecutors exposed these inconsistencies before the jurors, which likely influenced their decision not to indict Wilson in Brown's death. Bob McCulloch, the St. Louis County prosecutor, said the grand jury had to weigh testimony that conflicted with physical evidence and conflicting statements by witnesses as it decided whether Wilson should face charges. 'Many witnesses to the shooting of Michael Brown made statements inconsistent with other statements they made and also conflicting with the physical evidence. Some were completely refuted by the physical evidence,' McCulloch said. The decision on Monday not to charge Wilson with any crime set off more violent protests in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson and around the country, fueled by claims that the unarmed black 18-year-old was shot while surrendering to the white officer in the mostly African-American city. What people thought were facts about the August 9 shooting have become intertwined with what many see as abuses of power and racial inequality in America. In a clip played for the grand jury, Dorian Johnson, right, said that Officer Wilson had fired at least one shot at his friend while Brown was running away - something which the autopsies showed not to be true. Johnson is pictured above with his attorney James Williams (left) And media coverage of the shooting's aftermath made it into the grand jury proceedings. Before some witnesses testified, prosecutors showed jurors clips of the same people making statements on TV. Their inconsistencies began almost immediately after the shooting, from people in the neighborhood, the friend walking with Brown during the encounter and even one woman who authorities suggested probably wasn't even at the scene at the time. Jurors also were presented with dueling versions from Wilson and Dorian Johnson, who was walking with Brown during the Aug. 9 confrontation. Johnson painted Wilson as provoking the violence, while Wilson said Brown was the aggressor. But Johnson also declared on TV, in a clip played for the grand jury, that Wilson fired at least one shot at his friend while Brown was running away: 'It struck my friend in the back.' One woman testified that she saw Brown leaning through Officer Darren Wilson's car window - but then admitted she suffers from mental disorder, has racist views and trouble distinguishing the truth from things she had read online . Johnson held to a variation of this description in his grand jury testimony, saying the shot caused Brown's body to 'do like a jerking movement, not to where it looked like he got hit in his back, but I knew, it maybe could have grazed him, but he definitely made a jerking movement.' Other eyewitness accounts also were clearly wrong. One woman, who said she was smoking a cigarette with a friend nearby, claimed she saw a second police officer in the passenger seat of Wilson's vehicle. When quizzed by a prosecutor, she elaborated: The officer was white, 'middle age or young' and in uniform. She said she was positive there was a second officer - even though there was not. Another woman testified that she saw Brown leaning through the officer's window 'from his navel up,' with his hand moving up and down, as if he were punching the officer. But when the same witness returned to testify again on another day, she said she suffers from mental disorder, has racist views and that she has trouble distinguishing the truth from things she had read online. One witness told a federal investigator that he saw an officer with a gun drawn and Brown 'on his knees with his hands in the air' before later admitting he hadn't seen the shooting . Prosecutors suggested the woman had fabricated the entire incident and was not even at the scene the day of the shooting. Another witness had told the FBI after the shooting that he saw Wilson shoot Brown in the back and then stand over his prone body to finish him off. But in his grand jury testimony, this witness, acknowledged that he had not seen that part of the shooting, and that what he told the FBI was 'based on me being where I'm from, and that can be the only assumption that I have.' The witness, who lives in the predominantly black neighborhood where Brown was killed, also acknowledged that he changed his story to fit details of the autopsy that he had learned about on TV. 'So it was after you learned that the things you said you saw couldn't have happened that way, then you changed your story about what you seen?' a prosecutor asserted. 'Yeah, to coincide with what really happened,' the witness replied. Another man, describing himself as a friend of Brown's, told a federal investigator that he heard the first gunshot, looked out his window and saw an officer with a gun drawn and Brown 'on his knees with his hands in the air.' He added: 'I seen him shoot him in the head.' But when later pressed by the investigator, the friend said he had not seen the actual shooting because he was walking down the stairs at the time and instead had heard details from someone in the apartment complex. 'What you are saying you saw isn't forensically possible based on the evidence,' the investigator told the friend. Shortly after that, the friend asked if he could leave. 'I ain't feeling comfortable,' he said.","A review of thousands of pages of grand jury documents reveals numerous examples of statements made that were inconsistent or provably wrong .

"Death crash: Illegal immigrant Iqbal Singh, 39, was driving without a licence when he killed father-of-four Malcolm Anderson in a motorway accident . An illegal immigrant who escaped before he could be deported went on to cause the death of a father after falling asleep at the wheel. Indian-born Iqbal Singh, 39, absconded after being refused permanent leave to remain in the UK following his arrival in 2000. He was driving a van without a licence or insurance when he crashed into father-of-four Malcolm Anderson’s car on the M6 last December. Yesterday the electrician’s widow told of her anger after the illegal driver was jailed for just two years over the crash which also left her and son Jason, 13, badly hurt. Deborah Anderson, 50, said: ‘Singh will walk free in a few months while we have been given a life sentence. ‘Armed robbers sometimes get life because they use weapons. The van driven by Singh was the weapon used to kill my husband.’ Singh admitted causing Mr Anderson’s death by careless driving and faced a maximum five-year jail term when he appeared at Warwick Crown Court for sentencing earlier this week. But Judge Michael Cullum reduced the sentence to credit Singh for his early guilty plea over the crash, which happened when the Andersons were returning home to Stechford, Birmingham, in convoy after a family wedding. Warwick Crown Court heard Singh swerved to avoid a car carrying their three daughters, Sarah, 23, Emma, 20 and Michelle, 18, but hit Mr Anderson’s Ford Escort. The car careered into a concrete post and overturned. Mr Anderson died of a heart attack at the scene. Mrs Anderson, who was cut free from the wreckage, had a punctured lung and cracked ribs. Jason suffered a broken nose, a damaged ankle and bruises on his lung. Singh, from Birmingham but of no fixed address, was uninjured in the incident on the northbound carriageway of the M6 near Coventry. He said he had either shut his eyes for a second or taken his eyes off the road. Final picture: Malcolm Anderson (right) at a relative's wedding hours before he was killed. He is pictured with (from left to right) his wife Deborah, daughter Sarah, 23, niece Laura Langbird who was getting married and daughters Emma, 20, and Michelle, 18. His son Jason, then 13, is also pictured (front) Talbir Singh, defending, said Singh had expressed his remorse in letters to the judge and Mr Anderson’s family. Singh was originally charged with causing death by dangerous driving, which carries a maximum sentence of 14 years, but pleaded guilty to the lesser charge on Monday. He also admitted causing death while unlicensed and uninsured. Deborah and Malcolm on their wedding day in 1984. Deborah, 50, and their son Jason, were in the car and were both badly hurt in the crash with Deborah spending four days in hospital . Gail Adams, UK Border Agency regional director, said: ‘Iqbal Singh did not enter the UK illegally. He was given limited leave to remain when he entered in 2000 and then applied for permanent leave to remain which was rejected. But before he could be removed he absconded.’ Singh will be deported to India at the end of his jail term.

"Jailed: Illegal immigrant Eduard Mereohra, 26, ran away from the scene after ploughing into David and Dorothy Metcalf's car on New Year¿s Day . The family of a couple killed by an illegal immigrant drink-driver have blamed Britain’s shambolic border controls. Failed asylum seeker Eduard Mereohra, 26, was kicked out of the country in 2009 but slipped back in just months later. On New Year’s Day, still drunk from a party the night before, he ploughed into a car carrying grandparents David and Dorothy Metcalf, killing them both and tearing a loving family apart. Yesterday, after he was jailed for nine years, the couple’s family said they would still be alive today if the immigration system had not let them down. They demanded an official investigation into how the Moldovan national was able to make a mockery of our border controls. The court was told that Mereohra had even obtained a work permit and national insurance number under his real name, but last night this was disputed by the Home Office and the Department for Work and Pensions. Outside court the couple’s son Clive said: ‘Mum and Dad were hard-working, honest taxpayers who had planned responsibly for their retirement and should have had 20-plus more years to enjoy together. ‘While we hold Mereohra responsible for his actions, we feel that our beloved mum and dad would still be alive today if the system had not failed by allowing him to be at liberty in the UK. ‘We were a very close family and we are lost without them. No sentence will ever be long enough for the person who changed our lives for ever on New Year’s Day 2012, when he took away our parents and our children’s grandparents, through his thoughtless, dangerous and illegal actions.’ Mereohra arrived in Britain in October 2008, and claimed asylum the following year. His claim was refused and he was removed to Austria, where he had earlier claimed asylum, in December 2009.But in April 2010 he sneaked back  into this country in a lorry driven by a Romanian. Victims: David and Dorothy Metcalf were 'hardworking, honest taxpayers who had planned responsibly for their retirement', their son said . Crash: The Metcalfs' Fiatwas lifted into the air after it was hit by Mereohra's Volvo on the Stanningley by-pass Leeds . At the time of the crash he was living in Burley, Leeds, and working as a labourer. On New Year’s Day, still drunk on beer, whisky and champagne from a party the night before, he took the wheel of  his Volvo C70. Witnesses described him driving at high speed along a dual carriage- way outside Leeds, tailgating and forcing other motorists to swerve out of the way. He ploughed into the back of the Metcalfs’ Fiat Panda at around 100mph, hurling it 10ft into the air and flipping it end over end. Mr Metcalf, 68, from Leeds, who was driving, was thrown from the vehicle and died instantly. His 65-year-old wife was found hanging out of a rear window and died later. Immigrants graphics . Mereohra, who was twice the legal drink drive limit, tried to run away but was restrained by a bystander. Later he tried to blame the incident on Mr Metcalf, a retired maintenance engineer. Yesterday at Leeds Crown Court he was sentenced to nine years for causing death by dangerous driving, which he admitted at an earlier hearing. Passing sentence, Judge Geoffrey Marson said Mereohra had made a ‘deliberate decision to drive aggressively’ and had used his car like a weapon. Angry: David and Dorothy Metcalf's son Clive said his parents would still be alive but for the failure of immigration officials . Afterwards Clive Metcalf said: ‘We have been told that he is sorry, but we simply cannot accept that as a genuine apology. ‘He chose to come to this country illegally; he chose to drink all night and get behind the wheel of his car; he chose to drive erratically and at extremely high speed, weaving in and out of traffic; he chose to flee the scene of this horrific incident and denied being the driver and refused to be tested for alcohol. ‘Given those circumstance, we think the only thing he is sorry about is that he was caught.’ The family’s MP Greg Mulholland called for a full investigation of the ‘catalogue of failures’ in the case. The Lib Dem member for Leeds North West said Mereohra had been caught speeding just weeks before the incident ‘but nothing was flagged up’ and he was able to continue driving. He said: ‘The simple fact is that if these deeply concerning errors had not occurred, Mereohra would not have been in this country, let alone driving on our roads, and David and Dorothy Metcalf would have still been with us today. ‘Although he has been sentenced to nine years, it is likely he will only serve half of that and will then be deported.’ The court was told Mereohra had obtained a work permit and national insurance number, although officials could last night find no trace of him in Government records. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We can confirm that Mereohra  has never held permission to work in the UK.‘He is not an European Economic Area national, and he has never been granted any leave (as a person subject to control under the 1971 Immigration Act) from which he would qualify either to claim benefits or seek employment.’A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: ‘We can  find no record of this man on our NI records.‘We will investigate to see if he did obtain an NI number and whether it was by fraudulent means.’ Horrific: Police said the case illustrated the 'terrible consequences' of a motorist driving dangerously at speed while drunk .","Moldovan immigrant Eduard Mereohra was deported from Britain in 2009, but was able to re-enter the country and obtain an NI number and work permit .
He was 'very drunk' when his Volvo ploughed into the back of David and Dorothy Metcalf’s Fiat on New Year’s Day .

"A sadistic killer who wielded a ‘caveman’s club’ is facing life behind bars for battering two pensioners to death and attacking five other strangers in a month of random violence. Ali Koc, 30, beat his victims with lumps of wood, before head butting, punching and kicking them in a series of attacks in parks across north London. He was found guilty today of the two murders and five other attacks on men who were either out jogging or dog walking. Sadistic: Ali Koc, left, is facing a life sentence for battering Victor Parsons and another pensioner to death using lumps of wood. Koc also attacked five others during a month of random violence . Following the verdict police said they police said they feared Koc may have attacked others in his rampage of violence and appealed for any other victims to come forward. The court had head that the Turkish killer stalked the parks and woodland near his home in Hornsey, north London wearing a pair of gloves emblazoned with a skull and cross bones logo. Victor Parsons, 67, died seven weeks after he was battered by Koc with a branch shaped like a ‘caveman’s club’ in Alexandra Park. Keith Needell, 84, died six months after being beaten by Koc in Queen’s Wood. The judge Mr Justice David Calvert-Smith adjourned sentence until Friday morning. Koc was born in Turkey but came to his country in his early teens and lived with his parents, while claiming benefits. Their home in Hornsey was only minutes away from the parks where Koc viciously assaulted his victims. He was well known to staff at his local Job Centre and had vented his frustrations towards them aggressively over the phone. One of these calls to the Department of Work and Pensions was made only half an hour before the attack on Mr Parsons. Victim: Victor Parsons in hospital seven weeks before he died as a result of being attacked by Ali Koc in a north London park with a branch shaped like a 'caveman's club' He was known to police and had previously been jailed for possession of a knife in 2008, and burglary in 2007. Koc had a long criminal record, which included ABH, common assault, theft and possession of cannabis. As the verdicts were said his sister held her hand to her face, while his mother and brother stared blankly. 'There can be no doubt that Koc is a highly dangerous and predatory individual who derived some warped sense of gratification from carrying out these abhorrent attacks.' Detectve Chief Inspector Tim Duffield . Koc remained emotionless throughout. Brian Altman, QC, prosecuting, had described the random attacks as ‘violence for violence sake.’ He said: ‘Over the course of four weeks in January last year, men aged between 29 to 85 were violently and indiscriminately attacked in parks and woodland in north London. ‘Each man was beaten by a male assailant by head butting, punches, kicks and blows with heavy lumps of wood. ‘All of these attacks took place within 2.5km of this defendants address, in parks and woods that we say were very familiar to him.' Mr Altman said none of the victims were robbed, or had items demanded from them, and there was no sexual motivation behind the attack. Defenceless: Keith Needell, 84, who was attacked in north London on January 31 on his way home from researching his family tree and died six months later from his injuries . He said: ‘This was violence for violence sake, committed by the same man, in the same geographical area.' The court had heard that Koc was identified on CCTV near the attacks wearing white Slazenger trainers. The shoes were also found to have distinctive traces of blood and DNA from the victims on them. He was also identified in ID parades by his victims who survived his frenzied attacks. Mr Parsons he lived on his own and regularly walked to Alexandra Park. Mr Altman said: ‘He was known locally as a bit of an eccentric, and was known to be a recluse. ‘On Wednesday mornings he was in the habit of walking from his flat to Alexandra Park and back. ‘It was this routine that was to cost him his life, as it was Wednesday the 5th of January that he left his flat to take his routine walk. ‘On his walk he was repeatedly struck over the head with a blunt object which was almost certainly a lump of wood.' Mr Altman showed the jury the four foot branch recovered from the crime scene with Mr Parsons’ blood on it. A police forensic scientist described the wood as ‘thin at one end and thicker at the other, similar to a cave man’s club’, the court heard. Mr Parsons was carrying £750 in cash in his pocket, but not a penny was taken by his attacker, the court heard. Mr Needell who was attacked on January 31 on his way home from researching his family tree at the Islington Family Records Centre. He was spotted on CCTV at Highgate station as he heard towards Queen’s Wood some 200 metres away from where another man had been attacked by Koc three days earlier. Mr Needell was discovered by dog walkers in the woods with severe facial fractures and a fractured skull. The two pieces of bloodstained wood had once been part of the same branch which had snapped with the force of the impact. ‘Keith is greatly missed by all his family, friends and those whose lives he touched and enriched. 'Such a kind and gentle man should never have suffered in such a brutal and senseless manner. Keith Needell's wife Mary . Koc was arrested two days later on February 2. He denied all of the attacks except one, which he claimed was self defence. Senior Investigating Officer, Detective Chief Inspector Tim Duffield, said: ‘We must not lose sight of the most important people in this case, the victims of Koc and the bereaved families of Victor Parsons and Keith Needell.  ‘The dignity and courage they have shown has been most humbling. Koc has never shown any remorse for this wanton spate of attacks. ‘This was simply violence for violence sake, randomly-inflicted upon law abiding people who happened to be walking or jogging through their local parks. ‘There can be no doubt that Koc is a highly dangerous and predatory individual who derived some warped sense of gratification from carrying out these abhorrent attacks.' Victor Parsons’s sister Rosemary, said: ‘He was a good brother who stoodby me when I needed him. He will be sadly missed.’ Keith Needell’s wife, Mary Needell said: ‘Keith is greatly missed by all his family, friends and those whose lives he touched and enriched. 'Such a kind and gentle man should never have suffered in such a brutal and senseless manner. ‘In 57 years of marriage he never once uttered a cross word. His aim in life was to help others and contribute towards a better life for all.' Koc, of Hornsey, London, had denied two counts of murder, and five counts of attempting to cause GBH.

"The Seattle Seahawks have revealed that a good part of their defensive strategy at the Super Bowl came from the fact that they were able to decode Peyton Manning's hand signals on the field. Controversial corner back Richard Sherman said that he and his fellow defenders cracked the code that the Denver Broncos quarterback was using, meaning that they knew exactly what to expect for each play. 'We knew what route concepts they liked on different downs, so we jumped all the routes. Then we figured out the hand signals for a few of the route audibles in the first half,' he said. Scroll down for video . Cracking the code: The Seattle defense allegedly figured out what plays were associated with each of Peyton Manning's calls, meaning that they were able to prepare for them precisely each play . Reading the field: Manning reportedly changes his hand signals each game, but Seahawks' corner back Richard Sherman said that they were able to break the code during the first quarter of the Super Bowl . Not change enough: Though he only said 'Omaha' twice during the game, he did stick to his same hand signals throughout, meaning that the Seahawks were able to use their cracked code in all four quarters . If true, that would explain why the Broncos had so much trouble scoring, getting their only points on the board in the third quarter. 'All we did was play situational football,' Sherman told Sports Illustrated's blog The MMQB (The Monday Morning Quarterback). 'Me, Earl (Thomas), Kam (Chancellor)... we’re not just three All-Pro players. We’re three All-Pro minds.' The Stanford-educated football player, . who took criticism and was fined for his self-agrandizing speech . following the NFC Championship playoff game, later described the Super . Bowl as 'playing chess, not checkers'. Victorious: Richard Sherman got hurt during the game, but that didn't stop him from celebrating afterwards . New title: The Super Bowl loss means that Manning has taken over the title of 'most post season losses by a quarterback' which was previously held by Brett Favre . Manning's hand signals are known . within the league for being one of his common traits on the field, just . as the call 'Omaha' is associated with the 37-year-old. Manning . is so closely associated with 'Omaha' that 15 companies pledged to . donate $1,500 to charity each time that he said it during the Super . Bowl. Instead of his typical double digit mentions, he only said it twice during Sunday night's big game. (By comparison, Fox Sports reported that he said it 31 times during the AFC title game.) In . post game interviews, however, Manning and other Broncos offensive . linemen explained that the noise at MetLife stadium stopped some of . their verbal messages to one another. Hero's welcome: The Seahawks arrived back Monday ahead of the Wednesday parade in their honor . Home ground: Sherman, who is now on crutches, and the team arrived back in Seattle Monday morning . 'None of us heard the snap count,' Denver offensive lineman Manny Ramirez said. 'I thought I did and when I snapped it, I guess Peyton was actually trying to walk up to me at the time. I'm not 100 per cent sure. It's unfortunate things didn't go as planned.' As for the hand signals, Manning is said to change them every game but this time the other team was paying very close attention early on, explaining how they were able to thwart his plans in the first quarter. The other problem that plagued Manning was that he didn't switch up the system after realizing that it wasn't working. 'Now, if Peyton had thrown in some double moves, if he had gone out of character, we could’ve been exposed,' Sherman said.","Controversial defensive corner back Richard Sherman said that he and the other defenders were able to 'crack the code' on Manning's hand signals .

It's perhaps unsurprising that the U.S. is carrying out the majority of the missions since it is the country with the biggest military, including about 4,800 attack and fighter plains and more than 13,600 other aircraft. That's compared to just 50 fight planes operated by the Royal Bahraini Air Force. Though the U.S. is leading the effort, little has been released by the Pentagon about the missions, including the accuracy of the strikes. In a recent interview with the New York Times, Oklahoma Senator James Inhofe, a senior Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, raised questions about how effective the campaign against IS has been. 'We need more targeting capability,' Inhofe said. Overnight,  the coalition carried out as many as 30 airstrikes in and near Raqqa, it was revealed. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the air strikes hit Islamic State positions in the northern outskirts of Raqqa city, including the 17th Division, a Syrian army base IS seized in July. The monitoring group gathers information on the strikes from activists on the ground in Syrua, who reported at least 30 strikes. The U.S.-led coalition began bombing Islamic State in Syria in September. Syria's nearly four-year-old civil war has continued unabated throughout the country. The Observatory said 19 people were killed including seven women and two children when Syrian government warplanes struck the town of Jassim in the southern province of Deraa on Sunday. Dozens of others were wounded and the death toll was expected to rise because a number were in critical condition, the Observatory said. Fighting also continued in the Kurdish town of Kobani, northwest of Raqqa on the border with Turkey, where Kurdish defenders have been holding off an assault by Islamic State fighters for more than two months. At least 62 people have been killed in fighting in Kobani, known as Ayn al-Arab in Arabic, since early on Saturday, the Observatory said.","New Pentagon report shows U.S. has carried out 819 airstrikes against the Islamic State, compared to just 157 from 10 other countries .

"The family of a woman who was allegedly stabbed to death by her husband wept today as dramatic CCTV footage was played in court, showing the accused in blood-stained clothes carrying her three-year-old daughter and a kitchen knife from the murder scene . Turkish Ensar Gol stabbed his English bride Michala and her mother to death hours after posting a message on Facebook saying the pair would be cut, prosecutors have claimed. The 22-year-old then picked up his wife’s young daughter and walked through the night-time streets, still brandishing the murder weapon, to a pizza restaurant, jurors have heard. Chilling footage: Ensar Gol carries the three-year-old girl in one hand and the knife in the other . Jurors heard that before the killing spree, Gol wrote on Facebook: ‘Have a look, all the English papers will talk about me tomorrow. The crazy wolf Turkish Turk who covered London in blood. The knife is ready, you know I’m handy with a knife.' It is claimed that just hours after posting the message, Gol returned to home and stabbed his sleeping wife Michala to death in their marital bed. His mother-in-law, Julie Sahin and family friend, Casey Wilson, who were watching TV downstairs, rushed to Michala’s aid and found Gol perched over her repeatedly plunging the knife into her neck. Dangerous: He approached the fast food pizza restaurant and on the CCTV footage he could be seen putting down the youngster, before making an animated phone call, with the blade still grasped in his hand . Back down: Eventually as police arrive he throws away the weapon before lying face down on the ground, arms stretched out in front of him . Captured: Ensar Gol  is cuffed and arrested in Thame Town Centre . On trial: Ensar Gol smiles being led into court in September, 2011 . Ms Wilson, aged 19 years, managed to pull the Turkish-born restaurant worker off her 28-year-old friend but was herself stabbed multiple times. She managed to flee from the house but tragically Mrs Sahin was trapped in the bedroom with her knife-wielding son-in-law. Prosecutor Dafydd Enoch told the jury that Gol repeatedly stabbed Mrs Sahin, again targeting her neck. He said she put up a struggle but was found at the bottom of the stairs in a pool of blood, by paramedics. Along with the CCTV footage of his movement on the night, an audio recording of a 999 call by a shocked neighbour in the early hours of September 4 was played. The crackling sound of the witness’ voice could be heard saying: 'Please, please, my neighbour - this man is beating the crap out of this women and they’ve got kids.' The panicked caller added: 'Sorry, I’m shaking because my next door neighbour’s getting beaten up bad.' The lone figure of Gol could be seen on the CCTV video walking quickly through empty streets clutching the girl to his chest and brandishing a blade in the other hand. The restaurant worker entered an open square in the town centre where he approached the fast food pizza restaurant. The court has previously heard he told his father-in-law Mehmet Sahin, was working there: 'You didn’t believe me but I done it.' On the CCTV footage he could be seen putting down the youngster, who initially tried to follow him as he walked away from the shop. However, he beckoned her back before making an animated phone call, with the blade still grasped in his hand. Tragedy: Ensar Gol is accused of the murders of his new wife Michaela, left, and her mother, Julie Sahin, right, in Thame, Oxfordshire . He was then heard saying in Turkish on a mobile phone: 'I told you I’d cut them, didn’t I? Would I lie to you?' An unsuspecting smoker at one stage even walked up to ask for a light before seeing the knife and hurrying away, the court heard. Detective Sergeant Phil Jones, of Thames Valley Police, explained: 'He goes up, sees the knife and thinks better of it.' Eventually as police arrive he throws away the weapon before lying face down on the ground, arms stretched out in front of him, where he is arrested, in Thame Town Centre. Mr Enoch told the jury that Gol had been unhappy in the marriage, after getting wed to Michala following a holiday romance in his native Turkey in March 2011. Newlyweds: Mother-of-two Michala Gol, 28, pictured with Ensar Gol, who is accused of her murder . The prosecuter said that Gol had met up with another woman in a pub and had sex with her on the evening of the killings. He later returned home where he messaged a friend on Facebook and said he would 'cut the lot of them tonight.' He also posted in Turkish: 'I will cut the mother-in-law and wife, brother,' before bragging about being in the newspapers, said Mr Enoch. He revealed that Gol and Michala met in Turkey whilst she was on holiday and she soon fell pregnant. Gol moved to England to be with her and their son and they married soon after. He said Gol had never been happy or settled in the UK and the relationship was rocky with lots of arguments. He added that his relationship with Mrs Sahin had been 'very strained.' Gol, who worked at Prezzo restaurant, moved back to Turkey on several occasions during the short marriage but always returned because of the two children, who cannot be named for legal reasons. Mr Enoch said that in the course of one of the separations Michala had sexual relations with a past boyfriend and Gol had found out about it which caused several arguments. Online: Jurors heard that before the killing spree, Gol wrote on Facebook: 'Have a look, all the English papers will talk about me tomorrow. The crazy wolf Turkish Turk who covered London in blood. The knife is ready, you know I¿m handy with a knife' In opening the prosecution case, he said: 'You can imagine the scene which greeted the paramedics. 'It was something which resembled a scene from an X-rated horror film. 'He walked to the town centre carrying the knife he had just used to kill his wife and mother-in-law. 'He wandered around on the street talking on his mobile phone. 'He was heard to say: ‘The woman married to me will have to do what I say or this will happen.’ 'He was controlled and calculated before the killings, during the killings and in the aftermath of the killings,” said Mr Enoch. 'This was a deliberate attack by the defendant, one that when he came into that house for the last time he intended to do.' Gol denies the charges - he faces two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder. The trial continues.

"A team of British computer hackers as young as 16 who call themselves ‘Isis’ were today facing extradition to the US for allegedly threatening to carry out school massacres. Investigators suspect three people in the UK - two of whom are said to be in Scotland - are linked to more than 12 hoax calls threatening mass murder, hostage taking and the release of poisonous gas. The calls made on Skype are believed to have cost US authorities more than £600,000 ($1million) in emergency response units - and the UK gang members face up to 15 years in jail if convicted. Scroll down for video . Under threat: Police sent a bomb squad to deal with threats at the University of Connecticut's admissions building on April 3. It later turned out that this was a hoax . It is unknown if Islamist extremists were behind the hoax calls - or if the name ‘Isis’ was being used by pranksters seeking to spread distrust of Muslims, reported Sunday Times journalist Dipesh Gadher. Investigators are looking into the group’s activities in Britain after an American was arrested earlier this month on charges related to a bomb threat called into the University of Connecticut in April. Matthew Tollis, 21, spilled details about a global group of Xbox gamers behind multiple hoaxes, including a call to the recently re-opened Sandy Hook Elementary School, an FBI document said. MailOnline reported on Friday how Tollis revealed details about 'swatting' with TeAM CrucifiX or Die, a group of gamers who used Skype calls to plant bomb threats and intimidate government officials. Leads for the FBI: American man Matthew Tollis, 21, spilled details about an international group of Xbox gamers behind multiple hoaxes . 'Swatting' is the practice of calling in fake bomb threats to bring Swat and police response against targeted victims. According . to investigators, Tollis first started following two members of the . group on Twitter after being harassed online, believing that following . the two would prevent further abuse. Tollis had been 'pizza bombed,' a . prank where huge numbers of pizzas are delivered to a target's home, and . 'doxed,' which involves publicly revealing private information like . social security numbers and passwords. Investigators say the first . 'swatting' that Tollis participated in was a call to Hebron High School . in Carrollton, Texas, in which the caller said a student was in . possession of a firearm or bomb. As Swat officers arrived at the high . school, members of the group tweeted about the bomb threat, according to . tweets cached and posted on Pastebin, a plain text sharing site. On Twitter, ‘Declaws’ took . responsibility for the bomb threat and 'Inb4mad' posted a screenshot of . the Skype call used to make it. The tweets have since been deleted and . the account for ‘Declaws’ has been deactivated. Tollis told the FBI that he also . participated in bomb threats against two New Jersey high schools, UConn, . Boston University and the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center. Photographs from the Hartford Courant show bomb technicians and heavily armed police responding to the threat at UConn. The Boston Convention and Exhibition . Center in Massachusetts was hosting an exhibition for gamers with . attendance predicted to reach 60,000, when it received a bomb threat. All clear: The group Tollis belonged to was linked by investigators to the scare at UConn, which was cleared after no explosives were turned up . The caller identified himself as Matt . Haag, an Iraqi national 'working for Allah' and said he had planted . plastic explosives around the building the night before. FBI investigators were also able to . confirm the group was responsible for other 'swatting' actions, though . without the participation of Hollis. In . one, a 14-year-old paid a member of the group £18 ($30) through PayPal to . call in a threat against a private residence in Willimantic, . Connecticut. Calling via Skype from Scotland, 'Robert' told police he had shot his mother and was still armed. Several nearby schools were locked down and a dozen officers responded to the scene, which only deescalated when residents inside spotted police and left the home to speak with them. After another threat in Connecticut, the Middlesex County District Attorney's Office sent an administrative subpoena to Twitter asking for subscriber information on an account for ‘Eviljordie’, which Twitter passed on to the user without advanced notice to law enforcement, according to the FBI affidavit. Using Skype, a caller phoned a paralegal from the District Attorney's Office listed on the subpoena, claiming he was 'ordering a hit man' on her. Investigators say in August a member of the group called Sandy Hook Elementary, where a 2012 mass shooting claimed the lives of 20 children and 6 children, and said he was coming with an assault rifle to 'kill all your [expletive].' Tollis is awaiting trial on federal charges and officials said last week the investigation was ongoing.","Investigators suspect three people in the UK are linked to 12+ hoax calls .

"An American model is suing Apple after she claims naked photos were stolen from her iCloud account months before the recent celebgate hack where resulted in nude photos of stars including Jennifer Lawrence and Kate Upton flooding the internet. Joy Corrigan, 20, claims she tried to warn Apple in early July after fearing her account had been hacked when nude photos of her mysteriously leaked online. She says Apple told her she had been the victim of phishing and that she needed to change her password. Scroll down for video . Joy Corrigan, 20, is suing Apple after she claims naked photos were stolen from her iCloud account months before the recent celebgate hack where resulted in nude photos of stars flooding the internet . But just days later her account was hacked again and when she again contacted Apple, she was told the same thing. After naked photos of over 100 actresses, performers and even Olympic athletes were released by a user on anonymous web forum 4Chan on August 31, Apple contacted her and denied any responsibility. Corrigan is now launching a class-action lawsuit against the tech giant because of its ‘crappy security’ and she’s seeking other victims to join her in the lawsuit, reportsTMZ. The victims included the Oscar-winning young actress Jennifer Lawrence, ex-Downton Abbey star Jessica Brown Findlay, Spiderman heroine Kirsten Dunst, busty supermodel Kate Upton and reality TV phenomenon Kim Kardashian. Hacked? Apple has denied that a flaw in the 'Find My iPhone' function (left) of Apple's iCloud service (right) may have helped the anonymous hacker to steal nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence and '100 other celebrities' Downton Abbey starlet Jessica Brown Findlay (left) and actress Jenifer Lawrence (right) were amongst the most high profile celebrities targeted by hackers . Revealing photographs of model Kate Upton were also obtained by hackers . A list of celebrity names published anonymously online mentioned scores more targets including actresses Kate Bosworth and Selena Gomez, singer Rihanna, British models Cara Delevingne and Kelly Brook, and TV presenter Cat Deeley. One video - reportedly showed Brown Findlay, who played Downton’s Lady Sybil, was watched more than a million times online within hours of being posted. The alleged hackers claimed to have stolen the photos and videos from Apple's iCloud - the global system that stores photos and videos recorded on iPhones and other Apple devices. Apple strenuously denies any responsibility for the leaked images. After celebgate, the company issued a statement in which it insisted the leak was not due to a flaw in its iCloud or Find My iPhone systems but the result of the actions of hackers. 'After more than 40 hours of investigation, we have discovered that certain celebrity accounts were compromised by a very targeted attack on user names, passwords, and security questions, a practice that has become all too common on the internet,' the statement read. 'None of the cases we have investigated has resulted from any breach in any of Apple’s systems including iCloud or Find my iPhone.' The statement added that the company was 'continuing to work with law enforcement to help identify the criminals involved.' The FBI is now investigating the hacking.

"When illness forced vets to remove Great Dane Lily’s eyes, the prospects of a fulfilling life didn’t look good. But then no one had reckoned on her pal Maddison stepping in to turn guide dog. The pair have been inseparable for years but now find themselves looking for a new home because their owner could no longer cope. The catch for anyone interested is that the Great Danes come as a package. They have been waiting at the Dogs Trust re-homing centre in Shrewsbury since July. Homeless: Blind Great Dane Lily and her kind-hearted canine carer Maddison . Forever friends:  Lily, left, being guided while walking with Maddison right. The pair have been inseparable since Lily lost her sight . Manager Louise Campbell said: . ‘Maddison is Lily’s guide dog. If they are out and about, for the . majority of the time Maddison will lead and Lily will walk nearly . touching her so she knows where to go. It’s lovely to watch. Maddison is . always looking out for her.’ Lily, six, was barely a puppy when . she was struck down by a condition that caused her eyelashes to grown . into her eyeballs, damaging them beyond repair. It was after this traumatic event that her relationship with seven-year-old Maddison developed as she took her under her wing. The best buddies lived together until their owners decided they couldn't look after them any more. Miss Campbell said: 'With her lack of . sight, Lily's other senses have heightened so although we don't split . them up often she can tell if Maddison is nearby. 'They curl up together to go to sleep and they are very vocal with each other. 'We haven't analysed their different . barks but if Lily wants to go forward and Maddison is in her way, the . bark will have a different pitch. 'They are very close to one another and enjoy each other's company'. Playful: Lily's lack of sight has heightened her other senses so she can often tell if Maddison is nearby without the pair touching . Miss Campbell said that Lily does all . the things normal dogs do and if you saw her from a distance you . wouldn't realise she had anything wrong with her eyes. She added: 'They are really happy with life, the glass is always half full with these two. 'They have been with us for a . considerable amount of time but they are quite happy and go about their . daily routine - they are very affectionate.' She believes the dogs' size and . advancing years, as well as the fact they have to come in a pair, may . have put off potential owners and she warned that anyone contemplating . taking the dogs in should look at their lifestyle and think of the . responsibility involved. 'They are not gigantic when you see . them outside. These are two lovely big girls who deserve to live out the . rest of their lives together in comfort', she said.

"A 10ft Burmese python was found crushed to death under a tree blown down in high winds. RSPCA officials are investigating the death of the snake, found in a park in Northfleet, Kent, on Wednesday by alarmed dog walkers. The reptile had a head injury - but it remains unclear if the wound was suffered before being hit by the tree. Crushed to death: RSPCA officials are now investigating the death of the 10ft snake in Northfleet, Kent . Officers say it is possible the snake was killed and then left at the scene by a cruel owner. An RSPCA spokesman said: ‘Somebody will be missing a 10ft Burmese python and we want to find out who. ‘Further examination of the snake has led to some question as to whether the crush injury it sustained to the head was a result of the tree or whether the injury took place prior to being placed under the tree.’ Nobody has yet come forward to claim ownership of the snake. Average Burmese pythons grow to between 12 and 13ft - although some can reach 25ft and females are usually larger than males. The snakes are normally found in the marshlands, swamps, grasslands and woodland of southern and south-east Asia, and can prove deadly. Location: The snake was found in this park (file picture) in Northfleet, Kent, on Wednesday by dog walkers . The RSPCA spokesman added: ‘A snake of . this size could easily crush a child. A fully-grown one would have the . capability of seriously injuring or even killing a fully grown adult. ‘It’s their crush instinct that’s particularly dangerous.’ Burmese pythons are a brown colour with distinctive black, green and tan markings. 'Somebody will be missing a 10ft Burmese python and we want to find out who' RSPCA spokesman . Despite the potential danger, the creatures - which eat birds, small mammals and rodents - are popular as pets because of their appearance and normally docile manner. They can live for 20 years or more. The largest Burmese pythons can weigh as much as 250lbs. The Guinness World Record for the largest snake in captivity was awarded in 2011 to Medusa, a reticulated python measuring 25ft 2in in length - which was a pet in Kansas City, United States. The 10-year-old snake required 15 men to hold her at full length in order for her record measurement to be taken. The sub-tropical species is one of the five largest in the world and normally found in south-east Asia - but has become a popular pet among reptile enthusiasts in the UK.","RSPCA officials are investigating death of the snake in Northfleet, Kent .

"He treated his 17 sons and daughters like cash cows – generating a staggering benefits income of £60,000 a year. Yesterday, Mick Philpott remained shameless to the last. The drug-taking layabout, who . embodies everything that is wrong with the welfare state, was still . smiling even after being convicted of killing six of his children. Killers: A court drawing shows the moment Mick Philpott, wife Mairead and friend Paul Mosley were found guilty of deliberately starting a fire which claimed the lives of six of the Philpotts's children . Co-conspirators: Mick and Mairead Philpott appeared at a press conference (left) in a tearful ruse to appeal for information after the fire last year. They are pictured (right) on their wedding day in May 2003 . Together with his wife Mairead and . friend Paul Mosley, he plotted to set fire to the family home in an . appalling attempt to frame Philpott’s former live-in lover Lisa Willis. The deadly gamble was to save the six . youngsters, blame Miss Willis, and win back custody of five children . who had recently moved out of the cramped three-bedroom semi with her. A bigger council house was also on . the agenda. As the cynical trio were found guilty at Nottingham Crown . Court of manslaughter, Philpott’s sister-in-law, Bernadette Duffy, . screamed: ‘You murdering b*******.

Yesterday Philpott, 56, shouted . obscenities before saying ‘it’s not over yet’ moments after Mrs Justice . Thirlwall asked for the verdicts to be received in silence ‘out of . respect for the memories’ of the children he had killed. But with typical arrogance, Philpott, . who infamously appeared on the Jeremy Kyle Show to demand a bigger . council house, crossed himself, waved and smiled as he was led away. The court heard how Philpott lived . with his wife, Miss Willis and their combined 11 children in his cramped . three-bedroom council house in Allenton, Derby. Doomed: Firefighters said the children would not have been able to survive the intense heat and thick smoke . Spread rapidly: From the moment the fire was set in the hallway, the flames would have surged up the uPVC front door, melting the plastic, and quickly progressed up the staircase, firefighters said . But he was left irate after Miss . Willis, 29, became disillusioned with his ‘domineering behaviour’ and . summoned the courage to escape the unconventional family home with her . five children early last year. That decision to leave, taking with . her more than £1,000 a month in benefit payments, was the ‘catalyst for . everything that was to follow’. Miss Willis, a cleaner, was due to . face Philpott at a custody hearing just hours after the blaze and . Philpott became the ‘driving force’ of a heinous plan to set her up, the . court heard. Ignited: The door to the hallway where the fire was started with petrol . Fire-starter: A petrol can that was found near the property in Victory Road after the blaze .

He began telling friends she had . threatened his home and his children, something he would ‘use in court . to get his children back’. Less than a fortnight before the fire, he reported to police that she had made a telephone threat to kill him. Philpott calculated that a fire could . also land him a new, bigger council house – something he had been . demanding from the local authority ever since his notorious appearance . on Jeremy Kyle in 2006. No hope: Thick, black smoke would have quickly filled each of the rooms from floor to ceiling, rendering the six children (clockwise from top left) - Duwayne, 13, Jade, 10, John, nine, Jessie, six, Jayden, five, and Jack, eight - unconscious in minutes . Killed by their own parents: Six wooden crosses mark the graves of the Philpott children . Young lives destroyed: The six coffins carrying the Philpotts's children are carried into St Mary's Roman Catholic Church for their funeral last year . Community in shock: Floral tributes adorn the pavement outside the house Philpott shared with Mairead in Allenton, Derby, after the fire on May 14 last year . On May 11 last year, after Philpott . had a sordid sex session with his wife and Mosley on their home snooker . table, the fire was lit, with the intention that the six children . sleeping upstairs would be saved through an upstairs window, with . Philpott both ‘the hero and the victim’. But the idiotic plan went . disastrously wrong.

Petrol on Philpott’s clothing was . also found inside the front door. He simply claimed that fuel was found . because he had not washed for three months. While his wife was seen to be distraught, Philpott was overheard afterwards saying: ‘It wasn’t meant to end like this.’ During a fortnight of surveillance at . the hotel where they were put up by police in May, the couple were . heard whispering about the case, with Philpott recorded telling his wife . to ‘stick to your story’. The couple were charged by police on . May 30 in connection with the deaths and Mosley was arrested in the . months afterwards, having told a friend the plan had been for him to . rescue the children. Police initially charged the trio . with murder but downgraded this to manslaughter because while their . actions were sickeningly reckless, the defendants had not intended to . kill the six. Yesterday Philpott’s sister, Dawn Bestwick, said his family believed ‘justice has been served’. ‘This past year has been a very . difficult time for our family as we have had to come to terms with what . Michael and Mairead and Paul Mosley have done,’ she said. ‘We can now attempt to move on and our six angels can rest in peace.’ Mick Philpott was raking in £60,000 a year as a result of his 'three-way relationship', police say. The cash was paid to both Lisa WIllis and his wife Mairead, both part time cleaners, in working tax credits and child benefit for the total of 11 children they raised with Philpott. Although he was not claiming any benefits himself, the five-figure sum was channeled straight into his bank account as he refused to let the women manage their own financial affairs. During the trial, prosecutor Richard Latham QC said: 'Michael Philpott did not want to work. He just wanted a house full of kids and the benefit money that brings.' The last full-time job Philpott had was in 1991 as a bakery manager. Since then he has done odd jobs for cash, including running pub trips. Mrs Philpott’s family said the . children had been taken away in the ‘cruellest way imaginable by the . very people who were supposed to love and protect them.’ Her sister Bernadette, who was ejected from the courtroom, said she was convinced of the Philpotts’ guilt from the outset. Derbyshire Police said a serious case . review will examine ‘Mairead’s role as a mother’ as well as the extent . of any involvement social services may have had with the family. Andrew Bunyan, of Derby City Council, . said questions would be asked as to ‘whether there are immediate changes . that need to be made to the way local services operate to safeguard . children’. ‘The local safeguarding children board . will review the work of the agencies involved, even if, as in this . case, the children were not subject to child protection plans or legal . orders,’ he added. Derbyshire Assistant Chief Constable Steve Cotterill described the crimes as ‘an evil, stupid, shameful act’. He added that Philpott’s erratic . behaviour since the fire, including a ‘childlike performance’ at the . infamous police press conference, has been nothing more than a ‘sham’.","Mick Philpott treated his children like cash cows generating £60,000 a year in benefits .

"Many of us feel passionately about our choice of condiments, but few could claim to be as obsessed as one woman who eats tomato ketchup at least three times a day. Melissa Ibbitson, 19, just can't get enough of the red sauce and eats ketchup with almost every meal. She loves tomato sauce so much that she has even walked out of a restaurant because they didn't stock it. Melissa just cant get enough ketchup, adding it to almost every meal . Melissa loves tomato sauce so much that she has even walked out of a restaurant because they didn't stock her favourite condiment . The theology student, from Lincoln, has been a ketchup fan her whole life, but her addiction really gathered pace four years ago and she now gets through three bottles a week - which adds up to 11st a year, more than her own body weight. Melissa said: 'I started eating ketchup when I was a kid and we first went to McDonalds. 'I can't remember how it became such an obsession but now I can't live without it. 'My friends get really embarrassed when I ask for 12 sachets for my meals at the student's union, and I'll get extras to take home with me. 'I eat so much of the stuff - I dread to think what it's doing to my body.' With the average bottle of ketchup costing £1.85, the average year's supply sets her back about £300 . The tomato sauce addict says she dare not think about how much she spends on the sauce - but, with the average bottle of ketchup costing £1.85, a year's supply will set her back about £300. She said: 'Heinz tomato sauce is my favourite, but as a student I sometimes can't afford to be picky. 'I would rather have a brand that isn't Heinz than no ketchup at all. 'I pick up sachets anywhere I can - the union, the pub, fast food chains - it's the best way to keep my costs to a minimum.' Melissa's obsession with the sauce has no limits - she had a birthday cake shaped like a ketchup bottle last year and even gets ketchup-themed presents for Christmas. Melissa's obsession has prompted friends to give her ketchup-themed gifts, such as this personalised bottle (right) which she received for her birthday . She owns an 'I love ketchup' tea towel, a personalised ketchup bottle and a ketchup-bottle shaped tin. Melissa said: 'When I lived at home my mum used to get annoyed with me. I would get through the ketchup quicker than she could get to the shop to buy it. 'Since I've moved out and have been making my own meals I've got even worse. 'For breakfast I'll have spaghetti or beans on toast with ketchup, lunch will be a sandwich with ketchup and I have ketchup with whatever I have for dinner.' Although Melissa does like other condiments, she says nothing compares to her love for tomato sauce. She said: 'I like brown sauce and mayonnaise but it's quite rare that I eat that compared to how much ketchup I eat. 'My favourite thing to eat with ketchup is chips - I won't eat them without it.

"Tribunal win: Former BBC IT boss John Linwood has successfully argued he was unfairly dismissed by the corporation over a failed £100m project . A BBC manager who ran a botched IT project that cost the licence fee payer £100million was unfairly dismissed because the corporation plotted to blame him when it was scrapped, an employment tribunal has found. John Linwood, who was paid a salary of £280,000, said he was made a 'scapegoat' and sacked in a 'stitch-up' over the expensive failure last year. The tribunal panel criticised the BBC's 'culture and climate' that involved 'the steering of the spotlight of blame in other directions'. The corporation sacked him claiming he should be treated the same as a 'manager of a relegated football team', but a tribunal decided today this decision was 'cavalier'. The BBC had ploughed £125.9 million into the scheme he managed - an attempt to create an integrated digital production and archiving system. But it was scrapped by current director-general Tony Hall in his first weeks in the job leaving a net cost of £98.4 million. It could now face a payout of as much as £100,000 after the tribunal verdict. The central London tribunal said Mr Linwood's claim he was unfairly dismissed was 'well-founded', but added that he had 'contributed' to his dismissal as well. It rejected two other complaints he made against the corporation. A BBC spokesman said it had been 'a very difficult set of circumstances' for the corporation. He said: 'We had a major failure of a significant project, and we had lost confidence - as the tribunal acknowledges - in John Linwood. At the time we believed we acted appropriately. 'The tribunal has taken a different view - we are disappointed with the outcome, but nevertheless we will learn lessons from the judgment and we're grateful to staff who were involved in dealing with a very difficult case.' Failed project: Mr Linwood was in charge of an £100m project scrapped by director general Tony Hall . Mr Linwood told the hearing that after leaving one meeting about his future, he was told by the BBC's head of strategy, John Tate, that the procedure leading up to his dismissal in July 2013 was 'a stitch up'. It also heard from the BBC's then head of communications Gavin Dawson that Mr Linwood was 'arguably' a scapegoat, but he added that 'is not the way I would characterise it'. In one, a BBC boss, Pat Younge, said Mr Linwood could 'just spin in the wind' while Mr Coles could 'position yourself as the man who took it over, reviewed it and called time'. The tribunal said the emails represented a 'culture and climate' that involved 'the steering of the spotlight of blame in other directions, on the part of those who felt themselves to be in danger of association with a sinking ship'. Evidence: The BBC, which is based at Broadcasting House in London, pictured, made Mr Linwood a scapegoat . It refused to accept the BBC's claim that 'this case was broadly analogous to...the manager of a relegated football team' and said some HR staff behaved at times with 'a cavalier disregard for any of the accepted norms of a fair disciplinary process' by not giving Mr Linwood enough time to study some of the evidence used against him. The tribunal's report revealed Mr Linwood was paid a 'sign-on bonus' of £140,000 on top of his salary within 18 months of starting work at the BBC in 2009. The tribunal ruling is another expensive footnote to the DMI fiasco, which experts predict could cost the Corporation another £100,000. Julie Morris, a partner in employment law at Slater & Gordon, told MailOnline: 'His maximum compensation would be £74,200 assuming he was dismissed before 6 April 2014. 'On top of that, he may also have a claim for his notice - for which he could also recover £25,000 in an Employment Tribunal.'","The 'culture and climate' at the top of the BBC has been criticised .

"A human-like ‘skin’ for aircraft - allowing them to detect any damage and ‘feel’ the world around them - is being developed by British experts. Engineers at BAE Systems’ Advanced Technology Centre are investigating a ‘smart skin’ concept which could be embedded with tens of thousands of micro-sensors. When applied to an aircraft, it will enable it to sense wind speed, temperature, physical strain and movement, far more accurately than current sensor technology allows. Scroll down for audio interview discussing the project . BAE Systems in Essex has revealed a new technology for aircraft. A human-like 'skin' will detect damage and 'feel' the world around the plane (illustration shown). The smart skin would be embedded with thousands of micro-sensors. These can sense wind speed, temperature and movement accurately . The revolutionary ‘smart skin’ concept will enable aircraft to continually monitor their health, reporting back on potential problems before they become significant. The US Army has revealed plans to replace tanks with small, 'off road' vehicles covered in smart armour that is more adaptable to modern weaponry. Military bosses says that current tanks are hindering soldier's ability to get into battle. The Ground X-Vehicle Technology (GXV-T) programme, dubbed 'X-planes for tanks', is designed to develop a range of new vehicles. 'GXV-T's goal is not just to improve or replace one particular vehicle - it's about breaking the ""more armor"" paradigm and revolutionizing protection for all armored fighting vehicles,' said Kevin Massey, DARPA program manager. 'Inspired by how X-plane programs have improved aircraft capabilities over the past 60 years, we plan to pursue groundbreaking fundamental research and development to help make future armored fighting vehicles significantly more mobile, effective, safe and affordable.' Engineers say the smart skin system would reduce the need for regular check-ups on the ground and parts could be replaced in a timely manner, increasing the efficiency of aircraft maintenance, the availability of the plane and improving safety. The tiny sensors or ‘motes’ can be as small as grains of rice and even as small as dust particles at less than 0.002 inches squared (one millimetre squared). Collectively, the sensors would have their own power source and when paired with the appropriate software, be able to communicate in much the same way that human skin sends signals to the brain. The sensors are so small that BAE Systems is exploring the possibility of retrofitting them to existing aircraft and even spraying them on like paint. Leading the research and development is Senior Research Scientist Lydia Hyde whose ‘eureka’ moment came when she was doing her washing and observed that her tumble dryer uses a sensor to prevent it from overheating. Engineers say the smart skin system would reduce the need for regular check-ups on the ground and parts could be replaced in a timely manner, increasing the efficiency of aircraft maintenance.The tiny sensors or ‘motes’ (shown) can be as small as grains of rice and even as small as dust particles . She said: 'Observing how a simple sensor can be used to stop a domestic appliance overheating, got me thinking about how this could be applied to my work and how we could replace bulky, expensive sensors with cheap, miniature, multi-functional ones. 'This in turn led to the idea that aircraft, or indeed cars and ships, could be covered by thousands of these motes creating a ""smart skin"" that can sense the world around them and monitor their condition by detecting stress, heat or damage. 'The idea is to make platforms ""feel"" using a skin of sensors in the same way humans or animals do. 'By combining the outputs of thousands of sensors with big data analysis, the technology has the potential to be a game-changer for the UK industry. 'In the future we could see more robust defence platforms that are capable of more complex missions whilst reducing the need for routine maintenance checks. 'There are also wider civilian applications for the concept which we are exploring.' The research is part of a range of new systems being investigated by BAE Systems under a major programme exploring next-generation technology for air platforms.","BAE Systems in Essex has revealed a new technology for aircraft .

"Four-year-old Fae Platten from Essex  lost consciousness on a plane after a selfish passenger ignored three warnings and opened a packet of nuts . A girl aged four suffered a life-threatening allergy attack at 30,000ft after an airline passenger ignored repeated warnings not to eat peanuts. Fae Platten stopped breathing and passed out on a holiday flight after the man opened a packet of mixed nuts despite three warnings that there was a child on board with a severe allergy. The family of the little girl, who went into anaphylactic shock, said yesterday that the ‘incredibly selfish’ passenger had put her life at risk. She had to be revived with an anti-allergy adrenaline injection and was taken to hospital for treatment after the Ryanair plane landed at Stansted. The airline has banned the male passenger from flying with it for two years. Fae’s family had alerted Ryanair about her severe peanut allergy and said cabin crew announced that they would not sell peanuts on board and asked passengers not to open any packets of nuts they already had. But 20 minutes into the flight from Tenerife Fae’s parents Katy and Dean Platten said she began scratching her cheeks and complaining that her face hurt. A man sitting four rows away had apparently ignored the warnings and opened a packet of nuts, causing Fae’s face to swell, her mouth to blister and leaving her struggling to breathe. Although her mother rushed her to the front of the plane, the air conditioning on board meant nut particles were circulated around the flight and Fae passed out. An ambulance worker on board responded to the cabin crew’s call for medically-trained passengers and used Fae’s adrenaline pen – which she carries at all times – to administer an injection which brought her back to consciousness. Mrs Platten, 30, a nursery manager of West Bergholt, Essex, said: ‘I was so scared for Fae. 'There were three very clear warnings to everyone on board yet this man ignored them all. 'He was a dad with teenage children so he should have known better. He was incredibly selfish.' Scroll down for video .

In Tenerife: Fae with her mother Katy during their holiday . Peanuts and tree nuts can cause allergic reactions, which are sometimes severe. A severe reaction to nuts is called anaphylaxis and can be life-threatening. Symptoms often start quickly, within an hour of coming into contact with a nut, and sometimes within minutes. The body's immune system normally fights infection, but when a person is allergic to tree nuts or peanuts, the immune system overreacts to proteins in these foods. Every time the person eats or, in some cases, handles or breathes in a peanut or tree nut, the body thinks the proteins are harmful invaders. The immune system responds by kicking into high gear to fend off the 'invader'. This causes an allergic reaction and symptoms can include: .","Four-year-old Fae Platten stopped breathing on a flight home from Tenerife .

"Amazing natural sights such as the the Grand Canyon or the Northern Lights might increase people's tendency to believe in God and the supernatural, according to new research by US scientists. The findings suggest that awe-inspiring sights increase our motivation to make sense of the world around us, and may underlie a trigger of belief in the supernatural. Psychological scientist Doctor Piercarlo Valdesolo, of Claremont McKenna College in the United States, said: ‘Many historical accounts of religious epiphanies and revelations seem to involve the experience of being awe-struck by the beauty, strength or size of a divine being, and these experiences change the way people understand and think about the world. Heavens above: Researchers claim that gazing upon amazing natural sights such as the Grand Canyon (pictured) can lead to a belief in God . ‘We wanted to test the exact opposite prediction: it's not that the presence of the supernatural elicits awe, it's that awe elicits the perception of the presence of the supernatural.’ Dr Valdesolo and his colleague Jesse Graham, of the University of Southern California, tested the prediction by having participants watch awe-inspiring scenes from BBC's Planet Earth documentary series or neutral video clips from a news interview. Afterwards, the participants were asked how much awe they felt while watching the video, and whether they believed that worldly events unfold according to some god's or other non-human entity's plan. Study: Participants were shown scenes from the BBC's Planet Earth series and asked about religion afterwards. Pictured are the Iguazu Falls in Argentina, which featured in the show . Sneak peak: Participants who watched the awe-inspiring clips became increasingly intolerant of uncertainty . Nature and a connection with the divine has long been observed, perhaps most famously by the Romantics. Romanticism was an artistic, literary, and intellectual movement that began in Europe towards the end of the 18th century and peaked between 1800 and 1850. Artists and philosophers who belonged to the movement emphasised the glory, beauty and power of the natural world. Feeling alienated by traditional religious beliefs, the romantics looked upon nature as the dwelling place of God. God and the natural universe were one and the same. They saw nature as a metaphor for the sublime - the power and mystery of forces that inspired awe, solace and self-discovery. Famous romantic Jean-Jacques Rousseau held that humans were by nature good but were corrupted by society. ‘Natural man’ was close to nature and unspoiled by social institutions. The main reason for the development of this strong connection between nature and God was the Industrial Revolution, which caused many people to leave the countryside and live in cities, separating themselves from the natural world. The connection may also have arisen as a backlash against the scientific trend for enlightenment philosophy. In addition to this, large areas of European and North American wilderness had been tamed, so that it had become much safer for people to travel to natural wonders. Overall, the participants who had watched the awe-inspiring video tended to believe more in supernatural control, and were more likely to believe in God when compared with the news-watching group. The effect held even when awe-inspiring but impossible scenes, such as a massive waterfall through city streets, were presented. Another study showed that participants who watched the awe-inspiring clips became increasingly intolerant of uncertainty. This particular mindset - a discomfort with uncertainty - may explain why feelings of awe produce a greater belief in the supernatural, according to the researchers. Dr Valdesolo said: ‘The irony in this is that gazing upon things that we know to be formed by natural causes, such as the jaw-dropping expanse of the Grand Canyon, pushes us to explain them as the product of supernatural causes.’ However, the researchers also pointed out that the figures could also shed light on why certain individuals seek to explain the world through secular and scientific means. The experience of awe may simply motivate us to search for explanations, no matter what kinds of explanations they are. Dr Valdesolo said this might be why, in another experiment, participants who watched the awe-inspiring video showed greater discomfort and were more likely to believe a random string of numbers was designed by a human hand. Based on their preliminary findings, published in the journal Psychological Science, the researchers are now looking at factors that modulate the effect of awe on belief in the supernatural. For example, they are testing whether adopting submissive body postures, which make us feel less powerful, might dispose us to experiences of awe. Dr Valdesolo said such a link could perhaps explain the presence of such postures in religious practice, such as kneeling, bowing, and gazing up. He added: ‘The more submissive we act, the more awe we might feel, and perhaps the stronger our beliefs become.’","Being awe-struck prompts people to try to explain the world, a study found .

"An Atlantic City casino is cursing its bad luck, and a careless security driver, after it lost a bag of cash worth $21,000. The incident took place during a routine pickup from Revel Casino when the armoured vehicle driver left the cash on the roof of his car and drove off. It is the second bit of bad news in less than a week for the $2.4billion resort, after they announced they are having to close their doors due to money problems. The Revel Casino Hotel in Atlantic City has fallen victim to a careless security card. Security footage shows the bag being placed on the roof of the car by the driver before he drives off onto his next pickup. Unbelievably it is still on the roof when the car pulls up at Resorts Atlantic City, which is about six minutes drive away from Revels, reports Press of Atlantic City. The driver then gets back in his truck and pulls off, yet again failing to notice the cash on his roof. It is unclear where or when the money fell off after that. The Revel Casino has said that responsibility for the loss lies with GardaWorld. (stock photo) The money's route: Incredibly the money survived the six minute drive between the Resorts and Revel casinos . GardaWorld, the armoured vehicle company involved, have opened an investigation. 'We are cooperating with the authorities in investigating this incident and cannot provide any additional details,' said Joe Gavaghan, director of corporate communications. While losing $21,000 would be staggering for most gamblers, it's not a lot compared to Revel's other losses. The casino, completed just two years ago for $2.4 billion, has failed to generate enough business to stay open and filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time in June. It loses about $2 million a week, according to bankruptcy documents. It is not the first time an armoured car has lost the money it is supposed to be transporting. In May, a California man who was working in a parking lot as part of a drug rehabilitation program returned $125,000 that had fallen from one of the vehicles. In 1981, a Philadelphia man found $1.2 million that had fallen from an armored car. Joey Coyle, the unemployed man who found the cash, went on a spending spree, giving cash to friends and strangers alike. He was later acquitted of theft charges for reasons of temporary insanity.","Cash was still on the roof when it stopped at the next pickup address .

"Reverend George Gebauer has described homosexuality as a 'medical issue' saying there was a hormone imbalance . A CHURCH of England vicar refused to christen a baby boy because his lesbian parents both wanted to be registered as his mother. Aimi Leggett, 25, and her civil partner Victoria, 22, had hoped to welcome  one-year-old Alfie into the church with a traditional christening. But Reverend George Gebauer told them it was ‘impossible’ for him to have two mothers – forcing his archdeacon to intervene and give permission for  the  service to go ahead. The 87-year-old from St Mary’s Church in Warsash, Hampshire – who says he ‘feels sorry’ for gay people because they are medically ‘imbalanced’ – refused to conduct the ceremony claiming it could be ‘illegal’ to proceed in the way they wanted. The couple stormed out of the meeting after the vicar suggested that one of  them should be listed as godmother instead because the baptism certificate only has space for one mother and one father. Alfie’s birth mother Aimi said: ‘There was no way one of us was going to be listed as the godparent. We are both Alfie’s mum. ‘Rev Gebauer sat there and told us no child could have parents of the same sex, no child could have two mothers. Civil partners Aimi and Victoria Leggett (pictured on their wedding day) stormed out of the church meeting . The couple wanted St Mary's Church to recognise them both as parents to one-year-old Alfie . ‘He did this for about ten or 15 minutes and was asking us why we want Alfie brought into the church.’ She added: ‘I’m baptised Church of  England and Victoria is a Catholic. We want him to be brought up [Christian] the same that we have been. ‘We were even saying to the Reverend: . “Do you want Alfie to be ashamed of his family?” He’s not gay, we are, . what we do is up to us.’ Full-time mother Aimi and law student . Victoria, who live in the nearby town of Fareham, had initially . organised the baptism with Rev Andy Norris – who has since moved away . from the church. Church: Rev Gebauer is among other clergy standing in for Rev Andy Norris, who has recently left his post as vicar at the Hampshire church . Retired vicars, including Rev Gebauer, are now officiating until a replacement can be found. The pair had chosen St Mary’s as Aimi . herself was baptised there and her parents married there. Rev Gebauer, . who has been a vicar for 40 years, claimed the couple’s sexuality was . not an issue and that he had been willing to baptise Alfie if they . agreed to record just one of them as mother. The vicar, who lives in a £350,000 . bungalow in the nearby village of Locks Heath, added: ‘They insisted . they both be registered as mum and refused to budge from their position. They will not give way and that can’t happen. Their sexuality has no . bearing on the issue. It was never discussed. The church baptism . register makes no provision for it. ‘We have bent over backwards to try . and accommodate this family. I believe it would be illegal for me to . register them both as mother. 'Impossible': Rev Gebauer said there was not the space in the Church of England register for two mothers . ‘The soul of the little boy is more important than anything else but we have a stalemate.’ Victoria said the couple, who both . wore white dresses on their wedding day in 2011, were upset and shocked . by their treatment. She added: ‘It’s so hard not to be put off by our . experience. ‘You get told “yes you can do it” and then that all changes and they completely disregard it. ‘You do not expect a little, frail, old man to say this.’ However, in a last minute u-turn the Archdeacon of the Meon, the Ven Gavin Collins, intervened in the row last night. He confirmed that the christening can go ahead without Rev Gebauer – with both women named as mother on the certificate.

"Tomorrow morning, at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month we will, once again, bow our heads throughout the traditional two-minute silence in remembrance of The Fallen. We will honour not just those who died in the First and Second World Wars, but those who lost their lives in many battles over the decades since, including those in the arid deserts of Iraq and in the mountainous terrain of Afghanistan. It is right and just that we should do so, and to remember, too, the countless civilians caught up in wars that were not of their making. Wounded: Marine Joe Townsend lost both his legs in Afghanistan. He was just 19 when he stepped on an improvised explosive device . Sacrifice: Sergeant Rick Clement lost both his legs after stepping on an IED while on patrol in Afghanistan . Cost: Marine Mark Ormrod, left, lost both legs and his right arm after stepping on an IED during a foot patrol in Afghanistan on Christmas Eve. Lieutenant Will Dixon, right, 29, he lost his leg when his vehicle was hit by an IED . Selfless: Sergeant Mark Sutcliffe, left, lost his leg when he was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade during an attack in Iraq. Corporal Simon Brown, right, lost almost his entire eyesight after being hit by a bullet after being called to a broken-down vehicle which was being fired on by insurgents in Iraq . Perhaps, like me, you have questioned these recent conflicts and debated the merits of our involvement in the on-going ‘war on terror’. But whatever our conflicting emotions on the morality of these recent wars we have waged, we acknowledge the debt owed to those who died on the battlefields. Those who sacrificed their lives. Those who selflessly put duty before desire, and honour above home. Those who did what was asked of them. Although I was born in Canada, my father and grandfathers were in the British Army. Both my grandfathers enlisted in the Royal Engineers. That is why Remembrance Day resonates so strongly with me. In 1987 Jim Vallance and I wrote a song called Remembrance Day as a personal tribute to all those who died fighting for freedom. By honouring and commemorating our dead,  we pay homage to those who paid the ultimate price. But tomorrow morning, I urge you to think about another band of brothers who have made a  similar sacrifice. Celebrating veterans: Bryan Adams's book, Wounded: The Legacy of War, will be published tomorrow . They are the soldiers and civilians who suffered life-changing injuries - whether it be the loss of limbs, disfiguring scars or emotional anguish. Those for whom, when the fight on the battlefield ended, the euphoria of survival was swiftly followed by the onset of yet another daunting struggle: that of readjusting and adapting to a world in which many of them feel they can no longer participate fully. The insightful works of many of our great poets such as Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon (both of whom served in the First World War), and the paintings of Frederick Varley, depicted vividly the bloody brutality faced by those who, as Owen graphically described, ‘die like cattle’. Owen’s verses in particular describe candidly the cruel reality of the ‘monstrous anger of the guns’ and the ‘stuttering rifles rapid rattle’. His poems are vivid with flesh-and-blood detail, and peppered with explosive fragments that chronicle war’s carnage. And in writing his verse, he allowed us to acknowledge that patriotism can recognise the horror of trench and gas warfare, as well as pay tribute to the glory of battle. That to concede that war is hell does not diminish our servicemen’s courage on the battlefield. Kipling’s poem A Soldier Of The Queen captures graphically the terrible realities faced by those on the plains of Afghanistan 170 years ago. ‘When you’re wounded and left on Afghanistan’s plains, And the women come out to cut up what remains, Just roll to your rifle and blow out your brains, An’ go to your Gawd like a soldier.’ But while we willingly laud our fallen and rightly recoil at the carnage they endured, we all too often shy away from the fate of the wounded. The legacy of war, of the pain and injury we inflict upon each other, is not solely represented by those Union Flag-draped coffins solemnly shouldered from the bowels of the military aircraft; it is  epitomised even more graphically by those who survived, albeit with terrible injuries. While we mourn the dead, we do not have to witness the wounds inflicted upon them or their broken bodies. Instead, we are left with their medals, the insignia of heroism and glory. Experience: Siegfried Sassoon eloquently described the First World War, in which he served . In contrast, the scars the wounded bear in our name are paraded before us daily. For many, it is a far too uncomfortable reminder of the true nature of war. Tomorrow, to coincide with Remembrance Day, my book, Wounded: The Legacy Of War, will be published. It is a compilation of stories that celebrate injured British veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Their stories, in their own words, were recorded by my co-author, ITN journalist Caroline Froggatt, while I photographed them. For the majority, this was the first time they had revealed their amputations, their scars and their disabilities to anyone other than their immediate family and friends. Some were willing to reveal their wounds in full; others, understandably, were more hesitant. To witness how they and their families have coped was humbling. Their accounts are searingly honest and at times unsettling. They are raw and visceral. And, at times, what is left unsaid speaks volumes. They recount feats of astonishing valour and determination on the battlefield in a matter-of-fact manner. But what are perhaps most poignant are their descriptions of how they have deployed that same tenacity and courage in coming to terms with learning new tasks. Insight: The poetry of Wilfred Owen, pictured, depicted vividly the horrors of war . These are tasks that most of us take for granted, such as making a cup of tea, getting out of bed, opening a bottle of milk or playing with our children. While their testimonies are both uplifting and thought-provoking, I believe photographs convey what words alone cannot. That was why I was so determined to display in this book the scorching human side of recent wars; to remind us that we must not forget what has happened to these men and women. For if we do, we learn nothing. And while we have the luxury of studying the photographs, wondering how on earth they have endured, for many they will be deeply disturbing. For these soldiers’ families, the pictures are a reminder of their darkest days - a reminder too of how their lives have been altered by their loved ones’ injuries. These proud portraits are proof of how profoundly changed their lives are, and how they have discovered an inner mettle that perhaps they did not realise they possessed. While photographing these wounded men and women I came across a huge variety of injuries. Some victims couldn’t speak properly; many had limbs blown off; others were badly burned or blinded and disfigured. Family history: Although rock legend Bryan Adams, seen right in concert, is Canadian, both his father and grandfather were in the British Army . Each story was different. But what all these soldiers share is the spirit of camaraderie, and an unflinching faith that no matter how horrifically wounded they were, no matter how hazardous their situation, they would not be left behind on the battlefield. That camaraderie is a quite remarkable bond. Some of it is borne of the discipline instilled during their training. Some, perhaps, the result of their shared experiences and stoicism. Much of it, however, is testimony to their dedication. Time and time again they talk of ‘not wanting to let my mates down’; of how they worried for the safety of their comrades, even as they themselves lay wounded. This is the stuff of selfless courage. Yet how do we revere these wounded warriors? Some of us support charities such as Help For Heroes and Walking With The Wounded, which have done incredible things to help. But it is also vital to continue to raise awareness because, while these wars are waged on foreign battlefields, the injured veterans are all someone’s brother, father, sister, mother. They live among us in our communities. Wear it with pride: Adams encourages us to revere the fallen, but also to revere those who have survived . I’ve chosen to support five smaller charities with my book: BLESMA supports Servicemen and women who have lost limbs or their eyesight during combat; Blind Veterans UK provides training and rehabilitation for the visually impaired; Combat Stress counsels psychologically wounded soldiers; SSAFA offers  accommodation and advice in times of need and upheaval; and War Child is a small international charity that protects children from the brutal effects of war and its consequences. So, today, wear your poppy with pride. Embrace and honour The Fallen who died so bravely, and those unsung heroes who soldiered quietly and professionally, but whose deeds have gone unheralded. But revere, too, the injured who survived - those seeming ‘lucky ones’ whose anguished minds and mutilated bodies mean they can never forget either the horrors of battle or the struggle beyond to adapt and overcome. Once the dust settles on the plains of Afghanistan and in the deserts of Iraq, and the spin and propaganda of governments and politicians have become a distant echo, all that is left are the wounded. They are, truly, our legacy of war.","Remembrance Day resonates with the performer because his father and grandfather were both members of the British Army .

"A gay couple are to become parents to three children by three women they met via surrogacy websites. For the past 15 years, Daryl Lee, 41, and Luke Harris, 50, had longed to have children and joined a number of online  forums in an attempt to find a suitable surrogate. They made contact with one of the women, Becky Harris, 27, and through her met Bex Harris, 32, and Viktoria Ellis, 32. Scroll down for video . Fatherhood: Daryl Lee, 41, (left) and Luke Harris, 50, (right) from Surrey, are to become parents to three children by three women they met via surrogacy websites . The couple had always dreamed of having a large family, but were shocked to find that this would happen sooner then they expected when all three women, who live in Suffolk, became pregnant. Mr Lee, 41, is the biological father of two of the children, while Mr Harris, 50, gave his sperm for the third. All three babies will be born within seven months of each other, between January and July next year. 'We love each other very much, but despite that it has felt like something was missing from our lives - our home felt empty without children,' Mr Harris told The Sun's Sarah Arnold. 'We never imagined in our wildest dreams we would have three all at once.' Mr Lee and Mr Harris, who live in Surrey, had met online in 1999, and entered into a civil partnership in 2012. Surrogates: Becky Harris (right), Bex Harris (centre) and Viktoria Ellis (top left) with their neighbour Jemma King (top right) and Bex's mother Karen (left) appeared on ITV's This Morning in July to talk about surrogacy. When they appeared on the show, Bex was already carrying Mr Harris and Mr Lee's baby, Viktoria was preparing to, and Becky was days away from giving birth to another couple's child . Helping others: Becky, who appeared in the show before giving birth to her third surrogate child, told the programme that she 'loves being pregnant' They had considered adopting a child, but decided to try surrogacy after learning that singer Elton John and his partner David Furnish had a child, Zachary, by a surrogate mother in December 2010. Their second son, Elijah, was born via the same woman in January 2013. Gay couples using a surrogate to have a child have only been able to apply for a parental order, giving them the legal rights over the child and relinquishing those of the surrogate since April 2010. Mr Harris and Mr Lee met Becky Harris, but she was already helping another couple and was pregnant with her third surrogate child, so put them in touch with her former sister-in-law, Bex. She in turn introduced them to her friend Miss Ellis, and both became pregnant, before Becky, having given birth to the other couple's baby, decided she would help them too. Mothers: The couple met Becky Harris (left) online, and because she was already helping another couple have a child, she put them in touch with her former sister-in-law Bex Harris (right) Mr Lee said: 'While it is unorthodox to have three surrogates at the same time, we couldn’t turn down what could be our only chance to have the big family we’d always dreamed of.' The couple say their families are happy for them, and are extending their three-bedroom home to add extra bedrooms and bathrooms to fit their brood, who they have dubbed the 'twiplets'. Both Mr Harris and Mr Lee plan to work part time, with one parent at home to care for the children, and Mr Lee's parents will also move in to help them. The mothers say they had all wanted to help Mr Harris and Mr Lee become parents. 'None of us can think of two people more deserving of the joy of fatherhood,' said Becky. The women appeared on ITV's This Morning in June to speak about surrogacy, along with their neighbour Jemma King, and Bex's mother Karen, who has the nickname 'Mother Stork' and takes care of the women. At the time of the programme, Bex, who with her mother introduced Becky to surrogacy, was already pregnant after using Mr Lee's sperm, while Becky was pregnant with the other couple's child, and just one week away from giving birth. Miss Ellis was waiting to try to become pregnant. Friend: Bex introduced the couple to Viktoria Ellis, 32 . 'I absolutely love being pregnant,' Becky said. 'And that inspiration from Bex, wanting to help somebody - it's so strong.' Speaking about how her body reacted when having to hand the child over to its intended parents, she added: 'Your body does wake up thinking it's used to being pregnant and so it thinks there is a baby coming soon so your body does tell you to get up in the night.' Bex said it was seeing the joy on the faces of the intended parents when she hands over the babies that makes her want to be a surrogate, and that the feeling was addictive. She had wanted to become a surrogate since she was just 11 years old, after a friend of the family struggled to conceive. She said: 'It was just always there [the need to help], growing up seeing that it was really hard to watch even as a kid. You just really wanted to help in some way.' She added: Your body recovers a bit quicker because your not getting up in the night or to feed, you can recover a lot quicker so within a week I didn't look like I'd had a child.' Surrogacy UK, a not for profit organisation which introduces surrogate mothers with intended parents said it was highly unusual for a couple to use more than one surrogate. Trustee Sarah Jones told MailOnline:'I think this is a really extreme case and it's not something that would normally happen.' Ms Jones said intended parents would be recommended to use just one surrogate by Surrogacy UK, because of the trust needed between all parties, and the shortage of surrogates within the UK caused by the fact it is illegal to pay women to carry a child. 'There is a waiting list for couples who are waiting for them,' she said. 'The surrogate chooses the couple, not the other way around. They go on our waiting list and they wait to be chosen. 'They come off the waiting list while they are waiting to become pregnant, they get to know the surrogate in depth. 'If someone wanted to work with more than one surrogate they would have to do that independently.' Ms Jones said the number of gay couples turning to surrogacy had increased since 2010. 'The laws changed so gay couple could apply for parental orders,' she said. 'Because of that law change we have seen an increase in gay couples coming to us.' There are two types of surrogacy, 'straight' surrogacy, in which the surrogate uses her own egg and is also the biological mother, and 'host' surrogacy, where the egg comes from another woman. Under UK law, it is illegal to pay a surrogate mother to carry a child, other than reasonable expenses such as travel costs, maternity clothing, care for her other children or counselling. Agencies recommend these expenses amount to no more than £15,000. The woman who gives birth to the child is always treated as the legal mother, and has the right to keep the child - even if she is not genetically related to the baby. If she has one, the mother's husband or boyfriend is regarded as the legal father, but if she is unmarried the name of the genetic father can be put on the birth certificate. The legal rights over the child are given to another intended parent through a parental order or adoption. In the UK a parental order is only open to couples in a long-term relationship and following the grant of the order the child will be issued with a new birth certificate. Gay couples using a surrogate to have a child have only been able to apply for a parental order since April 2010. Surrogacy contracts are not enforced by UK law, even if a contract has been signed with the intended parents and they have paid for any expenses. The birth mother is entitled to maternity leave, but the parents who she is carrying for do not currently have the same rights regarding maternity or paternity leave as those who have their children naturally or adopt. Employers may offer paid leave, but this is at their discretion. However, this is set to change in April next year. In the UK, just 83 surrogate births were registered in 2010, but with surrogacy becoming more popular, this figure is expected to rise to 200 for this year. The shortage of surrogates in the UK means some intended parents find surrogate mothers abroad. It is estimated that thousands of parents take this option, although there are no official figures.","Daryl Lee, 41, and Luke Harris, 50, have always wanted to have children .

"As property prices in London continue to skyrocket, with an average home in the centre of the city now costing £641,000, it will come as little surprise to learn that you can save money by moving out of the capital and commuting back in. What is surprising is that, by moving outside of the capital, you could save up to half a million on the cost of a house, with an average saving of £380,000 if you move to 21 towns that are between 45 and 70 minutes away from central. In fact, property within London travel zones one and two is now so expensive that by moving just ten minutes away, buyers save an average of £276,000. Clever commuter: Those living outside London but travelling an hour into work each morning could save £380,000 on the average home. Moving to Wellingborough will mean you pocket £490,600 which would take 75 years to wipe out in transport costs. Graphic credit: The Guardian . According to data from Lloyds Banking Group, moving to Wellingborough, which is just 53 minutes on a train from London, could save you £490,600 on the cost of an average home. With an average season ticket costing £6,548 it would take nearly 75 years before the saving was wiped out. Other prime commuter towns include Kettering, where average prices are £477,200 less than in central London, and Peterborough, where the cost of an average house is just £171, 600, with average season tickets costing £7,200 for both.

"Three babies have been declared HIV-free after being treated with a revolutionary new drug only hours after they were born. The fourth child only has 'a very low level' of the virus after receiving the same treatment. The findings, to be announced at the AIDS 2014 conference in Melbourne from July 20, are a major breakthrough in the fight against AIDS with scientists hoping it could lead to a cure if treatment his received early enough. Four Canadian babies have been cleared of having HIV after being born to HIV-positive mothers, due to being given a high dose of three different antiretroviral drugs . It's not yet known how old the babies are now but more is expected to be released when 14,000 delegates from nearly 200 countries descend on Melbourne to share their research and the latest scientific advances in the field. AIDS 2014 co-chairman, Professor Sharon Lewin, told the Daily Mail Australia that despite some people labelling the results as a 'cure', it can not yet be officially classed as one. 'At the moment, the doctors do not know whether they are in fact cured. The only way they can tell is if they stop the anti-HIV drugs and see if it comes back,' Professor Lewin said. 'We are excited about this though because all four received very early treatment after delivery, and when doctors tried to locate the virus they could find virtually no viruses in their systems. 'These baby cases, and more cases amongst adults, tell us that if we treat HIV very early in some people were able to stop it. News of the four babies and their success stories comes only a year after the very first child to ever be 'cured' of HIV was officially announced. 'And in some people, maybe only 10 per cent or so who start treatment very early, it might even be safe for them to stop taking their drugs and their virus stays under control. However this is still a research question that needs to be addressed.' 'However you must keep in mind that the best way to stop babies getting HIV is to treat the mother during pregnancy,' she added. After contracting the virus from their mothers, the four Canadian-born children were given a high dose of three different antiretroviral drugs. News of the four babies and their success stories comes only a year after the very first child to ever be 'cured' of HIV was officially announced. The baby, born in Mississippi in 2010, and was cleared of any infection in 2013. The mother of the child only found out that she was infected with HIV during her labor and thus was not able to take precautionary action which could help her unborn child avoid infection. The major breakthrough will be discussed amongst a whole range of other new research at the AIDS conference in Melbourne from July 20-25 . According to the University of Mississippi, Dr. Hannah Gay associate professor of pediatrics and a HIV specialist, gave the baby a three-drug antiretroviral therapeutic prescription, beginning the  treatment when she was only 30-hours-old - despite not having confirmation that the baby was infected at the time. Only 29 days later, the virus could not be found in the infant's system and did not return after the child stopped taking her prescription. However the four Canadian children are yet to stop taking their treatment and doctors are unable to determine if the virus is likely to return if they do. In 2009, an American man called Timothy Ray Brown received bone marrow from a donor who was resistant to HIV and was later given the all-clear by a Berlin hospital.","Three Canadian born babies have been declared HIV-free after receiving treatment straight after their births .

"GPs who repeatedly fail to spot crucial signs of cancer are to be named and shamed under radical new plans being drawn up by Ministers. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has vowed to root out doctors who cost patients’ lives by failing to send them for vital hospital tests soon enough. Family doctors found to be dismissing cancer symptoms as something less serious will be identified with a ‘red flag’ on an NHS website. Health secretary Jeremy Hunt, who has vowed to root out doctors who cost lives by failing to send patients for vital hospital tests soon enough . Figures show that one in ten cancer sufferers have had to see their GP at least five times before being referred to hospital to be diagnosed. Last night Mr Hunt told The Mail on Sunday: ‘We need to do much better. Cancer diagnosis levels around the country vary significantly and we must do much more to improve both the level of diagnosis and to bring those GP practices with  poor referral rates up to the standards of the best.’ Every year 80,000 people – a quarter of all new cancer cases – are only diagnosed at A&E, in part because GPs miss so many. Luke O'Reilly, pictured with his mother Diane Howell, left, and his girlfriend Lucy Toule, right. Ms Howell visited her GP 15 times before being referred to hospital for tests . Last night families who had lost loved ones because GPs had failed to spot cancer welcomed the move. Luke O’Reilly, whose mother Diane Howell had to see a GP 15 times before being referred for tests, said: ‘Rating family doctors on cancer is essential. My mum was made to feel she was wasting the doctors’ time when she was actually very ill.’ Under the Government’s planned reforms, surgeries will be ranked as ‘green’ for cancer on the NHS Choices website if they quickly refer patients to hospital when they are showing possible signs of cancer. But if they miss too many cancer cases – or if patients have to return numerous times before being sent for tests – they will be classed as ‘red’. Where there is insufficient data to reach a firm conclusion, patients will be told just that. Meanwhile, Tory insiders have revealed they are looking at a range of other NHS initiatives which include: . Experts have found Britain lags behind other European countries when it comes to cancer survival rates, and that the main reason is late diagnosis. If Britain’s cancer survival record matched the European average, at least 5,000 fewer people would die of the disease in the UK each year. Mr Hunt said: ‘I want Britain to be among the best in Europe for cancer survival and early diagnosis plays a crucial role in achieving that.’ But the Royal College of GPs has criticised the proposed rating system as ‘crude’ and said the Government should be ‘supporting GPs, not criticising them’. There are also fears the plan could prompt GPs to send in patients indiscriminately for cancer tests - flooding hospital specialists with overwhelmingly healthy patients. However, mechanical engineer Mr O’Reilly, 29, said the rating system was ‘really needed’ to stop tragedies such as the death of his mother. She died of cancer last November, just three months after being diagnosed – but wasted eight months going back and forth to her GP surgery in Newark, Nottinghamshire, complaining of severe but unexplained back pain. More than once she was sent to a physiotherapist, who kept returning her to the GP knowing the pain was ‘not muscular’. The delay meant her cancer spread beyond her pancreas into her liver, lungs and spleen, and by the time it was diagnosed last August it was inoperable. Rachel Bown, who had several visits to her GP before she was eventually diagnosed with bowel cancer . Mr O’Reilly said: ‘We put our trust in doctors and when you are told there’s nothing wrong, you go away believing it. If there’s a system that shows your local doctor is not good at spotting cancer, then you might go elsewhere.’ Doctors believed mother-of-two Rachel Bown was too young for bowel cancer, even though she told them her aunt had died of it at 50. When the marketing executive first visited her GP in High Wycombe, Bucks, and raised the possibility she was told it was ‘most unlikely’ her constant stomach pains and other symptoms were caused by cancer. At the time she was 45. She recalled: ‘When she said it was probably irritable bowel syndrome I was hugely relieved – it was exactly what I wanted to hear. The second time they told me I could be going through the menopause.’ Twice put off, she delayed going again until she was ‘doubled-up in pain’ – when a locum GP went through a tick-box form and referred her for a colonoscopy which identified cancer. But during the year-long delay the tumour had spread. Ms Bown, now 48 and in remission, said: ‘Doctors need to stop being complacent about cancer. Rating GPs is a massively good idea because so many cancer cases are curable if caught early. These are not statistics: they are people’s lives. An early diagnosis can be the difference between life and death. The number of times I’ve heard stories of misdiagnosis is frightening.’ She thinks rating GPs would force them to be more methodical and make them ‘open up the discussion on cancer, rather than expecting the patient to raise the possibility’. Nick Bason, head of policy at the charity Bowel Cancer UK, said: ‘Anything that encourages GPs to rule out cancer first, rather than last, is a good thing.’ Ali Stunt, founder of Pancreatic Cancer Action, thought ‘naming and shaming’ GPs would ‘pull up’ poor performers.  She said: ‘We know that 40 per cent of patients with pancreatic cancer have to visit their GP four times or more before being referred. A tenth have to see them ten times or more.’ Dr Richard Roope, who speaks on cancer issues for the Royal College of GPs, feared doctors might be wrongly labelled as failing on cancer if the rating system was implemented. He said: ‘We know that we can always improve, but using crude ranking systems to measure our performance and ability to care for our patients, may not tell the whole story. The data would be complex and should be approached with caution.’ He added: ‘GPs across the UK are doing an excellent job of appropriately referring our patients that we suspect of having cancer; 75 per cent of patients found to have cancer are referred after only one or two GP consultations. ‘Family doctors are working harder than ever to try and provide the best care possible when funding for general practice is at an all-time low and we have a chronic shortage of doctors. We should be supporting GPs, not criticising them.’","Jeremy Hunt vows to root out doctors who fail to send patients for tests .

"While LG and Samsung promote their curved handsets with bendable displays, rival Nokia appears to have been silently working on the next stage in flexible technology. A patent, originally filed in March, has come to light this week suggesting the Finnish firm is working on foldable batteries. It describes a battery pack made up of ‘foldable cells’ that can curve and bend with the shape of a phone, as well as being capable of folding in on itself. Nokia's patent describes a battery pack made up of 'foldable cells', pictured, that can curve and bend with the shape of a phone. The technology could also be capable of folding in on itself, meaning it fits into smaller, tighter spaces and is more suited to wearable technology, designed to move with a person's body . Aside from being bendy, the technology also has the benefit of being able to be made smaller. This means it could fit into places within a phone’s circuit that other solid, and even bendable, batteries can’t. This could lead to super-thin devices, or advancements in batteries used in wearable technology designed to curve and move with a person’s body. According to Nokia’s patent: ‘Portable electronic devices are made with consistently smaller form factors. ‘Even though the internal components are becoming smaller and smaller, batteries generally lag behind other technological advancements, consistently consuming a large portion of the portable electronic device. Nokia recently unveiled its Lumia 1520 phone, pictured left, and the Lumia 2520 tablet, pictured right. Based on the details filed in the patent, future Nokia devices could be curved, similar to LG's G Flex phone, be super-thin, or could fold in themselves . It continues that batteries tend to take on ‘rectangular box-type’ forms and this means phones have to be equally rectangular in shape to maximise the use of space. ‘In current portable electronic devices, to have a curved and aesthetically pleasing form factor, space is generally wasted between the battery and a case making the portable electronic device seem larger and a result may be less appealing,’ added Nokia. ‘Additionally, there may also be wasted space between the internal components and the case and/or between certain internal components.’ The technology behind the plans, . including what the cells would be made of and how exactly they would fit . together, was not fully explained in the patent. LG's G Flex phone, pictured, was launched in October with a self-healing case. Japanese firm Natoco also makes a similar technology called Self Healing Cure. Natoco's coating is made from polymer-alloy . It is not the first battery capable of changing its shape, however.  LG Chem, the research arm of the Korean phone maker LG, unveiled its curved battery design earlier this year. LG Chem used thin strands of . copper wire, coated with nickel-tin, which are then spun into a 'metal . yarn' and wrapped around a rod. The rod is then removed, leaving a strong spring which can be tucked into tight and small spaces. The team said: 'In our experiments we found that our . prototype was exceptionally ﬂexible and could suffer large strain . without malfunction.' They agreed with Nokia and said that when designing new devices, 'the limiting factor is often the . shape of the battery' and that their battery could be 'a disruptive . technology that could open up a path for design innovation.'","Nokia’s patent application, filed originally in March, is called ‘Battery Pack’

"Growing up can be hard. From the braces and awkward growth spurts to fashion mishaps and the pressure of trying to keep up with your peers. However, Utah graphic designer and photographer Merilee Allred is reclaiming those goofy years with a photo project to show that despite the embarrassing school photos, those awkward years can inspire people on to bigger and better things. Her Awkward Years Project features adults who were bullied at school, but have gone on to amazing careers, traveled the world and, most importantly, learned to love themselves. 'Queen of the nerds': Merilee Allred started the Awkward Years Project to help get over her memories of being bullied . Strength: Autumn, who was bullied by her classmates and her teacher, says the picture reminds her to feel proud of what she has come through . From charity worker and celebrity reporter Autumn, who was even ridiculed by her teacher over the leg braces she had to wear in school, to Martie, who used to be teased over her looks but found through true friends that she could enjoy life and be herself, the project chronicles how the path to a happy life does not come with designer clothes or fancy hairstyles. Merilee's inspiration came from her own experiences, after a friend refused to believe she had ever suffered an awkward phase and asked for photographic proof. The self-described Queen of the Nerds said even though she had put the years of bullying behind her, she was reluctant to share her old school photo. 'You know that mentality of overweight . people who have lost so much weight but they still see themselves as . fat? That’s how I feel. I may look normal now, but I still see myself as . an awkward nerd,' she said. 'I wanted to take a picture of myself then and now, . as if I had to hold my 5th grade self’s hand before giving it to my . friend.' Difficult phase: Laura poses with a school picture showing off her big hair and braces . Growing pains: Chef Mark admits his awkward phase came after leaving high school . Embracing the past: Daisy has come to love the characteristics that marked her out as 'different' at school . Her experiences made Merilee decide to start her Awkward Years Project, which currently features eight men and women who came through bullying. Some were able to laugh off their experiences, such as Gina who posed with a contact sheet of three school photos, and claimed that no one had wanted to cut one out and frame it. Others, such as Merliee's sister Martie, who was teased for her looks, not only grew out of her awkward years, but went on to become a model who travels the world doing photo shoots. Chef and photographer Mark, who posed in a denim shirt, cap and suspenders was also ready to admit that his awkward years came after he had finished high school. Many in the project, such as roller derby skater and journalist Daisy, described how they have come to embrace the very characteristics they had been teased about. Daisy, who grew up in a farmhouse in the British countryside, said she was teased for being different when she went to school but added: 'As I got older I started to reclaim those ""different"" things as a source of great pride.' On to better things: Stacey left behind her school years to travel to China, where she taught English . Accepting: Gina was able to joke about her awkward photos, claiming no one wanted to put them in a frame . Be yourself: Martie says her years of being teased taught her to value her real friends . For Autumn, the project was a cathartic experience. She suffered years of bullying - from fellow pupils and even her teacher - because of her health problems. In her section on the online project she said: 'Looking at this picture brings up many emotions. A lot of sadness over the way I was treated and what I went through. But also pride, because I bore it all and the outcome isn’t so bad.' Her experience is at the core of what Merilee wanted to achieve. In her own profile on the project, which can be seen on the designer's website, she said: 'If I can share that part of my past next to the person that I turned out to be, I can embrace my little nerdy self and be OK with it.'","Utah photographer's project shows despite the bullies, life does get better .

"Having a catflap-sized hole and being far away from foxes is a decent outdoor home for any moggy. But you wouldn't have expected this black and white cat to move into an owl box 20ft up an old oak tree - clambering up and giving birth to four cute kittens there. The box, which was put up on private woodland near Rugby, Warwickshire, around four years ago to attract more wildlife to the area, had previously been home to a family of Little Owls. New home: This black and white cat has set up home in an owl box up an old oak tree - clambering up there and giving birth to four cute kittens . Peek-a-boo: The newborn cats are honing their hunting skills and leaping between branches on the tree . Spotted: Photographer Paul Bunyard, 41, saw the cats relaxing in the sun in Rugby, Warwickshire . But the newborn cats are now honing their hunting skills and leaping between branches on the tree. Photographer Paul Bunyard saw them relaxing in the sun and poking their heads through the box’s catflap sized hole. The 41-year-old said: ‘The estate management put four barn owl boxes up about four years ago in a bid to attract more wildlife to the area. We have had mixed success with this particular box. ‘Nothing nested in the first year, we had a family of Little Owls in the second, nothing in the third, and now these cats in the fourth. ‘One of the estate workers was shocked to see the mother cat and her kittens poking their head out of the box. It was a real “wow” moment.

The wild cats have previously nested in a nearby barn, where workers store chopped wood. But Mr Bunyard added: ‘This box is much safer for them because they are off the ground away from foxes. It is also warmer. ‘Now these cats are living the high life I wouldn’t be surprised if they returned next year too. ‘We don’t mind having them around but would rather they returned the box to the owls - who are the rightful homeowners.’","Box put up on private woodland near Rugby, Warwickshire, four years ago .

"Britons are getting more sophisticated when it comes to their pies, with more diners choosing upmarket gourmet pastries for their traditional meat treat at mealtimes. Sales of posh pies are going up as premium pies produced by celebrity chefs such as Heston Blumenthal are boosting demand in the market, a study showed. Shoppers choosing to treat themselves at home instead of heading to the pub for a plate of the meat and mash combo have also pushed sales of posh pastries and pies. Pie makers with their creative combinations and ingenious ingredients have reversed the dip in pie demand . Although volume sales of chilled pies were down 1.5 per cent, pioneering pie makers with their creative combinations and ingenious ingredients, have succeeded in bucking the trend, trade magazine The Grocer reported. Their research showed brands that moved upmarket succeeded in reversing the overall downward dip in demand. The upturn in sales was not just applicable to pie players such as Higgidy and Pieminister as supermarket own-label products were wooing the premium pie fanbase as well. 'For proof, just look at such offerings as Heston from Waitrose Pork & Piccalilli Pie with pepper, ginger and mace; Tesco Finest Slow Cooked Scotch Steak Pie; Asda Bistro Ultimate Steak & Ale Pie or the Chicken, Bacon & Mushroom pie in the new top-tier M&S frozen foods range,' The Grocer said. Brands like Higgidy are taking the credit for the humble pie's push to the posher end of the spectrum . Charles Coleman, co-founder of branded and own-label supplier Deli Sante says that such products can hold their own against brands and even pub grub. He told the magazine: 'As the economy improves, people invest a bit more when they shop. Our products are similar to the fare you would find in a good pub.' But brands take the credit for beginning the humble pie's push to the posher end of the spectrum. Mark Campbell, managing director of Higgidy said: 'For many years the pie category had been ""value engineered"", quality and innovation had dropped, and the category haemorrhaged consumers. 'However, activity at the premium end has reinvigorated the category and started to bring consumers back.' Posh pies have also benefited from the recession as people have changed their eating habits, according to Ginster sales and marketing director Linda Evans. She told The Grocer: 'There is evidence that consumers, while cutting back on dining out, have been prepared to spend more money on treating themselves with meal solutions in the home.'","Recipes by celebrity chefs like Heston Blumenthal have boosted sales .

"A humble tea taster is now part of a select group of talented A-listers. Joining the upper echelons of those whose assets are insured - among them Madonna's breasts, Heidi Klum's legs, Keith Richard's hands and Julia Roberts' smile – is Sebastian Michaelis. The 32-year-old  is to have his tastebuds insured for by British tea brand Tetley for £1million. Sebastian Michaelis is 'flattered' that he's now in the same league as Hollywood A-listers Madonna, Heidi Klum and Julia Roberts. Tetley has insured the tea blender's tongue for £1m . 'It's very flattering of course', Mr Michaelis said to MailOnline Food of his new status. 'Although my tongue is a little less glamorous than Heidi's legs or Julia's smile. 'I usually drink my tea piping hot, so may have to be extra careful now and leave it to cool a while.' There are 1,500 different varieties of tea in the world and the palate of Mr Michaelis is so refined, he can taste and grade any single one in just 15 seconds. His taste buds have distinguished more than 250,000 blends of tea during his nine-year career at Tetley. Years spent touring tea gardens from Africa to India has seen the master tea blender develop, hone and refine his sense of taste. It takes five or more years of tasting hundreds of teas a week to build a good vocabulary of the countless different flavours,' Mr Michaelis explained. Expensive assets: Heidi Klum's legs are covered for £1.2m . 'Some teas have very unlikely tastes. A well-made Assam tea will often have a raspberry jam flavor and you even get a strong taste Calpol on some Sri Lankan teas. 'Blending tea, like blending whisky or champagne, is a fine art. First I examine and grade the colour, size and density of the leaf. 'Then I assess the brew's purity of colour (its sparkle), the weight of the tea in the mouth (its body) and the overall liveliness of the tea on the palate (its zing).' As it's his job to drink tea, does he hate the taste by the time he's finished? Or does he still like drinking tea? 'I still drink loads of tea even at the end of a long day,' he continued. 'Tasting tea is different from drinking it, as I have to slurp it off a soup spoon and then spit it out. 1) The tea should be made with boiling water ­and only once-boiled water with a low mineral content if possible. This is because reboiling reduces oxygen levels and affects the taste, whilst water with a low mineral content allows the tea notes to come through better. 2) If you're making black tea, stand by the kettle to ensure you pour as soon as it's boiled. Black tea tastes best when brewed in water as close to boiling point as possible. That's why your cuppa may taste different on a plane. In the reduced pressure environment, the boiling point is lowered to 90°. 3) But if you're making green tea, allow the kettle to cool for up to two minutes. This will make sure that your tea doesn't over-infuse and develop a bitter taste. Green teas are more delicate after all. 4) When using a tea bag in a cup, always add your milk after the water, otherwise the milk will cool the water down and hinder the all important infusion process. If using a teapot, try adding the milk to the cup first. This traditional technique stopped the delicate porcelain cups from cracking. 5) Leave the bag in for at least two minutes to provide sufficient time to let the flavour of the tea to infuse. This is more of a guideline though; the perfect brew is down to personal preference. But do not poke or prod the bag while it is infusing ­ be patient and let the process happen naturally! 6) After removing the bag, leave the brew to cool down for around two-three minutes. As the temperature reduces, the flavours will develop for a better quality taste . Mr Michaelis has distinguished more than 250,000 blends of tea during his nine-year career at Tetley . Madonna's breasts are covered for £1.2m and Julia Roberts' killer smile is worth £18.6m . 165,000,000 cups of tea is drunk in the UK every day. 40% of our daily fluid intake comes from tea.

"Tragic: Amanda Todd, 15, was found dead on October 10 after killing herself to escape cyber bullies . Anonymous has named a man it claims posted topless pictures of a 15-year-old girl online and harassed her so relentlessly that she killed herself. Amanda Todd, from Vancouver, Canada, was found hanged in her home on October 10, just weeks after she uploaded a video to YouTube detailing her horrific treatment at the hands of cyber bullies. When she was just 12, a man in an internet chat room convinced her to flash her breasts, and a year later, he plastered a picture of the incident across Facebook. Now in a vigilante move, Anonymous, the world's largest hacking group, has named the man allegedly responsible for the picture. The group claims that he is a 32-year-old from British Columbia, but MailOnline has chosen not to identify him for legal reasons. As Todd's supporters set up Facebook pages warning the man to 'sleep with one eye open', the move by Anonymous sparks concerns over its abilities to create a 'trial by internet' - bypassing the justice system and casting guilt. In a video posted to YouTube by Anonymous, a figure claims the group lists his personal information, including his date of birth and address. It explains that his username appears on websites where he 'blackmailed' and gave advice to young girls. The same username is also tied to a website with a 'jailbait' photo gallery. Scroll down for videos . Revealed: In a YouTube video, Anonymous claimed that the man behind the bullying was a 32-year-old from British Columbia . '[He] is an abomination to our society, and will be punished,' the Anonymous figure says. Referring to the possibility they . might have the wrong man, they add: 'At the most this is the person who . did this to Amanda Todd, and at the least it's another pedophile that . enjoys taking advantage of children.' Following . Anonymous' announcement, the web moved swiftly, with groups calling for . his death and warning him to 'sleep with one eye open' cropping up on Facebook. CKNW reporters . have unsuccessfully tried to speak with the man, and neighbours have . described his home as 'a known party house on the weekend with lots of . young women coming and going'. But police attended the home on Monday . after a neighbour, Chyne Simpson, said Anonymous named the wrong . address. He said he felt threatened by internet users and asked them to . stay away. Haunting: Amanda posted a nine-minute video explaining her longstanding bullying on a series of notecards . Depressing: The story reveals that she previously tried to kill herself twice and is receiving help . The Royal Canadian Mounted Police . refused to confirm Anonymous have the right man but a spokesperson said they were . aware that someone had been named. 'We are aware of what’s being posted . online and certainly following up what we feel is important to follow . up,' Sergeant Peter Thiessen told The Globe and Mail, adding: '[Vigilantes] run the risk of . committing a criminal offence.' Todd's family members also said they . are not sure the Anonymous report is accurate and said police . have tracked down a person living in the U.S. whom they . believed was involved. The claims come weeks after Amanda posted a nearly nine-minute YouTube video detailing her . treatment on a stack of notecards held up to the camera, . Todd says that a . year after she flashed her breasts, the man tracked her down and demanded he put on a show for . him or he would expose her. Final message: The video was posted just over a month before she was found dead on Wednesday . When she refused, he created a Facebook . page with a list of her friends and used her naked chest as the profile . photo. The picture quickly spread across the internet and among her . classmates. It led to . relentless bullying online, she said, and she was diagnosed with . depression and started drinking. In the video, posted September 7, she admitted that she had previously tried to kill herself twice and has been hospitalised. After . moving to a different city and school, another instance of bullying . occurred after she started a romantic relationship with an older man who . had a girlfriend. Once that relationship soured, she was confronted and beaten up by the man's girlfriend. She was hit in front of a crowd of screaming people who encouraged her to be left in a ditch. Suicide: Todd was found hanged in her home on October 10 - just one month before her 16th birthday . Trouble: It came after she flashed on a webcam and the image of her topless was posted to Facebook . Amanda . does not speak in the video, and her face is not fully shown, but she . confirmed her identity with the last notecard which says her name. One of the final images is a jarring picture of her arm which had been cut repeatedly. Just under six weeks after posting the video, Todd could take the . bullying no longer, and took her own life. During a memorial for Todd on Monday, her friends said they have been aware of a man in his 30s 'stalking' their friend for years. 'There were multiple accounts with random names,' one friend told QMI Agency. 'There were Twitter accounts also used.' The Vancouver Sun reported that Amanda was a student in Grade 10 at the Coquitlam Basic Alternative Education school. Shock: Friends gather at a memorial honoring Todd in Maple Ridge, British Columbia earlier this week . Loss: Flowers and candles are left at the memorial, five days after Todd killed herself to escape the bullies . The principal of the school confirmed . her death and said that she had become connected with many since she . transferred to the school in the middle of last year. 'It is a very sad case,' Paul . McNaughton told the paper. 'I can tell you we feel we tried everything . we could to help her when she came to us.' Her death prompted a local politician to release a video of her own that pleads to put an end to bullying. 'I just heard about Amanda. I want to say to everyone who loved her, to all her family and friends, how sorry I am about her loss,' British Columbia premier Christy Clark said. 'No one deserves to be bullied. No one earns it. No one asks for it. It isn't a rite of passage. Bullying has to stop.' Anonymous is an umbrella term for an internet subculture – a collection of individuals, . or 'hacktivists', who share common ideas of anti-censorship and freedom . of speech on the internet. While Anonymous is focused on freedom of speech, releasing names of internet harassers is new territory for the group, which is best known for hacking government and company websites. They have carried out cyber attacks on Visa, MasterCard, PayPal and Amazon, and have threatened to take down Facebook and Twitter servers. The group has connections with the lesser-known hacking group LulzSec, short for Lulz Security, an elite hacker group that has claimed responsibility for high-profile, debilitating cyber attacks. Their big hits include the compromising of user account data from Sony Pictures and taking the CIA website offline. They also attacked Fox.com, leaking the names of more than 7,000 X Factor contestants, and the PBS Newshour website, where they posted a story claiming that slain killer Tupac was still living and in New Zealand. The group aims to cause mayhem and manipulate flaws in security and passwords systems. It is believed to have caused billions of dollars in damages to corporations, banks and agencies. It hit the headlines in March this year after Hector Xavier Monsegur, one of the group's ringleaders and an influential member of Anonymous, turned fellow hackers over to authorities. After his arrest in New York on hacking charges in June 2011, the 28-year-old reportedly began working with the FBI to bring down the groups' top members, and five were later arrested.

"Threat: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg says he could block any moves to cut the top rate of income tax . Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, today issued a stunning threat to stymie Chancellor George Osborne's plans to abolish the 50p tax rate. He said cutting rates for the wealthy while millions were struggling to make ends meet could 'destroy' public support for the entire tax system. In an interview with The Independent no the eve of today's opening of the Liberal Democrat conference, Mr Clegg also acknowledged that the Government had to do more to boost growth in the economy by adopting what he called a 'Plan A-plus'. His remarks risk a clash with Mr Osborne, the Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer, who has made no secret of his desire to abolish the 50p rate on incomes over £150,000. There is vocal opposition to the top rate of tax, particularly from the financial sector. Earlier this month, 20 leading economists warned that Britain now has one of the highest personal tax regimes in the industrialised world. And on Thursday right-leaning think-tank the Institute of Fiscal studies said that the 50p rate was encouraging the wealthy to dodge taxes and move their money overseas. However Mr Clegg made clear that as far as the Lib Dems were concerned, the priority had to be reducing the burden of taxation on lower and middle income earners. 'We are not there to rush to the aid of the top 1 per cent of very, very rich people who are not in straitened circumstances,' he said. 'If millions of taxpayers feel they are being overlooked, ignored and passed over, as preference is given to people who need the least amount of help at the moment, you destroy the very fabric of consensus without which a sensible tax system cannot survive. 'It would be utterly incomprehensible for millions of people who work hard, do their best for their families, and play by the rules, if suddenly the priority is to give 300,000 people at the very, very top a tax break. 'It is not going to happen - certainly not until there is significant progress on giving tax breaks to those on lower and middle incomes.' Clash: George Osborne, the Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer, has made no secret of his desire to abolish the 50p rate of tax in incomes over £150,000 . While Mr Clegg's show of muscle-flexing on the eve of the party conference season will play well with Lib Dem activists, it will infuriate many Tories who are determined to see an end to the 50p rate. However Mr Clegg made clear the Lib Dems would back abolition in the long run only if it was not raising much revenue and if it was replaced by new taxes on 'unearned income'. These could include a 1 per cent annual 'mansion tax' on homes worth more than £2million, a land tax, and restricting tax relief on pensions to the basic 20p rate. Mr Clegg also risked further antagonising by Mr Osborne - who has always insisted there was no 'Plan B' alternative to his deficit reduction plan - by conceding the Government had adopted a 'Plan A-plus' to ensure growth. 'We need to do more in government. We are doing more,' he said. 'For too long people have assumed that, because we are sticking to the fiscal plan, somehow the Government is impotent. It is complete nonsense.' 'Cuts are criminal': A hoarding outside the Hyatt hotel where Nick Clegg and members of the Liberal Democrats will stay . Three people have been charged with causing a danger to road users after a protest near the venue hosting the Liberal Democrats' autumn conference. The men - a 19-year-old from Leeds, a 21-year-old from Doncaster and a 22-year-old from Fleet in Hampshire - were arrested last night after an incident near Birmingham's International Convention Centre (ICC). A spokeswoman for West Midlands Police said the men had been charged this afternoon after they allegedly scaled a bridge which connects the Hyatt Hotel to the ICC last night to unfurl a banner. The spokeswoman said: 'As a result of these actions debris fell into Broad Street, creating a hazard to pedestrians and motorists. 'West Midlands Police continues to monitor a small peaceful protest near to the ICC. Whilst we recognise and support the democratic right for people to peacefully protest, we continue to balance this with ensuring the safety and security of all those attending these events, as well as the wider Birmingham community.' Those charged will appear at Birmingham Magistrates Court on Monday. As the Lib Dem conference opened today, members were told they face the challenge of breaking down the 'dependency culture' and setting people free. Councillor Paul Tilsley, Birmingham City Council's Lib Dem Group Leader urged activists listening at the ICC to come up with policies which 'strike a chord with the electorate'. Councillor Tilsley, who is also the Council's Deputy Leader said the site was important as it saw the formation of the National Liberal Federation in 1877 and a speech by Gladstone. He said: 'The challenge for us not only as a party, but as part of the Coalition is how we can break down the dependency culture that was created by the last Labour Government. 'We have to set people free, we have to give them the opportunity of getting away from what has become state subsidies.' Cllr Tilsley added: 'So the challenges that we have over the next few days are to come up with policies that strike a chord with the electorate, who will point the country in the right direction and ensure that it all started in Birmingham because of our heritage as far as Liberalism is concerned.' The Lib Dem leadership will attempt to notch up an early success with activists today by opening the conference with a pledge to press ahead with moves to legalise same-sex marriages. Pledge: Lib Dem Equalities Minister Lynne Featherstone will promise a public consultation on gay marriage . Equalities Minister Lynne Featherstone will use her speech to promise a public consultation early next year, ensuring legislation can be in place by the time of the next general election in May 2015. However - in a possible sign of conference season tensions within the coalition - senior Conservatives were making clear the move had been pushed through with the personal backing of David Cameron. The five-day conference event is the first major gathering of Lib Dem activists since nearly 700 of its councillors were ejected in a local election bloodbath in May. That humiliation was swiftly followed by a crushing referendum defeat for its cherished ambition of changing the voting system. In what party president Tim Farron describes in his conference message as a 'particularly distressing' year, the party has also faced student anger and riots over its U-turn on scrapping tuition fees and seen its opinion poll rating remain very low. The election results sparked calls for Mr Clegg to quit as party leader but he instead promised a 'muscular' campaign to exert a stronger Lib Dem influence over Government policy. Apparent successes, notably in securing extensive changes to the Tory-led NHS reforms, appear to have calmed internal dissent though that issue could still prove a flashpoint with staunch critics of even the reformed package seeking a vote on the issue.","Lib Dem leader flexes muscles on eve of conference .

"A woman reported a stalker to the police 125 times before he almost stabbed her to death in a graveyard. Joe Willis, 49, dragged Helen Pearson into a cemetery after she had suffered the ‘hell’ of his stalking for five years. Begging for her life, the 34-year-old was only saved when a female motorist noticed the commotion and confronted Willis. 'Five years of hell': Helen Pearson, 49, (pictured left) reported stalker Joe Willis, 49, (pictured right) to the police 125 times before he attacked her in a cemetery. He was convicted of attempted murder on Tuesday . Campaign of abuse: Willis began stalking Miss Pearson in 2009. Over the course of five years he vandalised her home, car, and even left death threats in graffiti on the street near where she lived (pictured) A court heard she thought she was going to die as her former neighbour pinned her down and stabbed her in the face and back with a pair of foot-long scissors. Willis, of Exeter, Devon, was convicted on Tuesday of attempting to murder his victim, who had already considered suicide because of his sustained abuse. After the hearing Miss Pearson slammed the police for missing repeated opportunities to end her stalking nightmare which began in January 2009. She said the attack in the historic cemetery known as The Catacombs was the culmination of five years of hell. She kept a diary which recorded 125 incidents she reported to Devon and Cornwall police. Her parents - who were also targeted - say they were eventually forced to hire a private detective to hunt down her tormentor. Miss Pearson said the stalking began after Willis asked her to go and watch a pub band with him but she declined. The harassment began with silent . phone calls but moved on to vandalism of her home and car, graffiti in . the street and attacks on her parents’ home. A dead cat was left on her doorstep and she had to install grilles on her windows and change her mobile phone every few months. She . was also sent threatening letters which revealed Willis knew her . movements and included personal items stolen from her rubbish bin. Injuries: Miss Pearson was hit in the face and received six stab wounds to her back when Willis attacked her with a pair of scissors . Damage: Willis repeatedly vandalised Miss Pearson's home - splattering her front door with cream paint and leaving a dead cat on her doorstep . Prosecutor . Richard Crabb said Willis, a former mechanic, lay in wait for Miss . Pearson and intended to murder her but was thwarted by a brave passing . woman driver who stopped and ran into the Exeter graveyard to intervene. Recalling the terrifying attack last October, Miss Pearson said: ‘The first I knew about it was when I was stabbed in the back. I turned and saw it was Joe. ‘I saw his eyes and he looked absolutely furious. The first blow pushed me to the floor and he kicked me and was trying to drag me along into the Catacombs. That was where it was going to end. I tried to get free. I felt another kick and stab from behind. ‘I thought this is going to go on until I am dead. He was deranged and so evil. I had six stab wounds in total on my back. ‘I remember seeing the scissors and turning my head and seeing them come down. I saw his eyes were full of murder. He definitely wanted me to die. ‘I was struggling and screaming and pleading. I remember saying, “Please, Joe, no”. He never spoke to me throughout the whole thing.’ Asked at Exeter Crown Court if she felt let down by the police’s failure to catch her stalker, she replied: ‘Of course I did.’ She recounted numerous incidents of intimidation committed by Willis, including her bike tyres being slashed, phone calls, ‘frightening text messages, anonymous horrible letters, broken windows, many instances of damage to my car, graffiti on the walls and pavements in my street and instances during the night when my door was banged or had paint thrown at it.’ 'Let down': Miss Pearson criticised Devon and Cornwall Police's handling of her case which was only bought to court after Willis launched the physical attack in a cemetery . She told the court: ‘I became more and more afraid, not knowing what the stalker would do next. I imagined he would attack and rape me. ‘Stalking is an apt name for what I was dealing with as I felt like an animal being constantly hunted. ‘Ordinary life was impossible. Finding a dead cat on my doorstep was heart-breaking and I feared it was a warning. ‘I was convinced the stalker was going to kill me but I felt powerless to do anything about it. ‘I felt let down by the authorities that should have been there to help me, that no one cared and that I was a nuisance. I was shocked.’ Willis later turned his attentions to her parents’ home, causing damage, phoning them, and sending malicious letters. He even sent their neighbours a letter pretending to be from the Pearsons saying they ran sex parties. The couple have now lodged an official complaint against Devon and Cornwall Police. Judge Paul Darlow told Willis, who had denied the charge but admitted wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm, he faced an ‘inevitably lengthy sentence’. Detective Inspector Mike Robison defended the way police had dealt with scores of reports of harassment during the five years in which Willis stalked his victim before the attack. He said the force is carrying out an internal review which has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. He said: ‘This case has been hugely testing for Helen Pearson and her family and they can hopefully move on with their lives as a result of the verdict.’","Helen Pearson, 34, was subjected to a campaign of abuse by Joe Willis, 49 .

"An American company has created a wristband that uses a form of shock therapy to encourage the development of good habits. It is called Pavlok. The product is branded as a 'personal coach on your wrist' and can even be used to help stop overeating. Pavlok is worn as a wristband and can be activated manually or automatically, according to The Telegraph. The idea behind the shocking invention is that the two milliampere shock will condition wearers to develop and stick to good habits by associating the bad habits with the uncomfortable yet effective shock. Scroll down for video . Track: The Pavlok wristband can track your movement - and give you a mild electric shock in an effort to encourage the promotion of good habits . Inspired: Pavlok creator Maneesh Sethi was inspired to create the rubber wristband by Pavlov's famous classical conditioning experiment where dogs were trained to expect food each time they heard a bell ring . Sound familiar? Pavlok creator Maneesh Sethi was inspired to create the rubber wristband by Pavlov's famous classical conditioning experiment where dogs were trained to expect food each time they heard a bell ring, according to The Daily Dot. 'By adding a shock while you eat, you train your lizard brain to associate the act of eating (or the type of food) with the shock—and it can effectively limit the drive for mindless eating that you normally have,' Sethi told The Dot. Behavior: The band locks together on the wrist, allowing it to give a small shock to the wearer to 'reinforce' their behavior . Journalist EJ Dickson of The Dot put the wristband to the test during the year's most gluttonous of holidays: Thanksgiving. Dickson strapped on the wristband before Thanksgiving dinner and, though Sethi reportedly assured Dickson the shock was not painful, the journalist begged to differ. 'It felt like someone was plucking out my arm hair with a pair of pincers,' Dickson wrote. Dickson wrote of the shock 'It makes you ask yourself, wait, why am I hungry again?' Dickson did not overeat that Thanksgiving day, according to The Dot, but the journalist was not sure if that was a result of the Pavlok. However, Dickson wrote that the Pavlok may undoubtedly work as a back-up plan to sheer willpower. Dickson remains wary of shock therapy, according to The Dot, but admitted that the wristband was at least somewhat effective because 'I was more than able to button each button of my pants.' The Telegraph reports that the wristband is expected to go on sale next year for $244. According to the Pavlok website, the wristband helps to transform wearers and promotes change. 'I like to say that for the last 1,000 years, we’ve tamed environment, but we haven’t tamed ourselves, Sethi said. The wristband acts as a helping agent in the 'taming.' '...change isn't impossible,' the website states. 'Choose your daily action, and Pavlok will hold you accountable, ensuring lasting success.' 'It's not about the shock as much as it is about training your brain to do the things you say you're going to do,' Sethi told Boston.com. Negative reinforcement 'really does make people pay attention,' he said. Creator: Pavlok creator Maneesh Sethi hit headlines in 2012 when he advertised on Craigslist for someone to slap him if he became distracted . Hack: A self-proclaimed 'digital nomad,' Sethi's most recent endeavor is his 'Hack the System' campaign, which features numerous posts including exercise, travel, productivity, and money-making hacks. According to website,'Pavlok offers a simple, wearable device that helps consumers form better habits. 'Using psychologically proven and user tested algorithms, the Pavlok wristband enforces users’ commitments to fitness, productivity, and more — even if that means 'sparking' their commitment by delivering a mild (but jolting) electric shock.' Although the firm hasn't revealed exactly how it works, it say 'Pavlok combines accurate tracking capabilities, powerful commitment techniques, and ‘on-your-wrist’ reminder triggers to change users’ brains and form the habits they wish they had. 'Through our proprietary negative and positive reinforcement technique, Pavlok doesn’t simply nudge someone to change their behavior - it pushes them to transform themselves and form the habit to maintain their transformation.' In 2012, Sethi hit the headlines when he advertised on Craigslist for someone to slap him if he became distracted. I figured, 'This is stupid, why am I wasting this time doing nothing? When I have a boss, or someone of authority watching me, I always get my work done. How can I simulate the authority figure? 'Naturally, I believe that an authority figure should have real authority.

DMS.Article.init('top'); . }); . It has been revealed that the overwhelming majority of Americans are unable to properly identify the leading television news anchor. Brian Williams has hosted NBC's Nightly News for nearly a decade and the show was the top rated evening broadcast in the 2012-2013 season, but Pew Research Center did a study to see what that meant in terms of recognition. Only 27 per cent of respondents to an online survey identified Williams correctly- and some even thought that he was Vice President Joe Biden. Then and now: Nearly half of respondents in 1985 could identify CBS' Dan Rather (left) but only a quarter could name NBC's Brian Williams (right) News men: While most picked Williams (left) some other respondents confused him with former anchors Dan Rather (center left) and Tom Brokaw (right), though none thought he was Walter Cronkite (center right), seen together in 2004 . These findings mark a dramatic decrease the public's knowledge of news anchors, as a similar survey done in 1985 showed that nearly half of respondents were able to correctly identify Dan Rather, who at the time was the anchor for that year's top rated news program on CBS. The survey effectively quantified the common understanding that television news viewership has dropped over the past two decades. The News Consumption Survey in 2012 reported that viewership across all age groups- including the typically strong demographic of those over 50-years-old- was effectively cut in half between 1992 and 2012. This latest Pew survey had 1,052 participants and revealed that the few that were able to come up with an alternative choices, 2 per cent said Joe Biden and 1 per cent said Mitt Romney. Other guesses were closer to the mark- . maybe not in looks but in field- as other journalists like Williams' predecessor Tom Brokaw, Ted Koppel, Peter Jennings and even Rather were . given as possible answers. Another 3 per cent were unable to think of his name, and were only able to identify him as a news anchor or reporter. Going down: TV news viewership has dropped dramatically since Dan Rather was on the air . Younger fans: Some know Williams because of his daughter Alison (right) who is one of the stars of HBO's Girls . The results are extra shocking because Williams has one of the youngest demographics when it comes to followers as his forays while removed from the news desk have made him popular among younger viewers. He regularly makes guest appearances on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon as part of the ongoing skit where he 'slow jams' the news and has been a host of Saturday Night Live. Most recently, he appeared on the red carpet in support of his daughter, Alison, who is one of the stars of HBO's series Girls. Williams isn't the only news anchor who may be dealing with a bruised ego today, as Fox's Megyn Kelly was featured as a question on Jeopardy but none of the contestants were able to name her.","Only 27 per cent of survey respondents accurately identified the NBC news man .

"Pilots flying in to Beijing from China's 10 busiest airports will be required to know how to land 'blind' because the smog there has got so bad. From the New Year, the country's civil aviation authority will require the pilots of even small commercial airlines to be able to land using just their instruments on hazy days. The move is aimed at easing delays at Beijing Capital International Airport, which has had the worst flight delays out of 35 international airports. Pilots flying from Hongqiao airport in Shanghai (pictured) to Beijing will be required to be able to land 'blind' under new rules . China's Civil Aviation Administration of China announced the change which will require pilots to have a 'blind landing category 2' certification allowing them to land in poor visibility, CNN reported. A CAAC source told the China Daily: 'It is part of a series of measures the administration took recently to raise flights' on-time performance.' China's toxic smog problem has become international news in the last week as thick smog blanketed cities and forced schools to close. The latest bout of smog in Beijing and Shanghai led to the cancellation or delay of hundreds of flights, stranding passengers and creating chaos at airports.

Choking: A man wears a face mask while walking on the Bund in downtown Shanghai this morning . Last week, in a bungled attempt to play down the problem, state media tried to make a joke of it. Two of China's most influential news outlets suggested that the dense smog, which is so thick it has reduced visibility to just a few feet in places, can teach people about meteorology and help them learn new jokes to cope in the crisis. Chinese state controlled broadcaster CCTV and the widely read tabloid the Global Times, published by the Communist Party's official People's Daily, both tried to put a positive spin on the problem. The Global Times said smog could be useful in military situations, as it could hinder the use of guided missiles, while CCTV listed five 'unforeseen rewards' for smog, including helping Chinese people's sense of humour. Both pieces have since been deleted from their websites, but not before bloggers posted copies of the controversial articles online.","Airline pilots will need to be able to land using just their instruments .

"Setting the stage for imminent military intervention in Syria, Secretary of State John Kerry said Friday that the U.S. has 'high confidence' that Syrian President Bashar Assad carried out a chemical weapons attack against citizens. Calling Assad a 'thug' and a 'murderer,' he declared, 'History would judge us all extraordinarily harshly if we turned a blind . eye to a dictator’s use of chemical weapons.' 'The primary question is really no longer, what do we know,' he said. 'The question is... what are we in the world going to about it?' Kerry said the credibility and security of the U.S. and its allies are at stake. 'Some cite the risk of doing things,' he said. But we need to ask, “What is the risk of doing nothing?”' In . a veiled reference to the British Parliament's vote Thursday to opt out . of military intervention in Syria, Kerry said the U.S. is not afraid to . act alone. Secretary of State John Kerry delivers remarks on Syria at the State Department in Washington on Friday . President Obama said Friday tha the is considering 'limited, narrow' military action against Syria . 'President Obama . will ensure that the United States of America makes our . own decisions on our own timelines, based on our values and our . interests,' he said. 'Now, we know that after a decade of conflict, the . American people are tired of war. Believe me, I am, too. But fatigue . does not absolve us of our responsibility.' He said the U.S. should also feel confident that it has the backing of a number of other nations, including Turkey, Australia, the Arab League and what he called America's 'oldest ally,' France. Shortly after Kerry's remarks, President Obama said he is considering a 'limited, narrow act' against Syria. 'We're not considering any open-ended commitment,' he told reporters in brief remarks at the White House. 'We're not considering any boots-on-the-ground approach.' Half of Americans say they oppose taking . military action against Syria and nearly 80 percent believe Obama should . seek congressional approval before using any force, according to a new . NBC poll. The administration supplemented . Kerry's remarks Friday with the release of an intelligence report that . concludes 1,429 people were killed in the attack, including 426 . children. 'It’s findings are as clear as they are compelling,' Kerry said of the findings. The . report concludes with 'high confidence,' short of actual confirmation, . that the Syrian government carried out the chemical weapons attack. 'Our high confidence assessment is the . strongest position that the U.S. Intelligence Community can take short . of confirmation,' the report says. 'We intercepted communications involving a senior official intimately familiar with the offensive who confirmed that chemical weapons were used by the regime on August 21 and was concerned with the U.N. inspectors obtaining evidence,' the report continues. 'On the afternoon of August 21, we have intelligence that Syrian chemical weapons personnel were directed to cease operations.' The White House has released this map detailing its understanding of the areas where chemical weapons have been used .

United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said the inspection team in Syria is expected to complete its work by today . British Prime Minister David Cameron failed to secure Parliament's backing for military intervention in Syria . The findings also claim that Assad is the 'ultimate decision maker' for Syria's chemical weapons program and that his regime has used the weapons on a smaller scale against citizens several times in the past year. 'This assessment is based on multiple streams of information including reporting of Syrian officials planning and executing chemical weapons attacks and laboratory analysis of physiological samples obtained from a number of individuals, which revealed exposure to sarin,' the report says. 'We assess that the opposition has not used chemical weapons.' Sarin is a type of nerve gas. The report further reveals evidence that the regime had been preparing chemical weapons in the three days prior to the attacks and protected themselves using gas masks. 'Syrian chemical weapons personnel were operating in the Damascus suburb of 'Adra from Sunday, August 18 until early in the morning on Wednesday, August 21, near an area that the regime uses to mix chemical weapons, including sarin,' the report says. The report also cited evidence that the attacks were launched from regime-controlled areas into opposition territory or contested areas. Several senior officials related before the release of the report that the intelligence was 'not a slam dunk' in terms of tying Assad's regime to the use of chemical weapons. The . term 'slam dunk' is a reference to the then-CIA Director George Tenet's . assurance in 2002 that assessments showing that Iraq had weapons of . mass destruction was a 'slam dunk.' Death toll: Hundreds died in the alleged chemical attacks, including many women and children . 'Evidence': Secretary of State John Kerry said images like these contributed to the U.S. assessment that chemical weapons were used in Syria . Calling Assad a 'thug' and a 'murderer,' John Kerry declared, 'History would judge us all extraordinarily harshly if we turned a blind eye to a dictator's use of chemical weapons.' Kerry assured on Friday that the U.S. will not repeat the mistakes of the Iraq war. 'We are more than mindful of the Iraq experience,' Kerry said. 'We will not repeat that moment.' He later added: 'Whatever decision [Obama] makes in Syria it will bear no resemblance to Afghanistan, Iraq or even Libya. It will not involve any boots on the ground. It will not be open ended. And it will not assume responsibility for a civil war that is already well underway.' The administration briefed members of Congress on a conference call Thursday evening to explain its conclusion that Bashar Assad's government was guilty of carrying out a suspected chemical attack on August 21. Following the call, House Democratic . leader, Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, sided with Republican Speaker . John Boehner of Ohio in urging the administration to engage with the . full Congress on the matter.

"Brianna Wu called police following a series of violent tweets from an account named 'Death to Brianna' A female games developer has been forced to flee her home after a Twitter user posted her address on the social networking site and threatened to rape her. Brianna Wu, developer of sci-fi action puzzler Revolution 60, called police following a series of violent tweets from an account named 'Death to Brianna.' The anonymous person behind the online attack made it clear that they were doing so because of her outspoken support of women in tech and gaming. The bio of the account, which has now been suspended, read: 'I'm going to kill Brianna Wu and her husband Frank.' One of the tweets Wu received on Friday night spoke about raping and choking her, while another threatened to kill any children she had. Most of the tweets were too graphic for MailOnline to publish. The last tweet publicly published Wu's home address and in response Wu, head of development for the indie video game publisher Giant Spacekat, contacted Arlington police.

"Just weeks after publicly claiming that former first lady Hillary Clinton was waging a 'war on women' by enabling her husband's philandering ways, the aide who accused the former president of groping her in the White House has penned an article for a far-right-wing blog under the headline 'America Deserves Better Than the Clintons.' Kathleen Willey was a Democratic fundraiser volunteering in the White House during Bill Clinton's presidency who claims the former president kissed and groped her inside a private study off of the Oval Office. Now, with a potential presidential run by Hillary Clinton in the works, Willey has resurfaced to warn the American public about the 'dysfunctional' former first family. Kathleen Willey accused former President Bill Clinton of sexually harassing her. Now she says America 'deserves better' than another Clinton presidency . The basis for much of Willey's latest criticism of the Clintons stems from Hillary Clinton's handling of the attack in Benghazi, Libya, that led to the deaths of four Americans, including ambassador Chris Stevens. 'The last time we saw Hillary Clinton as . our secretary of state, she was testifying before a congressional . committee about Benghazi,' Willey writes in the column published on WND.com. 'During that meeting on Jan. 22, 2013, we heard . her shriek, “What difference does it make?"" 'Earlier, right . before one of the presidential debates, on Oct. 15, 2012, Hillary stated . during a series of interviews that she, as secretary of state, was . responsible for the security of the embassy staff. “The buck stops . here.” 'I remember being so surprised when I heard it, but I was immediately suspicious,' Willey concludes. Willey qualifies her shock by claiming that 'taking responsibility for anything is rare' for the Clintons. She goes on to say the former secretary of state knows more than she's willing to reveal about the Benghazi attack. 'If it is revealed . that she played a major part in the demise of our four patriots, as we . suspect she did, she might want to consider retreating from public life . once and for all and, together with her husband, play the role of senior . stateswoman,' she writes. Willey concludes her commentary by simply stating that 'we deserve better' than the Clintons. In February, Willey made claims that when she was secretary of state, Hillary Clinton orchestrated a series of investigations designed to discredit the many women who have claimed her husband sexually assaulted them . 'The point is what this woman is capable of doing to other women while she's running a campaign, basically, on women's issues,' she said. 'It just doesn't make any sense.' 'She single-handedly orchestrated every one of the investigations of all these women.' Willey said the president groped her after she approached him for a paying job in the White House instead of her volunteer position . Willey (L) and Juanita Broddrick (R) both claim Bill Clinton sexually assaulted them. Broddrick's allegations include her insistence that the former president raped her in 1978, but she has changed her story several times . Kathleen Willey describes a 1990s Clinton White House where the president conducted numerous sexual flings and the first lady -- who may run for president herself -- enabled his lifestyle by targeting his female accusers with investigations . She suspects Hillary Clinton of covering up 'nothing short of serious sexual harassment' in her case. And addressing claims by some Democrats that Republican politicians are conducting a so-called 'war on women' through their social policies, Willey turned the notion on its head. 'Hillary Clinton is the war on women, and that's what needs to be exposed here!' she exclaimed. WND.com first reported that Willey told WABC host Aaron Klein that Mrs. Clinton is 'addicted to power, and she saw early on that [Bill] could be a powerful candidate. He had a lot of charisma. And she could just ride on his coattails.' Talking about the her allegations against Bill Clinton, she reiterated Sunday that 'the president sexually assaulted me,' leading her to 'the little room where he and Monica [Lewinsky] used to meet.' 'I started to go for the door and he was right behind me,' she recalled, 'and things went from bad to worse there. He acted just very inappropriately. He just did. I was shocked and bewildered, and I thought to myself, ""What in the world is he doing?""' Willey claims Bill Clinton, an old friend whose Virginia campaign organization she and her husband founded, 'was very intense. He's big. He's much bigger than I am.' Following Willey's news-making allegations in 1998 on the CBS program 60 Minutes, the Clinton White House released a series of letters and phone messages, sent after the alleged 1993 sexual harassment, which seemed to show Willey had a friendly outlook toward the president, and wanted more contact – not less. A federal judge later ruled that President Clinton had 'committed a criminal violation' of the Privacy Act by making her letters public. He was not prosecuted for it. And Linda Tripp, a one-time friend of Clinton paramour Monica Lewinsky, testified in a grand jury proceeding that Willey pursued Clinton, and not the other way around. But Willey maintains that she was a victim, and has even claimed the Clintons had her second husband murdered on November 29, 1993, the same day the president allegedly forced himself on her. The death was ruled a suicide, but she said Sunday that twenty years later government agencies refuse to let her see files detailing the investigation. Willey was a prolific Democratic fundraiser who co-founded Virginians for Clinton to help get him elected, but she would later turn on him after what she says was a sexual assault near the Oval Office . The botched Benghazi terror-attack aftermath isn't the only hurdle between Hillary Clinton and the White House: Foreign powers may believe she can be deceived and fooled because her husband was a serial cheater . Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, an all-but-certain presidential contender, said in January that although Bill Clinton's presidency was marked by 'predatory behavior, it's not fair to blame his wife for letting it continue. 'It’s not Hillary's fault,' he told Vogue magazine, 'but it is a factor in judging Bill Clinton in history ... sometimes it's hard to separate one from the other.' Willey had no problem focusing her venom on Hillary, though. It's her likely presidential candidacy that's bringing the former president's sexual flings back into the news. 'Just pack your bags. You’ve had your 15 minutes,' she slapped at Hillary. 'Stop forcing us to have to look at this stuff again. We're sick of it.' But Willey also had harsh words for feminist groups that seem insistent on making Mrs. Clinton the first female U.S. president. 'All of these women's groups, they're all pro-Hillary,' she said. 'They need to ... talk to someone like me and listen here, what Hillary Clinton has done to me and many, many, many other women.' 'They are so hypocritical, it's unbelievable,' she claimed. 'And this is the woman that wants to be president.'","Kathleen Willey was a Democratic fundraiser volunteering in the White House when she says Bill Clinton kissed her passionately and groped her .

"The poster child for what Democrats claim is a GOP 'war on women' lashed out at Hillary Clinton on Wednesday in exclusive comments to MailOnline, calling her 'hypocritical' for defending a child rapist in 1975 and laughing about it in a taped interview. Former Missouri Republican Rep. Todd Akin crashed and burned in his 2012 bid for a U.S. Senate seat, after claiming that exceptions in abortion bans for rape victims weren't necessary because 'if it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.' 'But let’s assume that maybe that didn’t work or something: I think there should be some punishment,' he said ten weeks before that election, 'but the punishment ought to be of the rapist, and not attacking the child.' Akin . emerged from 18 months of media silence to double down on those . comments, and to blast the leading Democratic presidential contender . with a blistering verbal salvo. Scroll down for video . 'Legitimate rape': Todd Akin insists he was right about the rarity of pregnancy caused by rape, and is attacking Hillary Clinton for her role in marginalizing her husband's sexual-assault accusers . Double standard? Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton defended the rapist of a 12-year-old girl in 1975, winning him a 'time served' sentence of just two months in jail . Akin says he hasn't rule out running for office again, and may be laying the groundwork with a new book explaining his epic collapse in 2012 . 'It . is incredibly hypocritical that Hillary Clinton would carry on about an . imagined ""Republican war on women"",' the former six-term congressman . told MailOnline, 'when she once got a child rapist off the hook who she . knew to be guilty, and laughed about how she did it when interviewed.' 'In . the process, she de-legitimized the legitimate claims of the . 12-year-old victim and then slandered the victim to justify her . tactics.' Clinton was embarrassed ten days ago when the Washington Free Beacon published an audio interview from the early 1980s in which she chuckled about representing a man who raped a 12-year-old girl. She knew he was guilty, she said on the recording, but worked the legal system to limit his punishment to 'time served' – about two months in jail. 'I had him take a polygraph, which he passed – which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs,' she laughed at the time. Todd Akin is ending his nearly two years of silence after his comments about 'legitmate rape' ended his U.S. Senate hopes in Missouri, pushing a book and attacking Hillary Clinton in the process . Akin . complained to MailOnline about a decades-long pattern of Hillary . Clinton making light of sexual assaults by attacking the victims. The future first lady ran a legal aid clinic when she . took the case in 1975. In an affidavit on behalf of Thomas Alfred Taylor, who died in . 1992, she described his child victim as 'emotionally unstable with a . tendency to seek out older men and engage in fantasizing,' and wrote . that she had a history of 'false accusations.' Akin . pointed to Clinton's actions during her husband's 1992 presidential . campaign to marginalize women who accused him of sexual abuse, as . evidence that establishes a pattern. 'She . hired private . investigators to silence those women – ‘bimbo eruptions’ in Clintonspeak . – who had been seduced or sexually assaulted by her husband,' Akin . told MailOnline. Those cases involved accusations from women including Paula Jones, who accused the future president of sexually harassing her, and Juanita Broaddrick, who leveled charges that he violently raped her. 'Hillary Clinton, in . fact, has made a practice of trashing women with legitimate claims to . having been assaulted,' Akin said. 'I faced a media firestorm for an unclear comment. It is the responsibility of the media to make it clear that liberal . Democrats like Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton are the true . perpetrators of the ‘war on women.' Akin, like Clinton, is promoting a book – Firing Back: Taking on the Party Bosses and Media Elite to Protect Our Faith and Freedom – due in stores on July 15. The book includes a carefully parsed defense of his 'legitimate rape' comment to a television station that doomed his 2012 campaign and brought even GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney out of the woodwork to chastise him. 'When a woman claims to have been raped, the police . determine if the evidence supports the legal definition of ""rape"",' Akin writes. 'Is it . a legitimate claim of rape or an excuse to avoid an unwanted pregnancy? Are the police warranted to take action against a crime or not?' 'In . short, the word ""legitimate"" modifies the claim and not the action. There have been women who have lied about being raped, as Norman . McCorvey did before the U.S. Supreme Court. The infamous Roe v. Wade . decision of 1973 was based on a lie.' 'My comment about a woman's body . shutting the pregnancy down,' Akin adds in the book, 'was directed to the impact of stress on . fertilization. This is something fertility doctors debate and discuss. Doubt me? Google ""stress and fertilization,"" and you will find a library . of research on the subject.' 'The research is not conclusive, but there . is considerable evidence that stress makes conception more difficult. And what could be more stressful than a rape?' Akin told MailOnline that he hasn't closed the door on running for office again in the future. 'I have not ruled out the possibility of running for office again in the future, but it is not on my radar at the moment,' he said Wednesday. Backlash: Akin faced an angry feminist lobby in 2012 after his gaffe became the subject of daily outrage in the press . Crash and burn: Akin's solid lead over Sen. Claire McCaskill evaporated, along with much of his public following, after his shocking gaffe about rape and pregnancy . That position casts his dissection of his 2012 implosion in a different light. He insists, for instance, that he . never denied the possibility of pregnancy from forcible rape. 'In . fact, several fantastic young Americans who campaigned with me were . themselves the products of rape,' Akin writes. 'And they were thankful I . would stand with them.' Akin's full-contact body slam on Hillary Clinton is about what he sees as a double standard. He was pilloried in 2012 for putting his foot in his mouth by answering a hypothetical question, he says, while Clinton has largely escaped criticism for defending Taylor, an actual rapist. The 12-year-old victim, now a middle-age woman, told The Daily Beast last week that 'Hillary Clinton took me through hell,' adding that she would confront the former secretary of state if she had the chance. 'I would say [to Clinton], ""You took a case of mine in '75, you lied on me… I realize the truth now, the heart of what you’ve done to me"",' she said. 'And you are supposed to be for women? You call that [being] for women, what you done to me? And I hear you on tape laughing.' Assaulter-in-chief? Then-President Bill Clinton faced questions from reporters in 1999 after Juanita Broaddrick, an Arkansas woman, accused him of raping her 21 years earlier in a hotel room . Broaddrick gave an NBC News interview in 1999 describing what she said was a brutal sexual assault and Bill Clinton's alleged cavalier attitude afterward . 'Bimbo eruption': Hillary Clinton helped tamp down national outrage after a string of women, including Paul Jones (pictured) accused Bill Clinton of sexual harassment and sexual assault . Akin writes in 'Firing Back' that two weeks after his 'legitimate rape' comment became national news, 'sexual . predator' Bill Clinton received a standing ovation . for his keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention. At he same convention, he adds, Democrats memorialized Ted Kennedy, whose Chappaquiddick incident brought charges that he let a . young woman he preyed on drown to save his reputation. If Akin runs again, he'll need a resurgence of support from Christian evangelicals, many of whom abandoned him in the final weeks of the 2012 campaign. His book seems calculated, in part, to rebuild that bridge. 'Perhaps one of the greatest opportunities to return to good ideas and refute bad ideas is through the church,' he writes. 'Churches exist in part to warn people of the bad consequences of bad ideas and teach obedience to God’s laws. ... Today, for all the good work our pastors do, many make the mistake of not applying the Bible to the critical issues of our day. This is probably one of the most urgently needed changes in America.'","Akin said in 2012 that abortion bans didn't need to include exceptions for rape victims because 'legitimate rape' rarely leads to conception .
The comment became a national rallying cry for claims of a GOP 'war on women' and caused his campaign to crash and burn .
Akin is attacking Hillary Clinton in his first interview since the campaign implosion, saying she 'de-legitimized' a 12-year-old rape victim by defending her attacker in court .
He insists he was right about his ill-fated 2012 comments, and claims there's a double standard at play that benefits the Clintons .
Hillary, he claims in a new book, ' has made a practice of trashing women with legitimate claims to having been assaulted' – including shutting down 'bimbo eruptions' during her husband's 1992 presidential campaign ."

Tampa Bay Lightning left wing Ryan Malone was arrested early Saturday morning and charged with DUI and cocaine possession. Malone, 34, was pulled over only blocks from the teams arena just before 3.30 a.m. after police saw his SUV hit a curb. Cops said they smelled alcohol on his breath and found 1.3 grams of cocaine in one of his back pockets. The 10-year pro was released only hours later after posting bond, but he did not make the team trip to Washington, D.C., for the team's Sunday game against the Capitals. Malone refused to take field sobriety tests, but a breath test given at the jail recorded blood alcohol levels of 0.112 and 0.116 percent, a police spokesperson said. Florida law considers a driver impaired at 0.08. Malone was released from the Hillsborough County jail on $2,500 bond. Jail records did not list an attorney.

"Two out of three families are resorting to a ‘staycation’ this summer as the squeeze on household budgets makes foreign holidays unaffordable, a study has found. The number of Britons holidaying in the UK rose from 35 per cent to 41 per cent between 2011 and 2012, and this year is expected to jump to 65 per cent. The study found Cornwall had been overtaken as a staycation hotspot by London, Edinburgh and the Lake District. 'Staycationers' are snubbing Cornwall, left, in favour of destinations including Edinburgh, new research shows . London, with sights including St Paul's Cathedral, tops a new poll of where those holidaying at home want to go . The survey found 42 per cent of . staycationers will holiday for one week this summer, 15 per cent for two . weeks, and a third will have three short domestic breaks. Those in Wolverhampton, Liverpool, . Cardiff, Chelmsford and Manchester were most likely to stay in Britain, . according to the study, commissioned by Travelodge. The hotel chain says the staycation . surge will boost the UK tourism industry by £3.3billion compared with . last year, making it worth a total of £12billion. However, a separate study published by Thomas Cook suggests Britain is not the cheap option many believe it to be. It found that in the UK, a basket of . typical holiday purchases – from a glass of wine to a meal and ice cream . – costs £125.74, making it the second most expensive destination after . Sydney, Australia, at £157.96. However, the survey did not include travel and accommodation, which is where those who holiday at home make big savings. The charms of the Lake District mean that it is near the top of the list for those choosing to stay in the UK . The staycation research was . commissioned by Travelodge, which has an interest in people staying in . the UK, however it was based on an online poll of 3,000 people conducted . by a third party company called OnePoll. The boost in 'staycations' could make for a very different set of holiday snaps . The . hotel chain claims that the surge in people taking a holiday at home . will boost the UK tourism industry by £3.3billion compared to last year, . taking the total to £12 billion. The study found that 42per cent of the staycationers will taking a one week holiday in the UK this summer, 15per cent are indulging in a two week break and a third will take three short domestic breaks. People in Wolverhampton, Liverpool, Cardiff, Chelmsford and Manchester were most likely to say they are holidaying at home this summer. Chief executive of Travelodge, Grant Hearn, said: ‘The staycation trend accelerating to record levels and boosting our economy by £12 billion this year, is a  very welcome sign, and hopefully this is the start of our 2012 Olympics legacy gain. ‘During 2012, our capital city was showcased in its true glory to all corners of the UK and the world, and it’s a great result that London has been crowned as the top staycation destination for 2013.’ However, he said the government is failing to capitalise of the UK’s tourism potential and suggested the Department for Culture, Media Sport, which is run by Tory Secretary of State Maria Miller, it at fault. He said: ‘We are not yet near to . unlocking the true potential of our industry. British tourism needs to . be treated like a serious business sector and  the Government needs to . move our industry from the ineffective Department of Culture Media & . Sports to the Department for Business, Innovation & Skills. The success of last year's London Olympics has encouraged more people to stay at home for their holiday . ‘Lack of immediate action is costing jobs, growth and investment.’ The Thomas Cook study put the cost of a basket of holiday purchases in the UK at £125.74, which was the second most expensive behind the £157.96 for Sydney, Australia. The cheapest short-haul option was Tenerife at £47.28 for the same basket of goods. Tunisia came in at £52.86, while Egypt is also cheap at £54.07 and even Florida was much less than Britain at £59.25. The holiday companies have seen a big increase in the sale of all-inclusive packages, where all meals and drinks are included in the headline price, as a direct result of the squeeze on household budgets. Joanna Wild, the Thomas Cook retail director, said despite the nation’s money troubles: ‘An overseas holiday offers exceptional value for money, whatever board basis our customers choose, given that prices in many resorts abroad are considerably cheaper than in the UK.’ She said all-inclusive deals now account for more than half of all holidays they sell and are particularly popular with families.","The number of people staying at home this year has risen to 65 per cent .

"Former Manchester United striker Javier Hernandez 'is a phenomenon' according to Real Madrid legend, and fellow Mexican, Hugo Sanchez. Chicharito scored his first two Real Madrid goals in the 8-2 thrashing of Deportivo on Saturday, and the first in particular was a wonderful strike. And Sanchez, who scored over 200 goals for Real, told Spanish paper AS that the striker can lead the line for the European champions ahead of Karim Benzema. Real Madrid's dominant 8-2 win is the big story in Spain, with Marca claiming Ancelotti has the solutions . 'He scored two great goals and I'm sure he will score many in Madrid,' Sanchez told AS. 'He's a phenomenon. '[He is] very fast, intuitive, with movement and speed and he shoots well with his left and his right and his head. 'Il fenomeno', or 'the phenomenon' was the nickname given to Brazilian striker Ronaldo, who was one of the first era of galacticos and scored 83 La Liga goals in his four and a half seasons at the club. But Sanchez justified his praise by saying that, with confidence, Hernandez can be Real's first choice striker. 'He is a player who intercepts the opponent very well and visualises what's happening next. What he needs to win a place under [Real coach] Carlo Ancelotti is what he did at Riazor. Confidence comes with goals. 'When he's given more time and more chances, hopefully he will be as effective as is required in Madrid. 'In this team there are enough chances created and that will help.' 'Benzema has quality and talent but his effectiveness percentage is not what you would expect from a centre forward' Barcelona's thrashing of Levante keeps their perfect start to the season going, with Lionel Messi in top form . Elsewhere in Spain Marca suggest Carlo Ancelotti has found a solution to Real Madrid's poor start by withdrawing a playmaker in central midfield. The Madrid-based paper also brands Manchester United 'ridiculous' with a picture of their loan signing Falcao, who was a long-term target for Real Madrid. The Barcelona press lavish praise upon Luis Enrique's side after they thrashed Levante 5-0. Mundo Deportivo describe the performance as a recital, saying 'Barca rout with a brilliant Messi, incomparable Neymar, and an indispensable Rakitic'. Sport meanwhile focus on Barca's brilliant start to the league season, with the Catalan giants yet to concede a goal, having scored 11 times in their four consecutive wins. Tuttosport say there's still plenty of Juve while Corriere dello Sport believe only Roma can stop the Old Lady . In Italy the focus is on the two sides with a 100% record as both Roma and Juventus continued their good start to the season. 'There's still plenty of Juve' says Tuttosport as the Serie A champions boast four wins out of four in all competitions without Pirlo, Vidal, Barzagli or Morata, and without conceding a goal. Corriere dello Sport focuses on their title rivals Roma, who also won again this weekend, saying only Rudi Garcia's side can stop Juventus winning yet another title. L'equipe declares a state of emergency at Zlatan Ibrahimovic's PSG while Nani scores again in Protugal . French paper L'Equipe declare a 'State of Emergency' for PSG on their front page after they could only manage a 1-1 draw with Lyon. The French champions, who spent £50m on David Luiz this summer, are three points off the pace already, and L'Equipe says the poor performances of Zlatan Ibrahimovic alone cannot explain the malaise. In Portugal the papers lead with convincing wins for Sporting and Benfica, with Manchester United loanee Nani on the scoresheet for the Lisbon side.","Real Madrid praised after 8-2 thrashing of Deportivo La Coruna .

"British Gas is mounting an extraordinary attempt to hijack efforts by consumers to contact its rivals. A partnership with the 118 118 directory enquiry service means callers asking for the number of any energy company are met with a hard sell for British Gas. The 118 118 operator is required to highlight one of its fixed energy tariffs and talk up an incentive of a £50 high street shopping voucher. The same operator even offers to connect customers who had originally intended to contact a rival to British Gas sales staff. Plug: One of 118 118's television adverts. The new partnership means that the operator is required to highlight one of its fixed energy tariffs and talk up an incentive of a £50 high street shopping voucher . So a consumer who might originally have been trying to contact a small and cheap firm such as Ovo Energy is pushed towards British Gas instead. The partnership between British Gas and 118 118 raises new questions about whether consumers can trust the Big Six energy firms to deal fairly with consumers amid allegations of rip-off prices and poor service. Recent price rises mean that the cost of dialling 118 118 is hugely expensive, with a minimum charge from a landline ranging from £4.45 to £5.68. This bill can rise sharply if the call lasts any longer than necessary. And those dialling the service pay a fee to get a specific number, so they do not expect to be hit with an advertising message from a third party which may well increase the cost of the call. Worse still, if connected to British Gas via 118 118 they are then charged £2.57 a minute. Marc Gander, of the Consumer Action Group, said: ‘I suppose it’s hardly surprising. Two companies, each with a controversial reputation over pricing, finding comfort in each other’s company. ‘The 118 118 service doesn’t offer value for money so our simple advice is don’t bother to dial the directory service. ‘You save money and you don’t have to listen to British Gas advertising. Two birds of a feather with one stone. Simple.’ Energy firms have run into severe trouble over mis-selling. In July British Gas was ordered to pay £1million to customers after selling energy deals to shoppers in Sainsbury’s stores using misleading claims about possible savings. It has lost hundreds of thousands of customers in the past 18 months as families switch to cheaper independent rivals. The deal being promoted by 118 118 involves fixing energy tariffs until the end of March 2016. It suggests this will lead to an average annual bill of £1,193 and comes with a £50 High Street gift voucher. However, cheaper fixed rate deals are available. Ovo Energy, for example, has a 12-month deal with an annual average bill of £1,011. British Gas said: ‘British Gas advertises in a variety of ways, including this type of paid-for promotion. It is similar to paying for adverts that appear on the internet alongside search engine results.’ The 118 118 service is operated by The Number, a subsidiary of US directory enquiries provider Knowledge Generation Bureau.A spokesman said: ‘When customers request a specific number, our call agents always supply it quickly and accurately. ‘Occasionally we have some great special offers that are related to their enquiry. Fair? The partnership between British Gas and 118 118 raises new questions about whether consumers can trust the Big Six energy firms to deal fairly with consumers amid allegations of rip-off prices and poor service . ‘If customers are interested in this offer, our call agents ask whether they would like the additional number of the company that is offering the promotion. We’re keen to bring added value to our customers.’ The firm said its activities comply with the industry code of practice covering premium rate telephone lines, policed by watchdog PhonepayPlus. Ovo commercial director David Gooch said: ‘This is not the way to rebuild trust in an industry currently suffering from the lowest level of customer confidence in its history. ‘We urge customers to shop around for the best deals and not to fall for these sorts of aggressive marketing tactics which often results in signing up to a deal that is more expensive.’","Operator is required to highlight fixed energy tariff and highlight incentive .

"Five British siblings with a unique genetic condition affecting their joints have been told that their condition is so rare that it might be named after them. All five children in the Lambert family in south Yorkshire suffer from a disorder that predominately affects their bones and joints - a condition that has stumped doctors around the world. Their parents Cat and David Lambert, both 37, do not suffer from the disorder, but their children Bethany, 16, Leon, 14, Dawson, nine, Nyle, eight, and Miya, seven, all do. The Lambert children, from Rotherham South Yorkshire whose who all suffer the same condition which is so rare it might be named after them (Pictured: Bethany, 16, Leon, 14, Dawson, 9, Nyle, 8, and Miya, 7) The disease includes symptoms such as a twisted spine, improper bone growth and trouble growing muscle. Some of the children also have learning difficulties because of the condition - which affects all the children to different degrees of severity. And after half-a-decade of research doctors could now even name the condition - Lambert’s Syndrome. Cat said: 'Doctors from all over the world have been left puzzled by the condition affecting my children. The Lambert children with their father (left) David and their mother (right) Cat . 'DNA samples have been sent to experts at Cambridge and Oxford Universities. 'They have even sent DNA to experts in America, Canada, Finland and Sweden as part of ongoing research - but no known syndrome has been discovered yet.' Teaching assistant Cat added: 'It seems to affect all the joints in their bodies mainly. 'So they are either unusable - because they are so stiff - or so overly flexible that they dislocate constantly. 'Leon’s fingers used to dislocate around 50 times a day. 'He used to see it as some kind of party trick when he was younger, but it gets extremely painful for him after a while.'But then Dawson can’t even make a fist with his hand because his fingers are so stiff. 'I don’t think we’ll ever get to the bottom of what the syndrome is. 'We’ve had so many tests now and they’ve not been able to find a match against any known condition in the world over. 'Doctors have said it is extremely rare for a syndrome like ours to be discovered in this day-and-age. 'One consultant even said that they could name this condition after the family if future tests are inconclusive.' She added: 'It’s definitely a claim-to-fame, I suppose, but a claim we could live without.' The child most affected by the condition is Dawson and the brave youngster has had a constant string of operations since being born. Cat said: 'Dawson was born in June and had his first operation the following January on his pelvis. 'He even had bone cut of his hip and put into his feet to help him walk - almost like a skin graft with bone - to reconstruct his feet in four places. Despite the condition affecting every one of their children, parents David and Cat have said that they are able to lead a perfectly normal life . The condition predominantly affects the children's joints and bones, making them stiff and often painful . 'He had to be in a wheelchair for approximately nine months after that operation because he can’t grip crutches because the joints in his hand are so stiff and he has very little muscle growth.' Because the disorder also halts tendon growth (the connective tissue between muscle and bone), Dawson has to have an operation every month to stretch them. He will need these operations until he reaches the point when he stops growing. But despite this, the brave youngster - who could barely even manage one footstep after the surgery to reconstruct his feet - recently completed a 10-mile trek in aid of Sheffield Children’s Hospital in south Yorkshire, who performed the operation. As a result of the walk Dawson raised £612 for the cause. All of the children have suffered the syndrome their entire lives, which often takes the form of their muscles and tissue not growing properly, often requiring painful surgery to correct . He said: 'Walking is something people don’t really think about, but for me it’s been life changing. 'Every penny I make can help other people and go towards finding the next cure and improving someone else’s life. 'I’m getting on fine now, I can do lots more things and it feels excellent.' His mother said: 'At his worst, he couldn’t walk at all and needed a wheelchair. 'Without the physio he wouldn’t be able to get out of bed or go to school. The family are active members of their local church, and the eight-year-old son, Dawson, has recently undertaken a charity event where he undertook a 10-mile trek to raise money for the local children's hospital . 'We have to get up very early, especially when it’s cold and he needs to warm up at home first. 'Usually they would only operate on one foot at a time, but the condition means Dawson can’t use crutches. 'Once his pots were off he wanted to be walking everywhere straight away, but he had to learn how to do it all again. 'His walking is much better now. 'He has become more stable and can take more solid steps. At one point, he needed to wear a helmet because he was falling over all the time. The disorder affects muscle growth, but also often leads to learning difficulties in later life, as well as other problems like a lack of adult tooth growth . 'But he is brilliant with dealing with it all. He gives 110 per cent in everything.' Despite the condition affecting every one of her children, Cat describes the family as 'normal and happy'. The condition that all the children share is thought to be the only one of its kind, and is rare enough to the point that it might be named after them - although a member of the General Medical Council says this is also a rarity . Cat said: 'You are constantly being presented with new challenges in life and this one is ours. 'We just get on with things, though. We are happy, we are normal and we would not have things any other way.' Derek Burke, Medical Director, at Sheffield Children’s NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'We cannot comment on individual cases for reasons of patient confidentiality. However, it is important to note that it is no longer normal practice to name syndromes after doctors or families. 'At the Trust we host the Regional Clinical Genetics service. 'Our knowledge of rare genetic conditions, and testing available on a service basis, is improving all the time. 'However, where a diagnosis still remains unknown, we provide opportunities for families to take part in research studies that we hope will find the cause for their condition.'","All five children in the Lambert family have condition, but the parents don't .

"It was the emotional moment these soldiers had dreamed of for nine months in Afghanistan: to finally be dismissed so they could see their families.

But 25-year-old Kathryn could do nothing to contain her excitement. 'I was longing to hold him, that's all I thought about,' Ms Waldvogel told USA Today. 'It just melts my heart'. The troops who served with the National Guard's 114th Transportation Company had been ordered not to interact with family members as they stood in line. Video courtesy of KARE 11 .

"A school which asked students to compare Martin Luther King to convicted cop-killer Mumia Abu-Jamal in a lesson plan has been branded an 'absolute disgrace'. Maureen Faulkner, whose husband Daniel was shot by Abu-Jamal in 1981, blasted the taxpayer-funded plan, saying it advocated violence. The lesson, given to students in Oakland, California, asked them to draw a 'possible parallel' between civil rights activist King, and 'someone else many believe is currently targeted by the U.S. government, Mumia Abu-Jamal.' Students were asked to compare Mumia Abu-Jamal (left), who was convicted of killing a policeman in 1981, and Martin Luther King Jr. who had a policy of strict non-violence . Speaking to Fox News, Maureen said: 'It’s a travesty. You’re going to teach children about a man who murdered a police officer? 'That’s not a good lesson to be teaching children. He was a radical, a militant.' The plan, written by teacher Craig Gordon and designed for 11h grade students, also asks them to consider the following statement: 'The media, prison system and law enforcement organizations have censored Mumia Abu-Jamal. 'On one hand, there have been occasional stories in print and broadcast media about Mumia Abu-Jamal. 'On the other, despite the widespread support for Abu-Jamal that has made his case the most renown and controversial of death penalty cases in the world today, these stories are extremely rare and always refer to him as a ""convicted cop-killer.""' The plan was posted on the Oakland . Unified School District’s website. Troy Flint, spokesman for the . district, said the lesson plan is no longer part of the curriculum. 'The . fact that a website documenting Urban Dreams remains accessible is an . oversight related to technology management; it does not speak to current . instructional practice in OUSD,' Flint told Fox News in an e-mail. Daniel Faulker was killed during an early-morning traffic stop in Philadelphia in 1981 . 'To avoid any confusion in the future, we will conduct an inventory of the numerous websites created to support learning districtwide to ensure they conform with our present academic philosophy and do not inadvertently misrepresent Oakland schools.' Mumia Abu-Jamal was convicted of Daniel Faulkner's murder after his brother got into a scuffle with the policeman during a 4am traffic stop in Philadelphia. Faulkner was shot several times and died at the scene, Abu-Jamal was later found with a bullet wound from Faulker's gun, and a .38 calibre handgun registered to Abu-Jamal was found at the scene. It took a Pennsylvania jury just thre hours to find him guilty and he was sentenced to death. However, over the years Abu-Jamal challenged the predominantly white makeup of the jury, the instructions given to the jurors and the accounts of eyewitnesses. Abu-Jamal had his sentence reduced to life in jail in 2011 after three decades of campaigning by supporters . He also said that his lawyer was ineffective, that the judge was racist and that another man confessed to the crime. The one-time journalist's own 1995 book, 'Live From Death Row,' depicts prison life and calls the justice system racist. He got worldwide support from the 'Free Mumia' movement, with hundreds of vocal supporters and death-penalty opponents regularly turning out for court hearings in his case. In 2011 the sentence was downgraded to life imprisonment after Maureen Faulker agreed to the decision. The niece of Martin Luther King, Alevda, said she was not familiar with Abu-Jamal's case, but that anybody seking to understand her uncle should start with his policy of non-violence.","School lesson plan published online asked students to compare the two .

"A New York City special education teacher has avoided jail time after admitting she had sex with a 15-year-old boy at least four times in her car outside school. A Brooklyn Supreme Court judge gave Evelyn Rogers, 34, ten years of probation after she pleaded guilty to statutory rape - despite the protests of prosecutors who argued that she deserved jail time. Rogers taught special education at High School for Innovation in Advertising and Media in the Canarsie neighborhood of Brooklyn. Guilty: Teacher Evelyn Rogers, 33, admitted to having sex with a 15-year-old boy at least four times in her car . Authorities would not say whether her 15-year-old victim was a student at the school or a student of hers, the New York Daily News reports. She admitted to investigators that she had sex with the boy at least four times - all in her car. The encounters took place between August and September 2012. The Special Commissioner of Investigation questioned Rogers and her victim last year after getting a tip about the illicit relationship. Rogers faced a maximum of 16 years in prison - four years for each count - but the Judge Elizabeth Foley went for leniency and opted not to put her behind bars. Rogers was a special education teacher at High School for Innovation in Advertising and Media in Canarsie, Brooklyn, New York . Prosecutors objected and said Rogers deserved at least some time. Her plea deal called for up to three years in prison. Judge Foley cited a previous case - so-called 'horndog high' teacher Erin Sayar - who received probation for a similar charge. Prosecutors argued that in that case, Sayar was granted leniency because she was fighting cancer at the time. Rogers must forfeit her teaching license and will have to register as a sex offender.","Evelyn Rogers pleaded guilty to statutory rape .

"Two brothers have become the first British children to be fitted with the ‘injectable’ heart rate monitors, using smartphone technology to transmit information about their heartbeat to doctors. Eight-year-old Ethan Roper and Kyle, seven, were each implanted with a tiny device called a Reveal Linq Insertable Cardiac Monitor  on Valentine’s Day. The miniature heart rate monitors record the rhythm of their heart 24 hours a day. Success: Kyle and Ethan Roper from Doncaster, the first to have a procedure in the UK to implant a new type of monitor as they are suspected to have heart conditions . In a procedure which took just minutes, under general anaesthetic, their surgeon made a shallow 5mm incision in each boy’s chest, above the heart. The devices were inserted just under the skin using a specially designed plunger. The technique used is similar to the microchipping of horses and dogs, and the resulting wound is so small it can be glued afterwards, rather than stitched. The hope is that the device will  be a boon for the millions of Britons who suffer difficult-to-diagnose, life-threatening heart rate disturbances, known as arrhythmia. Doctors at Leeds General Infirmary decided to fit the brothers with the device to determine whether they have inherited a potentially fatal heart condition from their mother. The state-of-the-art titanium devices, which cost £1,500 each and have a battery life of three years, look like a computer memory stick and are the size of two matchsticks. Two tiny electrodes within them pick up the electrical pattern of the heart rate and detect any irregularities in the same method as a standard ECG. Heart Monitor . Data is sent wirelessly to portable base stations in the boys’ home in Doncaster. It uses a 3G signal to automatically pass that data on  to medical professionals in hospital who analyse the information for abnormalities every day. Each brother has his own base station. As soon as the boys come within three metres, the base station will download that day’s data so there is no need for them to take the machine to school. They will only have to take the base stations along if they go on holiday or spend long periods away from home. ‘In the past we would have missed symptoms which these devices will now be able to pick up,’ says consultant cardiologist Dr Mike Blackburn, who fitted the devices. ‘We used to rely on cumbersome portable echocardiograms [ECG],  a scanning device that allows us to monitor heart rate for the time that it is attached to the patient. They are about the size of an iPod and come with wires which are taped to the chest and can monitor the heart for a few hours to a week. ‘But the chances of picking up something while the ECG was on was always slim, due to the unpredictable nature of symptoms. We tried this option with both boys but unsurprisingly they offered no conclusive results.’ Early precursors to the injectable monitor have been in use since the late 1990s. Like the Reveal Linq, they were fitted under the skin but didn’t monitor information automatically, working only if the patient set it to record after an episode. The devices were about seven times the size and had no way of wirelessly transmitting data. ‘We used them in children but they were quite unsightly and much more painful to fit and we used them much less as a result, although we probably would have had to use them in this case,’ says Dr Blackburn. Doctors had already determined that Ethan has inherited Long QT syndrome from his mother. This is a rare heart condition that can cause fainting and arrhythmia, and if untreated, can be fatal. A standard ECG identified Ethan’s condition. But doctors wanted to find out whether this was also the case for Kyle, whose ECG results were inconclusive but who recently collapsed at home. They also wanted to find out whether the medication Ethan was being given was adequate. ‘The difficulty with treatment for this sort of condition is that we only know it’s working when nothing happens,’ says Dr Blackburn. ‘If something does happen, like a collapse, then it can be difficult to determine the cause without having captured it on an ECG. Installing these heart rate monitors means we are guaranteed to pick it up the next time one of the boys has a problem.’ The name ‘Long QT’ refers to an abnormally long gap between the Q and T waves as measured by an ECG, meaning it takes longer for the heart cells in the ventricles to recharge after each heartbeat. Children with a parent who has  the condition have a 50 per cent of chance of inheriting it themselves. Patients tend to be prescribed beta-blockers, which help to slow down and stabilise the heart rhythm. If this is unsuccessful, a defibrillator can be fitted which delivers an electric shock to the heart if it stops. ‘Fitting a defibrillator is a big step for young patients, which is why it’s so important to be certain they actually need one,’ says Dr Blackburn. The boys’ mother Zoe, 34, who is successfully managing her condition with beta-blockers, says fitting them with heart rate monitors came as a great relief. ‘It puts my mind at rest to know they are going to be monitored 24/7,’ says the stay-at-home mum. ‘It’s reassuring to know the doctors  will be alerted straight away to  any abnormalities.’ Zoe was only diagnosed with Long QT syndrome herself last May when she was sent for an ECG after going to see her GP about what she thought was heartburn. ‘They told me my children had a 50/50 chance of inheriting it, which was a shock and really hard to come to terms with. They are very outgoing, cheeky boys. They’re active and live normal lives. They love basketball and their scooters, they never stop. But I’m very protective of them now and like to have them with me all the time. When they’re at school, I’m terrified of getting a call to say one of them has collapsed. ‘I wasn’t worried at all about the surgery as I knew they were in safe hands and Dr Blackburn had reassured me it’s a very safe procedure. ‘The boys came home the same evening and were bouncing around and  back to their normal selves within the hour,’ she adds.","Ethan and Kyle Roper have been fitted with a heart rate monitor .

"The ship that led Christopher Columbus' mission to discover America has been found after 500 years, it has been claimed. A recent expedition has left experts 'confident' a wreck found off the north coast of Haiti is the the Santa Maria. The 58foot ship was the flagship of the expectation, but its final whereabouts have never been known - until now. Christopher Columbus on Santa Maria in 1492, in a paiting by Emanuel Leutze from 1855. Experts now believe they have discovered the wreck of the ship off the coast of Haiti. The Santa María was belived to be a 58 ft (17.7 m) long boat, described as 'very little larger than 100 toneladas' (About 100 tons, or tuns). It was used as the flagship for the expedition, along with the smaller ships Santa Clara, remembered as La Niña ('The Girl'), and La Pinta ('The Painted'). All three of the ships were second-hand (if not third or more) and were not intended for exploration. The wreck was found off the north coast . of Haiti during an expedition led by Barry Clifford, an explorer most . famously known for his discovery of a complete pirate ship. 'All the geographical, underwater topography and archaeological evidence strongly suggest that this wreck is Columbus famous flagship, the Santa Maria,' said Clifford, who led a recent expedition to the wreck as part of a History Channel TV show. 'The Haitian government has been extremely helpful and we now need to continue working with them to carry out a detailed archaeological excavation', he told the Independent. Clifford has spent over a decade tracing the origins of the wreck. During The first voyage of Columbus in 1492, near Hispaniola, Columbus' flagship, the Santa María ran aground, and the waves smashed it to pieces. Leaving several men behind to establish a fort, Columbus set sail for Spain in the Niña. The route of the first voyage - and the final resting place of the Santa Maria . The discovery has been backed up by 2003 researcher that pinpointed the probable location of Columbus's fort nearby. An expedition a decade ago led by Clifford had photographed the wreck - but had no idea the boat was the Santa Maria. However, the team has already found items - including a cannon, have been looted, and is working with the Haitian government 'to ensure the site is protected and preserved. 'I am confident that a full excavation of the wreck will yield the first ever detailed marine archaeological evidence of Coumbus's discovery of America, said Clifford. 'If excavations go well, it may ultimately be possible to lift any surviving remains of the vessel, fully conserve them and put them on display in a museum in Haiti. In 1492, King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, the rulers of the Spanish kingdoms of Castile and Aragon, agreed to outfit three ships for Columbus, also promising to make him governor of any new lands he might acquire, along with 10 percent of all the wealth that he would bring to Spain. With his fleet of three ships Columbus sailed west on August 3, 1492 with 90 crew, first stopping  at the Canary Islands to make repairs and take aboard fresh food. Then the fleet headed out into the open Atlantic, dubbed the Sea of Darkness . On the 70th day (many days after Columbus had already expected to reach Japan), a lookout sighted land. It was early on the morning of October 12, 1492. They landed on one of the islands of the Bahamas, which Columbus named San Salvador. The island natives came down to the shore to see Columbus' strange ships. Thinking he had reached the East Indies, Columbus called these people Indians. Columbus had discovered what Europeans would soon call the New World of the Americas. Santa María ship model displayed in Fort San Cristóbal, San Juan, Puerto Rico . The voyage sailed on to Asia. He spent the next ten weeks exploring the islands of the Caribbean, landing on the island of Hispaniola, shared today by the Dominican Republic and Haiti. He also landed on Cuba, which he thought was the Asian mainland. Both islands were heavily populated. Near Hispaniola, Columbus' flagship, the Santa María, ran aground. The waves smashed it to pieces. Leaving several men behind to establish a fort, Columbus set sail for Spain in the Niña. On the voyage home, he wrote a report of his discoveries. He offered  'as much gold as they need…and as many slaves as they ask'  if King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella would finance another voyage. As proof of what he could do, he brought them back a small amount of gold, parrots, and plants - as well as some Indians he had kidnapped and enslaved. Previous researcher has found the daring seafarers who went on Christopher Columbus’ second trip to the New World in 1493 had major obstacles to overcome in their journey. Not only were they stepping into the unknown to find a home, but a new study suggests they may have also suffered from scurvy while sailing across the Atlantic. The scurvy killed many of the early colonisers, researchers claim, causing the ultimate demise of the La Isabela settlement within just four years of it being founded. This is according to historic documents and analysis of 27 skeletons buried at Columbus' settlement in what is now the Dominican Republic. Researchers believe the colonisers beat most of the scurvy by the time they died, but the disease may have contributed to a wave of deaths in the early colony. La Isabela, the first permanent European town in the Western Hemisphere, was abandoned within just four years of being established amid sickness and deprivation. Bones of sailors and colonists from graves behind the abandoned village's small churchyard have been unearthed from the site since the 1980s. La Isabela was established in what is now the Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic. It was one of the first European settlements in America. It was founded by Christopher Columbus during his second voyage in 1493 and named after Queen Isabella I of Castile. Historic documents and analysis of 27 skeletons buried at Columbus' settlement in what is now the Dominican Republic suggests the early colonisers suffered from severe scurvy . Hunger and disease is thought to have soon led to mutiny, punishment, disillusion, and more hunger and disease. A group of settlers, led by Bernal de Pisa, attempted to capture and make off with several ships and go back to Spain. La Isabela's demise took place in 1496 when Columbus decided to abandon it in favour of a new settlement, which is now known as Santo Domingo. ‘They were still encased in earth when we started the study. We had to clean the bones to proceed,’ study author Vera Tiesler told National Geographic. Historians have blamed smallpox, influenza, and malaria for the town's failure, but the latest study by Mexico's Universidad Autonoma de Yucatán argues scurvy was the main cause. At least 20 of the 27 skeletons had signs—ridges carved in the outer lining of bones—of what the study describes as 'severe scurvy.' Scurvy, caused by one to three months of vitamin C deficiency, plagued seafarers until the 18th century. Symptoms included lethargy, anaemia, and, the re-opening of old wounds. Researchers suggest the voyagers might have avoided scurvy if they'd sailed directly from Spain to La Isabela - a journey of two months or less. When Columbus and his companions reached the Americas, they landed at a Hispaniola outpost first. ‘It was especially long, this trip - three months. And that's exactly the time scurvy needs to be in full bloom,’ Professor Tiesler said.","Researchers 'confident' excavation will prove the ship's identity .

"Australian of the Year Adam Goodes has attracted criticism for saying Australian history is built on lies. During a recent interview with the BBC, the AFL star said some Australian policies had resulted in the suppression of indigenous people and other minorities and called for better education about the country's history. 'The history of our country is built on so much lies and racial policies, and things that have suppressed my people and lots of minorities in this country, so you can't blame people for having the views that they have,' he said. He also said children needed to be taught that Australia wasn't founded by Captain James Cook. Scroll down for video . Adam Goodes, pictured right playing for the Swans, was awarded Australian of the Year for 2014 . 'I can use my position to help educate people to see through the things that they've been taught growing up,' he said. 'Open their minds (and realise) 'That's not true: Captain Cook didn't found Australia' as I was taught in high school.' Talkback radio host Neil Mitchell criticised Goodes for trying to 'change the country'. 'The sooner Adam Goodes finishes as Australian of the Year the better, as far as I'm concerned,' he said. 'At times Adam Goodes seems not to like Australia.' Goodes wants school kids to learn that Australia was not founded by Captain Cook . One Twitter user called Goodes 'by far the worst (Australian of the year) we've ever had' while another called him 'wanker of the year'. But there was also support for the Sydney Swans star, with Twitter users saying 'Neil Mitchells pathetic response to Adam Goodes just proves Adam is correct in what he is saying,' and 'I support @adamroy37 as Australian of The Year. Disappointing that @3AWNeilMitchell made such inflammatory & inaccurate comments this morning'. Goodes stepped up his work as an anti-racism campaigner last year after being subjected to abuse by a 13-year-old girl during a Sydney Swans game, and later became the subject of a joke made by Collingwood President Eddie McGuire in relation to King Kong the musical. Goodes has been the target of a string of racial attacks in the past two years.

"If there is one thing I'm A Celebrity viewers have noticed this series it's that Melanie Sykes body really is a sight to behold. So fabulously toned is the 44-year-old mother-of-two that her rock hard six pack has been the talk of the show in and outside the camp. In an interview prior to her move to the jungle, Mel revealed her body isn't thanks to a get fit quick plan after signing up for the show. Scroll down for video . Ab fab: Melanie shows off her defined abs in a black bra in the I'm A Celebrity Jungle which her trainer reveals are down to a variety of exercises . We'd all be laughing if we had abs like Mel's, seen here in the jungle as she jokes with her campmates . Doing a Myleene: Mel couldn't resist a turn under the infamous jungle shower wearing two different bikinis to show off her body . 'I've been training for seven years so I'm always bikini ready,' she said. Mel's trainer Chris Constantinou revealed that the secret to having a body like hers is you have to do a variety of exercises as well as sticking to a healthy diet. He said: 'All too often people make the mistake of doing 100’s of crunches morning and night in the hope this will unearth the abs of Peter Andre in the 1990’s.' Chris recommends a mixture of five different exercises. Starting with jumping sumo squats: 'These are similar to traditional jumping squats but with feet at a 45 degree angle to really work the inner thighs and gluts,' he explained. Next try an 'own body weight push up with shoulder touch.' Chris said. 'This is a challenging twist to a push up, once at the top touch your shoulder with the opposing arm, giving a ""Down, Up, Touch, Touch"" rhythm.' The third exercise that he recommends is jumping lunges: 'This will get your heart rate up as well and working the gluts and quads.' Prepared for the jungle: Mel claims that she has been bikini ready for seven whole years . Proud: Before heading into the jungle Mel posted bikini pictures to her Twitter account showing off her body . Getting glammed up: Melanie has her hair done by her close friend celebrity hair and make-up stylist Gary Cockerill in another Twitter snap . Next he recommends core stability move 'the plank'. 'Switch your weight between your forearms and the palms of the hands for the duration of the hold, this engages a greater number of the abdominals than a static plank,' he said. The final - and possibly most difficult exercise - that Chris recommends is burpees. 'Begin in a standing position. Feet shoulder-width apart, he explains. 'Lower your body into a squatting position, place hands on the floor in front of you. Kick feet back to be in a push-up position. 'Lower chest to do a push-up. Bring chest back up. Kicking feet back to their original squat position. Stand up, and then jump into the air while reaching arms overhead. Repeat.' But while these exercises will help you burn calories and become fitter and stronger, Chris said it's not the only thing that will give you a body like Mel's. He said: 'Remember, diet is as important as exercise. Avoid sugar dense food and drinks as this is known to sit on your midriff, it important to chose wisely post exercise to rehydrate and recover.' He recommends drinks high in protein after exercise to help your muscles recover such as milk or his favourite, CocoPro, a high protein coconut water drink. Before heading into the jungle Mel revealed to OK! Magazine that she has been happy with her body for some time. However she did voice her concerns that she would lose weight thanks to the meagre jungle portions. 'I'm going to lose weight and I don't want to - I like being athletic and fit, I don't like being slim. Eating just rice and beans, that's going to drive me mad,' she said.","Mel has been 'bikini ready' for seven years thanks to working out .

"As Britain braces itself for  downpours this winter, one council has come up with an ingenious solution to reducing the risk to homes from flooding - building them on stilts. Houses in a Suffolk town are to be built on poles measuring three metres high, in a Dutch-inspired scheme to keep them safe away from flood waters. It is thought to be the first time the scheme will be used in the UK. An image of the houses on stilts that are to built in Suffolk to keep people's homes away from flood waters . Assael Architecture, which has designed the complex, has produced images of what the marina will look like . The homes, which are part of a £150 million housing scheme, were designed by London firm Assael Architecture for the Suffolk peninsula, where flooding is a particular concern. Polly Damen, 45, director of Assael, said: 'We designed these innovative houses on stilts so they could survive in an obvious flood zone. 'The whole scheme was inspired by Dutch solution to flooding - I don't think this has been tried yet in England.' The scheme at Lake Lothing in Lowestoft was given planning approval by Waveney District Council last week. The homes are to be built on stilts on the flood plain and are inspired by a Dutch design to cope with flooding . The scheme will be built around Lake Lothing in Suffolk to avoid houses on the flood plain being flooded . Mrs Damen said the designs had been welcomed by the council and public and they were keen to seem more similar homes built in the area. 'They're essentially flat-pack buildings which can be put up quickly and can cope with any kind of flood - they can be raised as high as you'd like quite easily,' she added. Experts predict the sea level in Suffolk will rise 37cm by the year 2080, making coastal flooding more likely. Earlier this year vast areas of the Somerset Levels were left underwater by torrential rain and floods . In February cars  were left floating in flood waters near  Somerset during the wettest ever winter for the UK . Council planners will be hoping to avoid what happened in Somerset last winter when vast swathes of the south west were left submerged when the country was battered by torrential rain. Villages in the Somerset Levels were completely cut off by the flood waters, and the Environment Agency was forced to bring in dredgers and pumps to remove some of the excess water. The Met Office said last winter was the wettest on record. Two weeks' worth of rainfall are expected to hit the UK on Tuesday night as Hurricane Gonzalo hits the country.","Inspired by Dutch scheme, houses on flood plain will be built on stilts .

After that incident he tweeted: 'I'm sad for what happened this afternoon, I apologize Ivanovic and all football world for my inexcusable behaviour. I'm so sorry about it!!'

At 43, Mel looks incredible . Out and about: Mel look great  in London last week, looking chic and summery . Mel's first marriage was to actor Daniel Caltagirone, who is the father of their children, Roman, 12, and Valentino, 10. They divorced in 2009 and three years later, Melanie and Jack started exchanging tweets. The pair raised eyebrows with their sexually charged and very public messages over Twitter. Exclusive: Melanie Sykes looking fit and fabulous . Their relationship moved at lightening speed, with Mel and Jack marrying in May 2013. But the relationship came to an end almost as quickly as it had started. The pair split up in December 2013, after just seven months of marriage. Mel also opens up to Fabulous about her youngest son Valentino - Tino - who was diagnosed with autism at the age of two. ‘I had to get some focus and learn how to be strong and happy in order to help him,' she says. 'Tino has no grey areas and is very straight talking, and I like that about him. I’ve 100 per cent learned from him.’ On being too old for TV, Mel says: ‘If women feel that they’ve been dismissed unfairly then that’s their battle to be had. 'I personally don’t want to be on television when I’m in my 60s anyway. I’d rather have a great radio show and swan about having a fabulous life, thank you very much.’ Melanie kicked off her television career on The Big Breakfast, going on to host Today with Des and Mel, with Des O'Connor in 2003, Let's Do Lunch with Gino and Mel in 2011 and, most recently, was a presenter on BT Sport’s Moto GP, though left abruptly after only a few shows.

"These stunning photographs are not just colourful depictions of city life - they are also part of a visionary attempt to capture the passage of time in still images. Artist Fong Qi Wei was keen to invent a way to show how scenes change over time, without resorting to a video camera or time-lapse photography. So he captured multiple pictures of the same sites over the course of a day, before splicing them together into a single image taken over several hours. The series is entitled 'Time is a . Dimension', and aims to prove that skilled photography can show the . passage of time just as easily as a video. Innovative: These photographs show cityscapes pictured over the course of several hours and then spliced together to show the passage of time . Glow: The pictures were taken at sunrise and sunset, and mostly focus on a point of maximum light or maximum darkness . Surreal: The photographs are an innovative attempt to show the passage of time - the 'fourth dimension' - using just the two dimensions of photography . Mr Fong was inspired by the way that photographs can summon up a three-dimensional scene even though they only have two dimensions themselves. So he started to think about how it would be possible to display time - sometimes called 'the fourth dimension' - using only a static 2D picture. 'Most paintings and photographs are an instance of time,' he said. 'That's not the way the world works. We experience a sequence of time, and that's why a video is somehow more compelling than a freeze frame. 'I work in the confines of a photographic print, because I like to do so. But in a way, I wanted to break out of this restriction of a single slice of time in photography.' Vivid: Landscapes around Singapore which could be considered monotonous become glowingly colourful thanks to Fong Qi Wei's techniques . Dazzling: Mr Fong's methods allow him to capture all the different phases of a sunrise or sunset in a single image . Lush: Some of the images capture more pastoral scenes bathed in a variety of coloured lights . Mr Fong, who works in Singapore, said he regards video as an unsatisfactory replacement for photography, because it requires an electrically powered device to operate. The solution he hit upon involved taking a number of photos over a two- to four-hour period, usually during sunrise or sunset to get the greatest possible contrast in light within a single image. He then uses digital technology to cut the individual photographs together, creating composite images which usually centre on the point of maximum light or maximum darkness. Standalone: Mr Fong is able to show the passage of time without relying on electrically powered video equipment or blurry timelapse . Through the blinds: Mr Gong creates slats of colour distributed across the face of his images . Seashore: Mr Fong's images are particularly striking when they capture the sun moving across the face of the water . The basic structure of a landscape is present in every piece,' Mr Fong said. 'But each panel or concentric layer shows a different slice of time, which is related to the adjacent panel/layer. 'The transition from daytime to night is gradual and noticeable in every piece, but would not be something you expect to see in a still image. 'Similarly, our experience of a scene is more than a snapshot. We often remember a sequence of events rather than a still frame full of details.'",Fong Qi Wei aims to show the passage of time in a still image by cutting together multiple photographs .
"She's outselling J.K Rowling and has penned the fastest selling debut since 50 Shades of Grey but just a year ago, Jessie Burton was struggling to make ends meet. A would-be actress moonlighting as a PA to get by, the 31-year-old Londoner spent her evenings writing and re-writing the novel that would become this summer's biggest selling debut, The Minaturist. No-one is more surprised by her success than Burton, who says the last few months been 'a dream' while describing The Miniaturist's popularity as 'totally unexpected'. Selling well: Jessie Burton's debut novel The Minaturist is currently outselling E.L James and J.K Rowling . Bestseller: Jessie's book, The Miniaturist, is currently number two in the book charts . 'I didn't expect anything beyond it being . published,' says Burton, modestly. 'That had always been the dream. 'Then for it to become a bestseller... I hadn't . even thought about it. I had learned to manage my expectations, so all . this is completely wonderful.' With The Miniaturist currently sitting second in the book charts, life for Burton now consists of writing hard and flitting from interview to party. It's all a far cry from her previous life as a struggling actress and sometime PA. 'The phone wasn't ringing much for acting . auditions,' she admits. 'I had fallen a little out of love with the game of it and it made me feel powerless in my own life.' With her days taken up by admin and auditions, Burton used her evenings to sketch out the draft of the book that would become The Minaturist, a 17th century yarn set in Amsterdam that revolves around a tiny dolls' house given to the heroine by her husband. 'Writing was a private expression of . creativity when I was working in offices as a PA,' adds Burton. 'I had hoped to one day to . catch the attention of a literary agent but it would have been crazy . just to announce ""I'm going to a writer now"" because it's as unreliable . as acting!' Instead, she kept plugging away and, after four years of drafting version after version, finally had a manuscript to send out. Surprisingly in light of the book's enormous success, Burton at first met with rejection. 'I had polite rejections from literary agents and was . sometimes just met with a wall of silence,' she explains. 'But all you need is one . gesture of encouragement to carry on. I couldn't do much else with . myself other than act and write, so I just carried on.' Succour came in the shape of literary agent Juliet Mushens, who took her on after reading the first three chapters of The Miniaturist. Inspiration: Jessie's debut novel was inspired by her travels in Amsterdam and is set in a 17th century version . From there, things began to snowball with Mushens securing a six-figure publishing deal with Picador following an intense bidding war. Burton, you can't help but sense, is still happily reeling at her unexpected success. Nevertheless, she says she won't be resting on her laurels and is already hard at work on another book. 'It's called Belonging,' she reveals of novel number two. 'It's about an . artist who is disgraced and disappears during the Spanish Civil War. '30 years on, a woman with a secret finds her life thrown into turmoil when . his missing works turn up in her London gallery. It's about art and . identity, war, and finding love and friendship in unorthodox places.' But with a tour of the U.S planned for September and requests for appearances and signings flooding in, it might be a while before readers can get their hands on it. In the meantime, Burton is off on a well-earned holiday with boyfriend Pip Carter and says she'll be catching up on a reading list of her own. Heroes: Jessie says Hilary Mantel (left) is one of her heroes, as is Harry Potter author J.K Rowling (right) Busy: Jessie's next stop is a tour of the U.S, after which she will go back to writing her second novel . 'My all time favourites are Jane Eyre, The . Blind Assassin, The Handmaid's Tale, Mansfield Park, Moon Tiger, The . Sea and Wolf Hall,' declares the avid reader, mischievously adding: 'But that's just today!' She credits her love of reading with her . writing success but says she still has some way to go before becoming comfortable with the idea of being favourably compared to another of her . favourite writers - Harry Potter author J.K Rowling. 'I think I've a long, long way to go before I can even consider that compliment,' she laughs, gracefully brushing off the comparison. 'She's one of my heroes.' Despite her protests, it remains an apt comparison. Like Rowling, she has enjoyed tremendous success with her debut novel and, like the Scottish author, has seen her life transformed. 'It's funny really,' she adds. 'I feel like the same . person but, yet, with more freedom and more responsibilities. 'Life has . opened up a bit. Obviously the nod of acknowledgment from the . publishing world has made a huge difference to my self-esteem. 'I . knew I could create things, I just needed someone to give me that . chance. But on a day to day basis, I hope my friends would say I'm . exactly the same as I ever was.' Jessie Burton's debut novel The Miniaturist is published by Picador and costs £12.99 . Publishing star: Literary agent Juliet Mushens, 27, knows a thing or two about getting books published . Like her client Jessie Burton, Juliet Mushens is one of the literary world's up-and-coming stars, albeit on the publishing side. A literary agent working for the Agency Group, Mushens is the woman behind Burton's six-figure deal and knows better than anyone what it takes to pen a best seller. Here, she reveals how to hit the big time with books: . PLAN YOUR NOVEL . 'Decide on your genre, world and characters before you start writing. Many novelists run out of steam in a few chapters because the story won't sustain them over more than a few thousand words. Carry a notebook around with you and start paying attention to interesting stories, bits of conversation, or paintings: anything which sparks your imagination. Be on the lookout for the fascinating and the absurd. Some ideas won't be sustainable but some will be fertile ground for the imagination. KNOW YOUR STORY . A lot of novels I get sent meander along. Know what your plot is and the journey which your characters are going on. You should know what the stakes are and why the reader will care about them. Build in suspense, keep the reader guessing. I know when I have something special on my desk when it stops feeling like work – I remember reading the full manuscript of The Fire Sermon by Francesca Haig when she submitted it and I printed it out to carry on reading it on the tube. It was no surprise to me when it went on to sell to 24 countries, with Dreamworks making the film. BECOME A READER . The best writers are big readers. Look at novels which sell and those which don't, join a book group, browse bookshops and become comfortable with genre. I see a lot of submissions which say 'I have written a [insert genre here] novel but I have never read [insert genre here]'. You are shooting yourself in the foot. Learn what works from other writers, what the tropes are and how to subvert them, and your own work will become stronger. DON'T WRITE TO TRENDSPeople often get hung up on the bestseller lists but those books will have been commissioned 12-18 months earlier so you are already writing to something that is out of date. The best books can define trends or set new ones. RESEARCH THE INDUSTRY . Is self-publishing right for you? Consider how to market and sell your work and if you expect to be able to reach a wide audience through Kindle sales. If you want to be traditionally published you need to find a literary agent. Find out which agencies accept submissions and how to send them your work - there's no point sending your Sci-Fi novel to someone who handles romance. Put the effort into submitting your novel that you would into applying for a job: proofread, edit, check, double-check. Submit the strongest work you can. Gone are the days when agents were faceless entities: now you can meet them at writing festivals or connect with them on Twitter. LEARN FROM REJECTION . Writing is a long process and the road to success is littered with rejection. Some of my bestselling authors had years of rejections before I signed them: Mary Chamberlain's novel, The Dressmaker of Dachau, will publish next year in 14 languages and she is in her 60s. Jessie Burton had a novel before The Miniaturist which no agent signed. No one likes rejection but if you love writing, keep persevering and figure out why this book hasn’t been a success. As an agent I get hundreds of rejections from publishers, but it just makes me want to work harder to find the right book. KEEP TRYING . I'm always on the lookout for the next big thing. My entire client list came from unsolicited submissions and I am passionate about finding new voices. None of my authors got signed for their first book, and in some cases, the book I signed them for originally wasn't the one that sold to a publisher. Every writer has a rejection folder but you learn from everything you write and you will improve with every book. LOVE WHAT YOU DO . If you go into publishing with the belief you're going to make lots of money, you are liable to be disappointed. Some of my authors do make six or even seven figures from their writing, but the vast majority work a day job too. What needs to keep you going is your passion for writing. One of my authors told me that even if her next book didn't sell she would still carry on writing - writing brought her so much joy that the deal was just the cherry on the cake. I only sign books which I feel passionately about. I work hard for my authors because I want them to succeed and nothing beats the moment you call someone in the middle of their working day and say ""Are you sitting down? I have some wonderful news.""","Jessie Burton, 31, is the author of summer bestseller, The Miniaturist .

"When Emma Witty died of a brain haemorrhage at 19, her family were determined that some good should come of the tragedy. A year on, they have spoken of their pride after her organs helped to save six lives. Miss Witty, a budding photographer who loved giving to charity, collapsed at her home in Leeds in June last year. Her devastated family decided to allow her organs to be donated to patients in need of a transplant. Emma Witty died aged 19 from a brain haemorrhage, but her organs have helped save the lives of six people . Miss Witty's mother Catherine Gregson said the thought that her daughter had helped saved so many lives gave her 'a lot of comfort' Miss Witty’s heart was given to a young woman in her 20s. A man in his 50s received her pancreas and one of her kidneys, while her lungs and other kidney went to male patients in their 60s. Her liver benefited two patients, a man and a baby girl of one. Her corneas were also thought to be donated. Miss Witty’s mother Catherine Gregson said: ‘While it is difficult, it does give me a lot of comfort to know she has helped save so many lives and that her eyes are out there still seeing and her heart is somewhere still beating.’ Mrs Gregson described the horror of discovering her daughter had suffered a brain haemorrhage. ‘I was staying at my mum’s as she had been poorly,’ she said. ‘I kept phoning Emma as she told me she was going to be at home.’ At 2am, Mrs Gregson received a call saying her daughter was in hospital. ‘She came round and we all thought that she was going to be fine. She started to talk, although she was very confused.’ But within days Miss Witty’s condition started to deteriorate. She died on June 20. Her boyfriend Oli Dobson said: ‘After she died I was at the hospital with Emma’s mum and dad, and the doctor asked if we thought Emma would want to donate her organs. Her mum and dad looked at me and asked what I thought. I said of course she would. ‘She would want to do what she could to help others. That’s the type of person she was.’","Emma Witty's parents allowed their daughter's organs to be donated .

"A crazed gunman who terrorized three people during a standoff at a rural Louisiana bank posted terrifying Facebook messages including a cartoon about hostages in the hours leading up to his deadly assault. The standoff ended after 12 hours on Tuesday with one male hostage shot dead by suspect . Fuaed Abdo Ahmed and another LaDean McDaniel being left in critically injured. In the hours leading up to the deadly attack, it was discovered that Ahmed had posted a photo of a man with a sword battling a tank online. Scroll down for video . Attack: Hostage-taker Fuaed Abdo Ahmed shot dead a bank employee and critically injured another in St Joseph, Louisiana on Tuesday. He was killed by a SWAT team who stormed the building . Disturbed: Ahmed posted this image on his Facebook in the hours leading up to the hostage situation at a Louisiana bank. He was killed along with one hostage . On August 11, he posted a cartoon strip on his Facebook wall which shows a hostage negotiation. In the first image, a man in a balaclava pointing a gun at a man says: 'I'll release the hostage if you give me a sandwich!' Two . hostage negotiators are then seen discussing the demand. The first . says: 'How close is the nearest deli' to which the other responds: . 'Three blocks.' In the last picture, a hostage negotiator says through a bullhorn: 'Okay, you can kill the hostage.' The 20-year-old had initially taken three hostages when he stormed the . Tensas State Bank in St Joseph before releasing the woman. Louisiana . State Police superintendent Col. Mike Edmonson said he had no further . information about the dead hostage. Preparing for what comes: State and local authorities gathered outside the Tensas State Bank branch after an armed 20-year-old man took three people hostage Tuesday afternoon . Scene: The incident is believed to have started as a robbery attempt that escalated into a hostage situation . During . negotiations with law enforcement Ahmed said he was going to kill the . remaining two, and when officers entered the building just before . midnight on Tuesday he shot the hostages before being shot and killed by . police. Edmonson said Ahmed shot the two hostages in the upper body before state police shot and killed him. He said the hostages were taken from the scene in critical condition after the incident, which began when the gunman took two women and a man captive about 12:30 pm yesterday. Hours after the standoff began, one of . the hostages was released but their condition and identity has still not . been made public. Terrorizing: Ahmed was said to be delusional and had left behind notes and a hostage negotiation book at his apartment . Family: The suspected gunman with relatives in LA. He moved to Louisiana with family after his father died 12 years ago . In talks: The police stormed the bank at around midnight after talks with the hostage-taker failed . Edmonson confirmed the release of a female bank teller late Tuesday. He said authorities were talking with her about her ordeal. Earlier Tuesday, Edmonson said that . the man had been calm and had made some demands, but he would not . describe the demands or further identify the gunman. 'We're still working with him to determine exactly what his intent is,' Edmonson said. The gunman, carrying at least a . handgun, took two women and a man captive about 12:30 p.m. at the Tensas . State Bank branch in St. Joseph, and a negotiator talked with him . throughout the afternoon, said Trooper Albert Paxton, a state police . spokesman. The red-brick bank is just off . Louisiana Highway 128, a rural stretch of road cutting through . cornfields. It is across the street from Trak convenience store, which . the gunman's family owns, in St. Joseph, the seat of Tensas Parish. Edmonson had earlier warned that the standoff could last for some time. 'Our utmost concern right now more than anything else is the safety of those hostages,' he said. More law enforcement people and equipment would be brought in, he said then. 'We've got to be prepared to act,' Edmonson said. Dangerous: Federal officers patrol the surrounding area of St. Joseph, Louisiana . The two hostages were released in what police described as a 'critical condition' before one of them died . The FBI, U.S. marshals, state police and local law enforcement officers were among those responding to the standoff. Edmonson provided few details about . the gunman, except to say he is originally from California and that his . family settled in the Louisiana community and opened a convenience . store. He said some of the suspect's relatives tried to approach the scene earlier, and that authorities were now working with them. Mayor Edward Brown said that, as a . general rule, the town's most notable crimes are the occasional drug . busts, and some residents are so frightened about what's happening that . they've left town. 'It's a quiet town. Very little crime. So this is amazing,' Brown said. The town of 1,200 is near the Mississippi River, downriver from Vicksburg, Miss., in northeast Louisiana. Paxton said he believed that the Trak . convenience store was evacuated, but there were few other occupied . buildings within the perimeter that state police and the FBI set up. Rural: Farm-worker Richardo Miles, 25, sits on his bike waiting for news of the hostages in the Tensas State Bank . Mobile command center: Officers from Louisiana State Police spent hours negotiating with the hostage-taker . Richardo Miles, a 25-year-old farmworker, said he lives about a half-mile from the bank. He sat on his bicycle at a roadblock . near an abandoned hardware store about a quarter-mile away, watching the . activities of dozens of first responders, including paramedics and . heavily armed men in camouflage. A helicopter circled overhead in the . overcast sky for a time as men, some carrying assault rifles, gathered . in the street in front of the bank. Law enforcement trucks also hauled in construction lights, apparently to prepare in case the standoff lasted into the night. Late Tuesday, authorities had received a request for food from those inside the bank building. The sight of the state police bomb squad and SWAT team unnerved many people in the sleepy farm town, Miles said. 'It's kind of startling for the . residents. We're not accustomed to this kind of activity,' said Miles. 'Some people are pretty scared. They're nervous.' Tensas Parish lies along Mississippi . River, but St. Joseph is about a mile from the riverbank and about two . miles from a 3,000-acre oxbow lake that long ago was one of the river's . bends. Nearly one-third of the parish's 5,000 residents live under the federal poverty level, according to U.S. Census figures. Farmland makes up more than 45 . percent of the 600-square-mile parish, with most of it in cotton, feed . grains, soybeans and wheat.","Suspect Fuaed Abdo Ahmed, 20, posted a cartoon strip featuring gunman pointing pistol at hostage on Sunday .

"A Missouri mom who claims her son was 'kidnapped' by social workers in a hospital on the grounds of medical child abuse is desperately fighting to regain custody. Michelle Rider says her son Isaiah - now 16 - has had health issues since he was child, beginning with breaking his leg at age six and the bones never fully recovering. At 15 his leg was partially amputated to fit a prosthetic, however there were complications, with the teen suffering tremors and intense pain after the surgery. After being transferred to numerous children's hospitals around the country, an MRI determined Isaiah had tumors on his leg and he was diagnosed with neurofibromitoisis. Fighting for her son: Michelle Rider says her sickly son, Isaiah, was wrongly taken away from her amid allegations of medical child abuse . Isaiah under surgery at Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago on March 31, but the tremors and pain persisted. Doctors suggested Isaiah manage without drugs. 'They couldn't help him, and I, as his parent, requested, ‘Please, get him help somewhere,' Rider told The Blaze. 'I wanted him transferred,' Rider said . Rider said she called an ethics meeting with her son’s doctors and social workers, asking that he be transferred to another hospital. Then on April 15, upon arriving at the hospital, Rider was met in the lobby by a social worker, who took her to a room with two doctors and another social worker, none of whom Rider had met before. The mom was then told Isaiah had been taken into emergency custody due to evidence of medical abuse. Doctors believed that Isaiah was coping better and improving when his mother was not around and that 'only pharmacological means can be used to treat pain', according to The Chicago Tribune. 'All attempts to … have [the] mother voluntarily partner with us in [the boy's] care have been futile and met with resistance,' the doctor's reported. 'In order to best develop a therapeutic medical plan for [the boy], we need to remove the mother from his care at the moment.' Poorly: Isaiah Rider has been in and out of hospital since the age of six, stemming from a broken leg that never properly healed . Stunned: Both mother and son said they did not understand what was happening when Isaiah was put into a foster home in Illinois . Isaiah was placed with a foster family in Illinois and Rider said she was left in complete shock. 'They literally did a hospital kidnapping,' she said. Isaiah has said he feels the same way as his mother and disagrees with what the doctors are saying. 'They kept telling me that .... my anxiety is my mom causing me pain. 'There were times [though] where I'd be in pain for hours at a time and they wouldn't give me anything. 'I needed, like, a muscle relaxer and they wouldn't give me anything for it. Told me to wait it through. 'That's immoral to me, when patient in pain needs medicine, give him some pain medicine. 'I was hurting so much at one point my nose bled. 'If I was a doctor, I'd be ashamed if I heard of other doctors doing stuff like this. They've been lying in the court.' Patient: Isaiah Rider and his mom Michelle have traveled to hospitals all over the country trying to find him the proper care . At the next custody hearing on August 11, Rider and her attorney, Randy Kretchmar, plan to challenge the case using an old federal law, which they believe has been violated. The Indian Child Welfare Act was passed in 1978 'protect the best interests of Indian children and to promote the stability and security of Indian tribes and families'. The law puts a greater emphasis on the proof to take temporary custody of Indian children. Kretchmar believes in this case there is no medical evidence that Rider had personally - physically or otherwise - wronged her son in any way. He also said that Isaiah fits the legal definition of an Indian child. Kretchmar said he understands that people will think that there is more to this story, but maintains there isn't. 'The system is something that needs to be radically confronted and resisted and changed and abolished,' he told The Blaze. Homesick: Isaiah said he longs to return home to his and family and friends in Missouri .

'They make their living from acting that way.' Missouri state Rep. Ken Wilson told TheBlaze he was stunned when he heard of Isaiah’s situation . 'These parents are hurting. What happened to them just should not happen to anyone else,'  Wilson said. 'Who can possibly believe that child is better off in a foster home in Chicago than in the family home?

"Scientists are worried about the world's declining honey bee population, which could devastate the  crops and lead to food shortages across the globe. Now, in a bid to stop the rapid decline, experts have fitted ‘backpack’ sensors to 5,000 bees in Australia to unravel why colonies there do not seem to be affected by  the ‘colony collapse disorder’ that is decimating bee populations in other countries. The research aims to improve honey bee pollination and productivity on farms as well. Scroll down for video . Scientists at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) have fitted 5,000 tiny sensors, measuring just 2.5mm squared to the backs of  honey bees in Hobart, Tasmania, before releasing them into the wild . To attach the ‘backpack’ sensors, the bees were refrigerated for a short period, which put them into a rest state. Researchers quickly glued the tiny RFID sensors to their backs while they were sleepy. After a few minutes, the honeybees woke up and were ready to return to their hive and start gathering valuable information. Dr . de Souza said: ‘This is a non-destructive process and the sensors . appear to have no impact on the bee's ability to fly and carry out its . normal duties.’ Scientists at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) have fitted 5,000 tiny sensors, measuring just 2.5mm squared to the backs of  honey bees in Hobart, Tasmania, before releasing them into the wild. It is the first time such large numbers of insects have been used for environmental monitoring. ‘Honey bees play a vital role in the landscape through a free pollination service for agriculture, which various crops rely on to increase yields’ said CSIRO science leader Dr Paulo de Souza, who is heading up the swarm sensing project. ‘A recent CSIRO study showed bee pollination in Faba beans can lead to a productivity increase of 17 per cent. ‘Around one third of the food we eat relies on pollination, but honey bee populations around the world are crashing because of the dreaded Varroa mite and Colony Collapse Disorder. ‘Thankfully, Australia is currently free from both of those threats,’ he added. The bees' high-tech backpacks (pictured) are tiny Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) sensors that record when an insect passes a particular check point. The information is then sent to a central location where researchers can build a three dimensional model and discover how the insects move through the landscape . The research will also look at the impacts of agricultural pesticides on honey bees by monitoring insects that feed at sites with trace amounts of commonly used chemicals. ‘Using this technology, we aim to understand the bee's relationship with its environment,’ said Dr de Souza. ‘This should help us understand optimal productivity conditions as well as further our knowledge of the cause of colony collapse disorder,’ in which worker bees from a beehive or European honey bee colony abruptly disappear. The bees’ high-tech backpacks are tiny Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) sensors that record when an insect passes a particular check point. The information is then sent remotely to a central location where researchers can use the signals from the 5,000 sensors to build a comprehensive three dimensional model and discover how the insects move through the landscape. Dr de Souza said: ‘Bees are social insects that return to the same point and operate on a very predictable schedule. There are only enough honeybees in Britain to properly pollinate a quarter of the country’s crops, scientists claim. Destruction . of huge swathes of grassland and the use of agricultural chemicals have . caused a spiralling drop in the populations of honeybees, which are . vital for food production. Professor . Simon Potts of the University of Reading, who led the research project, . said: ‘We face a catastrophe in future years unless we act now.’ The . research, published in the journal PLOS One, found that Europe has . 13.4million too few honeybee colonies to properly pollinate all its . crops. Bee populations . have plummeted as their meadowland habitats were concreted over and . their wildflower food supply killed by herbicides. Previous studies have estimated that the number of British honeybees have halved over the last 25 years. Scientists . think the bee shortfall is leading to reduced crop yields and they warn . that in future farmers may have to look at mechanical or hand . pollination. The new pesticide, Hv1a/GNA, has no effect on bees' learning, which is key to their foraging for food. Researchers said that the chemical cocktail has potential as an environmentally friendly 'bee safe' pesticide and an alternative to those suspected of decimating colonies. A stock image of crop spraying is pictured . 'Any change in their behaviour indicates a change in their environment. If we can model their movements, we'll be able to recognise very quickly when their activity shows variation and identify the cause. 'This will help us understand how to maximise their productivity as well as monitor for any biosecurity risks.' The scientists involved in the project believe that understanding bee behaviour will give farmers and fruit growers improved management knowledge, which will help them increase the benefit received from nature’s free pollination service. The researchers are working with the University of Tasmania, the Tasmanian Beekeepers Association, local beekeepers in Hobart and fruit growers around the state to trial the technology. The next stage of the project is to reduce the size of the sensors to only 1mm so they can be attached to smaller insects such as mosquitoes and fruit flies.","Scientists at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation are tracking a colony in Hobart, Tasmania .

"At least one man spent the night sleeping outside of a New York City bookstore in order to meet Hillary Clinton at a signing for her new memoir but he only got to spend five seconds with the former Secretary of State. Once the awaiting crowds were allowed inside the Barnes and Noble store in Union Square, they were handed a list of rules that stipulated that she would not pose for photographs with them or personalizing their signed books. The event was held as a kick off effort for her new book, Hard Choices, but apparently the buzz from a string of news interviews and personal appearances such this morning's event at Barnes and Noble are not helping a great deal. Book trial: Many have seen the release of her latest memoir and ensuing book tour as a preamble to a likely 2016 presidential run, though she says she has not made a decision about the race (pictured Tuesday at the New York City Barnes and Noble) On sale: All major bookstores are selling the 656-page tome for 40 per cent off the sticker price, knocking it down to $21 from $35 . A Books A Million store in McLean, Virginia just outside of D.C. has already marked the price of the tome down by 40 per cent for loyalty members and 30 per cent to the general public. Sunday Times reporter Toby Harnden shared a picture via Twitter that showed the markdown on the book, noting that a Books A Million manager said that it was 'very unusual' to have a new book immediately marked off at more than 20 per cent. The manager said the sale 'really threw me'. They were not the only store to knock the price of Mrs Clinton's book down dramatically, as Amazon is also selling the hardcover edition for $21, which marks a 40 per cent cut to the sticker price of $35. Even Barnes and Noble was selling it at the same lowered price, and a spokeswoman from the bookstore told The New York Times . that the turnout did not stand out- even though there were a handful of . die-hards who spent the night on the sidewalk to get a good spot. The . spokeswoman said that the author of The Hunger Games and actor James . Franco drew similarly-sized crowds as well as Democratic Senator . Elizabeth Warren. Get in line: The crowd wrapped around the block and a spokeswoman for the Barnes and Noble said that it was about the same number of people who attended signings by James Franco and Elizabeth Warren . Rallying support: The Ready for Hillary political action committee has already raised millions in expectation of her run though she has repeatedly said that she will not have a firm answer until the end of the year . That said, Justin Bieber and the Jonas Brothers apparently drew bigger crowds when they had their own signings. Sean Brennan was one of the ones who stuck it out, however, and he is used to pulling all-nighters for authors he cares about. Business Insider spoke to the 41-year-old Queens native who said that he has waited outside twice for two different signings by her husband, former President Bill Clinton, as well as the late Maya Angelou and all of the Harry Potter releases. He, like many Clinton supporters, knows full well that she has not officially announced her expected 2016 presidential run but Mr Brennan felt the urge to reiterate his support. 'That's what I'm going to say to her if I get my five seconds as she's signing the book,' he told Business Insider reporter Hunter Walker. 'I'm going to say that I know it's really selfish, but we are selfish and we really need her to run. We do really need her to run.'","Amazon, Barnes and Noble and Books A Million are all selling the book with a sizable discount .

"Incensed: Kate Humble says the public don't value their food enough and waste far too much . TV presenter Kate Humble has claimed food is not expensive enough. The 45-year-old Lambing Live star accused the public of not valuing food because it was too cheap - and they were disconnected from the farming process. Humble, who has presented popular science and wildlife programmes for the past 15 years, told the Guardian: ‘Food waste is endemic but we don’t value food because it’s not expensive enough. ‘Four pints of milk for a quid, are you kidding me? And the reason we can buy that without thinking of the implications is because we’re so disconnected from the land and farming process.’ But with food prices rising, the former Springwatch presenter’s comments may infuriate some. Earlier this week, a charity claimed it had handed out than a million emergency food parcels last year. Mrs Humble was speaking at her 117-acre former council farm in Trellech, Monmouth, which she runs with her TV director husband Ludo Graham. Supermarket and restaurant prices are set to rise through the course of the year as food inflation outstrips general inflation. She added: ‘Everyone’s going to hate me and call me a middle-class b**** but I’m past caring because I’m so incensed.’ Humble said: ¿Food waste is endemic but we don¿t value food because it¿s not expensive enough.","Lambing Live presenter said food waste is 'endemic'

"Controversial 'pick up artist' Julien Blanc has posted a domestic abuse chart on his Twitter page calling it a 'checklist' for 'how to make her stay'. The diagram was originally designed by a domestic abuse charity to help women identify when they are being abused, and has sections entitled 'use male privilege' and 'use isolation'. The post, which has now been hidden online, came as  minister Lynne Featherstone urged Home Secretary Theresa May to ban Blanc from coming to Britain. Scroll down for video . 'Dating guru' Julien Blanc posted this chart - designed to help women identify when they are being abused - on his Twitter page calling it a 'checklist' for 'how to make her stay' American-born Blanc runs £2,000-a-head 'dating seminars' for men and is due to come to the UK on November 21, but a petition calling for entry to be blocked has already reached topped 120,000 signatures . He is due to be in this country on November 21 to host a seminar on pick up techniques, but an online petition calling for him to be denied entry has already attracted 120,000 signatures. American-born Blanc was forced to cut a visit to Australia short due to widespread protests at his dating techniques, which include choking women, threatening to commit suicide, injuring their pets and isolating them from friends. Crime minister Ms Featherstone said: 'I am extremely concerned by the sexist and utterly abhorrent statements Julien Blanc has made about women. 'If he was allowed to perform in the UK I have no doubt that cases of sexual harassment and intimidation would increase. 'Free speech is obviously hugely important, but with free speech comes responsibility. It is not appropriate to talk about choking girls under any circumstances.' Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has also called for Mr Blanc to be barred from the UK, saying his £2,000-a-head seminar is not 'conducive to public good'. Blanc's 'techniques' for picking up women includes choking them (pictured), injuring their pets, threatening to commit suicide, and isolating them from their friends . Blanc had to cut his recent trip to Australia short after widespread protests demanding that he leave . Mr Blanc has made a name for himself by being what he describes as an 'executive coach' at a company called Real Social Dynamics, which he calls an 'international leader in dating advice'. It promises customers the chance to 'witness dating coaches attract beautiful women in live demonstrations'. But videos and pictures of Blanc in action suggest he encourages men to harass women with the aim of having sex with them. A video of one of his seminar in Japan shows him saying that 'white men... can do what you want' in Tokyo, suggesting that men grab women's heads and thrust them towards their crotch. Sarah Green, from the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: 'His so-called pick up coaching promotes behaviour amounting to sexual harassment and sexual assault. Crime minister Lynne Featherstone and shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper have both called on Teresa May to block Blanc from being allowed entry to the UK . 'More broadly, he is part of a culture which trivialises abuse of women and racism. At worst this tells victims of abuse that what has happened to them doesn't matter, and gives potential abusers the nod that such behaviour will not be taken seriously.' A Home Office spokesman said: 'All visa applications are considered on their individual merits in line with the immigration rules. 'The Home Secretary has the power to exclude an individual if she considers that his or her presence in the UK is not conducive to the public good.'","Julien Blanc posted image online with message '#HowToMakeHerStay'

"Facebook has reversed its policy on what happens to a person's page once they die. From today, the page will retain the same settings as when the person was alive. Previously, the 'memorialised' pages were only visible to the deceased's friends. The Facebook team said they decided to make a dramatic change to their policy to reflect a user's privacy settings in life . Facebook said it was making the changes after consulting with users. 'Some of the people who reach out to us are grieving the death of a friend or family member, and they usually ask for their loved one's timeline to be memorialized. 'Over the past several months, we've been thinking about and working on better ways for people to remember loved ones. 'As we continue to think through each aspect of memorialization, we ask ourselves questions that have no easy answers: How might people feel? Are we honoring the wishes and legacy of the person who passed away? Are we serving people who are grieving the loss of a loved one as best we can?' The team said they decided to make a dramatic change to their policy. 'Up to now, when a person's account was memorialized, we restricted its visibility to friends-only. 'This meant that people could no longer see the account or any of its content unless they were Facebook friends with the person who passed away. 'Starting today, we will maintain the visibility of a person's content as-is. 'This will allow people to see memorialized profiles in a manner consistent with the deceased person's expectations of privacy. Facebook said it was making the changes after consulting with users who had suffered bereavements . 'We are respecting the choices a person made in life while giving their extended community of family and friends ongoing visibility to the same content they could always see.' The firm also said it would offer families the opportunity to see a person's “Look Back” video. 'In recognition of our ten-year anniversary, a group of our engineers created personal movies for people using some of the posts and photos they had shared over the years. 'For one man in Missouri, the Look Back video he was most desperate to watch was one that had not yet been made.

'We had not initially made the videos for memorialized accounts, but John's request touched the hearts of everyone who heard it, including ours. 'Since then, many others have asked us to share the Look Back videos of their loved ones, too, and we're now glad to be able to fulfill those requests.'

"Fox News personality and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee stunned a New Hampshire crowd on Saturday by likening the federal government's treatment of airport passengers to the totalitarian regime of Kim Jong-un. 'My gosh, I'm beginning to think that there's more freedom in North Korea sometimes than there is in the United States,' he told a partisan crowd at the inaugural New Hampshire Freedom Summit. 'When I go to the airport, I have to get into the surrender position, people put hands all over me, and I have to provide photo ID in a couple of different forms to prove that I'm not going to terrorize the airplane,' he deadpanned. In a speech filled with jokes, Huckabee seemed deadly serious. Trouble: Huckabee drew a mix of gasps and applause when he suggested that airport security represents a loss of freedom akin to North Korea's . 'More freedom': Huckabee compared Americans' treatment in domestic airports to the North Korean government's treatment of its people . 'Surrender position': U.S. airline passengers can expect occasional pat-downs from Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agents before they are allowed into boarding areas . Americans welcomed additional security measures after the 9/11 terror attacks but have since grown weary of agents who get up close and personal . His criticism of the Transportation Safety Administration was a segue into his objection to the national debate of voter ID requirements at the polls. 'If I want to go vote, I don't need a thing,' he said. 'All I gotta to do is show up and I can give 'em anybody's name, and that's okay.' The laughs returned when he quipped that 'the president reminded us yesterday that there's no voter fraud.' Barack Obama said Friday during a speech to MSNBC host Al Sharpton's National Action Network pressure group that claims of widespread voter fraud – the justification offered by conservatives for laws requiring photo IDs at the polls – are 'bogus.' 'Let's be clear,' Obama said.: 'The real voter fraud is people who try to deny our rights by making bogus arguments about voter fraud.' Huckabee is an ordained Southern Baptist minister and sometimes musician who served as the governor of Arkansas for 11 years and now hosts a weekend variety show on the Fox News Channel. He mounted an unsuccessful presidential campaign in 2008, and his name has surfaced again as a possible 2016 White House candidate. But even if he never reaches 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, he joked that he might show up there unannounced one day for a tour. When the Secret Service asked him for a photo ID, he said, he would say, 'I figured if I can vote without one, I ought to be able to come in and look around without one too.' Conservatives at the inaugural New Hampshire Freedom Summit in Manchester turned the parking lot into a carnival of political bumper stickers, including this nod to the tea party . Stern: Fresh from his speech at the 2014 New Hampshire Freedom Summit, Huckabee met with reporters for a brief press conference . Really? North Korean communist leader Kim Jong-un presides over one of the world's most repressive totalitarian regimes, imprisoning millions of his people and restricting economic activity and travel . Huckabee complained about having to produce a government-issued ID in order to pass through airport security -- a measure that's not required when Americans visit the polls on Election Day . Huckabee ended a day full of conservative speakers including former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, business tycoon Donald Trump, and U.S. senators Rand Paul, Mike Lee and Ted Cruz. Nearly everyone took shots at the IRS, which has raised Republicans' collective blood pressure since news broke 11 months ago that the agency was playing political favorites and targeting right-wing organizations for special scrutiny. Mercurial: Huckabee's audience knows him as a jovial figure and a sensible television host, but the buzz in New Hampshire reflected a consensus that he had gone too far . Huckabee scowled at 'the criminal enterprise formerly known as the Internal Revenue Service ... that is able to crush any citizen, any organization.' 'It is the one type of entity in America,' he complained, 'where you are guilty until you can prove yourself to be not guilty.' A shift in the law away from income taxes, and toward taxes on sales and consumption – what advocates call the Fair Tax – 'would rid us of the IRS,' he said. Later, Huckabee told MailOnline that he's serious about doing away with the IRS entirely. 'Most states have their own taxing authority and tax auditing capability,' Huckabee said. 'It could be handled with the states.' 'When I look at what they have become, and threat that they are to the liberty of Americans, it's very frightening to me.' 'For them to take personal, confidential information of taxpayers, or groups, and to share that information illegally in a way to try to hurt those individuals and groups? That's criminal,' he added. 'We shouldn't be sponsoring, paying for, subsidizing and legislating a criminal enterprise. MailOnline asked if there were other federal agencies that he thought should be scrapped. 'I'm not a candidate,' he cautioned. 'So let me hold off on giving you the full platform.'","Huckabee is a preacher, a former Arkansas governor, a Fox News host and a potential presidential candidate .

"Prosecutors on Wednesday abandoned their 30-year pursuit of the execution of convicted police killer Mumia Abu-Jamal, the former Black Panther whose claim that he was the victim of a racist legal system made him an international cause celebre. Abu-Jamal, 58, will instead spend the rest of his life in prison. His writings and radio broadcasts from death row had put him at the centre of an international debate over capital punishment. Flanked by Officer Daniel Faulkner's widow, Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams announced his decision two days short of the 30th anniversary of the white policeman's killing. Cause celebre: Prosecutors will no longer pursue the death penalty against former Black Panther Mumia Abu-Jamal . He said continuing to seek the death penalty could lead to 'an unknowable number of years' of appeals, and that some witnesses have died or are unavailable after nearly three decades. 'There's never been any doubt in my mind that Mumia Abu-Jamal shot and killed Officer Faulkner. I believe that the appropriate sentence was handed down by a jury of his peers in 1982,' said Mr Williams, the city's first black district attorney. 'While Abu-Jamal will no longer be facing the death penalty, he will remain behind bars for the rest of his life, and that is where he belongs.' Abu-Jamal was originally sentenced to death. His murder conviction was upheld through years of appeals. But in 2008, a federal appeals court ordered a new sentencing hearing on the grounds that the instructions given to the jury were potentially misleading. Torment: Widow Maureen Faulkner say she and her family 'endured a three-decade ordeal at the hands of Mumia Abu-Jamal' After the U.S. Supreme Court declined to weigh in two months ago, prosecutors were forced to decide whether to pursue the death penalty again or accept a life sentence without parole. Mr Williams said he reached the decision with the blessing of Faulkner's widow, Maureen. 'Another penalty proceeding would open the case to the repetition of the state appeals process and an unknowable number of years of federal review again, even if we were successful,' the district attorney said. Widowed: Maureen's husband, Daniel Faulkner, was killed in 1982 after an altercation with Abu-Jamal. Advocates for the former Black Panther said he was victim to a biased legal system . Widener University law professor Judith Ritter, who represented Abu-Jamal in recent appeals, welcomed the move. 'There is no question that justice is served when a death sentence from a misinformed jury is overturned,' Ms Ritter said. 'Thirty years later, the district attorney's decision not to seek a new death sentence also furthers the interests of justice.' According to trial testimony, Abu-Jamal saw his brother scuffle with the patrolman during a 4am traffic stop in 1981 and ran toward the scene. Cause celebre: Mumia Abu-Jamal inspired people to protest capital punishment and what they saw as an unfair sentencing . Police found Abu-Jamal wounded by a round from Mr Faulkner's gun. Mr Faulkner, shot several times, was killed. A .38 calibre revolver registered to Abu-Jamal was found at the scene with five spent shell casings. Over the years, Abu-Jamal challenged the predominantly white makeup of the jury, the instructions given to the jurors and the accounts of eyewitnesses. 'I will not stand by and see him coddled, as he has been in the past. And I am heartened that he will be taken from the protective cloister he has been living in all these years and begin living among his own kind — the thugs and common criminals that infest our prisons.' -Widow Maureen Faulkner . He also said that his lawyer was ineffective, that the judge was racist and that another man confessed to the crime. The one-time journalist's own 1995 book, 'Live From Death Row,' depicts prison life and calls the justice system racist. He . got worldwide support from the 'Free Mumia' movement, with hundreds of . vocal supporters and death-penalty opponents regularly turning out for . court hearings in his case. His . message resonated on college campuses and in Hollywood. Actors Mike . Farrell and Tim Robbins were among dozens of luminaries who used a New . York Times ad to call for a new trial, and the Beastie Boys played a . concert to raise money for Abu-Jamal's defence. Mr Faulkner's widow laboured to ensure her husband was not forgotten. 'My family and I have endured a three-decade ordeal at the hands of Mumia Abu-Jamal, his attorneys and his supporters, who in many cases never even took the time to educate themselves about the case before lending their names, giving their support and advocating for his freedom,' she said Wednesday. Celebrity support: The Beastie Boys played a concert to raise money for Abu-Jamal's defence . 'All of this has taken an unimaginable physical, emotional and financial toll on each of us.' Amnesty . International, which maintains that Abu-Jamal's trial was 'manifestly . unfair and failed to meet international fair trial standards,' said the . district attorney's decision does not go far enough. Abu-Jamal still has an appeal pending before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court over the validity of ballistics evidence. 'Amnesty International continues to believe that justice would best be served by granting Mumia Abu-Jamal a new trial,' said Laura Moye, director of the human rights group's Campaign to Abolish the Death Penalty. Live from death row: The former journalist published a book in 1995 which detailed what he calls a racist judicial system . Members of Philadelphia's police community stood with Mr Williams and Maureen Faulkner as the decision was announced. Former police union president Rich Costello criticized the courts for ordering a new sentencing hearing. 'Where do Maureen and the Faulkner family go for a reduction in their sentence?' Costello said. 'For 30 years now, they have been forced to suffer grief, anguish, abuse, insults, intimidation, threats and every other sort of indignity that can be visited on a family already in grief.' Mrs Faulkner lashed out at the judges who overturned the death sentence, calling them 'dishonest cowards' who, she said, oppose the death penalty. The widow also vowed to fight any special treatment for Abu-Jamal behind bars, saying he should be moved to the general population after being taken off death row. 'I will not stand by and see him coddled, as he has been in the past,' Mrs Faulkner said. 'And I am heartened that he will be taken from the protective cloister he has been living in all these years and begin living among his own kind — the thugs and common criminals that infest our prisons.'","Mumia Abu-Jamal convicted of 1981 killing of Philadelphia officer Daniel Faulkner .

"Breast enlargement might be the UK's most popular cosmetic operation but for Sharon, 51, from the West Midlands, having large breasts is a curse. A 34D for most of her adult life, Sharon was left in excruciating pain after her breasts increased by nine cup sizes to a 40L following a hysterectomy. So agonising was the back pain that resulted, Sharon was forced to take daily doses of morphine and found herself unable to sit at the supper table or even stand up unaided because of her gargantuan bosom. Painful: Sharon's breasts grew nine sizes in just two years, leaving her in agony and unable to stand unaided . Shocked: GP Dr Pixie McKenna said that Sharon's breasts were the largest she's ever seen . 'They've just grown and grown and grown,' says Sharon, who appears on tonight's episode of Embarrassing Bodies. 'I'm in excruciating pain sometimes, they're just horrible things.' Indeed, so large have Sharon's breasts become, Embarrassing Bodies GP Dr Pixie McKenna was left shocked and revealed they were the largest she had ever seen. Sharon's problems began when she hit the menopause aged 45, with the drop in hormones resulting in a lessening of support for her breasts. As her hormones declined, her breasts grew and with them, back pain, neck pain and a series of itchy rashes beneath her breasts. 'You could fry an egg under there,' jokes Sharon, who spends hours applying ointment and talcum powder in a bid to minimise the pain. Despite her jokes, the effect on Sharon's confidence has been devastating. 'When I first knew Sharon. she was always dancing and singing and very jolly,' says husband Sam. 'To see her now... That's not the Sharon I'm used to seeing.' But after years of pain, Sharon's ordeal has come to an end, courtesy of a breast reduction operation at the Ramsey West Midlands Hospital. Under the watchful eye of plastic surgeon Sultan Hassan, the 51-year-old endured more than four hours on the operating table, as 6kg of breast tissue was removed. She has also had to begin physiotherapy in a bid to combat the hunched posture she developed as a result of her L cup breasts. Getting help: Sharon was helped by Dr Pixie McKenna (right) seen with her Embarrassing Bodies colleagues . Nevertheless, she says she is thrilled to be rid of her uncomfortably large breasts. 'It's made me feel like a woman again because all I had was these big saggy boobs but now they're amazing,' she reveals. 'I couldn't have asked for a better result.' Her new-look bosom has also given her confidence a huge boost. 'I still can't believe it's me,' she enthuses. 'It means the world to me that I've had this operation done. I feel more confident, I feel more of a woman. I've actually got boobs and not big dangly things hanging down on my hips. 'Wearing a bra was so uncomfortable with all the sores and things under my breasts but now that's all gone! She adds: 'I can't wait to get a bikini and show my boobs off.'

Burnell showed no emotion as the jury foreman returned the verdict. Adjourning sentencing for reports, Judge Graham Hume Jones told Burnell: 'You have to come back to court to be sentenced. 'You will be told when to attend court so you must keep in contact with your solicitor. 'You will be given bail.' The pair started the high-speed game - . which forced other drivers to swerve to avoid being hit - after Jones . yelled 'I'll catch her, I'll catch her' to a friend, a jury was told. He later admitted causing death by . dangerous driving, but his girlfriend Burnell denied the same charge and . went on trial at Taunton Crown Court today. Support: Jane Hofmeister (centre) holds the hand of her son Ben, 17, as she and family and friends leave Taunton Crown Court following the conviction today . However, William Hunter, prosecuting, told the court that Burnell was also instrumental in causing the accident. He said: 'She was effectively encouraging Leonard Jones to drive dangerously by egging him on smiling and smirking at him.' Describing what happened, Mr Hunter . added: 'Just over a year ago to the day 13-year-old Amy Hofmeister was . with her friend Lucy Hawkins, riding their bicycles on a cycle path. 'A Vauxhall Vectra mounted the pavement and overturned, hitting both cyclists. Amy Hofmeister was killed. 'The Vauxhall Vectra was Leonard Jones'. He has pleaded guilty to the death of Amy Hofmeister by dangerous driving. 'He was driving too fast because, the prosecution say, he was playing a high-speed game of chase - or racing - with another car. 'He was winning that game. He had just overtaken that other car. That Ford Focus was being driven by the defendant. 'The prosecution's case is that by . playing this high speed, dangerous game on a built up road, where the . speed limit is 30mph, Amy Hofmeister was killed. 'The defendant was playing games with Leonard Jones and is jointly responsible for the death.' Taunton Crown Court was told that . Amy, who dreamed of becoming a school teacher, died in the collision on . Blackbrook Way, in Taunton, Somerset, on June 15 last year. Her friend Lucy Hawkins was also injured, but survived. Hundreds of tributes: Flowers and cards line the pavement where Amy died . Missed: Friends left photographs and messages to Amy at the crash scene in Taunton, Somerset . The jury was told that Jones and . Burnell, both from Taunton, had gone to eat at the nearby Harvester pub . at around 5pm - leaving just before the crash. Witnesses described seeing Burnell speed off in her Ford Focus, with Jones and friend Larry Grant following behind the Vectra. CCTV pictures showed the cars . accelerating out of a Murco garage, next-door to the Harvester, before . entering a bus lane and careering down the road. Witness Sharon Symonds described the two cars as 'playing games with each other', the court heard. Mr Hunter told the jury: 'She says . she saw the defendant turn around to the car behind her and smirk - . showing, the prosecution says, that they were playing games with each . other.' The cars continued to race down the . road, crossing a roundabout before turning onto Blackbrook way, where . Jones overtook the Ford Focus, the court heard. Oncoming driver Tina Beckhurst later . told police she was forced to slow down and swerve out of the way, as . Jones passed the Ford Focus on a bend. Vectra passenger Larry Grant, giving . evidence, told the court the car reached 80mph in the 'chase' and . estimated Burnell's Focus would have been travelling at around 60mph. The witness, who was also injured in . the crash, said Jones had told him 'I'll catch her, I'll catch her' as . he sped towards Burnell. He said: 'I told him to slow down. I was panicking because of the speed he was driving - it was reckless. 'We hit the curb and flipped over. I cant recall seeing anything.' Accused: Leanne Burnell, 21, leaves Taunton Crown Court today. She was playing a 'high speed, dangerous game' on a 30mph road when a 13-year-old girl was killed, the prosecution said . Devastated: Amy Hofmeister's mother Jane (Right) leaves Taunton Crown Court accompanied by a police officer . Jones was arrested at the scene - but lied to police and told them another friend, who had fled, was driving. Burnell was arrested later that evening and also lied to the police. She claimed to have only been travelling at between 20 to 25mph and had not gone on the same route as her boyfriend. Burnell also said that Jones was speeding but her car was 'chugging' as it was low on fuel. Recalling the crash, she said: 'It all happened so fast. He was overtaking me. I’d slowed right down to let him get in front because of a vehicle coming on facing us. 'He got back in front of me, which is when the accident happened where he hit the kerb. 'His car rolled. I panicked, I was in shock. I pulled up my car and put my hazards on. I ran to the Vectra. I couldn’t see nothing. I ran for help.” Burnell denied racing Jones and said he and his passenger were 'acting like idiots” by speeding up behind her and then slowing down. Jones, of Mulberry Close, Taunton, was not in court and remains in custody. Burnell, of Bishop’s Hull, also Taunton, was released on bail. Both will be sentenced later on a date to be fixed.

"Tony Blair has warned that terrorism motivated by religious extremism is growing and the West needs a global strategy to tackle it . Tony Blair has warned that terrorism motivated by religious extremism is growing and the West needs a global strategy to tackle it. The former prime minister said the battles of the 21st century will no longer be about extreme political ideology like the last. Alongside security measures, including military action, the West must tackle conflicts by educating people about religious tolerance, he added. 'The fact is that, though of course there are individual grievances or reasons for the violence in each country, there is one thing self-evidently in common: the acts of terrorism are perpetrated by people motivated by an abuse of religion. 'It is a perversion of faith. But there is no doubt that those who commit the violence often do so by reference to their faith and the sectarian nature of the conflict is a sectarianism based on religion. 'There is no doubt either that this phenomenon is growing, not abating.' He said recent terror attacks and violence, including those in Syria, Libya and Iraq as well as Nigeria, Russia, and Asia, cannot be viewed as separate acts of killing but need a global strategy. The challenge could 'define the nature of peace and conflict'. 'The battles of this century are less likely to be the product of extreme political ideology - like those of the 20th century - but they could easily be fought around the questions of cultural or religious difference,' he added. 'The answer is to promote views that are open-minded and tolerant towards those who are different, and to fight the formal, informal and internet propagation of close-minded intolerance. In the 21st century, education is a security issue.' He announced the creation of a new online forum and database run by his Faith Foundation in collaboration with the Harvard Divinity School, which he hopes will become the world's leading source of information and debate about religion and conflict. British victims of the IRA are planning to sue Tony Blair for allegedly conniving with Gaddafi to block compensation over Semtex used in attacks which had been supplied by Libya. Mr Blair has been accused of helping to broker an agreement between the former Libyan leader and President George W Bush which resulted in Libya paying £1billion in compensation to American victims of terrorism but ended compensation hopes of the British victims of IRA attacks. Jason McCue of McCue & Partners is representing around 200 British victims of IRA attacks carried out with Semtex supplied by Libya. Prime Minister Tony Blair (left) embraces Gaddafi (right) after a meeting on May 29, 2007 in Sirte, Libya . He told the Daily Telegraph: 'It's bad enough being a victim of Semtex bombs supplied by Libya for the Provisional IRA campaign. '[But] it's sheer horror then to be informed that the British government and Tony Blair may have connived with Gaddafi to ensure the few brave British victims that justly sued and stood up to the dictator received no compensation from the Libyans,' he said. But a spokeswoman for Mr Blair said: 'The story is absurd and wrong. Mr Blair was not involved in the issue of compensation at all. 'He has never had anything to do with it and he has never discussed any such terms. 'The letter they cite is not evidence of involvement on this issue all it reflects is government policy of the time which was to reengage with the Libyans after they gave up their WMD programme and chose to cooperate rather than sponsor terrorism.' A Foreign Office spokesman added: 'The Government believes compensation claims are best pursued directly with the Libyan government through private campaigns. 'The claim that Government officials took any deliberate action that denied other UK victims compensation in the 2008 settlement is wrong.'","Former prime minister said the West must tackle conflicts by educating people about religious tolerance .

"In view of his much-publicised . troubled love life, an audience with the Pope was probably the last . thing Francois Hollande needed right now. Nevertheless, . the somewhat sheepish French president fulfilled that obligation . yesterday as it emerged that his estranged girlfriend Valerie . Trierweiler is also determined to carry on with her duties. Miss . Trierweiler, recovering from an apparent drugs overdose after learning . of Mr Hollande’s two-year affair with an actress, is keeping a charity . commitment in India this weekend. French President Francois Hollande, left, is welcomed by Pope Francis on the occasion of their private audience at the Vatican on Friday . Her trip is being seen by some as her ‘last stand’ as First Lady. Mr Hollande, who visited Rome with the threat of a reprimand from Pope Francis over France’s decision to allow gay marriage also hanging over him, is believed to be considering leaving Miss Trierweiler  for actress Julie Gayet, 41. Despite the unfortunate timing, yesterday’s private meeting with the Pope passed off without any further embarrassment for Mr Hollande – with Francis even showing his lighter side by joking about their shared name. For 48-year-old Miss Trierweiler, the trip to Mumbai on behalf of a French aid organisation is in her capacity as official escort to the French leader. She will visit a slum in the city and will be a guest of honour at a gala dinner. A friend hinted that the visit could be her swansong in the limelight. ‘It’s a way of showing that she is attached to humanitarian causes and that she will continue to take an interest in them whatever happens in the days to come,’ she told a French newspaper.

"Former Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. was sentenced to two and a half years in prison Wednesday for illegally spending $750,000 in campaign funds on personal items, the judge scolding the son of the famed civil rights leader for using the money as a 'piggy bank' and sentencing his wife to a year as well. However, Jackson, who emotionally apologized to his father, mother, congressional colleagues and others, was given significantly less prison time than federal guidelines recommend, recognized by the judge as a 'complex person' who has done both good and bad. Sandra Jackson, a former Chicago alderman, was sentenced for filing false joint federal income tax returns. Scroll down for video . Former Illinois Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. and his wife, Sandra, seen arriving at federal court in Washington, Wednesday, Aug. 14, 2013 . Jackson's wife Sandi was sentenced to 12 months in federal prison . After prison, the former congressman . is to spend three years on supervised release and complete 500 hours of . community service. If he earns credit for good behavior in prison, he . could end up serving closer to two years. He agreed to repay the . $750,000 when he pleaded guilty earlier this year. According . to court documents, the Jacksons had spent campaign money on TV's, . restaurant dinners, an expensive watch and other costly personal items. Jackson, . 48, had been a Democratic congressman from Illinois from 1995 until he . resigned last November. In an emotional speech to the judge, he choked . up and used tissues to blow his nose. He apologized and said he wanted . to 'take responsibility for my actions.' 'I . misled the American people. I misled the House of Representatives. I . misled the Federal Election Commission,' he said. 'I was wrong.' 'I also want to apologize to my dad and to my mother,' Jackson added, stopping to compose himself. The . elder Jackson, who sat in the front row during the proceedings, told a . crush of reporters outside the courthouse later: 'This has been an . extraordinarily difficult time for our family.' In . court, U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson recognized Jackson Jr.'s . public service on issues such as public education and clean water. 'That's what makes this situation so tragic,' she said. The one-time power couple misused $750,000 in campaign money on everything from a gold-plated Rolex watch and mink capes to vacations and mounted elk heads . But . the judge said that if she gave him no jail time it would send a . message that there are two systems: one for the well-connected and one . for everyone else. 'I cannot . do it. I will not do it,' she said, adding that as a public official, . Jackson was expected to 'live up to a higher standard of ethics and . integrity.' She also said that Jackson's actions could not be excused . because of mental illness. He has been treated for bipolar disorder. Federal . sentencing guidelines called for a prison term of 46 to 57 months — or . just under four years to just under five years. The government had . recommended four years, while Jackson's lawyers had asked that his . sentenced be limited to 18 months. Jackson's lawyer, Reid H. Weingarten, said the case lacked the typical victim found in most criminal cases. 'There are not widows and orphans surrounding the courtroom wanting his head,' Weingarten said. But prosecutor Matt Graves said the crime was serious: 'These were extreme abuses,' he said. Sandra . Jackson will be permitted to serve her sentence after her husband . completes his. The couple, who have two children, 13 and 9, asked to . serve at separate times. 'I . stand before you today asking for mercy,' Sandra Jackson said. 'My heart . breaks every day with the pain that it's caused my babies.' Her . lawyer, Dan Webb, tried to persuade the judge to spare his client jail . time, arguing that it would be an 'unbearable burden' on the children. But the judge old Mrs. Jackson, 'It is not the court that put your . children in this position.' Having . their mother gone will be difficult for the children, the judge said, . but 'it is survivable.' She said, 'Today you have to be held out as an . example.' Sandra Jackson . also was ordered to serve 200 hours of community service and pay . restitution of $22,000 — the amount of money she took from her . alderman's campaign account for personal use. The Jacksons, who pleaded guilty in February, entered the courtroom holding hands. The judge said Jesse Jackson's reporting date for prison would be on or after Nov. 1. As . he got into his SUV to leave, Jackson said, 'I still believe in the . power of forgiveness. I believe in the power of redemption. Today I . manned up and tried to accept responsibility for the errors of my ways— . and I still believe in the resurrection.' The . former congressman's father sat in the front row during the . proceedings, surveying the courtroom and writing notes on a piece of . paper while waiting for the hearing to start. During a break just before . the sentences were announced, he walked over to the defense table and . sat down next to his son, who slouched in his chair.

After the sentencing, the senior Jackson walked over to the prosecution table and shook hands with the prosecutors. Weingarten . told reporters that his camp was satisfied with the court's rulings .

I’m on a dinner, bed and breakfast rate (£148), for which I get three courses in the main dining room. But there isn’t a soul in it, so I opt for a table in the bar. I ask to order from the bar food menu rather than the posh one along the corridor. A waiter says he will find out if that’s possible because there might be a supplement. ‘But the bar menu is cheaper than the restaurant menu,’ I tell him. He goes off to check with the manager, but then a cheery East European waitress cuts through the dross and says I can order what I like from whatever menu I like. Thank you. And you know what? I go down the incongruous Malaysian route - and then regret it. The beef curry tastes almost as awful as it looks - a brown mess with coconut spread on it like flakes of dandruff. I notice that a woman sitting on her own at a nearby table has asked for her main course to be removed and, no, she does not want it replaced. Several conferences are gearing up in the morning. The buffet breakfast involves lots of stainless steel containers, with under-cooked bacon and watery scrambled eggs in them. At checkout, I’m asked if ‘everything was all right with your stay?’ I mumble and reach for a credit card. The Manor Hotel . Barnet Lane . Elstree .

"Rating: . Heaven knows what James Sherwood would make of this. The American tycoon occupied Sea Containers House for many years. It was the HQ for his shipping company, and then his Orient Express trains and hotels. On the top floor, he made sure there was the biggest boardroom in London, if not the world. It stretched the entire length of the building. Great location, shame about the general service: The Inspector found the Mondrian to be rather overpriced . Now it's the Mondrian London hotel - and while this American outfit has maintained something of a nautical theme (there's a submarine hanging over the restaurant bar and various models of container ships are dotted about), the vibe is super-cool, courtesy of designer Tom Dixon. It's the sort of place where you wear dark glasses when it's raining. And where you don't flinch when bumping into Russell Brand coming out of the loo, or when being charged £10 for an ordinary glass of vino. It's day two when we're there, but please don't give me all that guff about teething trouble. Not at these prices. Our shoebox costs £221 room only, for which we get some plastic art on the wall that looks like cows' udders. The bed is at an angle, presumably in an attempt to make the room more interesting. No bath. No heated towel rail. One small bottle of water. Sealed windows. And it's not as if many of the rooms actually look out over the Thames. Mind you, the views of St Paul's Cathedral from the main bar are splendid. We order a couple of drinks, but it takes the barman ages to produce them. The music is too loud, but it doesn't matter because most people are taking photographs of each other rather than conversing. We love our table in the restaurant. We are near a window, and can watch joggers, skateboarders and cyclists flashing past. Trouble is, the menu is complicated, with far too many categories: small plates; raw; flatbreads; market salads; larger dishes and 'dishes for the table, served family style'. 'What does that mean?' we ask. 'We normally recommend two people to share,' says our waiter. The ribeye comes in at £71 - I would want to feed the whole family for that. With no desserts and two glasses of wine each, our bill for dinner is £121. Oh, and if you order a newspaper, it'll cost you £3. Climbing into bed I feel something plastic rubbing against me. Could be worse - it's a glove left by whoever made up the bed. Sorry to bang on about money, but go for the Sea Containers Breakfast Table and it costs £19. My wife has a yogurt and two slices of pineapple. 'Will that cost £19?' I ask. 'Yes, but she can go back for more.' 'But she doesn't want to.' We ask to see the manager, who, to his credit, accepts the pricing is bizarre and charges us nothing. I produce the plastic glove at checkout and secretly hope the smiley young man will knock something off our bill. He doesn't. We won't return. Mondrian London . 20 Upper Ground . London .

One school-based knife incident an hour was reported to police during the week of school teacher Ann Maguire's death. Mrs Maguire was stabbed  at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds, Yorkshire on April 28. In that same week, 37 separate knife crimes were reported in schools across England, Wales and Scotland according to figures released under the Freedom of Information Act. In West Yorkshire, where Mrs Maguire was killed, there was just one reported incident. However, between 2011 and 2013 there were 21 reported incidents involving weapons across West Yorkshire involving either knives, knuckle dusters and hammers - with the youngest suspect just 11 years old. Seven of those pupils were charged, nine received cautions, five were sent to a restorative justice scheme and two faced no further action. Elsewhere in the week of Mrs Maguire's death, there were 12 reported knife crimes in schools in Greater Manchester,  with four each in Scotland and South Wales. There were three school-based knife crimes in the West Midlands and two in Nottinghamshire. According to the Mirror, in total, 37 similar crimes were reported across the country. West Midlands Police reported 1,190 crimes involving weapons in schools between 2009 and 2013 involving suspects aged between eight and 36.

"A pair of self-proclaimed Scottish aristocrats accused of claiming $167,000 in welfare while living aboard a $1.2million yacht have told a court they are broke. Prosecutors claim Colin Chisholm III, 62, and his wife Lady Andrea, 54, ran a seven-year scam while owning a six-bed lakeside home, a beach property in Florida, a $30,000 Lexus and $3million in undeclared funds. But as they appeared in orange jumpsuits before a court in their home state of Minnesota, their lawyer said he was representing the couple for free and they could not afford bail. Prison jumpsuits: Prosecutors say Andrea and Colin Chisholm, who proclaim themselves to be descended from Scottish aristocrats, cheated the states of Minnesota and Florida out of $167,000 while living on a yacht . Colin Chisolm's attorney Thomas Kelly told prosecutors they were 'not going to see that they were living a luxurious life down there', David Chanen of the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported. Mr Kelly added: 'They are neither trying to avoid police or repaying the money... If they had money, they would settle up.' The attorney said some aspects of the case were agreed but several allegations were in dispute. He said the couple were only in the Bahamas because their business failed, had several conversations about their situation with officials and been co-operative with the authorities. But despite the plea, a judge doubled their bail from $150,000 to $300,000 after prosecutors insisted they had tried to cheat the authorities even while on the run, the Star Tribune reported. 'Scottish aristocrats' Colin Chisholm III and his wife 'Lady' Andrea appeared in jumpsuits in a Florida courtroom earlier this month where they agreed to be extradited to Minnesota to face the allegations . Lady in waiting: Andrea Chisholm is led into the Florida court earlier this month before the short hearing . The Chisholms allegedly collected food . stamps, welfare and Medicaid in Florida and Minnesota over a seven-year period while living a . life of luxury aboard their yacht Andrea Aras. Prosecutors claim they fled Minnesota with their seven-year-old son and . their dog as investigators tightened the net around them. The . couple, who reportedly had nine purebred Cavalier King Charles . spaniels, were held in separate Florida jails before being extradited to . Minnesota two weeks ago. Colin Chisholm had previously refused to speak to authorities and hired an attorney. The . couple claimed to be wealthy . Scottish aristocrats while living in the community of Deephaven, . Minnesota, where authorities pledged last month to do everything in their . power to bring them to justice. 'These were rich folks ripping off the . system,' Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said at a press . conference. 'I will make sure they do hard time.' On the run: Prosecutors claim the couple fled Minnesota with their seven-year-old son and their dog . 'Scottish aristocrats' Colin Chisholm the Third, 62, and his wife Lady Andrea, 54, have been charged with $165,000 in welfare fraud while it is alleged they were living on a $1.2million yacht in Florida . The couple not only owned a $1.2million yacht but also a $30,000 Lexus and beach property in Florida . The maximum sentence is a $100,000 fine and 20 years behind bars. Colin . Chisholm III, claims he is from a long line of Scottish aristocracy and . is a wealthy broadcasting executive, according to court filings. The . couple were allegedly receiving public assistance for their medical care and food . stamps in Minnesota for years while also collecting welfare . in Florida. According to the criminal complaint filed in February, the Chisholms applied for more than a dozen forms of medical assistance, welfare payments and food stamps. Lady Chisholm had her prenatal care for the couple's son in 2006 paid for by the state while claiming to be destitute. Noble roots: According to their company website, the couple trace their roots to Clan Chisholm in Struy . In the welfare applications, the couple allegedly lied about where they were living and who they were living with. Colin Chisholm did not declare that he . ran a business nor Lady Chisholm that she had a dog kennel which breeds . championship-worthy Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. According to the website for their company Strathglass Kennel, the couple trace their roots to the Clan Chisholm from the small village of Struy in the Scottish Highlands. Lady Chisholm is alleged to have claimed for state prenatal care despite having millions of dollars in the bank . Chisholm is listed as the president and CEO of TCN Network, a satellite TV company serving the Carribbean. More than $1 million flowed through accounts he controlled as part of that company, the complaint states. The couple were living with Lady Chisholm's mother in Minneapolis when they first applied for welfare in 2005. However for the next two years, they resided on their Florida yacht, and later at a beach property in the state, none of which was ever declared, investigators claim. In April 2007, the Chisholms came back to Minnesota and filled out forms for more benefits. In March 2008, they moved into a luxury home in Deephaven with Andrea’s grandparents Eloise and Francis Heidecker. Francis died in February 2009 at age 94 and by September of that year, Eloise Heidecker and the Chisholms were evicted from the home. They immediately moved to another Deephaven home on Lake Minnetonka with stunning waterfront views. The home, built in 1909, has six bedrooms, five bathrooms and stretch to 5,800 sq ft set on 1.6 acres, according to property records.

"A rat-infested and toxic Russian cruise ship cast adrift in the Atlantic Ocean has apparently vanished. The MV Lyubov Orlova - named after a Soviet actress - broke free in January when it was being tugged to be scrapped. It was being tracked by US intelligence officials but has not been seen since March and there are fears it has sunk. Sunk without trace: The MV Lyubov Orlova has been missing since January and is now presumed to be at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean . The luxury liner was being towed to the Dominican Republic from Newfoundland, Canada, when it slipped away as the crew on board the towing ship battled howling winds and 10ft . waves to try in vain to reconnect the towing line. The so-called 'ghost ship' was located briefly in February as it floated aimlessly about 500 miles off the coast of Ireland. Then, in March, the Canadian Coast . Guard reported that one of the ship's emergency radio beacons, which . activate after hitting the water or another object, flashed a location . almost 800 miles off Newfoundland, according to the Vancouver Sun. With no further sightings, some are speculating the ship has sunk. There are fears the vessel could be leaking toxic fluids into the . water, according to French environmental organization Robin du Bois. 'In case of a collision or sinking or . any accident, the Lyubov Orlova will immediately release fuel,other . toxic liquids, asbestos, mercury and other non-degradable floating . waste,' the group declared in a statement, according to LiveScience. There has been confusion about which country is responsible for the 37-year-old luxury liner. Destination: The cruise ship disappeared as it was being towed to the Dominican Republic to be scrapped . Off-course: The mysterious ship has been sighted 1,300 nautical miles from Ireland's west coast . Canada's transport authority has said . the abandoned ship is no longer its concern as the vessel has left the . country's waters, with officials insisting the owner of the Orlova is . responsible for its movements. Court records obtained by the Globe and Mail newspaper show the vessel is owned by Hussein Humayuni, the owner of Neptune International Shipping Inc. Now home only to rats, the 1976-built ship once carried passengers on Antarctic cruises. The . ship was seized by authorities in Newfoundland in 2010 amid spiraling . debts owed to charter firm Cruise North Expeditions after faults on . board meant a scheduled cruise had to be cancelled. She is understood to have been sold to Neptune International Shipping in February last year to be broken up. A supply vessel called the Atlantic Hawk was able to reconnect to the Orlova a short time later, only to have the cable fail again. The ghostly liner was not seen again until about a month later, when a was spotted 1,300 nautical miles from Ireland's west coast.","The MV Lyubov Orlova vanished en route to Dominican Republic in January .

We had envisaged waking up to the sound of York Minster’s pealing bells and were sorry when our taxi from the station went through the beautiful city centre, past the famous Gothic cathedral - and then continued out the other side. Although Marmadukes is only half a mile from the city walls, you are either in York or you are not. And instead of bells, at one point we endured chants from the nearby York City football stadium. We arrived at 2pm and needed to dust ourselves down before heading out to meet friends for a birthday lunch - a quick turnaround in other words. A slice of classic British hospitality: Marmadukes Hotel occupies a leafy residential street in York . Unfortunately, the receptionist had other ideas. She told us in no uncertain terms that check-in did not start until 3pm. I pushed it a little because the hotel has 20 rooms and we thought one of them might be available, but she wasn’t budging. In fact, I thought she might send me to the castle dungeons if I asked anything else. But then the manager appeared, a far friendlier no-nonsense Yorkshire woman. Come in, take a seat: The hotel lounge is fitted out with comfortable sofas, wide windows and wooden flooring . She announced that our room was ‘good to go’ and handed us the key. We were on the first floor with a view of a boarding house for nearby St Peter’s school. The high ceilings and large bay window drew in the flinty Yorkshire light; the Victorian-style bed was inviting; there was a wife-pleasing-sized dressing table and spacious wardrobe. No hints of modernity. Americans might call it quaint. Marmadukes markets itself as the former ‘townhouse home of a Victorian gentleman’, which is a touch misleading given that it’s really two suburban red-brick buildings.

"Rating: . 'Sorry, I’m just leaning across you momentarily,' a well-spoken young man says to my wife as he stretches to collect her side plate. We are taken by his turn of phrase and bedside manner. Come to think of it, the girl who showed us to our room had the same sort of polite confidence and plummy inflection. Then there are the paintings of hunting scenes, the tartan carpeting up the stairs and on the landings, the framed hand-written letters. It makes us think that this can only be a toff enterprise staffed by the proprietor’s godchildren and their gap-year friends. A slice of English tradition: The Crown is a classic country pub in a pretty Suffolk pub . To further our inquiries, we ask the leaning-across-you-momentarily waiter for some background. He explains that the Bildeston Crown in Suffolk, about six miles from Lavenham, is owned by James Buckle, who lives in the manor house. He bought the Grade II-listed pub first, and then the building next door, and has turned it into an exemplary restaurant and bar with 12 rooms upstairs. It is a higgledy-piggledy building that stoops precariously over the pavement, with a courtyard at the back, where a few tables are laid for dinner. Our room has plenty of exposed beams, a pretty French boudoir bed, a spacious bathroom. There is a note saying that tea or coffee is available 24 hours a day at no extra cost. Just press zero on the telephone. There is a formal restaurant called Ingrams, but because of a recent change of chef, it is not in operation. Instead, we eat in the brasserie, where we are given three tiny freshly-baked rolls and a tub of unsalted butter. We devour them instantly. The menu offers gastropub staples: chicken Caesar, posh fish and chips, Red Poll rib eye, Chateaubriand. I’m torn between the chicken Kiev and Crown burger, eventually opting for the former, but it’s the burger that turns up. Warm welcome: The pub offers a red-brick interior with exposed beams and leather chairs . The waitress is mortified, but I’m quietly pleased she’s made a mistake - and would have been even more so if the burger hadn’t been quite so rubbery. Towards the end of dinner, we establish that our erudite waiter is only 18. He seems like a proper grown-up to me - but then, this is a grown-up sort of operation. He is not around at breakfast in the morning. In fact, it’s all very quiet, except for some dreadful and entirely unnecessary muzak. The low-ceiling dining room does not feel as inviting as it did the night before, so we ask if the doors to the courtyard can be opened to let in some fresh air. Before leaving, we wander up the high street. Bildeston is a proper working village, with a couple of shops and a post office. The Crown used to be the place where farm labourers and domestic servants were hired. Today, it’s back in business offering sure-footed service with the help of some friendly, articulate staff who can be forgiven for some lapses in concentration.

"What to do for a family holiday when the children have grown too old for Center Parcs? One option is to graduate to Denmark, where the countryside is beautiful - and there are plenty of bicycles to go around. A pedal-powered trip along the ‘Danish Riviera’ - those miles of unspoilt coastline that stretch along the north of Zealand island - is Center Parcs with knobs on. Pedal power: The cycle paths of the Danish Riviera are a fine destination for a family summer holiday . Or, perhaps, being Danish, that should be ‘with knøbs on’. Maybe it is because so many parts of Britain have become wretchedly overpopulated, but it comes as a delightful shock to be in a country where there seem to be so few people. We could cycle for 30 minutes down coastal tracks and forest trails, and not meet a soul. One morning, the only person we see is a man from the local council on a motor-mower, as he prettifies our route. And what a pretty route it is. The upper Zealand coast - from Helsingør in the east (where Kronborg Castle was immortalised by Shakespeare as the home of Hamlet) to the fishing town of Hundested in the west - is utterly gorgeous. Fresh air and wide horizons: The Danish Riviera specialises in quiet beaches and Scandinavian charm . Our family itinerary is a perfect arrangement of self-led routes, tailor-made to be the right length for all ages and abilities - stuffed with sights and food-stop opportunities. Very quickly, we are able to confirm the observation in that waspishly accurate book, A Xenophobe’s Guide To The Danes, that cycling to Denmark is what skiing is to Norwegians and driving is to Germans. Not to ride a bicycle is a sign of eccentricity. During our week, we spend two nights in each of three different seaside hotels, cycling a total of about 150 miles - with all luggage transportation taken care of. Our first stop, after an efficient train journey from Copenhagen airport, is the family-run Hotel Villa Brinkly, overlooking the Oresund - the strip of sea which separates Denmark from Sweden, and is just two miles ‘wide’ at its narrowest. After breakfast, we have a get-to-know-you session with our rental bikes. These come fitted with a handy handlebar map-rest, spanners and puncture-repair kit (only required once). Let's do lunch: The Gordon family halted in Hornbaek for - surprisingly inexpensive - fish and chips . We pedal a few miles down the coast to visit a museum detailing the life of the author Karen Blixen, whose colonial memoir Out Of Africa was turned into a film starring Meryl Streep and Robert Redford. Our second day entails a delightful inland route through woods to the magnificent royal palace of Frederiksborg (‘the Danish Versailles’). After this meandering 26-mile effort, we take the train back to base (the tickets cost 72 krone (£7) each, plus £1.20 per bike) - and set off west the next morning to take in the fishing village of Hornbæk, and miles of empty white-sand beaches. I don’t know why anyone would want to persuade us that this is the ‘Danish St Tropez’ - because nothing could be further removed from that now oligarch-infested French Riviera resort. Apart from the beaches, our route takes us past several freshwater lakes, in which we swim with few other souls in sight. The cliché about Scandinavia is that it is ‘very expensive’. This is not exactly true. Fish and chips at Hornbæk harbour’s Fiskehuset costs a mere £6.40. A palace to be proud of: Frederiksborg has been described - not without reason - as the 'Danish Versailles' Picnics are another treat. A splendid deli called Røgeri in the village of Tikøb even sells guilt-inducing pork scratchings. This leads us to ponder that unsolved conundrum - if the home of Danish bacon has more pigs than people, where on earth are they all? We do not see a single one. We do, however, come across a beautiful Cistercian monastery in Esrum - a religious relic, consecrated in 1151, with a kitchen herb garden. One member of staff is dressed in medieval costume. This sight is capped 15 minutes later when we stop to see if the church in the village of Esbønderup is open. It is. Inside, a young bearded man is sitting at a piano, playing Bach’s Prelude And Fugue from memory. It is hard to sum up the wonder of the region - but a morning visit to the cliff-top home of the Arctic explorer Knud Rasmussen rather encapsulates our trip. This thatched house is now a museum with heart-stirring views out to sea. Like many small places, it only accepts cash or Danish credit cards. Short of krone for the (£5) entrance fee, we cannot go in. But the couple on reception do not want us to be disappointed and let us in for free - then give us a personal guided tour. Two wheels good: Helsingor, one of the key towns on Zealand island, is a lovely place to pause . Our last two days are based at the Helenekilde Badehotel in the seaside village of Tisvildeleje - a soothing reward after a week’s cycling. We flabbergast the locals by going for a pre-breakfast swim. ‘I thought we were supposed to be Vikings - not you wimpy Brits’ one says. The word ‘Viking’ comes from the Old Norse, and refers to ‘an expedition overseas’.

"Ice in Greenland is melting partly because of heat from the Earth's mantle, according to a team of international researchers. The group claims that they are the first to find a connection between melting of the Greenland ice sheet and the high heat flow from the Earth’s mantle. The findings, they suggest, could have implications for future predictions on climate change and the reasons behind ice melt in the region. In total, the Greeland ice sheet contains an amount of ice that would lead to a rise of global sea level by more than seven metres, if completely melted . The Greenland ice sheet is often considered an important contributor to future global sea-level rise over the next century or longer. In total, it contains an amount of ice that would lead to a rise of global sea level by more than seven metres, if completely melted. The ice loss from the ice sheet has been increasing over the last decade, with half of it attributed to changes in surface conditions with the remainder due to increased iceberg calving - the process by which ice detaches from the glacier to become an iceberg. The international research initiative IceGeoHeat, led by the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, said that the effect of the Earth's crust and upper mantle in current climate modelling are too simplistic. They modelled the Earth’s mantle against . the ice sheet and found that melting occurs in a given area due to the . composition of the mantle underneath it. The team modelled the Earth's mantle against the ice sheet and found that melting occurs in a given area due to the composition of the mantle underneath it . Writing in the current online issue of Nature Geoscience, the group argues that this effect cannot be neglected when putting together data on climate change. The Greenland ice sheet loses about 227 gigatonnes of ice per year and contributes about 0.7 millimeters to the currently observed mean sea level change of about 3 mm per year. The team point out, however, that existing model calculations were based on a consideration of the ice cap. GFZ scientists Alexey Petrunin and Irina Rogozhina have now combined earlier ice and climate models with their new thermo-mechanical model for the Greenland lithosphere. ‘We have run the model over a simulated period of three million years, and taken into account measurements from ice cores and independent magnetic and seismic data’, said Petrunin. The researchers believe that the coupling of models of ice dynamics with thermo-mechanical models of the solid earth allows a more accurate view of the processes that are melting the Greenland ice . ‘The temperature at the base of the ice, and therefore the current dynamics of the Greenland ice sheet is the result of the interaction between the heat flow from the earth's interior and the temperature changes associated with glacial cycles,’ said Irina Rogozhina who initiated IceGeoHeat. ‘We found areas where the ice melts at the base next to other areas where the base is extremely cold.’ The current climate is influenced by processes that go far back into the history of Earth: the Greenland lithosphere is 2.8 to 1.7 billion years old and is only about 70 to 80 km thick under Central Greenland. The researchers believe that the coupling of models of ice dynamics with thermo-mechanical models of the solid earth allows a more accurate view of the processes that are melting the Greenland ice. We could refreeze the Arctic, and it wouldn't even cost that much, a scientist claims. Two published studies explore the possibility that a technological solution could be found to the problem of global warming melting the ice caps on the North Pole. The scientist who is lead author on both claims that 'any significant nation' could find the resources to carry out the operation. The only significant question, he says, is whether we should. David Keith, professor of applied physics at Harvard University, is lead author on papers published in Nature Climate Change and Environmental Research Letters which speculate as to how we could restore the polar ice. He used climate models to suggest injecting reflective particles into the atmosphere could reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth, engineering a regional effect that could bring ice back to the Arctic. His paper claims that by reducing the penetration of sunlight by just 0.5 per cent is could be possible to restore the sea-ice around the North Pole back to pre-industrial era levels. His second paper suggests the whole operation could be accomplished with just a few modified Gulfstream jets, costing somewhere in the region of $8billion a year. However, while he believes action must be taken to tackle the amount of pollution spewed into the Earth's atmosphere, he doesn't yet advocate the kind of action his papers suggest .","Study suggests melting in an area is due to composition of Earth's mantle .
The IceGeoHeat team claims they produced more accurate forecasts by adding their new findings to earlier models on climate change ."
"Passengers who were hit by a vomiting bug that ‘ruined’ their eight-day cruise to Norway are taking legal action against Fred Olsen Cruise Lines. The luxury voyage to the Norwegian Fjords had to be cut short after the stomach virus – believed to be norovirus – left hundreds of guests suffering from symptoms of a gastroenteritis-type illness on board the Balmoral. Martin D’Arcy, one of the passengers who has contacted lawyers, claims he was confined to his cabin with diarrhoea, stomach cramps and fever. Passengers said their voyage to the Norwegian Fjords on board the Balmoral (pictured) was 'ruined' Martin D’Arcy, 66, said he was so ill that he was confined to his cabin for half of the journey . Mr D’Arcy, from Dorset, said he continues to suffer as a result of the illness. The 66-year-old retired sales service engineer said: ‘The illness just completely ruined our holiday – I was hoping to see so many sights but my illness meant that I had to cancel excursions and I spent half of the trip quarantined in my cabin. ‘This has affected more than just our holiday, as I am still struggling with illness symptoms now which are preventing me from getting on with my day-to-day life. ‘I am extremely frustrated by what I have been through and feel that I deserve answers as to why what was supposed to be a relaxing cruise, was completely turned upside down by illness.’ The outbreak was so bad the luxury voyage to the Norwegian Fjords had to be cut short by a day . Retired engineer John Trownson, 86, described the experience as ‘dreadful’ and estimated ‘more than 300 people’ fell ill. The outbreak on the ship – which was carrying 1,163 passengers, all paying between £799 and £1,649 per person – was so bad that it returned to its home port a day early to be ‘systematically sanitised’ ahead of its next trip, a 13-night cruise from the Portuguese island of Madeira. It is not the first time Fred Olsen cruise passengers have been hit by gastric illnesses. Between October 2009 and May 2010, 130 passengers fell ill on its cruise liner Boudicca, a sister ship of that involved in the latest incident. In 2014, the company paid out £280,000 compensation to those affected. In March and April 2011, 12 passengers sailing around the Mediterranean became ill, again on Boudicca, with some later given £10,000 payouts. Then in 2013, the company reported an outbreak of 'a gastroenteritis-type illness' on Boudicca after it left Belfast for a 10-night 'Scandinavian Cities Cruise'. In that case, 72 passengers were affected. Fred Olsen has  said all its ships meet the highest standards of health, safety and hygiene at all times. Irwin Mitchell claims it has been contacted by multiple passengers, including Mr D'Arcy, who went on the cruise, which began on May 3 in Southampton. A Fred Olsen Cruise Lines spokeswoman claimed Mr D’Arcy reported his symptoms to staff 11 hours after they surfaced, ‘during which time it was likely that he was able to spread the illness to others’. The spokeswoman added: ‘Fred Olsen Cruise Lines stresses to all guests the importance of making staff aware of any illness as a matter of urgency, in order to enable the most effective containment measures on board. ‘Sadly, Mr D’Arcy did not do so and we were therefore not aware that he had become ill until much later.’ Nathan Philpot, Fred Olsen Cruise Lines’ sales and marketing director, told MailOnline Travel: ‘We are sorry that Mr D’Arcy’s cruise was impacted by what appears to be norovirus. ‘Investigations into the outbreak are ongoing, but it appears that – almost certainly – the illness was spread by one guest, as the single source, whilst waiting at the Southampton Cruise Terminal. ‘Norovirus is highly contagious, more so than the common cold, and could easily have been passed on at this time, meaning that more than one person may have boarded the ship with the illness; they were, most probably, unaware that they had picked up norovirus. 'Fred Olsen Cruise Lines issues pre-screening health questionnaires at the time of boarding, which need to be signed by all guests to confirm that they are not suffering from any illness, and no guest declared any symptoms at this time.' Irwin Mitchell said it has launched an investigation into the source of the passengers’ symptoms. Amandeep Dhillon, a partner at Irwin Mitchell, said: ‘We are very concerned by these reports and have already been contacted for help by passengers affected by the reported illness problems on board the Balmoral cruise ship. ‘Whilst it is welcome that steps have been taken to deep clean the ship ahead of its next voyage, all of those on board the vessel during this outbreak will be keen to understand how the illness problems developed. The luxury cruise ship (pictured) had nurses going between cabins handing out tablets to the sick . ‘Anyone heading on a cruise expects a relaxing break, yet we see time and time again how illness on such vessels cannot only affect people’s holidays but also go on to leave them with long lasting health issues. ‘After being contacted by those affected, we have now commenced our own investigations in an effort to help the passengers obtain the answers they are searching for.’ Mr Philpot said Fred Olsen Cruise Lines is ‘pretty certain’ the illness was brought onto the ship as the first case was reported within hours of the ship’s departure from Southampton, and it takes 12 to 48 hours for norovirus symptoms to appear. He added: ‘Otherwise symptoms would have become evident later, as they did on day two and three of the cruise – which is further evidence that it was brought onto the ship on embarkation day and passed onto other guests. ‘Additionally, we know that the ship had no cases of norovirus on its previous cruise, from Egypt to Southampton.’ Fred Olsen is offering passengers vouchers for up to 50 per cent off a future voyage to the Norwegian Fjords . Passengers have been offered a refund covering one day's cost and a voucher for up to 50 per cent off a future voyage. Additional out-of-pocket expenses would be dealt with ‘on a case-by-case basis’, a spokesperson said previously. Passengers Rus and Marina Donaldson, both 55, previously said they would never go on a cruise with any company again after falling ill on board the Balmoral. Mr Donaldson added: ‘We wouldn't risk the possibility of repeating this experience. Even if they paid us we wouldn't go on it.' Fred Olsen has declined to reveal the number of passengers afflicted by the bug, saying ‘a number of the guests on board’ were affected.","Passengers said their  cruise to the Norwegian Fjords was 'ruined'

"Arizona has become the first state in America to pass legislation allowing people and businesses to refuse to work with or serve gays if their religion forbids or disapproves of homosexuality. The Democrat opposition called the proposal 'state-sanctioned discrimination' and an embarrassment and claimed that it would hurt the economy. 'This bill is about going after the . rights of the LGBT community in Arizona,' said Representative Chad . Campbell, the leader of the Democrat opposition. 'This is going to be horrible . for our economy.' Arizona House Minority Leader Chad Campbell (with microphone) says that a new bill would discriminate against gays and others. The legislation is designed to allow people and businesses to refuse to serve or work with gays if they find homosexuality against their religious beliefs . If accepted, the bill will put the state back into the forefront . of controversial law debate, four years after the national uproar it caused with an . immigration crackdown. Other states - Ohio, Mississippi, Idaho, South . Dakota, Tennessee and Oklahoma - have brought in religious legislation but Arizona is the only one to pass. Republicans claim the bill is about protecting religious freedom and not discrimination, They mentioned the case of a New Mexico photographer who was sued after refusing to take wedding pictures of a gay couple. In favour: Republican Justin Pierce spoke in favour of the legislation that Democrats said was 'discriminatory' The bill allows any business, church or person to use the law as a defence in any action brought by the government or individual claiming discrimination. The bill is backed by the Center for Arizona Policy, a social conservative group that opposes abortion and gay marriage. The group says the proposal is needed to protect against increasingly activist federal courts and simply clarifies existing state law. All but three Republicans in the House voted in favour of the bill. and the Senate passed it the day before. In 2008, Arizona voted to ban same-sex marriage but there is no guarantee that the bill will pass as Republican Governor Jan Brewer vetoed a similar measure last year. Republicans said it was simply an added protection for the faithful in the state who disapprove of gay marriage and want to be able to reject participating.","Legislation dismissed as 'state-sanctioned discrimination'

"Astronomers are closer than ever to solving one of the universe's greatest mysteries. The hunt for dark matter has taken another step forward thanks to new supercomputer simulations showing how our 'local universe' grew from the Big Bang 13.798 billion years ago, to the present day. Physicists claim their simulations show that 'halos' of matter that formed as the universe developed could be evidence of the elusive substance. The new simulation could reveal how galaxies and dark matter formed in the early universe. Here, gas in the Eagle Simulation shows hot bubbles (red colours) surrounding large galaxies, connected by colder filaments (blue and green colours). The insets show the distribution of gas, stars and dark matter . Scientists believe that these clumps of dark matter, or halos, that emerged from the early universe trapped intergalactic gas and became the birthplaces of galaxies. Dark matter accounts for around 85 per cent of the universe. It surrounds galaxies across the universe, and is invisible because it does not reflect light. It cannot be seen directly with telescopes, but astronomers know it to be out there because of the gravitational effects it has on the matter we can see. A dark matter halo is the hypothetical region that surrounds a galaxy. It is thought to extend well beyond the visible edge of the galaxy and dominates the total mass of the galaxy. However, since they cannot be observed directly their existence is only a theory. Nonetheless its believed that many galaxies were born in such halos - but why there are only a few in our vicinity is a mystery. According to Durham University's simulation the explanation could be that only those halos that grew fast enough after the Big Bang were able to eventually form galaxies. Cosmological theory predicts that our own cosmic neighbourhood should be teeming with millions of small halos containing galaxies, but only a few dozen such small galaxies have been observed around the Milky Way. 'I've . been losing sleep over this for the last 30 years,' said Professor Carlos Frenk, Director of Durham University's Institute for Computational Cosmology. 'Dark . matter is the key to everything we know about galaxies, but we still . don't know its exact nature. 'Understanding how galaxies formed holds the . key to the dark matter mystery.' One of the biggest mysteries is why there isn't a galaxy in every halo. The Durham researchers believe their simulations answer this question, showing explicitly how and why millions of halos around our galaxy and neighbouring Andromeda failed to produce galaxies and became barren. They say the gas that would have made the galaxy was sterilised by the heat from the first stars that formed in the universe, and was prevented from cooling and turning into stars. However, a few halos managed to bypass this cosmic furnace by growing early and fast enough to hold on to their gas and eventually form galaxies. In this animation, a flight through 13 billion years of cosmic history takes us to 'our' Local Group in the Eagle simulation. The change in colours indicates how stars heat up the intergalactic gas to high temperatures (credit: Richard Bower, Durham University) The simulation is hoped to solve the mystery as to why there isn't a galaxy in every dark matter halo. Here the visible galaxies in the Local Group simulation, shown in the lower right, only trace a tiny fraction of the vast number of dark matter halos, revealed in the upper left . The findings, presented at the Royal Astronomical Society's National Astronomy Meeting in Portsmouth, were funded by the UK's Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) and the European Research Council. A recent Massachusetts-led researchers said they may have found the first hints of dark matter particles. Using two observatories they found an unidentified spike of X-ray intensity in a galaxy cluster 240 million light-years away. The signal could be the sign of the decay of 'sterile neutrinos', one of the proposed particles that dark matter is made of. However, the researchers claim the dark matter explanation is a 'long shot'. 'We have learned that most dark matter halos are quite different from the ""chosen few"" that are lit up by starlight,' Professor Frenk continued, referring to some that contain stars and some that do not. 'Thanks to our simulations we know that if our theories of dark matter are correct then the universe around us should be full of halos that failed to make a galaxy. 'Perhaps astronomers will one day figure out a way to find them.' Lead researcher Dr Till Sawala, in the Institute for Computational Cosmology, at Durham University, said the research was the first to simulate the evolution of our 'Local Group' of galaxies. This is a group of more than 54 galaxies that includes Andromeda and the Milky Way. 'What we've seen in our simulations is a cosmic own goal,' said Dr Sawala. 'We already knew that the first generation of stars emitted intense radiation, heating intergalactic gas to temperatures hotter than the surface of the sun. 'After that, the gas is so hot that further star formation gets a lot more difficult, leaving halos with little chance to form galaxies. 'We were able to show that the cosmic heating was not simply a lottery with a few lucky winners. 'Instead, it was a rigorous selection process and only halos that grew fast enough were fit for galaxy formation.' The findings by the researchers were funded by the UK's Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) and the European Research Council. The team used the DiRAC Cosmology Machine, pictured, to create the simulation. It has 6720 Intel Xeon Cores and 53,760 gigabytes of ram . The close-up look at the Local Group is part of the larger Eagle project currently being undertaken by cosmologists at Durham University and the University of Leiden in the Netherlands. Eagle is one of the first attempts to simulate what happened from the Big Bang to the present day in the formation of galaxies in the universe. By peering into the virtual universe, the researchers find galaxies that look remarkably like our own, surrounded by countless dark matter halos, only a small fraction of which contain galaxies. The Durham-led simulation was carried out on the 'Cosmology Machine', which is the part of the DiRAC national supercomputing facility for research in astrophysics and particle physics funded by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills through the STFC. The Cosmology Machine - based at Durham University - has more than 5,000 times the computing power of typical PCs, and over 10,000 times the amount of memory.","Durham University scientists say they've solved a mystery of dark matter .

"A mysterious ‘magic island’ has appeared out of nowhere in radar images of a sea on Saturn's giant moon, Titan. Scientists are struggling to explain the bright ‘transient feature’ but say it could be the result of waves, bubbles or buoyant solid matter. The object was spotted by flipping between images of Ligeia Mare, Titan's second-largest sea, captured by the Cassini space probe which has been exploring the Saturnian system since 2004. Scroll down for video . As it was: A 2007 image of the area of the transient feature in Titan's sea Ligeia Mare before it was discovered . Now: A photo from July 2013 of the mysterious 'magic island' transient feature in Ligeia Mare (circled in red), acquired by the Cassini probe . Prior to July 2013 the hydrocarbon sea had appeared flat and completely devoid of features, including waves. Then the enigmatic object, dubbed ‘magic island’ by scientists, suddenly materialised - only to vanish away in later images. Planetary scientist Jason Hofgartner, from Cornell University in New York City, said: ‘This discovery tells us that the liquids in Titan's northern hemisphere are not simply stagnant and unchanging, but rather that changes do occur. ‘We don't know precisely what caused this 'magic island' to appear, but we'd like to study it further.’ Titan is the only planetary body in the Solar System besides Earth known to have large expanses of liquid on its surface. Perspective: A wider Nasa photograph of Titan's north polar sea Ligeia Mare, captured by the Cassini probe . Comparison: Titan has weather systems similar to those of watery Earth, with wind and rain carving out strikingly familiar landscapes . But unlike on Earth, they do not consist of water. Titan's seas, the size of Earth's Great Lakes, are formed by flowing rivers of liquid methane and ethane. Essentially, they are made from lighter fuel. With . its thick atmosphere and organic-rich chemistry, Titan resembles a . frozen version of Earth several billion years ago, before life began . pumping oxygen into our atmosphere. Because . Titan is smaller than Earth, its gravity doesn’t hold onto its . gaseous envelope as tightly, so the atmosphere extends 370 miles into space. As on . Earth, the climate is driven mostly by changes in the amount of sunlight . that come with the seasons, although the seasons on Titan are about . seven Earth years long. Titan's ‘water’ is liquid methane, CH4, . better known on Earth as natural gas. Regular Earth-water, H2O, would be . frozen solid on Titan where the surface temperature is -180°C. With . Titan's low gravity and dense atmosphere, methane raindrops could grow . twice as large as Earth's raindrops. As well as this, they would fall . more slowly, drifting down like snowflakes. Scientists think it rains . perhaps only every few decades. Beneath Titan's thick, hazy atmosphere, scientists have also discovered icy mountains and dunes made from organic ‘sand’. Titan has weather systems similar to those of watery Earth, with wind and rain carving out strikingly familiar landscapes. Huygens, a European Space Agency probe deployed from Cassini, landed on Titan in January 2005 - the first spacecraft landing ever accomplished in the outer Solar System. The craft touched down on a flat, damp, sandy plain covered with ice pebbles. Details of the ‘magic island’ discovery are published in the journal Nature Geoscience. Astronomers think the strange feature may arise from changing seasons. The main theories are winds kicking up and forming waves, pictured as a kind of ‘ghost’ island in the radar images, bubbles formed by gases pushing out from the sea floor, and floating or suspended solids. ‘Likely, several different processes - such as wind, rain and tides - might affect the methane and ethane lakes on Titan,’ said Mr Hofgartner. ‘We want to see the similarities and differences from geological processes that occur here on Earth. Ultimately, it will help us to understand better our own liquid environments.’","Scientists say it could be result of waves, bubbles or buoyant solid matter .

"The season isn’t over yet, though the summer may well be. Which is why it feels like an appropriate moment to hand out 10 gongs for events that will linger in the memory – and others that may have been instantly forgotten. Ladies and gents, we give you the Top Spins... The Ravi Shastri rosette for aptest cliche . Cricket is a game of inches. If Sri Lankan No 11 Nuwan Pradeep had not edged the penultimate ball of the Lord’s Test into his pads, or the final ball just in front of Chris Jordan in the slips; if Shaminda Eranga’s penultimate-ball bouncer to Jimmy Anderson at Headingley had cannoned off his arm-guard rather than his glove – if both these things had happened, England would have kicked off the Test summer with a 1-0 win rather than a 1-0 defeat. But they didn’t. Two tiny quirks of fate meant Alastair Cook was under pressure again sooner than anyone thought he would be. Under pressure: A sombre-looking Alastair Cook after the surprise series defeat by Sri Lanka . The Joey Barton big-up for lashing out . In his autobiography Ricky Ponting reflects on ‘being in the zone’. Glenn McGrath bowled better, Ponting reckoned, when he wasn’t sledging: ‘If he started to chat to the batsmen, I knew it might be time to give him a spell.’ Shane Warne was different: ‘The more he spoke, the more the batsmen seemed to fall into his trap. That was when Warnie was in the zone.’ Just before the Headingley Test, Cook responded with uncharacteristic prickliness to a question about Warne’s incessant commentary-box goading. ‘Something needs to be done,’ he said, probably realising as he said it that nothing, in fact, could be done at all. And yet who can honestly say they wouldn’t have reacted as Cook did? Inadvisable it may have been, but it was also endearingly human. The George Orwell goblet for mystery jargon . MS Dhoni’s repeated insistence that ‘processes’ matter more than ‘results’ seemed designed to infuriate Indian fans – and possibly to defend his ever-more indefensible record as Test captain. Yet no one could be quite sure what these processes were, unless they involved capitulation at the first sign of pace and bounce, swing and seam. In which case, we take it all back. The Norman Tebbit trophy for English conservatism . Not long after Jos Buttler had smashed 121 off 74 balls in a one-dayer against Sri Lanka at Lord’s, confirming he was the most exciting England batsman since Kevin Pietersen’s debut a decade ago, Cook declared he was not ready for Test cricket. Peter Moores backtracked the following day, but the damage had been done. The timing was impeccable. Not only was Cook regarded by many as part of a grey cabal responsible for axing Pietersen, he was now fuelling the suspicion that he lacked the courage of whatever convictions are needed to captain your country. The same goes for Alex Hales’s absurdly belated ascent to the 50-over side. The selectors corrected themselves when Matt Prior disappeared for surgery, but English cricket is still learning to trust the world beyond the textbook. Exciting: Jos Buttler smashes Sri Lanka all around Lord's - but his Test debut was delayed . The Dogberry certificate for odorous comparisons . As the Test series began against India, the most depressing of all England’s crises appeared to be the impossibility of replacing Graeme Swann. By the time the series was over, we were wondering what all the fuss was about. In four home Tests against India back in 2011, Swann had managed 13 wickets at 40 apiece; in the four in which he bowled this summer, Moeen Ali could boast 19 at 23. This didn’t suddenly make Moeen a frontliner (his first-class wickets have cost nearly 39 each). But he looked equally adept bowling to right-handers as he did to lefties – something Swann could not always claim. And when his batting returns to the heights of Headingley, England will have an attack-balancing all-rounder on their hands. All-round hero: Moeen Ali proved surprisingly adept as a Test-class spinner this summer . The Anthony Burgess blue-ribbon for double-agentry . For more cricket-related snippets, feel free to go to twitter.com/the_topspin . There is a case – if a mischievous one – for making Ravindra Jadeja England’s player of the series. Not only did his set-to with Anderson persuade Dhoni to pursue a charge that was as doomed as it was counter-productive, but his dropping of Cook on 15 in the first session at Southampton was the fulcrum on which the entire summer turned. Eventually, Jadeja was dropped himself, having taken to charging Anderson in a headless bid to deal with late inswing and been exposed for what he is: an athletic and capable limited-overs cricketer who has been encouraged to believe his own hype. Quite what the more substantial Ravichandran Ashwin made of it all is the stuff of caption competitions. The Mount Everest medallion for solid rocks . After Swann, the player England feared they would miss most was Jonathan Trott, the No 3 who for five years had absorbed the worst that bowlers could hurl at him and laid out the red carpet for the middle order. Yet Gary Ballance had already demonstrated at Sydney that he was more likely than the two other debutants there – Scott Borthwick and Boyd Rankin – to cut the mustard. Much-needed balance: Gary Ballance has made sure Jonathan Trott is not missed at No 3 . In 11 Test innings – one of them unbeaten – Ballance managed 704 runs at 70, scored three hundreds and three fifties, and emitted such unflappability (even, somehow, while falling first ball on the grim fourth evening at Headingley) that Trott could happily be left to his own devices back at Warwickshire. He even had the good sense to treat the coverage of his big night out in Nottingham with a smile and a spot of self-deprecation. The James Callaghan cookie for best crisis (what crisis?) Cook looked out of his depth at Headingley and deluded at Lord’s. He was in the grip of a double whammy that had accounted for so many of his predecessors: no runs and no wins. Who knows how different his world would look now if Jadeja had clung on at the Ageas Bowl. But Cook is stubborn. The next four innings brought him three scores of 70-plus, one of them not out. His senior bowlers woke up. Ian Bell came to life. India retreated shellwards. Three wins do not a Mike Brearley make. But many of us – this column included – were calling for his head, and he refused to serve it up. Hats off. All smiles: Cook's demeanour is in stark contrast to earlier in the summer as England beat India . Gwyneth Paltrow prize for most lachrymose acceptance speech . One or two interpreted Anderson’s tears on the Headingley podium as evidence of a fractured dressing-room. This was curious given that England had just come within two balls of being the first side to bat through the final day of a Test after beginning it five wickets down. If anything, his upset hinted at a unity that had been missing in Australia. How much did Anderson want the new regime to succeed? A tally of 37 wickets – his best in any summer – at 20 each suggested he was probably up for it. From tears to cheers: James Anderson was distraught after defeat by Sri Lanka at Headingley but the led England's fightback as they clinched a much-needed series victory against India .

"Supporters somehow escaped major harm in frightening scenes as a rally car flipped during a race in Italy.

One spectator was said to have been taken to hospital with shock, while the race itself was stopped immediately on the same day as Formula One's Jules Bianchi was fighting for his life after the Japanese Grand Prix. ‘The pilot and co-pilot are well, we have heard a little while ago,’ said race organiser Maurizio Salice. Scavone appeared to take a corner too quickly on the first afternoon of a three-day event and lost control just 800ft from the end of the track in the Aosta Valley – one hour north of Turin. The vehicle was captured encroaching on a grass verge, a vantage point of choice for a number of fans. They had to take swift decisive action, but the fact that nobody on the wall was injured remains fortuitous in the extreme. One woman can be seen attempting to shield herself from the flying debris as the car tumbled back into the middle of the track. Thankfully, the car missed all spectators, and even the driver and his navigator were unharmed, despite how the car looked after the crash .

"Scott Quigg faces former world champion Paulus Ambunda on September 13 at the Phones 4 U Arena in Manchester in what I believe will be the toughest fight of his career. Ambunda won the WBO bantamweight title in 2013 before losing to the hugely talented Tomoki Kameda in the only loss of his career. I give Ambunda plenty of credit for taking this fight - it’s been a hard task matching Quigg. His devastating knockout of Tshifhiwa Munyai in his last fight has made many in the division much less forthcoming. Scott asked for the Leo Santa Cruz unification but they simply don’t fancy the fight - we even offered to come to the US and again he was avoided. Time to shine: Scott Quigg will face Paulus Ambunda in Manchester in September . As Scott continues to send big statements to the vision, we now hope Belfast’s Carl Frampton can beat Kiko Martinez in September and then we can finally give the public the fight they want to see. It is one of the biggest fights out there and we want to make it. Taking the division by storm: Quigg has proved a force to be reckoned with in the bantamweight division . Also on the Manchester bill, Anthony Crolla continues his impressive march in the lightweight division when he challenges former word champion Gamaliel Diaz and unbeaten star Scotty Cardle faces Sunderland’s Kirk Goodings with the winner becoming the mandatory challenger for Terry Flanagan’s British lightweight title. On the bill: Anthony Crolla will fight on the undercard of the . Manchester’s Denton Vassell returns in an expected barn burner against Sam Eggington and heavyweight sensation Anthony Joshua will now make his Manchester debut after his Dublin fight was postponed. I'm continuing talks with Bob Arum over a fight between Carl Froch and Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr on January 24 in Las Vegas. I wish I had more to say but it's going slowly. We still have the same options of Chavez, James DeGale and Mikkel Kessler. Let's wait and see. I watched the boxing at the Commonwealth Games very closely, with one eye on who might make a good professional signing. It was nice to see Antony Fowler, my pre-tournament tip, win the gold – he was brilliant. Golden moment: Antony Fowler celebrates winning gold at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . He was like a little Carl Froch in there, trading away with true grit at times. He’s confident and has talent. I was impressed, as I was by Paddy Barnes, Joe Joyce, Michael Conlan, Josh Taylor and Joe Fitzpatrick. There is some great talent coming through. Impressive: Hearn tipped Fowler for glory before the games . What all of them must now decide is whether to stick or twist. All of them will want to win titles as a professional, but the lure of a gold medal in the Rio Olympics is always there. That is a massive appeal for any amateur. The gamble for them would be to wait instead of switching now when their profile is high. I can reveal here that Ricky Burns’ proposed comeback fight in Manchester on September 13 has been moved because of an elbow injury he picked up against Dejan Zlaticanin. He will now fight on October 4 in Leeds, on a bill including Josh Warrington and Callum Smith. Brian Rose will also make his comeback after his light-middleweight world title challenge in June. Kell Brook has been in Las Vegas for a week as he prepares for his world title shot at Shawn Porter on August 16. He has adjusted well to the time difference and is training hard. He sounds so confident every time I talk to him. He is looking sensational in sparring and I can’t wait to get out there next week and enjoy the build up to this huge fight. Fighting fit: Kell Brook is in Las Vegas preparing for his World Title fight with Shawn Porter . There has been some noise made about the drug testing arrangements after the fight date was changed and I can confirm that both fighters have now been tested and will be again in the future. I think it’s an extremely important part of our sport that needs close attention. Chance to shine: Callum Smith will fight on the Kell Brook undercard . On Brook’s card, I am also using Callum Smith and Luke Campbell, one of our 2012 gold medallists. They have been standout fights for me in the past year. Luke is fighting again after his short break from the sport for family reasons, while Callum does no wrong at the moment. He is such an enormous talent and is heading for a title shot in the next year to 18 months. They will fight six-rounders and both will be benefit from the experience and exposure. I will be talking with Nathan Cleverly this week to try to iron out some more details about his rematch with Tony Bellew. The two dates under consideration are still November 1 in Manchester or November 29 in Liverpool. Rematch: . At Matchroom Boxing we have just launched Fight Pass, which we’re very excited about. I’ve teamed up with Dave Coldwell, Steve Wood and Steve Goodwin, who are all respected UK promoters, and we are now streaming live coverage online of 10 additional fight nights a year.

"HuffPost Live vide host Marc Lamont Hill is no stranger to controversy, but Twitter still erupted Wednesday when he blasted out admiring messages to Mumia Abu-Jamal, a Pennsylvania convict who murdered a Philadelphia police officer in 1981 in cold blood. 'Happy Birthday to my Brother @MumiaAbuJamal,' he wrote. 'So grateful to know him, write with him,and struggle for his release from unjust incarceration.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Bosom buddies: Columbia Teachers College associate professor and HuffPost Live host Marc Lamont Hill (L) tweeted praise for cop-killer Mumia Abu-Jamal (R) on his 59th birthday . Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner died in 1981 when Mumia Abu-Jamal fired five bullets at him from a .38 caliber revolver that police found next to him. He was sentenced to death for first-degree murder, but a federal appeals court later reduced that sentence to life in prison . Abu-Jamal, born Wesley Cook, has a Twitter account. And the legal right, granted by a court, to write books for profit. Hill, also an associate professor at Columbia University's Teachers College, co-authored one of those books with him in 2011. 'Mumia stands as one of the most important voices of his generation,' he wrote in a second tweet, 'one of the leading intellectuals, and reminder that unfreedom lingers.' Angry tweeters, including a few notable names, responded. Abu-Jamal's death sentence made him the international face of U.S. capital punishment, with liberal celebrities praising the killer and at least four foreign heads of state naming streets after him in protest . CBS Sports host John Kincade tweeted, 'don't forget MURDERER on that resume.' And Neal Boortz, a National Radio Hall of Fame broadcaster, chimed in. 'Mumia Yabba Dabba Abu Jamal is no more an intellectual than a turd is a flower arrangement,' he wrote. Boortz retired in January after 42 years of radio, and now publishes a daily podcast. His longtime tagline is 'Somebody's gotta say it!' Undeterred, Hill, fired two more rounds out of his persuasion-gun. 'Mumia represents a cadre of prison intellectuals, who have articulate [sic] dangerous ideas from the dungeons of American prisons,' he insisted in another tweet. 'He also represents a murderer who took a good man from his wife and child,' retorted a conservative blogger, 'but Yay Killer.' Before shifting gears to tweet about basketball, Hill offered one more shot. 'I stand with Mumia and fight for his freedom because I believe in his innocence,' he tweeted. 'I have no doubt that he is a political prisoner.' Derek Hunter, a talk show host on WBAL Radio in Baltimore, offered his own version of this Twitter message -- corrected, he implied, to make it more honest. 'Fixed,' Hunter snarked, with an 'MT' for his modified tweet: 'I stand with Mumia and fight for his freedom because I don't care he shot a cop in the face, he's progressive!' April 24 marked Abu-Jamal's birthday, an annual occasion for 'Free Mumia' rallies on college campuses and in urban city centers. Abu-Jamal was originally sentenced to death for the murder of policeman Daniel Faulkner, but after 30 years on death row and the Supreme Court's refusal to overturn his conviction, a lower appeals court ruled that the jury was improperly instructed. In 2011 his death sentence was commuted to life in prison. At trial, the evidence against Abu-Jamal included a .38 caliber revolver found next to him containing five spent cartridges, a shoulder holster he was wearing which fit the gun, bullet fragments in Faulkner's body that were consistent with that firearm, a bullet wound in his own body from Faulkner's service revolver, and three witnesses who saw the murder firsthand. A hospital security guard and a Philadelphia police officer also testified that Abu-Jamal offered a spoken confession at the hospital where his wound was treated. 'I shot the motherf--ker,' he said, according to those witnesses, 'and I hope the motherf--ker dies.' The annual 'Free Mumia' rally in Philadelphia focused in 2013 on criticizing the local District Attorney's office for maintaining its position that Abu-Jamal, seen here in 1994, killed a policeman in cold blood . Then working part-time as a cab driver, Abu-Jamal had parked his taxi across the street from where Faulkner was conducting a traffic stop of his younger brother's car. The court record shows that he crossed the street and emptied his gun into the officer. Abu-Jamal, a co-founder of the Philadelphia chapter of the Black Panther Party, has become a socialist folk hero during his more than 30 years behind bars, recording audio messages every week for his supporters. Upon the death of Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez, he praised the late dictator. 'For millions of Latin Americans,' according to Abu-Jamal, 'Chavez brought dignity to them by refusing to play the puppet for ""El Norte,"" the U.S. empire. ... Viva Hugo Chavez!' In 2013 the NAACP ran an online promotion to ask members to nominate their favorite 'Unsung Heroes of Black History.' Three members nominated Abu-Jamal. The organization has allowed those tributes to stand . His essays have been published by the Yale Law Journal. National Public Radio offered in 1994 to air three-minute commentaries from him once every month, but canceled the invitation after then-Senator Bob Dole of Kansas joined with the Fraternal Order of Police to publicly condemn the arrangement. When Addison-Wesley, the educational published, agreed to publish Abu-Jamal's death row memoir in 1995, Daniel Faulkner's widow hired a message-towing airplane to fly over the company's headquarters with a banner that read, 'Addison-Wesley Supports a Cop Killer.' In addition to his weekly audio commentaries on Prison Radio, Abu-Jamal writes regular columns for a Marxist magazine in Germany. The Daily Caller reported that in an online promotion called '2013 Unsung Heroes of Black History,' the NAACP let stand three members' nominations of Abu-Jamal as their unsung heroes. In 2011 after the release of a documentary movie that argued for his innocence, Fox News host Greg Gutfeld unleashed a scathing 90-second commentary. 'Mumia is global warming in a prison jumpsuit: cocktail conversation for cowards,' Gutfeld sniped. 'It's even odder that these tools crusade for gun control as they defend a cop killer. Screw 'em.'","Marc Lamont Hill is a Columnist University associate professor and Huffington Post broadcaster who interviews figures in U.S. black culture .

"Almost all galaxies are known to have a single supermassive black hole at their heart. But scientists have now found that one galaxy actually has three, and it could be a precursor to more such galaxies being discovered. The discovery could also help astronomers in the search for gravitational waves - the 'ripples in spacetime' predicted by Einstein. Astronomers have discovered three closely orbiting supermassive black holes in a galaxy more than 4 billion light years away. Illustrated here are helix-shaped jets from one supermassive black hole caused by its very closely orbiting companion, while the third black hole emits relatively straight jets due to its distance . Scientists view the the universe as being made up of a 'fabric of space-time'. This corresponds to Einstein's General Theory of Relativity which was published 1916. Objects in the . universe bend this fabric, and more massive objects bend it more. Gravitational waves are considered ripples in this fabric. They can be produced for instance, when black holes orbit each other or by the merging of galaxies. Gravitational waves are also thought to have been produced during the Big Bang. The finding, published in Nature, was made by an international team led by Dr Roger Deane from the University of Cape Town. They examined six systems thought to contain two supermassive black holes. The team found that one of these called SDSS J1502+1115 over 4 billion light years away contained three supermassive black holes. This is the tightest trio of black holes detected at such a large distance, with two of them orbiting each other at just 500 light years apart rather like binary stars. The finding suggests that these closely-packed supermassive black holes - each with a mass between 1 million to 10 billion times that of the sun - are far more common than previously thought. And the three supermassive black holes could also provide further observations of elusive gravitational waves. This is the tightest trio of black holes known to date and is remarkable since most galaxies have just one, usually with a mass between 1 million to 10 billion times that of the Sun, at their centre. The discovery suggests that such closely packed supermassive black holes (illustration shown) are far more common than thought . This particular discovery was made using a technique called Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) to discover the inner two black holes of the triple system. This technique combines the signals from large radio antennas around the world separated by up to 6,200 miles (10,000 kilometres) to see detail 50 times finer than that possible with the Hubble Space Telescope. This discovery was made with the European VLBI Network, an array of European, Chinese, Russian and South African antennas, as well as the 305 metre Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. Future radio telescopes, like the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), will be able to further measure the gravitational waves from such black hole systems. Gravitational waves from cosmic inflation generate a faint but distinctive twisting pattern in the universe. Shown here is the pattern observed with the Bicep2 telescope, providing what was thought at the time to be evidence for cosmic inflation after the Big Bang. The results have now been called into question . ‘What . remains extraordinary to me is that these black holes, which are at the . very extreme of Einstein's Theory of General Relativity, are orbiting . one another at 300 times the speed of sound on Earth,’ said Deane. ‘Not . only that, but using the combined signals from radio telescopes on four . continents we are able to observe this exotic system one third of the . way across the universe. ‘It . gives me great excitement as this is just scratching the surface of a . long list of discoveries that will be made possible with the Square . Kilometre Array (SKA).' Professor Matt Jarvis of Oxford University's Department of Physics, an author of the paper, added: 'General Relativity predicts that merging black holes are sources of gravitational waves and in this work we have managed to spot three black holes packed about as tightly together as they could be before spiralling into each other and merging. ‘The idea that we might be able to find more of these potential sources of gravitational waves is very encouraging as knowing where such signals should originate will help us try to detect these “ripples” in spacetime as they warp the universe.'","University of Cape Town-led research has found a bizarre distant galaxy .

"The pope has today criticised the 'slave labour' conditions at a Bangladesh factory which collapsed last week killing hundreds of workers - as a mass burial took place for dozens of unclaimed victims. Speaking at a private mass at the Vatican, Pope Francis said he . was shocked by reports that some of the workers were living on 38 euros a month. He said: 'This was the payment of these people who have died ... and this is called ""slave labour""'. Today, hundreds . attended the traditional Muslim funeral and many more looked on from the . roofs of nearby buildings as the 34 dead bodies - who were too battered or decomposed to be identified -  were taken to the graveyard on . flatbed trucks. Mass burial: The bodies of 34 unidentified garment workers killed when the Rana Plaza building collapsed in Bangaladesh have been interred in a mass burial a week after the disaster . Tragedy: Several hundred people attended the mass burial in Dhaka today, which took place amid calls for the owner of the collapsed building, Mohammed Sohel Rana, to face the death penalty . Police have now said that the death toll from the collapse has passed 400, with a total of 410 confirmed dead so far. As the bodies of the unclaimed . victims were placed in the graves, men and boys recited a traditional . Muslim prayer for the dead. Workers at the cemetery have dug several long rows of graves as authorities expect to bury scores more unidentified bodies in the coming days. Five garment factories were housed in the illegally constructed Rana Plaza building that collapsed last week, five months after a fire killed 112 people at another clothing factory. The tragedies exposed the unsafe conditions plaguing Bangladesh's garment industry, which supplies many European and American retailers. A country in mourning: A crowd gathered in front of the row of graves at the traditional Muslim funeral today, following the horrific collapse that exposed the unsafe conditions plaguing Bangladesh's garment industry . Death toll: Dozens of unclaimed bodies were buried in Dhaka today in the wake of the horrific accident, which claimed the lives of more than 400 workers . EU officials are considering action including changes to Bangladesh's duty-free and quota-free access to the giant EU market to 'incentivise' responsible management of the nation's garment industry. Pressure built inside Bangladesh as well, as a May Day procession of workers on foot, in pick-up trucks and on motorcycles wound its way through central Dhaka demanding safe working conditions and capital punishment for the building's owner. They waved the national flag and banners, beat drums and chanted 'Direct action!' and 'Death penalty!'. Anger: The building collapse, in which at least 410 people died and 2,500 were injured, was the worst industrial disaster in the country's history . Sorrow: The European Union is considering trade action against Bangladesh, which has preferential access to EU markets for its garments, in order to pressure Dhaka to improve safety standards after the building collapse killed hundreds of factory workers . Consequences: Rescue workers fear the death toll could rise even further after the collapse, which reduced the building filled with workers to an estimated 600 tons of rubble . From a loudspeaker on the back of a truck, a participant spoke for the group: 'My brother has died. My sister has died. Their blood will not be valueless.' Rescue workers expect the number of dead to rise because they believe many bodies are still buried on the ground level of the building. There is confusion over how many people remain missing. 'Their blood will not be valueless': The owner of the building is expected to be charged with negligence, illegal construction and forcing workers to join work - which is punishable by a maximum of seven years in jail . Fury: The owner of the collapsed building, Mohammed Sohel Rana, was seen wearing a police-issue helmet and body armour as he was escorted from a hearing at the High Court in Bangladesh yesterday . The owner of the building, Mohammed . Sohel Rana, is under arrest and expected to be charged with negligence, . illegal construction and forcing workers to join work, which is . punishable by a maximum of seven years in jail. Protesters demanded capital punishment for Rana, 38, a small-time political operative with the ruling Awami League party. 'I . want the death penalty for the owner of the building. We want regular . salaries, raises and absolutely we want better safety in our factories,' said Mongidul Islam Rana, 18, who works in a different garment factory. The . Bangladesh High Court has ordered the government to confiscate Rana's . property and freeze the assets of the owners of the factories in Rana . Plaza so the money can be used to pay the salaries of their workers. Rana . had permission to build five storeys but added three more illegally. When huge cracks appeared in the building a day before its collapse, . police ordered an evacuation, but Rana told tenants it was safe. The . next day, a bank and some shops refused to open but factory managers . told their workers to go back in. Hours later the building came down in a . heap of concrete. Rescuers estimate the building turned into 600 tons of rubble, of which 350 tons have been removed.","At least 410 people were killed when the illegally constructed Rana Plaza building collapsed into rubble last week .

"Climate change scientists warned . yesterday that the Earth is set for more heatwaves, floods, droughts and . rising sea levels that could swamp coasts and low-lying islands as . greenhouse gases build up in the atmosphere. But . despite these dire predictions, they admitted global warming is likely . to be more gradual than they previously thought and that world . temperatures have barely changed in the past 15 years. In . its first report for six years, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate . Change states that global warming is ‘unequivocal’ – and it is ‘95 per . cent certain’ that human activity is the ‘dominant’ cause. Scroll down for video . Enlarge . The IPPC reported revealed that it is 'extremely likely' that human activity is the dominant cause for global warming. It claims a rise in temperature in the Northern Hemisphere (right) will cause snow cover to decrease by 25 per cent by the end of the 21st century. But the report failed to conclusively explain why the rise in global average surface temperatures had largely 'paused' over the past two decades (left) The high latitudes and the equatorial Pacific Ocean are likely to experience an increase in annual mean precipitation by the end of this century (right). In many midlatitude . and subtropical dry regions, mean precipitation will likely decrease from the 1986-2005 period (left) UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said: ‘The heat is on. Now we must act.’ But . others questioned the credibility of the predictions, pointing out that . the IPCC’s research had signally failed to predict the ongoing ‘pause’ in rising world temperatures. Dr Benny Peiser, of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, said: ‘The IPCC has taken a huge gamble. ‘Unless . global temperatures begin to rise in the next few years, the IPCC is . very likely going to suffer an existential blow to its credibility.’ The . 36-page summary of the report was released yesterday after four days of . intense negotiations between officials from 110 countries and . scientists behind closed doors in Stockholm. It states that each of the . past three decades has been progressively warmer than any preceding . decade since 1850 and, in the Northern Hemisphere, 1983 to 2012 is . likely to have been the warmest 30-year period in the past 1,400 years. CO2 concentrations have . increased by 40 per cent since pre-industrial times, primarily from fossil fuel emissions, claims the IPCC. The ocean has absorbed about 30 per cent of the emitted . anthropogenic carbon dioxide, causing ocean acidification . Ocean acidification is determined by a decreases in pH. The pH of ocean surface water has decreased by 0.1 since the beginning of the industrial era, according to the report . It . also claims that it is ‘extremely likely’ that man is responsible for . ‘more than 50 per cent’ of the temperature rises seen since 1951. But . the report summary offered little detailed evidence to back up that . claim. The most . controversial part of the 2,000-page report, which will be released in . full on Monday, is the one that addresses why the rise in global average . surface temperature has ‘paused’. The . report acknowledges that temperature rises have dropped from 0.12c per . decade since 1951 to just 0.05c per decade since 1998 – despite record . amounts of greenhouse gases being pumped into the atmosphere. Critics . say this shows that carbon dioxide is not as damaging as had been . claimed and several governments called for references to the slowdown to . be amended or even removed from the report. In . fact, the slowdown is acknowledged more prominently than it was in . draft versions, with the IPCC saying that much of the ‘missing’ heat is . stored deep beneath the sea, preventing it from contributing to . temperatures at surface level. Volcanic eruptions and changes in the sun’s activity are also thought to have contributed. Scientists . say they are confident in the computer programs they use to model the . effects of carbon dioxide on the planet – they just can’t predict random . events such as volcanic eruptions. They say that such pauses in warming . occur regularly through history, the slowdown is only temporary and . climate change remains a pressing threat. For . the first time, the IPCC also makes a short-term forecast, saying that . temperatures will rise between 0.2c and 0.6c between now and 2035. By . the end of the century, the global average temperature could rise by . 4.8c. This is lower than the previous worst case scenario of 6.4c but . scientists stress it is still enough to have an ‘enormous’ impact on the . planet. The lowest . predicted temperature increase has also been scaled down from 1.1c, to . 0.3c – however, they claim achieving this would require rapid and . drastic cuts in emissions. Melting . ice and an expansion of water as it warms could drive sea levels up by . up to 32 inches by the end of the century – 40 per cent more than . previously predicted. The . IPCC also says it is ‘very likely’ that the Gulf Stream, which brings . heat north from the tropics and keeps Britain warmer than it would be . otherwise, will slow down. This could stop the temperature rising for . ten or 20 years in Britain but would be unlikely to make the country . much colder. The IPCC has . revised down its estimate of how sensitive the climate is to carbon . dioxide, saying that a doubling of levels in the atmosphere would raise . temperatures long-term by between 1.5c and 4.5c. The previous lower . limit was 2c. The report . says it is ‘extremely likely’ – or at least 95 per cent certain – that . the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation are the main cause of . rising temperatures since the Fifties. That level of certainty is up from 90 per cent in the report in 2007 and 66 per cent in 2001. The . world’s biggest environmental charities, including Greenpeace and . Friends of the Earth, called for immediate action to cut greenhouse gas . emissions. David MacKay, of . the Department of Energy & Climate Change, said reducing the amount . of carbon dioxide we pump into the atmosphere is unlikely to be enough. Instead, it is ‘very likely’ we will need to embrace new technologies . such as artificial trees that actively suck carbon out of the . atmosphere. The findings of the report and two that will follow will . feed into treaty talks in Paris in 2015. Energy . Secretary Ed Davey said: ‘This strengthens the case for international . leaders to work for an ambitious, legally binding global agreement in . 2015 to cut carbon emissions.’ David . Bull, of Unicef, said: ‘Scientists are more certain than ever that . climate change is real. How we choose to act now will make a vital . difference to the lives of today’s children and of future generations. ‘If we fail, our children will carry the devastating burden of our inaction.’ Scientists claim that global average sea levels will continue to rise during the 21st century under all temperature scenarios presented in the report. They say it will 'very likely' exceed that observed during 1971-2010 due to increased ocean warming and loss of mass from glaciers and ice sheets . During the longest period calculated (1901-2012), almost the entire globe experienced surface warming. The report said that warming of the climate system is 'unequivocal'. However, the report conceded that world temperatures have barely risen in the past 15 years . The authors of the latest IPCC report have clearly been stung by the barrage of criticism over the past few years. For while they are more confident than ever that mankind is changing the climate, several of the gloomier predictions from the previous 2007 analysis are toned down. Some of the changes reflect the science and growing sophistication of computer models. But other parts of the report appear to have been written in direct response to climate change sceptics. This follows huge embarrassment when claims that most Himalayan glaciers would vanish within 25 years were exposed as nonsense. Himalayan glaciers: Scientists have already withdrawn claims that they would vanish in 25 years . IPCC chairman Rajendra Pachauri said that ‘human failing’ led to the predicted date being brought forward by 300 years. In fact, the claim had been lifted from a report by the WWF. The latest report simply says that the world’s glaciers will shrink by between 15 and 85 per cent by the end of the century. One of the biggest differences between yesterday’s report and the 2007 version comes in a key figure, used to work out how much temperatures will respond to the extra greenhouse gases pumped into the air by factories, farming and cars. Six years ago, the IPCC estimated that a doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would increase temperatures between 2c and 4.5c. The latest update tones down that effect, known as the ‘equilibrium climate sensitivity’. Now the same increase in CO2 will lead to a rise of between 1.5c and 4.5c, the IPCC says. In 2007, the IPCC gave a range of estimates for temperature increases by the end of the century – from 1.1c above the 1850 levels to a whopping 6.4c hike. The new report is more measured, predicting increases between 0.3c and 1.7c if carbon emissions are halted almost immediately, and 2.6-4.8c if they are unchecked.There are other changes. In 2007, the authors of the report predicted that tropical storms would be more intense and frequent under a climate change future. Today, they are far less confident – and say there is only a ‘more likely than not’ chance of more intense tropical storms in North America and the Western North Pacific. As was widely anticipated, the report acknowledges that global warming has slowed down since the exceptionally hot year of 1998 – but adds that 15 years is not long enough to make any firm conclusions about this apparent pause. There is also a reference to the Medieval warm period – a time between 950 and 1250 when temperatures were similar to the late 20th century. However, the authors say this warming did not take place as coherently across seasons and regions as the current phase of global warming. Many of the predictions and measurements are more gloomy. Sea levels are now predicted to rise more quickly and carbon dioxide concentrations in the air are now the highest they have been for 800,000 years. In 2007, the levels were at a 650,000-year high. Six years ago, the scientists said it was ‘very likely’ that human behaviour was changing the climate, but they now believe it is ‘extremely likely’.","Report compiled by over 800 scientists and used 9,000 scientific studies .

Murray recovered from losing the opening set to win 6-7 (6/8) 6-0 6-3 7-5 against Tomas Berdych in a bad-tempered semi-final on Thursday and set up a Sunday showdown with world number one Novak Djokovic. The 27-year-old lost to Djokovic in the final in 2011 and 2013 and is looking to become the first man in the open era to win the title after losing three finals. His other defeat came to Roger Federer in 2010. Coach Amelie Mauresmo watches on as Andy Murray practises ahead of Sunday's Australian Open final .

Murray signs autographs for fans in Melbourne as he prepares for Sunday's Australian Open final . 'A lot of people criticised me for working with her and I think so far this week we have showed women can be very good coaches as well,' Murray said of Mauresmo, who won her first grand slam title in Australia in 2006. 'Madison Keys, who reached the semi-finals here, is also coached by a woman in Lindsay Davenport and I see no reason why that can't keep moving forward so I am very thankful to Amelie for doing it. I would say it was a brave choice from her and hopefully I can repay her in a few days. 'A lot of people were criticising her at the end of last year, like the way I was playing was her fault when I'd spent two weeks training with her up to the end of the year, until the training block. You can't change things during tournaments. There was very little time to spend with each other.'

However, Murray admitted there had been extra tension, which manifested itself in a tetchy encounter which even saw Murray's fiancee Kim Sears caught swearing on camera. 'A lot was made of Dani working with him,' Murray said. 'We've been friends since we were 15 and I felt like that was a bit unfair and unnecessary. 'This is sport, there is more to life, and I thought it was unfair and created a bit of extra tension.

"Ray Rice’s wife has been highly critical of NFL commissioner Roger Goodell over his handling of her husband’s suspension. In her first interview since her husband was reinstated to the league on Saturday, Janay Rice suggested that Goodell had lied about seeing a second video of the domestic video incident in order to save himself. ‘I can’t say he’s telling the truth,’ she told NBC’s Today show in footage due to air on Monday. ‘I know for a fact that... Ray told the honest truth.’ Scroll down for video . In her first interview since her husband was reinstated to the league on Saturday, Janay Rice suggested that Goodell had lied about seeing a second video of the domestic video incident in order to save himself . When footage showing Rice knock his then fiancé out cold in an Atlantic City elevator emerged in September, Goodell claimed that the former Ravens running back was ‘ambiguous’ in describing the February elevator attack. ‘I think they did what they had to do for themselves,’ she said. Rice is now eligible to sign with any NFL team after his indefinite suspension from the NFL was dropped on appeal by a U.S. District Judge. Janay also said that she’s confident that her husband - a three-time Pro Bowler and Super Bowl champ - will once again wear an NFL uniform. ‘I can’t say he’s telling the truth,’ Janey Rice told NBC’s Today show about NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell in footage due to air in the next couple of days . She told Today's Matt Lauer (left) that she was 'furious' with the former Baltimore Ravens player in the aftermath of the attack, however she knew her relationship would not be over . 'He’s proven himself as a football player for seven years,' she said. 'There’s never been a question on what he can do on the field.' The teams immediately mentioned as possibilities were the Denver Broncos, the Cleveland Browns and the Indianapolis Colts - a trio of likely playoff teams. Janay said she initially thought she was 'done' with the running back after he punched her in an elevator - but her 'heart' told her to stay with him. She told Today's Matt Lauer that she was 'furious' with the former Baltimore Ravens player in the aftermath of the attack, however she knew her relationship would not be over because she believed the ugly incident wasn't like him. On the night of the incident, Janay said she was annoyed with her husband because it was Valentines Day, and she wanted to go out as a couple - but they ended up being with friends. Controversial: Rice, pictured with his wife arriving at appeal hearing earlier this month, has had the indefinite suspension from the NFL overturned and he is now eligible to play for any team . She also said that she was drunk when Rice 'slapped' her in the elevator and her memory of the events is foggy. CCTV in the elevator of an Atlantic City Casino caught the player punching his then fiance to the floor. 'I was furious,' Janay told Lauer. 'We came home and we didn't talk the entire ride. 'I just knew he hit me, and I was done. I just didn't even want to entertain it. Any explanation.' Describing her reaction to the elevator incident, she said: 'Of course in the back of my mind and in my heart I knew that our relationship wouldn't be over because I know that this isn't us and it's not him,' Since then the pair have reconciled and got married a month after his arrest for aggravated assault. Earlier this month, Palmer - now Janay Rice - spoke to ESPN about the Atlantic City incident, saying it stemmed from an 'insignificant' argument between her and her husband. She told the station's Jemele Hill: 'As we were arguing, he was on his phone and not looking at me. I went to reach for his phone, and when he grabbed it back, he spit at me and I slapped him. 'We got into the elevator and what happened inside is still foggy to me. The only thing I know - and I can't even say I ""remember"" because I only know from what Ray has told me - is that I slapped him again and then he hit me. I remember nothing else from inside the elevator.' After coming round in the casino lobby, surrounded by police, Palmer was taken to the police station with her husband, who kept telling her 'It's going to be okay. We'll be okay'. Explaining her decision for standing by Rice, she said although she was 'angry', she 'knew it wasn't him' and he had never acted like that before. Shocking: Rice was suspended by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell for only two games following the one-punch knockout of his then-fiancée in an elevator at the New Jersey-based casino in February. CCTV captured the attack . 'No matter how long we have known each other and no matter what the circumstance is, Ray understands that violent behavior like this, even one time, is never acceptable,' she said. Initially, Rice was suspended by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell for only two games following the one-punch knockout of his then-fiancée in an elevator at the New Jersey-based casino in February. However, after security video of the altercation surfaced on TMZ in September, the Ravens released the three-time Pro Bowler, and his $35 million contract, and the NFL suspended him indefinitely. The day after Rice was released from his contract, Janay took to her Instagram to describe the 'horrible nightmare' she found herself in. Criticism over the two-day action led the NFL to toughen its penalties on domestic violence, with Mr Goodell admitting in a letter to team owners that he 'didn't get it right'. Newlyweds: The pair got married even after he was indicted on third degree aggravated assault charges . During the appeal, Rice's lawyers and the union argued the league had overstepped its authority in modifying former running back's two-game suspension, saying he was being 'sentenced' twice. In addition to testimonies from both Rice and Palmer - who supported her husband - Judge Jones heard from NFL security chief Jeffrey Miller and Ravens general manager Ozzie Newsome. In her decision on Friday, Judge Jones wrote: 'Because Rice did not mislead the commissioner and because there were no new facts on which the commissioner could base his increased suspension, I find that the imposition of the indefinite suspension was arbitrary. 'I therefore vacate the second penalty imposed on Rice. The provisions of the first discipline - those regarding making continued use of counseling and other professional services, having no further involvement with law enforcement, and not committing any additional violations of league policies - still stand.' The NFL did not immediately comment on Rice's verdict.

"Andy Murray will face Novak Djokovic in Sunday’s final of the Australian Open but will not have spent the evening quaking in his boots while watching in his hotel. World No 1 he may be, but the 27 year-old Serb was less than convincing in the course of a curious 7-6, 3-6, 6-4, 4-6, 6-0 victory over defending Melbourne champion Stan Wawrinka. These two have brought out the best in each other before, but there was an uneven quality about a contest that took a sapping three and a half hours, and which neither man seemed keen to win at times.

"It was not just Ivan Lendl who would have loved this performance from Andy Murray; John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors would have heartily approved too. Gloriously irascible, the 27 year-old Scot mentally and technically outmuscled Tomas Berdych in what became something of a grudge match to reach his fourth Australian Open final at the Rod Laver Arena on Thursday. After a shaky start Murray played superbly – as well as he has done since winning Wimbledon – to advance 6-7 (6-8), 6-0, 6-3, 7-5 in three hours and 26 minutes.

Murray will play either Novak Djokovic or Stanislas Wawrinka in the Australian Open final on Sunday in Melbourne . There was little love lost in a contest which was transformed after Berdych said something at the changeover following the first set that clearly riled Murray. It had been boiling up before then, and even the normally demure Kim Sears became unusually animated, caught uttering the odd oath in the supporters' box. Murray admitted afterwards that there was an unusual edge to it all, given that he was in opposition to his ex-coach Dani Vallverdu for the first time. He drew on that, as was obvious when he broke back in the first set and directed his celebration towards his opponent's box. It might have been habit, but probably not. 'There was a little bit of extra tension, it was a big match,' said Murray. 'A lot was made of Dani working with him. We have been friends since we were 15 years old. I thought it was a bit unfair to create a bit of extra tension out of it but it was there. Everyone calmed down after a bit.' Murray looked in supreme form again - as he has done for the past fortnight over in Melbourne .

The sun peaks through on a mild Australian evening in Melbourne as thousands watch inside the Rod Laver Arena . Berdych later explained what he said when the two passed at the changeover that seemed to annoy Murray. 'I really remember it well. I say to myself ""well done Tomas"". That’s it. I think I’m allowed to do that when I win a set. What, I have to be worried about every word I am going to say? I just pumped myself up for winning the first set then sat on the chair. Maybe next time I should stay even more calm, and that’s it. It was a great battle a good match, unfortunately with a bad end for me.' Murray, the 27 year-old Scot, also wanted to prove a point about his hiring of Amelie Mauresmo, saying: 'A lot of people criticised me working with her and I think so far this week we've shown that women can be very good coaches as well. 'Madison Keys who reached the semis here and had her best tournament is also coached by a woman in Lindsay Davenport and I see no reason why that can't keep moving forward like that in the future. 'I'm very thankful for Amelie for doing it. It was a brave choice from her to do it and hopefully I can repay her in a few days.' Murray fought back in the second set - beating Berdych to love in a stunning half hour of tennis . Murray had plenty of British supporters in the crowd as he looked to progress to the final . Berdych celebrates winning the first set after holding his nerve in the tiebreak . The No 6 seed added: 'I was obviously disappointed to lose the first set. I had a couple of chances at the end and break points at 5-5. I felt like I started to play better as the set went on and tried to stick to my game and was then very aggressive at the start of the second set. 'I changed tactics a little bit but also I was getting more comfortable with the conditions and the heavy ball that Tomas hits. In the second set I made him do most of the running. I started dictating the points, getting the first strike in. After losing a tough set like the first it as important to get the momentum back.' The reward is a fiendishly tough final, against either the world No 1 Novak Djokovic or defending champion Stan Wawrinka, who face off on Friday. Murray will have an extra day to recover, although historically that has never been a huge advantage here.

On whether he would be watching their semi-final, Murray said: 'I will definitely watch a little bit but judging by their matches in the last couple of years here I might be in bed before they're finished. So far both have been playing fantastic tennis so whoever has got tickets for that is very lucky.' Less contentiously than the spats, there were also several technical aspects that underpinned one of the more memorable victories of Murray's career. The Scot's first serve was excellent, particularly the slider he has perfected out to the deuce court. His movement was superb, and he frequently outmaneuvered the 6ft 5in Czech around the baseline. A tendency of Berdych has been to serve in a predictable fashion, and when he tried to push Murray wide with the serve the British No 1 was more agile to respond, and he began to read it perfectly from the second set onwards. Berdych, the perennial nearly man, could not adjust his thinking as much as the master tactician Murray, who is now in his eighth grand slam final.

"Tensions boiled over during Andy Murray's Australian Open semi-final victory against Tomas Berdych as the British No 1's fiancee appeared to fire an expletive-ridden blast towards his opponent. After Murray won a gruelling baseline rally in the first set to claim a break back, Sears was caught on camera apparently mouthing 'F***** have that you Czech flash f***'. It was just part of a series of heated moments during Murray's 6-7 (6-8), 6-0, 6-3, 7-5 win against Berdych on Thursday. Kim Sears was apparently recorded swearing about Tomas Berdych as tensions heated up in Melbourne . Sears' apparent foul-mouthed rant came as Andy Murray broke back in the first set . Sears showed her emotion as she watched the action from the stands . A mocked up image of what Sears was reported to have said from the stands . There were no microphones to pick up the 27-year-old’s exact choice of colourful words. But within moments of the uncharacteristic outburst being captured on film, thousands took to social media to comment on it, with some speculating that she had actually said: ‘Take that, you flash f***,’ or even: ‘F****** have it, you Czech f***.’ John Cassidy, a professional lip-reader, insisted that although Miss Sears’ mouth is partially obscured at the start of the utterance, he could ‘clearly’ see her saying: ‘You little f***.’ Asked about his girlfriend’s apparent cursing in the box Murray said: 'I was told about that. When there’s a lot of tension surrounding something which you (the media) created, then it’s completely normal that the whole first set everyone was tight. 'My physical trainer, the physio, I’m sure for Dani it was uncomfortable, even Tomas, who very rarely says anything on the court. There was tension there for him as well. In the heat of the moment you say stuff that you regret.' The build-up to the match had been dominated by talk of Murray going up against former coach Dani Vallverdu, who is now working with world No 7 Berdych, for the first time. Both had tried to play down that particular dynamic but there was no doubt it added a fiery edge to the match. Anyone thinking that all would be civil were surely thinking otherwise after Murray broke back for 4-5 in the first set. After coming out on top in a long exchange, Murray turned in the direction of Vallverdu sitting in his opponent's box and let out a wild roar in celebration.

Berdych was clearly incensed, giving the Scot a long stare as both players walked back to their chairs. As Murray sat down, he pumped his fist towards his own box, to which Sears responded with a fist pump of her own before clearly mouthing expletives as she glanced over towards Berdych's team. Moments later, Berdych complained to umpire Pascal Maria about the quality of the tennis balls, to which Murray responded: 'He always does this.' Berdych later explained what he said when the two passed at the changeover that seemed to rile Murray up: 'I really remember it well. I say to myself well done Tomas. That’s it. I think I’m allowed to do that when I win a set. What, I have to be worried about every word I am going to say? I just pumped myself up for winning the first set then sat on the chair.

As Murray let out some expletives in annoyance at his own play, the big screens in Rod Laver Arena further added to the drama. A 50-50 split screen was shown of Sears and Berdych's fiancee Ester Satorova. Sears appears to mouth: 'Oh for f*** sake.' It then came to a head between Murray and Berdych after the latter claimed a 76-minute first set. As he sat down in his chair, Murray complained to the umpire that Berdych had taken a dig at him as they walked past each other. He said: 'He's talking to me when we're passing.' Ester Satorova showed her support for fiancee Berdych during the tense game . Satorova, like her opposite number Sears, was put through a roller coaster of emotions . Berdych chipped in: 'Good play Tomas. That's all I said.' Meanwhile, American television coverage further built up the battle of the WAGS. ESPN displayed another split screen of Sears and Satorova, this time with added captions at the bottom with the estimated worth of their rings and amount of carats in their engagement bands. Murray quickly hit back on the court by taking the second set and then a break in the third had Berdych viciously hitting a ball high in the air which landed on the roof of the Rod Laver Arena.

Murray went on to close out the match and clinch a place in the final and the handshake between the pair at the net after was surprisingly civil after all that had gone on before. Asked out about the tension afterward, Murray said: 'There was a little bet extra tension. It is a big match and a lot was made of Dani working with him. Me and Dani have been friends since I was 15 years old an I felt that was a little bit unnecessary. 'This is sport and there's more to life than just sport. I thought it was maybe a little bit unfair and created a bit extra tension.

"Suspicious: Shane Todd was found dead in his Singapore apartment last summer. He apparently hanged himself, but his family claims he was murdered . The family of an American who died in Singapore believes he was killed by Chinese spies and is calling for a congressional investigation into his death. The body of Shane Todd, a 31-year-old electronics engineer, was found hanging from his bathroom wall just two days after his final day of work in June 2012. He was set to return to the U.S. the following week after quitting his job of 18 months at the Institute of Microelectronics. His death was reported a suicide and police in Singapore reported finding two suicide notes on his computer. But Todd's mother, Mary Todd, said she immediately doubted the authenticity of the notes. 'My son did not write this note,' she told Fox News. 'He did not take his own life.' Todd says her son had expressed concerns that his employers in Singapore were using him to help China access sensitive military technology to harm U.S. national security. 'He told us that his life was being threatened,' she said. 'As the weeks went on he got increasingly more agitated and distressed and would say things to me like, ""Mom I'm afraid I'm never going to see you again.""' Rick Todd, the man's father, said they are pursuing a congressional investigation into their son's death. He and his wife are meeting with Sen. Max Baucus of Montana in Washington on Friday to make their case, he told USA Today. The couple traveled from Montana to Singapore days after his death on June 23, 2012 to investigate where he had spent his last hours, Financial Times reported. At his apartment, they discovered several things awry, they said. Piles of laundry were neatly folded and ready to be packed in suitcases, packed moving boxes littered the apartment, and his plane ticket back to the States was sitting on his dining room table. Questions: Todd's parents, Rick (left) and Mary (right) are calling for a congressional investigation into their son's death . Close: Mary and Rick Todd, center, are mourning the death of their son Shane (back right, pictured with brothers John, back left, Dylan, front right, Chet and his wife Corynne , front left) Tragedy: Todd was found hanging from his bathroom wall just two days after his final day of work in June 2012 . The Singapore police report from last summer states that Mr Todd – who stood more than 6 feet tall and weighed 200 pounds – constructed a noose by bolting a pulley to the bathroom wall and wrapping a strap through the contraption. However, when the Todd family arrived days later, they were appalled to find that their late son’s front door was unlocked, there was no crime tape indicating an active investigation, and more importantly – no bolts drilled into the bathroom wall. The Singapore Police released a statement in response to the FT article, reading in part: ‘The police investigate all unnatural death cases thoroughly, working closely with the pathologist and other relevant experts, and no prior assumptions are made on the cause of death,’ according to Yahoo! Singapore. The FT article also states that the FBI bureau in Singapore has volunteered their forensic help on two separate occasions, but said that the local police had declined their help. An FBI source in Washington told the paper that they could do nothing to help the investigation until the Singapore Police formally accepted their assistance. In the statement, Singapore police added: ‘Since the death of Mr Shane Todd, the Police have engaged and assisted the family without impending the objectivity of our investigation process. We will continue to do so. Police have also kept the American Embassy and FBI informed of this case.’ The family also recovered a hard drive with backup data from his time at IME. The FT gave information on the hard drive to Colin Humphreys, the director of research at Cambridge University’s Centre for Gallium Nitride. Brothers: Shane Todd was one of four boys and his grieving family want to know the truth about his death . Warning signs: Todd became increasingly paranoid during his last couple weeks in Singapore . Humphreys said the data on Dr Todd’s hard drive related to a high-electron mobility transistor made from Gallium Nitride, or GaN. He said said the the project had applications for both the military and commercial use. The chemical is used in many of today’s . high-tech products, from Blu-ray players to hybrid electric cars, and . can withstand heat to much higher capacity than silicone. Final months: Colleagues said that Todd was depressed in the months preceding his death . The analyses of the hard drive also revealed that someone had tried to access information on it two days after Todd was reported dead. One of the companies in discussions with IME about the GaN technology was Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, which has been deemed a security risk by the House Intelligence Committee on the grounds that its equipment could be used for spying. Huawei has routinely denied such accusations and has said it is not linked to the Chinese government. In a statement to CBS, the Institute of Micro Electronics or IME said, 'neither IME nor Shane was involved in any classified research project. The Institute did not go beyond preliminary talks with Huawei.' IME is part of a network of research . institutes managed by government-run Agency for Science, Technology and . Research, or A*Star. A . former A*Star researcher now working in the United States pointed out . that IME and other A*Star institutes were not military research . organizations. Huawei said that the development of GaN technology was commonplace across the telecommunications industry. 'IME . approached Huawei on one occasion to cooperate with them in the GaN . field, but we decided not to accept, and consequently do not have any . cooperation with IME related to GaN,' Huawei said in a statement. Chemicals: Dr Todd was working with Gallium Nitrate (GaN), a synthetic material used in many high-tech objects like Blu-ray players and hybrid electric cars . Huawei declined to say whether they . had been working on other projects with IME. Colleagues said shortly . after Todd's death that he had told them at one point he had been . working on a project with Huawei but that it was not sensitive or . high-level in nature. One described it as carrying out 'measurement test reports' of semiconductors. Interviews with the family, . colleagues and friends revealed conflicting views on Dr Todd's state of . mind before his death, the nature of his work and how he died. Colleagues . said that he was increasingly depressed in his last few months, but . said that his concerns appeared to center on a sense of failure about . his work, and an ambivalence about returning to the United States. Mrs Todd said in a telephone interview with Reuters last July that her son  had been scared. On assignment: Dr Todd lived in the Chinatown district of Singapore; here the skyline is pictured . Big business: Huawei is one of the world's largest telecommunication equipment companies, but has been deemed a security risk by the U.S. congress on the grounds that its equipment could be used for spying . 'I . had been talking to him for months for at least an hour every week and . he told us he was afraid of being murdered because of his contacts with . the Chinese government,' she said. 'He quit his job because of it.' Dr Todd's parents said in interviews in July that Singapore police and IME had failed to properly investigate his death after his body was found hanging from a door in his Singapore apartment on the evening of June 24, two days after he quit IME. Singapore police say they have handled the case as they have handled other cases, and their procedures follow high international standards. They said in such cases of unnatural death, 'no prior assumptions' were made about the cause.","Shane Todd, an American working on an 18-month assignment in Singapore, was found hanged in his apartment in June 2012 .

"Two protesters have been injured after the Lebanese army today opened fire on a group blocking a road in protest of the massive car bomb that rocked Beirut yesterday. It comes as Lebanon's prime minister said today that the explosion is linked to the civil war in neighboring Syria, fuelling fears that the Syrian civil war could spill over into Lebanon. The bomb exploded during rush hour in the mainly Christian district of Ashrafiya killed eight including a top security official, and injured nearly 100 - deadliest bombing in Beirut in four years. Prime Minister Najib Mikati said the blast is linked to the intelligence chief's recent case, in . which he exposed an alleged plot by Syria to sow chaos in Lebanon. GRAPHIC CONTENT WARNING . Fired upon: The army opened fire on protesters in the village of Bar Elias as a group blocked roads with burning tyres and rocks today in response to the car bomb in Beirut, the deadliest in the city for four years. Pictured are protesters in southern city of Sidon . War to cross borders: There are fears that the Syrian civil war could spill over into Lebanon after a car bomb exploded in Beirut yesterday . Protesters in mostly Sunni . areas closed roads with burning tyres and rocks in Beirut, the southern . city of Sidon, the northern city of Tripoli and several towns in the . eastern Bekaa Valley. The army opened fire on a group in the village of Bar Elias in the eastern Bekaa Valley region. A witness said: 'The Lebanese army were trying to open the road and started firing their guns.' The government declared a national day of mourning for victims, who included Brig. Gen. Wissam al-Hassan, head of the intelligence division of Lebanon's domestic security forces. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati, whose government includes ministers from Hezbollah, said his government was trying to identify the perpetrators and they would be punished. A protester fuelling the fires in the southern city of Sidon today . Security: The protests came as the Lebanese Cabinet held an emergency meeting to discuss how to keep the peace . The Lebanese Cabinet held an emergency meeting today as the country's opposition called for Prime Minister Najib Mikati to resign. The state-run National News Agency said security commanders would attend the meeting to discuss how to keep the peace. Iran, Syria’s most powerful regional ally, has condemned a car bomb attack in Beirut today and suggested that Israel was to blame. A statement posted on the Iranian Foreign Ministry’s website today said: ‘This action was taken with the aim of sowing dissension among different currents and segments of the Lebanese people and was conducted by an element who has never had in mind the interests of the Lebanese people and government and who only strives for its own impure interests and goals. Iran condemn: Syria's most powerful ally Iran has condemned the a car bomb attack in Beirut today and suggested that Israel was to blame . Day of mourning: The government declared a national day of mourning for victims of the blast, which included Brig. Gen. Wissam al-Hassan, head of the intelligence division of Lebanon's domestic security forces . Rush hour: A car burns at the site of the explosion in the mainly Christian district of Ashrafiya which killed eight and injured nearly 100 . ‘Without a doubt the main enemy of the people of Lebanon and the region is the Zionist regime (Israel), which benefits from insecurity and instability in the region.’ The statement offered no evidence for the suggestion of Israeli involvement. Senior Israeli official Yigal Palmor has dismissed the suggestion as ‘beyond pathetic’. He said: ‘After the Iranian regime accused Israel of even the bad weather conditions prevailing in Iran, is there anything at all that they would not automatically blame on Israel? ‘This is beyond pathetic. It's pathological.’ Highway hindrance: The highway linking central Beirut with the city's international airport was closed due to the protests . Deadliest bomb: Police and army troops sealed off the site of Friday's blast as military intelligence agents investigated the bombing in Beirut . Many observers said the attack appeared to have links to the Syrian civil war, which has been raging for 19 months. Brig. Gen. Wissam al-Hassan, head of the intelligence division of Lebanon's domestic security forces, who died in the blast headed an investigation over the summer that led to the arrest of former Information Minister Michel Samaha, one of Syrian President Bashar Assad's most loyal allies in Lebanon. Samaha, who is in custody, is accused of plotting a campaign of bombings and assassinations to spread sectarian violence in Lebanon at Syria's behest. Also indicted in the August sweep was Syrian Brig. Gen. Ali Mamlouk, one of Assad's highest aides. Al-Hassan also played a role in the investigation of the 2005 assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri with a massive truck bomb. A U.N.-backed tribunal has indicted four members of militant group Hezbollah, which along with its allies, now holds a majority in Lebanon's Cabinet. Hezbollah denies involvement in Hariri's killing and has refused to extradite the suspects. His department also had a role in breaking up several Israeli spy rings inside Lebanon over the past few years, Lebanese officials said. Lebanon's fractious politics are closely entwined with Syria's, sharing a web of political and sectarian ties and rivalries, often causing events on one side of the border to echo on the other. Lebanon's opposition is an anti-Syrian bloc, while the prime minister and much of the government are pro-Syrian. The civil war in Syria has also exposed Lebanon's sectarian tensions. Assassin must be punished: Lebanon's top Sunni cleric, Grand Mufti Mohammed Rashid Kabbani, condemned the assassination, calling it a 'criminal explosion that targets Lebanon and its people' Many of Lebanon's Sunni Muslims have backed Syria's mainly Sunni rebels, while Shiite Muslims have tended to back Assad. Al-Hassan was a Sunni whose stances were widely seen to oppose Syria and Shiite Hezbollah, the country's most powerful ally in Lebanon. Lebanon's top Sunni cleric, Grand Mufti Mohammed Rashid Kabbani, condemned the assassination, calling it a ‘criminal explosion that targets Lebanon and its people’. He called for self-restraint and that ‘the criminal will get his punishment sooner or later’. Police and army troops sealed off the site of Friday's blast as military intelligence agents investigated the bombing in Beirut. Sharbal Abdo, a Beirut resident who lives down the block from where the car bomb detonated, brought his six-year-old son Chris and 12-year-old daughter Jane to see the debris today. Both children were at school when the blast ripped through the area. Mr Abdo said: ‘They were very afraid yesterday, and cried a lot late into the night. ‘Today I decided to bring them here and show what happened. They need to face this situation. It may be their future.’ Rafik Khoury, editor of the independent Al-Anwar daily newspaper, said the assassination was an attempt to draw Lebanon into the conflict in Syria, which has been the most serious threat to the Assad family's 40-year dynasty. He wrote: ‘The side that carried the assassination knows the reactions and dangerous repercussions and is betting that it will happen. Strife is wanted in Lebanon.’ The highway linking central Beirut with . the city's international airport was closed, as well as the highway that . links the capital with Syria, the officials said on condition of . anonymity in line with regulations.

"Residents living in a block of flats where a mother of two was beheaded have described how they heard bloodcurdling screams before police discovered her body. Judith Nibbs – who cared for the elderly and vulnerable – was found dead on Friday after an alleged row with her estranged husband. Detectives were greeted by horrific scenes when they arrived in the blood-spattered flat, situated near the million-pound homes of the trendy Shoreditch area of London. Victim: The headless body of Judith Nibbs was today discovered at her home near Old Street, in Shoreditch, London . They found the 60-year-old's dismembered body, while her estranged husband Dempsey Nibbs, 67, had apparently turned the knife on himself causing serious injuries. He is still in a critical condition after being taken to hospital at 5am on Friday. Police are waiting to question him over the death. Afzal Zahar, 32, who lived above Mrs Nibbs, told The Sunday People: 'My wife heard screaming and banging from downstairs.The police came soon after.' Mrs Nibbs, who lived on the Charles Square Estate, had worked for Hackney Borough Council for six years providing meals on wheels for the elderly, in addition to caring for her disabled daughter. Yesterday, her daughter Lauren left a heartbreaking message on Twitter which simply read: 'Mum?' Tributes were laid at the flat with one saying: 'Judith, can't believe we are not going to see you or that smiling face and your laugh again. We are all going to miss you. Love and kisses, Meals on Wheels.' Dean Cummings, 28, who has lived on the estate since he was born, said: ‘I’ve known her all my life. She was a nice lady and didn’t have a bad word to say about anybody. ‘She was always happy with a smile on her face. She had a disabled daughter and an older son who’s about 25. ‘She worked for her kids. The daughter’s in a home. Who’s going to bankroll that now? It’s just so sad. I’ve never seen her with a partner.’ Crime scene: Detectives who were called to the flat were confronted with horrific scenes, with blood splattered across the property . Horror: Ms Nibbs, 60, was found decapitated inside the home she once shared with her estranged husband Dempsey Nibbs. He was found to have turned the knife on himself causing himself serious injuries . Suspect: Mr Nibbs, 67, is in a critical condition in hospital. Police officers are waiting to question him in connection with the horrific murder . Andrew Pemberton, 42, who lives in the same block as the low rise apartment block, said: ‘I think she worked for Hackney Council meals on wheels. I used to see her going to work in a high-visibility vest. ‘It’s just terrible on your own doorstep. She has a son and a daughter but didn’t have a partner as far as I knew.’ Detectives were today seen searching bins surrounding her ground floor flat looking for the weapon. Investigation: A police spokesman said detectives are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident . One man, who lives next door to the woman and her 29-year-old son, said he was woken by police shouting. The 27-year-old man who wanted only to be known as Cihan, said: ‘They were banging on my door and jumping on the bins to get over the back garden. ‘They just said a “serious incident” was going on. She kept herself to herself and hardly seemed to go out.’ No arrests have been made, but police said they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the investigation. Next of kin have been informed, but the woman has not been formally identified. A post-mortem examination is expected to take place early next week. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘A murder investigation has been launched in Hackney. ‘Police were called by paramedics at around 5am to Charles Square Estate following concerns for the welfare of a resident. ‘Officers attended and found a 60-year-old woman deceased at the location. ‘Formal identification is yet to take place. Next of kin have been informed. A post-mortem examination will be held in due course. ‘A 67-year-old man was taken by ambulance to an east London hospital where he remains in a critical condition. ‘There have been no arrests. Detectives are not looking for anyone else in connection with the investigation.’ Cordon: Police officers erected a cordon around Vince Court in Brunswick Place, Old Street where the headless body of Judith Nibbs was discovered. Forensic officers scoured the scene for evidence .

"Arthur Oszek, 86, was admitted to Ayr General Hospital hospital after a fall. He was put on the Liverpool Care Pathway and had his food and fluids  removed for several days . A woman has spoken of her heartbreak after her father died - she believes after being put on Liverpool Care Pathway. Arthur Oszek, 86, was admitted to Ayr General Hospital hospital after a fall. But for several days Mr Oszek, a diabetic, had his food, drink and some of his medication removed, his stepdaughter claims. Ann Murdoch was told her father had been put on the Liverpool Care Pathway in a bid to let his body focus on medication to make his final days as comfortable as possible. But Ms Murdoch, 65, was furious that doctors hadn't asked for permission to put him on the pathway and demanded he be taken off it. After 20 hours of discussions, doctors agreed to restore his food and drink. But by then it was too late and his body gave up the fight, his feet turning back. He died just 17 hours later on August 25 last year. Ms Murdoch said it took her months to come to terms with her father's loss and . it was only when she heard of similar cases where people were put on the . Liverpool Care Pathway without consent that she felt she couldn't hold . back her anger any more. Last month a major review was announced into the Liverpool Care Pathway, by the Association for Palliative Medicine. The group, which represents 1,000 doctors who work in hospices and specialist hospital wards, will 'identify and explore concerns' over the system of caring for patients in their final days. The review comes as several families have said their loved ones were put on the pathway without their consent. Speaking from her home in Kirkcaldy, Fife, Ms Murdoch claimed NHS doctors had robbed her father's right to live. Mr Oszek's daughter Ann Murdoch (right) said her father had begged for water and his cracked lips showed he was severely dehydrated . The retired shop manageress said: 'It was dreadful, he was taken into the hospital because he had a couple of falls and at first he was put on the drip. 'But then after a number of days he was suddenly taken off it and he was just begging for a drink, saying ""I'm so thirsty"".' 'We asked the doctors why he was taken off his drip and we were told he was on the Liverpool Care Pathway. 'We didn't even know what is was, there's no way that should have happened without asking us. 'We kicked up a fuss and demanded he be put back on his medication, and eventually they agreed about 20 hours later.' But Mr Oszek, a former miner, died within 24 hours as his body was unable to recover from his frail state, his family claim. Although the great-great-grandfather-of-one was surrounded by Ms Murdoch and his other daughter Helena when he passed away, it was an uncomfortable end to his life, they say. Ms Murdoch added: 'He was left dying there for 17 hours until the inevitable happened. No one should have to see their loved one needlessly die like that in front of them. 'You wouldn't even make a dog die like that, he was just left to die on his own - none of the doctors came in to check on his condition, in the end we were dabbing a damp cloth over his cracked lips. 'My granddaughter had a camera with her and she took a few photos of him when his feet turned black - it was so distressing.' After 20 hours of discussions with the family, doctors agreed to restore Mr Oszek's drip, but his feet began to turn black and he died shortly afterwards . She said: 'Our dad wanted to live, the nurse even said ""you want to live, don't you Arthur"", but the doctors denied him that right. 'We don't want anyone else to suffer what we have suffered. My father was a character and a very caring person, he looked after my mother in her final years when she had cancer - he didn't deserve what happened to him. 'He was on a lot of medication, but he was living at home, he was able to look after himself with the aid of a care worker from the council. 'He was fully aware of what was going on around him and he was happy. He should have lived a lot longer.' Mandy Yule, Director of Integrated Care and Partner Services at NHS Ayrshire and Arran said although they could not comment Mr Oszek's case until an official complaint was received from his family, she insisted they always consult families before proceeding with the Liverpool Care Pathway. She said: 'The Liverpool Care Pathway is an end-of-life care plan to ensure that patients in the last few days of life receive the quality of care needed. 'The patient's condition is continually monitored in order to assess the patient's needs and to provide support to their relatives or carers. 'Communication with patients and their families is central to end-of-life care. The Liverpool Care Pathway does not preclude the use of clinically assisted (artificial) hydration or nutrition and all clinical decisions are made with the patient's best interest and comfort in mind.' A former version of the article described the Liverpool Care Pathway as “a withdrawal of food and fluids”. We are happy to make clear that the LCP is intended to ease the final hours of patients who are close to death and to spare them the suffering associated with invasive treatment and the needless prolonging of life. Once a patient is no longer able to eat or drink, consideration is given as to whether fluids and nutrients should continue to be provided.","Arthur Oszek, 86,  was admitted to Ayr General Hospital hospital after a fall .

"Republicans are cheering over House Speaker John Boehner's decision to dig in his heels by not compromising with President Obama over the mandated $85billion in spending cuts. Because no deal was reached, the President had to order the beginning of the drastic sequester, forcing federal agencies to cut billions in accordance with a dramatic way to cut down the deficit. Though his blatant show of partisanship may strike some as callous, it is winning him a lot of points from conservative members of his party who previously felt that they were being ignored. Scroll down for video . Facing public scrutiny: Neither side looks particularly good from the sequester fight but Republicans are very supportive of Speaker John Boehner's tough approach and his refusal to negotiate . President Obama cast blame on Congress for failing to avoid the sequester cuts . 'He’s doing exactly what he said he was going to do, and I think it’s working to our favor and to his,' Representative Mick Mulvaney said to The New York Times. 'I get the feeling that our party is probably more unified right now than it has been at any time in the last several months.' At the beginning of the year, Mr Boehner was not the most popular man in his party and there were even rumblings that he may be unseated. The tides have clearly shifted as he leans in towards the right of his base. 'We asked him to commit to us that when the cuts actually came on March 1, that he would stand firm and not give in, and he’s holding to that,' conservative Republican Steve Scalise told the paper. 'I think Friday will be an important day that shows we’re finally willing to stand and fight for conservative principles and force Washington to start living within its means. And that will be a big victory.' Conservative support: Republican Representatives Steve Scalise (left) and Mick Mulvaney (right) both lauded Boehner's actions saying that he is playing tough and honoring Republican principles . Headed in without hope: Boehner agreed to nothing during the last-ditch negotiation session . Mr Boehner has also won himself a big-name fan in Mitt Romney, but his support comes more at Mr Obama's expense rather than as a result of Mr Boehner's tactics. 'Well, no one can think that that's been a success for the President,' the former presidential candidate said in his first post-campaign interview with Fox News Sunday. 'He didn't think the sequester would happen. It is happening, but to date, what we've seen is the president out campaigning to the American people, doing rallies around the country, flying around the country and berating Republicans and blaming and pointing. That causes the Republicans to retrench and to put up a wall and to fight back. It's a very natural human emotion. 'The President has the opportunity to lead the nation and to bring Republicans and Democrats together. It's a job he's got to do, and it's a job only the President can do.' President Obama officially signed off on the $85billion in spending cuts on Friday night after congressional leaders fail to compromise on a replacement deal, leaving thousands of Americans in fear for their jobs. Sharing his thoughts: Former presidential candidate Mitt Romney said that the sequester is not a good move for President Obama and he blamed his former opponent for 'forcing' Republicans to dig in their heels . The letter was formally sent to Mr Boehner at 9pm on Friday night and was welcomed by no one involved, as both the Republicans and Democrats agree that it is a bad deal that can drastically damage the country's economy but neither are willing to give in. 'The Joint Committee sequestration is a blunt and indiscriminate instrument. It was never intended to be implemented and does not represent a responsible way for our Nation to achieve deficit reduction,' the formal letter kicking off the seven months of spending cuts reads. The President made his displeasure with the deal known in a formal statement from the pres briefing room. 'Starting tomorrow, everybody here, . all the folks who are cleaning the floors at the Capitol … They're going . to have less pay, the janitors, the security guards. They just got a . pay cut, and they got to figure out how to manage that,' Obama said. 'That's real... that's not a scare tactic.' Obama made the remarks from the White . House following a meeting with House Speaker John Boehner and Senate . Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, as well as Democratic leaders Nancy . Pelosi and Harry Reid. Boehner emerged from the . meeting and told reporters that taxes were off the table as an option . to avoid the spending cuts, making it clear that no compromise had been . made. House Speaker John Boehner emerged from a White House meeting and declared that taxes are off the table as an option to avoid thesequester cuts . 'The discussion about revenue, in my view, is over,' he said. 'It's about taking on the spending problem.' In an interview with NBC later in the day, Boehner said he never really saw a path forward that avoided the sequester. 'If I did, that meeting at the White House today might have gone better,' he said. 'The sequestration is a blunt   and indiscriminate instrument.    It was never intended to be implemented' -Office of Management and Budget . Obama blamed Republicans for the country's predicament, claiming that there are many conservatives on Capitol Hill who agree with him, but are unwilling to say so publicly. 'We just need Republicans in Congress to catch up with their own party and the country on this,' he said. President Obama wanted to replace the so-called sequester with a plan that would raise revenues as well as make a series of targeted spending cuts. But after making concessions on taxes in December by raising rates on the wealthiest of Americans, Republicans said they were unwilling to include new revenues in a plan to avert the sequester. Asked why Congress was not even in . session on the sequestration deadline day, Obama snarled that he could . not employ a 'Jedi mind meld' to force cooperation between lawmakers. 'I'm not a dictator,' he said. 'I'm the president.' The . immediate impact of the reductions remains uncertain, even as Obama has . declared it would mean 'hundreds of thousands of jobs lost.' The . administration has pulled back on earlier warnings of long lines . developing quickly at airports and teacher layoffs affecting classrooms. Because of those claims, Obama has been accused of posturing and exaggerating the effects of the cuts. His warnings of economic doom appeared to be a partial attempt to avert blame in the future if the economy begins to contract. 'Every time that we get a piece of economic news over the next month, two months or six months...  We'll know that that economic news could have been better if Congress had not failed to act,' he said. 'I don't anticipate a huge financial crisis, but people are going to be hurt. The economy will not grow as quickly as it would have, unemployment will not go down as quickly as it would have,' Obama said . Industries most affected by the cuts . will be those that rely heavily on government funding, including the . military and defense contractors. 'Communities near military bases will take a serious blow,' Obama said. 'Border patrol agents, FBI agents ... all will suffer significant pay cuts and furloughs.' While Obama warned off mass layoffs and smaller salaries as an immediate result of the cuts, he also hedged his warnings, saying, 'This is not going to be an apocalypse... It's just dumb.' He urged Congress to continue working on a plan to eventually replace the sequester. 'I don't anticipate a huge financial . crisis, but people are going to be hurt, he said. 'The economy will not grow as . quickly as it would have, unemployment will not go down as quickly as it . would have.' Vice President Joe Biden arrives at the White House for a closed-door meeting with President Barack Obama and congressional leaders on the automatic spending cut . Senate Minority Leader Mitch . McConnell, R-Kentucky, said Senate Republicans would pursue a plan to maintain the sequester cuts but target them more intelligently.  He reiterated . that tax increases were off the table. 'I want to make clear that any . solutions will be done through the regular order, with input from both . sides of the aisle in public debate,' he said. 'I will not be part of . any back-room deal and I will absolutely not agree to increase taxes.' The meeting at the White House between Obama and congressional leaders, which . lasted just under an hour, ended around 11:10 a.m. No . breakthrough was expected to come out of the talks. But the meeting was . an opportunity for all sides to stake out their fiscal positions with . the threat of a government shutdown looming less than four weeks away. Department of Defense .

"An internet blackout has hit Syria, leaving the war-torn country without online access for almost seven hours. The outage - which lasted from 12.30pm to 7pm yesterday - was blamed on a 'breakdown in the optical fibre cable' in Damascus countryside, according to the state-owned Syrian Arab News Agency. Only one online link remained during the outage - via TurkTelecom connecting Aleppo, a city which has seen intense fighting during the civil war that began in 2011 and has left 100,000 dead. Down for seven hours: This graphic from internet monitoring firm Renesys shows the outage - which lasted from 12.30pm to 7pm and was blamed on a 'breakdown in the optical fibre cable' in Damascus countryside . Blackout: The outage was also shown in this graphic on Twitter from cybersecurity company Akamai . The outage was reported by internet monitoring firm Renesys and cybersecurity company Akamai. Doug Madory, a researcher at Renesys, told The Washington Post: ‘Unfortunately, (the) internet outage in Syria is just the latest communications blackout in the country's long-running civil war. ‘The link to Turkey, established last summer, appears intact, which is consistent with outages over the past few months. Aleppo's outages occur independently from the country-wide blackouts.’ A hacktivist group called the European Cyber Army yesterday claimed responsibility on Twitter for the blackout, saying it was in retaliation for attacks by the Syrian Electronic Army on Western systems. War-torn country: Only one online link remained during the outage - via TurkTelecom connecting Aleppo (pictured), a city which has seen intense fighting during the civil war that has left 100,000 dead . Destruction: Men inspect damage at a site hit by what activists said were barrel bombs dropped by forces loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad in Aleppo's district of al-Sukari on Sunday . ‘As you may or may not have noticed, Syria was wiped off the face of the internet,’ the group said yesterday. ‘SEA is a grave threat...

Malia Obama, who turns 16 on July 4, spent a day working as a production assistant on the set of Halle Berry‘s upcoming sci-fi series Extant. The series is being produced by prominent Obama donor Steven Spielberg. Scroll for video . Malia Obama, who turns 16 on July 4, spent a day last week working as a production assistant on the set of Halle Berry's upcoming sci-fi series Extant . First Lady Michelle Obama accompanied Malia to the CBS Studios as the teen helped with re-shoots of the pilot episode, assisting with computer alignments, and the director even let her use a production slate before a take. An unnamed source told TheWrap.com that Malia laughed with delight saying, ‘My first time. This is a big deal.’ In the series Berry plays an astronaut who returns home from a year-long solo mission in space and tries to reconnect with her husband and son. Her experiences in space and home lead to events that ultimately change the course of human history. In Extant, Hallie Berry plays an astronaut who returns home from a year-long solo mission in space and tries to reconnect with her husband and son . Extant is being produced by Steven Spielberg, who presented President Barack  with an Ambassador for Humanity Award earlier this year . Neither CBS nor a spokesperson for the First Lady have so far commented. Malia attends the exclusive Sidwell Friends private school in Washington, DC, but classes let out earlier this month. President Obama, Michelle and Malia enjoyed a four-day weekend in southern California, staying at a private residence inside the gated community of Thunderbird Heights, in the high-end city of Rancho Mirage. The President and First Lady flew in Friday. Obama delivered the commencement address at the University of California, Irvine, on Saturday before attending a fundraiser in Orange County. Sasha Obama apparently did not make the Father’s Day weekend trip, which was expected to include golfing and perhaps some house-hunting for the Obamas, reports Press Enterprise. President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama, are greeted on the tarmac by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., second from left, and her husband Stewart Boxer, left, as they arrive in Palm Springs, California, on Friday . The Obama family is scheduled to fly home to Washington, D.C. mid-morning on Monday. At Saturday's commencement address, the President said denying climate change is like arguing the moon is made of cheese. Obama issued the call to the tens of thousands gathered at Angel Stadium even though he said Congress 'is full of folks who stubbornly and automatically reject the scientific evidence' and say climate change is a hoax or fad. Obama said others duck the question. 'They say, ""Hey, look, I'm not a scientist."" And I'll translate that for you: what that really means is, ""I know that manmade climate change really is happening but if I admit it, I'll be run out of town by a radical fringe that thinks climate science is a liberal plot,'"" he said. President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama wave to people gathered on the tarmac, after they arrived at Palm Springs International Airport in Palm Springs on Friday . Obama also used the address to announce a $1 billion competitive fund for communities who have experienced natural disasters to rebuild and prepare for the impact of extreme weather. He described a political system consumed by 'small things' but said Americans should be determined to do 'big things' like addressing climate change, despite the type of opposition he faces from Congress. 'There's going to be a stubborn status quo and people determined to stymie your efforts to bring about change. There are going to be people who say you can't do something. There are going to be people who say you shouldn't bother trying. I've got some experience with this myself,' Obama said. 'It's pretty rare that you'll encounter somebody who says the problem you're trying to solve simply doesn't exist. 'When . President Kennedy set us on a course to the moon, there were a number . of people who made a serious case that it wouldn't be worth it,' he . continued. Commencement: President Obama spoke at the commencement address at University of California, Irvine, on Saturday . 'But nobody ignored the science. I don't remember anybody saying the moon wasn't there or that it was made of cheese,' Obama said. The president said today's young dreamers are fed a steady diet of cynicism but argued they have a right to be optimistic. 'Consider this: since the time most of you graduated from high school, fewer Americans are at war,' Obama said. 'More have health insurance. More are graduating from college. Our businesses have added more than nine million new jobs. 'And the number of states where you're free to marry who you love has more than doubled. That's just some of the progress you've seen.' Optimistic: Obama told the graduates they have a reason to be optimistic about their futures in America . While in Orange County, Obama also raised money for the Democratic National Committee at a closed-door fundraiser at the Laguna Beach home of Getty oil heiress Anne Earhart. About 25 people paid up to $32,400 to participate in a roundtable discussion with the president.

"Scottish banks are filling up cash machines in case of a dash to withdraw money in the event off a Yes vote. The move to keep ATMs stocked is part of a package of measures put in place in an effort to avoid financial panic. Banking industry sources insist there will be no immediate risk to anyone’s savings if Scotland votes to split from the rest of the UK. Scroll down for video . Scottish banks are filling up ATMs in case of a dash to withdraw money in the event of a Yes vote (file picture) But senior figures have recognised the risk that some people will be concerned and start to withdraw money. Should cash machines run dry it could fuel public fear. ‘We did not have to be asked by the Bank of England, it is just a natural part of what we said we would do,’ said one bank source. Pledges to keep cash machines full are part of the contingency plans all banks are understood to have submitted to the Bank of England ahead of the vote. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has confirmed it has a contingency plan of its own in place, but has given no details. In the event of a Yes vote, the Governor is expected to make an emergency statement, reassuring bank customers and markets that the Bank of England would remain the regulator and the lender of last resort to banks in Scotland until independence was formally declared, which Alex Salmond has said would occur about 18 months after a Yes vote. Until then, all deposits in Scotland would also still be covered by the UK’s Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), which protects savings up to the value of £85,000. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has confirmed it has a contingency plan for a Yes vote, but has not revealed any details . Banks have reported rising concern among both business and personal customers over what a Yes vote might mean. There have been reports of customers moving cash from Scottish to English branches, but it is understood that the levels of movement have not yet caused alarm at the Bank of England. Last week five banks legally based in Scotland – Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, Clydesdale, TSB and Tesco Bank – all said that they would move their official home to England in the event of a Yes vote.","Raft of measures put in place to avoid financial panic in event of a Yes vote .

"Osama bin Laden's son-in-law is being held in a super-secret 'terror wing' of a fortress-like federal prison that has housed some of the most notorious criminals of recent memory. Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, who pleaded not guilty Friday to charges of conspiring to kill Americans on 9/11, is in a cell that's eight feet by 12 feet inside the Metropolitan Correctional Center. He's locked up just blocks from the former site of the World Trade Center where nearly 3,000 people were killed on 9/11. The grim MCC is a mini Guantanamo Bay . where prisoners are locked up for 22 hours a day. Hook-handed preacher of hate Abu . Hamza, who was deported from Britain to face terrorism charges in the . same court, is also in the same jail on the Terror Wing reserved for . high risk inmates. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The Metropolitan Correctional Center's 'Terror Wing' is where Sulaiman Abu Ghaith is being held on charges of conspiring to kill Americans on 9/11 . A typical cell inside the notorious, fortress-like prison which is located just blocks from the former site of the World Trade Center . Delay: Federal budget cuts could delay the start of a terrorism trial for Osama bin Laden's son-in-law, Sulaiman Abu Ghaith . 'Terrorist:' Ghaith is the highest ranking member of Al Qaeda to appear in a U.S. civilian court . The prison is considered one of the . harshest in the nation and Lawyers for ‘Lord of War’ arms trader Viktor Bout, who spent 14 months there in solitary, said it was so vile that it was like the jail depicted in the Alexandre Dumas novel The Count of Monte Cristo. Rooms are said to be filthy and anyone who participates in group exercise sessions on the roof is subjected to an invasive search afterwards to make sure they do not have anything that harms them or others. Prison guards are also known to pound on the doors at 2am and 5am and shine their flashlights in to make sure prisoners are still there. Lockdown is at 10:45pm every night, although that can be extended to 2am on weekends with the special permission of the governor or warden. Wake up call is at 6am and breakfast is served 30 minutes later. Among those who have been held at the MCC include mafia crime boss John Gotti, disgraced financier Bernie Madoff, failed Times Square bomber Faisal Shahzad and 1993 World Trade Centre bomber Ramzi Yousef. No view: Lockdown is at 10:45 p.m. every night and guards bang on the doors twice during the night to make sure prisoners are still in their cells . Hunted down: Osama Bin Laden, left, was killed . in 2011 in Pakistan after years of searching. The terror leader is shown . at right, watching himself on TV in his secret compound . Ghaith entered his plea Friday through a lawyer during a brief court appearance. Bin Laden's  son-in-law will be prosecuted by the same team that indicted the Al Qaeda leader and terror mastermind. Ghaith, who did the mob equivalent of marrying the boss' daughter, spoke only to confirm he understood what has happening during the 17-minute hearing. The 47-year-old wore a standard issue navy blue prison top and trousers and looked despondent, staring intently at his translator throughout. FBI Assistant Director in Charge George Venizelos has called him the terror equivalent of a 'consigliere in a mob family.' He denied being what the U.S media have called the 'loudmouth son-in-law' to bin Laden, whose eldest daughter Fatima he married. According to a six-page indictment, Abu Ghaith is said to have conspired to kill Americans and boasted of the 9/11 attacks, which he also may have helped to plan. An artist sketch of Suleiman Abu Ghaith from his federal court hearing today where he pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy to kill Americans . Ghaith only spoke in single-word answers as he entered his not guilty plea during the 17-minute hearing in federal court . The day after the terror attacks, he appeared in a video in which he urged 'the nation of Islam' to wage war on 'the Jews, the Christians and the Americans.' He later warned in another video that 'the storms shall not stop, especially the airplane storm' and told  Americans 'not to board any aircraft and not to live in high rises.' Abu Ghaith is the most senior figure from Al Qaeda to face justice in a US court since it began its war on terrorism after the September 11 attacks, which killed 2,995 people. His prosecution in New York is a mark of how determined America was to get him – the FBI agents and District Attorneys who indicted bin Laden 15 years ago are based there and have been asked to assist on his case. At Manhattan's Federal Court Friday, which is a few blocks from Ground Zero, Judge Lewis Kaplan denied Abu Ghaith bail and said that the next hearing will take place on April 8. Members of the media gather in the snow outside Manhattan Federal Court for Ghaith's arraignment . Abu Ghaith, a former preacher, was arrested in Ankara, Turkey on February 28. According to the New York Times, the Turkish authorities refused to extradite him to the US so he was deported to his native Kuwait. On a stopover in Jordan he was supposedly picked up by CIA agents and flown to New York where he arrived on March 1. The case marks a legal victory for the Obama administration, which has long sought to charge senior Al Qaeda suspects in civilian courts instead of holding them in Guantanamo Bay - but Republicans say they should remain there. Proximity: This map shows the distance between the World Trade Center site and U.S. District Court, where Abu Ghaith will appear today . Ghaith was arrested in a dramatic take-down by CIA officials in Jordan several days ago, and is now being held in a detention facility in lower Manhattan. In 2001, Abu Ghaith is said to have . been imprisoned alongside al-Qaeda’s military director Saif al-Adel and . bin Laden's son Saad, after the leader sent them to Iran in the . hopes that they would be seen as ‘an enemy of my enemy,’ a U.S. official . said. Although the U.S. would not confirm . the conditions of their confinement, Iranian officials told NBC News the . al-Qaeda leaders had been captured shortly after their arrival in the . country in 2001 and had spent time ‘in jail.' Court papers state that before the 9/11 attacks, bin Laden 'summoned' Ghait to his side and asked for his assistance. Ghaith then warned the U.S. and its allies that 'a great army is gathering against you' and after the terror attacks 'the storms shall not stop, especially the Airplanes Storm.' Ghaith will be the most senior al-Qaeda member and closest bin Laden associate to face a trial in New York. Day in court: Abu Ghaith's trial will most likely be in U.S. District Court, pictured, less than a mile from the site of the 9/11 attacks . Others, including 'mastermind' Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, are being tried by a military tribunal at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Attorney General Holder said in a statement: 'No amount of distance or time will weaken our resolve to bring America's enemies to justice. 'To violent extremists who threaten the American people and seek to undermine our way of life, this arrest sends an unmistakable message: . 'There is no corner of the world where you can escape from justice because we will do everything in our power to hold you accountable to the fullest extent of the law.' Records compiled by a United Nations . sanctions committee show that Abu Ghaith was born in Kuwait in 1965, but . that he left Kuwait for Pakistan in June 2001. He then married one of bin Laden's daughters, Fatima. 'Ghaith  held a key position in al-Qaeda, comparable to the consigliere in a mob family or propaganda minister in a totalitarian regime,' said FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Venizelo. After the September 11 attacks, Ghaith first surfaced as one of al-Qaeda's main spokesmen. Later, . U.S. officials believe he was part of a group of top figures in the . group that included one of bin Laden's sons, Saad, who allegedly . traveled to Iran, where the Iranian government claimed they were 'in . custody.' The Long War . Journal, a counterterrorism blog published by the conservative . Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, reported in 2010 that Abu . Ghaith had been released by Iranian authorities and supposedly had . returned to Afghanistan. Rep. Peter King (R-NY) announced Ghaith's arrest on Thursday, hailing it as a 'very significant victory' in the ongoing fight against al-Qaeda. King, the former chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, said the CIA and FBI had caught Ghaith within the last week. He said the arrest was confirmed by U.S. law enforcement officials. Ghaith had allegedly taken part in the September 11 plot against the World Trade Center and Pentagon. Wanted: Ghaith had been considered 'stateless' since since he lost his Kuwaiti citizenship after videos emerged showing him praising the September 11 attacks . 'Definitely, one by one, we are getting the top echelons of al-Qaeda,' King said on Thursday. 'I give the (Obama) administration credit for this: it's steady and it's unrelenting and it's very successful.' A terrorism analyst called  Ghaith a 'big fish' who represents the 'core of al-Qaeda.' 'Ghaith is one of ten guys left that have the financial ties and reputation who might have been able to get the old band back together to execute spectacular international terror attacks,' Dr. Thomas Lynch at the National Defense University told ABC News. Turkish newspaper Hürriyet reported that Ghaith was passing through Jordan, on his way to Kuwait from Turkey when he was apprehended. Terror: After the September 11 attacks, Abu Ghaith first surfaced as one of al-Qaeda's main spokesmen . The newspaper said that Ghaith was initially taken into custody more than a month ago at a luxury hotel in the Turkish capital Ankara. Turkish officials decided he had not committed any crime in Turkey and released him the newspaper reported. A Turkish court reportedly ruled that . Abu Ghaith entered the country illegally from Iran on a fake passport . and was ordered to be deported. As a result of that ruling, Abu Ghaith . was seized in Jordan by CIA agents while en route to Kuwait. Ghaith . had been considered 'stateless' since since he lost his Kuwaiti . citizenship after videos emerged showing him praising the September 11 . attacks. However, Turkish officials refused to confirm Ghaith's deportation or his capture in Jordan to The Associated Press. In Amman, the Jordanian capital, a security official said he had no information on the CIA arrest. U.S. intelligence officials in Washington did not immediately respond to request for information about Ghaith either. 'I trust he received a vigorous interrogation, and will face swift and certain justice,' King added.","Al Qaeda spokesman Sulaiman Abu Ghaith pleaded not guilty in federal court on Friday .

"It is well known that we eat with our eyes as well as our stomach, however one French supermarket is attempting to re-educate our perspectives on lumpy, ugly, misshapen fruit and vegetables with a new initiative. The third largest supermarket chain in France Intermarché, launched a campaign earlier this year that sought to put an end to food waste. Inglorious Fruits and Vegetables celebrates the 'ugly' produce that is often thrown away by growers and considered unfit for consumption. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . French supermarket Intermarché has launched the initiative Inglorious Fruits and Vegetables in order to combat food waste . Intermarché . wanted to help prevent food waste by proving to customers that unattractive fruits and vegetables are . just as delicious as their pristine counterparts. The campaign follows the news that we throw 300 million tons of food away each year, encouraging the European Union to make 2014 the year against food waste. The campaign by Intermarché is supported by advertising agency Marcel who, with the help of  photographer Patrice de Villiers, produced seven posters starring the unattractive produce to go alongside it. The posters included images of the grotesque apple, the ridiculous potato, the hideous orange, the failed lemon, the disfigured eggplant, the ugly carrot, and the unfortunate clementine. For de Villiers the most important part of the process was giving character to the greens. She told the Fast Company: 'The most vital element was ensuring the ""strange but lovable"" theme shone through I spent time observing our uglies trying to find the precise . angle which showed both their ""ugliness"" and their loveliness, finding . their unique character.' The supermarket gave the vegetables their own aisle, with the produce working out about 30 per cent cheaper . The supermarket created the project following the European Union's initiative to make 2014 the year against food waste . She added that this was a subject that was particularly important to her. 'It's the taste that matters. Given the vast amount of fresh produce needlessly thrown away, the . sooner more supermarkets implement something like the Intermarché . strategy the better.' As well as the posters Intermarché gave the produce their own aisle in the supermarket, buying the fruit and veg that farmers would usually throw away which saw the goods going for 30 per cent cheaper than others on offer. To begin with the unwanted cast-offs didn't prove vastly popular so the supermarket, determined to prove they were just as flavoursome as those we would usually buy, produced soups and juices with the fruit and veg for customers to try. The result was a huge success: all stocks of the fruit and vegetables sold out in an initial rush and supermarket traffic overall increased by 24 per cent. To prove that the fruit and veg was just as consumable despite their mishaps the supermarket offered out soups and juices made from the produce . The project has been as huge success with the first two days of trading seeing an average of 1.2 tonnes of the fruits and vegetables being sold in store .","Intermarché launched Inglorious Fruits and Vegetables earlier this year .

"Obama is on Martha's Vineyard while Iraq undergoes regime change and terrorists slaughter ethnic and religious minorities . Calling heads of state to lobby participation in humanitarian assistance program – in between golf and fundraising . Washington Post columnist wrote that the president 'risks fueling the impression that he is detached as the world burns' French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius has a message about Iraq for Barack Obama: Get back to the White House and do something. 'I know it is the holiday period in our Western countries,' Fabius told a radio interviewer Tuesday in France,' but when people are dying, you must come back from vacation.' Full-time workers in France are guaranteed a whopping five weeks of paid vacation every year, making his plea all the more urgent. Obama is on a family and golfing holiday in a ritzy neighborhood of Martha's Vineyard but says he will come back to Washington this weekend before returning on Tuesday to fun, sun, and more golf. French Foreign Affairs Minister Laurent Fabius (C) visited Iraqi refugees in Nineveh province on Sunday, saying upon his return to France that vacations for certain world leaders should cease while people are dying there . What a putt: Obama risks looking aloof as Iraq burns . As town after Iraqi town is conquered by ISIS, an Islamist terror group that claims it has established an 'Islamic state,' Obama's approach has consisted so far of airlifting humanitarian supplies to victimized groups, protecting the aid drops with airstrikes, and begging for help from allies. Britain, France, Italy and other European nations have backed the humanitarian assistance with material and personnel, reported The Wall Street Journal, which first broke news of the French diplomat's criticism. Meanwhile Obama and Vice President Joe Biden have been encouraging a nascent Iraqi government from a safe distance, while assuring Americans that the U.S. won't enter another prolonged war with boots on the ground. Eyebrows went up Wednesday in Washington, though, when the White House announced that Obama was leaning toward deploying ground troops to Mount Sinjar, a northern Iraqi hideout to which tens of thousands of Yadizis, a persecuted religious minority group, have led from ISIS. Deputy press spokesman Eric Schultz told reporters that the president would green-light such an operation, led by U.S. Marines, if commanders in the field recommended it. Less than four hours later, reporters observed troops landing on the mountaintop. Obama, deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said Wednesday, is 'open to recommendations in which the United States is helping to facilitate the removal of these people from the mountain on a humanitarian mission.' That rescue mission, he told reporters, 'is separate than saying U.S. forces are going to be redeployed in Iraq in a combat role to take the fight to [ISIS].' Despite a busy series of negotiations and decision-trees, and the looking possible collapse of Iraq, Obama remains on vacation. Fabius (L), like Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry, are urging Iraqi leaders to form an inclusive government that could reduce sectarian tensions -- but he's doing it alongside Iraqi Deputy PM Hussain al-Shahristani, not from a beach villa . Missing in Washington: Hero worship, Massachusetts vacation style -- A crowd gathered to vie for a glimpse of Obama as he arrived for dinner at a Martha's Vineyard restaurant on Tuesday . He has logged barely one-third as many vacation days as President George . W. Bush did, but the timing of is being called into question. 'Even presidents need down time, and Obama can handle his commander-in-chief duties wherever he is,' Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank wrote on Monday. 'But his decision to proceed with his getaway just 36 hours after announcing the military action in Iraq risks fueling the impression that he is detached as the world burns.' Since the communications and war apparatus of the commander-in-chief travels wherever the president goes, Obama can conduct matters of state from a Masachusetts vacation island almost as easier as he can from the Oval Office. So reasons for his planned return to Washington on Tuesday, while it may please the French, remain a mystery.","Obama is on Martha's Vineyard while Iraq undergoes regime change and terrorists slaughter ethnic and religious minorities .

"Alistair Darling has warned Scots not to be bullied into a Yes vote, as thousands marched in Glasgow attacking the BBC’s ‘biased’ coverage of the referendum. The former Labour chancellor, leader of the pro-union Better Together campaign, claimed he had felt ‘menaced’ during the campaign, saying: ‘I have been involved in political campaigning for about 35 years and I have never seen anything like this before.’ He added: ‘I think we will win as I don’t think Scotland is going to get bullied into accepting something it doesn’t want.’ Scroll down for video . Yes campaigners stage a march towards the BBC Scotland headquarters in Glasgow   to protest against alleged biased by the BBC in its coverage of the Scottish independence referendum . Yes campaigners took to the BBC's Scottish HQ after a clash between Alex Salmond and BBC political editor Nick Robinson, who was accused of 'heckling' the First Minister . His comments came as it emerged that all police leave had been cancelled for the day of the vote, with polling staff warned to expect ‘confrontational behaviour’. Almost 3.5million people will attend polling stations on Thursday – with staff told to prepare for ‘serious disturbances’. In recent weeks the debate reached boiling point, after abuse, vandalism and threats of violence were doled out by both sides. And yesterday up to 1,000 nationalists marched through Glasgow with placards attacking the BBC’s Nick Robinson. Mr Salmond dodged the political editor’s question at a press conference last week, then accused him of ‘heckling’. Independence activists at the meeting applauded Mr Salmond and shouted ‘biased BBC’. Gathering: The police estimated that up to 1,000 people had attended the demonstration in Glasgow . Anger: Scottish nationalists believe the BBC has given a one-sided view of the debate . Mr Robinson was later accused by Yes campaigners of producing an ‘inaccurate’ report about the confrontation and yesterday Mr Salmond said the BBC was ‘absolutely’ biased. Radio 2 DJ Ken Bruce today risked fanning the flames of the debate by playing Al Green's 1972 hit Let's Stay Together - one Scottish fan tweeted that it was a 'hidden message', although the Glaswegian Mr Bruce has not publicly commented on the referendum. However, a BBC spokesman defended their coverage, calling it ‘rigorously impartial’. Yesterday Mr Salmond admitted that there would not be another referendum on separation for a generation – but with polls indicating strongest support for No among the over-60s, he claimed Scotland would eventually break away from the UK whatever the vote’s outcome. He declared: ‘There isn’t so much as a No vote in Scotland – only deferred Yesses.’ Fury: Demonstrators held up placards denouncing the BBC's coverage over the past few months . Tense: The protest came after weeks of anger over alleged bias in the BBC . Reaction: Unionists accused the protesters of focussing on irrelevant issues in the run-up to the vote . And despite polls indicating that the race is still too close to call, Mr Salmond promised a ‘day of celebration’ after a Yes vote and invited Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling to join ‘Team Scotland’ to negotiate the end of the Union. But Mr Darling claimed Scotland’s fate now lies in the hands of around 500,000 undecided voters, before accusing Mr Salmond of embarking on a ‘premature victory lap’. And on his tenth campaign visit to Scotland today, David Cameron will warn voters that there will be ‘no way back’ if they choose to leave the UK, calling the vote ‘a once-and-for-all decision’.","Nationalists march on Glasgow with placards attacking BBC political editor .

"This is the cringe-worthy moment former Florida Governor Charlie Crist blundered in on an interview  just as his political rival, Lieutenant Governor Carlos Lopez-Canteraas, was accusing him of being willing to betray voters with false promises. Crist was elected as Republican governor of the sunshine state in 2007, but became an independent in 2010. After his term ended in 2011 he switched sides and is now running for office as a . Democrat. Speaking to the media at the Forum Club of the Palm Beaches where Crist had just kicked-off his re-election campaign, Lopez-Canteraas was in the middle of a scathing attack on his one-time colleague. Scroll down for video . Awkward: Florida's Lieutenant Governor Carlos Lopez-Canteraas, grits his teeth as political opponent Charlie Crist walks in at the moment he had been bad-mouthing him in an interview . 'Charlie's willing to say whatever . you want to hear to get elected,' he told the camera, 'But when it comes . down to the facts, down to the record'. At this moment, completely unbeknown to Lopez-Canteraas, Crist appears in the background and walks towards the group to say hello. Lopez-Canteraas continues: 'When it's time to stand up to make a difference, he left.' When Lopez-Canteraas . finally notices Crist is there he appears momentarily shocked but manages to . regain his composure to shake hands with his rival. Crist declined to respond to a question about Lopez-Cantera's comments about his speech's honesty. Attack: Lopez-Canteraas had just accused Crist of being willing to say anything to get elected . 'He's just gonna get to debate the lieutenant governor candidate,' Crist said. 'Give me Scott.' Lopez-Cantera said: 'I feel like I'm . watching a bad political movie. Charlie has become the unpleasant . stereotype of a politician willing to say anything and do anything to . further ambitions.' After . an unsuccessful campaign for U.S. Senate as a Republican, and then an . independent, Crist is now considered the front-runner for the Democratic . gubernatorial nomination. In his speech to the Forum Vlub, Crist heaped blistering criticism on current Governor Rick Scott faces from his likely opponent, portraying him as an opponent to education and the environment and a man out of touch with average Floridians. In his speech Crist had attacked Florida Governor Rick Scoot (pictured) over his wealth and business past . 'Gov. Scott has led like this: embrace the ideological fringe, take care of his friends, bully his opponents, hide from the public and the press and run from tough issues,' Crist said. 'He keeps running because the truth means little to Rick Scott because he doesn't have a record to run on, because he knows Floridians don't support him and that his priorities are wrong.' Crist gave a glimpse of his sometimes disarming friendliness, rising from his seat to applaud Lopez-Cantera when he was introduced, and actually praising him in his speech. In his 23-minute speech, Crist reached back to familiar jabs at Scott, repeatedly mentioning his wealth and questions about his business past, and going as far to suggest his race against the governor was a battle between good and evil. Former Republican Gov. Charlie Crist, who is running for the post as a Democrat in 2014, signs a copy of his book before a speaking event Monday. 'There's an old quote, ""All that is necessary for evil to prevail is for good people to do nothing,'' he said. Crist attempted to portray himself as an everyday guy who has 'lived paycheck to paycheck' and still picks up his own dry cleaning, even as he has held high-profile jobs for years and is married to a multi-millionaire. He earned more applause, though, when he stepped back from his attacks on Scott to offer a litany of plans for the state. 'He calls for civility, yet his entire speech was attacking ... and insulting Gov. Scott,' Lopez-Cantera said. 'It's a lot of empty rhetoric and I've known Charlie for almost 20 years and I've come to expect that from him.'","Crist was elected as Republican .

"A father-of-three had his fingers broken as he was wrongly arrested in front of his partner and children for 'driving too slowly' past an airport. Andrew Sinclair, 47, was thrown in the cells and held for around three hours after being pulled over as he drove away from the terminal. The mechanic has now won compensation after a County Court jury ruled there had been no justification for detaining him outside Manchester Airport. Wrongful arrest: Andrew Sinclair, 47, was dragged out of his car for driving too slowly outside Manchester Airport while his partner Michelle Sadoo watched . Mr Sinclair, from Stockport, was stopped because he was not driving quickly enough as he waited for his partner Michelle Saddoo, 40, to catch up in another car as he collected his son. As the father explained the situation . to the motorcycle officer, police from a nearby Tactical Aid Unit - . which had been called to manage an immigration protest at the airport - . became involved in the dispute in March 2009. The father was pushed to the ground by around . half-a-dozen officers and arrested in front of his partner and their children before being taken to a police station. Officers later claimed he had been arrested for a breach of the peace outside Terminal Two. But a jury at Manchester County Court ruled there had been no justification for detaining him. Mr Sinclair said: 'As soon as the Tactical Aid Unit officers came over they seemed to have adopted an aggressive, bullying attitude and started searching the car and pushing me around before they threw me to the floor. Detained: Mr Sinclair was driving slowly in the arrivals area waiting for his partner to catch up when he was arrested . Battle: Mr Sinclair was arrested in 2009 and has now won a four-year legal fight for compensation . 'They never explained to me that I'd been arrested and they just locked me up, then a few hours later they released me without any explanation. I knew what had happened wasn't right and that night I decided I was going to fight it. 'I'm just a normal person and for four years this has always been at the back of my mind and caused me a lot of stress but it was something I didn't want to just let go, because they abused their power and like anyone else the police need to be held to account.' Mr Sinclair was collecting his son, Reis, and the 23-year-old's Honda Civic car as he was unable to drive himself home after suffering head injuries, a broken wrist and broken collarbone in a motoring accident while on holiday in Dubai. Ms Saddoo was supposed to be driving the family car home with their two young children Aliyah, three, and four-month-old Tayo in the back seat. She said: 'We were just a normal, everyday family going about our normal, everyday business and there was no reason whatsoever for them to behave in the way they did. Anger: Andrew Sinclair, of Stockport, has finally won compensation fro wrongful arrest after a four-year legal battle . 'It's affected us all deeply, my daughter in particular had nightmares and would have screaming fits every time she saw a police officer. 'It took a lot of courage to take on Greater Manchester Police but we knew that what happened was wrong and as citizens we shouldn't have to accept that. 'We've had great support from our friends and family and our legal team, and in the end it's a great vindication that a jury was able to see the truth and that we finally have justice.' Following a seven-day trial the jury ruled that Mr Sinclair had been assaulted and falsely imprisoned but did not uphold an allegation that officers had deliberately caused the injuries to his fingers. A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said: 'Greater Manchester Police notes the decision of the jury to award compensation to Mr Sinclair after he was successful in his claim that he was unlawfully detained for two hours and 42 minutes as a result of a wrongful arrest following an incident that took place on 21 March 2009. 'The Force fully respects the decision reached by the court and Mr Sinclair has been compensated accordingly. 'Greater Manchester Police also notes that Mr Sinclair's claims for loss of earnings and that one of the officers involved deliberately caused personal injury were dismissed.' The amount of compensation was not revealed. Juries are rarely used in the County Court, but can be used in false imprisonment cases.","Andrew Sinclair, 47, was dragged from his car by six police officers .

"Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld says he has 'no idea' whether his tax returns and payments are accurate. Rumsfeld made the claims in a letter that was sent to the IRS and shared on Twitter on Tuesday - and says he sends the same letter to the agency every year. He also says he doesn't even know if earlier tax documents are accurate for him and his wife. 'I have sent in our federal income tax and our gift tax returns for 2013,' it reads. 'As in prior years, it is important for you to know that I have absolutely no idea whether our tax returns and our tax payments are accurate. I say that despite the fact that I a college graduate and I try hard to make sure our tax returns are accurate.' 'I have no absolutely no idea if my taxes are accurate': Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld made the claims in a letter shared on Twitter on Tuesday . Rumsfeld's letter later criticizes the perceived complexity of the US tax system. 'The tax code is so complex and the forms are so complicated, that I know I cannot have any confidence that I know what is being requested and therefore I cannot and do not know, as I suspect a great many Americans cannot know, whether or not their tax returns are accurate,' he writes. Confused? Rumsfeld said he didn't even know if tax returns and payments from prior years were accurate . He later adds, 'This note is to alert you folks that I know that I do not know whether or not my tax returns are accurate, which is a sad commentary on governance in our nation’s capital.' Elsewhere in the letter, Rumsfeld, 81, says that he hopes the tax code will be simplified before he dies. 'I do hope that at some point in my lifetime, and I am now in my 80s, so there are not many years left, the U.S. government will simply the U.S. tax code so that those citizens who sincerely want to pay what they should, are able to do it right, and know that they have done it right.' Online commenters have criticized Rumsfeld's letter on the social media platform - and one user has even alleged Rumsfeld committed perjury by submitting the tax documents. '""No idea?"" So you both committed perjury when you declared it was true to the best of your knowledge,' the user says. 'Protip: IRS doesn't write the tax code, Congress does,' one user wrote. 'Accuracy is a tricky thing isn't it? A bit like the evidence for Weapons of Mass Destruction,' another commenter wrote. 'Considering you claim to not know what constitutes torture, I think we all have a little trouble believing you,' one user said. 'They're going to the debt you crated [sic] with Iraq war. And why aren't you in jail?' another said.","Rumsfeld made the claims in a letter shared on Twitter on Tuesday .

Before the annual parade got under way at 9am, some 50 people gathered outside the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue carrying signs and chanting ‘No Justice! No peace!' and ‘Justice for Mike Brown!’ The group protesting the grand jury decision not to indict Officer Darren Wilson in the August killing of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson walked down Fifth Avenue towards 37th Street, but then tried to enter the parade route on Sixth Avenue. When officers posted along the street told the demonstrators that they were not allowed to be there, tempers flared and some of the marchers reportedly started pushing against NYPD barricades. One of the marchers was arrested after he allegedly flipped over a trash can. The station WNYW also reported that someone tossed an object from a building overlooking the parade path.

'With this hands-off approach (by police), it gives (protesters) free rein to do anything they want,' a law enforcement source told The Post. 'It’s a free pass to act like a fool.' One group marched to Times Square, with police officers on their heels keeping tabs on the situation while avoiding confrontations. The protesters disrupted traffic on the FDR Drive and gathered at the entrances to the Williamsburg and Manhattan bridges, as well as the Queens Midtown Tunnel. Commissioner Bratton said that his officers were giving demonstrators 'breathing room' to air their grievances. . 'As long as they remain nonviolent, and as long as they don't engage in issues that cause fear or create vandalism, we will work with them to allow them to demonstrate,' he said.","Seven demonstrators were arrested for trying to enter the parade path on Sixth Avenue .

"US Airways has profusely apologized after an extremely graphic picture of a woman engaged in a sex act with a model Boeing 777 was tweeted to a customer who complained about her Spring Break flight. The young woman, Alex, tweeted directly to US Airways early on Monday morning that her flight to Portland had been delayed - demanding 'free stuff' because her vacation was off to a bad start. In reply, the airlines official Twitter account replied, 'We don’t like to hear this, Alex.  Please provide feedback to our Customer Relations team here,' and attached a photograph of the nude woman out to its 418,000 followers this afternoon. Scroll down for video . Graphic: US Airways has apologized after their official Twitter account tweeted an extremely inappropriate photo (which MailOnline has blanked over) on Monday afternoon . US Airways have not explained why the photograph was sent out, but have offered a sincere and full apology. 'We apologize for an inappropriate image recently shared as a link in one of our responses. We’ve removed the tweet and are investigating.' Of course the tweet was deleted but spent 22 minutes online - enough time to cause a frenzy of sharing among incredulous users of the social media app. When reached for comment, US Airways admited they were aware of the situation but could not explain it as of Monday afternoon. Incredulous: The public's reaction to US Airways staggering tweet ranged from humor to sympathy for whoever was responsible . The replies to the offensive tweet ranged from laughter to outrage. It seems the tweet was originally sent as a bad joke to American Airlines and presumably someone at US Airways tried to copy and paste it to send to a friend, but inadvertently tweeted it out to genuine customers. Another unsatisfied customer: US Airways sent the same picture to customer Elle Rafter after she complained about her late flight to Portland . So so sorry: US Airways rushed to control the damage from their outrageous tweet - but the damage was done . It also appears that US Airways tweeted the photo to multiple customers as their bungled response to the original tweet continued.

Airways use the same social media tool, SNAP100. The timing was particularly amusing since it overlapped with the announcement of the Pulitzer Prize winners and gained more traffic online. The tweet is even more embarrassing for US Airways as they prepare for their merger with American Airlines which will create the world's largest airline company. US Airways eventually said sorry in full for the gross error. 'We apologize for the inappropriate image we recently shared in a Twitter response.

"We all know someone who tweets about the minute details of their life every 10 minutes and now new research suggests that are displaying narcissistic tendencies. U.S. researchers claim narcissists tweet more often than others and crave followers on Twitter to meet their need for approval. They also found that narcissists update their Facebook status more regularly and vain adults prefer to post content on Facebook, rather than Twitter. U.S. researchers found that people with narcissistic tendencies like to cultivate a large following on Twitter to meet their need for approval. Celebrities including Miley Cyrus regularly share their activities on the social network . A study by the University of Michigan that was published in June, found that middle-aged narcissists are more likely to frequently update their Facebook status, while their younger counterparts take to Twitter to satisfy their vanity. According to Elliot Panek, middle-aged people use Facebook as a way of gaining approval of their image from their peers, while college students prefer Twitter because they over-value their own opinions. He said: 'Middle-aged adults usually have already formed their social selves, and they use social media to gain approval from those who are already in their social circles.' According to the study, Twitter acts as a megaphone for younger web users. Mr Panek said: 'Through Twitter they're trying to broaden their social circles and broadcast their views about a wide range of topics and issues.' Shaun Davenport of High Point University, North Carolina, told Pacific Standard: ‘Narcissism does appear to be a primary driver for the desire for (Twitter) followers, which in turn drives tweets.’ He found that students with narcissistic tendencies tend to prefer to tweet to attract attention and consequently like to have as many followers as possible. However, adult narcissists prefer to post their news on Facebook, suggesting a generational divide, according to the study in the journal Computers in Human Behaviour. The research found Millennials (people born between the early 1980s to the early 2000s) post Facebook statuses more regularly and are less likely to reflect narcissistic motives. Adult narcissists prefer to post their news on Facebook while Millennial's status updates are less likely to reflect narcissistic tendencies, according to the study . Together with his colleagues, he conducted an online survey of 515 college students and 669 adults, all of whom embraced social media. They filled out a survey rating their narcissistic tendencies and said how many times they tweeted and updated their Facebook status on a typical day. Narcissism was found to be ‘a stronger predictor of Twitter active usage than Facebook active usage,’ according to the study. Narcissism was found to be 'a stronger predictor of Twitter active usage than Facebook active usage,' according to the study . ‘We found no significant direct or indirect relationship with active usage on Facebook for the college students,’ the researchers said. However, they did find that narcissism was linked to Facebook activity among adults, suggesting that narcissists on the social network are more likely to be of Generation X or baby boomers than Millennials. They believe this could be because Millennials partly grew up using Facebook to communicate with others, just as previous generations used a phone. However, older people who have gained access to the tool need more reason to post a status update and narcissism is one of the reasons to do so.","Study by High Point University, North Carolina, said narcissism appears to be a primary driver for the desire for Twitter followers .

"Cat killer: Andrew Beese on his way to Cheltenham Magistrates court where he was jailed for 14 weeks . A man who stabbed his wife’s cat to death after a drunken row, claiming he 'feared for his life' when it scratched him, was jailed for 14 weeks today. Andrew Beese, 60, brutally knifed the cat called Koko in his kitchen and was seen throwing it around the room. He then tossed the blood-soaked body over the fence at the bottom of his garden and set about cleaning the blood from the kitchen. Beese later told police the animal - which was nursing 12-week-old kittens - had 'gratuitously attacked him' and he feared it would do so again. He was jailed at Cheltenham Magistrates Court yesterday after being convicted of causing undue suffering to a protected animal. The court heard how the incident happened after Helen stormed out of their home in Stroud, Glos., after an argument. In a witness statement, neighbour Sarah Tanner reported hearing loud bangs coming from the property about 4pm on December 29 last year. Miss Tanner’s home looks directly onto Beese’s property, allowing her a direct view into his kitchen. RSPCA prosecutor Nick Sutton said: 'She could see he had his back to the window, and was jumping up and down. 'She couldn’t see what he was taking his temper out on but could see he was angry. 'She then saw a cat jump up to the window. She saw him make stabbing motions towards the cat. 'She saw him shake the cat around in the air by the scruff of the neck.' At this point Miss Tanner called the RSPCA cruelty hotline and police raced to the address. Beese returned to the kitchen with cleaning products and began trying to remove blood from the walls and surfaces. When police arrived they found significant amounts of blood on his trousers and in the kitchen. At . the time, Beese admitted to killing the cat, but said he had strangled . it and not stabbed it - the autopsy found no evidence of strangulation. Beese brutally knifed the cat called Koko in his kitchen and was seen throwing it around the room after a row with his wife Helen, left. He then tossed the body over the fence at the bottom of his garden, right . According to Mr Sutton, Beese told officers: 'I want it dead. It attacked me so I killed it.' He added: 'The defendant mentioned that the animal had gratuitously attacked him and that he feared for his life.' Magistrates were shown pictures of small scratches on Beese, which were consistent with cat scratches but in no way life-threatening. Mr Sutton added: 'The prosecution case is he simply killed this animal out of spite.' The vet who performed an autopsy reported that the blade was plunged into the side of the cat so hard it reached Koko’s heart and severed her aorta. Reaction: Mrs Beese was removed from Cheltenham Magistrates' Court  for disrupting events. She yelled: 'My husband is a sick man and does not know his actions' Steve Woodward, defending, said Beese has bipolar disorder and has issues with alcohol. He added: 'On that day in question he had drunk a lot.' In a bizarre turn of events yesterday, Beese’s wife Helen was removed from the court by an order from the magistrates for disrupting events. Several times she shouted: 'I’m his wife, this shouldn’t be happening.' She also yelled: 'My husband is a sick man and does not know his actions and I will believe that until the day I die.' Beese was also banned from keeping animals for 20 years. Chair of the Bench Peter Langman told him: 'Your actions clearly resulted in the death of an animal which is a protected animal. 'Therefore we are available to give a sentence higher than 18 weeks, but because you have pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity we are going to impose 14 weeks in custody.' After the sentencing, RSPCA inspector Philip Mann said: 'I would certainly put this case in the top ten worst cases in my career of 21 years. 'The fact that there is a prison sentence for this offence sends out a very strong message to people who think it is permissible to do this sort of thing.'","Andrew Beese, 60, brutally knifed the cat in his kitchen and was seen throwing it around the room after a drunken row with his wife Helen .

"The multi-million pound redevelopment of the Battersea Power Station will include a viewing platform in one of the chimneys and a roof garden, it has been revealed. Plans released by developers this week ahead of a period of public consultation show the £750million renovation will feature a huge 90,000 sq ft, or 460ft by 200ft, garden. There will also be an observation platform at the top of . one of the building's four chimneys, providing panoramic views across London. Space: The development will see large areas of public green space created in the surrounding areas as well as the 90,000 sq ft roof garden, both pictured . Far from faded: The old turbine hall, pictured, will be converted into a space for small independent shops and businesses . The redevelopment will also see the creation of 200 shops, 240 apartments and office space to be used by media, design and creative industries. The residential apartments and . penthouses are to be built on higher floors to command the all- important Thames-side views. The . shops, in the old boiler house space and on lower levels, . will be mainly independent stores - intentionally casting aside larger chains. Full of light: The building will have large windows providing plenty of natural light . Rebirth: The latest plans for the £750m renovation, artists impressionof the entire development pictured, have been released ahead of a week-long consultation period . The detailed designs have been created by Wilkinson Eyre Architects, who have worked closely with a number of stakeholders, including English Heritage and Wandsworth Borough Council, throughout the process. Many of the original art deco features, including parquet flooring, ornate ceilings and even power switches, will . remain in both Battersea A station, designed in the 1930s by Giles . Gilbert Scott, and in Battersea B, built in the 1950s as . an extension. Scott also designed the Bankside power station - home to the Tate Modern - and the red telephone box. Snapped up: In January, buyers were invited to invest in 800 of the 3,400 new homes to be built on the Battersea Power Station complex, one example pictured . Changes: The overall redevelopment of the iconic building is being overseen by Rafael Vinoly - who designed the 'Walkie Talkie' building . Rob Tincknell, chief executive of Battersea Power Station Development Company, said: 'It’s really important to everyone involved in this incredible project that we get the restoration and future use of the power station exactly right. 'We feel that what we are proposing retains and respects the integrity of this historic landmark whilst also creating vibrant living, working and recreational space that this part of London needs.' The latest plans are just part of a huge redevelopment of the entire . Battersea complex, which will include more homes, offices and . shops on the unused land. Rafael Viñoly designed the mixed-use masterplan, which includes more than 3,400 new homes as well as offices, shops, restaurants, bars, cafes, hotels, community and leisure space and 18 acres of open space. Development: Vinoly's masterplan will see the creation of new homes offices, shops, restaurants and hotels . Turbulent: Throughout the years Battersea Power Station, seen in the top left of this photo among many of London's top attracitions, has been rumoured to become a Disneyland, a nightclub and a football club . Last month, it was announced that Frank Gehry - regarded by many as the world’s most innovative architect - would jointly design part of the landmark project with British architect Lord Foster. In January, buyers were invited to register their interest in some 800 of the site's apartments, some of which cost up to £6million for a penthouse suite. The power station has seen a series of unsuccessful redevelopment efforts since it was de- commissioned thirty years ago. In 1987, work began on an indoor theme park, but soon stopped due to costs.

"It's the elegant car that suggests a cool, calm and sophisticated driver. However, it would appear that not every owner of an Aston Martin is as poised as 007 - as one motorist proved after he flooded his £150,000 car. This dozy driver had a soggy Christmas after he drove into floodwater which swamped his brand new vehicle. Water was seen dripping across its white leather seats and back seat TV screens after the motorist drove through the water . The four-door supercar broke down as the motorist tried to travel home through a flooded street in Maidstone . The vehicle was removed after the mechanic and the owner struggled to open the electric bonnet . The four-door supercar broke down as the motorist tried to travel home through a flooded street in Maidstone, Kent, on Christmas Day. Water, up to four-feet high in places, caused the electrics in the luxury Aston Martin Rapide to cut out, meaning the driver had no choice but to abandon his flashy motor. The vehicle was stuck and water was seen dripping across its white leather seats and back seat TV screens. The owner, who asked not to be named, said: ;I was just trying to get home and it conked out.I thought I'd be okay, but I wasn't. 'It's alright though, it's only a car. I'm fine, and nobody was hurt - that's the main thing.' The cream leather interior of the supercar seemed remarkably dry, despite water reaching up over the wheel arches . Aston Martin has won worldwide fame as a great British brand that oozes class - not rainwater . After the floods, an electrical fault caused the windows to open, letting more water pour inside . Resident Adam French, 25, witnessed the whole scene from his flat overlooking the flooded street. He said: 'That guy had no chance. I reckon the air intake must be pretty low on that car, and the whole thing just shut down. 'After a while, the windows opened, which was pretty funny, because some kids got into the car. 'He didn't seem too bothered, which was a bit strange.' The vehicle was removed on Thursday afternoon, after the mechanic and the owner struggled to open the electric bonnet because the luxury car's bonnet was flat.

The cream leather interior of the super car seemed remarkably dry, despite water reaching up over the wheel arches . Water was seen dripping off the televisions on the back of the front seats . Aston Martin has won worldwide fame as a great British brand that oozes class, sophistication and performance. Like many of Britain's great car-making names Aston Martin has changed hands numerous times over the years, however, it has not been plain sailing for Aston in recent years. At the tail-end of last year, takeover talk dominated after a slowdown in sales. Kuwaiti groups Investment Dar and Adeem Investment Co bought Aston Martin five years ago for around £500million from US car giant Ford, which had controlled the brand since 1987. In December, it received a £150million cash injection from European investment group Investindustrial, giving it a 37.5 per cent stake in the business. The arrival of the Italian-based investment group followed news that Aston Martin’s sales had tumbled 20 percent to 2,520 vehicles in the first nine months of 2012. Aston Martin said the money would help deliver on a bright future tapping into rising global demand for luxury cars and, ‘proceed with its extensive and exciting plans for long-term growth and take on rivals like Porsche and Ferrari’.","Water, up to four-feet high in places, caused the electrics in the luxury Aston Martin Rapide to cut out as the driver drove through Kent ."
"Alex Salmond is demanding a £10 billion carve-up of Britain’s Armed Forces – including aircraft, ships and the transfer of up to 9,200 regular and Special Forces troops – if Scotland votes for independence. The Scottish National Party leader insists his country’s share of the UK’s military assets should be handed over free of charge so his government can form its own navy, air force and army. But last night, experts said his asset-stripping of Britain’s Armed Forces would severely damage the UK’s military capability. Scroll down for video . From the British Army, the SNP wants three infantry battalions, including the Royal Highland Fusiliers (pictured) They also believe that Scotland would struggle to defend itself on the SNP’s proposed annual defence budget of £2.5 billion. Policy documents reveal the full inventory of supersonic jets, fully armed warships and army battalions the Scottish nationalists expect to get their hands on if there’s a ‘Yes’ vote this Thursday – with the Royal Navy facing the heaviest losses. From the current fleet – already the smallest in the Navy’s 500-year history – they want two fully armed Type 23 frigates, such as the Scottish-named HMS Argyll and HMS Sutherland, four anti-mine vessels, two offshore patrol vessels, up to six patrol boats and a number of auxiliary support ships. The SNP also says it needs 2,000 regular sailors and 200 reservists and expects the Royal Navy to provide most of these personnel. Alex Salmond is demanding a £10 billion carve-up of Britain’s Armed Forces – including aircraft, ships and the transfer of up to 9,200 regular and Special Forces troops . The nationalists also expect the Royal Air Force to provide ‘most of the equipment’ needed to get Scotland’s air force off the ground. This raises the prospect of the RAF supplying up to 12 Typhoon combat jets, six Hercules transport aircraft and a squadron of up to ten support helicopters such as Chinooks and Sea Kings. The RAF is also expected to provide personnel to help the SNP reach its target of 2,000 regular airmen and 300 reservists. From the British Army, the SNP wants three infantry battalions – with the Scottish-raised Black Watch, Royal Highland Fusiliers and The Highlanders most likely to go – and other units too. Included on the party’s shopping list are two light armoured reconnaissance units, two light artillery units, engineering and aviation units, as well as troops expert in areas such as communication, transport, logistics and medical services. The Scottish National Party leader insists his country’s share of the UK’s military assets should be handed over free of charge so his government can form its own navy, air force and army . UK Defence chiefs are already committed to spending £36 million in golden-handcuffs payments in a bid to keep highly skilled personnel. But with the SNP pledging to improve soldiers’ terms and conditions, experts said the enticements might amount to ‘bribes for troops’. Professor Malcolm Chambers said: ‘You could get issues of competition between the Scottish and British forces.’ Special Forces and explosives and ordnance personnel would be handed over too. The SNP says that to recruit the 3,500 regular troops and 1,200 reservists it requires, it will negotiate with the Ministry of Defence. But Mr Salmond’s plans came under attack last night from a former head of the Royal Navy, Lord West, who said: ‘These reductions to the Royal Navy, the Royal Air Force and the British Army would have a major impact on the UK’s defensive capability. Our capability to defend the British Isles will be diminished and the Scots won’t have the ability either. We’ll all lose out. This is very damaging.’ How Scotland will establish its defence forces by 2016 – when independence would be declared in the event of a ‘Yes’ vote – was questioned by Professor Malcolm Chambers of the Royal United Services Institute. He said last night: ‘It is not realistic to manage all these capabilities by day one and how long it takes would rely on the level of UK support. While 9,000 troops sounds affordable it is not realistic to increase the numbers of personnel to 15,000 [the SNP’s ten-year target] on the same £2.5 billion annual budget.’ An MoD spokesman said: ‘Scotland is safer and better defended as part of the UK, protected by the full range of UK defence capabilities, and benefiting from the manpower, bases and military equipment that the Union provides.’ Scots 'MI6 will get just 720 spies to fight terror . By ROBERT VERKAIK FOR THE MAIL ON SUNDAY . An independent Scotland will leave the rest of the UK exposed to acts of terrorism from groups such as Islamic State, security experts warned last night. They say that on the day of independence Scotland will lose the services of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ and the rest of the UK’s intelligence-gathering operations. Its newly created Scottish security and intelligence agency is expected to be left with just 720 spies to defend the new state – and it will no longer be able to rely on the cooperation of the American agencies, who view Scotland with deep suspicion after the release of Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset al-Megrahi. An independent Scotland will leave the rest of the UK exposed to acts of terrorism from groups such as Islamic State, security experts warned . Alex Carlile QC, the former independent reviewer of anti-terrorism legislation, said: ‘There have been many terrorist issues which have been of shared interest to the police in Scotland, the UK and the various control authorities. It’s hard to imagine Scotland would be anything like as secure if it obtained independence. 'It would be very difficult for the new security agency because any serving security service personnel would be British and their contractual loyalties would be to the UK, not Scotland.’ Robin Simcox, an expert on the threat posed by Islamist extremists, said that there were ‘real concerns’ over how Scotland would be able to monitor returning jihadis. He said: ‘They will lose a lot of capability and as result the rest of the UK would be more vulnerable.’ Expert analysis by the Royal United Services Institute, Britain’s leading defence and security think-tank, concludes Scotland will be excluded from the ‘five eyes’ intelligence sharing programme of Britain, America, New Zealand, Australia and Canada. And former security minister Lord West warned that Britain and America could be forced to spy on Scotland, which will be considered an alien state. If Scotland doesn’t have the resources or wherewithal to guard against Islamic extremists who have returned from Syria and Iraq then the UK will have no choice but to treat Scotland as hostile. He said: ‘From the moment they separate they become a foreign country. As far as MI6 is concerned, they’re aliens. They haven’t thought this through. It’s deeply worrying.’","Alex Salmond wants aircraft, ships and the transfer of up to 9,200 regular and Special Forces troops if Scotland votes for independence .

"Fast-food giant McDonald’s has apologised for a recent advertisement which pokes fun at the haze of pollution which has covered Singapore. The ad used the acronym PSI, which usually stands for Pollutants Standards Index, to promote a new range of dipping sauces, giving it new meaning in the line ‘today’s Peak Sauce Index is looking deliciously high’. As Singaporeans choked on some of the worst air pollution in the country’s history, the ad was published in local newspapers, much to the dismay of many residents. 'Inappropriate' promotion: McDonald's has apologised for this ad which poked fun at the haze of pollution blanketing Singapore that appeared during the worst days of the smog, angering many . A McDonald’s spokesman said the advertisement was ‘not intended to trivialise the current haze situation’ and that it was a one-off promotion which was designed and assigned when the haze was not as bad. Considering that the situation had become a lot worse at the time of publication in mid-June, the spokesman admitted that the ad was ‘inappropriate’. She said: ‘We are truly sorry that it has led people to feel that way. ‘We share the concerns of Singaporeans and were equally surprised to see PSI levels hit record highs.’ One disgruntled consumer wrote on the McDonald’s Singapore Facebook page: ‘Not funny McDonald’s.’ Poked fun at haze: As Singaporeans choked on the country's worst ever air pollution (pictured), the McDonald's ad was published in local newspapers much to many residents' dismay .

Those measurements were classified as 'hazardous' and can aggravate respiratory ailments. Any reading above 200 is considered threatening to health.

Hospitals and clinics in areas badly affected by haze have recorded a rise of more than 100 per cent in asthma cases, along with a rise in respiratory problems and conjunctivitis. Singapore's Environment Minister Vivian Balakrishnan had urged Indonesia to take 'urgent and definitive action' to combat the pollution at its source. 'This is now the worst haze that Singapore has ever faced,' Mr Balakrishnan wrote on his Facebook page.

"A fantastic new Bel Air mansion has revealed a return to a trend of vast homes for the super rich - with some quirky added extras. Chateau Des Fleurs is a 60,000-square-foot giant in Bel Air spread over ten acres and is valued at $100million. It took more than five years to build it based on a classic French chateau style and includes such luxury amenities as a catering kitchen, a squash court and a salon. The fabulous home hits the market as part of a new trend by property developers to create a string of outrageous features including botox rooms in a bid to lure in wealthy buyers.

Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen's Brentwood mansion with a moat to separate them from the rest of the world . Supermodel Gisele Bundchen and New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady's Brentwood home . Architects are creating special rooms where A-listers can get the cosmetic treatment in the hope it will persuade them to pay tens of millions of dollars for the mansions. They are also including moats with bridges over them on the properties so that owners can feel like they are apart from the regular joes. One even has its own Intensive Care Unit that is behind a secret panel so that doctors can treat patients on site. The thinking is that the property owner - a wealthy and powerful businessman - is so important that if they were rushed to hospital the stock market would nosedive. The mega rich have long desired more extravagant features for their homes than the next person, but according to the Los Angeles Times, things have become even more ridiculous of late. Designer Steve Hermann, who is based in Beverly Hills and has worked on homes for the likes of Christina Aguilera, said that he included the botox room in a $65m mansion that does not even have a buyer yet. Christina Aguilera's fabulous mansion: 'Wraparound water features' are all the rage with architects building properties for the rich and famous .

The estate also includes another room with a dental chair so they can have their teeth whitened or touched up without going out the front door. Mr Hermann said: ‘The developer is trying to come up with something to set his house apart. ‘It remains to be seen if the buyer will actually use the amenities.’ Mr Hermann also built a home in Montecito, which sold in October for $12.9 million with the 3,000 wine cellar in a temperature-controlled space on one wall on the same level as the kitchen, effectively making it a gallery to show off during parties. He said: ‘People spend an infinite amount of money on wine. Why would you want it two floors underneath where you are? ‘They become like actual display rooms. Guests will come over and you'll show off your closets.’ Other homes in Malibu, which is home to dozens of celebrities, include ‘wellness suites’ so anyone from masseuses to hairdressers can treat celebrities in the comfort of their own homes.

Mr Bordewick said: ‘If the owner goes to the hospital, the stock market could crash and a company may flounder’. Celebrities have long gone for excess when it comes to their homes.

"Senior Conservatives are insisting that Scottish MPs should be banned from voting on tax, welfare and the NHS if more powers are handed to Edinburgh after a No vote. There is growing unrest in Westminster over the rapid timetable for ‘devo max’, which would see Scotland handed new powers over income tax and finance. The move – proposed by former prime minister Gordon Brown – was rapidly agreed by all Westminster parties last week in an attempt to counter a surge in support for independence. Scroll down for video . Former Tory Cabinet minister John Redwood said ‘palming England off’ with devolution to cities or regional government would not be enough if Scotland was granted 'devo max' But MPs are angry that their leaders signed up to the plan, insisting that it should only go ahead if Scottish MPs are thrown out of Westminster or if their voting rights are curtailed. The Tories are expected to propose a ‘grand committee’ of English MPs for matters only affecting England. A poll found 47 per cent of English voters support the idea, with nine per cent opposed, and there have been calls for a vote to settle the issue before next year’s General Election. Former Tory Cabinet minister John Redwood said ‘palming England off’ with devolution to cities or regional government would not be enough – and that only an English Parliament would do. Senior Tories including Chancellor George Osborne are said to be sympathetic to the idea. Ex-Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell told Sky News that letting Scottish and Welsh MPs continue to vote on England-only issues would probably be unsustainable under devo max. Labour politicians are also concerned about a Yes vote, as 40 of 59 Scottish MPs are Labour. If they were barred from finance votes, then a Labour government could struggle to pass legislation. Both former Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls have concerns over the future of a UK Parliament if Scotland is granted 'devo max' after a No vote . Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls is said to have told his shadow Cabinet colleagues: ‘If we give the whole tax-raising power to the Scottish Parliament, how can Scottish Labour MPs vote for a Labour budget in England?’ David Cameron faces a fight to stay in Downing Street if the Scots vote for independence. A group of Tory MPs are planning to gather the 46 names necessary to trigger a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister, and colleagues claim he would take defeat so keenly that he would step down after a Yes vote.","'Devo max' would see Scotland handed new powers over tax and finance .

"The first headquarters for the Metropolitan Police will be transformed into a five-star hotel - with £10,000-a-night rooms for VIPs - after the historic building was acquired by property developers. Great Scotland Yard, the precursor to the Met's current base at New Scotland Yard, was chosen to house the force in 1829 when it was established by law. The famous address was used by police until 1890, during which time they investigated notorious criminals such as Jack the Ripper, and featured in Charles Dickens's novels and Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes series. Exclusive address: Great Scotland Yard in Whitehall, pictured, is set to be converted into a £100million hotel . Historic: The Galliard Group has acquired a 125-year lease on the property . But now the site, which was rebuilt in Edwardian style in 1910, has been acquired on a 125-year lease by the Galliard Group, who plan to turn the Grade II-listed, seven-storey building into one of the capital's most expensive hotels. The new, £100million Great Scotland Yard will feature a total of 235 rooms, a grand entrance foyer, winter garden lounge, a restaurant, a cocktail bar, a library, a 120-seater main conference room, a ballroom and private dining rooms. A number of VIP suites are expected to sell at around £10,000 for a single night's stay when the hotel opens its doors in early 2016. Stephen Conway, chief executive of Galliard Group said: 'Our vision is to create one of London's most outstanding 5-star hotels. It really is a blue-chip building with grand architecture, a fascinating history and large dramatic interiors. 'The street is quiet and tranquil yet on the doorstep of London's most famous landmarks including Trafalgar Square, 10 Downing Street, the Mall and Buckingham Palace.' In 1829, Home Secretary Sir Robert Peel selected Great Scotland Yard as the headquarters of the newly founded Metropolitan Police force. The building's main entrance was at 4 Whitehall Place, but a public office was installed to the rear at 3-5 Great Scotland Yard, giving the headquarters their famous name. Address: The original building was used from 1829-1890 by the police, and was replaced with the current Edwardian construction in 1910 . It was here that the notorious Plaistow Marshes and Jack the Ripper crimes were investigated and Scotland Yard was made famous by novelists including Charles Dickens and Arthur Conan Doyle. In 1890 the police headquarters moved to a new location, which was named New Scotland Yard. The current Edwardian building was constructed on the site in 1910 and it served as the British Army Recruitment Office and Royal Military Police headquarters. Lord Kitchener famously told WWI recruits 'Your Country Needs You' and there were cells in the basement for Army deserters. It was also the scene of the famous IRA car bomb explosion on March 8, 1973, the IRA's first terrorist attack outside of Northern Ireland. In 1982 a refurbishment introduced a new atrium and the building later became the Ministry of Defence Library until 2004. It has most recently been used a storage base for the MoD but was also featured in the 2007 Keira Knightley film Atonement. Luxurious: The hotel, which is expected to open in 2016, will have 235 rooms, including some which will cost £10,000 to rent for a single night . Former life: The original Great Scotland Yard can be seen in this drawing. It was replaced by the current Edwardian structure in 1910 . London hotels have one of the world's highest occupancy rates of 81 per cent, compared to 79 per cent for Dubai and 78 per cent for Paris. But despite this, there is said to be an undersupply of five-star hotels in Whitehall and Westminster. Peter Wetherell, managing director of Wetherell Estates and a consultant on a number of major conversions, welcomed the announcement. He said: 'The government and diplomatic office buildings are more valuable as residential or hotel properties, and their sale or lease is a huge revenue generator for the government. 'The whole government quarter is changing, the Corinthia Hotel was once a government building, Admiralty Arch is being converted into a hotel and residences. Now the Scotland Yard headquarters is turning into a hotel.'","Great Scotland Yard was the original headquarters for the force in 1829 .

"Antonio Valencia is the latest player to join Manchester United's injury list. The Ecuador winger has tweaked a hamstring  and, although the injury is not too serious, it is expected to rule him out of Monday's game at West Bromwich Albion. The 29-year-old is understood to have picked up the strain during United's win over Everton on October 5, where he was replaced after 79 minutes by Marouane Fellaini. Antonio Valencia challenges Everton's Steven Pienaar during Manchester United's 2-1 win at Old Trafford . The Ecuadorian had just returned to the starting XI in place of the injured Ander Herrera . Antonio Valencia (hamstring) Paddy McNair (hamstring) Ander Herrera (rib) Chris Smalling (thigh) Jonny Evans (ankle) Ashley Young (groin) Phil Jones (hamstring) Jesse Lingard (knee) Michael Carrick (ankle) The injury will beg further questions in the United camp about what they are doing wrong in their pre-emptive work which is supposed to protect against soft-tissue injuries. New physio Matt Radcliffe started this week and he will be among staff being charged to find a solution by United boss Louis van Gaal. Defender Paddy McNair has a hamstring injury, Phil Jones is recovering from one picked up on England duty while Chris Smalling is edging back after his thigh strain. United have used 30 players in the Premier League already this season with injuries stretching the squad to its limit. Midfielder Michael Carrick is stepping up his recovery from ankle ligament damage and hopes to make the bench for the trip to The Hawthorns on Monday. England internationals Phil Jones (left) and Michael Carrick are just two of the  United players out injured . United had hoped to play Carrick in a behind-closed-doors friendly but may have to make do with practice games among themselves. Only Burnley have come forward so far. They have agreed to play a game at their Gawthorpe training ground on Friday morning, but the timing may not be not ideal for Carrick as it would allow just 72 hours recovery time ahead of the Albion fixture.

"Married men, is your significant other spending more and more time at work? Watch out because it could be a sign that she thinks your relationship is in trouble. A study found that women who fear their marriage is breaking down begin working longer hours as a 'form of insurance'. Scientists have worked out that for every 1 per cent increase in the risk of marital breakdown, they put in an extra twelve minutes a week. 'Form of insurance': Women who feel like their marriage is on the rocks spend longer in the office, a new study from LSE researchers claims . But the study also found that there is no strong evidence to suggest men do the same when a relationship is struggling. Berkay Ozcan and his colleagues at the London School of Economics used the 1996 legalisation of divorce in Ireland to calculate how subsequent marriage breakdown rates affected women’s participation in the workforce. 'We see women who are at a higher risk of divorce significantly increase how much they work. And it is not that women working outside the home are more likely to get divorced,' he said. 'Rather, faced with a rising probability of divorce, women work more, whether they ultimately separate or not. They are working as a form of insurance in case of divorce or in anticipation of it. Divorce is harder on women.' In Ireland, following the legalisation of divorce, non-religious married women increased how much they worked by about 18 per cent, compared to their churchgoing counterparts. Religious women were used as a control . group by the researchers because they were not affected by the new . divorce law - their rate of separation remained constant and their . divorce rate is marginal. Still holding the family together: Women¿s increased work outside the home was not compensated by either a decrease in domestic time spent on childcare or an increase in childrearing by father, the study also found . The . study using a national survey of almost 3,000 households also found . women’s increased work outside the home was not compensated by either a . decrease in domestic time spent on childcare or an increase in . childrearing by fathers. Working mothers may have to juggle more tasks than their husbands, but the long-held belief that women are better than men at multitasking is a myth, according to Swedish research. 'On the contrary, the results of our study show that men are better at multitasking than women,' Timo Maentylae, a psychology professor at Stockholm University, said. Men are sometimes better than women at handling multiple tasks simultaneously, but the performance gap is correlated to the female menstrual cycle, according to his study. Dr Ozcan, whose findings are published in the European Economic Review, said: 'Our results suggest women’s changing work patterns outside of the home were not accompanied by a decrease in specialisation of tasks within the home. 'Women who have secured their outside options, in case of divorce, may have done so, at least in the short run, at the expense of their leisure time and potentially their wellbeing.' After the legislation was introduced non religious women were 34 per cent more likely to divorce, and religious women just 7 per cent more likely. Dr Ozcan said it is unclear whether legalising divorce may have strengthened or weakened wives’ bargaining position within the marriage. He said: 'In the short run, women may be hurt more by the higher likelihood of divorce as they are often the weaker spouse financially and would suffer more from a divorce than men. 'In the longer run, however, they may actually adjust labour supply and strengthen outside options.' Commenting on the findings Ayesha Vardag, one of Britain's leading divorce lawyers, said: 'My own experience is that both men and women tend to work longer hours when they don't want to go home. 'This can be to avoid a partner with whom the relationship has become strained or painful, or to avoid the stresses of child-caring after an exhausting day at work. 'The corollary of that may be that while home life becomes less enticing, the independence of a career, and the sense of self-worth and being ones own person that working gives, becomes all the more important.'","Women who fear marriage breakdown work longer as a 'form of insurance' claims new research from the London School of Economics .

"A bus-sized satellite that is lost in space could break up and spark a devastating field of debris similar to that which hit Sandra Bullock and George Clooney in the film Gravity. The threat comes from the nine-metre wide Envisat satellite which lost contact with Earth in 2012 and now orbits under at an altitude of 491 miles (790km). Scientists believe there is a chance of collision with other satellites and debris during the 150 years it is expected to remain in space. But bringing the satellite back to Earth may prove too costly. A satellite which the European Space Agency lost contact with in 2012 could create a similar cloud of space debris which hit the International Space Station in the film 'Gravity' Each year, scientists believe two objects pass the 18,000lb satellite by within about 200m and other spacecraft have had to move out of Envisat’s path. It is possible that a collision with Envisat could lead to a chain reaction effect, known as the Kessler Syndrome, which refers to when a cloud of fast-moving debris causes other collisions. This is the type of a cloud that hit Bullock and Clooney during a spacewalk outside the International Space Station in the film Gravity. ‘The fact that Envisat is in a near-polar orbit doesn’t help, since its path intersects most satellites’ orbits nearly at right angles,’ said Professor George Fraser, Director of the University’s Space Research Centre. Envisat was originally designed to snap high-resolution photos of Earth for five years, but managed to last 10 years during its successful mission . In March 2002, the European Space Agency launched Envisat, an advanced polar-orbiting Earth observation satellite which provided measurements of the atmosphere, ocean, land, and ice. The satellite was originally designed to snap high-resolution photos of Earth for five years, but managed to last 10 years during its successful mission. Envisat  lost contact with Earth in 2012 and now orbits under at an altitude of 491 miles (790km). This altitude is where the greatest amount of space debris around the planet is found. ‘Imagine driving down the motorway and every so often a large truck cuts right across all four lanes right in front of you.’ Physics students at Leicester University claim it could make it difficult for future space missions to pass through the region of Envisat’s altitude, if the region becomes congested with space debris. The fourth-year students’ paper, De-orbiting Envisat, suggests that around 140kg of fuel would be needed to move the satellite to a point where it can naturally return to Earth within 25 years. The energy required to move the satellite 90km closer to the Earth was 2.7 billion joules – equivalent to an extra 143.1kg of hydrazine fuel, they found. It is estimated that there are as many as 370,000 pieces of space junk floating in Earth's orbit, travelling at speeds of up to 22,000 mph . This could be possible, according to the students, if two of the craft’s 80kg fuel tanks were replaced. But getting this fuel to the satellite in orbit would be a tall order due to the costs involved of such a mission. An average satellite launch costs hundreds of millions of pounds– with each kilogram of the satellite’s costing tens of thousands of pounds. ‘In the film, the cloud of space debris is caused by a missile which was supposed to destroy a non-operational satellite and sparks the chain reaction which eventually collides with Clooney and Bullock’s spacecraft. In real life this is very unlikely to happen,’ said physics student Katie Raymer, 22, from Whitstable. ‘Envisat orbits at an altitude where the amount of debris is greatest. So although it is unlikely to happen, de-orbiting Envisat is certainly worth considering.’ It is possible that a collision with Envisat could lead to a chain reaction known as the Kessler Syndrome, which refers to when a cloud of fast-moving debris causes other collisions. This is the type of a cloud that hit Sandra Bullock and George Clooney during a spacewalk outside the International Space Station in the film Gravity .","Satellite lost contact in 2012 and now orbits under an altitude of 491 miles .

"A drunk driver who killed a 57-year-old motorcyclist when he sped through a red light last year will only have to spend 120 days in prison - a light sentence that has infuriated the victim's already heartbroken family. Ronald O'Kelly, 25, plead guilty to charges of involuntary vehicular manslaughter due to intoxication and fleeing the scene on Friday, in connection with the tragic April 2013 accident that killed Kansas City man Leroy 'Buddy' Bronson. Bronson's death was the third in a family plagued by drunk driving accidents. Three years ago, Bronson's wife Diane and his 11-year-old daughter Anna were killed when a drunk driver going the wrong way on the freeway smashed into their white Ford Explorer. Scroll down for video . Three in the family: The drunk driver who killed 57-year-old Leroy Bronson (left) last year was sentenced to just 120 days in prison on Friday. Bronson is pictured above with wife Diane (right) and daughter Anna (center), who died two years before him in a similar accident . Hit and run: 25-year-old Ronald O'Kelly was drunk when he ran through a red light and hit Bronson riding on his motorcycle. He ditched his car and fled the scene on foot. Pictured in court on Friday, right . 'This is horrible. This is disgusting. What is our judicial system saying? Drink? Drive? Kill somebody? Run! You're fine,' Bronson's stepson Tyler Bronson told WFSB in court on Friday. O'Kelly did not issue a statement as he left the court room last week. However, in court O'Kelly apologized to the Bronson family and said the man's death was something he will have to live with forever. 'Since the accident I have thought about it every day, and there is nothing I can say that will make anything better,' he said. 'I’m super sorry about what happened,' he added. 'I will have to live with it for the rest of my life, just like you guys will.' O'Kelly had spent the night Of April 7, 2013 getting drunk at a tavern, witnesses said, before he ran a red light and crashed into Bronson driving his motorcycle. Scene of the crash: Police found O'Kelly banged up Ford F-150 just steps away from the accident and were able to trace the plates back to the 25-year-old . Not again: Above, the scene of the crash that killed Bronson's wife and daughter . From there, O'Kelly fled on foot, but responding police officers were able to find his Ford F-150 with damage just a few hundred feet from the crash scene. They traced the plates back to O'Kelly, and the young man turned himself into police the next day, accompanied by his lawyer. Bronson was pronounced dead just after midnight. In an interview with the Kansas City Star, Tyler Bronson recalls the moment local police knocked on his door to notify him that yet another member of his family had died. 'I couldn’t even imagine why they were at my door at 2:30 in the morning on a Sunday, because you wouldn’t think the same thing could happen twice. Not Ok: Bronson's stepson Tyler Bronson was outraged at the court's decision to sentence O'Kelly to just 120 days in prison . 'At least, not until I saw the look on their face when I opened the door. It was the same look I had seen on the Kansas City police officers’ face not quite two years earlier,' Bronson said. In court on Friday, O'Kelly was handed down a seven-year prison sentence on the manslaughter charge and four years for fleeing the scene. But Jackson County Circuit Court Judge Sandra Midkiff said those two sentences would be suspended if O'Kelly serves 120 in prison without issue. After those 120 days are up, O'Kelly will be on probation. However, this sentence is typical for offenders in Jackson County. According to state corrections records, from 2009 to 2013, eight out of 10 involuntary manslaughter due to intoxication convictions ended in a probation sentence. The Bronson family are currently pursuing a wrongful death lawsuit against O'Kelly.","Leroy Bronson, 57, was killed last year when drunk driver Ronald O'Kelly, 25, sped through a red light and crashed into his motorcycle .

But . his ‘public-spirited’ efforts were yesterday praised by a judge as the . career criminal he refused to let get away was locked up for four years. He ran his foot, literally, to the bone, the court was told. Last night, the teenager shrugged off his heroic intervention and told how he thought only of catching the culprit. ‘It was just adrenalin, really,’ he said. ‘I didn’t even think about not having shoes on. It was just automatic. ‘My dad shouted for help to chase him, so I did. ‘I had no idea about the state of my feet until my dad pointed it out. ‘I looked down and couldn’t believe it. That’s when it started to hurt. I hobbled home and my dad continued the chase.’ Serial offender John Kirk, aged 43, who has more than 216 previous offences, was jailed for four years for the burglary . His . father, Paul Taylor, said: ‘I don’t know how he kept going. Both of his . feet were shredded. They were like lumps of sirloin steak.’ Mr Taylor, a 56-year-old salesman, . said he had been standing talking to his neighbour when he and his son . became embroiled in the drama in March this year. The . father-of-three said they saw 43-year-old heroin addict John Kirk run . round the corner - followed soon after by the burglary victim. Kirk . had struck moments earlier at a home in an adjoining street in . Darlington, County Durham, and had been disturbed by the householder who . gave chase, the court was told. The homeowner managed to corner Kirk but the raider shoved him out of the way and fled with the two computers in bags. Mr Taylor said: ‘A man came running into the close, and to all intents and purposes it looked like he was out jogging. ‘But a few seconds later, a taxi came screeching up after him. I thought it was someone running away from a fare. ‘The . guy (in the taxi) shouted ‘he’s robbed my house and stole my lap-top’, . so I gave chase with the taxi driver and shouted my son to help. ‘We chased him for about ten minutes and when Andrew flushed him out of a garden, I realised he had nothing on his feet. ‘Andrew chased him so far but then started limping badly and I saw his feet. The soles were shredded, almost to the bone.’ Kirk, who has an astonishing 216 previous convictions, was eventually stopped minutes later at a shopping parade. Kirk, of High Northgate, Darlington, denied burglary but was convicted after a trial and was jailed for four years. The shredded foot of Andrew Taylor after he pursued a burglar with no shoes on . He claimed he had been given the computer bags by the fleeing raider and simply ran off when he was challenged. Teesside Crown Court heard how a lanyard with Kirk’s prison ID badge and a key sharpened to a point were found near the scene. Unemployed Kirk had been freed from Holme House Prison in Stockton shortly before the burglary on March 26. The judge, Recorder Simon Phillips, QC, awarded Andrew £250 from public funds for heroically pursuing Kirk through the streets. He . said: ‘Andrew and his father showed tremendous public-spiritedness in . assisting in endeavouring to stop the burglar in his tracks. ‘I have seen the photograph showing the flesh that came away from the ball of Andrew Taylor’s foot, exposing the bone. ‘He suffered very painful consequences from his well-intentioned involvement. He ran his foot, literally, to the bone. ‘I direct the Taylors should be written a letter of commendation by way of a small token of appreciation of their civic duty.’ The judge said Kirk had devastated the lives of the couple he stole from. They are now uneasy in their own home, he added. He said he had been convicted on ‘overwhelming’ evidence which showed he had also been earlier sizing up the house. Christopher . Morrison, defending, said Kirk was in danger of becoming . institutionalised because he had spent so little time at liberty. But he told the judge that he hoped to be able to reintegrate into society when he is released from his latest jail sentence. ‘His record is little less than a litany of what has so far been a wasted life,’ he told the court.","Andrew Taylor, 18, who suffers from cystic fibrosis, followed the thief for 15 minutes .

"With the promise of a superfast internet connection, it was billed as one of the biggest technology launches the UK had seen. But less than 24 hours after the 4G wireless service became available for mobile phones in 11 cities nationwide, questions were being asked about its claims to be five times faster than the current 3G network. Initial reviews and online comments suggested speeds were not quite as promised – while some even suggested that 3G connections had been slowed down to make the new service look quicker by comparison. Scroll down for video . Britain's first 4G network, run by EE, launches today -but has come under fire for its high prices . Costly: EE has come under fire for its high pricing, with experts advising consumers to wait for rival networks to launch . The 4G network is available on Apple’s . iPhone 5 as well as devices from HTC, Samsung, Nokia and Huawei. It was . launched in Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds, . Liverpool, London, Manchester, Sheffield and Southampton. EE, the company behind  T-Mobile and . Orange, launched its 4G service on Tuesday, a full six months before its . major rivals Vodafone, O2 and Three, are able to enter the market. Customers who sign up for a contract . are being promised speeds of between eight and 12 megabits per second . (Mbps), as fast as the average home broadband connection. It means that from now on they should be able to download items, watch videos and view large documents without a long wait. But the BBC’s technology correspondent . Rory Cellan-Jones, who was among the first to try out the new service, . said his own experience was less impressive. ■ The new 4G network was launched in 11 UK cities and will be joined by five more before Christmas, providing coverage to over 20million people. ■ It is currently offered only by the EE network, with customers paying £36 a month upwards. ■ 4G should allow users to watch videos without them freezing, download web pages at high speed, and allow smooth video-phone calls. ■ It’s quicker than its predecessor 3G because it crams more data into the radio signals used to transmit and receive data to phones. ■ Drawbacks are that the phones will run out of power more quickly – and in areas of poor mobile reception, may not be any better than 3G. ■ Earlier this year the Government admitted that when 4G transfers to a different spectrum next year, it may interfere with the Freeview TV signal, which is on an adjacent spectrum. ■ Experts say about two million homes are likely to experience Freeview interference and the Government has set aside £180million for them to have signal filters fitted. ‘For 36 hours, I have been trying out . 4G in two cities where it has been launched by the EE network,’ he . wrote. ‘Everywhere I’ve gone in London and Manchester, outside, indoors, . on trains and in cars, I’ve used a speed-testing application. ‘And while I’ve seen some . breathtakingly fast results, there has also been some worrying evidence . that the speed and extent of the 4G network is being oversold.’ He also claimed the 4G network would not stretch as far as his West London home. There was further criticism from EE . customers who had not upgraded to 4G, who claimed their 3G service had . been slow or down all week ahead of the much-anticipated launch. One wrote on Twitter: ‘My EE has been . slow or down all week in London. Forcing people to upgrade to 4G by . making 3G unusable. Where the hell is [communications regulator] Ofcom?’ Another commented: ‘Is the reason my . Orange 3G has been so terribly slow in and around Heathrow recently a . ploy to make 4G look faster than it actually is?’ Last night, an EE spokesman insisted . that its 3G services had not been slowed to highlight its new service, . adding: ‘This is the fastest network roll-out of its kind anywhere in . the world. By the time other networks finally launch their own 4G . services, EE will have an unrivalled 4G network and will continue to . build on this.’ Olaf Swantee, CEO of EE says today is a 'landmark day' for the firm as it launches Britain's first 4G network .","EE network is live today in 11 cities .

"Tragic:  Namara Whisker, 22, died after a BMW she was travelling in crashed into the River Avon as she travelled home from a night out . A young mother died when the car she was in veered off the road, ploughed through a crash barrier and plunged 20ft into a river. Namara Whisker, 22, was returning home after a night out with friends when the crash happened early on Saturday.

"Nigel Farage faced a backlash from his own supporters last night after calling for Britain to admit refugees from the civil war in Syria. Supporters of the UK Independence Party denounced their leader after Mr Farage used an interview with the BBC yesterday to call for Britain to allow those fleeing Syria to come to the UK. He said refugees fleeing from conflicts were ‘a very different thing’ from economic migrants. Nigel Farage has become the target of fury from his own supporters after suggesting the Britain should accept Syrian refugees during a debate with the BBC yesterday . But he was attacked online by UKIP supporters - who said the country was already ‘full up’ and warned they would no longer vote for UKIP unless he changes his mind. Mr Farage’s policy goes further than the Coalition, which has limited its help to financial support for countries taking in refugees. The UKIP leader said: ‘I think refugees are a very different thing to economic migration and I think this country should honour the 1951 declaration on refugee status that was agreed. ‘The original ideas of defining what a refugee is were good ones and I think, actually, there is a responsibility on all of us in the free West to try and help some of those people fleeing Syria, literally in fear of their lives.’ Mr Farage argued that a refugee - fleeing a country fearing for their life - and a migrant who moves to earn more money are two different things . Mr Farage called for ‘a proper debate’ about ‘the difference between a refugee - who fears for his or her life - or somebody moving simply for economic benefit’. He did not put a figure on how many of the nine million Syrians displaced by war who should be allowed into the UK, but Labour has said Britain should accept up to 500. Mr Farage’s intervention appeared to be an attempt to show voters that UKIP is not opposed to all immigration following months of accusations from political rivals that the party is racist. But the move backfired immediately as UKIP supporters flocked to the party’s Facebook page to denounce the plans. Building contractor Mark Burns said: ‘I suggest that you get Nigel to clarify his comments so as we UKIP voters retain our faith in him and his party. 'UKIP was our salvation, so why even consider making such ludicrous comments. Is he losing the plot? Clarify or lose many voters.’ Truck driver Mark Andrew Royston added: ‘Stuff the UKIP. I was going to vote for these, not now. Sorry, [the] UK is full already.’ Ricky Mckinnell accused Mr Farage of having ‘lost touch with reality’ and asked: ‘Or you have been bought? Got to rethink my vote.’ Keith Goddard added: ‘I’ve backed UKIP for ages but if this is how he is going to do it, I’ll cut my ties.’ James Read wrote: ‘Beginning to think you’re just another out of touch politician. Recently you come across that you haven’t got a clue about what’s going on here.’ Helena Pigott wrote: ‘We are full up. We need to get our country back on a sound financial footing, we cannot take on the responsibility of the world on our shoulders, think again Nigel.’ Mark Burns wrote: ‘Nigel, Syrian refugees need to be safe from the civil war in their country, but bring them here. I think not! Our country is overcrowded as it is and to suggest things like this is ludicrous. So far nine million people have been displaced in the Syrian civil war and have fled to neighboring countries including Jordan, where roughly 115,000 are camped (pictured) ‘I am disappointed that you have suggested such a thing. These people would need financial aid, housing and the use of our schools and hospitals, therefore [they would be] a huge financial burden on our society . 'This was the one main reason I support[ed] UKIP, I am starting to have doubts now.’ Billy Weir said: ‘I liked what was being said in the beginning when we thought you as a party were standing up for Britain. 'Now it seems that you are sitting down with the rest, spouting the same old rhetoric. Disappointed.’ Tory MP Mark Pritchard backed Mr Farage. ‘Clearly we can’t take all the refugees but we should play our part as an open-hearted, compassionate country,’ he said. Farage's policy goes further than the government, who are so far only offering financial aid to victims . Former shadow minister David Davis said: ‘It’s about Mr Farage trying to reposition his party so that the anti-immigration argument, which is so important to them, is not seen as a barbaric argument, so from that point of view there is a bit of political positioning going on. ‘It’s not a bad idea but it will be incredibly complicated; it will need to involve the entire European Union, probably the US, probably Japan, maybe even Russia; pretty much the entire Western world will have to pick up the burden because we’re talking possibly of millions of people.’ Fellow Conservative Andrew Brigden branded Mr Farage’s comments ‘political tokenism’. ‘These are Syrian people who want to live in Syria. The solution is not taking a few hundred people to make us feel happier,’ he said. ‘What we need is a politically-negotiated solution to this problem.’","Nigel Farage has suggested the Britain should accept Syrian refugees .

"Died of his injuries: Bilal Khizar was knocked down and killed by a hit-and-run driver who was speeding away from police . A boy of 12 was knocked down and killed by a car being chased by police as he walked home from a friend’s birthday party. Bilal Khizar was hit by the red Seat Ibiza as he crossed the road at a set of traffic lights at 7pm on Saturday. Moments earlier, officers in a marked police car had pulled the vehicle over at a lay-by to carry out a routine check. As they got out to speak to the driver, the car suddenly sped off. The two officers jumped back into their car and began pursuing the suspect at speed through Bradford. But as the speeding car headed along a 40mph dual carriageway towards the nearby M606, it struck the schoolboy. Despite hitting the youngster, the Seat Ibiza continued towards the motorway and crashed into two further vehicles at a roundabout. Officers discovered the car abandoned six miles away. Two men were later arrested and were last night continuing to be questioned by detectives. The parents of the ‘fun-loving’ youngster, who was a keen rugby, cricket and football fan, were too distraught to comment. They are said to have grown  concerned for him after he failed to return home on time and  began phoning his friends and family and contacting people  on Facebook. They had no idea he had been involved in an accident and were still searching for him at 9pm on Saturday, friends said. Bilal’s aunt, Nadia Karin, said: ‘He was such a happy child. He was loved by all the family and everyone at school. We just can’t believe he’s gone. We’re devastated.’ Tyre marks were clearly visible at the scene of the crash on Rooley Lane yesterday as specialist accident investigators set about the task of piecing together Bilal’s last moments. Devastated: School friends lay flowers at the spot where the 12-year-old boy was killed as he walked on a pedestrian crossing . Inconsolable: Mourners, believed to be the victim's relatives, attend the scene of the collision, which happened at around 7pm on Saturday . In a tragic twist, it emerged that just hours before his death Bilal had told his friends how he wanted a ‘yellow and happy’ funeral. Eve Whitaker, 12, who left a tribute with her mother, teacher Sam, 44, and other friends, said: ‘He had left at about 6.40pm on his scooter to go home. ‘It’s so strange, just before he died we were talking about funerals. He said he wanted his to be yellow, with yellow flowers, nothing black. He wanted it to be happy.’ Ifrah Satti, 12, who was in the same class with Bilal at Bradford Academy, said: ‘I can’t believe what has happened. Bilal was so popular. He had been to a birthday party and was on his way home when he died.’ West Yorkshire Police has referred itself to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. A spokesman for the force said: ‘The incident happened when a marked police car stopped a red Seat Ibiza in a lay-by on Rooley Lane for a check. ‘As officers got out of their vehicle to speak to the driver the car immediately made off at speed along Rooley Lane. Officers got back into their car and followed it. The collision happened moments later.’ Evasion tactics: A policewoman offers support the boy's family and friends. The collision happened as the car made off at speed after being stopped by police for a check . Tragedy: The boy was on a crossing on Rooley Lane, in Bradford, West Yorkshire, when he was hit by the red Seat Ibiza . The spokesman said the force was . unable to reveal exactly what offences the two men in custody had been . arrested for. But it will almost certainly include causing death by . dangerous driving and fleeing the scene of an accident. Detective Superintendent Mark Ridley said: ‘This is a tragedy for the family and they are absolutely devastated. ‘I am appealing directly to anyone who saw the vehicle being driven or the incident to get in contact.’","Bilal Khizar had discussed his funeral moments before he died, friends said .

"It is known as one of the most intrepid polar expeditions in history, and cost five men their lives. But over 100 years on from Captain Robert Falcon Scott’s ill-fated trek to the South Pole and back, two men have become the first people in history to complete the iconic 1,800-mile route. At 1.15am GMT Ben Saunders, 36 from Britain and former WASPS rugby player Tarka L’Herpiniere, 32, from France, completed the epic Terra Nova trek. Scroll down for video . At 1.15am GMT Ben Saunders, 36 and former WASPS rugby player Tarka L'Herpiniere, 32, completed the epic Terra Nova trek . The Terra Nova Expedition, officially the British Antarctic Expedition, was led by Robert Falcon Scott with the objective of being the first to reach the geographical South Pole. Scott and four companions reached the pole on 17 January 1912, where they found that a Norwegian team led by Roald Amundsen had preceded them by 33 days. Scott's entire party died on the return journey from the pole. Some of their bodies, journals and photographs were discovered by a search party eight months later. For many years after his death, Scott's status as tragic hero was unchallenged, and few questions were asked about the causes of the disaster which overcame his polar party. The degree of Scott's personal culpability remains a matter of controversy among commentator, but it is thought that exhaustion, extreme cold and starvation definitely led to the men's demise. They walked for 1,795 miles across the inhospitable landscape of Antarctica to set the world record for the longest polar journey on foot in history. It has taken them 105 days in total and pushed the limits of their mental and physical strength, as each men pulled sleds with over 200kg of equipment and walked on average 17 miles daily in temperatures as low as -46C wind chill. The entire trek was equivalent to 69 back-to-back marathons. Mr Saunders said, ‘It is almost impossible to comprehend what we have achieved. 'Completing Scott’s Terra Nova expedition has been a life-long dream and I’m overcome to be standing here at the finish. They walked for 1,795 miles across the inhospitable landscape of Antarctica to set the world record for the longest polar journey on foot in history . Captain Scott and his men (pictured) died having covered almost 1,600 miles of the route in their bid to become the first men to reach the South Pole . Captain Robert Falcon Scott, 1868 to 1912. British Royal Navy officer and Antarctic explorer. ‘The journey has been a mammoth undertaking that has tested the bounds of our bodies and minds each and every day.’ ‘At times we found ourselves in dire straits in the intense cold, wind and altitude of the high plateau, weakened by half-rations and closer to the brink of survival than I had ever anticipated this journey taking us. ‘In that light, both Tarka and I feel a . combination of awe and profound respect for the endurance, tenacity and . fortitude of Captain Scott and his team, a century ago.’ Captain Scott and his men died having covered almost 1,600 miles of the route in their bid to become the first men to reach the South Pole. They were pipped to the accolade on 17 January 1912 by a team of Norwegian explorers led by Roald Amundsen and on their return journey died of a combination of exhaustion, starvation and extreme cold. While Captain Scott’s men had rudimentary equipment by today’s standards, the two modern explorers were kitted out with gear from Intel, which managed to provide a Wi-Fi connection so that the explorers could blog about their adventure from arguably the most inhospitable place on the planet. The incredible journey: The Scott Expedition was a 1,800-mile (2,900km), four-month return journey from the coast of Antarctica to the South Pole and back on foot following Scott¿s route. It has taken them 105 days in total and pushed the limits of their mental and physical strength, as each men pulled sleds with over 200kg of equipment and walked on average 17 miles daily in temperatures as low as -46C wind chill. Here, the two explorers rest in their tent and use their computers before embarking on another 17 mile walk the next day in the snow . The explorers were kitted out with a Sony VAIO Pro Ultrabook each built to survive in temperatures up to -40C. The computers sported a 4th generation Intel Core processor and provided Wi-Fi in one of the earth's most inhospitable places. Each computer weighed 870g and were prepared to have the minimum amount of programmes on them, which led the duo to create their own games on the laptops. They connected to the internet using an Iriduim satellite phone. The kit was charged using solar panels attached to the specially designed sleds. Intel tested the technology by freezing it in labs for months at a time to make sure it would work in the extremely cold temperatures. Retracing Scott’s original 1911-12 route, Ben Saunders and Tarka started at Scott’s Hut on the north shore of Cape Evans on Ross Island. They traversed the Ross Ice Shelf, before climbing nearly 8000ft on one of the world’s largest glaciers, the Beardmore Glacier, on to the Antarctic Plateau; and onwards to the South Pole. From the Pole it was back the way they came, finishing 900 miles (1,450km) later back where they began at the coast.

"As television’s mild-mannered horticulturalist turned daytime chat-show host, Alan Titchmarsh rarely courts controversy. But when he invited ‘dog whisperer’ Cesar Millan to appear as a guest it was never going to please everyone. US-based Millan’s unconventional training methods to ‘rehabilitate’ ill-disciplined dogs, including physically attacking them, using electric shocks and spikes on collars, have split public opinion worldwide and led many to brand him ‘barbaric’. Scroll down for video . Alan Titchmarsh and Dog whisperer Cesar Millan during the heated interview on the 'The Alan Titchmarsh Show' yesterday . Controversy: Millan's methods with training dogs have split opinion . A wave of protests was unleashed even before The Alan Titchmarsh Show went out on ITV yesterday afternoon. More than 1,000 people joined a Twitter campaign demanding Millan’s appearance be cancelled. Production staff were inundated with calls and Titchmarsh was bombarded with hundreds of emails, while a Facebook page set up by protesters attracted 1,600 followers. And when animal welfare campaigners threatened to disrupt the live show, extra security staff were drafted in. Alan Titchmarsh, left, gave his guest, dog whisperer Cesar Millan, right, a tough grilling on his show . Although Titchmarsh, 63, refused to cancel the interview, he took on his guest in an uncharacteristically confrontational style. ‏ . @iChristianMark: Alan titchmarsh clearly has no idea what he's talking about. Cesar Milan has so much respect and affection for dogs. ‏@JenLant: Shocked to see how Alan Titchmarsh treated @cesarmillan on his tv show. Cesar is nothing but professional and works well with dogs. ‏@floatygoat: Alan Titchmarsh interviewing Cesar Milan was so frustrating. Less of an interview, more of a series of stupid accusations. ‏@kjvjude113: Titchmarsh was a complete a***‏@bigGstacey: very frustrating, the guys has clearly never watched dog whisperer.... I wana punch titchmarsh now. #mynanwillhateme . @ShelleyWolfson: Appalling treatment by Alan Titchmarsh on @ITV of @cesarmillan. Where is your evidence? I have seen nothing but good from Cesar. Titchmarsh told Millan: ‘You punish dogs, you hit them. I’ve seen you punch a dog in the throat to get it to behave and to most people, like myself, I would say that is totally unacceptable as a way of training a dog.’ An unsettled Millan replied: ‘Well obviously I would respectfully disagree with that. It’s not a punch, it’s a touch.’ Titchmarsh countered: ‘I watched the video of it and if somebody touched me like that I would be hurt. You went for the throat and you punched the dog back and the dog bit you and held on to your hand. ‘Having watched a lot of boxing matches it looked like something Henry Cooper would deliver.’ Millan again insisted that it was nothing more than a touch. ‘But you also work with electric shocks and collars and spikes on collars that really hurt them,’ continued Titchmarsh. ‘You know, this is pretty barbaric treatment. What’s your reasoning for treating dogs like this?’Millan insisted that his methods were simply used to ‘snap the (dog’s) brain out of it’. After the interview opinion on Twitter and other social media was divided, with some backing Titchmarsh, while others rounded on him for being ‘abusive’. In a statement read out on air, the RSPCA said: ‘Adverse training techniques which have been seen to be used by Cesar Millan can cause pain and fear for dogs and may worsen their behavioural problems. ‘The RSPCA believes that using such techniques is unacceptable, nor are they necessary to change dog behaviour for the better when other dog trainers use reward-based methods to train dogs very effectively.’ Controversy: Mexocan-born Millan with one of the animals he has trained .","Alan Titchmarsh grilled his guest Cesar Millan on the 'totally unacceptable' way that he trains dogs .

"Supermarkets are to relax standards and sell ‘ugly’ vegetables for the first time after bad weather and flooding left many crops small and misshapen. Poor growing conditions have left parsnips, carrots, potatoes and Brussels sprouts discoloured and small. But stores including Sainsbury’s and Morrisons say they will take the crops in a show of solidarity with struggling British farmers. Healthy: The veg we eat over Christmas will still be good for us, but it might not look as good as the vegetables in this picture with supermarkets to relax standards and sell 'ugly' vegetables for the first time . Morrisons says it is committed to take 100 per cent of farmers’ produce this year, regardless of size or abnormalities. Judith Batchelar, of Sainsbury’s, said: ‘We have been trying to take as much of the crop as possible, in what we call ugly fruit and veg. Customers have said that beauty is more than skin deep, and actually they understand some of the challenges that British farmers have had this season.’ Until now, farmers were said to be throwing away a fifth of their fruit and vegetables because they would fail to meet supermarket shape and size guidelines. But the decision may not be enough to meet rising demand from consumers, with retailers forced to import from abroad. The heavy rain this year has left many carrots deformed and some potatoes have developed rot and mould in waterlogged soil. Parsnip crops are down 15 per cent on last year while potato crops have shrunk to the lowest level since the drought of 1976. The conditions for harvest are so poor that some of the winter vegetables may have to be left in the ground until Spring. As a result suppliers fear they may not be able to meet the demand for winter vegetables and some retailers are now importing from abroad. Gala apples, the country’s favourite variety and a tasty choice for apple sauce, are arriving from Slovakia. Ugly Veg.JPG . Garden peas are being shipped in after a 5,300 mile trip from Guatemala and chestnuts from Turkey. Marks & Spencer said it was ‘pulling out all the stops’ to meet its commitment to sell only British grown Brussels. ‘The weather has been difficult this year,’ a spokesman said. ‘For example, sprout crops around the country have been damaged by heavy rainfall throughout the year which in some areas has caused sprout plants to have stunted growth and some plants have just been destroyed.’ Matthew Rawson, chairman of the Brassica Growers Association, said: . ‘British growers are working as hard as humanly possible to get Brussels sprouts on people’s plates this Christmas. ‘The weather has been against us though; with wet soil and low light some of the plants haven’t formed roots and have smaller leaves than usual. ‘We’ve had lower yields this year on last and now they are predicting a cold snap before Christmas, which could be quite damaging to crops.’","Poor growing conditions have left parsnips, carrots, potatoes and Brussels sprouts discoloured and small .

"Miracle babes: Jo Powell risked her own life by refusing treatment for breast cancer during her pregnancy with son Jake . It is a decision no expectant mother should have to face. After years of trying for a baby, Jo Powell finally discovered that she was pregnant. But her delight turned to despair days later when doctors found she had breast cancer and advised her to sacrifice her unborn child’s life in order to save her own by beginning chemotherapy. Mrs Powell defied the doctors, however, and refused to start the treatment until much later in her pregnancy, in a gamble that could have cost her her life. Miraculously, she and her husband Richard are now celebrating with their young son, Jake, after being told that she has beaten the cancer. Mrs Powell, 41, an office administrator, said yesterday: ‘When I heard the word cancer my first thought was, “I’m going to lose my baby.” ‘It was like I was in a living nightmare. We had been trying for a baby for years, and we were convinced it wasn’t going  to happen for us, so Jake was so special. ‘I knew we couldn’t give up on our baby. There was no way I was going to sacrifice him to save myself. ‘I knew that even if I didn’t make it, I would have brought a life into the world.’ The couple, from Newark, Nottinghamshire, discovered Mrs Powell was pregnant in 2010. But days later she found a lump in her breast. Doctors at Nottingham City Hospital warned that they could not begin chemotherapy while she was still in the early stages of pregnancy. Mrs Powell was told that if she chose to keep her unborn child she would have to delay chemotherapy until later in her pregnancy when her  baby would be strong enough to survive it. The doctors advised her to consider an abortion, explaining that her cancer was aggravated by her hormones and that the pregnancy could help the disease grow faster. But Mrs Powell refused to give up on her unborn child.The doctors agreed to postpone her treatment for nearly six months but insisted on operating on her breast to remove the tumours on her lymph nodes immediately. Risky: Mrs Powell did agree to have an operation to remove the lymph nodes from her breast when she was 10 weeks pregnant but was relieved to hear Jake's heartbeat following the surgery .

Mrs Powell began the chemotherapy . when she was five months’ pregnant. Amazingly, the treatment had no . effect on Jake, who was born just before Christmas in 2010. But days after the birth, Mrs Powell . began intensive treatment for cancer which left  her fighting for her . life. Mr Powell, 30, looked after their son while his wife spent weeks . in hospital before undergoing a mastectomy. Now, after a long ordeal, the couple have been told she needs no further treatment. Mrs Powell added: ‘We’re just thrilled that we can finally be a happy, healthy family after all we’ve been through. ‘I feel like we’ve won the lottery. I’m the luckiest woman in the world.’ Lucky: Mrs Powell said: 'Two years ago, I felt like our lives were falling apart. Now, I couldn't be happier. I feel like we're the luckiest family in the world' Healthy boy: Luckily, Mrs Powell's cancer treatment has had no damaging effect on Jake, who was born just before Christmas 2010 .","Jo Powell, 41, discovered lump in her breast days after finding out she was pregnant with first child .

"While other dogs might come running at the sound of the tin opener, Jack the Cavalier King Charles spaniel was so overweight he could barely walk to the kitchen – and even went deaf. But that didn’t stop him from getting through three tins of dog food a day, as well as plenty of treats and leftovers. His unhealthy diet meant he tipped the scales in excess of three stone – more than double the ideal weight for his breed. Scroll down for video . What a lump! Vet nurse Amy Henson struggles to carry Jack the Cavalier King Charles spaniel, who tipped the scales at a morbidly obese 3st before entering a pet version of The Biggest Loser . Looks more like a bear: The eight-year-old was so overweight he could barely walk to the kitchen - and even went deaf . In great shape: Jack was named pet slimming champion in a competition organised by veterinary charity PDSA after shedding a third of his body weight (right) DAILY FOOD BEFORE: Three cans of tinned dog food, as much dry dog food as he could eat, dog treats, cake, leftover food from his owners’ plates, chocolate . EXERCISE: None, as he was indoors 24 hours a day . WEIGHT: 45lbs DAILY FOOD NOW: A bowl of special dry diet food in the morning and a bowl of the same food in the evening. If he is lucky, he will get some cooked vegetables as a treat with his evening meal . EXERCISE: Walks every morning and almost every evening . WEIGHT: 31lbs . Now, however, the eight-year-old has shed a third of his body weight and trimmed an impressive eight inches from his waist. And yesterday, Jack was named pet slimming champion in a competition organised by veterinary charity PDSA. Owner Rose Welsh, 52, who adopted ‘Jumbo Jack’ in January, said he came to her having been over-fed and barely exercised. His vast intake of treats and goodies led to deafness as fat blocked his ear canals, and his weight prevented him from walking more than a few steps. Mrs Welsh said: ‘The vet said that he was morbidly obese and would die unless he started an immediate diet. ‘As . far as we were aware the previous owners simply left him from 5am until . 6pm every day. When he came to us he couldn’t walk, hear, bark or . play.’ Feline figure: Fifi Bottomley, an eight-year-old rescue cat from Bradford, is now almost unrecognisable after losing 4.4lbs and now weighs a healthier 16lb . Bloated bunny: Greedy rabbit Bobby, a four-year-old mini-lop from Middlesbrough who stole her partner's food, drop a third of her bodyweight . But following a strict six-month diet and fitness regime, Jack can now do all of those things. Mrs Welsh, from Stanmore, north-west London, added: ‘Today he is a different dog. He is fit, healthy and happy.’ The competition saw 17 obese pets lose 13.5 stone between them – the equivalent of around 28 healthy Yorkshire terriers. But while Jack was happy to winalot, his was not the only success story. Before: Porky Cocker Spaniel Billy, from Airdrie before joining PDSA Pet Fit Club .

Fifi Bottomley, an eight-year-old rescue cat from Bradford, is now almost unrecognisable as the feline who first entered the vets. She lost 4.4lbs and now weighs a healthier 16lb. She was rescued as a starving kitten by her first owner and it was this early experience that is being blamed for her over-eating. She gorged on extra meals from neighbours - and even stole bird food from the garden. Her weight ballooned until she was morbidly obese. But since dieting she is much more active and playful.

"Shocking: Anne Diamond provoked a backlash from Sky News viewers after she appeared to make light of Megan Stammers' eloping with Jeremy Forrest . Anne Diamond caused outrage yesterday after she flippantly dismissed the hunt for Megan Stammers as ‘a bit so whatish’. The former breakfast TV presenter said the age gap between the missing teenager, 15, and her maths teacher Jeremy Forrest, 30, was ‘not sickeningly huge’. Her comments – made during Tuesday evening’s paper review on Sky News – prompted a wave of angry comments from viewers who said the 58-year-old was ‘out of touch’. Miss Diamond, who has four children with ex-husband Mike Hollingsworth, 68, began by telling Sky News presenter Anna Jones: ‘Clearly, this is wrong. 'He shouldn’t have done it and he must be tracked down and he must be brought to book for it, but it’s just got everybody talking about relationships others had with their teachers. ‘She’s 15, he’s twenty-something.’ The presenter interrupted to correct Miss Diamond about Forrest’s age but undeterred she continued: ‘At any rate, it’s not a sickeningly huge age gap.’ Ignoring the fact that Megan is still classed as a minor, she added: ‘I’m not making light of what is a crime here...but nevertheless, again I feel it’s a bit so whatish.’ Miss Diamond’s remarks come as the hunt continues for the pair following their apparent elopement to France.

"Killer instincts? Lacey Spears, 26, is pictured with her 5-year-old son Garnett (right) who she's now accused of killing . A New York State mom blogger who gained a widespread following with posts about her son's near-constant health problems could soon be charged in the 5-year-old's suspicious January death. Authorities in Westchester County almost immediately looked to Lacey Spears when her son Garnett died and have since determined the boy died from acute sodium poisoning. Now, a source close to the investigation has revealed that the 26-year-old southern transplant could soon find herself in a New York jail as authorities prepare to press charges in what they've deemed a homicide. 'It's evident by the nature of what was found in his body that somebody, in effect, poisoned him,' the source told FoxNews.com. 'He died at the hands of somebody else.' Should Spears be charged, it will be the culmination of months of speculation over her involvement in the death, the state of her mental health and of her possible motivations. Spears could potentially get charged with anything from murder to negligent homicide or manslaughter. Since her son's death, Spears has fled New York, where the Alabama native lived in a 'fellowship community' of back-to-the-land types, for Kentucky. Her attorney David Sachs denied his client had anything to do with her son's death. 'Lacey is completely devastated by the loss of her son and absolutely denies harming her son in any way,' Sachs told FoxNews.com . Agonizing: The boy died from acute sodium intoxication days after he was rushed to a Westchester County, New York hospital complaining of severe stomach pains . Garnett Spears died at Westchester . Medical Center in January after Spears rushed him to the emergency room . on suffering intense abdominal pains from what appeared to be a stomach . virus. The little boy's condition worsened and he died four days later with what appeared to be dangerously high amounts of sodium in his system - leading investigators to question whether Garnett was deliberately given the salt. Indeed, before he tragically passed away, hospital officials told police that the levels were suspiciously high - which caused the investigation to be opened into the Chestnut Ridge mother. Following this, police sought and obtained a search warrant for her home in mid-January. Suspicious: A neighbor claims Spears asked that he hide one of the many feeding tube bags that she used--unnecessarily many say--to feed Garnett as he lay dying in January . They took food from her home, her cell phone and computer. They have also questioned Lacey Spears' friends and family and obtained Garnett's past medical records after discovering that he had been hospitalized 23-times during his short life. As the investigation continued, a neighbor who asked not to be named told USA Today that as Spears' son lay dying she asked her to go to her home and dispose of one of the boy's feeding bags - which allegedly contained a large amount of sodium. Police have not released why Garnett . had a feeding tube - believed to be in his abdomen - but have pointed to . his history of illness and repeated hospital visits. The . neighbor who asked not to be named said that they did initially remove . the bag - but then phoned the police and turned it over when they heard . about the circumstances surrounding the boys death. Those circumstances, it became clear all too late, were nothing new. The . same questionable parenting and suggestions of the child-harming mental . illness Munchhausen by proxy surrounded Garnett and his mom starting . from just after the boy was born and across the states of Alabama, . Florida and New York. The . Florida Department of Children and Families revealed in April that . they've had a file on Spears since 2011, when an anonymous call voicing . concerns about her parenting was made to their abuse hotline. And . prior to that, in 2009 while the family lived in Alabama, Garnett . suffered severe seizures and had to be flown by helicopter to a Decatur . hospital and resuscitated. The . Journal News reported last month that the Florida agency is sharing all . information they have on the mother with New York authorities. Sad: Garnett was hospitalized more than 23 times during his five years of life and his mother Lacey updated social media to update her followers on her sons progress . Munchausen by proxy, is a psychiatric disorder which makes a parent purposely hurt their child — to get attention. 'It is so counter-intuitive to all our ideas of what parenthood is supposed to be,' said Dr. Marc D. Feldman who has written extensively about Munchausen syndrome. 'But medical child abuse can and does occur.' Feldmen told USA Today that this case has at least four distinct red-flags for him that indicate the possibility of abuse. 1) Garnett had a feeding tube for unknown reasons. In case of Munchausen by proxy the child will be sick enough to have a feeding tube or intravenous line that gives the abuser access to the body internally. 'That's an avenue for medical chaos,' Feldman said. 'A feeding tube is a real red flag.' 2) It is almost physically impossible to ingest or force feed a lethal does of salt. However, introducing it over time through a feeding tube is possible. 3) Feldman points out that those with Munchausen often exhibit pseudologia fantastica — compulsive lying - Spears told lies about her partner and about being a mother . 4) Exaggerated stories of their child being ill is another symptom - and in this case Spears obsessively detailed her child's illnesses online . People with the condition also have borderline personality disorder, a psychiatric condition marked by problems with impulsive and reckless behavior, leading to unstable relationships. Signs of Munchausen by proxy can include: .","Suspicion has rested almost solely on Lacey Spears since the January death of her little boy Garnett .
A source now says authorities in Westchester County, New York have deemed the boy's death a homicide by sodium poisoning .
Spears could now face charges ranging from murder to manslaughter or negligent homicide .

"A bigamist was caught by his wife after she saw a photograph of his wedding to a teenager on Facebook. Nicolette Watkinson called the police after discovering Stephen Smith, 52, married Awa Jobarteh, 19, at the same registry office in Africa where they had wed seven years earlier. But Smith has avoided a prison sentence after claiming he was duped by Miss Jobarteh – who dumped him two days after they returned to the UK from Gambia and has not been traced since. Bigamist: Stephen Smith, 52, was caught after this picture of him with his new bride Awa Jobarteh, 19, appeared on Facebook and was seen by his current wife . Suffering: Nicolette Smith leaves Teesside Crown Court and said she was disappointed her estranged husband, Stephen Smith, was not jailed for bigamy . Miss Watkinson, 39, a marketing . executive, met factory worker Smith in 2001 and they married in 2005. The father of two was divorced from his first wife at the time. Just . 18 months after their wedding, they split up and Miss Watkinson moved . out of the marital home in Pickering, North Yorkshire. However, . Smith failed to keep up with the mortgage repayments and left without . giving a forwarding address. The house was repossessed and Miss . Watkinson was saddled with a £160,000 debt, which bankrupted her. Smith . had disappeared and her lawyers received no reply in their efforts to . start divorce proceedings. Defence: Stephen Smith claimed he was a victim after his young bride fled within two days of arriving in Britain . After hearing that her husband had met a new . lover in Gambia, Miss Watkinson checked his Facebook page and found the . wedding photo of him with Miss Jobarteh. Teesside . Crown Court was told that Smith, of York, thought he had signed an . official divorce petition on the day before his wedding to Miss Jobarteh . in Banjul, the capital of Gambia, in November 2012. He . said he had left finalising the divorce papers to his young bride and . that she returned the documents with a ‘red stamp of authorisation’ on . them. But Miss . Watkinson’s signature on the papers was fake. Robert Mochrie, defending, . said: ‘This was a man who acted rather hastily. It is, you might think, . absurd somebody is getting married on the same day they are handed a . divorce certificate. If he’d waited just a few months perhaps, a divorce . might well have been finalised.’ Mr . Mochrie told the court that Smith married Miss Jobarteh out of love, . adding: ‘This defendant, born in 1961, was perhaps understandably taken . by her and was keen to tie the knot. ‘People are often paid to become involved in sham marriages but that was not the case.’ He . added: ‘He has been wronged. He was abandoned by his third wife. Her . intentions were quite clearly to dupe a man of more senior years, as so . often happens with men who travel to foreign lands to seek happiness.’ On . Thursday, Smith was given a six month jail sentence suspended for two . years and ordered to do 150 hours of unpaid work. He admitted bigamy at . an earlier hearing. Judge . Tony Briggs said he had ‘considerable sympathy’ for Miss Watkinson, . adding: ‘I can well understand her being extremely upset by the thought . that you’d married again without the courtesy of going through a divorce . with her.’ But outside the . court, Miss Watkinson said of Smith: ‘I feel as though he has got away . with this and has been portrayed as some kind of victim himself after . all that he has put me through. ‘He knew if he responded to my divorce petition, he’d give away where he’d been hiding.’ Long journey: Smith had married second wife Nicolette in the Gambia after they 'fell in love' with the country only to return in 2012 to marry a teenager behind her back . Wronged: Nicolette was left bankrupt after Smith disappeared and failed to pay the mortgage . Smith is not the first bigamist to fall foul of Facebook. Former . policeman Martin Curran, 52, of Burtonwood, Cheshire, lied to his wife . Lisa when she found Facebook pictures of him marrying his lover. He said . they were fake but was convicted and given a community order in August . 2012. Benefits cheat . Heath Joynson, 45, of Stoke, claimed to be single but got caught last . August after his wife posted their wedding pictures on the social . networking site. And Brian Frain was jailed for three months after his first wife saw him marrying again before they were even divorced. When . jailed in September, Frain, 36, of Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, said he . couldn’t wait to get out of the marriage so he could marry a third time, . to mother-of-four Donna Darwent, 33.","Nicolette Smith disappointed Stephen Smith not jailed for taking new bride .

"A girl of three who featured in ITV soap Emmerdale died from horrific burns after her dress caught fire in a freak accident. Sophie Firth apparently leaned over a gas fire at her grandmother’s home and her clothes ignited. Her mother Amy Harhoff, 28, tried to smother the flames with a blanket, but Sophie was severely injured, with 70 per cent of her body covered in burns. Angelic: Sophie Firth, aged three, has died of organ failure after her dress was set alight by a gas fire . She was taken to Sheffield Children’s . Hospital and transferred to the burns unit but lost her fight to stay . alive on Tuesday – nine days after she was admitted. Her family, including her father . Neil, a project manager for Doncaster Council, and Amy, a traffic . planner for the council, were with her when she died. They issued a statement telling of . their devastation at losing their ‘bright and beautiful’ little girl. Sophie also had a one-year-old brother. She appeared in Emmerdale for three months in 2009 as Angelica, baby of Jimmy and Nicola King. The family had been living at the . grandmother’s home in Skellow, Doncaster, while renovation work was . being carried out on their home in Austerfield, Doncaster. She was due to appear in a nativity play at her nursery school next week. The fatal accident happened at the family home in Skellow, South Yorkshire on December 2. Actress: In 2009, Sophie played Angelica, the baby daughter of Jimmy and Nicola King on Emmerdale - the onscreen family are pictured together here . Heart-breaking: Sophie's parents described her as a 'little princess' after her death . After catching fire, her mother Amy . Harhoff, 28, desperately tried to to save the girl by smothering her in a . blanket as family members called for fire and ambulance services. The . house, where the three-year-old's family was living while their own . home nearby was being renovated, was not damaged by the fire. Sophie was taken to hospital in Sheffield for treatment to her 70 per cent burns and was later transferred to a specialist unit in Newcastle. She was given a skin graft last Friday, but her organs began to fail after she developed a blood infection. Her parents, who both work for Doncaster Council, were at her side when she passed away. They have spoken of their devastation at losing their 'beautiful little girl' and say they will 'carry their little princess in their arms forever'. Sophie's brother, George, turns one year old today. Soon after she was born, Sophie was . on the cast of Emmerdale for three months from August 2009 playing . Angelica King, before being replaced by Rebecca Bakes. Home: Sophie was injured at her grandmother's house in Skellow, South Yorkshire on December 2 . In . the soap, Angelica was born prematurely and suffered from breathing . problems. After being released from intensive care, she was kidnapped by . her aunt Lexi, who was upset at her inability to have a child, and held . hostage on the roof of the hospital. 'We are devastated to hear of Sophie's tragic death,' a spokesman for the programme said. 'Our sincere condolences go out to her family. Everyone at Emmerdale is thinking of them at this sad time.' Sophie's uncle Mick Harhoff paid tribute to his 'beautiful niece' and said the family would never get over the loss. 'Sophie was such a lovely little girl and she was exceptionally bright,' he said. 'She always used to say that she wanted to be a princess. 'You do expect that one day you may bury your parents but you never expect to bury a child.' A spokesman for South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue said: 'This was a tragic accident and our thoughts are with the girl’s family and friends at this extremely distressing time. 'Any fire can be dangerous.

"Celebrating your 18th birthday is a momentous occasion for anyone, but for tiny Jyoti Amge the milestone is even bigger news. The 2ft teenager is already a mini celebrity in her hometown of Nagpur, India, but is now set for a huge record when she is officially declared the world's smallest woman. And despite her miniature stature, 61.95cm-tall Jyoti hopes to celebrate being crowned the world's shortest woman by launching a Bollywood movie career. Scroll down for video . Big news: Jyoti is measured at 61.95cm on her 18th birthday by Guinness . World Record officials, making her the world's shortest woman . The 18-year-old sits at home in Nagpur, India, in front of a pink teddy bear which looms over her tiny frame . She took the Guinness World Record from 2ft 3in American Bridgette Jordan, and celebrated her birthday with a teddy bear which loomed over her tiny 24.4in frame. She measured 7 centimeters (2.76 inches) shorter than the 22-year-old American Bridgette Jordan, who had held the title since September. A teary-eyed Jyoti, dressed in one of her finest saris, called the honor an 'extra birthday present' and said she felt grateful for being small, as it had brought her recognition. She also blew out candles on a birthday cake which was comfortably bigger than her. Even the Guinness World Records book at the ceremony came up to Jyoti's waist. Jyoti weighs just 12lbs (5.5kg) - only 9lbs more than she did at birth - and has a form of dwarfism call achondroplasia, which stopped her growing after her first birthday. She has brittle bones and is likely to need care for the rest of her life, but that has not stopped her tall ambitions of cracking the movie industry.

Pint-sized: Jyoti weighs just 12lbs, only 9lbs more than she did when she was born . Standing tall: Jyoti's dwarfism condition means she is likely to stay the same size for the rest of her life . Budding actress Jyoti, who is set to appear in two Bollywood films next year, told The Sun: 'I want to make people happy.' As a teenager at school in Nagpur, Jyoti had her own small desk and chair, but said the other students didn't treat her any differently. She also has to sleep in a specially-made bed and uses utensils that are smaller than average. This was not Amge's first Guinness record. Until Friday she was considered the world's shortest teenager, but in turning 18 qualified for the new title. She has grown less than 1cm (0.4in) in the last two years, Guinness said in a statement, and will grow no more due to a form of dwarfism called achondroplasia. Her teenage title brought the chance for multiple Guinness-sponsored trips to Japan and Italy for tours and meetings with other record holders, she said. The title of shortest woman in history continues to be held by Pauline Musters, who lived in the Netherlands from 1876 to 1895 and stood 61 centimeters (24 inches) tall.

"Arms folded tightly to her chest, a  shopper winces in alarm as she finds herself surrounded by a swarm of bees – on a busy street in Central London. Around 5,000 of the insects descended on a branch of Topshop yesterday, sending passers-by scrambling for cover. Witnesses said they could ‘hardly see the sky’ as the colony made a nest on the bustling high street. Scroll down for video . A woman is surrounded by 5,000 bees which caused a buzz by nesting on a discount sign on the window of Topshop in Victoria Street, London this morning . A swarm of 5,000-strong honeybees that have been attracted to a discount sign on the window of Topshop in Victoria Street, central London, today . Meanwhile, in Southsea student George Heal, 21, was shocked to find his Nissan Micra, parked outside his home, covered in a swarm of 20,000 bees. Experts said it's common for honeybees to swarm around and set up new hives at this time of year. The marine biology student said: 'One of my housemates pointed my car out to me and it was just surrounded by bees. 'It’s not something you see every day. I believe they are all gone now but I will definitely be checking the car before I get in it.' The unusual nesting places for the bees are picked by the Queen bee, who lands there first and are quickly followed by her devoted colony. Honeybees eyes . are more sensitive to ultraviolet colours, which Gill Maclean from the . British Beekeepers Association (BBKA) says could be why they were attracted to . the green sign and the car. 'It . is in their nature to look for bright flowers and colours. Also when . they swarm they generally hang from the branch of a tree so it is a . possibility they could be attracted to the green for that reason.' Scores of Londoners stopped to take photographs of the unusual sight outside Topshop, in the heart of busy central London. Tony Mann, a project manager at nearby John Lewis and a trained bee keeper, dashed over to the shop to help lead efforts to smoke the European honeybee colony out. Scores of passersby stopped to photograph the bees as they landed on the Topshop sign in Victoria Street . Tony Mann, a project manager at nearby . John Lewis and a trained bee keeper, dashed over to the shop to help . lead efforts to smoke the European honeybee colony out . Mr Mann, who donned a white bee keeping costume and netted hat for the tricky task, said: 'We have either had a virgin Queen or an old Queen, she has left the nest and she has brought the warm and settled on the shop front.' Honeybees have been providing humans with honey for centuries and play an important role in the pollination process. But in recent years the species has come  under threat and beekeepers have seen the numbers dwindle. It . has been estimated that the number of British honeybees has halved over . the last 25 years and scientists claim there are only enough to . properly pollinate a quarter of the country’s crops. Experts have warned that the . collapse of bee colonies could trigger a farming crisis, but why . populations are being hit so hard has remained largely a mystery. It is thought populations could have plummeted as the insect’s meadowland habitats were concreted over and their wildflower food supply killed by herbicides. A . recent study by the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) in . Cambridge, Massachusetts, has added weight to the theory that even low . doses of an insecticide have an adverse effect on hives. He said some of the bees were flying around the area 'like scouts to try to find out where the next best place to go is'. The colony was later safely moved across the road to Westminster Cathedral, where it will be looked after by beekeepers on top of the Catholic church's roof. It is not known where the bees originally came from, but a string of shops in the local area do have their own hives. David Beamont, operations manager at the Victoria Business Improvement District (BID), which manages the interests of businesses in the area, said trained keepers arrived quickly on the scene to deal with the situation. He said: 'In Victoria there are over a dozen experienced beekeepers who have all been on an intense training course that focuses on the theory and practical training of urban beekeeping, successfully managing hives for nearly two years. 'Local beekeepers were able to respond swiftly to manage the swarm, collect them in a mobile hive and move them to a suitable location. Our ambassadors were also on site to reassure members of the public that the bees were not distressed.' Ruth Duston, CEO of Victoria BID, said local businesses kept bees to boost the area's biodiversity. She said: 'With a falling national bee population, the bees in Victoria play a key role in showing that London is a healthy, liveable city.' A swarm of 2,000 bees covered George Heal's Nissan Micra in Southsea . The angry swarm of bees which took up residence in a Nissan Micra were collected using a basket . Beekeeper Graham Cook rounds up the colony of bees that made George Heal's car their new home . Mrs Maclean, from BBKA, said: ‘They are doing . what honey bees do naturally and are not remotely interested in humans. 'In . fact before leaving their hive the bees fill up their stomachs with . honey and are rather mellow; their sole intention is to find a new home . to build-up a new colony. 'As . long as the swarm is not provoked it will not do any harm but it is . important that the bees are collected by an experienced beekeeper. 'If left . to their own devices they may choose to set up home in the nearest . convenient spot which could be a chimney or other inaccessible place.' The 20,000 angry bees swarmed the car in Southsea on Thursday . George Heal, 21, (left) a student at Portsmouth University found the bees settled in his car (right) She added that in central London people often keep bees on rooftops: 'The urban scene is not necessarily a paradise for bees. 'A . very high percentage of the urban area is barren bricks and mortar, . concrete and tarmac and many grassy open spaces offer little of interest . to bees, so forage is limited and consequently the number of hives that . can be sustained limited too,' she said. 'Another . key factor when keeping bees in towns and cities is the siting of hives . and their management to ensure that there is minimal nuisance to . neighbours and the general public. 'Proper . training in beekeeping skills is vital to be able to assess suitability . of apiary sites and to be able to manage colonies to minimise swarming . and the likelihood for stinging events involving the public.'","Bees landed on discount sign on window of Topshop in London's Victoria .

"The Lake District’s natural beauty and breathtaking views have made it one of the most admired landscapes in Europe, attracting legions of enthralled visitors who return year after year. But plans to relax planning restrictions on mobile phone masts and overhead cables could create a ‘free-for-all’ and leave Britain’s most beautiful areas ‘disfigured’, campaigners warned yesterday. Under controversial proposals contained in a Bill to be debated in Parliament, ministers would be allowed to fast-track the expansion of broadband and 4G in rural areas for at least the next five years. Ruined: A mobile phone mast planted in a picturesque field of rape seed could be a common sight fear campaigners . It means the Secretary of State would no longer be required to take into account an area’s natural beauty when deciding on the expansion of super-fast internet connection. The 4G network will see existing 2G and 3G sites upgraded as well as new phone masts being installed to expand the network. Critics yesterday condemned the proposal to relax planning restrictions as the biggest attack on national parks and areas of outstanding beauty in more than 50 years. They say the proposals make a mockery of the laws that first gave national parks their protected  status under Clement Attlee’s Labour government in 1949. Sir Andrew Motion, the former poet laureate and president of the Campaign for the Protection of Rural England, is understood to be against the proposals and lobbying privately to have them stopped. Natural beauty: Lake Ullswater in Cumbria in the Lake District National Park . The English National Park Authorities Association has also expressed alarm. A leaked internal document by the ENPAA brands the changes ‘unnecessary’ and warns of an outcry once they are made public. It adds: ‘We have seen no evidence that national park purposes have unduly hampered broadband or mobile communications delivery or justification for such a change to well-established legislation, and reject the inference that national park status has been a barrier to the roll-out of mobile/broadband technologies. ‘Parliament has established national parks with a clear purpose to protect their landscapes, wildlife and heritage and it is not appropriate to pick and choose when such protection should be afforded, and when not. ‘[It] is likely to give rise to a public reaction. This is likely to come in particular from concern about the Government’s commitment to landscape protection.’ Hilary Benn, shadow secretary of state for communities and local government, said the bill would create a ‘free-for-all’ that would ‘disfigure’ some of the most scenic parts of the country. He added: ‘This risks undermining a planning system that has effectively balanced protecting our national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty from  intrusive and ugly development while also ensuring that high speed internet can be rolled out throughout the country, including to  communities living in these areas.’ The advent of 4G – fourth generation wireless services – has been described by industry experts as the biggest technology launch the UK has ever seen. EE, the company behind T-Mobile and Orange, launched its 4G service last week. Customers are being promised speeds of between 8 and 12 megabits per second, as fast as the average home broadband connection. Rivals Vodafone, O2 and Three will be able to launch their own 4G services in May next year after a government spectrum auction.","Britain's most beautiful areas would be 'disfigured,' warn campaigners .

"A judge who praised burglars for their 'courage' before letting a serial offender walk free from court is facing an official investigation as David Cameron waded into the row. Judge Peter Bowers took the astonishing decision not to lock up Richard Rochford after saying that prison ‘very rarely does anybody any good’. ‘It takes a huge amount of courage, as far as I can see, for somebody to burgle somebody’s house,’ he told Rochford. ‘I wouldn’t have the nerve.’ Scroll down to see the interview . Ruckas: David Cameron used an interview on ITV this morning to attack a judge who freed a burglar, admitting that he has been burgled twice and the crime showed 'cowardice' Judge Bowers (left) faced heavy criticism for his decision not to lock up Richard Rochford (left) Rochford, 26, who could have been . jailed for two-and-a-half years, was instead handed a suspended 12-month . prison term.  ‘I’m going to take a chance on you,’ the 67-year-old . judge told him. The comments sparked a wave of anger . from victims and campaigners, and prompted criticism from the Prime . Minister, himself a victim of two burglaries, and Rochford’s own mother. Several complaints have been made to the Office for Judicial Complaints (OJC) which has launched an investigation. If the complaints are upheld, Judge Bowers could face disciplinary action. Sentencing: Rochford was given a suspended 12-month jail sentence at Teesside Crown Court . On ITV’s Daybreak programme, Mr . Cameron said he had not read the full details of the case but added: ‘I . am very clear that burglary is not bravery. Burglary is cowardice. Burglary is a hateful crime. People sometimes say it is not a violent . crime, but actually if you have been burgled, you do feel it was . violence. ‘I have a very clear view about this, . which is burglary is a despicable and hateful crime. People who . repeatedly burgle should be sent to prison.’ Tory MP Philip Davies criticised the . judge in the Commons, saying: ‘How can we ensure that idiots like that . do not remain in the judiciary?’ Rochford himself said last night said . he did not consider himself brave. The burglar said: ‘I feel bad for . what I did. It won’t make up for what I’ve done but I am sorry. ‘I don’t think burglary is a . courageous thing to do. I felt awful about it, to be honest, but I can . barely remember even doing it. I was on 60 to 70 valium tablets a day at . the time.’ Even Rochford’s mother failed to agree . with the judge. Caroline Whitehouse said: ‘To say what the judge said . is out of order. You don’t call a burglary courageous. I’m ashamed of . what he’s done. The judge shouldn’t have said that because it causes so . much trouble. It’s not courage – I think it’s wrong, it’s low to burgle . someone.’ Rochford admitted to a burglary spree . in February.

"With its thatched roof, manicured lawn and floral gardens it is the epitome of the chocolate box cottage. Only, the views outside are not that of an unspoilt countryside that goes on as far as the eye can see. There are no winding country lanes nearby. Nor are there acres of undulating greenery. Instead this sumptuous £3million property enjoys the most spectacular sea vistas imaginable. Perfect? This chocolate box English village cottage in Dorset is up for sale with a £3million asking price . Perched on a cliff-top in Christchurch, Dorset, potential buyers need only turn 180 degrees from the rural idyll of the cottage itself to take in the stunning views of the Solent. The unique combination means the four-bedroom detached property on Avon Run Road boasts the best of both worlds. And for estate agents - never lost for a word or two - its sale is ‘a once in a lifetime opportunity’. The cottage, which is just feet away from a sandy beach, has been owned for nearly 20 years by mother-of-two Sandy Hollowood. What a view! The four-bed detached cottage is perched on a cliff-top at Christchurch, Dorset, and enjoys magnificent views of the Solent and the Needles, pictured from the bottom of the garden . Great location: The property is on an exclusive row of properties a stone's throw from the beach and sea . During her time there Mrs Hollowood, 56, has received and rejected several informal offers from wealthy people turning up at her front door. But when her son and daughter left home she decided the time was right to downsize. Her 27-year-old son, Nick, is emigrating to Australia with his fiancee and she hopes the extra money generated from the sale will pay for regular trips Down Under. Mrs Hollowood said: ‘All the family have grown up and moved on and it doesn’t make sense for me to be rattling around a four bedroom house by myself. ‘I will be going to Australia to visit my son and this isn’t a house that should be left alone for long periods either. ‘It is a unique property. There used to be three thatched houses along this road but the other two have been pulled down and other houses built on the site.

Picture that: Imagine having this view over your garden fence... if you bought this property then you wouldn't have to . ‘It is a beautiful country cottage in a beautiful seaside location - you really have the best of both worlds. ‘I have been very lucky to have lived here for 19 years.’ Mrs Hollowood said she would begin searching for a smaller house in the area but would not return. The property is not grade listed and she fears whoever buys it may decide to tear it down in favour of rebuilding. ‘If whoever buys my house decides to knock it down and build something bigger in its place then that is their prerogative,’ she conceded. ‘That wouldn’t be my choice and I would not want to drive past it again because I want to keep my memory of it intact.’ Beautiful: The house is also full of original features that mean many people are not put off by its £3 million price tag . Stuart Mason, sales manager for estate agents Winkworth who are selling the property for Mrs Hollowood, said: ‘This is a once in a life time opportunity. ‘How often do you see what can only be described as one of the most attractive thatched cottages on a beach front with a truly fabulous sea view? ‘You will not find another thatched cottage on the seafront anywhere else. ‘It is the perfect combination of country and seaside living.’ The cottage has a lounge, dining room, study, four bedrooms with three having en suite bathrooms, a large conservatory and cottage gardens to the front and back.","The house is perched on top of a cliff in Dorset with views of the Solent and the Needles .

The woman's boyfriend, Jason Williams, told WSYR he saw her running naked outside their apartment and ran to grab their son, who McCarthy had been beating and trying to strip. In a recent spate of violent attacks across the country, alleged users of 'bath salts' have taken off their clothes, claiming the illegal synthetic drug causes them to burn up. As state troopers responded to the scene, other neighbours called to report she was becoming increasingly violent. One neighbour told WSYR: 'She was... just running back and forth around the street and . she got a hold of one of her dogs and she was rolling around on the . ground with her legs wrapped around it - she was strangling the dog.' Another said: 'She was definitely on something. Who does that?' When officers arrived at the scene, they found McCarthy was 'violently combative' and apparently under the influence of the drug, police said. 'High': McCarthy, left, allegedly punched and choked her three-year-old son before attacking neighbours and strangling her dog. Her boyfriend Jason Williams, right, grabbed the boy and ran . Scene: When McCarthy resisted police outside her home in Munnsville, New York, they used a Taser . Troopers said the woman growled at them as they approached her and claimed she tried to bite one of the officers. When trooper Christopher Budlong tried to . arrest McCarthy, she resisted. In an attempt to subdue her, he used . his police-issued pepper spray, but to no effect. He then deployed his Taser and was able to handcuff her. After she was taken into custody, she went into apparent cardiac arrest, police said. She was taken to hospital but later died. Williams said she had a history of drug abuse but was stunned to see her behaviour. 'I told her mom, ""She needs help"",' Williams told WSYR. 'Everyone says to get rid of her because I tell all mean stories. I got nothing good to say. I love her…love her to death…then I seen that.' Her . three-year-old son was taken by ambulance to Upstate University . Hospital in Syracuse and was treated for minor injuries. He is now with Williams's mother. Potent: McCarthy had allegedly taken bath salts, an illegal synthetic drug behind a spate of violent attacks . An autopsy on McCarthy will be carried out on Wednesday to determine the cause of the death. It is just the latest incident involving . bath salts, an illegal synthetic drug believed to be behind a recent outbreak of horrifying attacks. Bath . salts, a synthetic amphetamine cocktail known as 'the new LSD', was the . believed drug of choice for Rudy Eugene, who he chewed off homeless man . Ronald Poppo's face in Miami last month. A man in Louisiana, Carl Jacquneaux, was arrested when he bit off a piece of his neighbour's cheek, which a friend blamed on bath salts. And just this week, a man in North Miami allegedly stripped and exposed himself to a three-year-old girl in a park while on the drug. 'Bath salts' have been implicated in a recent spate of violent attacks across the country: . See below for video .","Neighbours called police to report Pamela McCarthy choking her son .

"He has lived to see 26 prime ministers, received seven telegrams from the Queen and was alive when the Wright brothers piloted the first powered plane in 1903. But Britain’s oldest man – who turns 110 tomorrow – says his longevity isn’t entirely down to his strict vegetarian diet or his favourite tipple, gin. The Reverend Reg Dean instead attributes it to a ‘mysterious brown-looking’ elixir of life given to him by a doctor when he was an army chaplain in India. Celebrations: Reg Dean celebrated his 110th birthday in November last year . ‘He said to me, “I have concocted a drink that will make you live for ever”, or something like that, and would I like to take it?’ he recalled yesterday. ‘Well I’m very naive, I can’t say no, so I drank it and here I am.’ The former teacher and church minister was born on November 4, 1902, in Tunstall, Staffordshire. Reflecting on all he has witnessed, he said: ‘I remember before the days of Tarmac, the roads were all dust heaps. ‘I can remember hearing about the sinking of the Titanic when I was at my uncle’s farm.’ Early years: Reg Dean pictured in 1903 aged 11 months and as a choirboy aged 12 .

"A family were forced to flee a packed holiday beach after thousands of bees swarmed inside their tent. Sunbathers took cover after the huge crowd of insects swooped on Porthmeor beach in St Ives, Cornwall. The estimated 10,000-strong swarm descended on a small sun tent and massed inside while the occupants scurried to safety. Scroll down for video . A family were forced to abandon their beach tent after a huge swarm of bees descended on it . The swarm was estimated to be about 2,000 strong as it swept across Porthmeor beach at St Ives in Cornwall . Sunbathers scattered while photographer Nick Pumphrey was on hand to capture the action . Lifeguards cordoned off the area and called in a beekeeper to collect the insects. The swarm was captured by surfing photographer Nick Pumphrey, who was on the beach to photograph a surf group in action but found himself among the many visitors forced to leave the area. Mr Pumphrey, 36, said: ‘I’d just uploaded some pictures to my website and had gone for a lie down on the beach when I heard a bit of a commotion. ‘I looked up and at first thought they were flies but they realised they were either wasps or bees. Experienced beekeeper Mike Leverton was called to assist lifeguards in collecting the insects . Mr Leverton from nearby village Lelant, swept the queen bee into a beekeepers box and waited for the swarm . It took about four hours for the whole swarm of bees to migrate into the box . ‘It was a bit frightening, they were about two feet above my head and were settling on the tent which was right next to us. I pretty much crawled out of there and then ran.’ Experienced beekeeper Mike Leverton, from nearby village Lelant, said he found as many as 10,000 bees buzzing around inside the abandoned beach tent. The retired fireman, 69, collected the swarm in a box before taking them to his home where he has around 60 hives and makes Cornish honey. He said: 'There was a good size swarm, probably between eight and ten thousand bees. 'When I got there the lifeguards had cordoned off the area of the beach. I scraped half of them into the box and then left the box in the tent for a few hours. 'The queen must have been in the box as when I returned a few hours later all the bees had gone in - they would have followed her scent.' Mr Leverton added: 'I presume the queen bee would have been tired for them to have all stopped on the tent. 'I've never been called to the beach to collect bees before, it's very rare.' Authorities said nobody was stung in the incident, which happened at about 1pm on Sunday. Beachgoer Nick Pumphrey initially thought the swarm of bees was a group of flies . The beach in St Ives was packed with holidaymakers making the most of the sunshine on Sunday . Spectators escaped without being stung as they watched the beekeeper collect the swarm .

"Simon Lack married Annette Hill in 2008 despite already having a wife in his home country of Canada . A wedding photographer who admitted being a bigamist has walked free from court after magistrates heard he is a regular churchgoer. Simon Lack, 44, married Canadian wife Tanya in 2002 before tying the knot with British bride Annette Hill six years later. Last month he pleaded guilty to bigamy at Northampton Magistrates' Court and was warned he faced a prison term when he appeared for sentencing. The maximum sentence for bigamy is seven years in prison, but magistrates today ordered him to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work and fined him a total of £145 after hearing character references from his church. The court heard Lack married  Tanya - who was his second wife - in Canada 12 years ago before moving to the UK. His unsuspecting wife later returned to their home country and Lack promised to follow once he had sold their possessions. But instead of returning to North America, Lack chose to remain in Northampton and his wife was unable to afford to get back to the UK. While he told his wife he was preparing to join her in Canada, Lack began seeing other women after joining internet dating websites. He started seeing Ms Hill, 51, in 2006 and they married in October 2008 while he was still wed to Tanya. Lack, who also had an ex-wife called Catherine, used his divorce papers from his first marriage to dupe Ms Hill, from Northampton, into believing his marriage to Tanya was over. The pair wed in a lavish ceremony at the Westone Manor Hotel in Northampton, with his new bride completely oblivious to his marital status. Lack was finally arrested after his wife, whom he left last October for another woman in Devon, became suspicious and called the police. He told police he did not think his second marriage, in Canada, 'was real' and his defence lawyer later told the court that he believed his second wife had 'sorted' the divorce . Lack has walked free from court despite admitting bigamy after magistrates heard he is a churchgoer . The court heard Lack met Ms Hill over the internet after his wife returned to Canada and he showed her papers from a previous divorce to dupe her into thinking he was no longer attached . Chairman of the bench Michael Billingham said: 'We have considered what has been said on your behalf. We have read your character references, including the one from your church. 'We note you are involved with the church and you will therefore be aware that marriage is a solemn vow. 'However we are going to go with the recommendation in the report and so you will complete 150 hours of unpaid work.' Angela Hudson, defending, said: 'Mr Lack has previous good character and he did plead guilty at the earliest opportunity, something which he should get credit for. 'He pleaded guilty because he accepts that he did not see or sign any paperwork to say that the marriage was null or void. 'There was no financial gain to marry and this was not for immigration purposes. In that regard, I think this brings down the severity of the case.' The pair organised a lavish ceremony at Westone Manor Hotel in Northampton in October 2008 . Lack later told police he did not think his second marriage, in Canada, was real and his defence team said he thought his Canadian wife had 'sorted' their divorce . She added: 'He has been extremely distressed about this, especially with the hype the case has received in the media. 'He is a gentleman who is working. He is an educated gentleman. He is a photographer. He is a member of the church. He is doing great things in the community. 'I think it is fair to say that Mr Lack realises he will be punished for this offence. 'The risk of re-offending is low and he is not a harm to the public. I would suggest that Mr Lack is not someone you will see here in court again.' Lack, who also works as wedding photographer and part-time as a double-glazing window salesman, refused to comment on the case outside court. Ms Hill and the couple's wedding guests were completely unaware of his marital status . The maximum sentence for bigamy is seven years but Lack was given a community sentence for his crime .","Simon Lack was first married in his twenties to a women called Catherine but they divorced .

"Health experts assembled by the White House conceded on Friday that a second case of Ebola could be identified in the U.S. But they defiantly insisted that the epidemic plaguing western Africa will not rise to the level of a major American outbreak. The deaths of approximately 3,500 people in western African nations are due to lax public health procedures and infrastructure – problems the United States doesn't face – according to National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases chief Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, Obama's homeland security assistant Lisa Monaco, HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell and U.S. Agency for International Development administrator Raj Shah. Fauci and Monaco specifically said there's no guarantee the sole American-diagnosed case of the illness in Texas will be the only one. 'We have a case now, and it's entirely conceivable there will be another case,' said Fauci. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Dr. Anthony Fauci (right), Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, said Ebola will create considerable fear among Americans – and there may be more cases . Biosecurity, Liberia style: Western African nations are woefully unprepared to contain the Ebola virus, experts said, without directly addressing the lapses that landed a single patient in Texas . 'But the reason that we feel confident is that our structure, our ability to do those things, would preclude an outbreak,' he said. Fauci told reporters that the African pandemic has erupted 'because the health care infrastructure and system' in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea 'is inadequate and incapable of actually handling the kind of identification, isolation, rapid treatment, protection of the people who are coming into contact, and contact tracing.' 'That's something that we have very, very well established here,' he declared. Monaco echoed him minutes later, saying that 'it is entirely possible we will see another case.' But the overall feeling of the sparsely attended afternoon press conference was one of complacency, with the Obama administration's top Ebola spear-catchers saying over and over that Americans have nothing to fear even though the government has no plans to close airports to planes originating in at the disease's ground-zero. 'The American people should be confident,' Monaco said, 'because the public health infrastructure we have here is so expert, is so extensive, and is considerable.' That confidence could come back to haunt the administration if a series of potential Ebola cases in Maryland, Hawaii, Kentucky and the District of Columbia turn out to be anything but false alarms. Fauci acknowledged that the fear associated with the virus, which kills more than half of the people it infects, will be a formidable public-relations obstacle if the situation worsens. 'There are many things when you have outbreaks,' he said. 'It's the unknown. It's the cataclysmic nature of it – namely, it's acute, it kills in a high percentage, and it kills quickly. That in and of itself, almost intuitively, makes people frightened.' He imagined his response to panicked Americans left wondering if they might be next. 'The other thing that makes people frightened,' he said, is: '""Can this happen to me without my even knowing it? Without my having any behavioral change at all?""' 'And that's the kind of thing that we have to keep over and over again emphasizing: We respect your concern, we understand your concern, but the evidence base tells us that that is not going to happen. And we have to say that a lot.' Fauci found himself pushing back against incredulous reporters who demanded to know why biosecurity lapses in the Texas case wouldn't repeat themselves. Lisa Monaco, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, conceded that the lone Ebola case in Texas might not be the last . The patient lied on his exit paperwork when he left Liberia, saying he hadn't been in contact with any contagious Ebola patients. In fact, he had carried a violently convulsing pregnant woman to safety only a day earlier. Once in the U.S., the first hospital that saw him sent him home with antibiotics after a clinician failed to note he had recently traveled to Texas from Africa. And it took more than two days for a hazardous materials crew to clean up the apartment where the man was staying after he was finally secured in an isolation ward. 'I never say I'm not concerned,' Fauci responded, 'because that's interpreted as taking something lightly. I take nothing lightly.' 'But I'm convinced,' he said 'that the system that's in place, with our health care infrastructure, that it would be extraordinarily unlikely that we would have an outbreak.' Speaking to journalists aboard Air Force One during a fundraising trip, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said President Obama has no immediate plans to respond personally to Americans' Ebola fears with a speech to soothe their nerves. 'Are we going to hear from him at all on the Ebola issue?' one reporter asked. 'Today, you mean?' Earnest responded. 'I don't anticipate that you will today.'","Press briefing told by two different experts that another case could be coming after a Liberian man brought Ebola to Texas .

"Unbowed: John Tulloch, 63, was a victim of the 7 July London bombings but faced deportation because he was born to British parents in India . A survivor of the July 7 terror attacks spoke yesterday of his relief after border officials dropped plans to deport him. Professor John Tulloch, who was born to British parents in colonial India, had had his passport confiscated and faced expulsion from the country. The 70-year-old university lecturer was told that as ‘a British subject without citizenship’ he was no longer entitled to remain. But after a public outcry he has been granted indefinite leave to stay and invited to apply for citizenship. He will then be able to get a new passport. Professor Tulloch said he was ‘thrilled’ by the U-turn. The threat of deportation had hurt him more than the 7/7 attack, he said. His bloodied and bandaged face became one of the defining images of the 2005 London bombings. Prince Charles visited him in hospital and said he exemplified the ‘resilience of the British people’. The decision to deny him the right to remain in the UK provoked widespread anger. MPs said it was ‘utterly wrong’ at a time when the likes of hate preacher Abu Qatada are allowed to stay on the grounds that deportation would infringe their human rights. Professor Tulloch – who married a British woman, has two British sons and can trace his British ancestry to the 14th century – called the decision to let him stay ‘incredible’. He said: ‘It’s just extraordinary. I am absolutely thrilled. I was banging my head against a wall trying to get this sorted out – I’d never before encountered so much frustration. It was like Kafka. ‘I phoned the UK Border Agency 15 times in one month alone, getting a different young person each time. You could never get anybody on the phone who understood the issues.’ Professor Tulloch’s British father served in Burma as a major in the Army, and his grandfather and great-grandfather both worked for the British government in India. Yet he was told there was no prospect of him being allowed to stay in the UK, let alone being considered for citizenship. Bloodied: Professor John Tulloch outside Edgware Road Tube station in London. He suffered serious injuries. Professor Tulloch was raised and educated in Britain from the age of three after his parents returned to the country with him. After a degree at Cambridge he embarked on an academic career and has held a series of posts at British universities. He owns the flat where he lives in Penarth, near Cardiff. But unknown to him his birth in colonial India meant he was classed as a ‘British subject without citizenship’. When Professor Tulloch was first issued with a British passport he said he was never told he did not have citizenship. Prince Charles talks to Mr Tulloch at St Mary's Hospital in London. The royal said he 'exemplified the resilience of the British people' He later accepted a job in Australia and was granted Australian citizenship. But . when he applied to renew his  passport it was confiscated and he was . told his right to live in Britain had been cancelled when he was granted . Australian citizenship. Outrage: The Daily Mail's September 3 headline . He was only able to return to the UK under a work permit. Professor Tulloch, head of the School of Journalism at Cardiff University, was later informed that he could not remain permanently. He was also denied the right to apply for naturalisation as a British citizen. Of the U-turn, he said: ‘The indefinite leave to remain is as much as I needed to function, but the passport is symbolic. ‘As much as anything, it’s what is due to my family. 'They would be so delighted that the service they gave is finally recognised.’ Last night the Home Office declined to comment. Professor Tulloch had been sitting opposite July 7 ringleader Mohammed Sidique Khan when the  suicide bomber detonated his explosives on a Tube train at Edgware Road. The academic suffered serious injuries to his ear drums and still has post-traumatic stress disorder.","John Tulloch - born to British parents in colonial India - faced deportation .

"Guilty: John Thompson (pictured) was imprisoned yesterday after blaming a seven-year-old girl for seducing him . A vile paedophile who blamed a girl of seven for seducing him was finally locked up yesterday - weeks after a judge let him walk free. John Thompson escaped a prison sentence in July despite pleading guilty to sexually assaulting his victim. Incredibly, he accused the schoolgirl of pinning him down on a bed after ‘flirting’ with him. Thompson narrowly avoided jail and was instead ordered to undergo a sex offender treatment programme. The lenient sentence imposed by Judge Gillian Matthews QC sparked fury among child protection charities who branded it ‘despicable’. Despite his remarkable let-off, Thompson was back in the dock last month for failing to comply with the same order - and yet again was given a second chance to change his ‘appalling attitude’. Now, having again failed to attend the sex offender treatment programme, he has been sent to prison. In a laughable attempt to avoid jail, he claimed he had missed one appointment with his probation worker because of a build-up of wax in his ears. Even when the retired brewery worker did show up to see his probation worker he was ‘hostile and uncooperative’, the court heard. Thompson remained adamant that the girl was a liar, demanded that she be punished and threatened to sue her for making the allegations, the hearing was told. Jailing Judge Gillian Matthews, QC, told him: ‘The only reason that I passed a suspended sentence was for you to take part in the sex offenders’ treatment programme. ‘Your views, in my judgement, are entrenched and dogmatic. You will not comply or co-operate. You will not accept your responsibility for this offence.’ Thompson, of Hartlepool, Cleveland, was jailed for eight months and had the supervision order against him revoked at Teesside Crown Court. His barrister, Lorraine Mustard, said: ‘It would appear that while he has tried to alter his attitude towards the offending, he has been unable to.’ Thompson first dodged jail in the summer after insisting he was unable to fight off the girl as she pinned him to a bed and forced her tongue into his mouth. Child protection charities were furious with the sentence imposed. They claimed an eight-month jail term, suspended for two years, was far too lenient. They described it as ‘outrageous’ and ‘unacceptable’ and claimed Thompson was ‘clearly a danger to society, and particularly to children’. Within a month, Thompson failed to turn up at a meeting with a probation worker - citing wax in his ears. He missed another meeting because ‘a window of his home was broken’. Nigel Soppitt, prosecuting, said officials from the Probation Service now considered the sex offenders order to be ‘completely unworkable’ because of Thompson’s terrible attitude. 'It is a culmination of these factors - the breaches, his attitude - that renders this order completely unworkable from their point of view,’ said Mr Soppitt. ‘This has to be viewed against a background of him feeling the sentence was unfair, calling the victim a liar and calling for her to be punished. ‘It worsened. He said he had been set up by his legal team and without DNA he should not have pleaded guilty.’ Judge Matthews dismissed his complaints about his lawyers and insisted that it and his desire to take legal action against the girl were ‘all classic traits of a paedophile’. Thompson’s barrister, Lorraine Mustard, said: ‘It would appear that while he has tried to alter his attitude towards the offending, he has been unable to.’ ‘It is quite clear that a build-up of wax in his ear was, perhaps, not the most convincing reason for failing to attend.’ ‘While there has been some change in his approach, the probation officer is quite clear that his views are entrenched and he remains dogmatic in the assertions he has made on more than one occasion.’ Thompson was placed on the sex offenders’ register and banned from having unsupervised contact with girls under 16.","John Thompson escaped a prison sentence in July despite pleading guilty .

"'Murdered': John Roberts, 32, was found dead at his home three days after appearing court . A loner was battered to death in his home after he appeared in court accused of abducting a young girl, police have said. John Roberts, 32, suffered fatal head injuries during the attack in his home on a run-down estate. Detectives are investigating the possibility that his murder was connected to the allegation against him. They are also examining his lifestyle and associates. Neighbours described Roberts as ‘an oddball’ whose home was often visited by teenage children. One said he was a drug dealer who had been seen handing things to youngsters from his front door. His body was found by police on Sunday evening. The last confirmed sighting of him was last Thursday. Roberts had appeared in Newcastle Crown Court over the alleged abduction of a girl of 14 on September 15 and his barrister indicated he would be entering a guilty plea. The neighbours also claimed that he was known for selling counterfeit cigarettes and fake replica football shirts. One of them, mother-of-four Nikki Hodgson, 38, said: ‘He was called Badge, because of the fake Newcastle United badge on his T-shirts. 'He was not a nice man. I did not like living across the road from him and I didn’t want him anywhere near my children. ‘He was a drug dealer. I have seen him giving drugs to teenagers. You often saw them knocking on his door and him handing them things.’ She said Roberts had removed the downstairs floorboards from his two-bedroom house in the Winlaton area of Gateshead. ‘I went round one day and when he opened the door, his head only just popped up above the bottom of the door frame,’ she added. ‘It was bizarre. ‘He lived entirely on the first floor. I’m not surprised something like this has happened, I’m only surprised it didn’t happen sooner.’ Search begins: Roberts was found dead at his terraced house just after 6pm on Sunday . Goodbye: Tributes were left at the home of the distinctive-looking Roberts, who was well known in the area . Gemma Ellis, a tourism and travel . student at Newcastle College who lived opposite Roberts, said: ‘He was a . bit of a loner. He was nice enough, but there was something a bit odd . about him. ‘There were a few people at his house quite often, they were of a similar age to him, maybe a bit younger. ‘You would often see him sitting . outside his house speaking to people who were passing. He hung around . with people who were in trouble with the police. ‘You kind of expected something to . happen, although perhaps nothing as serious as this. Young girls would . come and go from his house. They were maybe 17 or 18.’ Crime scene: He was found dead with head injuries after a hearing over whether he abducted a 14-year-old . Another neighbour, who did not wish . to be named, said: ‘There had been rumours going round that he had been . involved in an abduction. 'He was known to be seen with young girls in his house. ‘He would also hang around with undesirables.’ A section of the street has been . cordoned off by police since Sunday night and forensic scientists were . seen entering Roberts’ home yesterday. Vanished: Roberts had not been seen since the day of his court appearance in Newcastle . Later a white tent was erected outside the run-down terrace house and two police cars were parked outside. Lakhvir Kaur, 32, who works part time . at a nearby newsagents, said: ‘He was not very clean. His clothes were . ripped and he had long hair.’ Detectives are appealing for anyone . with any information to contact them by calling Northumbria Police on . 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. Detective Chief Inspector Christina . Barrett said: ‘Officers discovered John Roberts’ body inside his home . address on Sunday evening. Investigation: A white tent was set up outside the run-down terraced house while police conducted inquiries . 'His last confirmed sighting was on Thursday, December 13, and we need to trace his whereabouts since that day. We are keen to speak to anyone who . may have see Mr Roberts or spoken to him since Thursday, or anyone with . any information that could help us track his movements since he was last . seen.’ 'He is well known in the local area and quite distinctive looking due to his long hair and long beard. If anyone thinks they may have seen him since Thursday then I’d ask them to contact us. 'We have extra officers in the Winlaton area carrying out inquiries and speaking to residents. If anyone has any concerns or information that they wish to pass on face to face to officers then please speak to them.'
