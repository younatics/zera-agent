A grand jury in New Jersey has decided to let a woman who became an overnight sensation as ‘the tanning mom’ bronze away in peace. Prosecutors in Newark said Tuesday a grand jury refused to indict Patricia Krentcil on a charge she took her young daughter into a tanning booth with her. New Jersey state law bans children under 14 from using tanning salons. ‘We presented all the available evidence in the case to the grand jury, both the state's evidence and the defense's evidence,’ Assistant Prosecutor Gina Iosim stated in a press release. ‘The grand jurors voted not to indict Mrs. Krentcil. We respect their decision,'' she added. Spared: A grand jury in New Jersey refused to indict Patricia Krentcil on a charge she took her young daughter into a tanning booth . The 44-year-old Nutley woman was arrested last April and charged with second-degree child endangerment for allegedly bringing her then-five-year-old daughter into a tanning booth. Police became involved after school officials noticed burns on Krentcil's daughter's legs. Krentcil said that her daughter's burn came from staying in the sun in the backyard on an unusually warm day and that she would never take the girl into a tanning booth. The arrest generated wide publicity partly because of Krentcil's deep tan and professed love of tanning salons. Her instant fame even extended to a toy company making a ‘tanoerexic’ action figure based on her. The arrest and subsequent media frenzy also brought unwanted attention to the northern New Jersey tanning salon that Krentcil had frequented, and the salon incurred fines unrelated to the allegation against Krentcil. According to the Prosecutor's Office, Krentcil has been free on $25,000 bail. Her daughter remained in her parents’ custody while the jury deliberated. Prosecutors said the case is now over. Krentcil was arrested on the morning of April 24, 2012, and charged with child endangerment for allegedly taking her five-year-old daughter, Addison, to City Tropics tanning salon on Centre Street in Nutley. The 44-year-old has maintained her innocence, claiming that the entire episode was a big misunderstanding. According to CBS New York, Krentcil said when a school nurse asked her daughter how she got burns on her legs, the girl replied: 'I go tanning with mommy.' Following her arrest, the woman explained that she treated her trips to the tanning salon as an errand in which she brought her daughter along, but she insisted that the child had never been exposed to harmful UV rays. Living hell: Patricia Krentcil, pictured left, said her life had become 'a living hell' since she was arrested for allegedly taking her six-year-old daughter, right, to a salon last April . 'It's like taking your daughter to go food shopping,' she told NBC News. 'I tan, she doesn't tan. I'm in the booth, she's in the room. That's all there is to it.' The grand jury's decision to clear . Krentcil in the case comes just days after the ultra-bronzed woman . revealed her plan to escape her 'living hell' in New Jersey by moving to . rain-soaked London where she plans to launch her own tanning lotion - . and resume her favorite pastime. Krentcil, . 44, said her life had become unbearable since she was arrested for . allegedly taking her six-year-old daughter to a salon last April, and . subsequently banned from tanning beds across the tri-state area. 'It . is almost a year now since I was arrested and, no exaggeration, my life . has become a living hell. I can't sleep, I can't eat and all I do is . cry,' she said. The mother of five, who denies the charges against her, told the UK's The Sun . newspaper she's struggled to keep it together since being branded the . 'world's most evil mum' and has contemplated suicide over the past year. Her husband, Richard, 47, lost his job . on Wall Street and her children, including fair-skinned . four-year-old Addison, who sparked the controversy when her teacher . noticed burns on her body, have been bullied at school. She said they no longer wanted to be . seen with her because of the abuse hurled at them every time they go out . in public and added that her marriage was hanging on by a thread. But Krentcil, who was spotted dancing . provocatively at a New York nightclub earlier this month, wasn't . planning to give up her habit. Keeping it classy: A lighter-skinned Patricia Krentcil was photographed throwing back a glass of wine at XL Cabaret in New York City in August . Banned: Patricia Krentcil, pictured left and right, was banned from tanning beds across the tri-state area after her arrest . New life: Krentcil, pictured, said she hoped moving overseas would salvage her family . She said she was eager to take up . tanning again when she gets to England - where rules on sun beds are far . more relaxed than they are in the US. 'I was born to tan,' she told The . Sun. 'But in the past year I have been banned from tanning salons. Now I . have to spend hours covering myself in tanning lotion to get the color . I want.' However Krentcil, who last year was . cooking herself up to 20 times a month, told The New York Daily News the . move was more about escaping the pandemonium her arrest has caused than . finding a tanning salon that would take her business. 'I could go tanning if I wanted to. I just haven't,' she told the newspaper. She said she loved London and was hoping the move would salvage her family, adding that there was no future for in New Jersey. Take two: Krentcil, pictured, was recently spotted dancing at New York nightclub XL . Escape: But the woman wants to escape her hellish life in the US . Moving overseas was the only way she . and her family could find happiness again she said, adding that she is . looking forward to being anonymous in the UK where she believes people . are more educated and open-minded than they are in the US. According to The Sun, Krentcil is also planning to launch her own range of tanning products when she touches down. 'I want to start selling my own . tanning lotion there and I'm so excited about finally being able to . live my life in peace,' she told The Sun. Tanning Mom is facing charges of child endangerment, and if convicted could spend a decade in jail.

Scientists analysing data from a spacecraft orbiting the plan have been baffled by odd readings that showed unexplained chemical differences between rocks. Now they say the differences may have been caused by a vast ocean of magma that created layers of crystals, which melted then erupted. Scroll down for video . The amazing animation shows the surface of Mercury in unprecedented detail, with fresh craters next to massive ancient impact craters . Messenger (MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging) is the first spacecraft . ever to orbit the planet Mercury. The spacecraft's seven scientific . instruments and radio science investigation are unraveling the history . and evolution of the planet closest to the Sun. During its one-year . primary mission, Messenger acquired 88,746 images. It is now in an extended mission, during which plans . call for the acquisition of more than 80,000 additional image. Scientists at MIT have proposed that Mercury may have harbored a large, ocean of magma very early in its history, shortly after its formation about 4.5 billion years ago. The scientists analyzed data gathered by Messenger, a NASA probe that has orbited the planet since March 2011. Scientists analyzed X-ray fluorescence data from the probe, and identified two distinct compositions of rocks on the planet’s surface  -but were baffled by the differences. The MIT team used the compositional data to recreate the two rock types in the lab, and subjected each synthetic rock to high temperatures and pressures to simulate various geological processes. From their experiments, the scientists came up with only one phenomenon to explain the two compositions: a vast magma ocean that created two different layers of crystals, solidified, then eventually remelted into magma that then erupted onto Mercury’s surface. 'The thing that’s really amazing on . Mercury is, this didn’t happen yesterday,' said Timothy Grove, a . professor of geology at MIT. 'The crust is probably more than 4 billion years old, so this magma ocean is a really ancient feature.' The team translated the chemical . element ratios from the surface into the corresponding building blocks . that make up rocks, such as magnesium oxide, silicon dioxide and . aluminum oxide. The researchers then consulted what Grove refers to as a . 'pantry of oxides' — finely powdered chemicals — to recreate the rocks . in the lab. 'We just mix these together in the . right proportions and we’ve got a synthetic copy of what’s on the . surface of Mercury,' Grove says. The researchers then melted the . samples of synthetic rock in a furnace, cranking the heat up and down to . simulate geological processes that would cause crystals — and . eventually rocks — to form in the melt. Lava flows from Kilauea volcano: Experts say magma may have once covered the surface of Mercury, explaining the strange chemical composition of rocks on the surface . 'You can tell what would happen as the melt cools and crystals form and change the chemical composition of the remaining melted rock,' Grove says. 'The leftover melt changes composition.' After cooling the samples, the researchers picked out tiny crystals and melt pockets for analysis. Grove found the two compositions were . too different to have originated from the same region, and instead may . have come from two separate regions within the planet. The easiest explanation for what . created these distinct regions, Grove says, is a large magma ocean, . which over time likely formed different compositions of crystals as it . solidified. This molten ocean eventually remelted, spewing lava onto the surface of the planet in massive volcanic eruptions. The images reveal giant craters on the surface of Mercury seen in unprecedented detail. This basin's outer rim is about 306 km in diameter and the inner (peak) ring is about 140 km in diameter . Grove estimates that this magma ocean likely existed very early in Mercury’s existence — possibly within the first 1 million to 10 million years — and may have been created from the violent processes that formed the planet. As the solar nebula condensed, bits and pieces collided into larger chunks to form tiny, and then larger, planets. That process of colliding and accreting may produce enough energy to completely melt the planet — a scenario that would make an early magma ocean very feasible. 'The acquisition of data by spacecraft must be combined with laboratory experiments,' Charlier says. 'Although these data are valuable by themselves, experimental studies on these compositions enable scientists to reach the next level in the interpretation of planetary evolution.'","Surface believed to have been covered in large magma ocean which remelted several times .

"By . Jenny Hope Medical Correspondent . PUBLISHED: . 11:57 EST, 1 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:12 EST, 1 March 2013 . Price hike: The cost of a one-off prescription will rise to £7.85 from April 1st . Millions of patients will be left out of pocket as prescription charges in England rise by 20p next month. The price-hike, which will come into force on April 1, will bring the cost of a one-off prescription to £7.85. But although patients in England will be hit by the charge, those in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will continue to pay nothing. The prescription apartheid will mean thousands of English patients are forced to ‘choose’ which medication they can afford. Health Minister Earl Howe defended the rise announced yesterday, saying it helped save the NHS billions. He said patients needing more than one prescription a month were protected because the cost of a prescription pre-payment certificate - which allows people who have multiple prescriptions to pay a fixed cost over a period of three months or a year. But organisations representing long-term sick patients said the system was ‘arbitrary, outdated and inequitable’. Pharmacists also condemned the price increase, saying they had to watch poorer patients decide which prescriptions they needed most. The cost of a prescription prepayment certificate (PPC) will remain at £29.10 for a three month certificate.The annual cost will remain at £104. PPCs offer savings for those needing four or more items in three months or 14 or more items in one year. NHS dental charges will also increase on April 1 in England, with the charge for basic dental treatment rising 50p to £18. The value of NHS optical vouchers goes up one per cent to help with the cost of spectacles and contact lenses. Free prescriptions were introduced in Wales in 2007, Northern Ireland in 2010 and Scotland in 2011. Patients exempt from charges in England include children under 16, income-related benefit claimants and pregnant women. The charge for basic dental treatment will also rise 50p to £18 . The Prescription Charges Coalition, which represents more than 20 organisations, is campaigning to end ‘unfair’ prescription charges for people with long term medical conditions. David Barker, chief executive of Crohn’s and Colitis UK and spokesman for the Coalition, said millions of patients would be disappointed by the rise. He said ‘As a group of charities and organisations representing millions of people with long-term conditions, we know that prescription charges are arbitrary, outdated and inequitable, given that the list of exemptions has hardly been updated since its introduction in the 1960s. ‘Prescription charges have risen every year since 1979, and the Minister must consider the impact this further increase will have on those who are already struggling to afford the essential medication required to keep them well.’ He said the Coalition would publish a report later this month showing how society was paying too great a price for prescription charges. Joseph Clift, Policy Manager at the British Heart Foundation (BHF), said ‘Prescription charges in England should be free but instead people with heart disease are facing up to yet another increase. It’s an incredibly bitter pill to swallow. The prescription apartheid will mean thousands of English patients are forced to 'choose' which medication they can afford . ‘A freeze on the cost of prescription . prepayment certificates will offer some light relief but the growing . financial burden of expensive prescription charges cannot be ignored. ‘People living with heart disease, or at risk of the disease, should be focusing on getting better and keeping well not worrying about how they’re going to pay for their next vital prescription.’ Rob Darracott, chief executive of Pharmacy Voice, which represents pharmacists, said ‘We are disappointed with the increase; prescription charges deter many people from getting medicines which their doctor prescribes. ‘Patients on low incomes who do not qualify for exemption suffer the most. Patients often have to make the decision of what medicine they can take based on their finances. ‘From a pharmacist’s point of view, processing prescription levies is part of the job that adds workload but no patient benefit. Pharmacists, like other health care professionals, experience great pressures on their time and any release of time could be used to enhance patient care.’ Health minister Lord Howe said ‘The Government is investing more than £12.5 billion of extra money in the NHS and we are on course to save £5 billion over this financial year, all of which will be re-directed into front-line care. ‘In England, around 90 per cent of prescription items are dispensed free. We have also frozen the price of prescription pre-payment certificates for a further year, benefiting those who need multiple items. This means anyone who needs 14 or more prescription items in a year can get all the prescriptions they need for an average cost of £2 per week. ‘ .","On April 1 prescription charges will increase by 20p .

A frail pensioner endured a 12 hour wait on a hospital trolley as overworked nurses struggled in a ‘chaotic’ accident and emergency department. Betty Newberry, 88, was rushed to Worcester Royal Hospital by paramedics after a neighbour found her collapsed at her home last Friday. Upon arrival her at 9pm, doctors carried out initial tests and scans before the widow was taken back to A&E to wait for a hospital bed. Betty Newberry, 88, was left on a hospital trolley for 12 hours (pictured with neighbour, Councillor Joy Squires) Instead, she was left on a trolley in a tiny cubicle for a further 12 hours until she was finally admitted to a ward at 9.15 the following morning. Councillor Joy Squires, 58, who looks after Mrs Newberry, who is her neighbour, said that during this time nursing staff were forced to treat patients in corridors as the busy department filled up. At one point there were said to be six trolleys lined up next to each other as overworked staff struggled to cope. Cllr Squires said: ‘Betty was in a cubicle on the A&E ward, she was asleep most of the time and she kept waking up. ‘She was very confused and kept trying to get out of bed, I was able to make sure she didn't hurt herself. ‘It was unacceptable, I was shocked when I saw what was going on as I was unaware of what staff were facing. ‘I was shocked that there were trolleys in the corridor and people were being treated on them. Betty Newberry was rushed to Worcester Royal Hospital by paramedics after a neighbour found her collapsed at her home . ‘Having been there for a whole 12-hour shift I got to see just how much strain the staff are under.’ The Labour councillor now fears the hospital - which is expected to see an influx of emergency patients when the A&E at nearby Alexandra Hospital is downgraded - is already at breaking point. She added: ‘Based on my experiences I don't think the hospital has the capacity to handle the extra admissions.’ Mrs Newberry, who has no children, was said to be in a frail condition following her ordeal, during which she treated for a chest infection. Following a stay in hospital she was transferred to a local nursing home. Simon Trickett, chief operating officer for South Worcestershire Clinical Commissioning Group, said Mrs Newberry’s experience was 'extraordinary’.

Dulwich produced a mix of sharp attacking play and fierce defence to pip Hampton who dominated the second half after falling 8-0 behind. The way Dulwich played in the first half they looked set for a comfortable victory only to run out of steam in a highly-entertaining encounter at Broadstreet, the Coventry-based club who host the semi-finals in the world's biggest rugby tournament for schools.

As a frantic second half unfolded, Hampton tried to take advantage of sin bin offences for Dulwich forwards Billy Mostyn and Jeremy Reason. For a short period, Dulwich were reduced to 13 men and Hampton engineered a try for captain Alex Lundberg off a line-out drive. Fly half Tom MccGwire missed the conversion. Hampton looked set to dominate only for Dulwich to increase their lead again, thanks to a second penalty from centre Dom Fraser. Dulwich had played their best rugby in the first half and led from the 13th minute when Fraser landed his first penalty goal. Some excellent team play, including Dulwich’s trademark forward drives, eventually cracked open the Hampton defence in the 20th minute, full-back Ali Neden speeding on to Fraser’s pass to score in the left corner. Fraser missed the conversion but Dulwich’s 8-0 lead proved significant as the match unfolded, Hampton finding their rhythm. Dulwich spent the vast majority of the second half on the defence, successfully snuffing out repeated Hampton attacks. Close defeat: Alex Lundberg goes over for a Hampton try . Challenge: Hampton's Alex Tavener runs into Dulwich's Dom Fraser . Centre Alex Taverner looked certain to score only for referee Dean Richards to adjudge that the Hampton player had been held up by Dulwich defenders. ‘It was the classic game of two halves,’ smiled a relieved Dulwich coach Sam Howard afterwards. ‘It’s a cliché but true. ‘In the second half we just forget how to attack and decided to defend. We did manage to grab three points when we were down to 14 men and that proved crucial. Overall, it was a good game and a credit to both teams. ‘ . Fraser accepted the combined tackle by captain Dom Wroe Wright and Neden on Taverner had been a big turning point. ‘That was a great moment and epitomised our team and the way we play for each other,’ he said.

A dramatic late surge in the second half secured Northampton Schools for Boys a first appearance in a Twickenham final. Warwick led 10-0 early in the second half of a nervous contest and looked set to continue in the footsteps of the school’s 2007 team who beat Barnard Castle in the final. But NSB ultimately proved stronger after overcoming a spate of handling errors which had ruined a number of attacks. Warwick were 3-0 ahead at half-time, thanks to a penalty by full-back Joshua Hickman, and extended the lead three minutes after the break when scrum-half Andrew Rusher galloped clear off an interception near halfway. Hickman converted to give Warwick a 10-0 lead which was reduced by Bullivant’s first penalty, the fly half having missed two kicks in the first half. That taste of success gave Bullivant new confidence and he led NSB’s resurgence in the closing stages which culminated in him helping to set up Hartfield’s try, the flanker wriggling clear of Warwick defenders. Bullivant converted to level the match at 10-10. To add to Warwick’s worries No 16 Kurt Jenkins was sin binned soon afterwards and a further penalty, a minute later, brought the fly half’s winning kick. Running clear: Ollie Hartfield goes on a try scoring run for Northampton . Going forward: Devon Barrington on the attack for Warwick . Mark Lee, the long-serving head of rugby at NSB, said he feared his team were stumbling to defeat when they went 10-0 down. ‘We were starting to think it was a ‘bridge too far’ but we had to get on that scoreboard. Warwick are a good side but I never thought they were going to carve us up out wide. ‘We just needed to get some points in order to develop some confidence. We looked brilliant over on the back field in the warm up, but as soon as the opposition came on all that changed,’ he joked. ‘But the way we fought back was testimony to this side’s guts and determination. A Twickenham final is just fantastic.’ As a state school, NSB will be looking to become the first from the sector since Exeter College in 2005 to lift the Under 18s Cup.

Mobile phones are the fastest growing area of Google's business - yet co-founder Sergey Brin has said he thinks they are 'emasculating' users. The Google boss told a stunned audience at the TED conference in Long Beach he believed phone users were 'hunched up, looking down, rubbing a featureless piece of glass'. 'It’s kind of emasculating,' he said. 'Is this what you’re meant to do with your body?' Google co-founder Sergey Brin wearing his Google Glass computer. Today he said the experience of using a smartphone was 'emasculating' He claims the answer, perhaps unsurprisingly, is Google's much-publicised . Glass project, a £1,000 wearable computer set to go on sale this year. 'When we started Google 15 years ago,' Brin said, 'my vision was that information would come to you as you need it. Fears are brewing that the next . generation of wearable mobile devices, like Google's Project Glass, . could pose a serious cancer risk. The . futuristic Google gadget is practically useless unless it is connected . to the internet to deliver search results, provide turn-by-turn . directions, and upload images. To connect on its own, this would require them to be fitted with cellular radios, which emit radiation that studies have claimed could be carcinogenic. Prototypes of Glass do not have the ability to connect to mobile networks . themselves. The face-based computers can only . access the internet through a wireless Bluetooth connection to the . wearer's smart phone. That could be because the power draw . of cellular radios is so high that fitting one would require a heavy battery. But the jury is still out on claims that the frequencies they use may . be carcinogenic. Previous studies have found low-level . electromagnetic field exposure from mobiles and other transmitting . devices could cause harmful heating of tissue, male infertility and . cancer. 'You wouldn’t have to search query at all.' However, he claims the reality has proved to be very different. 'Is this the way you’re meant to interact with other people? Is the future of connection just people walking around hunched up, looking down, rubbing a featureless piece of glass?' 'It’s kind of emasculating. Is this what you’re meant to do with your body?' Brin also revealed his own mobile phone addiction during the talk. 'I have a nervous tic,' he said. 'The cell phone is a nervous habit. If I smoked, I’d probably smoke instead, It’d look cooler. 'But I whip this out and look as if I have something important to do. 'It really opened my eyes to how much of my life I spent secluding myself away in email.' Brin's comments have also provoked anger online. 'We’re taking advice on cool from this guy? Seriously?' said John Gruber on the tech blog daringfireball.net. 'I can see the argument that dicking around with our phones in public is not cool, that we should pay more attention to our companions and surroundings, and less to our computer displays. 'Strapping a computer display to your face is not the answer.' Some also believe Brin simply used the wrong word. 'If only there were some kind of electronic search service that Sergey Brin could use to look up the meaning of 'emasculating',' said Duke University sociology professor Kieran Healy on twitter. Brin wears Google Glass glasses at an announcement for the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences - he is rarely pictured without them. Brin also  warned fans keen to get their hands on Glass not to trust eBay listing purporting to offer prototypes for the augmented reality spectacles. His comments came after a seller on the auction site put up what was claimed to be an early version of the gadget with a reserve of nearly $16,000. 'I would trust eBay, by the way, but not that particular post,' he said. Mr Brin also had good news for those keenly awaiting the launch of Glass, with a promise that it would be available to the public for less than $1,500 later this year. Google has revealed for the first time what wearers of its Glass computer will see. Here, a message is received and displayed on screen. Users can speak to reply . The new video reveals how Google glass could be used - including this video chat between a users holding a snake and a young child shocked by the animal . The hotly anticipated glasses allow wearers to see sat-nav directions, take pictures and reply to emails - but until last week Google had refused to show how they actually work. 'Want to see how Glass actually feels? It's surprisingly simple,' Google said. 'Say 'take a picture' to take a picture. 'Record what you see, hands free. Even share what you see, live. Directions are right in front of you. The firm also said all of the footage was captured through Glass. Project Glass will come in five colours - black, gray, blue, red or white and have removable shades. The company is negotiating with Warby Parker, an e-commerce start-up company that sells trendy eyeglasses, to help it design more fashionable frames, according to the New York Times.","Billionaire Brin claimed that using phones was a 'nervous tic'

Britain is set to enjoy a mini spring heatwave this week, but make the most of it as the mercury is set to drop by the weekend. Met Office forecasters predict temperatures could climb to 13C by the middle of the week, higher than the average for this time of year. But they warned the UK won't be basking in bright sunshine for long as the higher temperatures will bring more rain later in the week. Fire and ice: A gamekeeper checks the flames as heather is kept young and tidy by controlled burning carried out between September and April every year, on the Invercauld Estate near Braemar, Aberdeenshire . On fire: The annual burning, or 'swiping' is usually carried out when the heather starts to dry but the peat is still wet - but the keeper had to contend with unusual weather conditions - there was still snow on the highlands . While much of the UK has begun to enjoy . the spring-like weather, one moor keeper braved bleak temperatures, snow . and ice to tend to his heather. Dramatic pictures show the keeper, on the Invercauld Estate, near Braemar, Aberdeenshire, burning the heather to keep it young and healthy. The annual practice, known as swiping, is normally carried out when the weather starts to improve and the heather is dry while the peat is wet. But with freezing temperatures of late, and snow and ice still on the ground in the highlands, the keeper was forced to mix fire and ice, burning his heather in difficult weather conditions. Healthy: Heather burning is a traditional management tool which if carried out can regenerate healthier and benefit livestock and wildlife .

'Today, Monday and Tuesday, it is looking mostly dry across the majority of the country with varying amounts of cloud and sunshine depending where you are.

Eight out of ten are denied the chance of basic treatment simply on the basis of their age. Those over 70 who are diagnosed with the disease have only a one-in-seven chance of receiving the chemotherapy that is the standard approach for younger patients. This means potentially lifesaving drugs are denied to women purely because they are regarded as too old, rather than whether they are fit enough or could benefit from treatment. Britain’s survival rates for breast cancer are also alarmingly behind those of other developed nations. Eight out of ten are denied the chance of basic treatment for breast cancer simply on the basis of their age . For women over 70, the gap in survival rates between the UK and Sweden stretches to 12 per cent. Last night experts said the figures, from two separate studies, showed that older women were not being treated in a ‘fair and equal way’ by the NHS. Baroness Delyth Morgan, chief executive of the charity Breast Cancer Campaign, said: ‘As nearly a third of new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed in women over 70, with this set to rise due to an ageing population, it’s vital that a consistent standard of care is given to every woman, whatever her age.’ The first study, from the University of Sussex, and Brighton & Sussex Medical School, shows just 14 per cent of patients over 70 with early breast cancer are offered chemotherapy after surgery. Chemotherapy after surgery is considered standard for younger patients . This treatment is considered standard for younger patients. Older . women could also be missing out on the benefits of the ‘wonder’ drug . Herceptin because it works better when used in combination with . chemotherapy. And in nearly a . third of cases, doctors decide how to treat patients over 70 without . recording their fitness or testing their so-called HER2 status, to see . if they are among the one in five who might respond to Herceptin. The most shocking finding was that of the 45 per cent of patients at high risk of breast cancer returning, less than a third were offered chemotherapy. Some hospitals did not give chemotherapy to any patient over 70, the research, funded by drug company Roche, found. Professor Lesley Fallowfield, of the University of Sussex, said: ‘Elderly breast cancer patients should be assessed in the same way that younger patients are, based on their fitness and HER2 status, without prejudice or unreasonably ageist perceptions. This is essential information, and without it, you may as well guess as to the most appropriate treatment. ‘National guidelines need to be developed if elderly patients are to receive fair and equal assessment of their treatment requirements in future.’ The second study, published in the British Journal of Cancer, says although women under 70 have better survival rates everywhere for breast cancer, in the UK the gap between the chances of younger and older patients is the most marked. Just 42 per cent of British women over 70 who are diagnosed with advanced breast cancer live for another year – compared with 60 per cent of younger women battling the disease. The figures, from a study at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and using data from 257,362 women diagnosed between 2000 and 2007 –  suggest that those over 70 are missing out on more aggressive treatments. Lead researcher Dr Sarah Walters said the latest figures suggest that the UK should ‘investigate whether the treatment of women with later-stage breast cancer meets international standards’. ‘There is particular concern that this is not the case, especially for older women,’ she said. Sara Hiom, Cancer Research UK’s director of early diagnosis, said Britain  was starting to close the survival gap with other countries, but patients here ‘continue to fare worse’. ‘We know that UK women diagnosed with breast cancer are not routinely given CT scans to check if the disease has spread, which could mean we aren’t always accurately staging more advanced disease,’ she said. ‘But we also need to investigate the possibility that fewer women with later stage breast cancer in the UK receive the best treatment for their circumstances.’ The charity Breakthrough Breast Cancer and a cross-party group of MPs are working on an inquiry into the treatment of older people with breast cancer. The charity says they are missing out on the advances in radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery over the last ten years that have so dramatically improved the survival chances of younger patients. MP Steve Brine said: ‘We are deeply concerned by suggestions that older breast cancer patients are being denied access to the full treatment and support options that are available purely as a result of their age.’ Dr Rachel Greig, from Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: ‘We already know that the number of women over 70 receiving chemotherapy is low. ‘What is a cause for concern, in the study, is that in some cases treatment decisions were made without data on HER2 status. This information could have changed the way the patient was treated.’ Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘This study will help us keep improving breast cancer treatment as part of our cancer strategy to save an extra 5,000 lives a year by 2014. ‘The NHS is also working to ensure all patients are treated as individuals and receive care that meets their healthcare needs whatever their age or condition.’","Experts said older women not treated in a 'fair and equal way' by the NHS .

One of the country's oldest cricket clubs could go out of business because of a costly legal dispute with the director of a prestigious drama school - over a tiny patch of land. Charlton Kings Cricket Club, which was founded in 1885, has been locked in a lengthy High Court battle with widow Jacki Mitchell, 63, who claims that the patch of land - just 1,618 square metres in size - at the club belonged to her late husband Henry Arthur Mitchell. But the club, based in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, claims that it has been using the patch as an outfield area for more than a century. Lengthy dispute: Jacki Mitchell, a director at the Millennium Performing Arts school, left, has been locked in an 18-month court battle with Charlton Kings Cricket Club. The club's director Geoff White is pictured, right . Long history: The club has been playing at the ground in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire since its formation in 1885 . Tiny: The patch of land which the cricket club and Mrs Mitchell are fighting over represents a fifth of the total land of the club . US-born Mrs Mitchell, a director of the Millennium Performing Arts school in Woolwich, London, staked a claim for the land - which represents a fifth of the Ryeworth Fields site - following the death of her husband. The area of land is just 0.4 acres or 1,618 square metres in size. To put that into context, the size of the field at Melbourne Cricket Ground in Australia - one of the world's most famous cricket venues - is around 20,000 square metres. The club has already shelled out £80,000 contesting the land and trustees say that it could go out of business if the judge rules against them. The 18-month wrangle almost ended at the High Court in Birmingham on Friday after a four day trial, but a last minute legal point meant that judge Mr Justice Morgan was unable to bring the case to a fair conclusion. The trial will now be halted for two months while legal teams look into an apparent tenancy agreement between the club and the land owners drawn up in 1947. He told the court: 'It is a distinct change at the last moment. It would be unfair to proceed. 'I’m quite sure that if I take a decision today I’m going to produce a result that is not in accordance with the correct legal position. 'I think both of you are very vulnerable to the wrong answer emerging. At risk: Trustees of the cricket club say that it could be forced out of business if it loses the High Court case . 'Both would be better off if the point was explored directly with each side able to put forward a fully-considered final position with any evidence.' The judge added that he regretted the delay but had no choice but to put the case back. He added: 'It is very untidy and I’m not saying anything about how this has come about but we have got to the point where I’m going to adjourn the matter part heard with the expectation being that the matter will be the subject of a further one to two day hearing.' Speaking after Friday’s hearing, the club’s cricket development officer Geoff White expressed his frustration at the delay. He said: 'It’s an incredibly frustrating situation for everybody, we are very disappointed.

Hold up: The battle over the patch of land has been delayed after an old agreement between the owner and the club came to light .

The Commons expenses watchdog last night rebuked a Tory MP for writing 'abusive and offensive' messages to its staff. Backbencher Karl McCartney was accused of adding notes to claims, telling one official they were 'talking sh*te', and condemning another as a 'pedantic SOAB'. The criticism came just hours after Mr McCartney claimed he was the victim of 'bullying tactics' by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa). Ipsa chief executive Andrew McDonald, right, said Lincoln MP Karl McCartney, left, called one expense watchdog official a 'pedantic SOAB' and wrote other 'offensive, abusive and condescending' notes . During Business Questions in the House today, Mr McCartney accused Ipsa chief executive Andrew McDonald of using 'false innuendo and subterfuge' to smear the name of politicians. 'What do you think that subsequent to me raising these issues of Ipsa's senior management's bullying tactics and threats to try and silence me regarding their spiralling costs?' the Lincoln MP asked Leader of the House Andrew Lansley. 'Do you think that their chief executive should show some backbone and meet with me as he refused to do so for over two and a half years, instead of attempting to smear Members of Parliament's names by false innuendo and subterfuge?' However, in a letter this evening, Mr McDonald denied the bullying allegations and insisted Ipsa was providing good value to the taxpayer. He went on: 'Some of the notes written by you, and attached to your claims, were recently brought to my attention. 'Having reviewed those notes, I was taken aback by the content, which ranged from the abusive (""you are a pedantic SOAB, aren't you?"") through to the offensive (""you're talking sh*te"") and on to the condescending (""simples - or didn't you do geography at Eton and Oxford...""). 'We will do all that is reasonable to shield our team from such treatment. This policy and its application in your case have been expressly endorsed by the Board. 'I had hoped it would be possible to address this behaviour without writing to you formally. In the light of your comments today, I write to ask that you conduct your dealings with us - orally or in writing - in civil terms. After Mr McCartney's question in the Commons, Speaker John Bercow said MPs 'must really play the rules' 'I do not ask you to like Ipsa or its policies. At the same time, Ipsa's team deserves to be treated in a courteous manner. I ask that, with immediate effect, you desist from correspondence which falls below this standard.' Mr McDonald went on to reject the MP's claims that Ipsa was profligate, pointing out that its administration costs represent just 3.4 per cent of the £176milion public money it administers; and that it is delivering savings of more than 5 per cent a year. 'Any discussion of our costs should, I suggest, be informed by a full understanding of our role and responsibilities,' he said. 'Given your recent public reference to communication between yourself and Ipsa, I am publishing this letter.' Last night Lucy Rigby, Labour's candidate for Lincoln, said: 'It is absolutely and genuinely shocking that Lincoln's MP would use this kind of language in letters to any body or organisation. 'I think voters in Lincoln will be appalled that they are being represented by someone who's obviously abusive, can't control himself and has no idea what kind of behaviour is appropriate for a Member of Parliament. This is embarrassing for Lincoln and Mr McCartney needs to apologise immediately.' Mr McCartney, who was first elected in 2010, has attracted criticism for his offensive views on gay marriage. In a letter to a constituent, he said he felt it would lead to 'multi-partnership marriages and a reduction in the age of permitted marriage'. After he raised the issue in the Commons earlier, Speaker John Bercow ruled that Mr McCartney's point was not a business question. Mr Bercow said he should have requested a statement or a debate, saying: 'Members must really play by the rules and not invent them as they go along.' Responding to the backbencher, Mr Lansley said: 'If it's helpful to the House, I will of course be happy to meet you and as a member, Mr Speaker, of your committee on Ipsa, I will be glad to take forward any issues you have.' Mr McCartney was unavailable for comment last night.","Backbencher Karl McCartney accused of writing abusive notes to watchdog .

Britain's bloated aid and climate change ministries have gone on a multi-million-pound recruitment spree since the last election. The Department for International Development, which dishes out overseas aid, has employed in excess of 150 extra members of staff at a cost of more than £10million a year. And despite David Cameron’s austerity drive, the Government has found the money to take on an extra 264 staff at the Department for Energy and Climate Change, with the roll call soaring by more than a quarter since 2010. Big spender: The Department for International Development (pictured) has employed over 150 extra members of staff at a cost of over £10million a year . Their profligacy comes while other Whitehall ministries have had to make drastic cuts to bring down the deficit, leading to frontline services being slashed. Both the Department for International Development (DfID) and the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) said their staff numbers had to rise so quickly to meet government ‘targets’. At DECC, the total has increased by 26 per cent from 1,022 in April 2010 – just before the last election – to 1,286 in April last year, official figures released following a Parliamentary question reveal. The increase is even more startling when compared to April 2009 when just 768 were employed at the department. Since the election, DfID has swelled its ranks by 10 per cent. The 1,619 members of staff in December 2010 had increased to 1,773 by December 2012. Figures released in the Lords last week show that in 2010/11, the total cost of DfID’s staff bill was £93.4million. The expected 2012/13 figure will be around £104.1million. Priti Patel (pictured) obtained the figures and spoke up for families in the UK who are making sacrifices . The news will outrage Tory backbenchers who have called on the Government to scrap its pledge to spend 0.7 per cent of national output on overseas aid, and abandon its obsession with wind power. Priti Patel, the Conservative MP who obtained the figures following Parliamentary questions, said: ‘Families up and down the country making sacrifices and having their living standards squeezed will be astonished to see low priority government departments spending their hard-earned taxes on more staff. ‘The civil service needs to become more efficient and effective at deploying the resources it has. During these tough economic times government departments should be leading the way by reducing their sizes not taking taxpayers for granted and bringing in more bureaucrats.’ Three other departments – Work and Pensions, the Cabinet Office and Wales – have also seen staff rises, although this is because staff from abolished quangos went to work for the core department. Critics said that if an organisation was worthy of abolition, its jobs should go too – otherwise people would believe the ‘bonfire of the quangos’ was little more than a damp squib. A spokesman for DfID said that its . extra staff were not bureaucrats sitting in Whitehall but people working . on the frontline in poor countries. She . added: ‘DfID has cut 30 per cent from its admin budget. Since 2010 the . department has undergone major restructuring involving recruitment of . additional frontline staff to make sure our development programmes are . delivered efficiently as we reach the 0.7 per cent target.’ A . DECC spokesman said: ‘DECC has a challenging and important agenda, and . the posts that have been filled are necessary to enable us to meet those . targets.’ A Cabinet Office . spokesman said that overall, the number of civil servants across . Whitehall stands at 420,000 – a post-war low and down 15 per cent since . the election. Concerns: Justine Greening . Aid to Rwanda will be funnelled through charities rather than the country’s scandal-hit government, Justine Greening said yesterday. The International Development Secretary said the UK will give £16million to Rwanda, after earlier halting the aid because of the central African state’s support for brutal rebels in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The money will not be paid directly to the Rwandan treasury as initially planned but instead to aid agencies in the country. The announcement comes six months after Miss Greening’s predecessor, Andrew Mitchell, reinstated payments to the Rwandan government despite growing human rights concerns. On his last day in the job he authorised £8million as direct support to the government, and diverted the other half to specific development programmes. He acted despite a UN report last July highlighting Rwanda’s role in backing insurgents in DRC. Miss Greening decided in November to withhold the money amid renewed concerns about Rwanda president Paul Kagame’s actions. Violence in Congo has been spiralling, with reports of summary executions being carried out by the rebel M23 group. Miss Greening said £16million would now be paid in to Rwanda but not through its government. Some of the cash will also be paid into a ringfenced fund which will be divided among the country’s poorest workers. Miss Greening said money would provide work opportunities for 545,000, support essential services, fund 1.8million school books and help 20,000 refugees in camps on the Rwanda side of the border with Congo.","Department for International Development employed over 150 extra members for more than £10million a year .

More than 20 per cent of Britons sleep poorly most nights (file picture) Millions of us are struggling to get enough sleep, a study has found – and it’s putting our health at risk. Two out of five Britons fail to get six hours a night, the minimum experts say we need for physical and mental wellbeing. This number has soared in the past three years. One in three of us now manages on five to six hours a night, compared with 27 per cent in 2010. Three quarters sleep for seven hours or fewer. Almost half of Britons say stress or worry keeps them awake at night, according to a report published today by The Sleep Council. More than 5,000 people were surveyed about their sleeping habits in The Great British Bedtime Report. It found the average Briton goes to bed at 11.15pm and gets six hours and 35 minutes sleep per night. Research suggests seven and a half hours is the optimum level for good health. Earlier this week scientists at Surrey University revealed that just seven days of poor sleep can disrupt hundreds of genes linked to stress, immunity and inflammation. Dr Chris Idzikowski, director of the Edinburgh Sleep Centre, said worsening sleep habits were a ‘significant’ cause for concern. He said: ‘Disrupted sleep not only impacts on quality of life but there’s an increased risk of higher blood pressure, heart attacks and strokes. ‘Many studies in recent years have concluded there is a higher death rate linked with less than five and a half hours sleep a night and more than nine and a half. ‘It’s still not clear why, but deterioration in people’s thinking ability alone can occur after just one night of poor sleep.’ He said growing levels of obesity may be partly to blame, with associated health problems stopping those affected – and often their partners – from sleeping properly. The economic situation isn’t helping either. Dr Idzikowski added: ‘If people lose their job, it can affect sleeping habits, while others may lie awake at night worrying about losing their jobs.’ Forty-seven per cent of the adults questioned in The Sleep Council’s report said stress or worry was stopping them from getting a good night’s sleep. That figure was far higher for women and singles, at 54 per cent and 57 per cent respectively. For men, it was 40 per cent. The study found 22 per cent of Britons were sleeping poorly most nights and that men appear to enjoy better-quality sleep than women, with 30 per cent sleeping very well, compared with 22 per cent of women. High earners get the best sleep of all. More than a third of those earning £65,000 – £75,000 said they slept very well, while 10 per cent of those earning less than £15,000 said they slept very poorly.","Higher earners sleep more soundly than those on a low income .

A job hunter has tasted sweet success in the employment market thanks to his unique CV made to look like a chocolate bar label. Nick Begley, from New York, sent in his 'resume bar' as an application for 12 jobs with his skills printed under the 'ingredients' section of the wrapper. The 32-year-old also replaced the nutritional information with boasts about his skills, including a 100 per cent daily value in qualities such as motivation, leadership and creativity and 110 per cent for his work ethic. Sweet: Nick Begley, of New York, landed the job using this chocolate bar CV . Nick Begley sent in his 'resume bar' as an application for 12 jobs with his skills printed under the 'ingredients' section of the wrapper . He sold himself on the bar as an 'experienced marketing professional' with a serving size of '1 career' and used the tagline 'Credentials that will satisfy any organization’s appetite'. The labels were subsequently wrapped around 12 bars and sent off to prospective employers after he completed his MBA at the University of Central Florida in 2009. This week, his friend, Eli Langer, posted a photo of the bar on Reddit, where it has received more than 3,200 comments. The approach has worked for Mr Begley twice in three months - one time to earn an internship and the other to secure a marketing job with LeagueApps, a platform that connects adult recreational athletes. Mr Begley told ABC News: 'People are either going to love or hate it. 'My focus was to find an organisation that would embrace it, because if they weren't open to that kind of out-of-the-box thinking, that wouldn't be a company that I would fit in well with anyways.' Instead of waiting in line for a job, Nick Begley took matters into his own hands and created a unique CV . Mr Begley had already found an organisation, the Orlando Magic basketball franchise, that embraced his creativity while in graduate school. The team hired him for a summer internship after receiving a 'ResumeBar,' which gave Mr Begley all the confidence he needed to try it again. Mr Begley, who also once had his resume delivered along with a pizza, said his brother, Jeremy, designed the label for him and he had it printed at Kinko’s. He put the label on top of a standard Nestle Crunch bar, making his resume not-so-ordinary for less than $2.50 per bar. 'Of course,' Mr Begley said when asked by ABC News if it was worth it. 'It was creative and put me ahead [with potential employers] as far as understanding that I was willing to go the extra mile.' Mr Begley now works for a Toronto-based e-commerce entertainment company, a job he found the old-fashioned way. 'I was recruited by someone I used to work with,' he said.","Nick Begley, from New York, sent in his 'resume bar' for two jobs .

A moving advertising campaign showing the last moments of life will be screened on television for the first time tonight . The short film - which uses actors - is one part of a £1million campaign and will screen for this first time tonight during a break in ITV's Emmerdale. It opens with scenes showing important keystones in life - a child's first steps, a baby's first birthday, a teenage couple's tentative first kiss, a young boy's awkward first shave. It is cut with emotional scenes of a couple - one of whom is dying - sharing a tender last moment, a dying man on a bed, his chin being gently shaved by a nurse, and a faithful dog resting his head on the knee of his dying master. It was directed by Tom Tagholm, the man behind the ‘Meet The Superhumans’ film for the Paralympic advertising campaign. He has been widely credited with de-stigmatising disability and injecting glamour into sport for disabled people. The touching advert, entitled Symmetry, compares the end of life, with birth and shows important first moments in life - such as a first and last kiss . It was directed by Tom Tagholm, the man behind the 'Meet The Superhumans' film for the Paralympic advertising campaign . He said: 'In the same way as the Paralympics, it would be great to get people thinking about dying in a different, more optimistic way. 'The Paralympics were saying: ‘Here are athletes at the height of their game. This event is about intense competition and dynamism, and there is not even a smidgin of pity’,' he said. 'Similarly with Marie Curie, it is putting death into a different context, the context of life. 'It is showing that there is tremendous value in the last moments, and that attention to small things such as the music you want, or the position of a bed by the window, that these things matter in helping you exit the planet in a way you choose to.' Marie Curie nurses provide free care to people with a terminal illness and support for their families and loved ones.

The short film - which uses actors - is believed to have cost just under £1million and will screen for this first time tonight during a break in ITV's Emmerdale . The Great Daffodil Appeal is Marie Curie’s biggest fundraising campaign and money raised helps the terminally ill to spend their final weeks, days or hours with the people and things they love close by. The charity said it hopes the advert will encourage everyone to give a donation and wear one of the charity’s daffodil pins during March.

'We’ve already had a record number of people signing up to collect for the Great Daffodil Appeal. 'Now it is time to really engage the public through Tom’s film with a message about the importance of delivering great end of life care. It’s an issue that’s relevant to everyone and they can show their support by donating and wearing a daffodil pin.'

In his opening statement, defense lawyer Kevin Canfield argued that Kenny mentally 'snapped' over his wife's infidelities, and should be convicted only of manslaughter. Mr Canfield said the husband lost his mind after his wife sent a topless photo of herself to his cell phone. Kenny later admitted that the intended recipient had been her ex-husband in Trinidad, the lawyer told jurors. Kevin Michael Canfield, asked jurors to convict him only on manslaughter because of Kenny's 'paranoid mind', adding: 'Out of his mind, he had no control at that point in time because of what happened. I’m not saying it’s an excuse. No one deserved to die.' On trial: Kenny appeared in court in Manhatten, New York . Kenny's defense lawyer Kevin Canfield said his client mentally 'snapped' over his wife's infidelities . But prosecutor Linda Ford told jurors in her opening statement that the husband came to the salon prepared for revenge. She said he brought a six-inch kitchen knife and rifled through the cash register before fleeing. The court heard Kenny has a long history of robberies, violence, and drug issues, the New York Post reported. The trial continues.","Michael Kenny, 42, accused of killing his wife in salon in New York .

Japan's prime minister today quoted former British leader Margaret Thatcher over the importance of sea power as tensions with China mounted over a set of tiny islands. Shinzo Abe used the former Prime Minister's defiant words on the 1982 Falklands war with Argentina . to stress the importance of the rule of law at sea. Mr Abe, whose country is embroiled in a row with China over the disputed territory, said: 'Our national interests have been immutable. Defiant: Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (left) used the words of Margaret Thatcher (right) to tell parliament the importance of sea power . The hawkish Mr Abe reiterated in his speech that the islands are Japanese territory . 'They lie in making the seas, which are the foundation of our nation's existence, completely open, free and peaceful.' In a wide-ranging policy speech to parliament he also urged Japan to seek to become 'No.1' as an economic power. Mr Abe went on to quote a remark from Thatcher's memoirs, reflecting on the Falklands war, in which she said Britain was defending the fundamental principle that international law should prevail over the use of force. The war over the remote South Atlantic archipelago began when Argentine troops landed on the Falkland islands on April 2, 1982. It ended 74 days later with their surrender. The conflict killed about 650 Argentine and 255 British troops. Continuing in his own words, Mr Abe said: 'The rule of law at sea. I want to appeal to international society that in modern times changes to the status quo by the use of force will justify nothing.' Former British PM Margaret Thatcher in a Harrier under construction in 1982 . The Union flag flies over Port Howard, West Falkland, after the island was liberated . Tokyo's ties with Beijing chilled sharply after the Japanese government last September bought the rocky islands in the East China Sea, which are controlled by Japan but also claimed by China, from a private owner, sparking violent protests in China. A flare-up in tensions in the territorial row has raised fears of an unintended military incident near the islands, known as the Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China. The United States says the islets fall under a U.S.-Japan security pact, but Washington is keen to avoid a clash in the economically vital region. Japanese fighter jets scrambled again on Thursday after a Chinese twin-engine turboprop Y-12 aircraft came within about 62 miles of what Tokyo considers its airspace over the islands, the defence ministry said. Three Chinese patrol ships briefly entered the disputed waters, the Japan Coast Guard said. The hawkish Mr Abe, who took office in December after his conservative party's big election win, reiterated in his speech that the islands are Japanese territory, and urged Beijing not to escalate tensions. He added, however, that Sino-Japanese relations were vital for Japan and said his door was always open to dialogue. China hit back, saying Beijing did not want to see a maritime incident but accused Japanese leaders of making provocative remarks 'from time to time' and playing up the China threat to provoke a military confrontation. 'At the moment, Japan should regulate its own words and deeds, stop issuing erroneous statements, properly handle the Diaoyu islands and other issues, and take practical measures to create conditions for the improvement of bilateral relations,' Chinese Defence Ministry spokesman Geng Yansheng told a news conference. Abe stressed the importance of the U.S.-Japan security alliance days after his summit with President Barack Obama. Calling the U.S. alliance the axis of Japan's diplomacy and security policies, Mr Abe said: 'It is only logical that, in the open oceans, the United States, which is the world's largest marine state, and Japan, Asia's largest maritime democracy, form a partnership, and to fortify this constantly is necessary.'","Shinzo Abe used former PM's defiant words on 1982 war with Argentina .

The number of women in positions of power in the UK has plummeted causing a damaging effects on our country's social, cultural and political life, an influential new report has claimed today. Researchers found female representation at senior levels of the judiciary, education, the arts, finance, the civil service and Government has gone into reverse. The evidence is presented in a report by Counting Women . In, a coalition of five organisations including the Fawcett Society and . the Hansard Society. Home Secretary Theresa May is one of a dwindling number of women in top jobs, according to a new report . In politics, the report finds that Britain has rapidly fallen down the international league tables for female democratic representation since Gordon Brown left power. The former Labour Prime Minister had eight female cabinet ministers and there were 31 women in government. Women now make up only 22.5 per cent of MPs; 12.3 per cent of council leaders (in England); and 17.4 per cent of the cabinet, the report says. The study found Britain fell 37 places through the noughties, from 33rd place in 2001, to joint 60th in 2010. In western governments, only Ireland and Italy had fewer female representatives in 2010. The Sex and Power 2013: Who Runs Britain? report, to be published tomorrow, found a similar trend at senior levels in the judiciary, education, the arts, finance, the civil service, the City and media. The group was created after the 2010 general election to create annual reports modelled on the audits of public life that were published by the now defunct Equal Opportunities Commission. Women are increasingly under-represented in the judiciary, according to Counting Women In . Nan Sloane, director of the Centre . for Women and Democracy said: 'This report shows a shocking absence of . women from powerful roles in Britain. 'We are often told that it's just a . matter of time before we have equality, but we have already waited for . generations; asking us to wait still more will change nothing, and the . quality of decision-making in our democracy and public life will suffer . as a result. 'There needs to be meaningful action now if next year's report is to show real progress.' Only a third of public appointments are female, as are 15.6 per cent of high court judges and five per cent of editors of national daily newspapers. In many areas, progress has shifted into reverse, such as in the devolved regional political bodies, where fewer women have been returned at recent elections. Katie Ghose, chief executive of the . Electoral Reform Society said: 'These missing women offer the most vivid . illustration of parliament's failure to keep up with the times. While women are well represented in the teaching profession, the report says they are not at the upper echelons of the education sector . 'Politicians will struggle to connect . with voters as long as the combined talents and perspectives of half . the population are shut out. Party leaders admit there's a problem, but . all have failed to find a lasting solution. 'It's not a good look for the Mother . of all Parliaments to be left lagging behind on the fundamental issue of . women's representation.' In Wales, the percentage of women elected has dropped from 50 per cent in 2004 to 40 per cent last year; in Scotland, the figure has dropped from 39.5 per cent to 34.9 per cent in the same time. In a handful of other areas, progress has been made in the past decade, but with a long way still to go. Women now lead three in ten trade unions and membership is 50-50. Ceri Goddard, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said: 'It's simply scandalous fact that in 2013 men still outnumber women four to one in parliament. If political parties don't take urgent action, Britain will continue to fall down the global league table when it comes to women's access to power and representation in politics. 'The number of women in the Cabinet is at a ten year low. Failure to increase the number of women around the top table of politics sends a message to other walks of life and to the next generation for whom we hope for something different, that excluding women from positions of power is acceptable. 'Women's votes will determine the next election – remaining male dominated won't help the parties on polling day' Ruth Fox, chief executive of the Hansard Society said: 'Parliament needs to show leadership in reflecting the people it governs and serves. 'Decisions made in Parliament affect women and men equally and the dearth of women in positions of political power not only reflects badly on the quality of our democracy, it also wastes the skill, expertise and life experience of half the population and sets a terrible example for other professions and industries. 'It's time for Parliament and political parties to take concrete steps to increase the number of women in politics.' Alex Runswick, deputy director of Unlock Democracy, said: 'The lack of female involvement in UK politics is a canary in the mining shaft; it is a particularly visible example of how the system fails to represent people more widely. 'Our democracy and public life is weaker because it misses the skills  experience and talents of over half the population. It is not enough to recognise the problem and simply hope that things will improve; we need Parliament and politicians to take urgent action.'","Evidence presented in report by researchers from Counting Women .

Best of both worlds: The two foot-long creature, known as Coniophis, was a 'transitional snake' with a lizard's head and snake's body . A prehistoric reptile, half snake and half lizard, which lived 70 million years ago, has been unveiled by scientists. The two foot-long creature, known as Coniophis, was a ‘transitional snake’ with a snake’s body and a lizard’s head. New analysis of its fossilized remains shows snakes evolved their modern skulls on land - reigniting a long running dispute over whether they are marine or terrestrial animals. It was discovered over a century ago embedded in rocks in mountainous Wyoming in the west of the US but palaeontologists took another look at long neglected remains to get new clues to how it looked and lived. Dr Nick Longrich, of Yale University in Connecticut, said: ‘The snake would have been about two feet long - so it was fairly small. It was non-venomous - venomous snakes evolved after the dinosaurs went extinct. ‘But it’s possible it constricted its prey like many primitive snakes do today. ‘Coniophis lived alongside a number of familiar dinosaurs - it would have slithered beneath the feet of animals like T. rex and Triceratops. ‘However it probably wasn’t hunted by dinosaurs. It was a burrower and so it would have spent much of its time hidden.’ The researchers said the lizard-like head suggests early snakes were burrowers that had long bodies before evolving the highly flexible skull characteristic of modern snakes. Dr Longrich said: ‘Snakes are the most diverse group of lizards, but their origins and early evolution remain poorly understood owing to a lack of transitional forms. ‘Several major issues remain outstanding, such as whether snakes originated in a marine or terrestrial environment and how their unique feeding mechanism evolved.’ Coniophis emerged from a period known geologically as the Late Cretaceous and was among the first snakes discovered. But until now only an isolated vertebra has been described and it has been overlooked in discussions of snake evolution. The researchers, whose findings are published in Nature, looked at previously undescribed material from the ancient snake including two upper jaw bones known as the maxilla and the lower jawbone where the teeth formed, along with some additional vertebrae. Dr Longrich said: ‘Coniophis occurs in a continental floodplain environment, consistent with a terrestrial rather than a marine origin; furthermore, its small size and reduced neural spines indicate fossorial habits, suggesting that snakes evolved from burrowing lizards. ‘The skull is intermediate between that of lizards and snakes.’ Something underfoot? Coniophis lived alongside a number of familiar dinosaurs - it would have slithered beneath the feet of animals like T. rex and Triceratops . The researchers also provided insight into the evolution of snake feeding. Considering its small size, hooked teeth and skull structure - unlike modern snakes, Coniophis lacks the ability to swallow large prey whole - they propose it fed on relatively large, soft-bodied prey. The upper jaw was firmly united with the skull, indicating a motionless snout. Dr Longrich said: ‘Coniophis therefore represents a transitional snake, combining a snake-like body and a lizard-like head.’ Evolution of a new method of locomotion, and adaptations that facilitate the ingestion of larger prey were probably a key evolutionary step that promoted the diversification of snakes, added the researchers.","Find offers hints of how modern snakes evolved .

Berlin's state government decided to stop private broadcaster RTL from filming a copy of the show in the city-owned Vivantes hospital. Scroll down for video .

At least 30 had been set up in the capital's Friedrichshain hospital to film mothers-to-be, their families and even their births, as well as staff. It promised that the end result would give 'authentic glimpses in the world of real feelings'. Those mothers who signed up to take part in the show would have their babies in separate areas of the hospital and be filmed.

'Even . if the mothers and their families have given their consent to the . filming, the child will likely be confronted with the footage later in . life,' said Mario Czaja, Berlin state health minister. RTL said yesterday it was surprised by the decision, and that all legal questions had been worked out well in advance between the producers and the hospital. One Born Every Minute is in its fourth series in the UK, which is filmed on two busy labour wards in Leeds: Leeds General Infirmary and St. James's Hospital. The series has consistently garnered ratings, attracting more than three million viewers and more than a 12 per cent of the audience share. The first series won a BAFTA in 2010 and was nominated again . in 2011. Versions of it have also been shown in the U.S., France and Sweden.","Fly-on-the-wall show follows staff and patients on busy maternity ward .

It would be wise to keep away from this leopard, because after its latest meal it'll be feeling a bit prickly. The big cat must have been extremely hungry to even think of tackling a porcupine bristling with needle-sharp quills. But the battle commenced and the leopard suffered for its supper. It was speared by the quills in its muzzle, chest, and paws. Prickly: This leopard, pictured at the Kruger National Park in South Africa, tried to make a porcupine his dinner . The battle commenced and the leopard suffered for its supper by being speared by the quills in its muzzle, chest, and paws . In obvious discomfort from the . impalement, according to witnesses, the leopard took time out to try and . swat the quills from its body with its paws. Yet the sheer persistence of the leopard and its need for food drove it to ignore the pain and continue its quest. Eventually, it found a way to pick its way through the quills and subdued the porcupine. The unfortunate prickly beast was dragged off into scrubland at the side of a road. These extraordinary pictures were taken by Sam Jones, 42, an intensive care nurse at a hospital in Carlisle, Cumbia, when she went on a 12-day safari to the Kruger National Park in South Africa. Hungry: Looking for something to eat, the leopard surveys the body of its prey . Persistence: Hungry like the wolf, this leopard ignored the pain and continued its quest to get a bite to eat . Had enough? These extraordinary pictures were taken by Sam Jones, 42, an intensive care nurse at a hospital in Carlisle, Cumbria . Her jeep stopped to allow the party to view the leopard versus food battle on a road between Satara and Skukuza. She said: 'I think the leopard had been chasing the porcupine, which can move quite fast, and it ran out onto the road where the leopard caught it. 'At one point the leopard was pawing at its own face to try and remove the quills. It looked uncomfortable . 'It is just nature in action and that is the way it is. I was very lucky to see something like this out in the open. It is a very unusual sight.' A porcupine's quills are normally off-white and black and are made out of keratin. Up to 30,000 quills cover the average porcupine which can grow up to 30cm long. Because of its natural defence mechanism, porcupines do not have to fear being eaten by very many animals. But unlike this leopard, three animals have figured out how to eat porcupines. Bobcats, cougars and fishers, which are native to north America, have learned that a porcupine has no quills . on its stomach. So one of these predators will sometimes kill and eat a . porcupine by flipping it onto its back and biting into its vulnerable . belly. But few animals know this porcupine-eating trick.Other animals that try to eat them include  lions, hyenas and birds of prey, but they are rarely successful. And, what do porcupines eat? A porcupine eats tender bark and twigs, along with other types of vegetation.","Extraordinary pictures were taken by Sam Jones, 42, from Carlise .

Italian President Giorgio Napolitano cancelled a dinner with Germany's opposition leader today after he claimed the country elected a bunch of 'clowns'. Peer Steinbrueck, a Social Democrat who will take on Chancellor Angela Merkel in Germany's next national election in September, was referring to Italian former premier Silvio Berlusconi and comic-turned-politician Beppe Grillo. Steinbrueck has a reputation for gaffes and his remark created the first diplomatic incident of his accident-prone campaign. Cancelled: President Giorgio Napolitano of Italy (left) was due to meet German chancellor candidate Peer Steinbrueck (right) before it was called off . Steinbrueck said yesterday he was 'appalled that two clowns have won' Italy's election. The vote was actually inconclusive with no party garnering a majority in parliament, although Grillo's anti-establishment party surged dramatically. Napolitano, an 87-year-old former communist with no natural affinity for Berlusconi or Grillo, now faces the difficult task of trying to appoint a coalition government. Italian media said he had expressed concern about 'populism' after the election result in a private meeting during his visit to Germany, but these comments could not be confirmed. As head of state, he may have felt duty-bound to defend the dignity of Italy's political institutions. The German candidate's spokesman said Napolitano cancelled 'because of Steinbrueck's remarks on Tuesday' and added that the SPD politician 'understood Napolitano's domestic political reasons for cancelling'. Napolitano's spokesman was unavailable for comment. Napolitano and Steinbrueck had been scheduled to meet over dinner at a Berlin hotel. Napolitano, who visited Munich on Tuesday and Wednesday, was due to meet Merkel in the German capital on Thursday. A clown? Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi casts his vote in a polling station on February 24 . The leader of the 'Five Stars Movement', Italian comedian Beppe Grillo, was described as one of the 'clowns' Steinbrueck made it absolutely clear in his comments to an SPD rally in Potsdam he was referring to Grillo and Berlusconi, calling the latter 'clearly a clown with a testosterone boost'. 'My impression is that two populists won,' he said. Berlusconi, a scandal-ridden billionaire media mogul, is very unpopular in Germany and slated often in the media. But Steinbrueck did himself no favours with his frank talk. German politicians are expected to strike a serious tone and refrain from interfering in the internal affairs of European partners. On Twitter, some commentators dismissed the acerbic Steinbrueck as the 'real clown'. 'Steinbrueck behaves like a bull in a china shop,' said Michael Meister, deputy leader of Merkel's conservatives in the Bundestag (lower house of parliament). Election rivals: Peer Steinbrueck and Chancellor Angela Merkel will go to the polls later this year . He accused Steinbrueck of damaging Germany's reputation abroad with such comments. Some SPD politicians also criticised Steinbrueck for his utterance. Italy's elections, which threaten to tip the euro zone back into crisis, showed a big swell in support for Grillo's 5-Star Movement and a surprisingly strong result for Berlusconi. He had been expected to lose heavily to the centre left, which won the lower house but not the Senate. Both Grillo and Berlusconi campaigned against the austerity measures implemented by technocrat Prime Minister Mario Monti at the urging of Germany's conservative chancellor Merkel. Grillo, in his popular blog, laid into Merkel for imposing German-style fiscal austerity on Italy. Berlusconi has made more personal attacks on Merkel, whom he blames for his fall from power in 2011 because of her hesitancy on bailouts. Berlusconi, who has been sentenced for tax fraud and is on trial accused of having sex with an under-aged prostitute, is reported to have made rude remarks about Merkel's appearance in a phone call wiretapped by investigators, though he denies this. Merkel is more diplomatic than the acerbic Steinbrueck, a former German finance minister whose campaign for the election in September has got off to a poor start. Merkel's parliamentary allies and even cabinet ministers had voiced concern about the possibility of a Berlusconi comeback before Sunday and Monday's elections but the chancellor kept any reservations to herself. Steinbrueck made waves with undiplomatic statements when he served as finance minister under Merkel between 2005 and 2009, for example referring to the Swiss as Indians running scared from the cavalry during a crackdown he led on tax havens.","Italian President Giorgio Napolitano cancels dinner with Peer Steinbrueck .

'Personally I have been very disappointed with some of the changes that have taken place at very short notice. 'I resign from the board today and will be giving three months’ notice.' Dr Hulme, who joined the board five months ago, said: 'I have been absolutely marginalised and made to feel irrelevant ever since.' This comes after it was announced that Mid-Staffordshire may be the first foundation trust to be put into administration. Monitor, the watchdog that regulates trusts, said it was considering the move in order to 'safeguard services' for local patients . South London Healthcare NHS Trust (SLHT) became the first ever NHS trust to be put into administration last year after it started losing around £1.3 million a week. Now Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust could be the first foundation trust - the flagship trusts of the NHS - to face the same fate.

A public inquiry into the trust said that patients had experienced 'appalling' care between 2005 and 2009. It said that the trust had cared more about cost control than the quality and safety of the care it gave.

Jailed: Middle class robber Diallo Allen who burgled a house just three days after being spared jail for carrying out three muggings has now been sent to prison . A middle class robber who burgled a house just three days after being spared jail for carrying out three muggings has now been sent to prison. Diallo Allen was allowed to walk free by Judge Lesley Newton despite carrying out three muggings after she heard he turned to crime when his family fell on hard times. The judge instead gave Allen a 15 month sentence suspended for two years. But just three days later he smashed his way into a house in Chorlton, Manchester. Police found traces of 18-year-old Allen's blood at the scene.  Today, his suspended sentence was revoked at Manchester Crown Court. Allen, from Chorlton, was sentenced to a further two months in a young offenders institute - meaning he will now be locked up for 17 months. Diallo had previously appeared in court on January 23, where he was sentenced for stealing an iPhone, Blackberry and bag worth £800 from three teenagers in Chorlton. At that hearing, Judge Newton was told he had fallen with a bad crowd when financial difficulties meant his family had to move to the Nell Lane estate, 1.5 miles away, and took pity on him. At his original hearing the court was told how Allen's mother, Deanne Blake, was a social worker who worked for Manchester council for 18 years before launching her own private consultancy. His dad Garfield Allen, who is separated from Ms Blake, was a respected theatre director at the Green Room in Manchester before he was made redundant due to funding cuts in the arts. Det Con Rob Southern said: 'When he was sentenced for the robberies, much was made in the media about his change in personal circumstances. 'It was argued that the offending coincided with him moving to the Nell Lane estate area but that argument is insulting to the residents there. 'Allen and Allen alone took the decision to rob three people and after being given a second chance took a decision to break into a house just a couple of days later.' After the case was reported, . 19-year-old Manchester United reserves goalkeeper Sam Johnstone revealed . one of the victims was his girlfriend Byrony Turner - describing the . sentence as 'a joke'. Johnstone tweeted: ‘What a joke!! The . guy who mugged my gf while I was in China on tour let off. That bag and . purse was expensive!’ From the old: Allen used to live with his parents on the upmarket Stratton Road in Chorlton, Greater Manchester, which has an average price of £210,000, before the recession forced them out . To the new: Financial difficulties meant Allen's family had to move 1.5 miles away to Ploughbank Drive on the Nell Lane estate, which has an average house price of £100,000 . Miss Turner also took to the social . networking site, saying: ‘Ridiculous excuse in my eyes after what he put . me through. These people need to be off the streets.’ Local councillor Norman Lewis condemned the judge’s decision to spare Allen jail, saying that he should have been made to take responsibility for his criminal actions. ‘People’s homes are their own Shangri-Las and it’s unacceptable to come home to find that somebody has been through their property,’ he said. ‘The judge needs to reflect on her decision to suspend the sentence.’ Fury: After the initial case was reported, Manchester United reserves goalkeeper Sam Johnstone tweeted (right) that one of the victims was his girlfriend - calling the sentence a 'joke'.

"By . Tamara Cohen . PUBLISHED: . 08:36 EST, 23 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:18 EST, 23 July 2012 . British scientists have  carried out a series of controversial experiments in which the eyes of kittens were sewn shut. The revelation has sparked a row with animal rights campaigners who called the experiments ‘unacceptably cruel’. The British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV), which opposes all testing on animals, claims the research into a childhood eye condition could have been carried out on humans using different experiments. Experiment: The kittens had their eyelids stitched up (file picture of kitten asleep) as part of trials to find out how the brain responds to sensory deprivation . However, Cardiff University said it was impossible to use any other method and stressed it followed strict Home Office guidelines to  justify the use of cats and ensure minimal suffering. Cats are used in eye research because they have forward-facing eyes like humans, and are born  with poor vision and ‘learn’ to see as their brain cells develop connections with the eye. If this process falters in early childhood it leads to amblyopia, better known as lazy eye, which can lead to loss of vision, crossed eye or blindness in one eye. Deputy Leader of Cardiff Council Ralph Cook said the findings 'can't be transferred to humans in anyway' In the study into eye development, five kittens were raised normally  for a month before having surgery under general anaesthetic to sew  up their eyes for either two or  seven days. Another 11 kittens were raised in total darkness with their mother for between one and 12 weeks and 15 other cats were raised in normal conditions for up to a year. All 31 cats were then anaesthetised and the activity in their brains and eyes was monitored to see how their vision had developed, before they were put down. BUAV chief executive Michelle Thew said: ‘We know the public  will be shocked to learn of  publicly funded experiments at  Cardiff University in which kittens have been subjected to unpleasant procedures such as depriving  them of light or sewing up an eyelid before invasive brain surgery and death.’ BUAV’s veterinary adviser Dr Ned Buyukmihci said: ‘There are established methods of obtaining essentially the same information in a humane way from people.’ But Cardiff University stressed the research was subject to an ethical review by the Home Office’s Science in Animals Regulation Unit. It said developmental eye disorders, such as amblyopia, are incurable beyond childhood and understanding how the brain adapts to signals from the eye would help patients in the long-term. A spokesman said: ‘Cardiff University completely rejects the accusation that this experiment, which was completed in 2010, is cruel or unnecessary. Criticism: The experiment on 31 kittens at Cardiff University (pictured) has been slammed by animal rights groups who have branded it 'cruel' ‘The University will always use alternative technology where it exists and only uses animals when absolutely necessary. ‘While a treatment for older children may be some time away, Cardiff University believes this research raises the prospect of markedly improving the sight of sufferers of this serious condition.’ A spokesman for the Medical Research Council, which part- funded the research from taxpayers’ money, said: ‘Our reviewers judged that this project proposal was worthwhile and of high quality, in the face of very strong competition for funding.’ The same procedure on cats was at the centre of an animal-rights furore in the 1980s in which activists attacked Professor Colin Blakemore, of Oxford University, who was researching childhood blindness.","The aim was to subject 31 cats to sensory deprivation to see how the brain reacts .

A serial sex attacker who warned authorities of his desire to imprison, rape and kill a woman fulfilled his sick fantasy when he murdered his girlfriend’s housemate and then dismembered her body. Clive Sharp, 46, had a history of violence against women stretching back more than 30 years. He had been jailed three times for vile sexual offences, starting when he was just 17 and raped a girl of 15. Sentenced: Clive Sharp, left, will spend at least 37 years in prison for the killing of Catherine Gowing, right . And while attending a treatment . programme for sex offenders in the 1990s he even revealed that he . fantasised about tying up a woman and then raping and murdering her. But despite the authorities knowing he . posed a danger to women, he was repeatedly released back into the . community – and repeatedly went on to reoffend. Years after revealing his twisted . fantasy, he made it a horrifying reality when he broke into the home of . veterinary surgeon Catherine Gowing, 37, in October and subjected her to . a four-hour ordeal of rape and sexual abuse. He then killed her, dismembered her body and dumped parts wrapped in bin liners in locations around North Wales. Specially trained police officers and . underwater divers spent nearly three weeks searching for her before the . first human remains were uncovered in a shallow pond. Criminal: Sharp being taken away from Mold Crown Court to begin his prison sentence . Days later more body parts were found . but, despite the largest search in North Wales police history, the force . has been unable to recover all of Miss Gowing’s remains. Yesterday Sharp, who pleaded guilty to her murder at an earlier hearing, was sentenced to a minimum of 37 years behind bars. The court heard that at the age of 16, . he had been given a supervision order for making indecent phone calls . and sending indecent letters to women. A year later he was jailed for three years for the rape of a 15-year-old girl after holding a piece of glass to her neck. Eleven years later, in 1994, Sharp was . jailed for three  years for a sex attack on a friend’s wife. And within . months of his release, he was jailed for eight years for false . imprisonment after tying up a woman and threatening her with a knife. Mold Crown Court heard that while . attending a sex offenders’ treatment programme in the 1990s he revealed . he had ‘a long-standing fantasy of imprisoning, raping and murdering a . woman’. Emotional: Emma Maguire, right, the victim's sister, paid tribute to her outside Mold Crown Court yesterday . Just hours before Miss Gowing’s . murder, he left another woman tied to a bed after she refused to take . part in perverted sexual acts, the court heard. Passing sentence, the . judge told Sharp: ‘This is a horrific, cold-hearted murder, carried out . to gratify your perverted sexual desires.’ Following the hearing, the family of . the Irish-born vet said she would always remain a ‘shining light’. Her . sister Emma added: ‘This man has caused my family unimaginable . suffering, pain and grief and the recurring nightmare of what he did to . Catherine before she died. ‘Our parents are heartbroken. They miss her smiley face, her kindness, her compassion and the energy she exuded. ‘She was a vibrant, wonderful woman . who lived life to the full with compassion, fun, adventure and joy. Our . lives will never be the same again.’ Car: The victim's burnt-out vehicle was found during the wide-ranging search for her remains . Horror: Police searching for Miss Gowing's body in North Wales last October . After the murder, Miss Gowing’s mother . Maureen said: ‘My worst nightmare was my beautiful daughter curled up . somewhere with no escape. She’s gone to a better place. Gone from an . evil world.’ The court heard Miss Gowing had moved to North Wales from her native County Offaly in the Republic of Ireland to work as a vet. She shared a house with a friend, Jane Doyle, who was in a relationship with Sharp and he was a frequent visitor to their home. On the weekend of the attack, Miss Doyle had gone to visit family and friends in Ireland and Miss Gowing was alone. Sharp had been to see another woman . for sex and had tied her up, but when  she refused some of his  sexual . demands he had left  her tied up and driven to  Miss Gowing’s house. CCTV: Miss Gowing was caught on camera in a local supermarket shortly before being killed by Sharp . Driving away: The Irish vet was seen in her car but went missing shortly afterwards, sparking a search operation . Andrew Thomas QC, prosecuting, told . the court Sharp had a history of similar sexual offences in which he . indulged his fantasy of tying up, gagging and assaulting women. He said: ‘The fantasy was that he . would tie up his victim and have sex with her as long as he wanted. The . victim would then be dead – either strangled or drowned. ‘This was a sexually-motivated murder.

A massive security operation – one of . the biggest seen at a court case in the UK – has been mounted . surrounding a court case into the death of two female PCs. It involves up to 150 officers, many of them armed, with marksmen on the rooftops of surrounding buildings as a court hears the case of Dale Cregan, charged with four murders and four charges of attempted murder. The armed officers bristled with . equipment, including the state-of-the-art Heckler & Koch G36C . assault rifle, capable of firing 600 rounds per minute and boasting an . effective range of almost 800 metres. Equipped: Officers are carrying assault rifles, pistols, CS gas and wearing the latest body armour for protection . Many . were also armed with the Austrian-made Glock handgun, which holds 17 . bullets and is noted for its reliability and accuracy. It was recently . adopted as the sidearm of the UK's armed forces. As . well as firearms, they are equipped with crippling CS gas spray, Kevlar . body armour, helmets and goggles, extra ammo as well as handcuffs and . communications equipment. A killer ambushed two female police officers and sprayed them with bullets – stopping only when he ran out of ammunition, a court heard yesterday. Trial: Dale Cregan (left in police mugshot, right in court today) had evaded a national manhunt when he set a trap, Preston Crown Court heard . After shooting them with a Glock pistol, one-eyed Dale Cregan, 29, threw a grenade at the unarmed WPCs as they lay near each other, it was alleged. Cregan had called police with reports of a fictitious burglary and PC Fiona Bone, 32 and PC Nicola Hughes, 23, were sent to investigate, the jury heard. Yesterday Cregan, who wears a black false onyx eye, appeared in court charged with four murders and four charges of attempted murder. He and nine other defendants appeared in a dock packed with security staff for the start of the trial at Preston Crown Court. The parents of both officers – Susan and Bryn Hughes and Paul and June Bone – sat in court stern-faced as the case was opened against Cregan. The jury was told a wave of violence . that erupted on the streets of Manchester last year was triggered by a . row between two families. Nicholas . Clarke, prosecuting, said: ‘The Short family had been involved over a . number of years in a long-standing feud with members of another local . family, the Atkinsons. 'The families had reached a state of uneasy peace . following a lengthy dispute.’ But the court heard that peace was . shattered when an argument flared between Raymond Young, a member of the . Short family, and Theresa Atkinson, the matriarch of her family. Atkinson allegedly lashed out with a bottle, hitting Young, who . retaliated by ‘back-handing’ her. She responded by shouting: ‘I’m going . to get you done by my sons. You just wait here, you’re dead.’ Scroll down for videos . Deaths: Cregan is accused of killing PCs Fiona Bone (left), 32, and Nicola Hughes (right), 23, and in a gun and grenade attack on September 18 last year . Accused: Cregan sat in the dock flanked by security staff at Preston Crown Court . Days later, Atkinson’s son, Leon, 35, recruited Cregan to attack the . Short family, the court heard. As well as Cregan, others including . Anthony Wilkinson, 33, Luke Livesey, 27, Damian Gorman, 38, Matthew . James, 33 and Ryan Hadfield, 28, were brought in. The jury heard that in May last year the Short family and friends had . gone for an evening out and ended up at the Cotton Tree pub in . Droylsden, Manchester. Mr Clarke QC said last orders had been called and the landlord was . tidying up when the door opened and a man wearing a balaclava stepped . in. ‘The gunman took a single step into the pub and lifted his right . arm,’ Mr Clarke said. ‘In his outstretched hand was a gun. The gun was . fired.’ Drinkers in the pub saw Mark Short fall to the floor and three . more men – John Collins, Michael Belcher and Ryan Pridding – were also . hit. David Short, 46, had gone to the toilet at the time of the shooting and . returned to find his son fatally wounded on the pub floor. Mark Short, . 23, died in his father’s arms.

Mr Clarke said: ‘David Short was . . . chased through his house, being shot as he ran. ‘He was murdered in a hail of gunfire from two weapons carried by Cregan and Wilkinson.’ He added: ‘David Short had been shot at least nine times to his head and . body. He was chased from his kitchen, into his conservatory and . outside. ‘He eventually fell in an alleyway at the side of his house. A grenade was then thrown on to him, causing massive injuries.’ Protection: An armed police officer stands guard outside Preston Crown Court ahead of Dale Cregan's arrival .

A leading academic has called for a wider inquiry into sexual abuse at music schools in the UK after a choirmaster and his ex-wife were convicted of abusing a former pupil. Michael Brewer and his former wife Kay, both 68, were convicted of six counts of indecent assault. Their victim, Frances Andrade, 48, a former pupil at Chetham’s School of Music in Manchester, killed herself with an overdose shortly after testifying against the pair. Last night, an academic who was also a pupil at Chetham’s around the same time as Mrs Andrade, called for a wider inquiry into sexual abuse at music schools in the Seventies and Eighties. Frances Andrade was abused by choirmaster Michael Brewer at Chetham's music school. Now academic Ian Pace says a wider investigation into music schools must take place . Ian Pace, a pianist and musicologist who lectures at City University in London, said the world of classical music was controlled by just a few influential people. He said: ‘It is well known within the music world that there are many other such stories involving a variety of individuals in positions of power at various music schools. ‘Many of these people are extremely afraid to come forward with their stories, in a close-knit world of classical music in which careers are dependent upon the whims of a few powerful individuals. ‘A full independent inquiry into sexual and physical abuse in classical music education during this time is now absolutely paramount.’ Guilty: Michael Brewer was found guilty of indecently assaulting Frances after she won a place the music school where he was choirmaster. His ex-wife Hillary Brewer joined in with the abuse after Frances turned 18 . Greater Manchester Police says it wants to hear from anyone who may have fallen victim to sexual abuse at the music school. It has also defended its care of Frances Andrade during the trial at Manchester Crown Court. The trial heard sexual abuse was ‘rife’ at elite music academy Chetham’s. Mrs Andrade told the court: ‘It was normal for us. Several friends of mine had been raped.’ Mr Brewer was director of music at Chetham’s when he began abusing his victim, then 14, in 1978. Mrs Andrade was found dead at her Surrey home after giving evidence against the Brewers. Jurors were not told about her death until after they found the pair guilty of six counts of sexual assault. Brewer and his ex-wife were remanded in custody and will be sentenced at a later date.","He urges an investigation into music schools in the Seventies and Eighties .

Police mounted one of the largest security operations ever for a  UK court case yesterday as Dale Cregan appeared in the dock accused of shooting dead two policewomen. He is alleged to have killed PCs Nicola Hughes, 23, and Fiona  Bone, 32, in a gun and grenade attack in Hattersley, near Manchester, last September. Up to 150 officers, many wearing black paramilitary-style clothing and body armour and clutching sub-machine guns, swamped the streets near Preston Crown Court in a lockdown security operation. Marksmen covered the area from the top of the court and a neighbouring building, while a helicopter hovered above. Cregan, along with other defendants, is also accused of murdering Mark Short, 23, in a shooting at a pub in May and then killing his father David Short, 46, at his home in August.

When she discovered she was pregnant . the student killed herself after sending the same text to both her . estranged husband and lover, which simply said: ‘I am going to die, . sorry.’ Tragedy: Special police constable Tammy Paterson (left), 24, was torn between husband Ian Paterson, 28, and John Lewis (right), 36, the tutor she fell for after enrolling at Deeside College in Flintshire, North Wales . Mrs Paterson, who had just qualified as a special constable, was found hanged in her police issue trousers, blouse and hat in a bedroom at her home. At an inquest into her death, coroner John Gittins said it was a tragic waste of a young life and described her suicide as a ‘very, very sad case’. The hearing was told Lithuanian-born Tatjana Vitaite – known as Tammy – had moved to the UK some years ago and began working in a factory in North Wales. Wedding day: Tammy Paterson (left) had told her husband Ian Paterson (right) she was pregnant by Mr Lewis . She met fellow worker Ian Paterson at . the factory and romance blossomed between them.

Mr Paterson, 28, of Sandycroft, North . Wales told the inquest he and his wife split up in May last year though . they tried for a reconciliation before finally separating. 'I am going to die, sorry' Tammy Paterson's text to husband Ian Paterson and lover John Lewis . ‘She said we should have a break from . each other,’ he explained. But he added the reconciliation did not work . out and he finally moved out of their home for good. Mr Lewis told the inquest: ‘I was . aware she was married with a child. She confided in me about her . problems. She felt she could trust me. I was aware that she was having . problems in her marriage. ‘I believed she left her husband. She . asked me if things were different, would I date her?’ He said he told . her he couldn’t because they were teacher and student. But the inquest at North East Wales . Coroner’s Court in Mold heard the pair later started an affair after . their ‘relationship changed’. Family: Mrs Paterson (right) had left notes for her daughter Abigail (centre), three, and her husband Ian (left) Mr Lewis told the hearing: ‘Things . happened which should not have’ and claimed both of them were extremely . vulnerable at the time. The lecturer said the relationship . only grew in the last weeks of her college course and claimed he loved . her and he wanted to be with her. 'Things happened which should not have - we were both vulnerable at the time' John Lewis, lover . Within weeks of finishing the public . services course she told him she was pregnant and claimed she wanted the . baby and also wanted to have a future with him. But she then changed . her mind and said she wanted an abortion and intended to continue with . her career. Mr Lewis said he supported her in her decision. ‘We were . hoping for a future together,’ he said.

Child killer Jon Venables tried to seduce a mother-of-one over the internet by sending her flattering messages, she has revealed. Sarah Finn, 36, unknowingly exchanged dozens of online messages and texts with James Bulger’s killer. They would chat about rock music, festivals and partying and Venables confessed he loved the Pirates of the Caribbean films and the rock band, Muse. He sent flattering messages and texts to her and tried to persuade her to meet up with him but Miss Finn, who has a 10-year-old son, never accepted his invitations. Scroll down for video . Groomer: Jon Venables, pictured aged ten at the 1993 arrest, befriended single mother Sarah Finn online and spent nearly a year trying to seduce her and convince her to meet him . Eventually their internet relationship collapsed after Venables sent her a photograph of his genitals. Miss Finn said she was astonished and shocked when she was told she had been in communication with a child killer. She said: ‘It’s chilling to think our relationship could have gone further and I may possibly have introduced him to my son who was ten - the same age he was when he killed James. ‘I had moved to a new area and was looking for friendship and possibly love. He nearly became mine, and that terrified me.’ Venables and his friend Robert Thompson were only ten when they abducted, tortured and murdered two-year-old James Bulger in Bootle, Merseyside in 1993. 'Charming': Sarah Finn describes Venables as 'kind' and 'easy to talk to' (file photo) They were released in 2001 and were both given a new identities. They are protected by an injunction granting them lifelong anonymity for fear of revenge attacks. Miss Finn, who had recently moved to North England with her son, formed the internet relationship with Venables after she accepted his friend request on MySpace in March 2007. The mother-of-one described him as ‘good looking, charming, kind and easy to talk to.’ She found that they shared a love for rock music, festivals and partying and began chatting regularly on MSN Messenger. They became friends on Facebook, swapped phone numbers and would occasionally chat using a webcam. Miss Finn admitted she enjoyed their messaging and that they would have intimate conversations and text each other ‘quite a lot’. She said he would often compliment her appearance and they would talk about going on nights out together. She says Venables, now 30, kept asking to meet up with her but he suggested areas she was unfamiliar with, which deterred her from going. She said: ‘He seemed like a sound guy. I remember him telling me he loved the film Pirates of the Caribbean. ‘He would say he was ‘sad’ because he was such a fan of Muse he’d seen them about ten times. ‘He flattered me a lot and said I was pretty. We talked about going on nights out together. ‘We got to know each other and talked intimately. And he would text quite a lot. Sometimes he would be flirty — sometimes not.’ But she admitted there were a few alarm bells and Venables appeared to be saying things which weren’t believable. Recalling a night in May 2007 when the pair spoke via webcam, she said ‘He looked off his face on drink or drugs. He didn’t look normal. Then he fell asleep.’ Miss Finn eased off on their online relationship after Venables’ messages became increasingly sexual, culminating in him sending her a photograph of his penis.

Child killer: The last image of James Bulger shows him holding the hand of Jon Venables as they leave a shopping centre in Bootle, Merseyside . In 2008 his messages stopped completely and his Facebook profile and MySpace snaps were deleted. In 2010 it emerged that Venables was back behind bars for breaking conditions of his release with offences involving more than 100 sex abuse photos, some of children as young as two. Miss Finn discovered her admirer was the infamous child killer when a woman linked to a true crime enthusiast contacted her - assuming she knew who he was. She said: ‘I was horrified I’d got so close to him. It’s terrifying to think you could be dating a murderer I still dread to think what might have happened if I had met him.’ An image, uploaded to Twitter, last month allegedly showed Jon Venables at a birthday party after his 2001 release with a new identity. The picture purporting to be of Venables was re-tweeted by more than 100 users and although it was swiftly taken down, it may have been viewed by thousands. Venables has served his child pornography sentence and a parole hearing is scheduled to take place within the next couple of months. James Bulger’s father, Ralph, said: ‘Venables always was and remains a very sick and manipulative individual. This is a perfect example of how dangerous he still is. Thank God this woman and her child had a lucky escape.’ Last month was the 20th anniversary of the death of toddler James Bulger.

Delegates stayed overnight used the sports facilities and tucked into two buffet lunches and dinner, at £145 a head . The hotel offers massages but none were paid for by taxpayers' money. A member of the public asked: 'Is this good use of public money, when most of them live within easy travelling distance and NHS staff are being made redundant?' Su Long, designate chief officer of . Bolton’s CCG, said she looked at the alternatives, but the Marriott was . ‘the best value offer’. But she added the CCG, which is a new body set up to replace the Primary . Care Trust, would be reviewing the choice to make sure it was the best . use of resources. An outgoing chief constable was treated to a lavish leaving party costing the taxpayer more than £4,000 it has been revealed. A Freedom of Information request revealed that Avon and Somerset Police spent £4,090 on a leaving party for Colin Port at the plush Bristol Zoo Pavilion last month. The bash, at the end of January was attended by fellow chief constables, former Police Authority members, community leaders, local dignitaries and members of the press and the BBC. Guests were treated to wine and a gourmet finger buffet including an array of luxury sandwiches, chicken satay, fish goujons, sausages and bruschetta. The evening was arranged to say thank you to Mr Port who took the helm of Avon and Somerset police in 2005. Under his leadership recorded crime in Bristol fell by a third and detection rates shot up the national league tables. But when Sue Mountstevens was elected Police and Crime Commissioner and Mr Port found out he would have to apply again for his job he decided to step down. Miss Long said: ‘We take very seriously someone who is concerned we would waste taxpayers’ money, we really consider what we spend our money on. ‘I have felt on reflection it has been a really good use of time and resources, but obviously we always need to look at it and reflect whether it has been a good use of money and whether we should do it again.’ Miss Long said it would have taken the staff ‘two months of normal meetings to get through the amount of work’ they completed at the hotel, because it allowed them to work ‘rapidly and intensively’. Members of the CCG’s board and leadership team and 17 GPs, who are clinical leads, gathered at the hotel at 1pm on Thursday, January 31, and left at 1.30pm the next day. They worked until their evening meal, which was included in the package, socialised during the evening, stayed over and continued to work the next day. Drinks and other refreshments were paid for by individuals, though some chose not to stay overnight. She added: ‘We are a new team and organisation and it is the sort of day that we think is useful for planning the start of the year.’ The CCG discussed how to make efficiencies of £18million, with £12million saving to be made now and an additional £6million for future years. She said government cuts to CCGs meant they needed to find savings so they could continue to provide new services. Matthew Sinclair of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘It beggars belief that NHS executives think it’s appropriate to plan an away day at an expensive four-star hotel, particularly when much of their discussion should be focusing on saving money and trimming fat from budgets. ‘It demonstrates that the public sector top brass is completely out of touch with the hard-working families who have to foot the bill for luxurious overnight stays like this. NHS bosses owe it to taxpayers and patients to hold these meetings for as little cost as possible.’","28 delegates enjoyed four-star luxury of the Marriott Hotel, in Worsley .

Thousands of badgers will be culled this summer in a bid to limit the spread of tuberculosis in cattle. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said yesterday that two pilot schemes can go ahead from June after final licence conditions are met. He said bovine TB was the ‘biggest challenge’ facing livestock in Britain. A six-week cull will see marksmen shoot 70 per cent of badgers in West Gloucestershire and West Somerset, with up to 5,100 to be killed this year. Up to 70 per cent of badgers will be culled in the pilot areas in a bid to curb the spread of tuberculous in cattle herds . Thousands more could be culled in the . next three years in an effort to keep numbers below 30 per cent of . their current population. A third area, in Dorset, is also being lined up for a possible cull. Mr Paterson told the National . Farmers’ Union conference in Birmingham the disease had cost taxpayers . £500million in the past decade, including compensation to farmers for . losses. Costs could reach £1billion over the next decade if the disease is left unchecked, he added. But campaigners, including Queen guitarist Brian May, have argued the cull will not stop the spread of the disease. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said he was determined to avoid any further delays to the cull . The licences for the pilot schemes will allow culling to take place annually over a six-week period for four years. Up to 5,000 badgers will be killed across the two areas. Mr Paterson said: ‘Bovine TB is spreading at an alarming rate and causing real devastation to our beef and dairy industry. ‘I am determined that there are no further delays this year. That is why we have taken the sensible step with the farming industry to elect a reserve area that can be called upon should anything happen to prevent culling in Somerset or Gloucester. ‘These pilot culls are just one part of our approach to control and eradicate this dreadful disease.’ Research in the UK had shown that culling badgers, which can transmit TB to cattle, could reduce the levels of the disease in herds, and that Britain had to learn from experience elsewhere that the tuberculosis could not effectively be curbed without tackling the problem in wildlife, he said. He added he wanted to see effective and affordable vaccines deployed for both cattle and badgers as quickly as possible but it was likely to take another decade before the deployment of a cattle vaccine which is validated and legal under EU regulations could take place. National Farmers' Union president Peter Kendall welcomed the move, saying it would have been easy for the government to let TB slip down the list of priorities after last year's delay. He backed Mr Paterson for working to ensure that the pilots were up and running this summer and that there would be a full roll-out of the cull next year. Brian May, Queen guitarist and founder of campaign group Save Me, has led opposition to the plans . He said the move mattered because of the damage TB did to the country's food production base, and described the 35,000 cattle which had to be slaughtered because of the disease in 2012 as a ‘scandalous waste’. But Labour, which has consistently opposed a badger cull, criticised the decision. Mary Creagh, the shadow environment secretary, said: ‘The Government is pressing ahead with a badger cull despite 150 000 people signing a petition against it last year and scientists warning against this ""untested and risky approach"". ‘As incompetent Defra ministers stagger from one crisis to the next, the policing costs, paid by the taxpayer, will balloon to £4 million while bovine TB will increase in the next two years as the shooting displaces badgers. ‘Ministers should listen to the public and the scientists and drop this cull before any more public money is wasted.’","Environment Secretary Owen Paterson reveals plan to prevent more delays .

Two young mothers who threatened police officers, spat at doormen and screamed racist abuse on drink-fuelled nights were told they needed to stop drinking by magistrates. Carla Stanway and Nicola Wainwright, both 24, were told to act as 'role models' to their children after they fled an expensive restaurant without paying and were kicked out of a nightclub for stealing drinks. The pair, who both claim benefits, narrowly escaped jail over their ‘appalling behaviour’ – as a magistrate urged them to become better role models for their children. Louts: Carla Stanway (left) and Nicola Wainwright (right), both 24, hurled sickening foul-mouthed abuse at police and spat at doormen who threw them out of a club in Manchester for being drunk and stealing drinks . After being thrown out of the . nightclub, unemployed Stanway, who had given birth just three  weeks . previously, told a doorman: ‘Go back to your own country you Polish . b******.’ Wainwright, who claims working tax . credits, then threatened the club’s staff, saying: ‘I’m going to get 100 . n****** and do you up.

And, according to the counsellors at Relate, the cynics are right – even when a man’s relationship is on the rocks. While women seek help to talk about the couple’s problems, men’s ‘driving force’ is often how to get more sex. The Relate report found that men believe more sex will help a relationship but aren't as happy as women to discuss physical intimacy . The report, based on interviews with . the organisation’s counsellors, also found that men tend to be unaware . their relationship is in trouble, despite obvious warning signs. As a result, they are unlikely to seek help until ‘the ship is sinking’, with some seeing counselling as a form of ‘weakness’. When they do make it to counselling, men approach it very differently . While women are looking for a ‘greater . level of communication and understanding’ and use the sessions as a . chance to review the health of their partnership, men have a more . practical approach. They are more likely to see the session as an . opportunity to ‘problem-solve’ and seek a checklist of things they need . to do to get their relationship back on track. David Wilkins, policy officer at Men’s . Health Forum, carried out the research by interviewing counsellors in . Brighton and Bournemouth. One said: ‘Sometimes the driving force . for men is [if I agree to go to Relate] we will have better . communication and then I will have more sex. ‘I think if you want to get more men through the door, you just have to say “come to counselling and you’ll have more sex!”’ Another commented: ‘Men only tend to ask for help when the ship is sinking. ‘I don’t think they take much action when it is rocky. They are happy to blank that out in the hope it will go away. ‘Women will go and seek [help] before something disastrous happens whereas men tend to need to find a trigger. Another counsellor explained: . ‘Generally, when you’ve got a couple, the men are saying “Right, that’s . it, let’s look at  the solutions and let’s move on from it”. ‘The women generally want to get . underneath and find out “OK, why did that happen? What was going on for . that to happen?” before they can [move on].’ By contrast, they said, a man’s approach tends to be: ‘What are we going to do about it? I need a list. Tell me what to do.’ According to Relate, in the aftermath . of a split men are less likely to have the support of a group of friends . and are at greater risk of suicide. The organisation is calling on health and social workers to tailor relationship support in a ‘male-friendly’ manner. A new report by Relate suggests that while men think having more sex will mend a relationship, they aren't as happy to discuss physical intimacy as women are . Some 66 per cent of men are overweight compared with 57 per cent of women . Mr Wilkins said: ‘I hope we have moved . past the “men are from Mars and women are from Venus” debate but we . can’t ignore the evidence that some men don’t look after their health . and wellbeing as well as they could. ‘It’s a particular problem that men may be more likely to delay seeking help. Support services need to meet men halfway.’ Ruth Sutherland, chief executive of . Relate, said: ‘We have been aware for some time that men don’t like to . trouble their doctors or can’t find time to access health services but . this  is the first time we have really found the same pattern when  it . comes to getting help for,  or even talking about, relationship . difficulties. ‘It is clear that some men need help . that is more practical and solution-focused and the sector must find . ways of adapting our services.’ 'Sometimes the driving force for men is [if I agree to go to Relate] we will have better communication and then I will have more sex'","Men and women deal with emotional distress differently .

Mothers can reduce the chances of having fussy eaters by eating plenty of vegetables during pregnancy . The parental crusade to get children to eat fruit and vegetables should begin before birth, researchers said last night. Pregnant women with a varied diet are less likely to give birth to fussy eaters, they said, and babies are more accepting of foods mothers eat regularly while expectant and breast-feeding. In one study, children whose mothers often drank carrot juice ate twice as much carrot-flavoured cereal when being weaned. Researcher Dr Julie Mennella from the Monell Centre in Philadelphia said: ‘The research clearly shows that if mothers eat a lot of fruit during lactation and pregnancy, then their child will be much more open to eating fruit during weaning. The same goes with vegetables. ‘Babies are biologically hardwired to be attracted to foods containing sugar and salt, but may not be attracted to bitter foods such as green vegetables. 'They have to be exposed to fruit and vegetables if they are to learn to like these flavours. ‘The good news is our research shows babies can learn very early on about healthy foods,’ she said. ‘The message is, eat the healthy food you enjoy and when the baby is old enough to start weaning they will be familiar with those flavours.’ In her research, discussed at the American Association for the Advancement of Science’s annual conference, Dr Mennella tested 46 babies aged between six months and a year for their liking of carrot-flavoured cereal. PUGH . Those whose mothers drank carrot juice several times a week consumed more than 80g of the cereal, compared with only 44g in other babies. ‘It shows how we are primed by our earliest exposures,’ said Dr Mennella. ‘Children get sensory information in the womb and through their mothers’ milk.’ Dr Mennella also found that bottle-fed babies quickly accept fruit and vegetables if they are given them when they start eating solids. In another test, green beans were given to babies for eight days. On the first day, they ate an average of 50g of beans, but over eight days their consumption increased to 80g. ‘Regardless of if a child is breast or bottle-fed, it can still learn as soon as it starts to wean. If they are repeatedly exposed to fruit and vegetables, they soon begin to accept these foods,’ said Dr Mennella. ‘By age two, there is no reason a child should not have the same varied diet as an adult.’ She said hiding broccoli in brownies was not the answer, as children need to learn to like the taste of vegetables independently of other flavours. Volatile chemicals make homegrown tomatoes taste sweeter . Scientists have identified the key chemicals that makes homegrown tomatoes taste so much sweeter than the supermarket varieties. They claim adding more ‘volatiles’ which . enhance the perception of sweetness to commercially-grown tomatoes will . make them more appealing to the public and help increase consumption. And in the future they hope to use the . chemicals to replace sugar in foods and fruit juices to make them . healthier and less calorific. Harry Klee from the University of . Florida said: ‘There are a set of these volatile components that really . enhance the perception of sweetness. 'It is really interesting because . smell is not meant to influence taste because they are completely . different systems, but it does. ‘In theory we could take a fruit juice, . remove a bunch of the sugar, replace it with these volatile chemicals . and greatly reduce the caloric content of that juice, or any food for . that matter, and make it a healthier product without altering our . perception of how sweet it is.’","Babies are more accepting of foods their mothers eat often while pregnant .

An expert criticised confusion over who was clinically responsible for Mr Pattrick, pictured here on holiday in Canada . An under-fire hospital has been criticised by a coroner for ‘serious failings’ after a pensioner was found dead in a hospital toilet. David Pattrick, 69, was discovered lying on the floor of a hospital toilet cubicle at Colchester General Hospital in Essex just two days after a gall bladder operation. Colchester General Hospital is set to be investigated following a damning report into Mid-Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust earlier this month. It is one of 14 NHS trusts running . eight hospitals are to be investigated because they have 'persistently . high' death rates over the past two years. Today coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray slammed the hospital for a number of failings in their care for the retired banker. Mr Pattrick, from Marks Tey, near Colchester, Essex, was admitted to the hospital in December 2010, to have his gall bladder removed after suffering severe gall stones. Independent expert Jonathan Refson, consultant at Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow, Essex, criticised confusion over who was clinically responsible for Mr Pattrick during his hospital admission. He told Chelmsford Coroners’ Court last week: 'Everyone popped in and popped out. No one took ownership of his care.' Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray slammed the hospital for a number of failings in their care for the retired banker . Mr Pattrick continued to suffer from . severe abdominal pain for two days after the operation as staff missed . key signs he may have become septic. On . the day of his death a foundation doctor who had just four months . experience as a trainee doctor was put in charge of his care. That evening Mr Pattrick was found collapsed in a toilet cubicle on December 23, 2010. Coroner . Caroline Beasley-Murray today made a number of findings in relation to the . case after accepting Mr Pattrick had died of natural causes from . septicaemia. She noted that Colchester Hospital had provided insufficient pre-operative counselling. David Pattrick, 69, pictured with his wife Susan, was found dead in a toilet cubicle in Colchester General Hospital . There was a failure of consultants to take responsibility of care and poor supervision of junior trainees. Finally she said there was a failure of junior staff to escalate the problem to senior staff. She concluded: 'There were serious failings in the care Mr Pattrick received during his stay at Colchester Hospital. 'It is pleasing to see Colchester Hospital appear to have now learnt lessons.' Grieving widow Susan Pattrick, who is suing Colchester General Hospital for neglect, welcomed the damning verdict. After the inquest she said: 'I’m very pleased with the verdict and the fact the coroner found serious failings. 'These are the things that need to be addressed. 'The NHS in general has a good reputation for dealing with people and this is, I hope, just an isolated incident. 'Unfortunately I think it is the system which caused my husband’s death. 'Modern wards now have a central desk with bays off it so nurses can’t see the patients and I think this is going to cause more and more problems in the future. 'I don’t want anyone else to have to go through what I did.' A spokesman for Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust said: 'We would like to offer our heartfelt condolences and sympathy to the family of Mr David Pattrick following his death in December 2010. 'We accept the Coroner’s verdict and are pleased that she acknowledged that the Trust has taken the issues raised by this case seriously, learned lessons and made improvements since Mr Pattrick died more than two years ago. 'For example, leave and cover arrangements for consultants have been made more robust, steps taken to ensure the results of any emergency investigations are reviewed at the earliest possible opportunity, and pain assessment training provided for healthcare assistants.

A Serious Case Review following the death of a teenager who was tied to a tree, tortured, sexually assaulted and killed has recommended 111 separate changes in procedure to the agencies that dealt with her. It found the extent of her vulnerabilities 'was not understood by professionals working with her' and a found a wealth of ways agencies care of her was 'weak'. Hannah Windsor, 17, suffered an horrific death last May at the hands of her sadistic boyfriend Adam Lewis, who pleaded guilty to murder, two charges of assault, burglary, and arson at his trial last year and denied two charges of rape. He was ordered to serve a minimum of 22 years in jail when he appeared at Liverpool Crown Court. Hannah Windsor, who was tortured and killed by her sadistic boyfriend, Adam Lewis, was 'not understood' by agencies caring for her . Mr Justice Holroyde had told Lewis: 'This was a prolonged, merciless and terrible attack which must have been agonisingly painful for Hannah Windsor before she died.' The case review was ordered immediately following the hearing. The report, which is anonymised - referring to Hannah as 'Child G' - contains 111 separate recommendations for changes to procedures, training and issuing extra guidance to staff. It found that although her murder at the hands of Lewis could not reasonably have been forseen, service provision by the professional agencies that were supposed to look after her was 'diffuse and lacked co-ordination'. In the days before Hannah’s death, Lewis had been sleeping rough hiding out on Bidston Hill after a warrant was issued for his arrest for burglary and arson. The report describes how Hannah was helping police find him but had been warned about approaching the killer by a policewoman. However she ignored the advice. CCTV pictures released after the trial showed the teenager walking along a leafy pathway at the hill as she went to meet him. She was dead a matter of hours later and her body discovered under twigs and leaves. The vulnerable teenager was murdered near Bidston Observatory at Bidston Hill in Wirral, Merseyside Liverpool . The review charts how Hannah had a difficult childhood and discloses that over the years, the youngster had contact with a large number of agencies and organisations. Representative of health, education, social care, police, youth offending and housing services were all involved. But no multi-agency 'holistic' assessment of her needs, characteristics and behaviour took place. The review found: . In February 2012, she was provided with accommodation as a homeless young person. An assessment should have taken place at this point to consider whether she was 'in need' and required local authority accommodation. The report found that although Hannah was found to have been neglected, there was almost no challenge to those responsible about the care they provided for her. The report says a such a plan is the basic requirement of child protection work and each member of the core group had individual, as well as collective, responsibility to Hannah to ensure that this requirement was met. Hannah was helping police find her boyfriend but had been warned about approaching the killer by a policewoman . Local Safeguarding Children’s Board procedures and good practice guides were not systematically consulted and were not always applied as they were intended to be. A press release from Wirral Council states: 'The review found that agencies working with [Hannah] could not have foreseen what happened to her.' It continues: 'The overview report makes recommendations, all of which are now part of an action plan which will be reviewed and updated regularly by the Local Safeguarding Children’s Board. Dennis Charlton, independent chairman of the board, said: 'I would like, on behalf of all members of the LSCB, to extend our deepest condolences to Child G’s family and anyone who knew her. 'I know that a number of people who work for agencies associated with Child G’s care knew her personally, and were greatly affected and saddened by her death. 'The board have accepted the findings and recommendations of the Review which was commissioned by the LSCB following Child G’s death. 'We are already working on a number of areas which have been identified, where assessments, multi-agency work and information sharing were not of a sufficient standard to provide a framework for co-ordinated actions and interventions.' Progress on these recommendations will be monitored and updated regularly by the LSCB, and the results will contribute to child protection practice in Wirral and will be used to inform further action and training.","Hannah Windsor was tied to a tree, tortured and killed by her boyfriend .

The disciplinary panel found that she was 'not fundamentally dishonest' and had worked hard to mediate her conduct since the incident. Ms Hurds said she had sought no intentional financial benefit and had a 'previously unblemished nursing career'. Ms Leighton spent six weeks in jail when she was arrested in connection with the deaths on the acute care wards of the Stockport hospital in 2011 but was released when prosecutors concluded there was not enough evidence against her. The police investigation revealed she had removed packets of painkillers and opiate-based drugs from the hospital. She admitted taking the medicine, which was discovered in her bedroom. A total of 22 people suffered hypoglycaemic episodes between June and July 2011 at Stepping Hill after their saline drips were allegedly sabotaged with insulin. Eight of them - all of whom were being treated on acute care wards for seriously ill patients - have now died. The panel said it was impressed by the 'robust portfolio' of information Ms Leighton presented to show her continuing dedication to the profession. It included evidence of academic learning, testimonials and signs that she had gained a 'significant insight into her misconduct', Ms Hurds said. It was also noted that Ms Leighton had 'the most difficult of personal circumstances' but she did not try to cover up her actions which brought the profession into disrepute. In fact she co-operated with the investigation. Probe: A police investigation into deaths at Stepping Hill (above) revealed Ms Leighton had removed packets of painkillers and opiate-based drugs from the hospital . Her colleagues are 'accepting her for . her ability and not judging her for her past' and they have 'confidence . and trust' in her, the panel heard. During . her disciplinary hearing, Ms Leighton claimed staff would take drugs . such as the painkiller ibuprofen from the hospital, sometimes for use . during their holidays in 'case of emergencies'. Tom . Hoskins, for the NMC, said: 'She said that if the police were to search . any number of employees from Stepping Hill Hospital, a random person, . they would find them also in possession of such tablets.' Paul . Rooney, for Ms Leighton, told the hearing the nurse admitted the . allegations against her which related to seven drugs, including the . opiate-based tramadol capsules which she is accused of supplying or . intending to supply. Accused: Ms Leighton appears at Manchester Magistrates Court in July 2011 after being arrested in connection with the deaths of patients on the acute care wards of Stepping Hill. She was later cleared after prosecutors said there was not enough evidence against her . He said: 'Ms Leighton accepts that these charges amount to misconduct and further accepts that by that misconduct, she has brought the profession into disrepute and therefore her current fitness to practise is impaired.' When questioned, Ms Leighton said she took ibuprofen for a sore throat and the antibiotics to treat the onset of tonsillitis, which she believed would prevent her from having to take time off work, the panel heard. She thought she was entitled to remove the drugs for her own use but conceded the medication was not prescribed to her, Mr Hoskins said. Interviews with other members of staff employed by the hospital appeared to contradict her suggestion that taking drugs from Stepping Hill Hospital was commonplace. An investigation by the trust revealed only two employees were aware of the alleged practice but they claimed it was limited to paracetamol and did not extend to prescription drugs, the hearing was told.","Rebecca Leighton took painkillers and opiate-based drugs from the hospital .

"By . Anna Edwards . PUBLISHED: . 20:50 EST, 1 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:58 EST, 2 March 2013 . Defence Secretary Philip Hammond has warned he will fight further cuts to the armed forces in Chancellor George Osborne's forthcoming spending review. After No 10 warned publicly last month that the military would not be immune from further financial retrenchment, Mr Hammond made clear that he would resist anything more than modest 'efficiency savings'. He instead demanded the welfare budget should be slashed instead. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond will resist any proposed cuts to the Armed Forces in George Osborne's budget. In an interview with The Daily Telegraph, he said other Conservative Cabinet ministers believed that the greatest burden of any cuts should fall on the welfare budget. There was, he said, a 'body of opinion within Cabinet who believes that we have to look at the welfare budget again', and that 'we should be seeing welfare spending falling' as a result of rising employment levels. He said the 'first priority' for the Government should be 'defending the country and maintaining law and order' and that further defence cuts were not possible while meeting stated security objectives. 'I shall go into the spending review fighting the case for the defence budget on the basis that we have made very large cuts to defence, we've done that with the collaboration and co-operation of the military,' he said. Mr Hammond said further defence cuts were not possible while meeting stated security objectives . 'Any further reduction in the defence budget would fall on the level of activity that we were able to carry out - the idea that expensively bought equipment may not be able to be used, expensively employed troops may not be able to be exercised and trained as regularly as they need to be. 'I am not going into the spending review offering any further reductions in personnel.' Mr Hammond's comments are likely to be welcomed by Tory backbenchers who have been calling for a return to a core Conservative values in the wake of the party's trouncing in the Eastleigh by-election. However they will also heighten tensions within the coalition, with the Liberal Democrats resisting a further squeeze on welfare spending. It was being made clear Mr Hammond's comments were aimed particularly at the Lib Dems following remarks by senior Lib Dem ministers indicating that they believed welfare spending should be protected over defence. A Whitehall source said: 'There is a real concern that the Lib Dems wants to protect the benefits culture at the expense of the armed forces'. Former Chief of the Air Staff, Sir Michael Graydon, agreed with Mr Hammond's view.He told BBC Radio 5: 'We have great capability gaps now, which we never had before. 'For example, we have no maritime patrol aircraft at all, we have no aircraft that can go on carriers - in fact we barely have carriers any longer. 'The army is now at a level, or will be shortly, it has never been that low for 200 years. That must surely worry people.'","Phillip Hammond says welfare budget should be slashed to reflect 'rising employment'

"By . Anna Edwards . PUBLISHED: . 13:33 EST, 27 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:17 EST, 28 February 2013 . A former CEO at the BBC has been accused of saying women with children should not hold senior management positions because they are not 'focused'. Mark Thomas, who had £200,000 a year role, allegedly began bullying a male employee who 'stood up to him' over the alleged sexual discrimination. Byron Myers, who worked for Mr Thomas as an HR manager, is claiming he was bullied by him to a point where he had to quit his £77,000 a year job, a tribunal in Watford, Hertfordshire, said. Mr Myers claims the reason why Mr Thomas, who was the Chief Executive Officer of BBC Studios and Post Production, turned against him in 2011, because he dared to speak up about what happened when a woman manager with young children wanted to work part time. Mark Thomas (right) denies ever making sexist remarks after Byron Myers (left) accused him of bullying him . Mr Myers, 39, said that during negotiations with Katy Child, Mr Thomas told him women with 'child caring responsibilities' should not hold senior management positions because they were not 'focused.' He claims the then CEO came up with the idea of offering her a job share with conditions of acceptance so 'onerous' that she would have to refuse the offer. Mr Myers says the woman was unhappy when offered a job sharing role that required her to work around 10 weeks of the year full time and was 'unworkable.' He alleges that at one point during his discussions with Mr Thomas about the situation, his boss told him: 'That b**** has had every guy in here wrapped around her fingers.' The tribunal has heard from Mr Myers that he eventually turned 'whistle blower' and claimed he found himself being bullied and belittled by his boss in the months that followed. Mr Myers, from London, is claiming unfair dismissal, constructive dismissal and breach of contract. Giving evidence today Mr Thomas, who himself left the BBC in 2012, said he was appointed as CEO of the department in 2008. Mr Thomas said he was in talks with the unions over planned department moves to Salford, redundancies and pension changes . He said he was involved in talks with the unions over planned department moves to Salford, redundancies and pension changes. In January of 2011 he said he had a meeting with Ms Child, who was Head of Commercial Development. He said the mother of two young children wanted to discuss her future and he said: 'I was very clear with her that I wanted to retain her talents within S&PP, that I rated her and it would be a good outcome to keep her in a different role.' He said it was his suggestion that she consider the job of Operations Manager working in Digital Media Services. Mr Thomas said she was already working part time and the new job had been conceived as a full time post. However, he said she told him it was possible her husband could also be made redundant and, if that happened, she might consider doing the job on a full time basis. He said he advised her to speak to the head of Digital Media Services, Clive Hodge as well as Mr Myers about the 'likely redundancy situation,' so she had all the facts. He said: 'I do not discriminate against female employees or hold the view or perception that women with child caring responsibilities should not hold senior management positions as they are less focused on the job. 'A number of employees worked flexibly during my time as CEO to accommodate childcare responsibilities, including three women who have management positions.' He said he was 'disappointed' that little progress seemed to be made in the negotiations with Ms Child in the weeks that followed and that Mr Myers had had little dealings with her. Eventually, he said he learned she had come back with a proposal for the job to be shared and that she had identified a potential job sharer. However, he told the tribunal, he did have concerns about the plan that Mr Myers and Mr Hodge had come up with for flexible working, especially since all three people involved in the job share had young children. He said he had real concerns about the 'continuity of leadership' being maintained at all times and pointed this out to Mr Myers and Mr Hodge.' 'My concern was that no consideration had been given to how the job sharers would cover each other's leave.' 'I didn't think the proposed job share currently met the business needs and asked Mr Myers to revisit these issues with Mr Hodge and Katy to find a way through.' He added: 'My approach as CEO was to minimise the risk to the business.' He denied every saying Ms Child was a 'bitch' who wrapped men in the office around her finger. He denied saying the remark about women with child caring responsibilities should not hold senior management positions because they were not focused. He told the hearing 'I do not believe I treated Mr Myers in a detrimental way at any time. I did not bully or undermine him or isolate him in decision making.' He added: 'I would need to chase him for information or to deliver on an action I has assigned. 'I would find myself having to ask questions about situations I would have expected Mr Myers to have already asked. 'I often provided feedback on Mr Myers' inter-personal skills, in particular his team working skills and how he interacted with colleagues.' He said he found that Mr Myers could be rude to his colleagues and he would comment on it. 'I had noticed that when provided with feedback he didn't like it, he had a tendency to over react, dismiss or deflect it by twisting what was being said to him.' He said at no time during May 2011 had he spread rumours that Mr Myers was on his way out due to making his disclosures. Mr Thomas said he was 'shocked' at the way Mr Myers had 'twisted events.' The tribunal continues.","Then CEO Mark Thomas allegedly called female employee a 'b****'

But if George Osborne was hoping for a better performance away from the office, he'd better steer well clear of the PE hall. When the Chancellor was last there, he tried his hand at skipping with less than flattering consequences and was even upstaged by a group of primary school pupils. Embarrassing footage has now emerged of that moment as he tied himself in knots trying to complete as many skips as possible in two minutes. Scroll down for videos . Ready to go: Chancellor George Osborne prepares to take part in an official competition between MPs to complete as many skips as possible in two minutes during a visit to a primary school . Embarrassing: The video has emerged just days after the Chancellor was dealt a humiliating blow when Britain's coveted AAA credit rating was downgraded . The video, believed to have been taken a few years ago, shows him at a primary school while taking part in an ongoing unofficial competition between MPs. He starts tentatively and within just a few seconds gets himself in one of many tangles as the children around continue merrily skipping with far more success. In the end, he manages just 48 skips, even fewer than 65-year-old Ann Widdecombe. Other unflattering footage shows Deputy . Prime Minister Nick Clegg and shadow Chancellor Ed Balls taking part . with a little more success. More than 100 are currently involved, with a league table showing the Palace of Westminster's best performers.

Ropeless: The chancellor managed just 48 skips in two minutes, fewer even than 65-year-old former Home Office minister Ann Widdecombe . The deputy prime minister ranks in the middle of the list with 152, while the chancellor languishes near the bottom with 48. Disgraced former MP Chris Huhne is the worst performing MP, managing just 27. They were both outperformed by Ms Widdecombe, who posted a respectable score of 78 skips. In one of the videos, released to The Evening Standard, Mr Clegg says he is 'exhausted' by the efforts. Meanwhile shadow secretary of state for health Andy Burnham joked he would text Mr Balls to taunt him when he beat his score of 138 by four. The challenge was devised by former boxer John McCormack, who has spent the past seven years persuading people in power to lose their inhibitions and take part.

The attempts take place either at local primary schools, or at the Houses of Parliament themselves. Mr McCormack said he has been amazed at just how many MPs have got involved. He said: 'Obviously the point in this was to get the children fit. The MPs have been brilliant over the years, yes they may look a little bit silly, but they've nearly all been up for giving it a go to show the children how it's done. 'We've had MPs feel ill, fall over and get ultra competitive. When Andy Burnham did it he said he was going to text Ed Balls to tell him he had beaten his score. 'Ann Widdecombe got the rope and ran around the room with it before the music had even started, beating a lot of the men - even at her age.

Britain suffered its first-ever sovereign ratings downgrade from a major agency last Friday when Moody's stripped the country of its coveted triple-A rating. It was a major blow to Mr Osborne, who had vowed to defend the UK's credit status when the Coalition came to power in 2010. Moody's said weak prospects for British economic growth, which have thrown the government's deficit reduction strategy off course, lay behind its decision to cut the rating by one notch to Aa1 from Aaa.Austerity has been the watchword for Mr Osborne's fiscal policy. But a very slow recovery from the financial crisis has pushed back by at least two years the government's goal of largely eliminating the budget deficit by 2015's election.

A young girl was dragged to the feet of her rapist and forced to apologise to him after her father refused to believe she was being sexually abused. Tina Rogers was just 11 years old when her uncle began raping her on a weekly basis at her grandparents' home, while her family laughed and joked downstairs oblivious to what was happening. Finally, more than two decades after the abuse started, 63-year-old Colin Dunn was jailed for 16 years for sexually assaulting children over a 50-year period. Justice finally served: Tina Rogers (left) was just 11 years old when her uncle Colin Dunn (right) began raping her on daily basis, but she was made to apologise to him after her father refused to believe her story . He was found guilty of seven offences of rape and two charges of indecent assault at Burnley Crown Court on February 12. Sex pervert Dunn told an innocent Tina he was the only one in her family that loved her before grooming her and forcing her to have sex with him against her will. Tina, now 37, was then forced to live with the horror of her abuse after bravely trying to confide in her father, before being dragged to apologise to her rapist when her family refused to believe the allegations. Tina, from Preston, Lancashire, said: 'I went to tell my dad that Colin was touching me. I wanted to tell him he was having sex with me, but I was scared how he would react. I said he was touching my bottom. 'Dad went mad. He dragged me up to his house and made me apologise to Colin's face. My uncle sneered down and me and said he wouldn't do anything like that to me. 'None of my family would believe me. I could describe his bedroom, but it didn't matter. No-one would listen.' Tina grew up in what she believed to be a . tight-knit family, so as a child there appeared nothing wrong with her . spending time with her loving uncle. Innocent: Tina, pictured here aged three, grew up in what she believed to be a tight-knit family, so as a child there appeared nothing wrong with her spending time with her 'loving' uncle . But his actions soon turned sinister, as he encouraged Tina to spend more time with him. She said: 'The first time I remember anything happening was when I was putting food into the fish tank. He sat on a chair behind me and put his legs around me, and then he started touching me. 'I was naive, I didn't know what sex was. It didn't occur to me what he was doing to me was wrong and I believed that he loved me. 'Colin said we would both get into trouble but especially me, so I didn't say a word. I had sex with him too many times.' But as Tina got older, she began to realise that her relationship with Dunn was not what it should be. She said: 'I was watching TV one night and there was a prostitute on the screen. My mum said she was dirty. I then realised what was happening to me was wrong as well.' Unloved: As a teenager, Tina says she was put into care and even called a 'reject' by her mother . As a teenager, Tina, who has an older brother and sister, was put into care and even called a 'reject' by her mother. She said: 'They got rid of me. I was told to shut up or it would be ten times worse.' When she was 21, Tina finally found the courage to report her rapist. She said: 'I was terrified he was doing what he had done to me to other girls.' Dunn was arrested and the charges were put to him. But while he was in police custody, he collapsed and was taken to hospital. Police said there wasn't enough evidence against him and Tina was forced to watch her attacker walk free. More than a decade after Tina was forced to believe Dunn would never be convicted of his crimes, he was handed a 32-month sentence after confessing to attacking five and six-year-old girls he had befriended close to his home. He lured the youngsters with toys, Easter eggs and promises to look after their animals. Following the conviction in October 2011, Tina's statement was reviewed and Dunn was finally charged with two counts of rape on her as a child. Tina said: 'Two girls came forward and told police what he had done to them. 'Those little children that have spoken out deserve a medal for being so brave, and so do their parents for supporting them and believing them. 'I can't apologise enough to the other parents because it shouldn't have happened.' Passing sentence, Judge Beverley Lunt told Dunn: 'It cannot be said that at any stage of your life you led a blameless existence. 'For decades you have been a perverted sexual abuser who has preyed on young girls.' Dunn admitted the charges due to the amount of evidence served against him. 'He had nothing left,' Tina added. 'When I saw him in court, I stared right at him. He looked empty. It was the closest I had been to him in a long time. 'I felt relieved to see him sentenced. I can't believe it's finally over. I've waited so long for justice. 'But while I know he is being punished, it will always hurt that I was disbelieved by my family about it for so long.' Detective Constable Matt Capper, of the Pennine policing division's public protection unit said: 'Dunn is a predatory and dangerous man whose offending spanned decades. 'His offending has not only had significant health implications for his victim but they will now have to live with this for the rest of their lives. 'They showed immense bravery and courage in coming forward. I hope this sentence will offer a degree of closure and allow them to move forward with their lives.'","Tina Rogers was raped on daily basis by uncle Colin Dunn from age 11 .

A son was denied a fair slice of his dead mother's £1m fortune after he stopped visiting her and neglected to send flowers on Mother's Day, the High Court has heard. Kenneth Hart is suing his sister, Susan Burbidge, 47, whom he claims controlled his 'vulnerable' mother Phyllis Hart's finances in the months before her death aged 86 in November 2008. He and his brother, Paul, 49, are now urging a High Court judge to overturn cash and property transfers worth around £450,000 executed by their mother in Susan's favour in the year before she died. Legal battle: Kenneth Hart (left) is suing his sister Susan Burbidge (right) over claims he was denied a fair slice of their late mother's £1m fortune because he stopped visiting her and didn't send flowers on Mother's Day . Kenneth, 67, described his mother as a 'good woman and housewife' but claimed she 'could not make up her mind about anything' - even when it came to choosing her own curtains. And she had no idea about financial matters, he told the court. Phyllis was widowed when his father, Ernest, died in 2005, Mr Hart told the court, inheriting the £1m-plus fortune Ernest had created through a thriving marquee business, Ernest Hart and Sons. By 2007, his mother was increasingly under his sister's influence, insisted Kenneth, claiming that 'any suggestion you made to mother would have to be passed by Susan'. Tension was already building within the family after Phyllis announced the previous year that she was transferring part of the company's business premises to Susan, the court heard. Kenneth, from Poole, Dorset, said this news left him 'annoyed' and conceded that he went for at least 12 months without visiting his mother, although he 'never stopped caring for her'. Family feud: Mr Hart his brother, Paul are urging the High Court (pictured) to overturn cash and property transfers worth around £450,000 executed by their mother in Susan's favour in the year before she died . His sister's barrister, Paul Emmerson, suggested that Kenneth had succeeded in 'alienating' his mother, who had become increasingly 'angry and bitter' at his apparent indifference. She had every right to 'seek sanctuary' with her daughter and son-in-law, said the barrister, as they were 'doing everything for her' and had taken her in. Mr Emmerson also cited complaints made by Phyllis about Kenneth's alleged neglect of his filial duties, including his failure to send her flowers on Mother's Day and sending a Christmas card 'which didn't even have the word mother on it'. She was 'entitled to feel upset and to distribute her property as she wanted', he added. Kenneth said he had always loved his mother but Mr Emmerson suggested he 'could have made her aware of how you felt about her'. 'You could have stayed in more regular . contact, and you could have written to her or sent her Christmas and . birthday cards?' the barrister put to him. Claims: Mr Hart's mother, Phyllis, allegedly complained about his apparent neglect of his filial duties, including his failure to send her flowers on Mother's Day . 'I think I did send her Christmas cards,' Kenneth replied, although accepting that he 'could have done more'. He had been working long hours and into weekends, he said, and had done his best to keep in touch when she moved house during her final year, also denying any terminal rift with his mother. Describing the family culture he told the court: 'We were never a close family and could go for weeks and weeks without seeing one another, but we were never at loggerheads'. The Hart brothers' barrister, Charles Auld, argued that Phyllis' transactions in her daughter's favour 'call for an explanation' and urged the judge to rule them invalid unless Susan can establish that her mother was acting of her own free will. But Mr Emmerson argued that Phyllis was 'not the vulnerable old lady' portrayed by her sons. She had 'come out of herself' since the death of her controlling husband, he told the court, and managed to weather a series of 'hectoring' exchanges with Paul, some of which he taped, said the barrister. 'She was strong and independent of thought, and perfectly capable of standing up to Paul Hart and being annoyed by his actions and the apparent indifference of Ken Hart,' he told the court. The brothers' lawyers say that, by the time of Phyllis' death, nearly everything her husband had left her - valued at over £1m - had been transferred to Susan Burbidge and her husband, Brian, subject to an 'unsigned loan agreement' that the couple would pay back £410,000 into her estate. Kenneth and Paul are asking Judge Sir William Blackburne to overturn a £290,000 cash transfer to Susan and her husband and the transfer of the proceeds of sale of the Hart family home in Beacon Park Road, Upton, Poole, to the couple. Phyllis had lived in that house throughout her marriage but moved into Little Manor Farm, in Poole, shortly before her death. The brothers' claim is being hotly contested by Susan and Brian Burbidge.

A college lecturer landed in court after standing up to bullies who attacked her young son in the street. Shannon Sibley, 48, was charged with a breach of the peace after her nine-year-old son was punched and had abuse hurled at him by a group of teenagers. Miss Sibley, from Carfin, Lanarkshire, took her car out to find those responsible and confront them after her son had been reduced to tears. The mother-of-two caught up with her son's tormentors, who had been selling sweets in her housing estate, and after a heated exchange returned home. 'Upset': College lecturer Shannon Sibley (above) ended up in court after confronting bullies who punched her nine-year-old son . But she was reported to the police after a witness saw the incident on May 20 last year. Miss Sibley, a senior lecturer in travel and tourism at Anniesland College in Glasgow, appeared at Hamilton Sheriff Court where she pleaded guilty to the offence. But Sheriff David Bicket gave her an absolute discharge and told her he 'understood' the reasons for her actions after hearing the case. Today, Tory politician Margaret Mitchell MSP blasted prosecutors for allowing the case to reach court. She said: 'I think the sheriff has looked at all the mitigating factors and decided that there wasn't a reason to punish this woman despite the position taken by prosecutors that a crime had taken place. 'I can't help but sympathise with her and feel that the sheriff certainly came to the right decision by dealing with the case with an absolute discharge.' Depute fiscal Fiona Kirkby told the court how the incident had unfolded. She said: 'The accused's son, aged nine, was involved in an incident with the complainer, a young male aged 13. 'He came home and was very upset. The complainer and a group of friends had been selling sweets round houses in the area. 'After her son returned home, the accused then got into her car and arrived at the locus and confronted the complainer. In the dock: Miss Sibley, a senior lecturer in travel and tourism at Anniesland College in Glasgow, appeared at Hamilton Sheriff Court (above) where she pleaded guilty to the offence . 'She asked him why he assaulted her son and shouted 'How would you like to be bullied' and similar utterances. 'The accused was extremely angry. A female witness who had been buying sweets from the complainer split the confrontation up. 'The witness then tried to note Miss Sibley's registration down as she drove away at which point she opened the car window and shouted her address to the woman. 'The witness then attended to the boy who was shaken by the incident and it was reported to police.' Defence lawyer Heather McCracken said: 'Miss Sibley's son was playing in the street outside their home with a friend. 'The complainer and a number of his friends made certain taunts and offensive remarks to the nine-year-old child who was wearing a green top. 'Miss Sibley's son was then hit and he returned home. The group who were involved in the altercation were not from the area and were selling tablets and sweets round the doors of the estate. 'She took her son in the car to find the boys who were responsible for the assault. When she confronted the boy, she was told to f*** off. 'She then felt threatened by a forward movement by the complainer and made a pushing away gesture. 'Miss Sibley is a college lecturer and holds a high up position in the education authority and has assisted children affected by poverty. 'To say this episode has had a profound effect on Miss Sibley is an understatement.' Miss Sibley said: 'This has cost me thousands of pounds and caused great upset. I don't want to talk about it.' Sheriff David Bicket said: 'I am satisfied that this was a one off incident and although I do not condone it I understand the explanation behind the offence. I am discharging you absolutely.'","Shannon Sibley, 48, charged over heated exchange with youngsters .

Groomed to be stars: PE teacher Stephen Benson, 50, allegedly raped two 15-year-old girls and abused a 14-year-old . A former national athletics coach raped two girls he trained and promised to make sports stars, a court heard today. PE teacher Stephen Benson, 50, allegedly groomed his victims by taking control of their lives, going on family holidays with them and promising to turn them into future athletics stars. Ipswich Crown Court heard how he allegedly raped two 15-year-old girls, suggesting to one that he would no longer coach her if she did not have sex with him. A third alleged victim was also repeatedly abused at the age of 14 at her family home after Benson became a regular visitor. Benson of Copdock near Ipswich, Suffolk, denies 11 charges of rape, six of indecent assault, two of sexual activity with a child and two of sexual assault between 1989 and 2010. Prosecutor Riel Karmy-Jones said: ‘This case is about the misuse of power by an older man against those who looked up to him and saw him as their mentor. ‘For a period of over 20 years, he abused his position of trust by grooming a series of girls for his own benefit and sexual gratification. ‘He also groomed parents as well as children. They liked him and he wormed his way into their lives. He was initially charming and expressed an interest in their daughters' talents. ‘What parent would not have felt the same when told that their daughter might become a great star? ‘He would go to the girls' rooms to discuss their training and would stay longer and later. His visits became more regular and he even managed to go on holidays with families. ‘He inveigled himself into families and their lives, so he was able to gain control of the girls. He made them feel that running was the only thing that mattered and they must do his bidding. ‘He controlled their diet, sleeping and social lives and manipulated them so he could sexually abuse them.’ The court heard how the alleged victims were now all adults but had never met each other. Benson was said to have carried out his abuse while he was a PE teacher at Copleston High School in Ipswich and a coach at the Ipswich Harriers running club. He was described in court as 'a high ranking athletics' coach and worked as a national cross-country coach for UK Athletics training athletes for national and international events . The alleged offences came to light after his last alleged victim decided to report him. 'High ranking athletics' coach: Benson was said to have carried out his abuse while he was a PE teacher at Copleston High School (pictured) in Ipswich and a coach at the Ipswich Harriers running club . Miss Karmy-Jones told officers how . Benson had invited the girl to join his 'elite runners club' several . years previously and befriended her mother. He . became a regular visitor to her home for evening meals and began saying . goodnight to her in her room at night, she said. Benson started off by . stroking her back before trying to force her hand on his genitals and . rubbing her breasts on the pretext of carrying out a sports massage, she . added. Miss Karmy-Jones . said the girl was embarrassed and felt his behaviour was 'wrong and . disgusting', but she went along with it because she wanted him to be her . coach. 'Manipulated them': The court heard that he allegedly forced one of the girls to touch his genitals and rubbed her breasts on the pretext of carrying out a sports massage . Police later visited a woman who was coached by Benson several years earlier. When the officers told her they were reinvestigating him, she put her head in her hands and started to sob. She told officers how Benson regularly visited her home, tried to control her diet and stopped her seeing friends. He allegedly began stroking her hair, the holding her hand when they went out before having sex with her six to eight times, said Miss Karmy-Jones. Benson allegedly told her: ‘I will stop training you if you don't do it.’ Miss Karmy-Jones added: ‘Running was something she as good at. It became her life and she didn't want to stop. He made her feel it was a real threat hanging over her.’ He had sex with her in her bedroom, at his parents' home, in his car and in Thetford forest, she said. She said: ‘As she became older she realised it was not normal. He would listen to George Michael in his car. Now if she listens to George Michael, she has to turn it off because it makes her feel sick. ‘He did not use force of a physical nature, but it was coercion of a man in power and authority. ‘She did not consent to sex with him, but she knew if she didn't he would make her life hell. She didn't report it to police at the time because she was embarrassed and did not think she would be believed.' A second woman who was visited to police also told officers how Benson had sex with her when she was aged 15, even though she never consented. She said that Benson also befriended her family and exerted power and control over her. The . woman told officers that Benson had originally forced her to perform . sex acts on him when they were alone and later had full sex with her. 'Abused his position of trust': Ipswich Crown Court (pictured) heard how Benson groomed girls for 'his own benefit and sexual gratification' and 'wormed his way into their lives,' Prosecutor Riel Karmy-Jones said . Miss Karmy-Jones said: ‘She was aware that it was not right - but she was his protégé and he was her mentor.’ When arrested over the most recent alleged abuse, Benson denied any wrongdoing and claimed that the girl had formed 'a crush' on him and had idolised him. Later he admitted having consensual sex with the other two teenagers but said it happened when they were aged over 16 and it was not illegal at the time. Miss Karmy-Jones said: ‘Submitting to sex is not necessarily the same as consent. It is the Crown's case that these young women did not consent, accept for the pressure put on them. ‘The defendant may have had genuine feelings for them, but those feelings were misplaced because of his age and position. ‘What he did was wrong on any moral compass.’ The trial continues.

A man has admitted putting his girlfriend through a terrifying ordeal when he dangled her from a motorway bridge by her thighs and threatened to let go. Adam Scott, 20, was drunk when he dangled her from a motorway bridge as cars drove beneath sounding their horns at the pair. The attack on the bridge came after a series of assaults by Scott which saw him threatening to kill partner Chelsea Ewart. Even after he was arrested and in custody, he got friends to pass on messages to try and make her retract her complaint against him, Exeter Crown Court heard. Scott, 20, of Exmouth, Devon, last year was falsely accused of a rape in Manchester after a DNA mix up - when he had never before travelled north of Bristol. Now he is back in custody after pleading guilty to harassment and witness intimidation. Scott admitted putting his ex girlfriend in fear through harassment. The charge states that between November 8 and 30 last year he carried out a series of attacks. The charge says: ‘He caused Chelsea . Ewart to fear violence would be used. He hit her and pulled her hair on . numerous occasions and threatened to kill her using the gas cooker at . their home. ‘He frightened her with a knife and . held his forearm around her throat.

More wind turbines are being built in Britain than ever before as the country becomes the third highest wind power generator in Europe. More than 1,200 turbines are set to start generating power over the next 12 months in a trend thought to be motivated by a planned cut in subsidies, due to come into effect in April. New figures also showed that the UK has overtaken Italy and France, generating 8.4 gigawatts of wind energy, according to the European Wind Energy Association (EWEA). Wind power: More wind turbines are being built in Britain than ever before in a trend thought to be motivated by a planned cut in subsidies, due to come into effect in April . The building of onshore turbines is up 60 per cent since last year with 763 turbines due to be built, while another 7,843 have building approval but are yet to be constructed, according to The Daily Telegraph. A Department of Energy and Climate Change spokesperson said that 63 per cent of onshore wind planning applications were approved last year. The wind power generated by the 4,369 turbines already in operation in Britain is enough to power an equivalent of more than 4.6 million homes. Maf Smith, deputy chief executive from RenewableUK, which provides energy sector data said: ‘The Government is calling for the UK to quadruple the amount of wind installed between now and 2020. ‘Wind as a crucial part of our energy . mix and is becoming more important as extra onshore and offshore . capacity is added to the system. ‘The industry can achieve 31 gigawatts onshore and offshore by the end of the decade, but only with clear cross-party political support.’ 'We can attract billions of pounds worth of investment to the UK and create tens of thousands of jobs, but only if the signals from Westminster are right. ‘The proof of this will be in the Energy Bill, which is due to become law by the end of the year. So the decisions taken by Government over next few months are absolutely crucial for the UK’s wind industry.' The Department of Energy and Climate Change announced the 10 per cent subsidy cut to onshore wind turbines last year, in a move they say will encourage up to £25billion in new investment in generating energy. Extreme weather: Just last week a 115ft, £250,000 wind turbine in Bradworthy, Devon was blown over by high winds, three years after it was built . Dr John Constable, director of the Renewable Energy Foundation, was quoted in the Daily Telegraph saying: ‘The UK's wind power deployment on and offshore is way ahead of the learning curve and needs to slow down to a rational pace to avoid insupportable burdens on the consumer and the risk of major malinvestment the unwinding of which will be painful and embarrassing.’ According to RenewableUK, the numbers of small scale wind turbines and wind farms increased by 50 per cent last year, but projects have divided opinion with many communities fighting against the erection of turbines, considered to be a visual blight on the landscape. Just last week a 115ft, £250,000 wind turbine in Bradworthy, Devon was blown over by high winds. Experts believe the winds were so strong the blades span out of control causing the massive structure to catch fire and collapse. It was supposed to have a life expectancy of 25 years – but has lasted just three. The Government hopes that wind energy will play a vital part in Britain's 2020 target for energy from renewable sources, contributing up to 14 per cent of the total required energy which could power an equivalent of 7.7 million homes. A department spokesperson said: 'We . expect to need up to 13GW of onshore wind to help meet our 2020 . renewables targets. We currently have 5GW operational, 6GW consented, . and 7GW in planning. 'However, not everything in planning will be consented, and not everything consented will be built.'","Over 1,200 wind turbines are to become operational over the next 12 months .

Doreen James, from Worcestershire, fell in love with the white bear in a red jumper when she was a little girl. Now, 65 years after being given her first Rupert annual, she is the owner of what she believes is the UK's largest hoard. Lifelong passion: Doreen James in her special 'Rupert room' which houses her Rupert Bear memorabilia which she has built up over the last 40 years . Bear essentials: Doreen has scores of cuddly Rupert toys as well as some of his friends, including Bill Badger and Podgy Pig . Pile 'em high: A bookcase crammed with Rupert Bear annuals, the first of which she received from her parents when she was five years old . Doreen, a retired receptionist, has spent thousands over the years on her hobby, which contains everything from annuals to tins of Rupert pasta and chocolate wrappers from the 1970s. Her collection grew so large she was forced to give some of it away and has so many Rupert ornaments on display she has now given up dusting. After 40 years of packing away her ever-expanding collection in boxes, she decided to create a 'Rupert room' where everything from the curtains to the bedding and even the rugs are plastered with Nutwood's most famous son. Doreen, whose eccentric home was even used as a meeting point for Midlands members of the Rupert fan club - Followers of Rupert - for 14 years, said: 'I have always loved Rupert, but I never intended to start a collection. It just sort of happened. Trip down memory lane: The retired receptionist has dozens of ornaments featuring scenes from her favourite Rupert stories . Fanatic: Doreen's collection contains everything from tins of Rupert pasta and lemonade to jigsaw puzzles . 'My parents bought me my first Rupert annual when I was about five years old, and I got one for Christmas every year - it was always very exciting. 'I would spend hours reading them, I loved the stories. But as I got older, I stopped collecting and gave my annuals away. I thought I'd grown up, but I was obviously wrong. 'I was in my 20s when I came across an old annual in a toyshop one day, and I bought it for old times' sake. 'Once I'd re-read it, though, I wanted to replace all of my old collection - and I started trying to find all the old copies. 'I bought a new copy of the annual every year, too. But one day I saw a really unusual Rupert teddy, with porcelain hands, and I had to have him - and it spiralled from there.' The most expensive item in Doreen's . collection is an original 1936 Rupert annual - the first ever published - . which set her back an undisclosed four-figure sum.

Collection, collection, collection: Doreen has a huge 4ft-high Rupert taking pride of place on the bed and an entire bookshelf dedicated to Rupert annuals and story books . Rupert Bear was created as a comic strip by English artist Mary Tourtel and first appeared in the Daily Express newspaper on November 8, 1920 in a bid to win sales from the rival Daily Mail and Daily Mirror. He lives with his parents in a house in Nutwood, a fictional idyllic English village and is drawn wearing a red jumper and bright yellow checked trousers, with matching yellow scarf. Originally depicted as a brown bear, his colour soon changed to white to save on printing costs, though he remained brown on the covers of annuals. The success of the Rupert stories has led to the creation of several television series based on the character as well as a wide range of teddies and other products. And although most of the items in her collection cost just a few pounds each, she estimates she has spent thousands on the bear over the years. In her Rupert room, she has dozens of ornaments featuring scenes from her favourite Rupert stories, and scores of cuddly Rupert toys - as well a few cuddly friends - including his chum Bill Badger and Podgy Pig. The cupboards in the room are full to the brim of Nutwood-themed goodies and rare items - including tins of lemonade and hundreds of jigsaw puzzles. An entire bookshelf is dedicated to Rupert annuals and story books, with a huge four foot high Rupert taking pride of place on the bed. Doreen added: 'I had so many items that I was running out of space for them, even with my Rupert room. 'I gave a lot of my Rupert bath toys and other items to charity, so hopefully someone else can benefit from my collection.

'My friends don't think it's strange I have a Rupert room - they're used to my bear obsession by now. 'I buy new items whenever I can. The Followers of Rupert meet annually and there's always lots of new items that people bring along to swap or sell. 'I also find a lot of items at antiques fairs - I usually find bits and pieces at Bromsgrove antiques market. 'My favourite Rupert story was one I read when I was very young, where a Christmas tree came to life, and started walking around. 'For years, I would sit in our garden and stare at the trees, convinced that they really might grow legs of their own one day. 'Rupert has lasted so well through the ages because everyone can relate to him - grannys, mums and dads and children all love him.

Sentenced: Jill Marshall was jailed for 18 months for stealing £50,000 from Gulliver's Kingdom theme park in Derbyshire . A theme park cashier has been jailed after stealing £50,000 of takings - which she used to fund shopping sprees and lavish holidays. Jill Marshall, 54, stole the cash from Gulliver's Kingdom where she had worked in the ticket office for 20 years. Park bosses became suspicious when Marshall was caught with wads of cash in her handbag and her till did not add up. She was finally caught on CCTV not issuing a ticket to every customer and pocketing their entrance fee instead. Marshall was sentenced to 18 months in prison after pleading guilty to fraud by false representation at Derby Crown Court. She was also given six months to repay the money she stole. Sentencing her, Judge David Pugsley said: 'You have lived a useful, caring, kindly life but you stole in a position of trust and that sort of behaviour will not be tolerated.' The court heard how an 18 month-long investigation was launched by police and staff at the attraction in Matlock bath, Derbyshire, who painstakingly went through nine years of receipts. They found that Marshall, of Wirksworth, Derbyshire, had stolen £50,000 - the equivalent of 3,134 adult admissions at £15.95 - between 2004 and 2010. Justin Wigoder, prosecuting, said that Marshall was regarded as a 'trustworthy and reliable' employee by park bosses. But despite CCTV being installed in her office, Marshall still brazenly hid tickets behind the counter and pocketed money. He said: 'On one day, she took £600. The scope and scale of the theft can be seen as a broad picture.' He told the court she spent some of the money on a holiday in the Maldives and shopping trips to designer outlets in Cornwall. Trusted: Marshall had worked at Gulliver's Kingdom (pictured) for 20 years . Defending Marshall, Sonal Ahya said that she spent some of the cash on family gifts and that she is 'truly, truly sorry'. She added: 'She put herself in this position but has demonstrated a degree of regret by acknowledging guilt.' Detective Constable Kevin Rivington, from Derbyshire Police, said after the sentencing: 'The discovery of this fraud was understandably very upsetting for the family who run Gulliver's. 'Marshall had worked there for more than 20 years and was a respected, trusted and much-liked employee. 'The staff at Gulliver's have been very supportive of our investigation and have helped us at every opportunity. 'I hope this sentencing gives them some form of closure so they can move on.' The theme park describes itself as a family-run attraction for families with children aged between two and 13 years of age. The company also has attractions in Warrington, Cheshire, and Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire.","Jill Marshall worked at Gulliver's Kingdom in Derbyshire for 20 years .

If you look closely, you just about tell who is who – despite the decades that separate these pictures of Status Quo. Time, drugs and alcohol may have taken a toll, but the band’s original members are out to prove they can still rock as they reunite for a UK tour some 32 years after they last shared a stage together. Rick Parfitt admitted it had taken eight days of rehearsals for the band to gel, but they are now raring to go in spite of their combined age of 257. Ready to rock: From left - Rick Parfitt, Alan Lancaster, John Coghlan and Francis Rossi as they prepare to go on tour starting this Wednesday at Wembley Arena . As they were: From left - Rick Parfitt, John Coghlan, Alan Lancaster and Francis Rossi in the mid 70s in Malmo, Sweden . They can also count a total of nine wives and 17 children between them, and estimate they spent millions on drink and drugs during their days of rock ’n’ roll excess. The group, which has had 11 different band members over the past 51 years, was founded by South London schoolfriends Francis Rossi and Alan Lancaster in 1962. They were joined by Parfitt and John Coghlan, and went on to sell 120million albums. They have had 65 songs in the British charts – more than any other band – with hits including Rockin’ All Over the World and Down Down. The original line-up disbanded in 1981 when Coghlan walked out. Lancaster left in 1985. Parfitt and Rossi continued to tour as Status Quo, before the ‘Frantic Four’ agreed to reunite after meeting last year. The nine-date tour begins on Wednesday and will end at Wembley Arena on March 17. Here, we profile the rock ’n’ roll veterans: . Rick Parfitt, 64, OBE: . The guitarist thinks he has spent £1million on drugs over his career and once threw the contents of his dining room into a swimming pool while high on cocaine and alcohol. Married three times, he has had five children. Daughter Heidi from his first marriage drowned in the family pool when she was two. In 2006 he married third wife Lyndsay Whitburn and the couple now live in Spain with their five-year-old twins. Parfitt had a heart attack in 2011, has quit drugs, and only has the occasional bottle of wine. ‘I have a lovely and very relaxed life now,’ he says. Francis Rossi, 63, OBE: . He overcame a huge cocaine habit which he says lasted between 1979 and 1987 and was so bad it destroyed his nose. The guitarist, who has eight children from two marriages, lives in Surrey with second wife, Eileen, to whom he has been married for 24 years. He claims he spent almost £1,500 a week on cocaine during the 1980s and his daily regime consisted of two bottles of tequila, three grams of cocaine and ‘hundreds’ of cigarettes. Today he says he smokes ‘only five cigarettes a day’, takes homeopathic remedies and enjoys crosswords and clay pigeon shooting. He said: ‘As I’ve grown up, I realise I just want to stay alive. I get up at 7am and go to the gym five days a week now.’ The group, which has had 11 different . band members over the past 51 years, was founded by South London . schoolfriends Francis Rossi and Alan Lancaster in 1962 . Alan Lancaster, 64: . The bass player moved to Australia with his second wife Dayle at the height of Status Quo’s success to escape the drink and drug problems engulfing the band. The couple, who wed in 1976, have two grown-up children. He also has a son from his first marriage. He filed a lawsuit to stop Rossi and Parfitt from continuing to perform as Status Quo, which was settled out of court. He has worked as a music teacher, but  in 2000 suffered a reaction to his hair dye which affected his nervous system. He initially lost the use of his right leg, arm and hand, but has recovered. Of his 23 years with the band, he said: ‘We were wild and rebellious, but the drinking and drug taking did a lot of damage.’ John Coghlan, 66: . He was a mechanic in South London before joining the group as a drummer in 1963. He walked out in 1981 after kicking over his drum kit in a drunken rage. He says his biggest vice was alcohol, admitting: ‘I’d drink anything in those days.’ After leaving the band he moved to the Isle of Man to change his lifestyle. He formed John Coghlan’s Quo to perform Status Quo hits. He has a daughter from his first marriage and now lives in Oxfordshire with second wife Gillie. The pair married in 1982. He says: ‘The days of heavy drinking have gone. I’m 66 now, so I have to look after myself.’","It's been 32 years since they last played on stage together .

When Daniella Monteith came around after blacking out at Plaistow tube station she was initially worried that a family history of neurological illness had caught up with her. Her first thought was to see a doctor and get a check up. A week on from the black out in November 2011, still concerned about her family medical history, she called British Transport Police and asked them to review CCTV footage of her fall so that she had more details of what had happened. Scroll down for video . Justice: Daniella Monteith, left, said that she is glad that 'justice has been served' after Michael Ayoade, pictured in CCTV footage from his November 2012 attack on a teenager, was jailed for four years today . It was only when officers watched a video of what happened that teacher Daniella was made aware that she had been the victim of a random and savage attack. Unbeknown to Daniella, she had been viciously punched in the side of the head by Michael Ayoade in an unprovoked assault. Transport police said that they'd never seen anything like the incident before. Miss Monteith, who was a third year political science student at the time, had a broken tooth and pain and swelling in her jaw. But Daniella wasn't alone. A second 16-year-old girl was also knocked unconscious in an almost identical attack on the street outside the same station a year later. She was left with broken teeth and a split lip. After that assault police released CCTV footage of the shocking assault and Ayoade was arrested after a tip off from a member of the public who recognised his face on the clip. Brutal: As well as the attack on Daniella Monteith, Ayoade also attacked a 16-year-old girl in Plaistow. He is pictured on CCTV footage running up behind her . Vicious: Ayoade throws a punch at his 16-year-old victim outside Plaistow tube station . He later admitted the two attacks. Yesterday, cannabis smoking Ayoade was jailed for four years at Inner London Crown Court. Although he admitted two counts of Actual Bodily Harm, Ayoade originally told police his teenage victim had ‘started it’ by making him ‘feel like a pauper with her facial gestures.’ In interview, he told officers he could not cope with ‘taking an insult from a little person like that.’ Prosecutor Joel Smith told the court: 'What is most shocking about these offences is that they seem to flare up from nothing. 'He is a danger to the public and in particular women.' Miss Monteith, currently working as an English teacher in China, told the Evening Standard after the sentencing: 'It (the sentence) won't make me feel any safer going back to England, but I'm happy justice has been served.' Horrific: The 16-year-old, who cannot be named because of her age, is thrown to the ground following the assault . She added that she was lucky to be alive after the attack saying: People die from blows to the head all the time. 'Both myself and the other young lady are lucky to be alive.' It also emerged today that this is the third time the thug has been jailed for attacks on innocent members of the public. In October 2009 he received a 90 day sentence for an attack on a woman in the street after spitting on her shoe. When she said it was disgusting he followed her, demanded an apology then punched her in the face. And just two months later in December 2009 he was locked up for three months for punching a man in the face as he talked on his mobile phone. The court had heard that Ayoade, who smoked up to ten cannabis joints a day, told his victim afterwards: 'I’m sorry, that wasn’t meant for you.' When he was arrested he told police: 'Shut up p***** or I’ll punch you in the head.' Gillian Frost, defending Nigerian-born Ayoade, said her client accepted his behaviour was ‘shocking’ and added his use of cannabis could have possibly added to his attitude. Jailing him at Inner London Crown . Court Judge Roger Chapple said he was ‘deeply troubled’ by Ayoade’s lack . of explanation for his actions. In . police interview the thug told officers he had drunk a cup of vodka and . smoked three or four spliffs before carrying out the attack on the . teenage girl. He was . examined by medical experts but they were unable to find any mental . health problems. One doctor said he presented a ‘high risk to others and . particularly women.’ Injured: The girl was knocked unconscious in the shocking attack and left with broken teeth and a split lip . Stricken: Ayoade is seen running off at the top of the shot as his victim lies unconscious on the pavement in Plaistow, east London, following the attack . The judge agreed and told him: 'I am satisfied it is my job to do what I can to offer the public a measure of protection from you.” He said the CCTV images were worth ‘many thousands of words’ and captured ‘graphically the shocking violence of the attack.’ He told the defendant he was using his powers to increase the sentence to the maximum four years, as well as adding an extra year on to his licence period. He said: 'These are the sorts of attack which causes the public, on whose behalf I must sentence, an ever greater concern, a fear for their own safety when out, even during the hours of daylight. 'The sentence must be a deterrent to you and others. I must reflect that public concern for offences as violent as this and the public must be protected from you.'

A plane used by a gang of drug smugglers to bring nearly £2million of cocaine into the UK is being sold by police on eBay. Detectives seized the plane when they brought down an international smuggling ring in Northamptonshire last year. It will now be available to the highest bidder online with the sale money to be used by police to fight crime and set up community projects. For sale: Police are selling this microlight plane, seized from a gang of drug smugglers last year, for £12,000 on eBay . For sale: The plane was seized by officers from the East Midlands Special Operations Unit as it landed in Northamptonshire on a drugs run . But the plane, which officers say will need some work to be airworthy again, will come at a price. The Zenair Zodiac CH601 UL microlight has a reserve price of £12,000 on the online auction site. The plane was used by drugs traffickers to fly a shipment of cocaine from France to Northamptonshire last year. The class A drugs - which had a street value of £1.7 million pounds - had been driven from Amsterdam in the Netherlands to northern France before being loaded onto the aircraft and flown across the English Channel. But the gang were thwarted at the final hurdle when a team from the East Midlands Special Operations Unit was on hand to arrest the smugglers as they landed. Six British men, all from Corby, Northamptonshire, and London pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply Class A drugs in November last year and were jailed for a combined total of 37 years. Adam Simmonds, the Northamptonshire Police and Crime Commissioner, said: 'I believe this may be the first time a force in the country has seized an aeroplane and is in a position to sell it, so this is a great result for us.' Bidding on the plane end shortly after 8pm on March 4. Good cause: Proceeds from the online auction be used by police to fight crime and set up community projects . Out of action: The plane is listed on eBay as needing some work to be airworthy again after the wings had to be removed for storage . The microlight is listed as needing work to be done to it to make it airworthy because the wings were removed for storage purposes. Detective Inspector Greg Maides, from the East Midlands Special Operations Unit, said: 'It is relatively common to confiscate a criminal's car, but it's not often that we make an application to seize a plane so we can't really predict how the bidding is likely to go. 'That said, whoever does buy it will do so knowing that their money is being put to good use and that they have helped deprive these offenders of a valuable asset that they planned to use to carry out their crimes. Justice: The gang who were caught using the microlight have since been jailed for a combined total of 37 years . 'When a case such as this results in convictions at court and considerable prison sentences for the defendants, we do not see that as the end of the matter. 'We have the legislative powers to seize criminal assets to strip criminals of their possessions at every stage of the investigation.' The plane is not the only loot seized from criminals which the force currently has up for sale. A replica Second World War German BMW R70 motorbike and sidecar is on offer for £4,500 and a Breitling watch is on sale for £1,750.","The microlight was seized as smugglers landed in Northamptonshire .

It may look like a rusty wreck, but this ultra-rare Aston Martin will still set you back a pretty penny - and will cost a further £250,000 to restore to its former glory. For the 1949 Aston Martin Two-Litre Sports was just the fourth car built by the iconic British car company after it was bought by David Brown. The much-coveted car, which retrospectively became known as the DB1, is one of just 15 ever made and nine still in existence. In need of TLC: This Aston Martin Two-Litre Sports is on the market for almost £100,000 but will cost a further £250,000 to restore to its former glory . In demand: The car was one of just 15 made and one of eight or nine still in existence, so it is highly desirable despite its poor condition . Pricey: A DB1 in mint condition, like the one pictured, can sell for in excess of £400,000 . But it is in need of some tender loving care from a car enthusiast with plenty of spare cash to spend after three decades of decay. Specialist dealer Aston Workshop has the motor on the market for £99,950 in the hope that someone will snap it up with the intention of restoring it. Whoever takes on the project could end up making a tidy profit in the end however, with mint condition DB1s usually shifting for more than £400,000, with prices of classic Aston Martins rising in the current market. Clive Dickinson, general manager for Durham-based Aston Workshop, said: 'The chassis is good and it is a complete car but it is need of a serious restoration. 'The body looks quite bad but we don't think it will need to be replaced and it still has its original chassis and engine which is important. 'Any rare Aston Martin such as this model is desirable and values are really going up at the moment. 'About 90 per cent of all Aston Martins ever built still exist but we think there are just eight or nine of the 15 Two-Litres left and only two others we know about in the UK. Rare: The Aston Martin has been bought by a specialist dealer from its previous owner in Scotland where it was left decaying in a garage for three decades . New era: The car was just the fourth made after David Brown bought the iconic motor company in 1947 . Iconic: The car later became known as the DB1 with Brown's DB initials continuing to live on in the current Aston Martin range, with the firm currently building the DB9 . 'The past ten years has seen some prices appreciate by more than 600 per cent. The Aston is a really pretty car and it will look fantastic when restored. It was one of just 15 DB1s ever made, but what will you get for your £100,000: . 'The car will probably cost around £250,000 to restore and take between a year and 18 months.' David Brown took over the Aston Martin in 1947 with the Two-Litre Sports model the first car built under his management. It later became known as the DB1 with Brown's DB initials continuing to live on in the current Aston Martin range, with the firm currently building the DB9. As the original name suggests, the car is powered by a 2-litre engine which developed a modest 90bhp when it was new - giving the Aston a top speed of a mere 93mph. This is less than half the top speed a current Aston Martin is capable of but its impressive 24mpg makes it greener than all of the current range barring the Toyota-based Cygnet. The car's brochure states: 'The discriminating motorist will find every virtue he is likely to look for - beauty of styling, superb comfort, speed with safety and power to spare.' It adds: 'You will certainly be proud to own one; you could even be excused for boasting about it.' David Brown is understood to have opted against larger scale production of the car because he was underwhelmed by its performance, focusing the firm's resources onto the more powerful DB2. This particular model was the fourth 'DB1' to leave the firm's factory in Feltham, Middlesex and was delivered to Cyril Williams (Motors) Ltd in 1949 in its original livery of Alpine Blue with Grey Hide. The car was then chosen to represent Aston Martin at the Motor Show of that year where it was sold to another dealer, Brooklands Motors. Original: The body looks quite bad but dealers don't . think it will need to be replaced and it still has its original chassis . and engine . Underwhelming: David Brown is understood to have opted against larger scale production of the car because he was underwhelmed by its performance . A 'continuation' log book from 1963 shows it was moved to Scotland that year where it remained until Aston Workshop recently bought it. For the past 41 years it has had just one owner and has been kept off the road since 1983. Aston Workshop is calling the classic sports car one of the world's most exciting Aston Martin restoration projects. Mr Dickinson added: 'The DB1 was the last Aston Martin to have a four-cylinder engine with David Brown fitting the DB2 with a more powerful six-cylinder. 'It was capable of nearly 100mph when it was new so it was quite respectable at the time but this wasn't fast enough for David Brown.'","The Aston Martin Two-Litre Sports was one of just 15 made .

Thug: Timothy Hagar, 26, who has been jailed for six-and-a-half years at Teesside Crown Court after viciously attacking dad Sean Cole outside his home in Loftus, East Cleveland . A father was beaten up so badly by a thug after asking a drunken gang to move away from his home that he had to quit his job because of his injuries. Timothy Hagar attacked oil worker Sean Cole and stamped on his head with 'full force' as he lay unconscious outside his home in Loftus, North Yorkshire, in April last year. He kicked Mr Cole so hard that he had blood splatters on his right trainer and a piece of flesh embedded in the heel following the attack. He was too ill to work and had to give up his £4,000-a-month job. Mr Cole was so badly injured that his five-year-old daughter did not recognise him when he was released from hospital. Hagar, 26, was jailed for six-and-a-half years yesterday after admitting inflicting grevious bodily harm with intent at Teeside Crown Court. The court heard that offshore worker Mr Cole had stepped outside his home with his wife Louise and asked the group, which included Hagar, to move away from the house. But Hagar kicked the couple's dog in the head and then subjected Mr Cole to an 'appalling' attack, knocking him unconscious and kicking him in the head and chest. Mrs Cole feared that her 43-year-old husband was dead as she rushed to his aid and screamed for help as he lay motionless on the ground. He suffered a double jaw fracture and lost teeth in the attack, and still suffers from numbness down one side of his face, according to prosecutor David Crook. Mr Cole was so ill that he was forced to give up his job and moved his family to Scotland. But the family has since hit financial trouble and have been served with an eviction notice. In a victim statement read out to the court, Mr Cole said: 'I will never forgive the man for what he did. 'My own wife thought I was dead. She witnessed the attack. 'One thing that still upsets me is that the day I was released from hospital, I saw my children and tried to cuddle them. Sentence: Hagar was jailed for six-and-a-half years after admitting GBH with intent at Teeside Crown Court, pictured . 'My five-year-old daughter got scared and ran off. She did not believe I was her father because I didn’t look like him.' Hagar, a binge-drinking supermarket warehouse worker, was so drunk he could not remember the attack, but was said to be ashamed of his actions. When his mother saw the aftermath of the trouble, she said: 'If it’s my son who’s responsible, I’ll disown him', the court was told. Paul Newcombe, defending Hagar, said: 'He is at a loss to explain his behaviour. All he can venture is that he drank an enormous amount.' In a letter of apology to his victim, Hagar, of Redcar, North Yorkshire, said: 'I am sincerely sorry for what happened to you, and I am completely and utterly ashamed of myself.' Judge Simon Bourne-Arton, QC, told Hagar he had ruined Mr Cole’s life through 'seconds of gratuitous, mindless violence'. After Hagar was sentenced, Detective Constable Matthew Waterfield, from Cleveland Police, said: . 'This was an horrific incident and the victim has shown strength and courage throughout this investigation. 'We are pleased with the sentence which reflects the true nature of the danger that Timothy Hagar poses. 'This should spell a warning for anyone thinking of taking part in alcohol-fuelled violence.'

A pair of fraudsters conned investors in their sham company out of £200,000 by wining and dining them in expensive restaurants and creating a fake luxury lifestyle. Michael Taylor, 46, took people to plush restaurants in sports cars and promised them that if they pumped money into his firm: 'All this could be yours'. Along with his accomplice Joanne Marston, 31, Taylor promised investors huge profits in return for buying into Tenretni - internet spelt backwards. One of the pair's victims went bankrupt after re-mortgaging his home to invest. Fraudsters: Michael Taylor and Joanne Marston created a fake luxury lifestyle hiring expensive cars, including Mercedes and Porsches, to lure investors to pump money into their sham business (file picture) Taylor was jailed for 32 months at Swansea Crown Court after pleading guilty to conspiracy to defraud while Marston was sentenced to a two year suspended sentence and ordered to do 180 hours of community service. The court heard how the pair leased a Porsche, two Mercedes and other sports cars as a front for their fraud. Taylor's company Tenretni sold websites and training packages for an online marketing scheme and promised investors huge returns on commission from online companies. But it never delivered on that promise. An investigation by Carmarthenshire Council found the pair had defrauded their victims out of £197,500 but the money was spent on hotels, restaurants and the leased cars. Prosecutor Andrew Davies said: 'They targeted potential investors, including elderly people with a retirement funds. Scam: Taylor and Marston offered huge financial returns to people who invested in Tenretni - internet spelt backwards . 'They lured them to South Wales were they were shown a luxury lifestyle with the promise that they could achieve the same. 'They would take them out to dinner to convince them to become investors in the business.' Mother-of-three Marston was originally one of Taylor's victims but went into business with him after becoming 'infatuated' with the conman. Mr Davies added: 'Despite her background and knowing the difficulties it could lead to, in the early months of 2008, she became part of the company.' Ian Wright, defending Marston, said her marriage had failed because of her involvement with Taylor. Sentenced: Taylor was jailed for 32 months while Marston was handed a suspended sentence for her role in the scam . Her ex husband was in court and had provided a 'substantial sum as compensation' for the victims. Sentencing the pair, Judge Huw Davies said: 'A significant number of people lost everything that they put in. 'As you knew, many of these people could not really afford the investment. 'There were investors who were so desperately worried about the consequences that they became ill, chronically ill. 'There were investors who lost a cherished family home and investors who borrowed in order to invest at a cost they simply could not sustain and are carrying ever increasing costs as a result.

Investigation: West Yorkshire Police confirmed that further inquiries are being made to gain a 'better understanding' of the relationship between officers and Jimmy Savile, pictured . Detectives are looking into claims that on-duty police officers went to weekly 'breakfast clubs' at the penthouse flat of paedophile Jimmy Savile. West Yorkshire Police are quizzing officers over the so-called 'Friday Morning Club' where Savile served up coffee and cake. The police force had said in October that it had no information regarding officers visiting Savile's flat in Leeds, West Yorkshire, but added that they were 'free to do what they wished when off-duty'. But a spokesman has confirmed that further inquiries are being made to gain a 'better understanding' of the relationship between officers and the shamed former DJ. Police are said to have attended while being encouraged to play a more active role in the community. But the spokesman said that there is no evidence of any wrongdoing by force employees past or present. He said: 'Local officers working in the community were invited by Savile to his home for a coffee. 'At that time the force was encouraging community officers to interact more with residents in their area. The officers usually visited on a Friday. 'It was usual for other friends of Savile to be present drinking coffee and chatting. He added: 'If any issues come to light which warrant further scrutiny, we will investigate fully.' Savile invited guests to his house for coffee and cake on a Friday morning for around two decades. Serving and retired officers are said to have regularly attended including retired Inspector Mick Starkey and Sergeant Matthew Appleyard, who currently works in neighbourhood policing in Weatherby, North Yorkshire. Host: Savile, pictured after receiving his knighthood in 1990, hosted the Friday Morning Club for 20 years . In an authorised biography of Savile, his friend Howard Silverman, who was another regular guest, was quoted as saying: 'I can't really reveal what we spoke about at the FMC... but we certainly put the world to rights and had a blooming good laugh.' There is no suggestion that members of Savile's 'club' knew of the presenter's catalogue of sexual abuse. Enquiries by West Yorkshire Police are unrelated to the Metropolitan Police's Operation Yewtree investigation into hundreds of allegations made against Savile, said to be one of Britain's most prolific sexual offenders. The probe is also separate from a investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission into allegations that an unnamed police officer acted on behalf of Savile in a 2009 Surrey Police inquiry.

Tragic: Schoolboy Shane Jeavons was killed when he played a game of chicken on a busy road after drinking with friends . A teenager was hit by a car and killed after playing a drunken game of chicken on a busy road. Shane Jeavons, 14, had been drinking lager with friends in a park before he was knocked down in September last year, an inquest has heard. The schoolboy, who suffered from an eye condition but was not wearing his glasses at the time of the incident, was fatally injured when he sprinted into the road in Solihull, West Midlands. He was taken to Heartlands Hospital in Birmingham but later died. The court heard that Shane, a pupil at Lode Heath Secondary School, had been drinking with friends in Hermitage Park in the town and decided to play chicken on the road as the group left the park at around 9.45pm. West Midlands Police Detective Constable Amy Walker told the inquest Shane's friends told her he was 'drunk' when they left the park. Asked by the coroner to recount what she was told by Shane's friends, Det Con Walker said: 'He was running from one side of the road to another on his own while the cars were coming. 'He ran around a tree and didn't look when he ran across the road.' Blood tests revealed that Shane was over the drink drive limit when he was injured. Driver Jermaine Willmott was travelling below the 30mph speed limit but had been unable to avoid hitting Shane. He told Birmingham Coroner's Court: 'All of a sudden a shadow came from my right and, boom, something hit my car. Deadly game: The teenager is said to have 'sprinted' into this busy road by crash investigators . 'I pulled over, got out and saw the situation I was in. I just remember a girl asking me to call his dad. 'I said: ""No, we need to call an ambulance"".' Crash investigator PC Mark Weaver said it appeared Shane had left his friends on the pavement, 'sprinted' across the road and was returning to the group when he was hit by Mr Willmott's car. When asked about youngsters playing 'chicken', PC Weaver said: 'I have heard of the game and, sadly, have dealt with some deaths, with the last one being in 2012. Tributes: Flowers were left at the scene, right, where Shane Jeavons, left, was fatally injured in September last year . 'The majority of people who play this game are children.'

A man accused of beating his pregnant ex girlfriend to death just days before she was due to give birth has told of his addiction to strong alcohol and a computer game. Tony McLernon, who allegedly killed Eystna Blunnie in Harlow in Essex in June last year, told a murder trial that at the time of the murder he was drinking more than 20 litres of cider and Lambrini mixed together each day. The 24-year-old told Chelmsford Crown Court that he would rarely leave his bedroom, instead playing Guitar Hero on his Xbox console for hours at a time. Brutal: The body of pregnant Eystna Blunnie, pictured, was found dying on the side of a road in Harlow . On trial: Tony McLernon is accused of killing Eystna Blunnie and her unborn child in Harlow last year . He said that his drinking and gaming habits put strain on his relationship with Miss Blunnie. Mr McLernon is accused of luring Miss Blunnie to meet him in a street two days before she was due to give birth by telling her in a text message 'Got a surprise for you, hope you like it'. When she arrived, prosecutors say that he kicked her and their unborn child to death. He said: 'I was very good at the game and was invited to take part in national competitions online. 'But I played it far too much and she began to not like it. 'One night I heard a bang upstairs and went up to find my Guitar Hero guitar had been snapped in half and the only person in the bedroom was Eystna.' Unemployed McLernon told the court that his drinking began at the age of 16. For several years he had met friends in a park near his Harlow home and would drink up to 12 pints of lager most nights, he said. Investigation: Police outside the home of Tony McLernon last year . Distraught: People lay flowers on the side of a main road in Harlow near to where Eystna Blunnie and her unborn baby were brutally beaten to death . Grief: Two friends console each other beside tributes to the college student who was due to give birth . As his alcoholism, funded by Jobseeker’s Allowance, worsened, he sought out cheaper and stronger drinks. He said: 'A group of us would meet by a bench and drink. I would normally have about 12 pints of lager. 'But in 2012 my drinking changed significantly. 'I would buy two or three litre bottles of strong cider from the supermarket and mix it with Lambrini to make a drink with 13 per cent alcohol. 'We called it rocket fuel. 'By the middle of the year I was drinking a mix of 10 or 11 bottles per day. 'I would be sick, vomiting everywhere, falling out of bed and at times the ambulance would have to be called.' McLernon denies murdering Miss Blunnie, 20, and a charge of child destruction by wilfully causing the death of an unborn child. He told the court how he had found Miss Blunnie fatally injured in the street. He said how he had met Eystna Blunnie by a bench in Harlow on the night she died. But as they talked two men appeared and started an argument with her.. Once the men left, McLernon said he gave Miss Blunnie a kiss goodbye and went home. Tragic: More friends of Eystna Blunnie, lay floral tributes at the scene. They have also written messages of condolence on Facebook . 'As I was walking I heard a scream and thought somebody was being attacked,' he said. 'I ran back to see if that person was okay and saw two people jumping up and down. 'I saw the two men run off up a path and, when I saw Eystna injured in the street, I nearly screamed.' He said he tried to put his former partner in the recovery position. 'There was more blood than I care to remember and she made a horrible sound,' McLernon added. 'I tried to turn my phone on but it took a while to load up. There wasn't anything I could do. 'I saw one of the men running back towards me so I panicked and I ran. 'I was in no fit state to try to defend her - the look in his eyes was terrible and I thought he was going to give me a kicking.' He added that he had not been able to tell anybody about what happened that night because 'it made me feel sick'. Shocking: A mourner reads some of the touching messages left at the spot where Miss Blunnie was found . Miss Blunnie, a catering student and barmaid, was due to give birth to a girl within days when she died. She told McLernon she was pregnant with his child in October 2011 but they broke up the following year. He said that he had been 'over the moon' about the impending birth and that the pair had been getting on well. Asked if the text message was part of a . scheme to tempt her to meet him, he said 'absolutely not' adding the . surprise was that he had brought his dog, Alan, to see her. McLernon, who said he had suffered . from depression and was prone to self-harm, denied claims he had . physically abused her and previous partners. In the days leading up to Miss Blunnie’s death, McLernon had told friends and relatives she was trying to ruin his new relationship. He claimed she was prone to aggressive outbursts and told the court she would verbally abuse him in the street but he 'never raised a hand to her'. On one occasion she threw a china cup at him and on another she bit his chest, McLernon said. The case continues.

Allegations: Alison Smith, pictured, has vowed to make a formal complaint against Lord Rennard . A former Liberal Democrat activist is one of 'several women' believed to have called a police hotline about the party's former chief executive Lord Rennard. University lecturer Alison Smith claims to have suffered an incident 'more serious than having a hand placed on her knee' in 2007. Ms Smith said in a statement: 'I can confirm that I have just spoken to the confidential police hotline regarding Lord Rennard.' Meanwhile, it was claimed by Sky News that several women' had contacted the hotline. Ms Smith added: 'The Police are very keen to deal with the matter discreetly, and I agree it is important that other people coming forward should be able to do so without fear of being caught up in the current media storm. 'In addition, it is important that the allegations against Lord Rennard are now dealt with through formal processes.' Ms Smith said she decided to 'blow the whistle' about the peer's alleged behaviour because he had started to become involved again in training events. 'We were told he was not going to make a comeback, now here he is, turning up all over the place,' she told BBC News. Ms Smith, then a party activist but now an Oxford University politics lecturer, told how she and a fellow female Lib Dem member were invited back to Lord Rennard’s house after having dinner with him in central London six years ago. She also revealed the ‘Kafkaesque’ nightmare she experienced when trying to report the incident to Lib Dem high command. Describing the alleged sexual impropriety, Ms Smith said: ‘At first everything seemed fine. He was on one sofa and we were on another sofa. Denial: Lord Rennard has insisted that the claims made against him are untrue . ‘And then he just very suddenly got up and plonked himself between us  and started moving his hands down our backs and places where they had  absolutely no business being. It was both of us at the same time. ‘I straight away stood up and said: “No, that’s not acceptable. I’m going home”.’ Miss Smith claimed he tried to tell her there were no taxis, but said she got ‘very, very, very cross’ and insisted on leaving. ‘He looked surprised, he looked shocked and he opened the door and we got a taxi home.’ But Ms Smith said that when she tried to report him she faced numerous obstacles. She explained: ‘You have to remember that Chris Rennard was chief executive and director of campaigns. The guy who is the problem is at the top of the tree.’ Lord Rennard, who stepped down as chief executive on health grounds, has said he is ready to 'co-operate with any properly-constituted inquiry' into allegations of inappropriate behaviour. The peer has issued a series of strenuous denials of any wrongdoing. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg's handling of the affair has been repeatedly called into question. An initial response from the party suggested that he was not aware of the allegations but the party leader later admitted he had known of general concerns. He conceded yesterday that his party made 'very serious mistakes' in failing to deal properly with complaints made about the peer. And during a visit to the Aston Martin car factory in Warwickshire today, he told reporters that he wanted the investigations into Lord Rennard's alleged behaviour carried out ‘as quickly as possible’. 'Mistakes': Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg conceded on his radio phone-in yesterday that his party made 'very serious mistakes' in its handling of the Lord Rennard scandal . ‘The key thing, not least for the . women involved, is that the investigations get their work done as . quickly as possible,’ he said. ‘The important thing is that the two . investigations I announced last week are allowed to get on with their . work, and that the police investigation is allowed to get on with its . work. ‘It's crucial we get to the bottom of the truth and do that as soon as possible. That's why the investigations should proceed as quickly as possible.’ Scotland Yard has met senior Liberal Democrats to investigate whether any criminal activity has taken place and the party has launched two internal inquiries. Both Scotland Yard and the Lib Dem party refused to comment on whether more women had come forward to make allegations against the peer. A Lib Dem spokesman said this morning: We're not going to give a running commentary on who has spoken to who or how many people, all the details will come out in an inquiry in due course.' The Metropolitan Police said they were ‘not prepared to discuss’ claims that officers are poised to interview a number of women, who are said to have called a dedicated hotline, in the next few days.","Alison Smith says she has spoken to detectives about her allegations .

A police chief has been forced to apologise after sending an 'inappropriate' and 'insensitive' accusing families of those killed in the Hillsborough disaster of lying. David Crompton, Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police, issued a full apology over the email which was sent just before a report was published in September criticising police handling of the incident which saw 96 Liverpool fans die at Sheffield Wednesday's stadium in 1989. The email discussed the launch of a website featuring South Yorkshire Police's version of its handling of the disaster. Mr Crompton mentions republishing past apologies from force Chief Constables and keeping the site 'purely factual'. It was sent to Assistant Chief Constable Andy Holt and the force head of corporate communications Mark Thompson. It read: One thing is certain - the Hillsborough Campaign for justice will be doing their version... in fact their version of certain events has become 'the truth' even though it isn't!!

A top Sixties model is suing makers of the hit TV show Mad Men for using her image without consent in the opening credits, it emerged today. The stunning image of Gita Hall May, well-known for her eye-catching red hair, is seen projected on a skyscraper in the Emmy-winning show's iconic opening credits. During the show's title music a silhouette of an 'ad man' is seen falling among the Manhattan skyline with famous adverts shown all around him. May's image is included and comes from an advert she did for Revlon hairspray in the 1950s. Scroll down for video . Controversy: Gita Hall May is suing Lionsgate for this image in the opening credits of Mad Men. The sequence shows an image of the model, pictured, she claims was used without her consent . Top model: Gita Hall May, pictured, was a popular 1950s and 1960s model. She claims Mad Men used her image to give the show credibility and she is entitled to damages as a result . In a complaint filed to Los Angeles Superior Court on Friday, showbiz website Deadline reports, Hall May. 79, claimed Mad Men studio Lionsgate failed to request her permission to use the image shot by famous fashion photographer Richard Avedon. 'I wished they had had the courtesy to get in touch with me,” she told ABC News on Monday. 'I was surprised because nobody had checked with me about it– they must have thought I was dead.' She says the now well-known opening sequence put together by design firm Imaginary Forces helped the drama, starring January Jones and John Hamm, become a success. 'At no time did she agree to allow, forty years later, her image to be cropped from the photo, in secret, and inserted as a key element in the title sequence of a cable television series, without her consent and for commercial purposes,' her complaint says. 'The Main Titles were integral to the success of Mad Men'. Upset: Hall said on a morning show that no one tried to get in touch with her and she assumes they thought she must be dead . Award-winner: Mad Men which first appeared on screens in 2007 has been both critically acclaimed and popular among the public. It follows central character Don Draper, pictured .

It goes on to point out the titles themselves won an Emmy and the show's producers have made in excess of $1billion as a result of the series' success. May says she only became aware of the use of her image last May despite it appearing in the credits since the show's pilot in 2007. She claims the show used her image to give the series credibility. 'Defendants sought to include the likeness of a famous celebrity from the 1950s in the credits in order to promote and burnish the image of the show in the eyes of the public and to create the 'feel' of the program that was critical to its commercial success... Defendants sought Plaintiff's image because she was among the top models of her day,' the lawsuit says. Lionsgate were unavailable to comment on the legal action which seeks unspecified damages.

The mother of rock chick Jo Wood has revealed how as a teenager she stole the heart of Nelson Mandela. Rachel Lundell was 16 when she won a pledge of undying love from South Africa’s future president, who at the time was living in a tiny village in Umtata in the Eastern Cape. Rachel, now 78 and living in Devon, had just finished convent school in 1951. She was working in her aunt’s fruit store and cafe after having second thoughts about life as a nun. A young Nelson Mandela penned a love letter to Rachel Lundell in 1951 when she was 16 . She had first been offered a job at a . baker’s shop in nearby Mount Frere but was sacked before she had even . started when the owner discovered that Desmond, the black delivery boy, . was her brother. Rachel . said: ‘Desmond was darker than me; I was blonde, freckled and white. My . father was white and my mother looked white but her grandmother was . black and she passed those genes on to us in varying degrees.’ Desperate . for work, Rachel was then offered a job by her aunt, Gertie Morrison. But it was Gertie who put paid to any chance of romance with Mandela in . apartheid-era South Africa. Rachel . explained: ‘We had a lot of black customers and he was no different, . buying cigarettes and peanuts in quite large amounts. ‘There . was no frisson of excitement when he came in or anything like that. He . certainly wasn’t what you would call handsome but he had a twinkle in . his eye. Rachel Lundell, second right, pictured with daughter Jo Wood, Rolling Stone Ronnie Wood, left, and husband Mike . ‘One day he came in and I served him as usual but after he left, I noticed there was a letter on the counter addressed to me. I opened it and there was yards and yards of it. ‘It started off lovey-dovey enough but before long it had turned into something of a political missive all about how he was going to free the blacks in our country. Not very romantic really. ‘Then Gertie came in and saw me reading the letter. She asked who it was from and I told her. 'She snatched it out of my hands and threw it on the fire, saying I wasn’t going to be going out with any black men.’ Rachel never saw Mandela again. Soon . afterwards, he moved for good from Umtata, now called Mthatha, a former . military post for colonial forces, to Johannesburg where he continued . his political struggle. Rachel Lundell aged 16, when Nelson Mandela pledged his undying love . She continued: ‘I wish I still had the letter. ‘Imagine what it might have told us . today about how Mandela predicted what lay ahead for him and his . country. It would have been a special piece of history. ‘All I’ve got left are the memories . and the endless jokes from my eventual husband and children about what . might have been. I know he was a bit of a ladies’ man in later life and . it would seem he might have been then, too.’ Little . did Rachel know at the time that Mandela was already married to Evelyn . Ntoko Mase, with whom he had three children: Thembekile, Makaziwe, who . died aged just nine months, and Makgatho, born in 1951 – the year of the . love note. That same year, Mandela was elected president of the African National Congress Youth League and by April 1952 was spearheading the so-called Campaign of Defiance. He became the first black president of South Africa in 1994, standing down five years later. In November 1952, Rachel set sail herself for a new life in England on a Dutch cruise ship with a passport and ticket arranged for her by a missionary. Her destination was suburban Surbiton, South-West London, where she lived with her sister Joan. About a year after arriving, she was gardening at the front of the house when a local boy, Michael Karslake, strolled past and persuaded her to go to the cinema instead of the square dance she had planned. Rachel said: ‘I was all dressed up in my check shirt and denim trousers but something told me to go. I was supposed to be going off travelling in Europe and he had a job lined up in Canada. ‘We never looked back, though. We married in 1954 and I’m proud to say I found the right one for me. Mike gave me four lovely children, the first of whom was Josephine.’ Jo, now 57, was famously married to Rolling Stone Ronnie Wood for 26 years and has just published a new memoir – Hey Jo. Eventually, Mike and Rachel retired to Devon. Mike died in 1990, leaving Rachel with just four cats for company. Rachel said: ‘I still talk to him and only the other day his picture floated down off the shelf.  I knew it meant he was still with me.’","Rachel Lundell, mother of Jo Wood,was 16 when Mandela pledged his love .

Yelp users will now not only know where to get the best dim sum, but how clean the establishment is. The user review site has announced today that it is adding restaurant’s health-inspection grades to its site, giving discerning users yet another filter through which they can decide where to eat. For now, the service is available in San Francisco, and New York City will be added within the next few weeks with plans to expand to Philadelphia, Boston, and Chicago. By the code: Yelp is now including health scores in its reviews, located below the restaurants' address . Details: By clicking on the score, Yelp users can see how many violations the restaurant has and when they occurred . The health departments of New York have assigned letter grades – A, B, C, or fail – for dining establishments in these cities. For San Francisco businesses, the new program displays restaurant health scores – for example, 92 out of 100. Anything above 90 points gets a ‘good’ rating, meaning there are low health risks. Anywhere from 86-90 is considered adequate, 71-85 needs improvement, and anything less than 70 is poor. Points are taken away for violations and are given in accordance to the severity of the violation. Clicking on the number takes users to a page with more detailed information about the restaurant's recent inspections. The company, which is itself based in San Francisco, says its engineers have been working with the cities in designing technology that lets municipalities publish inspection information on its website. It means, especially in San Francisco where restaurants are not required to visibly post the findings of health reports, that there will be more transparency between the health department, the city’s restaurants, and consumer choice. In plain sight: New York City restaurants must prominently display their grade from the Department of Health, ranging from A, B, C, or grade pending . Grading system: In New York, restaurants are awarded an A, B, C, or fail grade; grade pending means that the restaurant initially received a B or a C but has been given a limited amount of time to improve . Nobu, 105 Hudson Street – A . Katz’s Delicatessen, 205 E. Houston St. – A . Mr Chow, 324 E. 57th St – A . Guy’s American Kitchen & Bar, 220 W. 44th St., A . Magnolia Bakery, 401 Bleecker St., A . The Health Department of New York has required that letter grades be posted since July 2010. It inspects around 24,000 restaurants a year to make sure each establishment complies with health codes. All New York restaurants must post the Department of Health grades on the outside of their establishments. The code itself looks at things such as how the food is handled, the temperature at which it is served, the hygiene of the restaurant’s employees, maintenance, and vermin control. Restaurants are given two chances to earn an A – if they are not given an ‘A’ at the initial inspection, they are given around a month to improve. Yelp’s Chief Executive Officer Jeremy Stoppelman said that the measures will have ‘a good impact on society,’ according to Bloomberg. ‘In the weeks ahead, we hope to have all of San Francisco’s restaurants online. We’ll then begin migrating New York data online as well.’ A study from UC Berkeley showed that higher Yelp ratings, even by half a star, made a restaurant more likely to have a full house for dinner.","Service currently available in San Francisco and coming to New York in next few weeks .

A new recruit to the Fire and Rescue service has been dubbed 'Fireman Ham' - because he's a 14 stone pig. Dominic the pig has been recruited by fire chiefs to help fire fighters train how to handle escaped animals. The 200lb pig has already helped train dozens of fire fighters how to save escaped animals, and soon, almost every fire fighter in Avon Fire and Rescue will have had 'escapology lessons' with Dominic. Scroll down for video . New recruit: Fire fighters - from left to right are Jed Allen, Andre Harvey, Steve Hartshorne, Fred Le Ouedec, Steve Quinton, Duncan Forrester, Mark Barrett - are being taught about escapology by Dominic the pig . Cunning: Dominic the pig was taken in by a rescue centre after his elderly owner died but now helps firefighters train to deal with animals on the loose after they discovered his love of escaping . Surrounded: Fire fighters from Avon Fire and Rescue Service are well prepared as Dominic attempts to get around them . The Kune Kune pig was rescued almost 12 months ago after his elderly owner died, and he was taken to animal rescue centre Horse World, in Bristol. But it wasn't long before the 18-month-old piglet - who is still growing - became known at the sanctuary for his friendly, but cheeky nature. And after several escape attempts, his carers realised he would be the perfect candidate to teach fire fighters how to handle escaped animals without startling or harming them. Cheeky: Dominic weighs 200lb - the equivalent of 14 stone - and can prove to be quite a handful . Fire officers are regularly trained at the centre by expert staff, but over the last six months, trainers have introduced a practical element into the training - herding Dominic safely around the farm. But the cheeky pig makes sure the task is not as easy as it sounds - and after a day of chasing hefty Dominic around a muddy sty, the crews are more than well-equipped to deal with runaway farm animals. Animal safety lecturer Dawn Watkins, who runs the course, said: 'Dominic is a very friendly animal, he loves human attention and likes to be the centre of attention. 'However, he also loves to run off exploring whenever he can, so he was the ideal candidate to help train these fire crews. 'A lot of the fire fighters have never had any contact with animals before, and have no idea how to handle them, or read their body language. 'They told us that rescuing stuck or trapped animals, or catching escaped animals who have made their way onto roads, is a major part of their job, and the animal training is a big help for them. 'The course with Dominic lasts a day, and they start in the classroom, before progressing out to the stables to deal with Dominic face-to-face. 'They usually start the day not-to-keen on the pig - but by the end of the training, he's everyone's best friend. It's impossible not to love him.' On the run: Dominic the pig keeps fire fighters busy during a practice drill at the animal rescue centre Horse World in Bristol . Learning new skills: Fire fighters from Avon Fire and Rescue Service attend the rescue centre to learn how to deal with escaped farm animals . Firefighters use blankets and boards to help create a walkway for the escaped animal - but as they quickly discover, not all animals want to go quietly - and Dominic regularly escapes from the walkway, leaving fire fighters to catch him once again. Horse World worker Jess Savage said: 'Dominic is great for helping fire fighters realise how difficult it can be to control animals, but hopefully, they leave the training with a better understanding of animals and how to handle them. 'Dominic loves the attention and his new role - he gets a lot of fuss and attention.' On the trot: Fire fighters use large wooden planks to heard Dominic where they want him to go . Full of surprises: Dominic has proven the perfect candidate to teach the fire fighters how hard it can be to control farm animals .","The 200lb - 14 stone - pig was taken to a rescue centre after his owner died .

All children taken to accident and emergency units will have their details put through a computer database designed to identify those who may be victims of abuse, ministers said yesterday. The £9million system will be designed to find children whose visits to casualty are not their first. It will also identify children who are living in state care or whose families are under the supervision of social workers. The Child Protection – Information System, which follows two failed attempts to combat child abuse by storing information in computer databases, will save lives by identifying abused or vulnerable children, claim ministers. Children taken to accident and emergency departments will have their details logged on a national database in a bid to crackdown on child abuse . But MPs and civil liberties groups . warned that innocent families could find themselves cast under suspicion . by the system and that misuse of its information could lead to children . being wrongly taken into care. The database, announced by health . minister Dan Poulter, will link NHS records of A&E visits with . registers held by local council children’s services departments when it . goes into operation in 2015. Dr Poulter said: ‘Doctors and nurses are often the first people to see children who are victims of abuse. ‘Up until now, it has been hard for . frontline healthcare professionals to know if a child is already listed . as being at risk or if children have been repeatedly seen in different . emergency departments or urgent care centres with suspicious injuries or . complaints, which may indicate abuse. ‘Providing instant access to that . information means vulnerable and abused children will be identified much . more quickly – which will save lives.’ The scheme has won support from medical professionals and charities. Dr Simon Eccles, an A&E . consultant at Homerton University Hospital, London, who helped plan the . system, said: ‘It is quite straightforward, I hope, most of the time, to . ascertain whether this is just a child who is beautifully looked after . but tends to play rough, or this is a child who is not ever being . watched when they play and tend to hurt themselves.’ He told BBC Radio 4’s Today Programme . that medical staff could take a case ‘up the ladder’ if they believed a . child was at risk. ‘This database is not trying to solve . the entire problem but simply adding another layer of information that . previously was hard to get,’ Dr Eccles added. But critics warned that parents could . face suspicion if hospital staff use the database wrongly or bring in . social workers too quickly. Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming, a . campaigner against the abuse of social work powers, said: ‘We have to be . very careful not to require parents to prove their innocence. ‘There are cases where there is clear . evidence that parents are not guilty of abuse but it is ignored. It . does nobody any good to take the wrong children into care.’ Mr Hemming added: ‘We need to encourage people to go to A&E departments when their children are hurt, not to put them off. ‘We don’t need a situation where if you take your child to A&E three times, the child goes into care. ‘Hospitals already use information wrongly and I am worried about the way information on the new system may be used.’ Nick Pickles, of civil liberties . group Big Brother Watch, said: ‘Parents need reassuring that a . ham-fisted approach to databases – sadly something the NHS is well known . for – will not end up with information about children on the desks of . over-zealous social workers. ‘The Government needs to clarify . urgently that the only children who will see any change as a result of . this system will be those who are already registered as at risk.’ Last year, more than 4.5million young people aged 19 and under attended A&E – a rise of 4.7 per cent on the previous year. The number of patients of all ages . going to casualty has surged by 50 per cent to more than 21million in . the past decade – partly due to an increase in population and a loss of . public faith in out-of-hours GP services.","Every emergency visit to hospital will be linked up by NHS computer system .

The drummer for country music star Kellie Pickler was in serious condition on Sunday as one of five people hospitalized in two crashes where six others died. The collisions happened within minutes at the same spot on Interstate 65 in central Kentucky. Pickler's manager Larry Fitzgerald said 36-year-old Gregg Lohman of Goodlettsville, Tennessee, suffered serious injuries in the wreck on Saturday. He remained in serious condition at University of Louisville Hospital. Scroll down for video . Injuries: Gregg Lohman, 36, was hurt during two collisions on the same stretch of road in central Kentucky on Saturday where six others died . Fiery crash: A couple, their elderly friend and three children died after their SUV was hit by tractor-trailer . Kentucky State Police Master Trooper Norm Chaffins said Lohman, who also works as a music instructor at Tennessee State University, had head and neck injuries after a four-vehicle wreck in the southbound lanes. It happened about 15 minutes after a fiery crash involving a tractor-trailer and an SUV on the northbound side of the highway. On her Facebook page, Pickler said Lohman wasn't just a drummer, 'he is family'. 'I believe in the miracles and the power of prayer, so it would mean the world to me, my band and Gregg's family if you would please keep him in your prayers,' Pickler wrote. 'Thank y'all so much.' Six people from rural Wisconsin were killed when a tractor-trailer rear-ended their Ford Expedition at about 11.13am (EST) on Saturday in the northbound lanes near Glendale, Kentucky. The victims were 62-year-old driver James Gollnow and his wife, 62-year-old Barbara Gollnow; 92-year-old friend Marion Champnise; 18-year-old Sarina Gollnow, relationship unknown; and foster children ten-year-old Gabriel Zumig and eight-year-old Soledad Smith. Tragedy: The family were returning home from a vacation in Florida when the accident happened . Two other foster children survived and were taken to area hospitals. Police identified them as Hope Hoth, 15, who was transported to a hospital in Lexington with burns and a broken spine; and Aidian Ejnik, 12, who was taken to Kosair Children's Hospital in Louisville with cuts to the back of his head. Barb Gollnow of Shawano, Wisconsin, the sister-in-law of those killed, called the collision 'a horrible tragedy,' but said details about her family's trip that led them through the Bluegrass State would have to come from the surviving children in the family. State Police said the family was returning to Wisconsin from a vacation in Orlando, Florida. Chaffins said the tractor-trailer was following too closely to the SUV to stop before the collision. The Expedition was 'totally engulfed in flames. It was totally destroyed by the fire,"" he said. 'It's just a charred mess'. Distracted driving is among the causes being investigated. 'That's one of the points we're looking into,' Chaffins said. 'We haven't pinpointed the exact cause.' Chaffins said despite snow flurries, weather was not a factor in Saturday's crashes. The driver was identified as 47-year-old Ibrahim Fetic of Troy, Michigan. Police were looking at his driving logs and collected a blood sample. Fiery crash: Emergency personnel work at the scene of a multi-vehicle wreck on Interstate 65 near the 82 mile marker, which killed six members of the same family . The National Transportation Safety . Board did not immediately have a comment about whether they were . investigating. Chaffins expects the board to become involved. The two crashes shut down the busy stretch of highway for about five hours. Chaffins said police were investigating whether rubbernecking was the cause of the wrecks in the southbound lanes. In . that wreck, the Freightliner driven by 58-year-old Mark Bowser from . Lewisburg, Ohio, struck Lohman's vehicle, then hit a 2005 Saturn SUV . driven by 53-year-old Victor Martinka of Glenview, Illinois. Chaffins . said Martinka's vehicle then struck a 2012 Chevrolet SUV driven by . Stephanie Yates, 55, of Louisville. Chaffins said none of the other . drivers were hospitalized. The . wreck on Saturday happened just north of where a tractor-trailer . crossed the median and struck a van carrying 11 people in 2010. In the . wake of that crash, the NTSB called for a ban on talking on cellphones . or texting by long-distance truckers. The . truck driver is ‘telling us that he saw the vehicle that was in front . of him and he hit the brakes and he didn't hit them in time,’ Master . Trooper Norman Chaffins added. Tragic aftermath: A burned Ford Expedition sits on a rollback ready to be moved from the crash scene after a tractor-trailer rear ended the SUV, causing it to burst into flames . The driver of the tractor-trailer was . not injured and was co-operating with police, Chaffins said. ‘He's . obviously pretty torn up about everything.’ The southbound crash involved a . tractor-trailor and three other vehicles. Police were investigating . whether rubbernecking was the cause. ‘That's what we're suspecting, that . people were looking at the crash that happened on the other side and . became distracted and caused a chain-reaction crash,’ he said.

Up to 15 gold miners in Australia have reportedly been sacked after they performed global dance craze the Harlem Shake and posted it online. The men, who worked on six-figure salaries at the Agnew Gold Mine in Western Australia, made the video last week in a dripping underground vault surrounded by heavy machinery. It begins as all Harlem Shake videos do, with one mask-wearing member dancing alone, before the film cuts to a group of 15 burly men - many topless - gyrating wildly to the beats of DJ Baauer's viral hit of the same name. Scroll down for video. Harlem Shake: The clip begins as all Harlem Shake videos do, with one mask-wearing member dancing alone . At one point, a miner performs the 'caterpillar' dance move in a muddy puddle as his colleagues cavort around him brandishing orange cones and poles. But Barminco, the firm which owns the mine, unceremoniously relieved the men of their duties for breaching the companies 'core values of safety, integrity and excellence', according to a dismissal letter seen by newspaper The Western Australian. One of the sacked workers, who would not be named, accused Barminco . of being too heavy-handed, telling the paper the tradesmen were simply 'having a . bit of fun'.

Breach of values: But Barminco, the firm which owns the mine, unceremoniously relieved the men of their duties for breaching the companies 'core values of safety, integrity and excellence' The letter stated that the workers have now not only been barred from the Agnew mine, but have been blacklisted by Barminco 'at any site domestically and globally'. The sacked Australian miners are not the first 'Harlem Shakers' to land themselves in hot water for performing the rambunctious dance routine and posting it online. On Friday, dozens of students were charged with violating the Egypt’s decency laws after they danced in their underwear to the song outside the headquarters of the north African nation's Islamist President Mohammed Morsi in a light-hearted political protest (pictured). A few days earlier, Tunisia’s Education Minister threatened to expel students and sack teachers at a school in the country's capital after they created a version of the meme. Also last week a group of American college students were placed under federal investigation after they organised a performance on a Frontier Airlines flight from Denver to San Diego. It is yet unclear what will happen to them or the air stewards who helped them rally passengers via the on-board intercom to take part. Earlier this month University of Alabama freshman Nojan Radfar was facing expulsion for his attempt to create the largest Harlem Shake video ever by gathering hundreds of students on a central part of campus to stage the dance. A Facebook page has since been set up in defence of the miners, sparking furious online debate. 'An . underground mine is no place for cowboys, clowns or fools. It’s an . inherently dangerous place to work and workers are entitled to expect . those working alongside them to respect the risks and abide by rules and . regulations,' wrote Greg Harris on Facebook. But Stacey Hughes replied: 'Miners work their asses off for up to 4 weeks at a time, away from . their family!! A bit of fun to pass the time and they get sacked.' According to the firm's website, the Agnew Goldmine produces over 160,000 ounces of gold a year. It says most low-level workmen typically operate on an eight-days on six-days off rotation, while more senior employees spend seven days below ground before a seven-day furlough. As well as its mines in Australia, the company also has pits in Mali, Ghana and Egypt. Up to 4,000 videos of ""Harlem Shake"" variations are uploaded on the Internet daily. The concept is simple -  the videos are about 30 seconds long and set to Harlem Shake by New York DJ Baauer. Each clip typically begins with one person gently bopping alone for the first 15 seconds while everyone else in the room ignores them. Then the bass line drops and everyone goes wild, doing crazy dance moves around the room. The song belongs to the trap genre of music and every video has put a different twist on the dance routine. Many . of the performers wear facemasks or helmets, strange costumes and fancy . dress - there is commonly someone dancing in their underwear.

They are allowed to use the public passage by authorities in the Ukrainian capital because they cannot afford to pay for a venue. Scroll down for video . The gathering for pensioners has taken place every Saturday for about 20 years in an underpass near a city centre metro station .

Now, he has returned with his camera to tell their story - and one couple in particular caught his eye. Nikolai Milevsky, born in 1938, and Natalya Stolyarchuk, born in 1955, met at the dances and have since moved in together - one of about twenty couples who have formed out of the gatherings. Garanich went to their home, which they have shared for four years, and photographed them getting ready for their weekly appointment with the makeshift ballroom.

The death toll from a suspected suicide bombing in Pakistan's commercial capital Karachi on Sunday has risen to 45, a senior city official said. Hashim Raza also said 149 people were wounded in the attack outside a Shi'ite mosque, the latest signal that Sunni groups are escalating sectarian bombings against the minority. The bomb exploded outside a Shi'ite mosque as people were leaving evening prayers, said police official Azhar Iqbal. Men, women and children were among those killed and wounded, he said. The attack killed 145 people after a bomb exploded outside a Shiite mosque as people left evening prayers . No one has yet claimed responsibility for the bomb, but it signals an escalation in attacks targeted at the Shiite minority . Witness Mariam Bibi said: 'It's like doomsday to me. I was watching television when I heard an explosion and my flat was badly shaken. 'I saw people burning to death and crying with pain. I saw children lying in pools of their own blood and women running around shouting for their children and loved ones.' Another witness, Ali Reza, said: 'The explosion was so massive it jolted the entire area. Two flats and nearby shops caught fire after the explosion and balconies of various buildings collapsed.' It is feared people have become trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed in the bombing. No . one has claimed responsibility, but Sunni militants linked to al-Qaeda . and the Taliban have targeted Shi'ites in the past, claiming they are . heretics. Initial reports . suggest the bomb was rigged to a motorcycle, although a survey of the . damage indicates there could have been additional explosives planted at . the scene, the police official said. Rescuers attempt to save victims from the burning wreckage after a bomb exploded outside a Shiite mosque . It is not yet known which group is responsible for the explosion, which caused flames to engulf the building . Injured victims are carried away from the scene of the attack where 45 people died and 149 were wounded . 'I heard a huge blast. I saw flames,' Syed Irfat Ali, a resident of the area, said, adding that people were . crying and running to safety. Sunni . militant groups have stepped up attacks in the past year against Shi'ite . Muslims who make up about 20 per cent of Pakistan's population of 180 . million people. Two brazen . attacks against a Shi'ite Hazara community in south western city of . Quetta have killed nearly 200 people since January 10. Pakistani . militant group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi claimed responsibility for those . bombings, which ripped through a billiard club and a market in areas . populated by Hazaras, which are mostly Muslim Shi'ites. Onlookers clear the way for injured victims to be rescued from the rubble at the scene of the attack in Karachi . It is feared many more victims are trapped in the rubble of the building which collapsed after the explosion . Pakistan's . intelligence agencies helped nurture Sunni militant groups like . Lashkar-e-Jhangvi in the 1980s and 1990s to counter a perceived threat . from neighboring Iran, which is mostly Shiite. Pakistan banned Lashkar-e-Jhangvi in 2001, but the group continues to attack Shi'ites. According . to Human Rights Watch, more than 400 Shi'ites were killed last year in . targeted attacks across the country, the worst year on record for . anti-Shi'ite violence in Pakistan. The human rights group said more than 125 were killed in Baluchistan province. Most of them belonged to the Hazara community. Human rights groups have accused the government of not doing enough to protect Shi'ites. After . the January 10 bombing, the Hazara community held protests, which . spread to other parts of the country. The protesters refused to bury . their dead for several days while demanding a military-led crackdown . against the Lashkar-e-Jhanvi group. Rescuers will continue to search through rubble for victims who may be trapped under the collapsed building . Chaos unfolds after the bomb attack as the death toll of Shiites killed since January totals nearly 350 . Pakistan's president dismissed the provincial government and assigned a governor to run Baluchistan province. No operation was launched against the militant group until another bombing in February killed 89 people. The government then ordered a police operation and has said some members of the group have been arrested. One of the founders of the group, Malik Ishaq, was among those detained and officials said he could be questioned to determine if his group is linked to the latest violence against Shi'ites.","Bomb exploded as Shi'ite muslims were leaving evening prayers .

Words cannot describe how the family are feeling with this loss, for . such a caring person and for anyone that knew her or had any contact . with her, would know how she was always willing to help and chat to . anyone. 'We have been so overwhelmed with messages of support in such a . difficult time and we know how shocked people must be in hearing this . sad news and still it doesn't seem quite real. Speaking outside the three-storey property yesterday, where a police forensic van was parked outside, a family member said: 'It's a very hard time for us at the moment.' Police say they are not looking for anyone else in connection with what they called an ‘isolated and tragic incident’. Mr . Dowling, a divorced father of two, had recently returned from a . month-long holiday to Australia on his own, according to a neighbour. He was described as a friendly ‘gentle giant’ by acquaintances who said . they were mystified as to what lay behind the deaths on an estate in . Devizes, Wiltshire. Former police inspector Bill Dowling and his partner were found dead at the house having suffered apparent gunshot wounds . A neighbour of Mr Dowling, who wished to remain unnamed, said: 'Vicky was lovely. They both were. 'I don't know what must have happened - they always seemed so happy whenever I saw them.' Neighbours . on the 50-property cul-de-sac yesterday described their shock, with one . recalling how Mr Dowling had an interest in shooting pheasants. The . neighbour, who asked not to be named, said he believed Mr Dowling had a . firearms licence. He said: . ‘I have known him for more than a decade and he was into shooting. I’d . seen him load what looked like a big gun case into his car a few times. I . think he went pheasant shooting. ‘It was a big gun – it looked like it . could have been a shotgun. He had long had an interest in shooting but . over the last couple of months I saw him in his shooting gear a lot . more.’ Another neighbour . said: ‘I heard screams and then what I thought was a door slam. It must . have been shots. We went to check on them and the porch was spattered in . blood.’ Detective Chief . Inspector Ian Saunders from Wiltshire Police, where Mr Dowling worked . for 30 years before retiring six years ago, said officers were alerted . by neighbours who spotted the bodies. He added: ‘Exactly what led to . this tragic incident is still being investigated.’ A . weapon was recovered from the scene, but police would not confirm the . type of firearm or whether Mr Dowling was a registered gun owner. Wiltshire Police say they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths . Yesterday the youngest of Mr Dowling’s sons, James, 31, was too upset to comment. But . from his home, less than half a mile away from the shooting, he said: . ‘I can confirm we have suffered a sudden death in the family. We are . obviously grieving and we don’t want to say anything further at this . time.’ Officers were keeping . guard at the entrance to Mr Dowling’s house, while forensic experts . worked beneath a tent positioned at the front of the end-of-terrace . property. The police cordon also enclosed a Skoda Fabia vRS hatchback . parked outside. Neighbour . Sandra Nairn, 55, said of Mr Dowling: ‘He was lovely. We used to chat . all the time. He’d always say hello – he said hello to everybody. ‘I . don’t know very much about Vicky, I just used to chat to her to say . hello. They’d been together quite a while and seemed happy enough . together. I last saw them last week and they were all smiles.’ Another . neighbour, Shirley Carr, 52, said she heard a commotion at around . 8.40am on Saturday. She said: ‘I heard the initial first bang, now I . know it was a shot, it was so loud. ‘Then, no more than five minutes later, another two quieter bangs came. There were three in total.’ A . friend of Mr Dowling said: ‘I’ve known Bill for 18 years. He was a . great guy. He was going out with a woman called Vicky, but they didn’t . live together. She was in her early 50s, blonde and pretty attractive. She used to come and go. They seemed quite a happy couple. ‘He was a gentle giant. He was over six foot tall and was well known in the community.’ Mr Dowling was a station commander at Marlborough police station for nearly five years. He left that role in 2004 and became a force operations room inspector in the control room in Devizes.","Police were called to the house on the Moonrakers estate in Devizes .

Just weeks after denying she was under any pressure to start a family, Zara Phillips looked more than a little broody as she played with her two-year-old niece over the weekend. The 31-year-old royal was seen laughing uproariously at the Beaufort Hunt Point-to-Point races in Gloucestershire on Saturday while swinging her brother's child Savannah around in the spring sunshine. Zara was joined at the event by her mother Princess Anne and her former England rugby star husband Mike Tindall, to watch their horse run in the 3 o'clock race. Feeling broody? Zara Phillips smiles as she swings her niece Savannah around at the weekend . Having fun: Savannah giggles as her aunt holds her tight on a lovely sunny day over the weekend . Her brother Peter Phillips, his . wife Autumn Phillips and their two children, the Queen's . great-granddaughters Savannah and Isla, who will be one on March 29, also clearly enjoyed themselves. But disappointingly 'Fiddle Faddle', which is owned by HRH the Princess Royal . and trained by Zara, pulled up mid-race and did not . complete the course. However, the star of London 2012, where she gained a silver medal for Team GB in eventing, didn't look bothered as she had fun with Savannah, carrying her around and throwing her into the air. Family: Zara speaks to her brother Peter as Savannah points and smiles at her daddy on Saturday . Support: Her husband Mike Tindall (left) brought the family dog as he joined his wife, Princess Anne (right) and the rest of their family at the Gloucestershire point-to-point . Disappointment: Princess Anne and Zara's horse 'Fiddle Faddle' pulled up during the 3 o'clock race . Only last month Zara insisted she feels no pressure to measure up to the Duchess . of Cambridge, saying she and husband have no immediate plans to start a family. Kate Middleton is expecting her first child with husband Prince William in July. 'Before we got married, everyone was like: “When are you going to get . married?” Then as soon as we were, it was: “When are you having kids?” ' Zara said. 'In the future we'll see what happens, but we're not, sort of, putting a date down.' Kate 'can win that one', she added. Family: The Princess Royal, Zara Phillips and her husband Mike Tindall were left disappointed when their horse failed to complete its race . Zara and Mike  have recently sold their £1.2 million Georgian mansion in Cheltenham, and are living back on the Gatcombe Park Estate with her mother and brother. They sold their white stucco marital home earlier this month in order to live there, which had been quietly on the market for 'some time' before it was snapped up by Shaun Wills, finance director of clothing company Superdry. Their new house, on the estate of the Princess Royal, already stables Zara's horses and is where she trains both racehorses and her three-day eventers. Happy couple: Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall in Holyrood Abbey, Scotland, on their wedding day in July 2011 but they are yet to have any children . The couple bought their detached house, which is on a main road but set back in its own grounds, before their wedding at Canongate Kirk, on Edinburgh's Royal Mile . Despite buying their Cheltenham home shortly after their wedding, in July 2011, Zara has always kept the home she previously lived in on her mother's estate. And moving back home will make the estate even more of a family affair - with Zara's brother Peter, his wife Autumn and their two daughters, also living there. The house and farming estate were bought by Queen Elizabeth II in 1976 for her daughter and the husband Captain Mark Phillips. Now the Princess Royal lives in the large manor house with her second husband, Sir Timothy Laurence, while Mark lives in the adjoining Aston Farm with his second wife.","The royal was seen having great fun with Savannah, two, on Saturday ."

A puppy that was found dumped in the street after all of her hair fell out has been given a wardrobe of jumpers to protect her sensitive skin. Peaches was just nine-weeks-old when she was abandoned in the street suffering from a painful skin condition, which caused her to bleed when she tried to relieve herself by scratching. But after being rescued by Animal Care in Lancaster, members of the public have taken pity on Staffordshire Bull Terrier Peaches, and provided her with a wardrobe full of jumpers, hoodies and towels to help her on a speedy road to recovery. Peaches suffers from a painful skin condition and has been given a wardrobe of clothes to protect her from the elements . Peaches was rescued by Animal Care in Lancaster and is on the road to recovery . Diane Lambert, centre manager at Animal Care, said: 'Peaches has got a bigger wardrobe than me! 'She's a big fan of her pink hoodie, she's becoming quite a doll.' When Peaches was found, she was so neglected that her nails were falling out. After being left by her owners, she was forced to roam the streets and scour for food to survive. Members of the public have taken pity on Peaches, and are donating clothes for her to wear until she recovers . It is thought she was left due to her skin condition, which is caused by a mite, which gets into the skin and causes extreme irritation. Diane said: 'We believe Peaches was born into a litter which contracted the disease. 'It's likely the owners were left with a mother and a litter of puppies who all had the skin condition, and rather than simply treating them, they let the animals get to this horrendous state, before dumping at least one of them. 'If she had not been rescued when she did, it's likely Peaches wouldn't have survived. It's an extremely painful condition, especially for a puppy. 'It's so sad because if her owner had just taken her to a vet when she first picked up the condition, it could have been treated so easily. 'I have been here 15 years and I have never seen a case as serious as this.' Peaches was first picked up by Homeless Hounds in Blackburn, where she was due to be put down until Animal Care rescued her. Taking her straight into isolation to prevent other dogs picking up the contagious disease, staff at Animal Care began to nurse her back to health by bathing her skin with a specialist shampoo. 'She is being treated with tablets and we have to bathe her everyday,' Diane said. 'We must wash her with a shampoo which costs £60 a bottle, but it means her hair should grow back within a month. She has a wardrobe of jumpers and hoodies, including a red Liverpool Football Club jersey . If she hadn't been found when she was, it is likely Peaches would have died from her condition . 'We then have to pat her dry with a towel to ensure we don't irritate her skin any further.' Due to her tender loving care, Peaches is well on the road to recovery and loving her new life. Diane said: 'Given everything she has been through, she is so trusting of us. 'When she came in she looked so miserable but her personality is starting to come out now and she's beginning to behave like a puppy - it's hard to stop her bouncing around! 'The public have been so kind - they have so far donated more than £700 as well jumpers, toys and treats for Peaches.' Peaches still requires further treatment including having her skin scraped to allow her condition to completely clear up. She will then be taken in by a foster home to 'learn how to be a dog', before being permanently homed. Animal Care has set up a Just Giving page for Peaches, where people can donate to help get her back on her feet, here.","Peaches the Staffordshire Bull Terrier was found abandoned in Blackburn .

"By . Suzannah Hills . PUBLISHED: . 04:44 EST, 4 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:57 EST, 5 March 2013 . The toyboy lover of a married secretary jailed after conning her bosses out of hundreds of thousands of pounds has told how she showered him with designer clothes and promised him a Lamborghini for his 21st birthday. Helen Hart, 46, who swindled more than £300,000 from the firm in Cornwall to fund a lavish lifestyle of five star hotels and private jets, 'dazzled' student Adam Cope, then 20, with shopping sprees in Harrods and tickets to international rugby games. After spotting the sports student in a gym in Truro and contacting him on Facebook, the conwoman told Mr Cope she was the heir to a multi-million pound gangland fortune, and showed up to their first date driving a Porsche. 'Dazzled': Married Helen Hart, 46, left, lavished thousands on her then 20-year-old lover Adam Cope, right . 'I was just dazzled,' he told the Sun. 'It was private planes, posh hotels, mansions and shopping, like the £3,000 she spent on clothes for me in Harrods. 'Who at my age wouldn't hook up with a rich, gorgeous older woman?' Mr Cope said Hart bought him expensive gifts including a £1,400 Breitling watch, an iPad, an iMac computer and a £700 iguana skin belt, and that the couple spent the night together for the first time at London's opulent Dorchester Hotel. Hart, who earned a modest £20,000 a year in her role as company secretary at PDP Green Consulting Ltd in Truro, even whisked the student and his friends to see a rugby international in Cardiff on a private jet - all funded by her fraud. But Mr Cope grew suspicious when some of Hart's promised gifts - including a Lamborghini sports car - failed to materialise. He had begun to distance himself from his older lover when police arrested him in September 2011, before releasing him when they realised he too had been taken in by Hart's scam. Mr Cope returned the gifts to police and jetted to Australia to work in a copper mine, and has said he now wants to forget about his 'fantasist' ex. Guilty: Helen Hart, pictured left, admitted used money from the company owned by Philip Desmonde, pictured right with his wife Susanne, to pay her rent, water and Marks & Spencer shopping bills, as well as £2,000 on a kitchen and £5,000 on 48 bottles of wine . Offices: The money was taken from PDP Green Consulting (pictured), an architecture and civil engineering firm run based in Truro, Cornwall, where Hart worked as company secretary, the court heard . Victims: PDP Green Consulting Ltd boss Philip Desmonde, who ran the company Helen Hart stole from, and his wife Susanne arrive at the Truro Crown Court to see her sentenced . The missing money was first discovered when . the accounts of Cornish engineering firm PDP Green Consulting were wiped out - leaving . it facing an unpaid £271,000 tax bill in May 2011. Hart was accused of stealing more than £380,000 from the firm between October 2005 and May 2011, but she disputed the amount of money stolen - claiming she had merely embezzled £190,000. But a court heard on Friday that there was a financial loss to the firm of £325,000 through Hart's fraud, deception and theft. The 46-year-old forged official court documents, solicitors' letters and the signature of the firm's company director Philip Desmonde in an effort to secure finance and back up claims of her wealth. The secretary ran up astonishing bills . including £5,990 for a return trip to Paris, £7,816 on a hotel stay in . Devon, and £4,752 on tickets and hospitality for a Premier League . football match. She also spent £31,368 on renovation work at her home. She was sentenced to four years in prison on Friday after previously admitting 25 separate charges spanning the period between October 2005 and May 2012. Passing sentence, Judge . John Neligan told Hart: 'These . frauds - that is what they are - were committed over six and a half . years, while you were an employee in a senior and trusted position. 'You used the company money to fund a . lavish lifestyle, you used the company money to fund expensive luxurious . cars, in all about £65,000 one way or another was spent on cars.' Hart admitted using the company’s . cash to pay her rent and water bills, as well as spending £2,000 on a . kitchen, £4,985 on 48 bottles of wine and an undisclosed sum on shopping . at Marks and Spencer. She also confessed to spending the firm’s money on luxury cars including a Porsche Boxster and a Range Rover.  Hart spent another £46,500 on a Mercedes, using money kept in her Coutts bank account. Luxurious location: Hart spent £7,800 on staying at the posh Bovey Castle hotel in Dartmoor, Devon . PDP Green Consulting Ltd boss Mr Desmonde and his family have claimed Hart spent much of the money trying to look and dress like his wife Susanne 'to push her out of his life'. Hart is accused of visiting the same hair salon, wearing the same clothes and even hiring the same fitness instructor as Susanne - echoing the plot of the 1992 movie Single White Female. She told her boss she inherited the fortune from a gangland uncle who was pals with the Kray Twins. At an earlier hearing Hart, of Illogan, Cornwall, admitted siphoning off cash to pay her £600-a-month rent and bills for four years. Jailed: Hart, 46, was sentenced to four years in jail for the scam . In March 2007 she ran up a hotel bill of £8,000 at Bovey Castle, a luxury hotel and golf course in Dartmoor National Park where rooms cost up to £689 a night. Roger Green, managing director of PDP Green, has said the firm was left disappointed by Hart's sentence. He said at the time: 'We are of course very pleased with the outcome of this case, although we feel the severity of Mrs Hart's crimes warranted a longer sentence. 'She has defrauded the company over a long period of time, abusing the trust placed in her by the directors of the company and her work colleagues and has shown no remorse for her actions.' Another victim was the charity Ella's Memory - founded by Martyn and Emmillie Selley in honour of their second child, who was stillborn in December 2009. Married Hart offered the charity £10,000 in November 2010, claiming to have had a child who suffered a cot death, but the cheque bounced. She also promised to sponsor Truro Rugby Club after meeting one of its players, claiming she was a multi-millionairess with £10 million inheritance to spend. Detective Constable Nick Stidwill said: 'She drove luxury cars and dressed well giving the appearance of having money, all based on a fantasy that she had inherited enormous wealth. But the reality was PDP Green was funding it.'

A lonely Australian widow who travelled half way across the world to find love has been found dead in suspicious circumstances in a rented villa in South Africa. Family members had urged 67-year-old Jette Jacobs, from Wagin, West Australia, not to fly to Johannesburg to be with a Nigerian man she was having a relationship with on the internet. She had already sent at least £50,000 to her Nigerian on-line lover, calling himself Jesse Orowo Omokoh, after meeting him on a dating website four years ago. Lost lovers: Jette Jacobs, who had travelled to South Africa from her home in Wagin, 150 miles south east of Perth, had lost her husband in 2002 and her subsequent partner in 2009 . Two years ago Miss Jacobs travelled to South Africa to meet Omokoh and spent some time with him without incident. She vowed to return to Johannesburg to be with him again. But now on that second visit her body has been found in her rented South African villa – and her money, credit cards, jewellery, laptop computer and other personal items have vanished. As she planned her second trip, police in Western Australia sent Miss Jacobs a letter that she might be the victim of fraud – but the letter arrived at her home shortly after she had left Australia. ‘The circumstances of Miss Jacobs’ death are still being investigated, but there is evidence that it is suspicious,’ said Detective Senior Sergeant Dom Blackshaw of West Australia’s Major Fraud Squad. Online lover: Miss Jacobs had already sent at least £50,000 to her Nigerian on-line lover, calling himself Jesse Orowo Omokoh, after meeting him on a dating website four years ago . Miss Jacobs’ son, who did not want to be named, told Sydney’s Daily Telegraph that her family and friends had tried to talk her out of making her second trip to meet the Nigerian, but she could not be dissuaded. ‘Mum went over for a couple of months and did not return,’ he said. Urging others who ‘find love’ on the internet to be cautious, he added: ‘As you can see, one consequence of the internet scammers has taken her life.’ Miss Jacobs’ son said people who find what they think is love on the internet should not follow through with it. ‘Don’t go, because at the end of the day they are running a business or a scam or what they want to believe it is, to lure people to go to Africa…there’s a possibility it’s a one way ticket and no return. ‘If you do meet someone who is truly in love with you, money doesn’t buy it.’ Miss Jacobs, who had travelled to South Africa from her home in Wagin, 150 miles south east of Perth, had lost her husband in 2002 and her subsequent partner in 2009. She was looking forward to meeting Omokoh again, but she received a message from him saying he could not get a visa to join her immediately. Detective Blackshaw said there was evidence that Omokoh had arrived in Johannesburg two days before reporting her death and giving a statement to local police. West Australian police run a warning website about relationship fraud that urges people not to respond to out-of-the-blue social media messages from strangers requesting romance, such as a friend request on Facebook. Lured to her death? Miss Jacobs' family had urged her not to fly to Johannesburg (pictured) to be with Omokoh after meeting him on a dating website four years ago . Other warnings include: . Be wary of overseas-based singles, especially if they confess their love for you after a short amount of time or want to know about your financial status. Remember that just because someone shares personal photos does not mean the pictures are of them - scammers often steal other people’s photos. Alarm bells should ring if someone you do not know personally requests money, particularly by a wire transfer service…which could be going to an account set up with a stolen identity.","Jette Jacobs, 67, from Wagin, Australia, flew to Johannesburg last month .

Tom Cruise may be the world's most famous Scientologist, but before he became a Hollywood megastar his religious beliefs were different, it emerged today. The future actor was in fact a devout Catholic who even planned to become a priest and studied at a seminary. But he was thrown out of the strict religious school after stealing liquor from the monks who ran the institution, according to his best friend from the time. Mr Cruise, who was born Thomas Cruise Mapother IV, had a troubled upbringing thanks to his abusive father. He seems to have sought solace in the Roman Catholic Church, and was persuaded to apply to St Francis Seminary School in Cincinnati, Ohio by Father Ric Schneider, according to the Daily News. 'Tom was instantly hooked,' the priest said. 'I think he wanted a good education. With his parents going through a divorce, it was tough on him, that's maybe one of the reasons why he came here.' The teenager just scraped his way into the seminary in 1976, scoring 110 on an IQ test - the minimum result needed for entry. Once he was there, he was not considered an outstanding student - but he did show signs of promise in the craft which would make him one of the world's biggest celebrities. School: The St Francis Seminary in Cincinnati, Ohio where Mr Cruise was a student for two years . Mr Cruise was a leading member of the drama club, which saw him 'come out of his shell' as he enthusiastically participated in competitions with other institutions, according to a friend. The priest who ran the society apparently identified Mr Cruise as a top student and gave him whole plays to memorise. His best friend from the seminary, Shane Dempler, told the Daily News that the pair were extremely devout and both planned to become priests. 'He had a very strong Catholic faith,' he said. 'We went to Mass, spent time in the chapel and enjoyed hearing stories from the priests. 'We thought the priests had a great lifestyle and we were really interested in priesthood.' Nonetheless, the boys still broke the rules, and would frequently break out of school to smoke or drink alcohol, Mr Dempler claims. Today: Mr Cruise is now one of the world's most recognisable celebrities thanks to his acting career . The incident that led to the pair being asked to leave St Francis came in 1977, when Mr Cruise and Mr Dempler supposedly decided to take advantage of the fact that the monks were having a party. Mr Dempler says he snuck in to the room where liqour for the party was being held, and threw it out of the window to his friend. The miscreants were apparently found out when some of the other students were caught by the priests obviously drunk, and forced to reveal where they had obtained alcohol. The seminary wrote to their parents asking them to withdraw their sons from the schools, according to Mr Dempler - which seems to have been the end for Mr Cruise's religious ambitions. Faith: The actor with his then wife Katie Holmes, who adopted his Scientology beliefs after their marriage . Controversial: The U.S.-based church has attracted support from many high-profile Hollywood celebrities . Later in life the actor converted to Scientology, which is known to be particularly popular in Hollywood. He is believed to be one of the church's most powerful officials, and has been a prominent public advocate of the controversial faith.

Lorraine Bayless, an 87-year-old woman who was being cared for at the Glenwood Gardens retirement facility died after a nurse at the facility refused to perform CPR on her . This is the elderly woman who passed at her California retirement home after one of its nurses refused to give her CPR. The 87-year-old woman, identified as Lorraine Bayless, collapsed in the dining room of the Bakersfield, California facility on Tuesday. Though a nurse quickly called 911, she refused to give the woman CPR, citing it was against company policy. Ms Bayless was later pronounced dead at a nearby hospital. 'Is there anybody that's willing to help this lady and not let her die,' dispatcher Tracey Halvorson asked on a dramatic seven-minute 911 tape released by the Bakersfield Fire Department. 'Not at this time,' said the nurse, who didn't give her full name and said facility policy prevented her from giving the woman medical help. It was later revealed that Ms Bayless . had signed a Do Not Resuscitate form, and it is against the policy of . the retirement home to give CPR to residents against their wishes. The executive director at Glenwood, Jeffrey Toomer, said in a statement: ‘In the event of a health emergency at this independent living community, our practice is to immediately call emergency medical personnel for assistance and wait with the individual needing attention until such personnel arrives. ‘This is the protocol we followed,’ he said, adding that there would be an internal review of the incident .

Halvorson even requested the nurse to pass the phone to anyone else in the room – another senior citizen, or a gardener.

A council is tied into a contract where it will have to pay out an 'astonishing' £2,000 every time a highways contractor plants a sapling on a roadside. Taxpayers will foot the bill for the sky-high sum every time private company Amey digs a hole and plants the trees on pavements, verges or central reservations in Birmingham. The extravagant cost to the public purse has been criticised for coming at a time when public services are being squeezed across the country with cuts being made to vital services. 'Astonishing' cost': Council highways contractor Amey is charging £2,000 for each sapling planted on roadsides in Birmingham . Contracted company: Amey has a £2.7billion contract to upgrade and maintain Birmingham's highway network until 2035 . Robert Oxley, Campaign Manager, of the TaxPayers' Alliance said: 'This is an astonishing amount to pay just for planting roadside trees. 'Given the bill, residents could be forgiven for thinking their street should look like the Champs-Elysées after contractors have visited their road. 'Contracting out services has to represent value for taxpayers' money, so poorly negotiated contracts should be axed to ensure that taxpayers' cash is being spent wisely.' The saplings can be bought direct for as . little as £20 from garden centres - a hundredth of the cost being charged . by highways contractor Amey. Costly: A planted sapling in Birmingham city where the council is facing £100million of cuts . The costly charge has been blasted as 'reprehensible' by councillors at Birmingham City Council, which is facing £100million of cuts. Chairwoman of the council's transport and sustainability committee Victoria Quinn was stunned by the Amey tree fees. The Labour councillor said: 'I have to say I find this charge ridiculous. It is reprehensible that, in 2013 during a time of austerity, we are being asked to pay this much for a natural resource.' Her colleague Phil Davis added that a local tree planting scheme would blow an entire community budget - leaving no money for anything else. But Amey, which has the £2.7billion contract to upgrade and maintain Birmingham's highway network until 2035, said that the cost was justified. Contract manager Eddie Fellows said: 'It cannot be compared to placing a tree in a park. The highway is a hostile environment for a tree. 'Particular species need to be selected, then there are ground works and the impact on utilities to be considered. 'The work is carried out on an active highway, then there are accidents and vandalism.' Mr fellows added that the trees are maintained until 2035. The issue came up as councillors discussed the draft Green Living Spaces Plan, which promotes tree planting and looks to protect parks and open spaces, not only to reduce pollution and carbon emissions, but also to promote healthy lifestyles for citizens. The council has a total of more than 70,000 trees lining the roads and many hundreds of thousands in parks, open spaces and gardens - all of which make a contribution to the environment, the committee heard. Criticism: The Taxpayers Alliance criticised the charge by Amey - saying . residents could be forgiven for thinking their street should look like . the Champs-Elysees by the time the company has finished . Feeling the crunch: Birmingham City Council is currently facing £100million of cuts from its budget . A Birmingham City Council spokesman: 'To date, no additional trees have been planted and so Birmingham City Council has not been charged for planting and upkeep of saplings. 'Amey maintains and manages the city’s highways trees as part of its 25 year-long contract with Birmingham City Council. 'This includes looking after all 70,000 existing trees on the highways network. 'Occasionally, it may be necessary to remove a tree, which is then replaced under the terms of the 25 year-long contract at no additional cost. 'If an additional tree was requested there would be an additional cost as this tree would not have fallen within the remit of the original contract. 'However, to date no additional trees have been planted and so no additional costs have been incurred.'","Private company Amey charges £2K a time to plant a tree along a highway .

Pete Townshend has apologised for telling a   seven-year-old fan and her father to 'f*** off' during his concert in Ontario, Canada. The Who star upset Jenny Costello when he targeted her and her father at a show after spotting her homemade 'Smash Your Guitar, Pete!' sign. According to the Toronto Sun Jenny was sat on her father Eric Costello's shoulders . waving the colourful placard. In video footage posted online the musician can be heard saying, 'Go away with that sign please, just go away with it, just go away with it. 'Don't bring your children...

The father was offended by the obscenity and left the concert early with his young daughter. The special education teacher had spent a week's salary - nearly $300 (£199) - on the 15th-row floor tickets. He said he was horrified by the 67-year-old rocker's actions - especially because Townshend is his daughter's idol. 'Nobody talks to my seven-year-old daughter like that,' Mr Costello later told the Toronto Sun. 'I expect a 70-something-year-old man to respect the fact there's a seven-year-old girl standing in front of him.'

Twisted, snapped and buckled, a once sinuous strip of black tarmac has been contorted into the most unimaginable shapes and structures. Deep cracks criss-cross the road next to perilous cliffs where the right of way has shifted vertically below where cars once drove safely along a main road in Derbyshire. Amazingly, the abandoned half-mile long section of road has become one of the county’s busiest tourist routes as cyclists, walkers and off-road bikers are being drawn to explore the challenges of the disused road. Mountain bikers playground: The tarmac on the former A625 road in Derbyshire now looks more like an adventure track for performing bike jumps and tricks . Sheer drop: Father Pete Tye, 43, gets close to the edge of the twisted road, pictured left, while his son Jonathan, five, takes in the stunning scenery, pictured right . The A625 was closed to traffic in 1979 after road repairers eventually gave up a losing battle against a landslide that has slowly been moving down a hillside for thousands of years. Looking like they have been randomly sketched on the road surface, many of the road’s original white lines, now point in haphazard directions separated by deep fissures in the tarmac. Mountain-biker Pete Tye, 43, who was riding the road with his son today, said: 'It’s an amazing place to ride – it’s got some really challenging sections and jumps. 'Although it’s not just mountain bikers that are using it – I’ve seen a couple of road bikes, loads of walkers and a couple of motorbikes up here today too. 'Some people are using this as a route to link up other trails and paths and others are just coming up here to experience the broken road.' Daring: Pete Tye jumps off a nine foot tarmac cliff on the A625 in Derbyshire, which has slowly been destroyed by a landslide moving down a hillside for thousands of years . Lying below Mam Tor, the road was built in 1819 linking Castleton and Chapel-en-le-Frith in the Peak District. Also known locally as ‘The New Road’, the new section bypassed the steeper Winnats Pass route and crossed the ancient Mam Tor landslip. As a result of further movement, major road works were required in 1912, 1933, 1946, 1952 and 1966. In 1974 large parts of the Mam Tor section collapsed during a massive landslip. More road works were carried out but the . force of millions of tons of rock pushing the road further downhill . could not be stopped and eventually the road was abandoned to nature.Motorists now have to use Winnats pass again as another route around the narrow pass has not been built. Jonathan Tye, 5, rides on the road in the Peak District that was closed to traffic in 1979 . The 'old A625' has now become a favourite spot for ramblers and cyclists, especially off-road bikers . Geological . research suggests the Mam Tor landslide happened 3500 to 4000 years ago . and the average downward movement of the landslide is about 25 . centimetres per year but this movement increases considerably during a . very wet winter following a significantly wet summer. The landslide is about 1000 metres . long, the top is about 300 metres across and the spread increases at the . bottom to about 450 metres. Maximum thickness of the landslide is about . 40 metres. At a rough estimate the landslide . contains about 15 million cubic metres of slipping debris weighing in . the region of 45 million tonnes. The . speed of the landslide appears to be increasing. Professor of . Structural Geology, Ernest Rutter, warned: 'Since 1880 the lower arm of . the highway has moved over 40 metres downhill.' Before: The A625 pictured when it was still open in 1976 - and already showing several uneven patches . After: A Google Earth image showing a recent view of the road which has been closed to traffic since 1979 . The Manchester University academic monitors the landslide with probes buried near the old road added: 'The amount of sliding over the winter months is about one meter in the centre of the slide, with a local anomaly of high slip near the upper car park – which we keep a close eye on because it is likely to become more unstable with time. 'It seems likely that the present-day relatively rapid rates of movement in the Mam Tor slide are related to higher winter ground-water levels in recent centuries than for much of the time since the landslide first formed.' On the Castleton Historical Society website a post warns: 'I wouldn’t be at all surprised if we woke up one day and found the whole lot down in the bottom'.","The A625 was closed to traffic in 1979 because of a slow-moving landslide .

West End theatres, including prestige names such as the Old Vic, have been warned to stop duping the public by failing to declare rip-off fees. People making online bookings to see Kiss Me Kate or A Chorus of Disapproval, which starred Rob Brydon and Ashley Jensen, were hit with unexpected charges. Most prime West End theatre tickets are ruinously expensive, with some costing more than £100 each. On notice: West End theatres, including prestige names such as the Old Vic (pictured), have been warned to stop duping the public by failing to declare rip-off fees . Theatres and agencies do try to tempt people with promises of some cheap tickets, perhaps starting at just £10 for a seat miles from the action. However, a transaction fee, which typically ranges from £1.50 to £3, is generally not added to the bill until the final online check-out. While some companies go further and impose a £4 per seat booking fee on top in a manoeuvre that renders the official ticket price meaningless. Now the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has put theatres and ticket agencies on notice that they should declare all compulsory charges at the beginning of the booking process. It is issuing a ruling today against the . Old Vic, the giant Ambassador Theatre Group, which trades under ATG . Tickets, the AKA Group, and the Charing Cross Theatre. Rip-off fees: The Advertising Standards Authority says theatres and ticket agencies should declare all compulsory charges at the beginning of the online booking process . The Old Vic was promoting tickets for Trevor Nunn’s revival of Kiss Me Kate at prices of £16 to £70 without clearly declaring a booking fee of £1.50 for online purchases and £2.50 via telephone. ATG claims to be the UK’s biggest specialist theatre ticket agency, while it also produces shows as well as owning and managing several West End theatres. The company is currently taking bookings for the new musical The Book of Mormon, however consumers must pay a booking fee of £4 per ticket plus a one-off transaction fee of £3. Consequently, someone buying four of the cheapest tickets for £27.50 each, which have a face value of £110, would actually end up paying £19 extra. The AKA Group advertised 100 tickets for every performance of A Chorus of Disapproval at £10, however it failed to clearly spell out there was an extra £3 transaction levy per booking. The Charing Cross Theatre was also guilty of the same confusion by failing to declare a booking fee of £2.

The BBC has become embroiled in another ageism row after it emerged the corporation has dropped its 73-year-old cycling correspondent in favour of a younger commentator. Hugh Porter was the broadcaster’s cycling commentator during London 2012 when Chris Hoy, Bradley Wiggins and Victoria Pendleton all won gold. But the BBC told viewers he ‘had moved on to pastures new’ at the start of the BBC's coverage of the World Track Championships last week. Scroll down for video . Announcement: Cycling correspondent Hugh Porter, pictured commentating at the London 2012 Olympics, has been dropped by the BBC after 30 years at the Corporation . The Corporation added that his role would be filled by someone else - reportedly 43-year-old Simon Brotherton who has covers sporting events for Radio Five Live. But Porter, a former world cycling champion with a 30-year-long commentating career, has revealed it wasn't his choice to step down. He said: ‘I’m certainly not ready to give it up yet. I’m not naive, I know that things change, but it would have been nice to have bowed out with the BBC on agreed terms. Heyday: Hugh Porter won four cycling world titles and a Commonwealth Games gold medal in 1966 . ‘No one can go on for ever, but I still feel I’ve got a lot to offer. This is my sport and no one is more passionate about it.’ Porter, who has covered most cycling events for the BBC since the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, added that he was 'devastated' when he found out he was being pushed out by the BBC and had hoped to go to Rio to cover cycling at the 2016 Olympics. He told the Daily Telegraph: 'I haven’t stepped down and I haven’t gone to pastures new. It was their decision. I’m 73 years of age [and] I hoped I would probably go to Rio. 'I love the sport. I’m not an old wreck or anything like that, my voice is still as strong as ever. If I in any way thought to myself I’m too old for this now, I would be the first to put my hand up.' The cycling champion added that he was annoyed by the BBC attempting to make the move look like a mutual agreement. Porter, who won four world titles in the individual pursuit as well as a Commonwealth Games gold medal in 1966, said: 'They’ve emphasised that I’ve stepped down. I haven’t stepped down. This is the thing that’s really annoyed me. 'It’s been made out ""well done Hugh, he’s been a faithful servant, and now he's retired"", but it’s been their decision, not mine.' The cycling expert added he felt frustrated the the BBC's move came at a time when the sport is becoming mainstream. Porter will still commentate on the skating at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. A BBC spokeswoman said: 'Hugh's age had nothing to do with our decision to replace him. Cycling legend: Hugh Porter, pictured right with Tony Doyle and Bradley Wiggins, said he was unhappy the BBC said he'd stepped down . 'Following the Olympics we conducted a . full review of all of our talent teams and as a result we decided that . Simon Brotherton should lead our TV cycling team. 'BBC Sport judges its talent on its merit as proven by the range and breadth of our on air teams. 'We have confirmed that Hugh would still work for the BBC at next year's Winter Olympics.' Porter's comments threaten to reignite the ageism row that has engulfed the corporation in recent years. It comes after former Countryfile presenter Miriam O'Reilly won a high-profile age discrimination case against the BBC in 2011 after she was dropped from the rural affairs show when it moved to a primetime slot. And former newsreader Anna Ford last year accused the corporation of 'tokenism' after placing a number of older women on screen without giving them full-time contracts.

Film star and martial arts legend Jackie Chan has been asked to give advice to China's leaders during a series of important political meetings in Beijing. The star of the Rush Hour films is one of a number of prominent Chinese people, including former NBA basketball player Yao Ming and Nobel literature prize winner Mo Yan, who will 'advise' the ruling communist party during the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). The Hong Kong actor’s participation in the meeting has been criticised by some in his native city, which often chafes under rule from Beijing. He was also blasted by democracy activists after reportedly suggesting in a Chinese magazine interview that protests in Hong Kong should be restricted. 'There should be regulations on what can and cannot be protested,' Chan told the Southern People Weekly last December.

He added: 'We (Hong Kong residents) do not like repression. We like freedom. But you cannot do whatever you want.' The CPPCC is an advisory body, unlike the National People's Congress, or parliament, which meets today. It includes top film stars, writers, sportsmen, prominent businessmen and religious leaders.

Xi formally takes over as China's new president during the annual meeting, facing a raft of challenges including growing inequality, corruption, environmental degredation, fiscal and political reform and friction with the United States and neighbouring countries. He says the future of the party is at stake and will only be able to mark its 100th birthday in eight years time if officials can learn the lessons of the past. In December, Xi reportedly told officials in Guangdong that China must heed the 'deeply profound' lessons of the collapse of the Soviet Union. 'Why did the Soviet Union disintegrate? Why did the Soviet Communist Party collapse? An important reason was that their ideals and convictions wavered,' Mr Xi said, according to a summary of his comments that was leaked online. Xi, who will take over the reins of state power from outgoing President Hu Jintao at this month's annual full session of parliament, has made fighting pervasive graft a central theme since assuming the top job in the party and military in November. Vigilant: Police officers patrol Tiananmen Square on Segways as delegates arrive at the 12th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference at the Great Hall of the People . 'Only if the capabilities of all party members unceasingly continue to strengthen, can the goal of ""two 100 years"" and ""the dream"" of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese people be realised,' Xi said in a speech marking the 80th anniversary of the Central Party School, which trains rising officials. 'Two 100 years' refers to both the party and the People's Republic of China lasting at least a century each. The People's Republic turns 100 in 2049. The Communists swept to power and founded the republic in 1949 after winning a civil war and forcing Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang, or Nationalist, troops to flee to Taiwan, which Beijing still claims as its own. The concept of 'two 100 years' has been alluded to in state media over the past few weeks, but this is the first time Xi explicitly mentioned it in his speech on Friday, which was carried in whole by the People's Daily, the party mouthpiece.

The great British pint will enter ‘terminal decline’ if new rises in beer tax are not scrapped, George Osborne is warned today. The Chancellor is coming under growing pressure to use the Budget this month to abandon the ‘duty escalator’ which is due to impose another five per cent rise in tax on beer. Campaigners claim the move would save 5,000 and could actually increase the amount of money the Treasury raises by £5million, because fewer pubs will go bust. Steeper than in Spain: The average pint in Britain costs £3.22, compared with £1.70 in Spain . Continental drift: British drinks pay much more than other EU countries, according to the British Beer and Pub Association . The Labour government set up the escalator five years ago, and means beer tax rises by two per cent above inflation every year. Since March 2008, duty has risen by a staggering 42 per cent. The British Beer and Pub Association points to studies which suggest freezing duty will increase the amount of tax Mr Osborne raises by keeping more people in work. In its report Beer, Pubs and the Budget 2013, the BBPA warns beer and pubs in Britain are ‘over-taxed’, at levels higher than most other European countries. The Treasury predicts it will raise less from beer duty in 2013-14 compared with the previous year, despite plans to increase the rate by more than five per cent. Tory MP Andrew Griffiths told MailOnline: ‘The British brewing industry is in crisis. ‘The . hated beer tax escalator is killing brewers and closing down pubs. Unless future increases are scrapped now we could see the terminal . decline of the great British pint.’ Jobs: Campaigners claim 10,000 jobs could be saved by 2015 if George Osborne curbs scraps the beer duty escalator . Big business: The beer industry employes more people than accountancy, civil engineering or the creative arts . BBPA chief executive Brigid Simmons said: ‘UK beer drinkers now pay 40 per cent of the beer tax across the EU, but only consume 13 per cent of its beer. ‘A duty freeze would raise revenues, protect jobs, and help one of our greatest national assets — our much-loved pubs.’ Beer and pubs support 949,000 jobs in the UK, paying close to £13 billion in wages, according to research by Oxford Economics. Almost 150 MPs from all parties have backed a Commons motion demanding a freeze in beer duty. The Chancellor has faced calls from dozens of Tory MPs to do more to cut taxes and go further in removing red-tape for business in next month’s Budget. Conservative MPs have grown increasingly anxious about the voter reaction to the state of the economy, and the impact on household budgets. The demands include tax cuts on March 20 to boost growth, including reductions in duty on alcohol, petrol and air flights. It is claimed a freeze in beer duty would save up to 10,000 jobs by the end of this Parliament. British drinkers pay much more beer tax than other European countries. Excise duty on a pint of lager in Britain is 55.4pence, compared with just 4.6pence in Spain. The average price of a pint in Britain is £3.22 - almost double the Spanish average of £1.70 - of which 54pence is VAT and 55pence is excise duty. The disparity means that if every fan had a pint before Manchester United take on Real Madrid at Old Trafford tomorrow, the tax paid would be £43,000 higher than if the game was taking place in the Spanish capital, according to the Sun. Next round: Seven in 10 drinks bought in pubs are beer . Tax on booze has risen by 42 per cent since 2008, sparking warnings it is leading to the closure of pubs around the country. Matthew . Sinclair, from the TaxPayers' Alliance, told the Sun: 'Spanish fans . will be crying into the beer when they discover how much of the price of . their pint is tax.

Protesters today held a demonstration against the controversial natural gas extraction process called fracking - on a village green opposite the Chancellor's constituency office. The process of fracking, which extracts shale gas deposits from beneath the earth, has been proposed at numerous sites across the British countryside. Chancellor George Osborne is one of the main supporters of shale gas energy - which has been proposed in his own Tatton constituency in Cheshire. Greenpeace campaigners today spent several hours operating a 'fake fracking' work site in Tatton's main town of Knutsford in protest against the plans before closing it down this afternoon. On the Chancellor's doorstep: Greenpeace set up a fake 'fracking' operation on a green opposite George Osborne's constituency office in Knutsford, Tatton . The controversial technique of fracking uses a high-pressured mix of water and chemicals to force out reserves from deep layers of rock . Campaign: George Osborne's Tatton constituency is one of many sites around the UK that has been earmarked for Shale gas extraction . The campaigners also took over a local Conservative club and unveiled a huge banner down the side of the building. The front page of Greenpeace’s website was dedicated to the anti-fracking protest for the day, with a live webcam and statements supporting their cause. A statement on the site said: 'Fracking . is a dangerous gamble that will threaten local environments, derail . efforts to tackle climate change and cost green jobs and investment. Controversial: Chancellor George Osborne is a enthusiastic supporter of developing shale gas energy in Britain . 'Across the street from his office is a beautiful village green where teams of activists have constructed a huge fake fracking operation - to show the Chancellor what his gas nightmare will look like.' Chief Inspector Paul Carroll of Cheshire Police said: 'Police attended a peaceful protest at George Osborne's constituency office in Manchester Road in Knutsford. 'In total approximately 25 people from Greenpeace were at the location. 'Most of the protesters left by 2.30pm. There were no issues, no one was arrested, and there was no impact on the traffic in the area. 'There was a police presence as the role of the constabulary is to impartially allow for peaceful protesting, whilst ensuring that others can continue unhindered in their legitimate business activities, or commuting.' The controversial technique to extract shale gas - known as fracking - uses a high-pressured mix of water and chemicals to force out reserves from deep layers of rock. Campaigners claim drilling could scar the British countryside, pollute water supplies, and clog roads with hundreds of lorries transporting gas and dirty water. In the U.S., fracking has led to local contamination of water with methane and the extraordinary spectacle of people being able to set fire to the water coming out of their taps because of the gas content. Organised: Greenpeace created a fictional company called Frack&Co for the demonstration against fracking . The Greenpeace campaigners took over the local Conservative club as Frack&Co's base for the protest . Climate concerns: Campaigners claim drilling for shale gas will scar the British countryside and cause pollution . Greenpeace environmental campaigner Lawrence Carter said: 'Fracking is an unnecessary practice. We don't need fracking, we don't need shale gas when we have got low-carbon forms of energy which not only deliver but also help the economy by delivering growth.' The process of fracking involves pumping millions of gallons of water and chemicals deep underground to force out natural gas from the surrounding layers of shale rock. Engineers have known about shale gas for more than a century. In 1875, Victorian geologists sank a borehole in Sussex to investigate shale, a finely grained rock - created from compressed mud - which sits in layers. When a flame was lowered into the hole, it exploded, confirming the presence of natural gas. But getting this gas out of the ground is extremely complicated. Below the North Sea, natural gas forms in sandstone and when a drill reaches the gas, it flows out. But shale gas is locked in dense rock. Energy companies must drill a well hundreds or thousands of feet deep to reach the layer of shale – which can be just 50 feet thick - and then turn the drill sideways to bore horizontally. Water, chemicals and sand are pumped into the hole under enormous pressure until the rock cracks, allowing gas locked up in the shale to escape and flow upwards into the well. This process is called hydraulic fracturing - fracking for short. Blackpool is believed to be sitting on one of the biggest shale gas fields in the world – with a reserve of 200 trillion cubic feet lying under the Lancastrian countryside. It’s enough gas to keep the UK going for 50 years, end reliance on imported gas from Russia and create more than 5,000 jobs. It is ten times more than all the natural gas known to be left under the North Sea, and a fifth of the size of the world’s biggest field. In the U.S., where fracking has been carried out for more than a decade, the process has halved the price of natural gas. But opinion is still widely divided on shale gas. Supporters believe it could solve the growing global energy crisis while opponents of fracking continue to argue that it is a dangerous process which should be abandoned. Environmentalists insist the technique releases toxins and methane gas into nearby water supplies - which has already occurred in America - and scupper any chances of cutting greenhouse gases. And after fracking caused an earthquake with a magnitude of 2.3 in Blackpool last April, there are concerns about the scale of the earthquakes it can trigger. Fracking has already been banned in France, New York and New Jersey as well as in Quebec and parts of Switzerland. Today's protest came with the release of a ComRes poll, conducted on behalf of Greenpeace, which found that 12 per cent of residents in Tatton who voted Conservative in the last election would be less likely to vote Tory again if fracking went ahead in the area. 'It seems George Osborne is so wedded to his dash for gas that he's willing to ignore the views of his own constituents,' Mr Carter said. 'It's time the Chancellor stopped trying to play the JR Ewing of Cheshire and concentrated on investment in clean, safe, renewable technology that will create longer term jobs and a more stable economy.' A spokeswoman for Cheshire Police said: 'Cheshire Police have been made aware of an incident at the Knutsford Conservative Club in Manchester Road in Knutsford. 'Officers are in attendance.' Nearly two-thirds of the country could be sitting on shale gas reserves - although estimates of how much is actually below Britain vary wildly. Industry experts believe there may be up to four times more than the previously estimates of 300 trillion cubic feet - enough to supply Britain for many decades. In the next few weeks, an official report by the British Geological Survey is set to be released and expected to announce deposits are far larger than previously predicted. The Chancellor hopes the UK's energy landscape can be transformed by shale gas and help prevent the oncoming crisis - like in the U.S., where drilling has helped drive down prices. In a bid to promote investment in shale gas, the Chancellor is set to offer lucrative tax breaks and a simplified regulatory regime to the industry. And he has the support of David Cameron, who has also backed the technology and said Britain should be at the heart of the shale 'gas revolution', claiming it could bring down the price of household energy bills. Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey has sounded a much more cautious note than his Conservative coalition counterparts, warning shale gas is 'unlikely' to reduce bills and is 'no silver bullet'. However, other energy experts say flooding the market with cheap gas will set back the UK’s move to green energy. Jenny Banks of the World Wildlife Fund said: ‘The world is heading for a rise in temperature if energy use continues as it does now. 'But if we switch to shale gas, then there’ll still be a rise.

Claim: Mark Lowry, 46, pictured outside the Old Bailey, was in the process of suing Ocado after he hurt his back delivering shopping when he was allegedly caught painting and decorating . A home shopping delivery driver who was in the process of suing his company for £360,000 over a back injury was allegedly caught working as a painter and decorator. Mark Lowry, 46, claimed to have hurt his back while unloading a crate of wine at an Ocado customer's flat in Chelsea, central London, and said that he was unable to work because he was left in constant pain, a trial at the Old Bailey heard. But Mr Lowry was caught out when Ocado hired private detectives to check up on him when he launched a lawsuit against the company - and they found him carrying out manual work. Prosecutor Richard Hearnden said: 'It seemed likely the case was going to settle out of court. 'But before that happened Ocado's insurers hired some private detectives to conduct some covert observations on Mr Lowry and report back to them. 'He was observed to do manual work - lifting, reaching up, bending from the waist and so on. 'The whole lawsuit was exposed as a sham. 'When confronted with his evidence he withdrew it.' Mr Lowry joined the home shopping firm in 2005 and was based at their depot in Hatfield, Hertfordshire. He claimed he suffered the injury during a delivery round in October that year, while attempting to remove a heavy crate of wine mistakenly placed on a high shelf in his van. The weight of the container caused him to lose his balance and fall from the rear of his van, he claimed. Mr Hearnden said: 'Whether these events actually occurred is open to question. 'There were no eyewitnesses and no ambulance was called. 'In fact, Mr Lowry tried to carry on with his rounds. He should have telephoned his duty manager but he did not because he said he did not have his mobile with him. Injury: Mr Lowry was delivering shopping in an Ocado van (file picture) in London when he claimed to have hurt his back . 'Indeed, Ocado denied there were even any bottles of wine in the order he was supposed to be delivering. 'Even if the accident did happen in precisely the way Mr Lowry described, he used it as an opportunity grossly to exaggerate his symptoms and thereby make a gain for himself.' He was caught out when the firm hired detectives to follow him for two days in November 2011. They obtained a business card from 'Mark Lowry Decor' and watched as he carried out work. Twelve days later, he signed a witness statement claiming: 'I have been unable to work since the accident.' Mr Lowry claims he only returned to work days before he was caught out . He says his solicitors made an error while drafting his witness statement and he only meant to claim damages up to September 2010. Mr Lowry, from Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, denies a single count of fraud. The trial continues.

Within days of Herbie Hall's wife Ethel dying, the star grappler, was rushed into hospital. Mr Hall represented Great Britain at the . 1952 and 1956 Olympics and won silver for England at the 1954 . Commonwealth Games in Vancouver. True love: Herbie Hall with his wife Ethel on their golden wedding anniversary. Mr Hall was beside himself with sadness when his wife died . Doctors told his family that tests . showed there was nothing medically wrong with Mr Hall but that he was . suffering from a broken heart. Three weeks later, he suffered a heart attack and could not be saved. Niece Tracey-Jayne Mawdsley, 47, from Springhead, Oldham, said: 'Herbie just wanted to be with Ethel. 'They had been together for 70 years and married for 65 and he was lost . without her. He was beside himself with sadness.' Mr Hall married his 'Queen' Ethel at Christ Church in Chadderton in 1948. The pair had met six years earlier at a nearby swimming pool. Champion: Herbie Hall represented Great Britain at the 1952 and 1956 Olympics and won silver for England at the 1954 Commonwealth Games in Vancouver . They remained in love for six decades but after being diagnosed with dementia in 2009, Mrs Hall had to be moved into a care home. But Mr Hall could not stand to be apart from his sweetheart and his family were forced to find a home that would allow the pair of them to stay together in one room. They were moved from their home in Scouthead, Oldham, to Avalon Park Care Home in nearby Salem, where they stayed together for four years until Mrs Hall caught pneumonia. She passed away, aged 85, in hospital on January 25. Mr Hall was admitted to hospital seven days after his wife's death. When doctors could not find anything medically wrong with him, he went back to the care home - but three weeks later he suffered a heart attack and died on his way to hospital on February 26 - what would have been Ethel's 86th birthday. Devoted: Herbie Hall (third from right) with the wrestling team which represented England at the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki. Mr Hall died from a broken heart a month after his wife passed away . His niece added: 'The last month has been very difficult losing them both. But the one thing that has made it more bearable is knowing that they are together now. 'Herbie used to call Ethel his Queen and he was so sad when she had gone. They just wanted to be by each other's side again. There is no doubt in my mind he died of a broken heart.' Mr Hall, whose parents emigrated with him to a farm in Canada before returning home, had a glittering career in wrestling and toured the world. He was a member of Bolton United Harriers and was named in the Guinness Book of Records as featherweight champion of England during his heyday in the 1950s. 'Nowadays he would be a celebrity,' Ms Mawdsley said. 'But he didn't like to talk about his success, especially in the pub. 'He always said if people overheard him in the pub they would challenge him to a fight.' When his career in wrestling came to an end in the early 1960s, Mr Hall worked in a mill in Shaw, while wife was a winder in the cotton mills. They never had any children, but his niece added: 'They loved their family and all their nieces and nephews. 'They were a brilliant aunty and uncle - they were like second parents to us all. I will really miss them both.'","Mr Hall was rushed to hospital days after his wife Ethel died .

Jess Collinson, 24, (pictured making obscene gesture outside York Crown Court today) tried to steal a woman's shoe . A convicted sex offender with a 'fetish for high heels' attempted to swipe a woman's shoe straight off her foot, a court heard. Jess Collinson, 24, who is subject to a Sexual Offences Prevention Order (SOPO) for previous offending of a similar nature, attempted to steal the woman's shoe as she walked home from a takeaway on her birthday night out on October 5 last year. His barrister, Taryn Turner told York Crown Court that her client 'likes stiletto heeled shoes, particularly those which are larger than five inches, and gets sexual gratification from holding such shoes'. Jailing Collinson for 16 months, Judge Stephen Ashurst told him: 'You are a high risk to the public, particularly to lone females, and you have a fetish with high heeled shoes with stiletto heels.' Alan Mitcheson, prosecuting, told York Crown Court:  'At the end of the evening, on the way home, she called into a takeaway,' he said. 'She was sitting on the bench outside with a friend as they ate their takeaway when she noticed a man hanging around nearby. 'She began the short walk home alone and saw the same male walking close behind her. He tried to engage her in conversation and she became very concerned. 'She had almost reached the safety of her home when the defendant approached her and attempted to remove her shoe. 'She kicked out with some force and the defendant made off.' The defendant, who was convicted of robbery for an earlier offence when he succeeded in taking a shoe off another woman, was made the subject of a Sexual Prevention Order in 2010 and was placed under a three-year Community Order. Mr Mitcheson added: 'There was a clear underlying sexual motive in this case. 'The woman has clearly been extremely unnerved by the offence and that has had an affect on her life.' He said the victim was more vulnerable because the offence took place late at night and she had been walking alone, although the degree of force used had been minimal. Collinson, from Scarborough, North Yorkshire, who insisted he had been at home with his partner on the night of the incident, later pleaded guilty to the charge of attempted theft. Taryn Turner, defending, told the court: 'Rarely do such cases come before the court.' Referring to a psychiatric report, Mrs Turner said: 'Mr Collinson likes stiletto heeled shoes, particularly those which are larger than five inches, and gets sexual gratification from holding such shoes. 'For his victim it must have been a very frightening experience. It was not his intent to harm her and he did not intend for her to feel threatened. 'The gravity of this offence is the fact he has caused the distress. It was to satisfy his own sexual needs and urges. 'He has problems which he acknowledges and he would be willing to take any help that could be provided. Collinson's barrister, Taryn Turner told York Crown Court (pictured) that her client 'likes stiletto heeled shoes, particularly those which are larger than five inches, and gets sexual gratification from holding such shoes . 'This man is moved by desires and needs that he doesn't know how to cope with. 'It is low level offending but it is the nature of the offence which makes it troubling.' According to a psychiatric report written in 2010, Collinson 'has a lack of empathy, understanding and motivation' and so no therapy could be offered by the court. Judge Stephen Ashurst, speaking at York Crown Court, said: 'You have the conviction of robbery in similar  circumstances. 'You were in breach of the Sexual Offences Prevention Order and the Community Order when committing this offence. 'You spotted the woman you later followed when you heard her high heeled shoes going down the street. There is no doubt she was terrified. 'Since then, suffered from a lack of confidence and felt very upset. She worries that she might be attacked again. 'You are not motivated to change and so cannot be helped medically at this stage. You are a high risk to the public, particularly to lone females, and you have a fetish with high heeled shoes with stiletto heels. 'The previous Community Order did not prevent you from committing this offence and neither did the Sexual Offences Prevention Order.' Collinson was given a custodial sentence of 16 weeks and a restraining order has been placed on him to prevent any contact with his victim.","Jess Collinson, 24, already subject to .

A mother-of-five has told how an intruder broke into her home and plunged a knife into her side as she slept on the sofa. Mina Robinson, 34, was sleeping in her living room after a full day decorating while her children stayed at her ex-husband's house. She woke up bleeding heavily after an armed raider broke into her home at 10.40pm on February 3 this year and stabbed her with a knife, leaving the blade in her stomach. The care assistant tried to stop her attacker who fled her home in Tamworth, Staffordshire, empty handed but collapsed in agonising pain. She managed to dial 999 and was rushed to Walsgrave University Hospital in Coventry where doctors told her the tip of the knife was close to puncturing her intestine. Ms Robinson underwent four hours of surgery in the early hours of February 4 and remained in intensive care for four days before she recovered. She described, for the first time, the moment she woke to find the knife plunged into her side. 'I was painting my house and fell asleep on the sofa as I was exhausted.' she said. 'Suddenly I heard someone rush past me and then I felt a sharp pain in my side. 'I caught a glimpse of someone running out of my house. Then I looked at my side and I had a knife sticking in me. 'I feel like I went into shock. When I did get to my phone I pressed the first button which was my cousin. The rear of Ms Robinson's house. She is to be moved by the council into a new one as soon as possible . The intruder ran from her house after stabbing her. Ms Robinson now cannot return to her home and is staying with friends and family . 'She couldn't understand me but then I dialled 999 and they said leave the knife there and that help was on its way. 'Police and paramedics turned up and they took me to hospital. They left the knife in because it was acting as a plug to stop the blood. I just remember being in and out of it.' Ms Robinson was given 25 stitches but her wound has since burst - meaning she needed to have the gash repaired with Steristrips because she didn't have enough new tissue. She was told by doctors that she was millimeters from death. She said: 'After the surgery doctors said if it . had gone in a little bit further it would have gone into my intestine . and I wouldn't have survived. Ms Robinson's stitches burst after the incident and she had to go through further proceedures . 'It was literally millimetres from going in my intestine. They said all it needed was a little tap and it would've killed me.' The mother was left so traumatised by the attack that she has refused to sleep in the house and is now staying with a friend in Wednesbury, West Midlands. She added: 'I re-live it every day. It has been four weeks but it's always there in my mind. 'It really isn't something you expect to happen in your own home.

A burial site containing eleven pre-Inca tombs, some dating back more than 1,400 years, has been discovered near a sports centre in Peru. An archaeology team began excavation work at the Huaca Tupac Amaru B site near Peru's national sports village in the capital Lima in December. Yesterday they unveiled their findings so far which include the well-preserved graves containing eleven pre-Hispanic bodies. Eleven pre-Hispanic bodies were discovered at the site - some dating back more than 1,400 years . The skeletons are believed to belong to the Lima and Yschma cultures . The well-preserved skeletons were found wrapped in cloth and surrounded by ceramics, textiles, fruit tree leaves and tools used for agriculture . Archaeologist Fernando Herrera, head of the project, said three sets of remains belong to the Lima culture, which developed between A.D. 200 and 700. The eight other skeletons came from the more recent Yschma culture, between A.D. 1000 and 1400. Each skeleton was found lying on a bed of woven reeds. The bodies were tied with braided rattan - a species of palm - and covered by one or more cloths. They were buried with ceramics, textiles, fruit tree leaves, and tools used for agriculture.

The archaeological team thinks there may be more and is still searching the site. There are many archaeological sites in Lima, including the Huaca Pucllana in the Miraflores residential district that has a towering Lima culture pyramid. Luis Felipa Villacorta, an archaeologist and historian who is director of the private Antonio Raimondi museum, said the find at the sports center will add to 'the mosaic and image of the Lima culture that is very diffuse' compared to the Nazca and Moche civilizations that developed simultaneously in other parts of the coast of what is now Peru. Unfortunately not much is known of the Lima culture, he said, partly 'because the city, the capital, has grown over it.' In addition, there has been more interest in the 'pre-Hispanic cultures that are outside the metropolitan area: the Moche, Nazca, Wari,' he added.

British Gas may be making unsolicited phone calls to more than four million homes every year, a survey found yesterday. The energy giant, which made profits of more than £600million last year, was among the biggest users of cold calling, according to the research. The marketing calls are often regarded as a nuisance or even sinister. Marketing calls are often regarded as a nuisance or even sinister (file photo) There has been particular concern over ‘silent’ calls, when householders pick up the phone but no voice speaks to them. The scale of marketing calls was estimated following a survey carried out in 20,000 homes where an answering unit was fitted to record the number of incoming calls. British Gas was among the most prolific callers, the results showed. It made 7,000 cold calls to 900 homes over the course of a year, almost eight calls to each household. If unsolicited calls from British Gas are made on the same scale nationwide, researchers calculated, it is likely to have made calls to 4.1million homes. Its involvement in the unpopular marketing approach threatens fresh embarrassment for the firm at a time when its high profit levels have been attracting criticism. Figures published last week showed profits of £606million, swelled by increased energy use during the first months of the cold winter, and a 6 per cent price increase in November. The profits were the equivalent of £50 for every one of the 12million homes which buy energy from British Gas. Tory MP Alan Cairns told the Sunday . Telegraph, which commissioned the study, that: ‘Certain groups of people, particularly the elderly who may . be at home all day, will not answer their telephone unless they . recognise the number because they are so concerned about nuisance calls. 'Some people tell me that they are getting five or six of these sorts of calls every day. ‘And when these calls are silent that . causes real concern for the elderly who first thought may be that it is . someone they know who is in trouble and can’t speak or that it is . someone out to frighten and intimidate them. This simply cannot be . allowed to continue.’ The company said yesterday: ‘This is a highly regulated area and we take our obligations extremely seriously. 'When we do call our customers it is always with their permission or when we have undertaken all relevant checks to confirm consent. 'We uphold the highest standards of customer service and when calling it is to offer people information on products and services that may save them money or offer peace-of-mind, such as boiler care.’ A spokesman added that the company was using new calling systems to stop silent calls. British Gas may be making unsolicited phone calls to more than four million homes every year . These play a recorded announcement if the system believes a real person rather than an answering machine has picked up the call. Silent calls happen when an automated unsolicited sales call is made to a number with the intention that a salesman or woman will speak to them. However, when the householder answers the phone, all the call centre sales staff are already tied up on other calls. As a result, the individual who picks up the phone hears only a potentially threatening silence. British Gas said: ‘We have invested heavily in state-of-the art technology which stops silent calls.’ Other companies making heavy used of unsolicited sales calls are Homeserve, TalkTalk and Npower, the survey carried out for the Sunday Telegraph found. Rules on unsolicited sales calls are set by the regulator Ofcom, which has fined companies for making silent calls, but has not named companies which made them. These companies are usually specialist operators working for household name businesses. The regulator allows sales operators to make three per cent of their calls ‘silent’ calls in which nobody speaks to the recipient.","Firm made 7,000 cold calls to 900 homes over the course of a year .

Germany will veto Romania and Bulgaria's bid to join the Schengen passport-free zone if the Eastern European countries push for membership this week. Interior minister Hans-Peter Friedrich warned both nations that if they insist on entry into the scheme 'Germany will veto it and they will fail.' The countries are expected to apply to join the group in a meeting on Thursday, but their bid has been undermined by fears non-Europeans could bribe their way in to the countries and then travel elsewhere in the EU with ease. It is strong language from a politician well versed in more diplomatic speak, but Germany is undergoing an invasion of immigrants from both countries with many cities experiencing extreme social tensions as a result. Problems: The mayor of Duisburg, Germany, claims Bulgarian and Romanian migrants are creating havoc in the city . Only last Friday the left-wing mayor . of the former industrial city of Duisburg spoke of rubbish mountains, . children of immigrants organised into gangs for stealing expeditions and . an apartment block for 200 housing nearly 400 Romanians and Bulgarians. The Schengen accord allows . participating nations to allow its citizens to pass borders without . having to show a passport. 26 nations participate, though Britain has always opted out of it due to security concerns. If Romania and Bulgaria did join Schengen, their citizens would still need a passport to enter Britain, but immigrants would be able to pass through Eastern Europe to countries such as France or the Netherlands, making it much easier to smuggle themselves into the UK. When asked if either Romania or . Bulgaria could have a Schengen entry at a major air or seaport, Mr . Friedrich said 'no,' adding: 'The concept of freeing up certain areas, . such as arrivals by air or via seaports, is likewise unacceptable. 'The EU has long been evaluating . whether or not Romania and Bulgaria are ready for acceptance in the . Schengen area. The last annual report showed progress, but it's not . enough. 'Bulgaria and Romania still have to . be more decisive in the fight against corruption. Those who acquire a . visa through bribery could travel all the way to Germany without further . controls. 'Our citizens will only accept an . expansion of the Schengen area if some fundamental conditions have been . met. That is not yet the case.' 'Mountains of rubbish': Soeren Link described mountains of waster 'taller than I am' outside buildings housing the city's Roma community . The minister also called for stricter . sanctions for anyone who tried to cheat a country's social security . system. Britain particularly fears this scenario when its labour market . is opened to Romanians and Bulgarians in January next year. The Netherlands is also staunchly . opposed to Romania and Bulgaria joining the Schengen club. With . expectations of admission low, Romanian prime minister Victor Ponta now . says his country's membership of Schengen was 'no longer a priority', . even though it is on the agenda for the Thursday meeting. But he added: 'The government has done everything it could so that the decision is positive and I still have hopes for that.' Mr Friedrich, in a parting shot aimed . at Brussels mandarins who take decisions without consulting the people . of the EU, added: 'The Commission has to learn to pay closer attention . to the viewpoints and sensitivities of the people in EU member states. 'The basic attitude of ""Oh, we'll . just turn a blind eye, the main thing is that the EU continues to grow,"" is no longer acceptable for those who have to answer to the citizenry.' 'Social unrest': Interior minister Hans-Peter Friedrich, left, has warned against the influx of immigrants coming from Eastern Europe as Duisburg, right, continues to struggle with its Roma community . Soeren Link, the left-wing mayor of . Duisburg, close to the border with Holland, claims prostitution and . robberies have spiked since the EU's latest members began arriving last . year. 'We are massively affected,' said the . mayor, confirming the fears of the Association of German Cities which . recently warned of 'social unrest' because of the economic refugees. He spoke of rubbish mountains . 'taller than I am' outside of dilapidated housing blocks in the district . where, in one, 400 Bulgarians and Romanians are crammed into just over . 40 apartments. 'Children are misused there and sent on stealing missions,' he claimed in a TV discussion about the problem. Germany . is the continent's most socially-minded nation with a lavish array of . welfare benefits. Some Roma families are claiming over £2,000 a month in . child welfare payments, even though they are technically not supposed . to work in the country until January next year. 'Massively affected': Duisburg's mayor claims Romanian and Bulgarian migrants are costing the city millions per year . 'It . is costing us millions and will cost us more by next year,' added Mr . Link, who said anyone who thought the problem was going to go away was . 'misty eyed'. He added: 'We didn't ask for this . problem and we can't handle it alone.' On his Facebook page the mayor . wrote: 'Platitude slogans and strong words do not help!' His outspokenness earned him the . praise of citizens including pensioner Heinz Hoffmann, 67, who said: 'If . my rubbish spills out on the street I would be slapped with a summons . in no time. Why do they get away with it?'

Devon, who is originally from Ellicot City, Maryland, says he was making a withdrawal with his debit card at the start of February when he noticed the machine began making strange noises. Then, he says, it suddenly spat out 18 crisp $100 bills. Unexpected bonus: Devon Gluck made a withdrawal at his University of Delaware campus branch of PNC Bank. A faulty ATM gave him $1800 in $100 bills . Speaking to the The News Journal, Devon, who is studying finance, said he could do nothing but stare at his pay-out.

A backcountry skier has been killed and another critically injured after they triggered an avalanche in a Colorado mountain pass, in the fourth such fatality in two days as snowslides swept across the US. The unnamed skier's death came less than 24 hours after a snowmobiler died in Utah, a skier . in Wyoming and a climber in New Hampshire. The two men in Colorado were cross-country skiing Saturday on the western side of Cameron Pass, about 135 miles northwest of Denver, when they were buried in the avalanche, said Kent Minor, manager of State Forest State Park. 'There were two sets of ski tracks going in, so the assumption is they caused the avalanche,' Minor said, adding that the slab of snow and ice that broke loose was a quarter-mile wide and 300 to 400 yards long. Beautiful and dangerous: The two men were cross-country skiing on Saturday in a section of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, about 135 miles northwest of Denver, when they were buried in the avalanche . The two skiers were outfitted with avalanche-locator beacons, and rescuers on snowmobiles reached them late Saturday afternoon after battling through deep snow and steep, rugged terrain, he said. The first skier they reached was found dead, and rescuers then dug out the second man, who had been buried for 90 minutes, Minor said. Neither victim has been identified. Minor said it took rescuers on snowmobiles, snowshoes and snow sleds more than five hours to get the injured man to a spot where a helicopter could land and airlift him to the hospital, where he was listed in critical but stable condition. Crews returned to the area on Sunday morning to retrieve the body of the dead skier, Minor said. A dog that accompanied the pair has not been located, he said. Scott Toepfer, a forecaster with the Colorado Avalanche Information Center, said Saturday's incident was the fourth avalanche-related death in Colorado this season and the 13th nationwide. Toepfer said the Colorado fatality brought to four the number of U.S. avalanche deaths so far in March, including a snowmobiler in Utah, a skier in Wyoming and a climber in New Hampshire who were all killed in separate snowslides on Friday. In a typical year, 25 people in the United States perish in avalanches, he said.","On Saturday, a skier was killed in Colorado's Rockies after causing slide .

Details of the incredible creation emerged as the French capital prepares to commemorate the 93rd anniversary of the Armistice. According to archives unearthed by Le Figaro newspaper, military planners believed German pilots could be fooled into destroying the dummy city rather than the real one. Sham Paris: A map shows replica railways and factories around the imitation city which was planned for location in the forest of St Germain. The area in the top right hand corner (A2) was actually constructed . Light show: This camouflage railway was lit up at night to give the illusion of a moving train . All for show: A map revealing sham railways, streets and train stations near Maisons-Laffitte . It was situated on the northern . outskirts of Paris and featured sham streets lined with electric lights, . replica buildings and even a copy of the Gare du Nord - the station . from which high-speed trains now travel to and from London. 'Nearly . a century after the start of the First World War, very little is still . known about this incredible project by the French Army,' writes Benjamin . Ferran, of Le Figaro, highlighting the work of the DCA air defence . group (Difense Contre Avions) 'In . 1918, as the conflict was coming to an end, the DC, which was . responsible for defending territory against air attacks, embarked on the . building of a replica Paris designed to fool the German pilots.

Bombing in Belleville had left destruction, which military officials wanted to avoid by building the fake city . 'By recreating a dummy city including a myriad of bright lights, the French thought they could attract night raiders to the wrong target.' Radar was in its infancy in 1918, and . the long-range Gotha heavy bombers being used by the German Imperial . Airforce were similarly primitive. Their . crew would hold bombs by the fins and then drop them on any target they . could see during quick sorties over major cities like Paris and London. French planners chose . an area around the commuter town of Maisons-Laffitte, some 15 miles . from the centre of Paris, and on a stretch of the River Seine similar to . the one in the capital. The Germans were using long-range Gotha bombers to bombard the city . Famous quartiers of Paris, including those around the Arc de Triomphe and Opera, were created, as well as industrial suburbs like Saint-Denis and Aubervilliers. Private firms were used to create the city, with an electrical engineer called Fernand Jacopozzi hired to illuminate the second 'City of Light'. Wooden replicas of buildings were completed with ingenious details, including translucent paint creating the impression of the 'dirty glass roofs of factories'. The dummy city was equipped with a replica Champs Elysee (original pictured left) and a copy of the Gare du Nord railway station (right) White, yellow and red lamps were also used to create the effect of machines in operation at night, while false trains and rail tracks were also partly illuminated at night. But, despite such details, the replica Paris was not quite finished before the last German air raid in Paris, in September 1918, meaning it was never tested. While Paris remained largely unscathed from both World Wars, London was severely damaged, with thousands killed or injured. A raid by Gothas on the English capital in June 1917 saw 162 people killed, including 46 children at a kindergarten in Poplar, in the East End. Up to 500 more people were injured. One of the reasons for the high number of casualties was because bombing raids were a relative novelty in Britain, with many civilians crowding together to watch them. Paris, in contrast, prepared far better. At the end of the war Jacopozzi was honoured for his defensive work, and went on to find fame illuminating the Eiffel Tower for the first time.","Replica Paris was not quite finished before the last German air raid - meaning it was never tested .

"By . Liz Hull . UPDATED: . 04:40 EST, 6 March 2012 . John Iveson, 36, disappeared 'without trace' just weeks before the birth of his sixth child - a son he has never met . A wealthy businessman was murdered and his body possibly fed to pigs following a row over a house sale, a court heard yesterday. John Iveson, 36, disappeared ‘without trace’ just weeks before the birth of his sixth child - a son he has never met. Although a £30,000 police reward was offered for information on his whereabouts, Mr Iveson has never been found. Yesterday agricultural workers Paul Billington, 40, and Mark Done, 47, went on trial accused of murdering Mr Iveson more than five years ago. Chester Crown Court heard Billington, a pig farmer and father-of-four, owed Mr Iveson ‘tens of thousands of pounds’ from the sale of his detached home. Mr Iveson, described as a ‘wheeler-dealer’ and ‘hard-man,’ had been threatening and calling Billington up to 20 times a day to demand his cash. Andrew Thomas, QC, prosecuting, said Billington had become desperate because Mr Iveson was taking every penny from him and he was struggling to make ends meet. With the help of poultry farmer, Done, the pair killed Mr Iveson and got rid of his body on his farm, possibly feeding the property developer’s remains to pigs, the barrister added. ‘As farmers they had access to vehicles to move the body and land on which the remains could be disposed,’ Mr Thomas said. ‘Paul Billington used to incinerate pig carcasses on his land. He had macerating equipment to chop materials for feed. ‘Even pigs themselves have been known to eat human remains. In short, although we do not know what happened to John Iveson, a pig farmer would be very well placed to dispose of a body without a trace.’ The jury was told that in 2006 Iveson agreed to sell his £325,000 family home, in Riverbank Close, Nantwich, Cheshire, to Billington. He wanted to use the cash to buy land at Mile House Farm, a £550,000 farmhouse, in Worleson, near Nantwich, which he already part owned. But Billington, of Rossett, near Wrexham, north Wales, struggled to find the cash and, in January the following year, Mr Iveson began threatening him that he needed his money. Agricultural workers Paul Billington, . 40, left, and Mark Done, 47, right, went on trial accused of murdering Mr Iveson more . than five years ago. Both deny the charge . ‘By the time of his disappearance John Iveson was demanding a very large sum of money from Mr Billington,’ Mr Thomas said. ‘He wanted the money within a matter of days. He was telephoning Mr Billington up to 20 times a day and making threats. Mark Done was involved in the financial arrangements - he was a friend of both men. ‘Mr Iveson treated Mr Billington contemptuously. He had bullied him all the time he had known him. Paul Billington was becoming ill with worry. John Iveson was taking every spare penny he could get, leaving his own family without enough to pay their own bills.’ Mr Iveson was last seen at around 6.30pm on January 30 2007 when Billington turned up at his home to collect him for a meeting. Earlier in the day he had been making arrangements to go out and celebrate his younger sister, Lucy’s 21st birthday, the court heard. Despite several mistaken ‘sightings’ of Mr Iveson over the past five years it is ‘inconceivable’ that he simply walked away from his life, Mr Thomas added. Billington's farm in North Wales. Prosecutors told the court the pair killed Mr Iveson and got rid of his body on Billington's farm possibly feeding the property developer's remains to pigs . At the time of his disappearance his wife, Julie, 35, was heavily pregnant with the couple’s sixth child, a son, named Ryan, who was born on March 12. She reported him missing, sparking a wide-ranging police investigation, including an appeal on the BBC’s Missing Live. Mr Iveson worked on big contracts demolishing old warehouses and selling reclaimed materials on for profit. He topped up his income by dealing in imported cigarettes. Mr Thomas said Mr Iveson’s life was a ‘complicated’ one. ‘He was something of a wheeler dealer, a rogue, a criminal who had spent 18 months in prison for violent disorder and wounding,’ Mr Thomas said. ‘He was generous to his wife - he was never short of money and bought her a BMW 4x4 car as a birthday present. ‘However, he had a short temper and there were times when he could be violent. ‘John Iveson had a number of affairs and one-night stands. He used to visit a strip club and massage parlour. But whether the victim is a saint or sinner, murder is murder.’ The case is reminiscent of the Thomas Harris novel and film, Hannibal, in which serial killer Hannibal Lecter’s only surviving victim attempts to capture him and feed him to pigs. The body of undercover British soldier Captain Robert Nairac was also reportedly ground up and fed to pigs after her was beaten and murdered by the Provisional IRA in 1977. Billington and Done, of Nantwich, Cheshire, deny murder. The case continues.

In July 2009, my husband took me to Henley Royal Regatta, the scene of many of his youthful triumphs. We enjoyed a long, hot sunny day sipping Pimm’s. It was bliss, not least because since being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis the summer before, I had become increasingly anxious about outings to beaches or markets, or even parties and weddings. For years, I’d been suffering increasing tingling and numbness in my limbs that became impossible to ignore. A clicking hip while pregnant with my youngest son – now seven – was followed by weakness in my leg, numbness in both feet, night cramps and weak bladder control. After myriad appointments, tests and MRI scans, I received my diagnosis: primary progressive multiple sclerosis. Scroll down for video . Patient choice: Anastasia Parks has to buy Low Dose Naltrexone privately . This is an uncommon form of the neurological condition which progresses inexorably. But like all variations of MS, in which the immune system turns inward and attacks the nervous system causing a raft of worsening symptoms, there is no cure. You are on your own. Anything involving walking and standing became difficult. But then came  salvation: a little-known treatment which I had been taking for just a month at that point called Low Dose Naltrexone (LDN). I found, like thousands of other British MS patients, that it vastly improved  my symptoms. Yet, incredibly, Naltrexone – traditionally used as a way to treat heroin addiction – has not been licensed for use in MS, so must be bought privately. And the majority of mainstream doctors dispute it is of any use, so trials are unlikely. I am an Oxford-educated 50-year-old woman and like any intelligent person I read about any new drug trumpeted as a miracle cure in the press, where there is the odd flash of hope. Sadly, I have become used to taking the news of breakthroughs with a hefty dose of cynicism. Any innovation takes an age to reach the market and waiting for drugs to be assessed means patients are left despairing. Private help: Naltrexone costs £300 a year - just 82p a day - but is not available on the NHS as it has not been trialled to combat MS . I wrote about my condition and its impact on a busy mother of three boys in this newspaper early in 2009. I received a slew of emails from readers, particularly fellow sufferers of MS, who urged me – in sensible, enthusiastic and articulate ways – to try Naltrexone. It is a class of drug known as an opioid antagonist and works by inhibiting natural feel-good chemicals called endorphins, thus forcing the body to produce more. In turn this reduces painful symptoms and increases a sense of well-being. It is given to drug addicts in a dose of 50mg, but since 1985 in the United States it has been used by a growing minority of innovative doctors in much smaller doses of 3mg to 4.5mg daily for the treatment of autoimmune disease. Happy pills: Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist and forces the body to produce endorphins . When I asked, my GP maintained – and still does – that the scientific evidence for the effectiveness of LDN was weak. My  neurologist feels the same, and says he would not support its use without further clinical data. But other medics feel differently. Don’t forget that the drug is available on the NHS already, just for different conditions. ‘Three Health Secretaries have given written approval of its use on the NHS, yet so many GPs and neurologists still refuse to prescribe it,’ says Dr Bob Lawrence, who is listed on the LDN Research Trust website. He has a personal history of MS and has prescribed LDN since 2000, crediting the resolving of his medical problem to the drug. ‘At less than £300 a year – about 82p a day – the cost is minimal compared with, for example, beta interferon, another drug for MS which costs between £9,000 and £12,000 a year,’ he says. ‘The reason no one prescribes it is because it hasn’t been trialled.’ I understand the refusal to prescribe new drugs without scientific basis but all I was left with was an airy suggestion to take extra Vitamin D. So I bought LDN through a website recommended by the LDN Trust. It asked for written confirmation from my doctor of my diagnosis, and I took my first dose in bitter-tasting liquid form in July 2009. What did I have to lose? I didn’t notice any immediate difference to my left leg, but at least the day was not  punctuated by frequent dashes to the loo. The next morning I realised I had slept better than usual because I hadn’t been up during the night. Not once. Walking to work the following week my leg had stopped dragging as it had been doing. The effects were minor, but noticeable, both physically and mentally. So I have continued to take LDN. It feels positive to be taking something hopeful. LDN isn’t a miracle cure, and it’s not held up as one. Now my left leg is weaker. I can’t walk as far without getting tired. But, almost four years since I started taking it, it hasn’t got worse. Apart from a yearly check-up with my neurologist, I don’t think about my condition. I still limp but the rest of my life – my sons, a husband, part-time work, holidays – continues. What is so galling is that LDN supporters are forced to come across as evangelical nutters.

Officials referred the report to SMU’s internal judicial system. The first panel (three students, a faculty member and a staff member) found Cuba guilty of sexual assault, according to two sources close to the investigation.

Serious questions have been raised in the past about the fairness of the university’s approach. In 1990, a secret panel found an SMU student guilty of sexually assaulting another SMU student only to have a second panel overrule that decision in 1991, a decision upheld by then-President A.

A drug can prolong the lives of patients with advanced bowel cancer by six weeks. Patients taking the medication lived an average of 13.5 months compared to 12 months if given a placebo. Zaltrap, which cuts off the blood supply to tumours, has now been licensed for use in the late stages of the disease. It will be offered to people who have not responded to chemotherapy. Prolonging lives: Cancer patients on Zaltrap lived an average 13.5 months compared to 12 months on a placebo . Mark Flannagan, CEO of Beating Bowel Cancer, said: 'This is excellent news. We welcome any treatment which gives new hope  to and improves the prospects of patients living with metastatic colorectal cancer in the UK. ' Results from the study of 1,266 patients also found those given the drug also had an improvement in the time they lived before their cancer progressed - 6.9 months compared with 4.7 months for those on a placebo. At 30 months the improvement in survival was almost double for Zaltrap, with survival rates of 22 per cent compared with 12.0 per cent for placebo. Almost 40,000 people are diagnosed with bowel cancer each year in the UK, with around 5,000 having advanced disease. 'Excellent news': Beating Bowel Cancer CEO Mark Flannagan said he welcomes any treatment which gives people hope . Professor David Ferry, Consultant Medical Oncologist, Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust, said patients would be eligible for the drug if previous chemotherapy had failed. He said the advance in survival was significant, particularly as the drug worked in a different way from existing agents. Zaltrap is an angiogenesis inhibitor which works by cutting off the blood supply to tumours. Prof Ferry said 'Between a third and a half of patients get prolonged benefit and it is well tolerated, with few side effects.' A course of treatment costs around £6,000 and the drug has yet to be assessed for approval on the NHS by the drug rationing watchdog Nice (National Institute for health and Clinical Excellence). Protests by cancer doctors in the US last autumn led to a price cut by French drugmakers Sanofi. Prof Ferry said 'I'm optimistic that Nice will find its cost-benefit ratio acceptable and give patients a new option.' Dr Rob Glynne-Jones, Macmillan Lead Clinician in Gastro-Intestinal Cancer, at the Mount Vernon Cancer Centre, Northwood, said advanced bowel cancer was a difficult disease to treat. He said 'The goal in recent years has been to develop more targeted therapies which aim for high efficacy but with reduced side effects. 'Zaltrap is a novel agent which has produced results that extend life in the later stages of colorectal cancer and has the potential to significantly impact survival rates in the future.'","Patients on Zaltrap lived 13.5 months compared to 12 months with a placebo .

Only working immigrants from Europe should be allowed into Britain, David Cameron suggested yesterday. The Prime Minister also said he wanted new restrictions that would mean incomers from the EU having access to state-funded benefits restricted as part of a new relationship between the UK and Brussels. Mr Cameron warned Paris and Berlin he intends to block moves to allow eurozone nations to come closer together unless Britain is allowed to repatriate some powers from the EU. Crackdown: David Cameron said the Government should look at making restrictions on access to benefits for migrants . Speaking to Andrew Marr (pictured left), Mr Cameron said only working immigrants from Europe should be allowed into Britain . He said it would be ‘difficult but possible’ to renegotiate a better deal for Britain as the EU thrashes out a new treaty among eurozone countries. Mr Cameron singled out rules on immigration and working hours as vital areas. ‘One of the key reasons of being a member of the European Union are what are called “the key freedoms” – the movement of services, the movement of goods, and the movement of people,’ he said. ‘Now, there are restrictions already on the movement of people if you have, for instance, an emergency. Should we look at arguments about if it should be harder for people to come and live in Britain and claim benefits? Yes, frankly we should.’ Home Secretary Theresa May is understood to be already examining possible curbs on access to welfare for EU citizens, and the rights of their dependants to come to this country. Limits on the number of people from Bulgaria and Romania who can move to live in Britain are due to expire within a year. The Prime Minister also singled out EU rules limiting working hours as an area of concern. He told BBC1’s  Andrew Marr Show: ‘The working time directive in my view should never have been introduced... because it’s actually affecting things like the way we run our hospitals, rather than simply about business and trade and the single market.’ He again made clear he believes Britain should not leave the EU, but rather negotiate a looser, more trade-based relationship. Mr Cameron said that voters will be offered a 'real choice' about the UK's membership of the EU . The UK Independence Party has demanded that there be an in-out referendum to decide whether the country stays a member of the EU . Speaking ahead of a key speech later this month in which he will outline his stance on Europe, Mr Cameron said that voters will be offered a ‘real choice’ about the UK’s membership of the EU. But there would be no in-out referendum, which has been demanded by senior eurosceptic Tories and the UK Independence Party (UKIP). David Cameron called some members of UKIP (leader Nigel Farage pictured) 'odd' Mr Cameron added: ‘There is going to be a large negotiation in Europe. When I became Prime Minister, people said to me ‘Don’t worry, the one thing you won’t have is any treaty changes in Europe’. ‘I think we have already had three. One we vetoed so we aren’t involved in at all... and we have had two others. People should be in no doubt that the Conservatives will be offering at the next election a real choice and a real way giving consent to that choice.’ The Prime Minister was then asked by Mr Marr about his previous description of UK Independence Party members as ‘fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists’. Mr Cameron added: ‘There are some pretty odd people.’ Speaking to Dermot Murnaghan on Sky News, UKIP’s leader Nigel Farage hit back at the swipe. He said: ‘It shows how disconnected he is. If he wants to go on being rude about me and rude about UKIP well let him do it, we won’t lose any sleep over it. ‘I don’t think there is any prospect of any deal with the Conservative Party all the while that man leads it, given the way he has behaved and his attitude towards us. ‘Look, I would do a deal with the devil if it got us what we need, which is a free and fair referendum so that we in this country can decide who governs us.’","PM said only working immigrants should be allowed into Britain .

One of the prostitutes accused of murdering a millionaire was one of his 'main girls' who was given $3,000 a month from him and knew the layout of the mansion in which he was robbed and killed, it was revealed today. Katrina Fritz, 32, of Pittsburgh was receiving an allowance from Raveesh 'Ravi' Kumra, 66, a cell-phone entrepreneur and former owner of Mountain Winery in Saratoga, to help her buy her own home. Kumra's body was found on November 30 at his 7,000 square-foot home in Monte Sereno. He was gagged with packaging tape and suffocated. His wife was beaten and told to 'be quiet if you want to live'. Katrina Fritz faces charges in the slaying of Raveesh Kumra . The thieves made off with cash, jewelry and rare coins before his wife was able to call police. Fritz was charged on Friday with murder and robbery after a letter was found on Kumra's computer saying he would pay $30,000 toward her new home. Three other defendants were earlier charged with the same counts - Deangelo Austin, 21, Javier Garcia, 21 and Lukis Anderson, 26. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, phone records showed numerous calls between siblings Fritz and Austin, and placed Austin in the area of the victim's home at the time of the murder, police said. Kumra frequently hired prostitutes and Fritz was known to be one of his 'main girls'. Several prostitutes 'would have run of . the house, able to go anywhere including (Kumra's wife's) room when she . was not there', a witness told police. Los Gatos police Detective Cpl Erin Lunsford wrote in documents filed in Santa Clara County Superior Court that Fritz had even visited Kumra's . home with her children. The 32-year-old had recently become angry at Kumra, however, as she had accused him of giving her an STD and also because he told her that he was 'running out of money and would not be able to pay for any child they might have together', Lunsford wrote. Law enforcement officials . told the San Francisco Chronicle that gang members Austin and Garcia . joined forces to commit the robbery and murder after Dixon gave them a . tip-off. The same sources said that Austin is . believed to be affiliated with the Money Team gang and that Garcia is . thought to be associated with Ghost Town. Javier Garcia, 21 (left) and Lukis Anderson, 26 . have been charged with the murder of 66-year-old businessman Raveesh . 'Ravi' Kumra . Deangelo Austin, 21, (left) is also charged with . the businessman's murder and allegedly received a tip-off from Raven . Dixon, 22, regarding the layout of the millionaire's home . This comes two weeks after it was claimed the millionaire businessman led a sordid life filled . with prostitutes, drink and drug problems, illegitimate children and a . sham divorce, court papers revealed this week. Raveesh 'Ravi' Kumra, 66, was found dead in his Monte Serlo, California, mansion on November 30 . and though a prostitute and three men were arrested in connection with . his death, police are remaining tight-lipped about the details, except . to say it was not a random act of violence. Volumes . of court files presented approximately two weeks ago to Santa Clara County's Sunnyvale . courthouse painted Kurma as a ruthless businessman who lived a sordid . and debauched lifestyle full of lies and deceit. One email from a  former CEO of Kumra's Tesla Capital venture . firm, to another former Tesla executive said: 'Ravi has never treated anyone fairly in . his life, except for his whores.' It also detailed that his 2006 divorce from his wife Harinder was a sham in order to hide millions of dollars in assets, according to Mercury News. Ravesh 'Ravi' Kumra, 66, a cell-phone entrepreneur and the former owner of Mountain Winery in Saratoga. His body was found after his wife summoned police to the couple's ransacked, 7,000-square-foot home in Monte Sereno, in the hills west of San Jose . The mansion: Kumra's ex-wife, Harinder was also home at their large villa in Monte Sereno and was tied up during the attack. She told police she believed three or four people had entered the family's mansion . Ravel Chanel Dixon, 22, a single mother and college student, was arrested last month for allegedly offering sex, drugs or money to an undercover cop. It was after her arrest she was linked to Kumra's murder. The millionaire is best known for owning Mountain Winery in the 1990s. Kerry Harris, spokesman for the police . department, said last month: 'We have not exhausted all investigative . leads at this time and until that happens, we can't be sure that we . have all the suspects. 'At that point in time, we will be able to . paint a more complete picture.' At 1.30am on November 30, Harinder called police to the couple's gated Monte Sereno estate and said she had been beaten up and her husband tied up after four intruders broke in. When police arrived they found Kumra dead. Harinder was taken to hospital for her injuries. They have not said whether or not anything was stolen from the home during the break in. Former CEO Stephen Kaffee said that before he died, Kumra told him that his divorce was 'on paper only', that he had an illegitimate child whose mother was trying to extort hundreds of thousands of dollars from him and that he received a 90-day suspended jail sentence in the late 1990s due to his alcohol-fueled and violent behavior. Kaffee wrote in a 2007 declaration filed . in the divorce proceedings: 'However successful Kumra may have once . been in business, in my opinion his chronic abuse of alcohol, his . chronic use of marijuana, his failure to address his health problems, . and his immersion in a fantasy world of prostitutes and illegitimate . children have left him without the interest or ability necessary.' Charged in connection to homicide: The visibly frightened Dixon, of Alameda County, California, was charged with 'accessory after the fact' in the November 30 killing of 66-year-old millionaire investor Raveesh Kumra . When the couple divorced, the house, the . furnishings, the Mercedes, a cellular phone company and the Tesla . venture capital firm were signed over to his wife, which Kaffee believes was done to avoid a pending lawsuit involving Kankakee Cellular of Illinois stripping him of his millions. The lawsuit accused Kumra of using funds from the Kankakee bank account 'to pay . for escort services, prostitutes, purchasing condominiums for his . female companions and other personal expenses'. He was supposed to have a management role in the firm but court papers said he 'performed virtually no services whatsoever'. In return, Kurma accused Kaffee and another executive of trying to embezzle money from him. The case was later dismissed. Kumra was the first homicide victim in Mountain View, California, in 40 years.

Councils who ‘cheat’ the system to force up council tax bills without the backing of local people are to be punished by the government. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles warned town halls they must ‘be straight with people’ and not use loopholes to avoid holding local referendums on rises of more than two per cent. Just a third of councils - 115 from 351 - have so far agreed to a freeze in bills, compared to 99 per cent in 2011 and 85 per cent last year. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles accused councils who try to avoid holding a referendum on rises in council tax of being 'democracy dodgers' Mr Pickles attacked ‘democracy dodgers’ planning to impose rises of 1.99 per cent without seeking permission from local residents. He said he wanted council tax to be frozen, without cuts to services like bin collections or filling potholes. But many council leaders warns that after two years of cuts in funding from Whitehall they are unable to sustain services without increasing council tax bills. Mr Pickles insisted that authorities who sanction big rises in bills had to explain it to local people. The BBC has come under fire for the way it reports the government's austerity programme. Eric Pickles said the 'wasteful' corporation needed to curb its own spending and rethink the language it uses to describe public spending reductions. 'You would think listening to the BBC that sensible savings and improved services were a bad thing,' the Communities Secretary wrote in the Daily Telegraph. 'To them every saving is a cut. It’s high time the BBC curbed some of her wasteful ways and became more transparent with our cash.' Downing Street refused to say if David Cameron agreed with Mr Pickles. 'How broadcasters report is a matter for them,' the Prime Minister's official spokesman said. 'What the Prime Minister is doing is getting on with making the case for the government's economic policy. ‘I don’t have a problem with councils that want to put up council tax if they have a good reason – to fund local opportunities,’ he said in an article for the Daily Telegraph. ‘But I do have an issue if they don’t ask permission first. They have to man up. Be straight with people. Take them into their confidence. 'If the public believes you’ve got a sensible case they might well listen. But councils should also stop treating residents with contempt.’ The threshold for triggering a referendum on council tax rises has been lowered to two per cent. ‘Democracy dodgers who try creep in under the radar, putting up their stealth tax by 1.99 per cent in a bid to avoid our 2 percent referendum threshold, need a reality check,’ Mr Pickles said. ‘We will take into consideration anybody cheating their taxpayers. Anybody using loopholes will lose out next year.’ Local authorities had to cut waste, innovate and focus on ‘putting people first’, Mr Pickles add. ‘What residents really want is cuts to taxes not bin collections; potholes filled not pockets. Councils that put their people first, will get the idea. To those that don’t we’re sending out a message loud and clear. ‘The days of the knee jerk tax and spend hike are over. And there is a clear dividing line here. We want to freeze council tax and save on average families 72 pounds a year on a band d property. Labour scoff at this and brand it a gimmick. It just shows how out of touch they are.’ However Sir Merrick Cockell, chairman of the Local Government Association (LGA), said: 'Councils have the skills, confidence and ambition to lead our communities, but to see the true benefits of local decision-making, particularly around creating the right environment for stimulating economic growth, we need the freedom to make independent decisions about local issues. 'England is one of the most centralised democracies in the world. Even within our own Union, locally-elected representatives in England have less power to make decisions on behalf of their communities than those in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. 'It is time for Government to let go of the reins and give councils the independence to meet the needs of their communities and offer genuine local accountability.'","Communities Secretary Eric Pickles warns town halls not to use 'loopholes' to avoid a referendum on big council tax rises .

Noble death: Just as Osman (left) died trying to help someone, he also helped people in his death, like 69-year-old Paul Mores, who now has Osman's heart pumping inside him . ‘He died a noble death,’ said Ty Osman. As he helped the woman, the younger Ty was struck and killed by a passing truck, while the woman he sought to help survived. And so, thanks to Ty, did three other men. These are the people with whom Ty and Nancy chose to spend the one-year anniversary of their beloved son’s death. Trying to heal: Osman's father, also named Ty (right) listened his son's heart as it beat inside 69-year-old Paul Mores . Better times: As the recipients of Ty's organ's gathered with their families and with Ty's, Ty's mother Nancy told stories about her beloved son . In attendance were the three men saved by Osmon's organs as well as their grateful families. Thanks to one of Ty’s kidneys, a man named Fletcher Carter was able to attend the event. ‘Even though that truck may have hit . that kidney, it’s working fine’ Carter said to the laughs of a room everyone in the room. Kelly Barns and Paul Mores were also able to attend.

Leith took the covers leaving gaping holes in roads in North Worcestershire, Warwickshire and the West Midlands. Jailing Leith, Judge John Steel QC said: 'You were wholly reckless in your disregard to the public and it was simple good luck that no one was injured.' The court heard Leith stole the drain covers to sell as scrap after he lost his job as a fireman and became addicted to cannabis. But despite their enormous worth, Leith made just £428 selling the covers to a scrapyard in Kingswinford, West Midlands. He was arrested in January last year when a member of the public saw his rental van acting suspiciously and called West Mercia Police. When officers pulled Leith over, they found almost 20 drain covers in the back. Leith's home was searched but none of the other drain covers were recovered. The court heard the theft of drain covers had been common in Worcestershire, with more than 1,000 stolen in the county between mid 2011 and early 2012, costing the local authority more than £250,000. Worcestershire County Council said it was now replacing broken and stolen drain covers with non-metallic ones. Speaking after the case, Councillor John Smith said: 'Unfortunately, the theft of drain covers is a real problem and the scale of this one case in particular highlights this. 'Not only does it cost the residents of Worcestershire money but criminal acts like this put lives at risk. Valuable: Although the drains, like the one pictured, were worth more than £42,250, Leith made just £428 selling them to a scrap dealer . 'I'm pleased that justice has been done and hope this is a deterrent to anyone tempted to do anything like this in the future.' PC Tom Birchley, from West Mercia Police, added: 'Stealing drain covers and leaving gaping holes in the road clearly put members of the public at risk. 'As well as the obvious safety implications, the cost of replacing the drain covers was huge, and needed to be met from public funds.'","Graham Leith, 27, admitted stealing 170 drain covers over three months .

When Joshua Blackaby and his school friends released 300 helium balloons as part of a school project he never could have imagined that it would make it all the way to Australia. The six-year-old was stunned when he received a letter from a girl called Millie, telling him that she had found his balloon in her back garden in New South Wales. The balloon had made it a staggering 10,545 miles from Derby to Millie's home in East Kurrajon, around 50 miles from Sydney. Airmail: Joshua Blackaby was amazed when he received a letter telling him that a balloon he released as part of a school project had been found in Australia . Epic adventure: Joshua's balloon travelled 10,545 miles from Alvaston, Derby to East Kurrajon in New South Wales, Australia . Pupils at the Wyndham Primary Academy in Alvaston, Derby, launched the 300 tagged balloons in December last year and although some of his friends' efforts made it to Denmark and The Netherlands - no one could match Joshua's efforts. 'We thought that was amazing,' said home school co-ordinator Suzannah Hemmings. 'However, on our return from the February half-term holiday, a letter arrived from Australia addressed to one of our pupils, Joshua Blackaby. 'With great excitement he opened it in front of his class to reveal the balloon tag and a letter from a little girl called Millie who had found the balloon and tag in a tree in her garden in East Kurrajong, about 50 miles from Sydney in New South Wales.' Safe return: Joshua's new penpal Millie wrote to say she had found the balloon and returned it along with his tag . The school had been using the balloon's flight to give pupils a greater understanding of geography and the weather. Ms Hemmings said that the school was now considering asking a weather expert to work out how the balloon had made it so far. 'The children are looking into the possible flight the balloon would have taken and writing stories about the adventures and sights and sounds on its journey,' she said. 'We are looking at getting an expert in on weather patterns and wind direction to give an indication of how the balloon would have travelled to Sydney.' Millie's letter, which she signed, . was written by an adult and said: 'Hi. My name is Millie and I found . your balloon in a tree in my back garden. I am very excited and pleased . to send it back.' Joshua said that he would be writing back to his new Australian friend. He said: 'I can't believe the balloon went all that way. I am looking forward to writing back to the girl.' Amazed: Joshua's mum Coleen said she was 'gobsmacked when she found out how far the balloon had travelled . Joshua's mother Coleen Blackaby, 28, said: 'I was very amazed. I was just gobsmacked when I found out it had made it to Australia. 'Joshua was surprised when the letter came to school on Monday. It was just a normal helium balloon.' There have been cases of balloons from the UK being found in Hong Kong. Charlie Powell from the Met Office, was amazed that the balloon had travelled so far, but said that such events were not unheard of. 'There is no reason why the balloon shouldn't be swept up into a low part of the jet stream,' he said. 'There are two jet streams in each hemisphere and they wobble their way around the world, travelling at hundreds of miles an hour.

Russia officials voiced their skepticism on Saturday about the U.S. autopsy on a 3-year-old adopted Russian boy in Texas, demanding further investigation as thousands rallied in Moscow to support the Kremlin ban on U.S. adoptions of Russian children. Max Shatto's death in January, ruled accidental, came a month after Moscow passed a ban on international adoptions in retaliation for a new U.S. law targeting alleged Russian human rights violators. Russian officials have pointed at Max's case to defend the ban, which has drawn strong public criticism and Russians took to the street in Moscow in a rally to support the government's measures to stop American adoptions. The boy, born Maxim Kuzmin, died on Jan. 21 after his adoptive mother, Laura Shatto, told authorities she found him unresponsive outside their home where he had been playing with his younger brother. Outrage: Demonstrators hold portraits of adopted Russian children who have died in the U.S., during a massive rally in Moscow on Saturday . Protests: This woman holds a sign that reads 'Juvenile judiciary. Give us parents back!' Demonstrators walked along Moscow streets to support the new law prohibiting the adoption of Russian children by Americans . Rally: Activists from pro-Kremlin children's advocacy groups march through Moscow, demanding the return of an adopted boy whose brother, Max Shatto, died in Texas . ‘I had four doctors agree that this is the result of an accident,’ he said. ‘We have to take that as fact.’ Konstantin . Dolgov, Russian Foreign Ministry's Special Representative for Human . Rights, said on Saturday that Moscow 'proceeds from the understanding . that these are the preliminary results of the investigation' and urged . U.S. authorities to produce autopsy documents and the boy's Russian . passport. Alan and Laura Shatto adopted Max and his half brother, two-year-old Kristopher, from . an orphanage in western Russia this past fall. Laura Shatto told authorities she . found Max unresponsive outside their Gardendale, Texas, home while he . was playing with his younger brother. The boy was pronounced dead a . short time later. Autopsy: The medical examiner ruled that the death of Max Shatto was an accident . Accused: Kremlin accused Laura Shatto, right, of beating little Max, left, to death in January . Keeping mum: The driveway to the Shatto family home, rear left, is seen in Gardendale, Texas, with a sign that reads: 'No Comment' The Shatto's attorney, Michael J. Brown, said he agreed ‘with the conclusion that it was an accidental . death and I've been saying it all along.’ ‘This is not a surprise to me at all,’ he said. The investigation into the boy's death . continues, Bland said. Once investigators complete their work, Bland . will meet with them and decide whether to pursue charges such as . negligent supervision or injury to a child by omission. Russian authorities and state-run . media have blamed the Shattos for Max's death and used the case as . justification for a recently enacted ban on all American adoptions of . Russian children. Russia's Investigative Committee has . said it has opened its own investigation. It's unclear whether the . committee could charge the Shatto family or force their prosecution. Alexander K. Zakharov, the Russian . consul general in Houston, said he wanted to see an official report from . authorities before commenting on Friday's announcement. Tragedy: Max Shatto, 3, died last month after being adopted by a family in Texas. Russian authorities are claiming he was abused . Russian born: Maxim was born the town of Pskov, near Russia's western border with Estonia. The boy lived with a family in Gardendale, Texas with his family before his death . U.S. State Department officials and adoption agency advocates have called for caution. The Russian government passed the ban . in December in retaliation for a new U.S. law targeting alleged Russian . human-rights violators. The ban also reflects lingering . resentment over the perceived mistreatment of some of the 60,000 . children Americans have adopted during the last two decades. At least 20 . of those children have died, and reports of abuse have garnered . attention in Russia. Chuck Johnson, CEO of the . Virginia-based National Council for Adoption, said an agreement ratified . last year would have prevented the conditions that led to many deaths . and abuse cases. One change in particular would have required all adoptions to go through agencies licensed in Russia. ‘The deaths were terribly tragic, . horrible,’ Johnson said in a February 19 interview. ‘But the frustrating . thing has been that those cases have become the face of inter-country . adoption, and they shouldn't be.’ The Texas Department of Family and . Protective Services said Friday it found no violations at the Gladney . Center for Adoption in Fort Worth, the agency that processed the . Shattos' adoption. The state's Child Protective Services . division is proceeding with a separate investigation into allegations . that Max was subject to physical abuse and neglect, but has not . determined whether those allegations are true. Parents: The boy's adoptive parents, Alan and Laura Shatto, denied knowing about the allegations being made by Russian authorities. No arrests have been made . Sad: The little boy, pictured right, was pronounced dead in hospital on Jan. 21 . Russian state media have featured the . boys' biological mother, 23-year-old Yulia Kuzmina, who lost custody . over negligence and addiction to alcohol. In a tightly choreographed February 21 . interview on state television, Kuzmina insisted Russian child services . officials seized her sons without her knowledge and said she wanted to . be reunited with her other son, born Kirill Kuzmin. She said she had given up drinking, . found a job and pledged to fight to get the boy back for fear that if he . stayed with his adoptive Texas family, he too will die like his . brother. . Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, has said it is necessary ‘to temper emotions’ over the case. On his part, U.S. Ambassador to Russia . Michael McFaul has called for ‘sensational exploitations of human . tragedy to end and for professional work between our two countries to . grow, on this issue and many others.’ Max's tragic death has received international attention in the wake of a recent Russian ban on all American adoptions. Russia's Investigative Committee said that it had opened an . investigation into the little boy's death. 'Three-year-old Maxim was beaten, . according to the investigators, by his adoptive mother, who fed him . psychoactive drugs over a long period of time, saying that he had some . psychiatric illness,' said Pavel Astakhov, the Russian Children's Rights . Commissioner alleges, according to The Telegraph. Plea: In a tightly choreographed interview, Max's biological mother, 23-year-old Yulia Kuzmina, tearfully appealed to President Putin to have her surviving son returned to her . Accusations: Pavel Astakho has alleged that Maxim was beaten to death by his American mother. American authorities have not confirmed the allegations are still investigating . He said the toddler had numerous bruises on his body and damage to organs. 'Our consuls must be allowed to see the materials of the case and take part in the formulation of the prosecution,' he added. Texas Child Protective Services spokesman Patrick Crimmins confirmed . the agency had received a report on Jan. 21 of the death of a three-year-old . named Max Shatto, and that the Ector County Sheriff's Office in West . Texas was investigating. Crimmins said CPS had received allegations of physical abuse and . neglect, but had not determined whether those allegations were true. An obituary for Max Shatto published Jan. 26 by the Midland . Reporter-Telegram says he was born on Jan. 9, 2010, in the town of . Pskov, near Russia's western border with Estonia. The boy lived with a . family in Gardendale, about 350 miles west of Dallas, before his death . on Jan. 21, according to the obituary. On the funeral home's website, . Max's parents wrote: 'Max, you were not with us long enough to leave . fingerprints on the walls but you left fingerprints upon our hearts.

Eileen Brown, 62, and Pete Emerton, 56, who are both retired, were walking the eight-year-old Labrador cross Sunday afternoon when Rosie got herself into the sticky situation. Rosie was playing in a field close to the couple's home in Beverley, East Yorkshire and ran to fetch a ball. But instead her attention was grabbed by a foot-long stick poking out of the ground and the pet playfully pounced on it. Freak accident: Rosie the dog was racing to get a ball and somehow managed to get impaled on a stick (outlined in red) Horrifyingly, the stick impaled her underneath her tongue and plunged down her throat. Ms Brown, a grandmother of two, said: 'Rosie had lost sight of a ball we had thrown for her. She then noticed a long stick, which was stuck in the ground at a 45 degree angle, and pounced on it. 'I quickly realised that she was impaled on the stick so I ran to her and wrenched it out of the ground to free her.' The couple contacted Kingston Vets and rushed her straight to their surgery in Hull. Bit more than a twig: The stick after it was recovered from the unfortunate dog's throat . 'It took us 30 minutes to drive to Hull and Rosie was obviously in a lot of pain because the stick was three inches wide and a foot long,"" said Eileen, who worked as a freelance writer, a part-time teacher and managed a furniture shop before she retired. 'Rosie is such a lovely natured dog and the vets couldn't believe it when she greeted them with a wagging tail.' Vet Paul Atkinson said: 'We anaesthetised Rosie so that we could take X-rays and assess the damage. 'We operated on her immediately to remove the stick, which was over a foot long, and stitched the wound under her tongue where the stick had gone in. 'Rosie has been very lucky because she could have damaged the muscles that are responsible for swallowing and could also have had complications from infection and splinters. 'We kept her in for two days and put her on antibiotics and pain relief and she has now made a good recovery.' Ms Brown added: 'Since the incident Rosie has made an excellent recovery. The swelling on her neck is almost gone and she's back to her old self. 'We have taken to calling her 'the black shadow' since it happened because she keeps following us everywhere. I think it has left her a little shaken and she keeps pining for us. 'She's not a young dog but she acts like a puppy and is daft as a brush. At one point it was touch and go and I just can't imagine what life would be like without her. Pete Emerton (pictured) and his Eileen Brown care for the eight-year-old Labrador cross for Ms Brown's daughter Nic . 'My daughter, Nic, owned her from when she was a puppy but since last October she's lived with me and Pete because Nic has been really busy with work. She's part of the family and we're delighted she's made a full recovery.' She added: 'I can't praise Kingston Vets enough. They had a team ready for us as soon as we got there and they gave us updates on Rosie's progress every couple of hours. 'They were so compassionate and if it wasn't for them, I'm not sure Rosie would have made it.'","The unlucky animal jumped onto the stick while out for a walk .

Henry Cornish, 11, winner of the open savoury junior category at the World Pasty Championships in Cornwall . What's in a name? Quite a lot, it turns out – at least when it comes to pasty making. Two brothers named Cornish have followed in their father's footsteps and triumphed at the World Pasty Championships. Henry Cornish, 14, won the open savoury junior category at the second annual event, held at the Eden Project in Cornwall. And his 11-year-old brother, Simon, came second in the Cornish pasty junior category. Their father Graham was crowned the winner in both the Cornish pasty and open savoury professional categories last year. Henry, of Launceston, Cornwall, said: 'I'm a bit surprised to be honest, I wasn't really expecting it because I entered just for fun but I'm really happy. 'My dad winning last year opened up my eyes so I thought that I would have a go this year. 'I did a pizza pasty because I absolutely love pizza so I thought why don't I try and make it into a pasty.' More than 125 professional and amateur bakers competed on Saturday and the winners across eight categories were announced at a ceremony dubbed the 'Oggy Oscars'. Defending champion Billy Deakin, from Mount Hawke, Cornwall, regained the champion spot in the Cornish pasty amateur category. Pasty lovers: Head judge Dave Meneer, right, with his team of judges at the pasty competition on Saturday . He said: 'It feels great to win, last year it was a bit of a surprise but this year I really wanted to win. 'I made the same pasty I always make at home and the judges obviously liked it as much as I do.' The championships also included pasty making workshops and demonstrations, with pop singer and cookery writer Paul Young among the special guests. Cornwall-born Mike Amery, who had flown from Pennsylvania, U.S., for the competition was presented with a special pasty ambassador award. Last year, Cornish pasties were given Protected Geographical Indication status by the European Commission. Savouring the moment: The world championship winners at the Eden Project, near St Austell . The status means only pasties made within the county are allowed to be labelled 'Cornish Pasty'. It followed a nine-year campaign by trade organisation, Cornish Pasty Association, which is made up of more than 50 pasty makers in Cornwall. Members of the association are estimated as being responsible for around six per cent of the area's food economy. Although its origins remain unclear, the pasty is first thought to have become popular in Cornwall in the 17th Century, with tin miners finding the food easy to carry and reheat, and eat without cutlery.

Heroes: Sir Alan Smith (right), pictured alongside fellow World War II hero Air Vice Marshall Johnnie Johnson (left) at a model aircraft rally in 2000, has died at the age of 95 . Sir Alan Smith, the wingman of World War II hero Sir Douglas Bader, has died aged 95. The pilot flew alongside Britain's most famous airman on several missions during the war, protecting him from enemy fire. After being personally selected by Sir Douglas to fly with him, Sir Alan was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross in 1941. With at least 20 confirmed kills, Sir Alan retired from the RAF in 1945 with more than 1,500 flying hours. On his first mission without his wingman, who had been grounded due to a bout of flu, Sir Douglas was shot down and captured by enemy troops. The pilot, who famously lost both his legs . in a pre-war air accident, was then held as a prisoner of war until the . conflict's end, despite a number of escape attempts. The father-of-five, who was knighted in 1982, died in Perth Royal Infirmary last Friday. He joined the RAF Voluntary Reserve just before the war, soon learning how to fly Tiger moths. But with only 14 hours of flight experience, he was called up to full-time duty and was flying Spitfires within a year. Previously describing his traingin, he said: 'The instructor merely pointed out the various levers, patted me on the back and said 'best of luck'.' He transferred to RAF Tangmere just one month before Sir Douglas arrived, personally selecting his longstanding wingman. Sir Alan said previously: 'He came into the . dispersal hut, got his eyes on me and said 'What's your name?' ''Smith, . sir,' I said. 'Right you'll do. Fly as my number two and God help you if . you let any Hun get on my tail'.' Hero: Sir Douglas Bader, one of Britain's most famous airmen, pictured during the war . Missions: Sir Douglas flew with Sir Alan as his Spitfire wingman on several occasions throughout the war. Sir Douglas crashed and was captured on his first mission without Sir Alan during the war . Capture: On his first mission without his wingman, who was forced to stay grounded due to flu, Sir Douglas was forced to land his plane in France and was captured by Nazis . He performed his duty until August 9 1941 when he was ordered to remain on the ground after falling ill - the same day Sir Douglas was forced to ground his plane over France, spending the next few years infuriating the . Nazis with his repeated escape attempts. Sir Alan was later posted to Balado aerodrome to train new pilots, where he met local woman Margaret Todd while she was working for the Women's Voluntary Service. The couple married in Kinross in 1943 and went on to have two daughters and three sons between 1945 and 1959. Born in South Shields, Tyne and Wear, he dropped out of school aged 14 to assist his mother Lilian after his father Captain Alfred Smith was lost at sea. He was the youngest of four sons, while his parents had also adopted a daughter. He eventually set up his own business selling sweets and tobacco after working as in an ironmongery with his mother for a year before joining the RAF. After his retirement from the airforce, Sir Alan settled in Kinrossshire, Scotland, to teach pilots and became active in the community. After the war ended he began working for his father-in-law Herbert Todd at the local woollen mill, Todd and Duncan Ltd. Under his management the company evolved into Dawson International Ltd. His youngest son Stuart said his father put his longevity down to hard work, self-discipline and a healthy lifestyle. He said he admired his father's generosity, fairness and integrity. Fighter: Sir Douglas Bader, who famously lost both his legs in an accident before the war, seen boarding an aircraft. He personally selected Sir Alan to be his wingman . Escapee: Sir Douglas Bader was sent to Colditz after several escape attempts, where he stayed until the end of the war . From the moment Sir Douglas Bader's plane crashed in 1931, it appeared he would be lucky to live, let alone fly again. While . trying low-flying aerobatics his aircraft crashed when the tip of the . left wing touched the ground and both his legs were amputated – one . above and one below the knee. But he wouldn't be deterred and managed to . rejoin the RAF in 1939 when war broke out and within two years he was a . squadron leader. In 1941 he . was shot down and captured in France. German forces treated Bader with . great respect. He lost his prosthetic leg when he bailed out and the . Germans allowed a new one to be dropped in by the British. From then came his series of escapes. He tried so many the Germans threatened to take away his legs. Bader . escaped from a hospital by tying together a number of sheets but was . betrayed by a hospital worker. After the war, the French authorities . sentenced the woman informer to 20 years in prison. In . 1942 he escaped with three others from Stalag Luft III only to be found . a few days later - the Germans were so concerned by his attempts they . produced a poster describing him and how he walked so the public could . spot him if he fled again. Finally he was sent to Colditz staying there until the end of the war - but he had tried his best to get out before then.","The two pilots flew on several missions together throughout World War II .

Comments: Gay rights campaigner Benjamin Cohen will make the comments, likening the experience of young gay men to that of Jesus on the cross, in a broadcast on Radio 4 later this week . The BBC is to broadcast an Easter message that likens the treatment of gay people to the death of Jesus. The talk, which will be broadcast on Radio 4, will compare the 'abandonment' felt by gay men and women to that experienced by Christ as he died on the cross. Former Channel 4 News presenter and gay rights campaigner Benjamin Cohen asks how people of faith can 'reject' their children 'for something they can't help'. Referring to Jesus's final moments on . the cross after being handed over to the Romans, Mr Cohen says that those from the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community often suffer similar experiences at the hands of religious groups. The . talk, which will be broadcast later this week, will feature as part of . the radio station's 'Lent Talk' series, focusing on the theme of . 'abandonment'. Mr Cohen, . who founded gay publisher Pink News, discusses his experience of growing . up in an Orthodox Jewish family and being educated in a Church of England . school. He will say that since coming out as gay, he has learned to view Jesus differently in light of his suffering. Mr . Cohen will argue that religion has been 'tearing families apart' and . says that parents' rejection of their child's sexuality due to religious . beliefs has driven many children to suicide. He . says: 'The feeling of abandonment by God in some ways has a resonance . with the words of Christ in both the Gospels of Mark and Matthew, where . he says, ‘My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?’' Mr Cohen adds: 'Of course, I . understand that for the very religious, it is difficult - an orthodox . Jew really does believe the Torah is the literal word of God and a . devout Catholic believes the Pope is infallible. Criticism: Andrea Williams, director of Christian Watch, likened the comparison to Jesus as 'blasphemous' and questioned the BBC's decision to broadcast the comments by Benjamin Cohen during Lent . 'But do people of faith really want to reject their children for something which I believe they can't help? 'Just as, the Jewish authorities rejected Christ - for something he considered he couldn't help- being the son of God?' The comments have drawn criticism from religious groups who described the comparison as 'blasphemous'. Andrea Williams, director of Christian . Concern, said: 'Whilst we have immense compassion for those who feel . rejection, to liken those who feel rejection because of behavioural . choices they have made to Jesus is blasphemous.' Miss Williams added: 'Jesus made high demands on how we are to behave particularly when it came to sexual expression, where he was clear that the only place for sexual expression is in the context of marriage between a man and a woman.' She said that the BBC's timing of the talk is a 'serious matter' and said that the broadcaster should be looking to ‘educate and inform’ a population she claims knows ‘increasingly little about Jesus’. In a related commentary for the Daily Telegraph, Mr Cohen criticises religious leaders for 'giving the impression that homosexuality is a choice'. He says: 'I can promise you, it's not a choice, no one would chose to be different, to be discriminated against and to risk being abandoned by their family and their faith. I tried to have a girlfriend.' Referring to Jesus being questioned on whether he was the Son of God, Mr Cohen adds: 'How different a situation is this to the questions and ultimatums given by some parents and some faiths to young gay people? Could Jesus have escaped his crucifixion by denying who he believed he really was?' Director of Christian Aid Loretta . Minghella also features in the Radio 4 series discussing selfishness, while . Scottish author Alexander McCall Smith talks about ageing. A BBC spokesman said: 'The theme of this year's Lent Talks is abandonment and features six well-known figures from public life, arts and religion.

A window cleaner who had an affair with a married woman killed himself after his friend posed as his ex-lover and bombarded him with texts as a 'childish prank', an inquest heard. Guilt-ridden Jeremy Brown, 38, stepped in front of a train on September 14 last year after receiving dozens of text messages claiming to be from his former mistress. Mr Brown, a self-employed window-cleaner from Evesham, in Worcestershire, had been cheating on his wife Sarah, 32, with a married woman before confessing to the affair last March. Tragic: Guilt-ridden Jeremy Brown, 38, stepped in front of a train last year after receiving dozens of text messages claiming to be from his former mistress . An inquest heard Mrs Brown agreed to take her husband back but said he received a series of text messages which had 'haunted' him and sent him 'downhill.' Before he came clean to his wife, Mr Brown confided in his best friend Grant Owen, who he had been friends with for 12 years. Just months after Mr Brown admitted to the affair, Mr Owen bought a new SIM card and sent him spoof text messages while he was drunk pretending to be from his ex-mistress. Giving evidence at the hearing at Worcester Coroner's Court, Mrs Brown said: 'The affair was over by the end of April and we had been working on the relationship. 'August had been a really good month but the texts sent Jeremy downhill. He would cry himself to sleep. 'He frantically tried to find out where they came from.' Mr Brown was so tormented by the texts he made two suicide attempts and even told his wife he would kill himself by throwing himself under a train. Mr Owen, 32, who now lives in Sheffield, told the inquest: 'For the first message I think we put something like, ""Hi this is my new number. Miss you"", then a kiss.' Mr Brown was so tormented by the texts he made two suicide attempts and even told his wife he would kill himself by throwing himself under a train . Mr Brown then replied 'Who is this?' before later asking if it was the woman he had been sleeping with. Mr Owen added: 'I think we sent back a kiss or ""yeah"". One or the other, or both.' After Mr Brown said he was going to bed Mr Owen wrote a message wishing him 'sweet dreams'. Worcestershire deputy coroner Marguerite Elcock launched an attack on Mr Owen after he insisted the texts were supposed to be a joke. She said: 'I am struggling to understand how you thought he would understand it was you and your friend messing about rather than the woman engaging in a romantic conversation.' It emerged today that Mr Brown, who had a two-year-old son with wife Sarah, discovered the text messages were a prank just days before he killed himself. Family friend Chris Furlong said: 'He realised that the texts were not being sent by her.'He found this out towards the end (of his life). 'Jeremy was very up when he and Sarah were making a go of it in the summer but in the last few weeks he was very down. 'Whether finding out the text messages were being sent as a joke sent him over the edge we will never know.' Neighbours of Mr Brown told yesterday how the popular window cleaner had fought to save his marriage to his wife. Sarah Brown, Jeremy's wife . One said: 'The couple were lovely, they obviously had their difficulties and I understand the other woman was a friend of Sarah's. 'It must have taken a lot for Sarah to forgive both her husband and her friend for betraying her but she wanted to make it work and I understand from talking to her that Jeremy wanted the same. 'To be getting these suggestive text messages must have sent Jeremy over the edge and messed with his mind. 'It is just so tragic that a stupid, playground joke has cost a man his life and a woman her husband.' Speaking after the inquest, Mrs Brown said: 'He was loved and will be missed by all the family and friends.' A post-mortem test has showed Mr Brown suffered multiple injuries and massive cerebral trauma but he had not been under the influence of either drugs or alcohol. Mr Brown ran a window cleaning business which he took over from his father Ernest, 73, when he retired. A jury returned a verdict of suicide.","Jeremy Brown had been cheating on his wife Sarah with a married woman .

Asked if he wants to see the ‘Special One’ back at Stamford Bridge, the Blues goalkeeper said: ‘We had a fantastic success with him, so why not? He is a fantastic manager.’ Chelsea fans united to sing Mourinho’s name during Saturday’s 1-0 home win against West Bromwich Albion and Cech said: ‘Of course, I understand that. Jose Mourinho did a fantastic job for the club and people loved him so he rightly deserved that. This is the way it should be.’ VIDEO: Scroll down to watch match highlights . Eye on the ball: Petr Cech sees no harm in the way Chelsea are run . And Cech also spoke out in support of . the Chelsea way, defending the right of senior players to have their . say and the right of owner Roman Abramovich to hire and fire as he sees . fit. The goalkeeper is the first . voice from the dressing room to speak publicly since last week’s . training-ground spat between senior players and Rafa Benitez. Two . days later, Benitez took a swipe at the decision to employ him under . the title of interim manager, suggesting it had undermined his . authority, and confirmed he will definitely leave when his contract . expires at the end of the season. ‘We do it our way, the other clubs do it their way, and it seems to work so far, so long may it continue,’ said Cech, who arrived at Chelsea in 2004 and has played under eight of Abramovich’s nine managers. ‘You can argue with a lot of things but in the same period of time we won more or less the same number of trophies as Manchester United. Stalwart: The goalkeeper has been a key figure since his 2004 arrival . ‘They had one manager, we had eight, and we won the same  trophies. We won the Champions League, there are so many positives. ‘Arsenal . had the same manager and it is a long time since they won something. You can’t always say that is the fault of the manager or the players. Maybe if you asked them if they would rather have 10 managers and six . trophies, I don’t know what they would say.’ Since . Mourinho built his title-winning team at Chelsea, the senior players in . the dressing room have developed a formidable reputation for the power . they wield and they have never been afraid to take on the manager if . they feel something ought to be said. ‘We had a lot of success thanks to the honesty and open mind everyone has in the dressing room,’ said Cech. ‘Everybody should have a chance to express an opinion, and if the players are not happy in our dressing room, it is not the case that we say, “Unlucky mate, we will carry on, you pick yourself up”. ‘No. If someone is not happy we try to help them to be happy again and to be at the top. This is why, when we see something is going wrong, people have the right to say, “We think this is wrong, we should improve that, we need to try to find a different solution”. ‘It is important for the manager to know the feedback. But there is only one boss and that is the manager. Miserable: Benitez's spell at Chelsea has been an unhappy one . ‘It is up to him if he wants to listen to what the players say or find his own way through.’ Chelsea . beat West Bromwich Albion 1-0 at Stamford Bridge, easing the pressure . on Benitez by keeping the club on track for a top-four finish. ‘On . Saturday, you could see from the start we took control of the game and . we created chances. The only problem was that we did not finish the game . off,’ added Cech. ‘There are things we are still not doing well but that is a normal  situation when you bring in a  new manager. It needs some time to gel. ‘The club took Rafa Benitez because they wanted to improve the situation and achieve the targets we had at the beginning of the season. He is here to do his best and to help us as much as he can. ‘As players, we must do the same: try to win games; work hard; move forward; achieve the targets. As a club, everyone should have the same feeling, no matter how long they’ve been here. We are the  Chelsea Football Club and we should be united: the players, the fans, the manager, his coaching staff, the board, everybody to achieve the targets.’ Hostility: Chelsea fans have never accepted Benitez's appointment . Intelligent and articulate, Cech has become the public voice of the dressing room this season. He . exhibits the mental strength and confidence typical of Chelsea’s senior . players, a by-product of the success achieved by Mourinho, who won five . major trophies in three years at Stamford Bridge. Mourinho . arrived in 2004 and masterminded the club’s first title in half a . century before successfully defending it. He also won the FA Cup and . League Cup twice before a breakdown in his working relationship with . owner Abramovich. He was sacked in September 2007. The pair are understood to have reconciled many of their differences, although Abramovich still has reservations about the prospect of a return. There was no major anti-Benitez protest on Saturday, but there were several banners displayed at  the game by Chelsea fans making their views clear on the interim manager. Returning? Jose Mourinho remains a hugely popular figure at Chelsea . One said: ‘Divided We Fall Rafa Out’, another said: ‘The Interim One’ and another said: ‘We’re Just Not That Interim’. Benitez . said: ‘We had to produce a good game and we did it. The players enjoyed . it, the fans were behind the team. Everything was positive. ‘What . will happen in the next week, I don’t know. I’m really pleased after . winning, without thinking what will happen in the future.’ Despite the success with a revolving-door policy on the manager’s office, Cech would like to see the next manager given more time. ‘I have been saying that for six years,’ said Cech. ‘I hope the new manager will find the momentum and he will stay. ‘I’ve been here a long time and I’ve seen so many things that I don’t get surprised any more.’","Manager did a fantastic job at the Bridge, says goalkeeper .

Clutching her young daughter in her arms, the widow of a film director mauled to death by a great white shark stands on the same beach where, days before, her husband was dragged beneath the waves as he swam off the shore. Adam Strange, 46, was attacked by the enormous shark off New Zealand's Muriwai beach last Wednesday. His wife Meg returned to the scene of the horror attack north of Auckland with the couple's daughter, Indigo. Muriwai had been closed to swimmers in the wake of the tragedy, but re-opened at the weekend. Bereaved: Megan Strange brought her daughter to the reopening of Muriwai Beach, days after her husband was attacked by a shark off the shore . A funeral service for Mr Strange, 46, will take place today at the beach, which is close to the family's home. Up to 1,000 people are expected to . attend the service. Muriwai Lifeguard Service chair Tim Jago told the New Zealand Herald the ceremony would be 'upbeat' and 'quirky'. 'As Adam is taken out of Muriwai for one last time, I think there is going to be a fairly entertaining, theatrical departure for him,' he said. Lifeguards and police had battled in vain to save Mr Strange when he was targeted by the great white shark as he swam just 200 yards from the shore on Wednesday afternoon. Mr Strange had waved and called for help as the creature dragged him . underwater to the horror of witnesses on Muriwai. Police fired 20 shots at the killer shark in a desperate rescue attempt. Up to four other . sharks, attracted by blood in the water, are understood to have joined in the attack, which occurred at around 1.30pm. Final goodbyes: The day after the attack Mrs Strange was comforted by a friend at the beach, where her husband's funeral will take place today .

He said Mr Strange had appeared to struggle with the shark before it swam away – and then it, and  others, came back. Mr Mose called the police on his mobile while a friend ran for help. He said: ‘He was still alive. He put his head up. We called him to swim over the rock to where we were. ‘He raised his hand up and then while he was raising his hand we saw another attack pull him in.’ Mr Mose said that as blood filled the water, three or four more sharks arrived. The fishermen were forced to watch as the shark carried the man’s body out to sea. ‘It’s awful – like a nightmare. I was shaking, scared, panicked.’ Scroll down for video .

A man dubbed 'Britain’s most feckless father' after fathering 17 children by 15 different mothers is facing life behind bars after he convicted of murdering a man in brutal knife attack. Jamie Cumming stabbed James Getty to death outside The Maltman pub in Dundee’s Mains Road - causing 'lethal' injuries to his heart, lungs and liver. He denied the attack - which took place in front of a string of witnesses - and tried to shift the blame onto a mutual friend of his and Mr Getty’s. But a jury took just two hours to reject Cumming’s story and convict him of murdering Mr Getty by a majority verdict. After the verdict was delivered, advocate depute Gillian Wade told the court that Cumming had 19 previous convictions - including one for assault to injury. And she added: 'The accused is in a relationship and has three children from that union. 'But it is believed he has another 13 children from various other relationships.' A nine-day trial at the High Court in Dundee heard how Cumming had clashed with Mr Getty in the toilets of The Maltman bar during a mutual friend’s 50th birthday party. Mr Getty was seen with blood coming from a wound above his eye as he left the toilets - before he followed Cumming outside the pub, where a 'scuffle' broke out. The fight moved into neighbouring Mid Road, with James Kelbie - who’s 50th birthday the pair had been attending - getting between the pair trying to 'separate' them. Witnesses told the court they then saw Cumming repeatedly strike Mr Getty in the chest in a 'stabbing motion'. He was then seen to 'stagger' backwards with a 'stunned' look and blood 'gushing' from his chest. Mr Getty walked back into Mains Road . before collapsing, with Mr Kelbie trying to put pressure on his wounds . as an ambulance rushed to the scene. The . court heard that Mr Getty suffered 'lethal' stab wounds to his heart, . lungs and liver - and 'would have died even if he had been stabbed in . the hospital car park', according to a medical examiner.He died around an hour and a half after the attack at Dundee’s Ninewells Hospital. Jamie Cumming with Alison McPhee who has had three children with him. Also in the picture are his daughter Samantha (now aged 16) and on Adam (now aged 10) Meanwhile, Cumming fled, jumping into . a taxi and making his way to meet notorious Dundee underworld figure . George Kerr - who has links to Glasgow gangster Paul Ferris. Kerr . later burned Cumming’s blood spattered t-shirt, and told the court he . drove Cumming around various streets in Dundee while Cumming sat with a . snake around his neck. Cumming . sent a string of texts to former partners in the minutes after the . attack - telling Chelsea Anderson, 21, the mother of his 16th child, who . was born in November 2011, that 'it wasnae for nothing'. Jamie Cumming was dubbed Britain's most feckless father' after having 17 children by 15 different mothers. He is now facing life behind bars . He told another that he had 'done someone'. Cumming was arrested the following day, on June 2 last year, in his grandfather’s car - with a bag containing his bloodstained shoes and clothes. He told cops 'I’ve thrown my life away' as they took him to Tayside Police HQ in Dundee city centre. A forensic examination of his clothes found Mr Getty’s blood inside the pockets of his jeans and inside his shirt. Cumming, 36, a prisoner at HMP Perth, denied that he had murdered James Getty by repeatedly striking him on the body with a knife or similar instrument. Cumming has lodged a special defence of incrimination on the murder charge, alleging that James Kelbie committed the crime. But a jury of eight men and seven women took just over two hours to find him guilty of murder by majority. Donald Findlay QC, defending, said he would reserve his plea in mitigation until a later sentencing date. Judge Lady Clark of Calton said Cumming faces a life sentence when he appears at the High Court in Edinburgh on April 3. She said: 'The penalty for murder is of course prescribed by law. 'But I require a report before I can sentence.' Cumming showed no emotion as the verdict was read - but bowed his head as he was led in handcuffs to the cells. No-one from either family made any comment as they left the court. Jamie Cumming was first branded 'Britain’s most feckless father' in late 2011 after it emerged he had fathered 16 children by 14 different mothers. But now he will miss the younger years of all those children as he faces life in prison over the murder of James Getty outside the Maltman pub in Dundee on June 1 last year. Cumming’s profligate procreation came to light when his mother, Lorraine, launched a scathing attack on his bedhopping antics. She said: 'We don’t speak to each other, and, even though I love him as my child, I am bitterly disappointed with how he lives his life. 'It’s difficult to keep up with it all, but I do my best to see all the kids. 'He just doesn’t seem bothered, even though he thinks he’s ""Father of the Year"" because he lives with three of them. 'It’s sad he doesn’t see his eldest who I have looked after since she was born. 'The girls he is running around with just now are not much older than her - he just loves teenagers.'I would say he is a sexual predator.' Cumming was just 17 when his first daughter was born in 1995, but once the baby arrived he moved his affections to the mum's cousin. The baby was left with Cumming’s parents to raise as their own, and the daughter has seen her own mother only twice since. Between 1997 and 2002, Cumming then fathered another five children with five different mothers. In 2004, he had two girls and a boy who were all born within months of each other, and between December 2007 and August 2008 the former barman fathered three more offspring. The only woman Cumming has had more than one child with is an on-off girlfriend - they have three children together. She gave birth to his 14th child in July 2010, and he became a father for the 15th time in November 2011 when a teenager he had a brief fling with gave birth to a baby boy. Chelsea Anderson, 21, had his 16th child later that month. She gave evidence against him during his murder trial, telling the court he had written to her: 'It wasnae for nothing - I was in a mood and he was being a prick.' And his 17th was born in early 2012 to another teenage mum, who has not been identified. Cumming defended his behaviour - claiming he was following the Bible commandment to 'go forth and multiply'. He said: 'I’ve sat in loads of bars over the years and heard people moaning about the population falling in Dundee. 'I’ve been doing my best to repopulate the town. 'I’ve done my bit, but I know that on Judgement Day, I might pay for my sins.' Cumming added: 'Contraception is a two-way thing. If women are going to have sex with me and don’t want a baby, why don’t they take the Pill? 'I’m a big boy, 6ft 4in, well-built and I’m in proportion. 'I know they’re supposed to make condoms for larger men these days, but I’ve not found one yet. 'The reality is all these women have been happy to have my babies. 'Maybe some of them thought I was a good catch. Others believed I’d settle down with them. 'I never promised them anything.'","Jamie Cumming stabbed James Getty to death outside a bar in Dundee .

Some residents have found the dye - described as completely 'non toxic' - has turned their shoes green as they walk across the city's newly spruced up municipal lawns, the Telegraph reports. Mr Yang, a salesman for Top Green, the makers of the dye, told the paper: 'We have been selling it to the Chengdu government for at least five or six years, and we have lots of other government clients, like the city of Tianjin, and many north western provinces.' The company website claims it lasts for ten to 14 weeks, is not washed away by the rain, and also turns the soil green. Officials have said people feel more 'positive, cheerful and productive when Spring is here and everything is green and new' The landscaping department has declined to comment on the use of the dye. But they told Chinese journalists that the chemical was a type of nutrient used to help keep the grass alive during winter. It is not the first time China has gone to lengths to improve the country's aesthetic appearance. In the past fields of crops have been replanted to give a more 'fertile appearance' during an inspection tour of the countryside by Chairman Mao, and fake sheep have been positioned on the dried out grasslands of Inner Mongolia to dupe tourists that the animals were still grazing there.","In south-western city Chengdu officials have been painting the verges .

Siobhain McDonagh,Mr Azis's MP, told the Commons he needs Viagra to stay alive as the drug dilates his arteries to carry blood to his muscles . A father-of-three faces an early death unless he is prescribed the erectile dysfunction drug Viagra to treat his lung disease, a Labour MP claimed today. Siobhain McDonagh told the Commons her constituent Liaquat Aziz needs the stimulant as he suffers from lung and cardiac disease. The 61-year-old’s doctors insist he faces an early death unless he is prescribed the drug, which is usually used to treat erectile dysfunction. Mr Aziz’s arteries are currently too narrow and the drug dilates them so that they can carry more oxygen to his muscles. But Merton and Sutton Primary Care Trust are threatening to withdraw treatment from Mr Aziz as it will cost £5,000 and the drug should not necessarily be prescribed, according to national guidelines. It is up to the discretion of individual PCTs if they prescribe the drug. Speaking in the Commons, Mitcham and Morden MP Ms McDonagh said her repeated calls for meetings with the trust have not been answered. She said the cost of his inevitable hospital treatment without the drug would cost the NHS more money than the Viagra itself. She said: 'Here is a man who could die without this drug and the bosses at Merton and Sutton Primary Care Trust cannot even deign to talk to his MP. 'Mr Aziz is a good man. He has an extraordinary medical history. He is a testament to our NHS but he needs a tablet that most people, if they are honest, think is a bit of a joke drug. 'He needs Viagra. It’s not for recreational purposes, it is to stay alive and my local NHS would rather let him suffer than let him have the only drug that works on him. Viagra helps by elevating the levels of the chemical that causes the tissues in the body to relax. The effects on erectile function were discovered accidentally - it was originally developed to improve blood supply to the heart in angina sufferers. It is prescribed for patients such as Mr Aziz, who have restricted blood flow, because it's artery-widening properties mean blood can get to the muscles that need it. However its effect on the arteries can also have negative effects: patients who take the drug may suffer from flushed skin. It can also cause headaches and nausea. 'It would cost thousands of pounds a day to look after him in hospital but they won’t spend £5,000 to keep him out. My local NHS has behaved appallingly to him and have treated me and my office with a basic lack of respect. 'We all know the NHS is facing pressures that it hasn’t had to face before, but in this case Viagra is not a sex tablet, it is a life-saver.' Speaking outside the Commons, Mr Aziz, a retired engineer from Merton, said he was angry at the decision to potentially withdraw the drug. His battle with the NHS started two years ago when he was prescribed Viagra. It worked successfully, but then the PCT said it should be withheld. He managed to successfully overturn the decision and get a prescription for half the original amount. But the PCT is now threatening to withdraw it again. Mr Aziz said: 'I cannot believe it. I feel angry because I have been working for 30 years and paid my National Insurance and income tax and now I cannot get the medicine that I need. 'My family is also very stressed as we are getting letters saying now I can have it, now I can’t. They are not sure what will happen. 'You have to wonder what is the point of having professional doctors if you are not going to listen to them. They are educated people and are prescribing the medicine for a reason, they are not doing it for a joke or for fun.' Public Health minister Anna Soubry said it was the PCT's discretion whether he received the treatment . Health Minister Anna Soubry said she would be happy to attend a meeting between the PCT, Mr Aziz and his MP, Ms McDonagh, who represents Mitcham and Morden. The minister said the Government’s health reforms to abolish PCTs will mean GPs have the final say when it comes to prescribing drugs to patients. But she said guidance from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice), which stated Viagra should not be handed out automatically for Mr Aziz’s condition, meant that it was at the discretion of the PCT whether he received the treatment. Ms Soubry said: 'I have to say, looking at what I have been told by the PCT, (Mr Aziz) has been through all the sorts of processes that you would expect. 'I have to hope and pray that in the course of all of that, and the various effective appeals he has made to the PCT, everything has been properly considered. 'But it just strikes me that the most obvious thing that should have been done, hasn’t been done. 'Nobody seems to have sat Mr Aziz down and explained things to him. 'If there is a good reason, then he should be told that and if it is just the money, then again we know exactly what the problem is. 'Therefore what I am going to suggest is that those who might be listening, whether it be in this building or whether they are at the other end of a television camera, should sit down with this man and discuss the way forward for his treatment.'","Liaquat Aziz needs the stimulant as he suffers from lung and heart disease .

Children suffering from attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are often dismissed as difficult youngsters who are over-treated. But new research suggests that for many sufferers, the condition can continue long into adulthood and increases their chances of developing other psychiatric conditions, too. The data also reveals children with ADHD are more likely to commit . suicide or to be jailed as adults. Children with ADHD often find it difficult to settle to tasks . The neuro-developmental disorder affects . seven per cent of children and affects more boys than girls. Those with ADHD are easily . distracted, find it difficult to sit still and can act without thinking of the consequences. The research, from the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, is the first large, population-based study to follow children with ADHD into adulthood. Lead author Dr William Barbaresi, said: 'Only 37.5 percent of the children we contacted as adults were free of . these really worrisome outcomes. 'That's a sobering . statistic that speaks to the need to greatly improve the long-term . treatment of children with ADHD and provide a mechanism for treating . them as adults.' INATTENTIVENESS . Short attention span, easily distracted, appearing forgetful, unable to concentrate . HYPERACTIVITY . Unable to sit still, fidgeting, excessive talking and movement . IMPULSIVENESS . Acting without thinking, little sense of danger, unable to wait patiently . The study, published in the journal Pediatrics, followed more than 5,000 children born from 1976 to 1982 in Rochester, Minnesota. This included 367 who were diagnosed with ADHD, 232 of whom participated in the follow-up study when they were adults. The scientists found that 29 per cent of the affected children still had ADHD as adults. Of the children who still had ADHD . as adults, 81 per cent had at least one other psychiatric disorder, as . compared with 47 per cent of those who no longer had ADHD and 35 per cent . of controls. The scientists found that seven of the 367 children with ADHD (1.9 . per cent) had died at the time of study recruitment, three of them from . suicide. Of the 4,946 children without ADHD whose outcomes could be . ascertained, only 37 children had died (0.7 per cent), five by suicide. Ten children with ADHD (2.7 per cent) in jail at the time of the follow-up study. Dr Barbaresi said ADHD was not just a childhood condition . Dr Barbaresi said: 'We suffer from the misconception that ADHD is just an annoying childhood disorder that's overtreated. 'This couldn't be further from the truth. We need to have a chronic disease approach to ADHD as we do for diabetes. The system of care has to be designed for the long haul.'

'One can argue that this is potentially a best-case scenario,' he said. 'Outcomes could be worse in socioeconomically challenged populations.'

Former barman David Kean, 41, moved into their homes and then left with jewellery, computers and cars totalling £8,000. A court heard that he invented a new name and identity whenever he contacted a fresh victim and managed to keep up the ruse for three years. Kean used 19 aliases and five dates of birth to carry out his fraud. Judge Ebrahim Mooncey jailed Kean for three years at Derby Crown Court and told him: 'You wormed your way into their lives. 'The effect on victims are that they say ""my trust in mankind has gone as a result of what I experienced with him."" 'You breached their trust and did it without emotion. It was spiteful and mean.' Outside court, victim Catherine Smith, from County Durham, said: 'I have not seen him for three years and was glad to see him through bars. 'He told me his favourite meal was steak and ale pie. I bought one and he stole that from the fridge. 'He took my daughter Hannah's £180 birthday money and my car.

Amjed Iqbal, 35, and Shakir Javid  36, from Fenham, Newcastle pleaded guilty to charges for their accident claims company at Newcastle Crown Court. Their business Accident and Claims Specialists (ACS) targeted taxis and owned several licensed taxis which they would hire to taxi drivers whose cars were off the road. Iqbal and Javid made thousands from insurance companies by making up accidents and costs. Elaborate frauds: Amjed Iqbal, left, and Shakir Javid, right, from Newcastle made money from false insurance claims and mortgage fraud . Newcastle Crown Court heard that between 2006 and 2009, they made 34 false claims, amounting to £194,000. It was not until Arriva Buses became suspicious about a claim they made that police investigated them. Prosecutor Michael Graham said: 'In some claims, there is evidence that no accident took place at all, in others sums have been claimed for recovery, storage or hire when this did not take place or otherwise, figures have been inflated.' They also provided a number of taxi drivers with fake insurance certificates, leaving them uninsured. Police found some of the taxis had even been registered as hired to more than one person at the same time. In all 38 forged insurance documents were recovered from their Newcastle offices, most of which had been lodged by unsuspecting taxi drivers. Officers discovered that Iqbal and Javid had also lined their pockets with mortgage frauds. Javid obtained 11 mortgage advances with £919,496 by using his wife's name and making false declarations about his income.

In 2009 Iqbal was shot in the leg at a house in Ponteland when he was targeted by masked gunmen. Javid and another man were initially accused of the attack, however charges were later dropped. Iqbal underwent two operations to remove 50 pellets embedded in his leg. After the shooting, Javid ran ACS from new premises while Iqbal stayed at the old shop running a rival business. Andrew Rutter, the lawyer who was defending Iqbal, said: 'He is vulnerable physically, part of his arm is missing and he now has a cage around his leg. He is a devoted family man and devout religiously.' Robin Patton, acting for Javid, said: 'There is a good side to him, he has tried to help others who are less fortunate.

A second secret autopsy was performed on tragic country singer Mindy McCready after her untimely death, leading to speculation that drugs may have played a part in her suicide, it was revealed today. According to The National Enquirer, McCready’s body went on a bizarre trip from the autopsy slab to an Arkansas funeral home and back to the coroner’s lab before being shipped to her native Florida for the funeral, which took place yesterday. 'Right after the coroner released Mindy’s body to a funeral home in Arkansas, they suddenly demanded that it be sent back to the coroner’s office for ""additional tests"",' a source told the Enquirer.

Mindy McCready's emotional funeral took place in Fort Myers, the Florida city where she was born and raised today . 'No one knows what those tests involved but it was a very unusual request as it delayed sending her body for burial.' The mother-of-two shot herself on the porch of her Heber Springs, Arkansas home almost a month after her boyfriend David Wilson did the same thing. She had just checked out of rehab where she was ordered into a mental health substance abuse program after admitting in court she had 'indulged in too much alcohol' trying to cope with her boyfriend's death. There has been speculation she was put on medication while she was in the facility, some of which may have pushed her to the edge - as some antidepressants may cause or increase suicidal thoughts. Dr Lawrence Kobilinsky - who did not treat McCreary - told the Enquirer: 'Mindy's body was most likely called back for additional toxicology testing. We don't know what medication she may have been prescribed while under involuntary commitment or an outpatient treatment program.' Around 400 people attended the 2pm funeral service yesterday which was opened to the public at the Crossroads Baptist Church in Fort Myers.

David Cameron told MPs the government is considering a ban on smoking in cars, expanding the ban in public places and insisting on plain cigarette packs . The Prime Minister is considering a ban on smoking in cars when children are present. David Cameron said there had been a ‘real health advance’ with restrictions on smoking in public places and those wanting to go further had a ‘good point’. He said other options included mandatory plain packaging, recently introduced in Australia. The intervention comes 24 hours after health minister Anna Soubry backed the idea of a ban in cars. She said lighting up on the road was a ‘child welfare issue’ and called on the Government to consider making it illegal. At Prime Minister's Questions Mr Cameron was urged by Labour's Ian Mearns to go 'a significant step further and introduce a ban on smoking when children are present in vehicles'. Mr Cameron replied: 'We should look carefully at what the you and others have said. 'We are looking across the piece at all the issues, including whether we should follow the Australians with the ban on packaging and what more we can to do to restrict smoking in public places. 'There has been a real health advance from some of the measures that have been taken. 'We must consider each one and work out whether there is a real public health benefit, but you make a good point.' Health groups have called for a cigarette ban in cars for years as the confined space means the toxic fumes other passengers breathe in are up to 11 times more concentrated. Dr Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, backed the PM: 'The case for a ban on smoking in cars is now unarguable. 'Since the BLF began this campaign in 2010, we've had overwhelming support from the public, from politicians - and now from the Government's own health minister. 'Unfortunately, since then, children's exposure to second-hand smoke has resulted in 800,000 primary care consultations, 440,000 new episodes of disease and 25,000 hospital admissions.' Yesterday Miss Soubry, a junior minister for public health, became the first frontbencher to suggest it, although she stressed this was her own opinion not Government policy. ‘I would ban smoking in cars where children are present’, she told the Local Government Association’s annual public health conference yesterday. ‘I would do that for the protection of children. I believe in protecting children. I would see it as a child welfare issue. I think it is something we should at least consider as a government. The minister would need to convince David Cameron who said he backed the ban on smoking in public places (posed by models) Miss Soubry, Tory MP for Broxtowe in Nottinghamshire has courted controversy for her outspoken views on people’s lifestyles. Last month she said children from poor backgrounds were more likely to be obese due to an ‘abundance of bad food’. However research from a US university published shortly afterwards . suggested in fact middle class children were more likely to be fat. She has also described the current laws on assisted dying as ‘appalling’. A survey by the Department of Health last year found that more than one in five smokers lit up in front of their children in the home or in the car. Around 300,000 children in the UK visit the GP each year due to second-hand smoke, with 9,500 visiting hospital. It has been against the law to smoke in vehicles solely used for work, such as pool cars or lorries, since July 2007, a year after smoking in pubs, clubs and restaurants was banned. While the government are not currently considering a ban, they have run marketing campaigns encouraging people not to smoke in front of their children at home or in the car. Anna Soubry is the first frontbencher to suggest the proposal . The anti-smoking charity Ash said there is ‘growing public support for a ban on smoking in cars altogether.’ Martin Dockrell, its policy advisor said: . ‘The minister can count on our support and the majority of the public. A ban on smoking in cars is the right thing to do. We need to think about whether this should just be aimed at children. Older adults are vulnerable too.’ South Africa has banned smoking in cars as have some parts of Canada, the US and Australia. The British Medical Association and Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health also back a ban. Second hand smoke is particularly damaging to babies and children as their smaller lungs will breathe in relatively larger doses of smoke than adults, and their immune systems are still developing. It is associated with asthma, ear infections, pneumonia and even cot death. Research has found children who breathe in smoke are more likely to get cancer in later life. Last year the House of Lords approved plans to ban smoking in cars, by handing offenders a £60 fine or forcing them to attend a smoke awareness course. But they acknowledged ministers prefered education to try and convince parents to change their behaviour. David Cameron suggested it would curtail personal freedoms, and said parliament needed to have a ‘serious think’ before taking such a step. Labour MP Alex Cunningham introduced legislation urging a ban in the Commons last year but it faced significant opposition from MPs of all parties.","PM reveals idea is part of plan to improve public health .

Wakefield Magistrates Court heard that the children were 'upset and distressed'. Andy Wills, prosecuting, told how a breath test of Stenson, from Crigglestone, West Yorkshire, revealed 171mcgs in 100mls of breath. At the police station she tested 151mcgs in 100mls of breath - while the legal limit is 35mcgs. Chairman of the bench Stuart Swallow said: 'The reading that was gathered was one of the highest I have ever come across, and that's something.' Stenson pleaded guilty to drink driving at an earlier hearing in February, and this week was handed a three-year driving ban. Roger Clapham, defending, told magistrates that Stenson had been having 'marital problems', financial problems and that she had recently lost her grandmother and had consumed half a bottle of vodka on the day of the incident.

But it is a 'recipe for disaster' when done while attempting a tricky right-hand turn into oncoming traffic, according to scientists. Scans showed that performing simple tasks, such as driving straight, resulted in minimal brain activation, while undertaking a difficult manoeuvre needed the most brain power. Danger: Using a mobile while driving is now illegal in the UK (photo posed by model) Researchers found the activity in parts of the brain that deal with vision and decision-making - needed to tackle a right-hand turn - is 'significantly reduced' when chatting. The Canadian research team said the results have 'important implications regarding distracted driving' and the use of hands-free car kits. 'Our findings suggest that the distracted brain sacrificed areas important for visual attention and alertness to recruit enough brain resources to perform a secondary, cognitive task [speaking],' the report concluded. Lead author Dr Tom Schweizer, director at St Michael Hospital's Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute in Toronto, said when British drivers perform a right turn while talking, it 'could be the most dangerous thing they ever do on the road'. He said: 'In theory, turning right is the most difficult aspect of driving in Britain, because you having to consider oncoming traffic, traffic lights, and if pedestrians are crossing in the lane you are turning into. 'With hands-free kits, despite the fact that you are not holding on to a device, you are still being distracted from the primary task of driving. There is only so much brain resources available. Use your head: Brain scans revealed that chatting, whether or not it was on the phone, affected drivers' abilities to react (photo posed by model) 'In crude terms, when we are talking, parts of the visual system shut down to allow the communications system to come on line. So less of our brain is devoted to the task of driving.' The research, published in the journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, involving testing 16 young drivers who were operating a driving simulator equipped with a steering wheel, brake pedal and accelerator inside an MRI brain scanner. This allowed them to map in real time which parts of the brain were activated or deactivated as the simulator took participants through increasingly difficult driving manoeuvres. Tasks included making turns at intersections with or without oncoming traffic or driving with distractions that mimicked talking on a hands free mobile phone or engaging in a conversation with a passenger. 'This study provides real-time neuroimaging evidence supporting previous behavioural observations suggesting that multitasking while driving may compromise vision and alertness. Hands free not does mean brains free,' said Dr Schweizer. 'We have finite resources, and when we begin a discussion, the brain starts to shift resources. But you need all these resources to carry out a complicated driving manoeuvre safely. 'The brain data showed that a distraction really does reduce the brain's ability to react drastically.' The scientists warned that car manufacturers may also have to reconsider the design of vehicles, which increasingly have in-built devices that can be a distraction to drivers. The report found: 'Automobile manufacturers also have a responsibility to improve safety by refraining from installing various communication devices in vehicles, or by installing deactivation systems if drivers attempt to use the devices while the car is in motion.'","Canadian research team called chatting while driving a 'recipe for disaster'

A lorry driver who killed a young girl in a horrific motorway crash after ignoring speed limit signs has been jailed for four-and-a-half years today. Robert Booth, 64, pleaded guilty this month to causing the death of four-year-old Priyanka Bhogal by dangerous driving despite initially denying the offence. Priyanka, from Coventry, died of a head injury after Booth’s heavy goods vehicle smashed into the back of her mother’s Vauxhall Zafira on the M6 in November 2011. Robert Booth (right) was jailed for four and a half years after his HGV ploughed into the back of a family car killing Priyanka Bhogal (left), four. He had ignored overhead warning signs to slow down on the M6 . Signs leading up to the site of the accident near Coleshill, Warwickshire, had reduced the speed limit to 40mph and even 20mph because of slow-moving traffic. But Booth’s lorry was later found to . have been travelling at its 'limited' top speed of around 55mph until . moments before it came to a halt. Sentencing Booth, of Town End Farm, . Sunderland, Judge Sylvia De Bertodano accepted he had led an 'entirely . blameless' life before to the tragedy. Warwick Crown Court heard Booth, a . married father-of-four, was of previous good character and had received . 'not so much as a speeding conviction' while working as a lorry driver . for 42 years. Booth, who has eight grandchildren, . had also developed a depressive illness since the accident, as well as . suffering from a heart condition and caring for his wife. During her sentencing remarks, Judge . De Bertodano told Booth: 'Nothing in your past can possibly have . prepared you for finding yourself in the position that you are in today. 'I have no doubt about your remorse . but nothing you can do, and nothing that I can do, can take away the . pain that Priyanka’s family suffer and will continue to suffer for the . rest of their lives.' Seven other people were also injured in the crash between Junctions 4a and 4 of the southbound M6 at 12:25am on November 27, 2011- which saw the motorway closed for more than six hours (file picture) Imposing a five-year driving ban, the . judge told Booth: 'It was a sustained period of driving for what must . have been several minutes, during which you ignored the traffic signs . which clearly reduced the advisory speed limit to 40mph and then made . that limit mandatory. 'You also ignored the fact that vehicles ahead were slowing down - the red brake lights described by other drivers. 'Despite all this you maintained a . speed limit at the top level available to your vehicle. Whether asleep . or awake you were in your own little world and utterly unaware of what . was going on outside your cab.' Two other members of Priyanka’s . family, including her aunt and eight-year-old sister, suffered serious . injuries when the near-stationary Zafira was 'punted' into a concrete . barrier at about 12.25am. Priyanka was sitting in the rearmost near side seat and was sitting on a booster seat. The Bhogal family had . been driving home to Coventry after a family member's 40th birthday . party the previous day in Walsall, West Midlands. The car, which had slowed down with . its hazard lights flashing, was struck despite 'obvious' overhead gantry . signs warning of a problem ahead. Booth pleaded guilty on the second day . of a trial at which he claimed he may have fallen asleep due to . obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, rather than tiredness, in the run-up . to the crash. Priyanka's family said after the trial at Warwick Crown Court (pictured) that Booth's sentence is 'nothing compared to the sentence which we will face for the rest of our lives' Following the sentencing, Priyanka’s . relatives released a statement on what they said was 'another milestone . in this dark chapter of our lives'. The statement, released through West . Midlands Police, read: 'We have had to wait and suffer to see justice . done for over a year, on top of coming to terms of the loss of our . daughter Priyanka under such tragic circumstances. 'The sentence Mr Booth has been given . is nothing compared to the sentence which we will face for the rest of . our lives. There will never be a day when we won’t remember the warmth . and love we received from our daughter and the pain we feel from losing . her.' The family added that the aborted . trial had been 'emotionally and physically draining' and had forced them . to relive the horrific and painful events of November 27, 2011. The statement continued: 'We often ask . ourselves how we would act had we killed a four-year-old child as a . result of driving dangerously. 'We can honestly say that we would come forward and take responsibility for our mistake. 'We would want the family to know how . genuinely sorry we were and do everything possible not to cause them any . further pain or suffering. 'It’s very difficult for us to forgive . someone whose actions since that night have demonstrated no genuine . remorse or regret and have been designed only to try and escape . justice.'

Claims: Vicky Pryce (pictured outside court today) was presented with a 'fait accompli' by her husband Chris Huhne who said she must accept his speeding points, her brother told her trial . Vicky Pryce faced a ‘fait accompli’ when her husband Chris Huhne forced her to take his speeding points, her brother said yesterday. George Courmouzis said his sister told him she did ‘something against her will’ shortly after she helped the Lib Dem Cabinet Minister dodge a driving ban. The businessman, who owns a high-profile sports marketing company in Athens, said he knew the speeding incident was a ‘point of contention’ after it took place in 2003. He flew in from Greece to give evidence on Pryce’s behalf in the closing stages of her retrial for perverting the course of justice. Prosecutors asked why he did not give evidence at her first trial but had now appeared ‘like a rabbit out of a hat’. Mr Courmouzis, who owns homes in Notting Hill, Athens and South Carolina, said the matter was mentioned up to five times in 2003. ‘She described it to me as having done something against her will,’ he said. ‘I remember irritation in the spring of 2003 over the fact that Vicky was forced by Chris to take speeding points because he had reached his limit. 'It was mostly irritation about the manner in which she was presented with no option. She had been nominated by him and presented with a fait accompli.’ Mr Courmouzis said his younger sister’s anger grew when Huhne lost his licence anyway over another offence. Under cross-examination by prosecutor Andrew Edis QC, Mr Courmouzis admitted he was called to give evidence only ‘four or five days ago’. And he faced questions about why his comments fitted so neatly into Pryce’s defence of marital coercion – meaning Huhne forced her to commit the crime. Mr Edis added: ‘Have you just come forward out of family loyalty to support her?’ Later, as he summed up the . prosecution case, Mr Edis told the jury to question why the defendant’s . brother ‘appears for the first time like a rabbit out of the hat’. He . said 21st century sexual equality meant Pryce was accountable for what . she did. Allegations: Pryce's brother George Courmouzis (left) claimed she was irritated and upset that Huhne (right) had nominated her as the driver and reacted as someone who had 'done something beyond her will' He said in modern times a ‘true case’ of marital coercion would be ‘very, very rare’. Mr Edis said she exposed her actions out of a thirst for revenge when Huhne left her for bisexual Carina Trimingham. He added: ‘This is a determined, rather dishonest, very sophisticated and manipulative campaign to destroy somebody.’ In Pryce’s defence, Julian Knowles QC . said, despite her success in business she was not ‘superwoman’ and was . vulnerable to marriage pressures. He said the former Government . economics adviser was not proud of her actions when she exposed Huhne’s . wrongdoing in the  bitter aftermath of their collapsed marriage. But he said she was a different woman . eight years earlier who was forced into a ‘second’s lapse’ by her . bullying and ambitious husband. Pryce, 60, of Clapham, South-West . London, denies perverting the course of justice. The jury is expected to . begin considering its verdict today. Disgraced: Huhne (above) resigned as Lib Dem MP for Eastleigh after admitting perverting the course of justice .

The few BBC presenters who did make it to work yesterday found themselves running a vicious Twitter gauntlet. Dozens of militant unionists organised a ‘scabwatch’ to hurl abuse at those who chose not to strike. Lucy Hockings was targeted for doing a live piece to camera, while presenter Jon Sopel and deputy political editor James Landale were slated for reporting live on the Prime Minister’s trip to Mumbai. Even weather presenter Carol Kirkwood fell foul of the tweets. Strike action: BBC staff in Birmingham on the picket line outside BBC Birmingham in The Mailbox . Under fire: Deputy political editor James Landale, left, and even weather presenter Carol Kirkwood, right, fell foul of the tweets . The NUJ action meant viewers expecting to watch Bill Turnbull and Susanna Reid on BBC Breakfast were greeted by Gavin Grey instead. The freelance journalist presented a short news summary between repeats of daytime shows and bulletins on BBC1 at regular intervals throughout the day. A former regional ITV presenter, Mr Grey was used as a back-up newsreader in a 2010 BBC strike. This time he found himself targeted by angry unionists who subjected him to a torrent of online abuse. Peter Middleman, the north-west secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union, wrote: ‘Only a special breed of scab would do it on live TV. Step forward Gavin Grey, grabbing 30 pieces of silver.’ Donnacha DeLong, who describes himself as an ‘anarchist, NUJ activist, freelance journalist, social media journalist and new media consultant’ added: ‘Gavin Grey – scabbing again #bbcstrike #NUJ.’ Later in the day he tweeted a direct message of support to Newsnight economics editor Paul Mason – also on the picket line – saying: ‘Solidarity forever.’ Guy Walters added: ‘Gavin Grey, the newsreader the BBC use when there’s a strike. He’s probably the only Tory in the entire corporation.’ Daniel Giblin – who describes himself online as a ‘part time freedom fighter’ – wrote: ‘Carol Kirkwood breaks the strike again! Live on tv for all to see #turnitoff.’ However, one rarely-seen presenter did surprisingly well out of the strikes. Ghanaian Komla Dumor, 40, usually presents on BBC World Service radio programmes, as well as BBC World News on TV. He received a warm welcome from UK viewers when he was drafted into the BBC News Channel. Andrew Pelling said: ‘Komla Dumor is great.

Actor James Franco has sparked a sexism controversy today after he tweaked the iconic command to signal the start of Daytona 500 in his role as Grand Marshall. Instead of 'Gentlemen, start your engines,' often described as the most famous words in sport, the 34-year-old Hollywood star said 'Drivers...and Danica...start your engines!' Changing his command to accommodate Danica Patrick, the first woman to start from the pole in a Cup race, Franco nevertheless caused Twitter to light up in indignation over his perceived insensitivity. Scroll Down for Video . James Franco used an unfortunate choice of words to signal the start of the Daytona 500 today in Florida in his role as Grand Marshall . As unpredictable as ever, he passed on a chance to copy the instruction that was used when Patrick raced in the Indianapolis 500, 'Lady and gentlemen, start your engines.' His critics pointed out that the published author and poet should have seen the distinction he was creating by making an exception of Danica. His command as Grand Marshall can easily be interpreted as implying that Danica was not a 'driver' like the men who made up the rest of the field. USA Today's motor racing reporter Nate Ryan was especially critical of Franco's perceived mistake, tweeting, 'That command didn't exactly dovetail with Danica Patrick's long-stated worldview of being a driver/racer first and a woman second.' And photographer Zeb Palmer simply stated on the social networking website, 'OK, the grand marshal is dumb. This is first race?' Blogger Chris Credendine remakred that, 'I know James Franco didn't mean it, but he definitely butchered the most famous words in #NASCAR with that Danica Patrick comment.' And viewer Jeanne Rice was the most cutting, tweeting to her followers, 'Wow James. How's that foot taste in your mouth?' The Oscar-nominated actor was in town to promote his new film, 'Oz, the Great and Powerful' and noted in his pre-race press conference that 'Danica had done something special here, so I might have to switch it up.' Prompting unfortunate memories of his awkward co-hosting of the 2011 Oscars alongside Anne Hathaway, Franco's gaffe at the race start indicated that perhaps the actor needed a few more rehearsals.

This time crew chief Chad Knaus can enjoy it – he was suspended by NASCAR for the first victory. Dale Earnhardt Jr. made a late move to finish second, but didn't challenge his Hendrick Motorsports teammate for the victory. Mark Martin was third. Patrick was third on the final lap, but faded in the flurry of late action. She became the first woman in history to lead laps in the Daytona 500, though, with her three laps out front. Before the race all eyes were on Patrick - only the third woman to compete in what is known as 'The Great American Race. Patrick started the Daytona 500 from pole position and no one doubts she deserves all the attention she is receiving or her credentials to compete with the very best. Patrick, who ran a partial Sprint Cup program last year, showed she was ready to race full-time in American stock car racing by qualifying with a top speed of 196.434 mph around Daytona International Speedway last Sunday.

She added: 'We've both recently been baptized and we live together. We don't want to live in sin anymore.' Ms Johnson was frying cheese sticks in her Ohio home five days before her intended wedding day when the grease caught fire.

In the brief ceremony, Ms Johnson walked down the hospital aisle carrying white and red . carnations while the couple's friends and family members hummed the tune to Here Comes the Bride. Wedding attire: The bride wore a red sleeveless dress since a bulky bridal gown would have interfered with her intravenous tubes and monitoring wires .

Guilty: Lisa Foster, 31, was handed a two-year suspended sentence after pleading guilty to stealing almost £8,000 from 81-year-old Frank Kilfoyle who she cared for . A blind pensioner was left starving when a 'family friend' stole money from his bank account to purchase hundreds of DVDs and downloads from iTunes. Frank Kilfoyle, 81, had entrusted Lisa Foster, 31, with his bank details so that she could buy food for him and retrieve cash. But the pensioner was forced to appeal to social workers when his unofficial carer failed to buy him any groceries, keeping most of the money for herself. Bolton Crown Court heard that Foster stole almost £8,000 from Mr Kilfoyle, who had known her since she was a child . Handed a two-year suspended sentence, Foster was told that she escaped jail by the 'skin of her teeth'. Mr Kilfoyle, whose eyes were damaged at birth, suffered from mobility problems and died in January last year, two months after Foster was arrested. His sister Mary Mariner said that the pensioner weighed less than seven stone when he died. Speaking after the hearing, she said: 'God love him, he never got out of bed again. He was skin and bone. He couldn't keep his false teeth in because he had lost so much weight.' After initially visiting his home to carry out repair work as a child, Mr Kilfoyle eventually gave Foster his bank card and pin number and . asked her to withdraw £100 a month for him and to do food shopping. But between January 2010 and November 2011, Foster kept approximately two thirds of what . was withdrawn for herself, shoving only small amounts of cash through his . letter box. It is estimated she took . £7,984.73. In the weeks before she was caught, she . kept all the money for herself, leaving Mr Kilfoyle with no food at his home in Bolton, Greater Manchester. In desperation, he asked for help from the authorities. Prosecutor Neil Fryman told the court that Mr Kilfoyle was in a 'rather sorry state' and was in arrears with electricity, water and other bill. When police were called and visited . Foster they found she had amassed a collection of 700 DVDs and CDs and discovered receipts for a television and jewellery.

Convicted fraudster and Astor heir Anthony Marshall stunned distinguished guests at a lavish party for proposed cruise ship Titanic II on Tuesday after he turned up wearing an heirloom recovered from a relative's body on the doomed voyage and bragged about selling it for $1million. Marshall, 88, has been outcast by New York society since he was convicted of conning his philanthropist mother Brooke Astor out of $60 million in 2009. He and wife Charlene have kept to a frugal life of solitude ever since and are rarely seen in public. However the couple ventured out for the event this week at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in Manhattan, thrown by Australian millionaire Clive Palmer who is behind the ambitious plans to build Titanic II. Scroll down for video . Party guests: Philanthropist Brooke Astor's son Anthony Marshall, 88, (pictured) and wife Charlene attended an event for Titanic II on Tuesday in New York. Marshall wore a pocket watch recovered from the ship and bragged about flogging it for $1million . Values: The watch which Anthony Marshall is planning to sell to the highest bidder belonged to ancestor John Jacob Astor IV, a millionaire and decorated Spanish-American war hero who died in the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 . Sad news: The telegram which was sent to bear the news that JJ Astor's body had been recovered on April 22, 1912 and was identified by his personal effects including a gold watch . Marshall wore the watch which he said had been give to him by his father Vincent Astor. The gold piece had been found on the body of John Jacob Astor IV who was wearing it when he died on the Titanic after it sank on April 15, 1912. The tycoon was the wealthiest person on board the luxury liner when it went down and the timepiece along with his gold watch, cuff links and a ring were later recovered with his body. A source told the New York Post: 'He [Marshall] said the watch had belonged to his . stepfather. And that it had John Jacob’s . initials on the back, which had been used to identify the body.' Marshall was also overheard telling guests that he planned to sell the family heirloom and hoped to fetch $1million.

He passed it to his son Anthony Marshall who is now believed to want to sell it . Sequel: An artist's rendering of the proposed cruise ship Titanic II, provided by the Blue Star Line as Australian tycoon Clive Palmer unveiled plans for his dream ship in New York on Tuesday . Setting sail: The Titanic leaving Southampton on her ill-fated maiden voyage on April 10, 1912 . The Marshalls were among 600 guests at the event to announce the ambitious project due for completion in 2016. John Jacob Astor has become one of the most fabled characters to emerge from the 1,517 passengers who died when the Titanic sank on April 15, 1912. The 47-year-old American tycoon, who built the Astoria Hotel in New York, was returning from his honeymoon on the doomed vessel with his 19-year-old pregnant wife Madeleine. When the Titanic struck the iceberg, Astor helped his wife into a lifeboat but remained onboard. He was last seen smoking a cigarette on the top deck. Half an hour later, the ship slipped beneath the ocean waves. His wife survived. Astor's was one of the 333 bodies recovered on April 22 by a cable ship. He was identified by the initials sewn into his jacket along with his engraved gold watch. Astor's son Vincent inherited the piece and wore it for the rest of his life before passing it on to his son, Anthony. J.J Astor is buried in Trinity Church Cemetery in New York City. Madeleine gave birth to a son on August 14, 1912 who was named after his father. They enjoyed  a dinner based on the final 11-course meal with wine pairings served aboard the Titanic. The great-granddaughter of Titanic survivor and heiress Molly Brown Helen Benziger also attended the Manhattan party, saying that she was 'thrilled' at the new Titanic design. Anthony Marshall and his wife Charlene had lived below the radar following his criminal conviction in 2009. They swapped a charmed existence of dinners, chauffeur-driven cars and charity balls for hospital appointments, meetings with lawyers and court dates. The 88-year-old, who is in poor health following open heart surgery, is estranged from his twin sons. They testified that their father and stepmother were abusing Astor, withholding medical treatment and leaving her to lie drenched in her own urine. Marshall was found guilty of defrauding his mother out of millions, money she had inherited from her third husband, hotelier and realtor Vincent Astor.

"By . Gerri Peev and Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 07:56 EST, 4 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:58 EST, 4 March 2013 . Nick Clegg is sending his eldest son to one of the most over-subscribed state Catholic schools in Britain – the same choice made by Tony Blair for his children. The Deputy Prime Minister’s son, Antonio, will attend the London Oratory School from this autumn. Mr Clegg, who is an atheist, and his wife Miriam chose the elite institution, which is just over two miles from their £1.6million Putney home, ahead of closer state schools – including two ranked as ‘outstanding’ by schools watchdog Ofsted. Nick Clegg and wife Miriam have chosen the London Oratory for their eldest son Antonio to attend form September . They had also considered the Lib Dem leader’s alma mater, the £23,000-a-year Westminster School, but plumped for the state-funded school instead. Miriam Clegg is Spanish and Catholic and the couple’s three children are being raised in the faith. A spokesman for Mr Clegg said he and his wife were ‘delighted’ to get their son into the school. His decision to send his son to a state school comes after he was criticised for even considering educating his eldest child privately. And he will open himself up to accusations of hypocrisy after the Lib Dems, in their 2010 general election manifesto, pledged to stamp out ‘discrimination’ in faith schools on grounds of belief. Mr Clegg’s aides said the family felt ‘lucky’ to get in. When he first became party leader, Mr Clegg was asked if he believed in God. He replied simply: ‘No.’ Later he said he had ‘enormous respect’ for people with faith and added: ‘I’m married to a Catholic and am committed to bringing my children up as Catholics.’ Eleven-year-old Antonio Clegg will attend the London Oratory school from September . Miriam Gonzalez Durantez is a Catholic, and the couple's three sons have been brought up as Catholics. Mr Clegg is an atheist . Under the school’s strict criteria, at least one parent has to be a practising Catholic before a child can be admitted and the pupil is expected to show involvement in the church. Mr Clegg’s spokesman said: ‘Nick married in a Catholic church, his children are Catholics but he has never pretended he is anything other than an atheist.’ According to the London Oratory’s website, there were more than 800 applications for the 2013 intake, and only 160 places allocated. Siblings of existing pupils have a higher chance of getting in to the Oratory, which is good news for the Cleggs as they have two younger sons, Alberto, seven, and four-year-old Miguel. The Blairs sent their sons, Euan and Nicky, to the school. Their daughter Kathryn is believed to have joined in the sixth form. Last year, 97 per cent of sixth-formers gained three or more A-levels at grades A -E. In its last Ofsted report, in 2009, the school was judged to be outstanding. The Clegg family's choice of education will make fewer headlines than if they had opted for a private school, but is not without controversy. Former prime minister Tony Blair attracted some criticism when he sent his two eldest sons, Nicky and Euan, to the top-rated state school, while daughter Kathryn is believed to have joined in the sixth form. The school, which caters only for boys only up to age 16, is extremely popular, and achieves good exam results. Last year, 92 per cent of pupils scored at least five GCSEs at grade C or above, including English and maths, while 97 per cent of sixth-formers gained three or more A-levels at grades A*-E. In its last Ofsted report, in 2009, the school, which became an academy in 2011, was judged to be outstanding overall. London Oratory is part of the Catholic Church, and has strict criteria for pupils to meet when the school is over-subscribed. Priority admission to youngsters who practise the faith, with the school looking firstly at how often the child and his parents attend mass, followed by whether the child fulfils the Church's requirements on baptism, whether they have received their first Holy Communion, and whether the child or a Catholic parent has served in any Catholic Parish or the wider Church. A spokesman for Mr Clegg said: 'In response to media inquiries, Nick and Miriam can confirm that they have decided to send their oldest son, Antonio, from September onwards to the London Oratory School, a state Catholic secondary school. 'He is currently a pupil at a state Catholic primary school, Our Lady of the Victories in Putney, where he has been going for the last six years. 'Now that their decision has been made public, they hope that the privacy of their son will be respected.' However, it could prove controversial that the couple have secured a place at one of the most exclusive schools in the capital. Mr Clegg had previously hinted that the couple would choose a private school for their son. ‘If it works out to send them to a good state (school) we will do so but, like all parents sending their children to secondary school in London, as you know there is huge competition for places,' he said last month. The Deputy Prime Minister said he would put his children’s education first and would not overrule the wishes of his wife or son for ‘political reasons’. It is thought the couple looked around several schools, including The London Oratory and a £30,000-a-year independent school. Education Secretary Michael Gove defended Mr Clegg, and insisted politicians had to do the right thing for their children. He said: ‘Nick Clegg should send his son to the right school for his son. I would absolutely defend him whatever he chose to do. A parent's first responsibility is to their child. David Cameron has insisted he is ‘committed’ to sending his eldest daughter Nancy to a state school, as in London ‘there’s a real improvement taking place’. When it emerged in 2010 that the couple were interested in The London Oratory, the headmaster McFadden, said his school would be a 'natural choice' for the couple, who were 'happy with what they saw'. The Liberal Democrat leader previously insisted it was not 'entirely surprising' that the family was looking at good state Catholic schools. Critics have suggested that other suitable schools are closer. The spokesman said Mr and Mrs Clegg had looked at options but it was a 'very common' choice to attend the Oratory from Antonio's current primary school. 'The reason why they are sending him to the Oratory is quite simple - they think it is the best school for him,' he added..","Lib Dem leader is an atheist but wife Miriam is a practising Catholic .

Shoppers are unwittingly buying own brand supermarket foods high in salt, sugar and fat, an expert has warned . A leading consumer activist has named and shamed the supermarkets guilty of confusing shoppers with unclear labelling. Martin Isark says shoppers are unwittingly buying own brand supermarket foods high in salt, sugar and fat because the information is being hidden from them. As a result, they may be compromising their health without even realising. He told MailOnline: 'It's easier said than done when it comes . to making an informed choice on the content of salt, saturated fat and sugar in pre-packed food on our supermarket shelves. At worst, . nutritional values are not there at all! 'Others appear not to be there, . but they're hiding under the outer label that you have to peel off to . find them, or you require a magnifying glass to read them.' A common trick is displaying salt as . sodium, which is a lower figure and therefore appears to be healthier. Mr Isark, who runs the website and consumer barcode scanning app CanIEatIt (www.canieatit.co.uk), added: 'Just . remember that 1g of Sodium is equal to 2.5g of salt, that sugar can be . labelled as 'carbohydrate' and saturated fat just as fat. 'Obesity, heart disease and type 2 . diabetes are all on the increase – supermarkets should . remember that when they are leaving off the sugar, saturated fat and . salt values. 'At Can I Eat . It we help the shoppers by adding nutritional values of a similar . product to our App when the product’s packet or the website or does not.' Here, from worst to best, he names and shames the worst offenders when it comes to food labelling and then praises those that are the clearest... WAITROSE . Waitrose is the worst when it comes to clear nutrition labelling. The labels are easy to read, but they insist on ‘sodium,’ so you have to multiply it by 2.5 to get the salt level. Why? Are they frightened that shoppers and surfers won’t buy their products if they know the salt level? I have not found a shopper yet who knows that you have multiply the sodium level by 2.5 to get the salt value. Not helpful if you are watching your salt intake. Waitrose does not have any excuses for being bottom of the pile – they control their website and their labelling. A spokesperson for Waitrose said: 'We are committed to clear and open nutritional labelling. We are legally obliged to give a measure for sodium - but we also give a salt value on the vast majority of products.' LIDL . Lidl’s pre-packed products that have been packaged in the UK, are as good as any on the shelves. These labels display easy to read nutritional values per 100g or 100ml. But the products that are produced in Europe have impossible-to-read multi-language labels and some have no nutritional values at all, such as the Ocean Sea, Norwegian Smoked Salmon, which has a very high salt content. Yes, Lidl has 5,000 plus stores throughout Europe, but so do Aldi – and they manage to produce clear, easy to read nutritional labels on their products sold in their UK stores. Lidl was criticised for a lack of labelling on high-salt products such as smoked salmon, while M&S lists the salt in butter as a percentage, which can be misleading . OCADO . Most products have nutritional information on their website, but like Waitrose they choose not to display the salt - does profit come before their shopper’s health? However, www.ocado.com has more and better nutritional information than www.waitrose.com . TESCO . Most items are well-labelled but occasionally, nutritional values are given per slice, per biscuit or per portion - when the norm is to provide nutritional information per 100g or 100ml as well. Adding nutritional information per 100g to all their products would help. MARKS AND SPENCER . I'd say 99 per cent of Marks & Spencer’s nutritional labelling is excellent. However, when space is limited they do use double labelling - where one label is under the other. This is a growing habit by producers to use double or piled up labels on their products to cut down the space needed for all the information required these days. Marmite is a high profile example, where you need peel back one label to reveal the nutritional values underneath. This is rather time-consuming when you're browsing in a shop. SAINSBURY'S . Again, 99 per cent of the nutritional labelling is excellent, but occasionally, we have found that some products have the nutritional values listed by their percentage. For example, a pack of Sainsbury's Farmhouse butter is labelled as having 2 per cent salt. It may seem just a pinch, but that 2 per cent translates into two grams per 100g, which shoots it straight into the high 'red' traffic light zone. However Sainsbury’s are on the right track, and their website has more products displaying nutritional values per 100g or 100ml than Tesco. Mr Isark praised The Co-operative for listing the ingredients even in their alcoholic drinks . MORRISONS . All Morrisons own-branded products we checked had easy-to-read labels and displayed salt, sugar and saturated fat. Adding the ingredients and nutritional values for their alcoholic drinks would be a real plus! ALDI . Aldi has clean and easy-to-read nutritional labelling that leaves you in no doubt how much salt, saturated fat or sugar is in the product. The store has shown that you can be no-frills supermarket and package products with easy to digest nutritional values that enable their shoppers to make a more informed choice so that they and their family can eat more healthily. ASDA . Asda’s nutritional labelling is excellent on their products and their website. Only the occasional baking or cake decoration product lacks nutritional values, but this is the norm for these products. If Asda could extend their nutritional and ingredient information to cover their alcoholic drinks – they would be challenging for the top spot. THE WINNER: . THE CO-OPERATIVE . This store has clean and easy-to-read nutritional labelling that leaves you in no doubt how much salt, saturated fat or sugar that’s in the product. Supermarkets and big brand producers should not wait for health ministers and institutes to wave the big-stick for them to change. The Co-operative has even started listing the ingredients in their alcoholic drinks, even though it's not a requirement at the moment. All supermarkets should follow their lead.","Martin Isark says shoppers are buying own brand supermarket foods high in salt, sugar and .

Vegetarians have reacted with horror to plans by Britain’s biggest crisp maker to start selling smoky bacon and roast chicken crisps that will contain meat for the first time. In what may be a surprise to many, neither of the varieties of crisps made by Walkers contain real bacon or real chicken - but instead rely on artificial flavours. The move to real ingredients is thought to be an attempt to shake off the ‘junk food’ label - but has been greeted with horror by vegetarians who have been tucking into the snacks for years. Change: Walkers plans to start selling smoky bacon (left) and roast chicken (right) crisps that will contain meat . Earlier this month Walkers - part of international food giant Pepsico - tipped off the Vegetarian Society that within weeks their previously meat-free flavours ‘will now contain extracts of meat.’ The news has sparked controversy among vegetarians who can no longer enjoy their favourite flavour crisps and are urging the company to reconsider. In an online forum one wrote: ‘Whether this is simply a publicity stunt planned by the marketing department to cause public outcry, or whether Walkers think this change in ingredients will increase their profits, I will certainly be contacting them to let them know how I feel, and urge you to do the same.’ Another also encouraged fellow veggie consumers to revolt, they wrote: ‘The more people that e-mail them, the more likely they will be to reconsider the new ingredients.’ Flavouring: The change will now be promoted by former England footballer and presenter Gary Lineker next month. He is pictured here in 1998 with model Kelly Brook . The row has caused Walkers customer . services to wade in to try re-assure vegetarians that their products . will continue to be ethical. In . a letter to one complainant they said: ‘I am really sorry that you will . no longer be able to enjoy Walkers roast chicken and smokey bacon . flavoured crisps. ‘I can . understand your concerns over this matter however; we are using only . free-range chicken and freedom food pork to ensure the highest standard . of animal welfare.’ Unmistakably Cheese & Onion including cheese from Somerset .

The change will now be promoted by former England footballer and presenter Gary Lineker next month. In other changes, the firm is to use cheese from Somerset and the salt and vinegar flavour will have real British vinegar. Packets of sour cream and chive crisps with sour cream from Dorset have already been slipped onto shelves as part of a trial by the Leicester-based firm. In 2007, U.S. snack food company Mars was . forced to abandon a move to use animal rennet in its Mars bars bars . after it was bombarded with complaints from vegetarians. Walkers could . not be contacted for comment last night. Last year Walkers was slammed by customers who counted as few as five whole crisps in a packet of their newest brand, Walkers Deep Ridged. Things got so bad that the BBC’s Watchdog programme launched an investigation after receiving a number of complaints about the pitiful amount of crisps in the multipack bags. Their investigation found a maximum of 13 crisps in bag and a minimum of 11. But other consumers also contacted the show to report that they had seen as few as five crisps in their multipack bags. Walkers were quick to hit back at the criticism claiming that their deep ridged crisps were more prone to breakage and were protected by being sold in slightly bigger packets – giving the false impression that there were less crisps in them. But that didn’t stop angry customers taking to twitter to voice their frustration. Nicole Bourcine wrote said: ‘#crispgate I just opened a bag had 6 whole crisps and some bits.

Yellow-legged Asian hornets that prey on bees are among the latest non-native species threatening UK wildlife, and even people’s health. A growing number of alien species, from killer shrimps to Spanish slugs, are set to soon reach our shores, a Europe-wide study warns. The Asian hornet, which grows to between 2.5cm and 3cm (1-1.2 inches), preys on native honeybees, wasps and other pollinators, potentially devastating hives and threatening honey and crop production. Killer: The Asian hornet can measure up to 1.2inches long and preys on honey bees. wasps and other polinators . The hornets could devastate bee hives, threatening the production of honey and crops . The report from the European Environment Agency (EEA) also warned of the spread of the Asia tiger mosquito, which is linked to more than 20 diseases including yellow fever and the dengue-like chikungunya fever. The species is prevalent in several southern European countries, such as Italy, and is likely to expand its range north as the climate changes. A number of alien species already in the UK are causing problems. Common ragweed, which came in to Europe from North America in bird feed is a potent trigger for hayfever and other allergies. The Spanish slug, which reaches up to 15cm (6 inches) in length can hit garden planting and horticulture, as they eat plants as well as carrion and even each other. Well-established invaders from across the Atlantic include the American mink which has destroyed water vole populations and the grey squirrel, from North America, which has driven its native red cousin from most of England. More recent arrivals include killer shrimps, which feed on other aquatic wildlife and can cause local extinctions of naturally-found species and zebra mussels, thought to have arrived in ship ballasts, which can damage infrastructure such as water plants and locks. The new list of invaders join established non-native species which have set up home in Britain such as the grey squirrel . Ring-necked, or rose-ringed, parakeets are now found across much of Britain, and there are concerns that they damage fruit crops by targeting buds and blossoms of various trees and shrubs. They may also carry diseases which can affect humans and are often seen as a noise nuisance in urban areas because of their loud screeching calls. Other species posing problems to the UK include brook trout, American bullfrogs, rhododendrons, Japanese knotweed, harlequin ladybirds and the horse chestnut leaf-miner moth. Across Europe, invasive alien species cost around £10 billion a year, the EEA report said. Species are most commonly brought in for horticulture, while other reasons they are brought in include farming, hunting and fishing or as pets. Some stow away, such as the zebra mussel and are introduced unintentionally, the study said. Increasing tourism and trade in recent decades may have led to increasing numbers of alien invaders, while climate change may also be playing a role in the spread of species, by making areas increasingly suitable for new plants and animals. Invading plants and animals are a major threat to already-struggling wildlife, with 110 out of the 395 European species designated as critically endangered at risk of dying out because of non-native species. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA executive director, said: ‘In many areas, ecosystems are weakened by pollution, climate change and fragmentation. ‘Alien species invasions are a growing pressure on the natural world, which are extremely difficult to reverse.’","Predators, which can grow up to 1.2inches long, could threaten hives .

Zimbabwean despot Robert Mugabe says he is 'very lonely' since his political contemporaries died and complained that his Cabinet is full of 'children'. In an interview with the state-controlled Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation to mark his 89th birthday, Mugabe said he had nobody left to share memories of the 1930s and Fifties or of years spent chasing girls. He said that his colleagues were much more likely to listen to him than share ideas because they were too young to match his knowledge. Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe has complained of being lonely now that his contemporaries are dead . The president, who is Africa's oldest leader, said that 78-year-old Didymus Mutasa, the minister for state for presidential affairs and the Zanu PF secretary for administration, was the only minister who could come close to sharing his experiences. Politicians who were involved with the fight for independence alongside Mugabe, such as three consecutive vice-presidents Joshua Nkomo, Joseph Msika and John Nkomo, have since died in office. Joshua Nkomo died in 1999, his successor Msika in 2009, while John Nkomo died of cancer in January this year. Mugabe, who has ruled Zimbabwe since gaining independence from Britain in 1980, told ZBC that he looked down on his fellow politicians because of their relatively tender age. He said: 'They have not had the same experience, the same length of life and, therefore, the same advantage of gathering as much knowledge and experience as yourself. 'And so you can't discuss with them things that happened in the 1930s or even 1950s. 'You take my Cabinet as it is: there is no one I can talk to about how we used to approach girls or we would go to this and that place, riding bicycles. 'There are others like Mutasa. He comes close, but others are just children. 'You feel that loneliness. You have lost others and sometimes you think of it and it makes you very lonely.' Mugabe, who is married to his 47-year-old former secretary Grace, told the broadcaster: 'The consoling part of it is that, well fine, there are young ones and young minds you can talk to. 'You can also try to educate, you can also try to relate a bit of history to and so on and so forth. But they remain young ones who listen much more than they share ideas with you.' Mugabe's complaints may not be taken too seriously by some, reminded of the 2004 film Team America, where a puppet of the late North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il sings about his loneliness.

House prices in Britain’s most exclusive neighbourhood have soared by a record-breaking £120,000 in the past year – while values have stalled or fallen in most of the country. It means homeowners in Kensington and Chelsea, West London, saw the worth of their properties rise by enough to pay for an entire house in many UK regions. And some experts say one of the main factors fuelling the ever-growing north-south property divide is the huge bonuses paid to bankers and other City workers. Homeowners in Kensington and Chelsea saw the worth of their properties rise by enough to pay for a house in Huddersfield . Figures released by the Land Registry yesterday revealed that the price of the average home in Kensington and Chelsea rose by nearly 12.5 per cent – £118,754 – over the past year, more than a full-time worker on the national average of £26,462 earns in four and a half years. As a result, the average home in Kensington and Chelsea costs £1.08million, the only part of Britain where the average price is over £1million. By comparison, the average home in the North East – the cheapest area of the country – is £99,294, and in the North West it is £106,527. The yearly rise in values in the upmarket London borough, a favourite location for foreign billionaires, could also buy a home in Wales, where the average price is £116,545, or Yorkshire and the Humber, where it is £114,669. The figures highlight the extraordinary gulf between the cost of buying in London and property values in the rest of the country. Prices in the capital went up by 7.1 per cent over the year and by 2.5 per cent in January alone, taking the average to £373,207. In the month of November last year, more than 430 homes in London were bought for over £1million. Prices in the North West showed the biggest decline, falling 4.2 per cent over the year and 1.9 per cent in January. North south divide: The figures highlight the gulf between the cost of buying in London and property values in the rest of the country . Overall, house prices rose by one per cent in January to an average of £162,441 in England and Wales. Peter Rollings, chief executive of estate agency Marsh & Parsons, said: ‘These figures confirm what we have been saying for some time. London is a unique market within the UK.’ Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said: ‘There is an extraordinary difference between the housing market in London and the rest of the country. While areas such as Kensington and Chelsea storm ahead, house prices in the North of England are in reverse as the gap between north and south grows ever wider.’ Estate agency Savills said yesterday that the soaring cost of London properties has been fuelled by bonuses paid to City workers over the past decade. Since 2003, it said, around £23billion in bonus money from finance and insurance workers has been ploughed into prime homes in the capital. A further £14billion has been used to buy homes in commuter areas such as Elmbridge, Reigate, St Albans and Sevenoaks. The Savills report said more than 50 per cent of buyers in prime areas of central London work in the financial and business sector. Despite the economic downturn, bonuses continue to be paid, causing prices to rise to levels other workers cannot afford. Lucian Cook, director of residential research at Savills, said: ‘We estimate that some £3billion of bonus money was injected into prime London and South East markets in 2012.’ Over the past decade, just in Kensington and Chelsea £4billion of bonus windfalls has been used to buy a home, a second home or a buy-to-let property, he estimates.","Experts say huge bonuses paid to bankers are contributing to growing north-south divide .

Paula Broadwell, the one-time mistress of CIA Director David Petraeus, has had her scheduled promotion revoked by the Army according to a Defense Department official. Broadwell, a major in the Army reserves, had been approved for promotion to lieutenant colonel, but that was prior to last November's revelations that she and Petraeus had been conducting an illicit affair. In the wake of the scandal, Broadwell is under investigation by the Army for having classified information in her home without permission. Sex scandal: Paula Broadwell has had her promotion revoked by the Army following her affair with ex-CIA director General David Petraeus . A major in the Army reserves, Broadwell had been due to be promoted to lieutenant colonel . Her promotion was initially approved in August, but under Army regulations ‘if new information comes to light’ within six months of a promotion date it can make the person ineligible. Broadwell has been deemed ineligible because she remains under investigation for a matter that could result in her being punished by the Army, an unnamed Defense Department official told CNN. Her promotion is revoked until the matter is resolved, but she would become eligible again should she be cleared of any wrong doing, the official said. Broadwell’s security clearance, which was suspended last year, has not yet been reinstated. Petraeus had an affair with Broadwell, principal author of his biography 'All In: The Education of General David Petraeus' from late 2011 until the Summer of 2012 when he apparently ended the relationship.

This photograph from June 2011 shows Broadwell watching as Petraeus and his wife Holly arrive for a Senate Select Intelligence Committee hearing on Petraeus' nomination to be director of the CIA . The messages, which have been described as 'kind of cat-fight stuff', had been sent anonymously to an account shared by Mrs Kelley and her husband, but FBI investigators traced them to Broadwell. In one of the emails from Broadwell to Kelley, she accused the Florida housewife of touching 'him' underneath a table and another email asked if Kelley's husband was aware of her actions. In another, the biographer was apparently aggressive towards Kelley, saying: 'Who do you think you are?' She also accused the socialite, a Petraeus family friend, of 'parad[ing] around the base', adding: 'You need to take it down a notch.' Although the sending of the emails was deemed to be insufficient grounds for a criminal charge, the FBI called Broadwell in for questioning, at which time she admitted to the affair with Petraeus. After Broadwell turned over her computer, classified documents were found, which led to further FBI scrutiny of her relationship with Petraeus.

It has always been said a few stiff drinks make the plainest face more inviting - but ‘beer goggles’ do not make us think people are more attractive than they are, experts have claimed. It is rather a fluke of nature that alcohol closes down the section of the mind that stops us acting on impulse long before it deadens the ‘reptilian’ part responsible for our sexual urges, says Dr Amanda Ellison. The area of the brain that makes us want to mate is the oldest part - and sited so far down it keeps functioning however much we drink - until we are ready to pass out. 'Beer goggles' do not make us think people are more attractive than they are, brain expert Dr Amanda Ellison claims . Dr Ellison says it is a myth that beer goggles fool us into thinking someone is more attractive than they really are. But even relatively small amounts of alcohol will stop the various parts of the brain working properly together. Dr Ellison, senior lecturer in the Department of Psychology at Durham University, has been pulling together a range of research into how alcohol affects the brain, as the nation’s drink problem increases. She says that while evolution had made women more choosy about who they go to bed with, both sexes are looking for a soul mate - and personality is just as important as looks in selecting a partner. However, all this goes out of the window when we drink because of the sequence in which alcohol acts on areas of the brain. She said: ‘Alcohol switches off the rational and decision making areas of the brain while leaving the areas to do with sexual desire relatively intact, and so this explains beer goggles. ‘We still see others basically as they are. There is no imagined physical transformation - just more desire.’ However, a number of previous studies have suggested we start seeing things when the opposite sex and alcohol are involved. Alcohol affects the part of the mind responsible for impulse before the part responsible for sexual urges, claims scientist . A Bristol University experiment claimed people do appear more attractive to both sexes after they have had a drink. American research maintained that men rated pictures of women more highly after looking at alcohol-linked words and London’s Roehampton University claimed men and women had problems rating faces for attractiveness after drinking. However, Dr Ellison’s book, Getting Your Head Around the Brain, argues men and women do not see each other any differently no matter how much they drink. But after as little as half a pint of beer alcohol starts bonding with the receptors of the upper lobes which control decision-making. The more primitive section of the brain in the cortex below which governs our sex drive is carrying on unaffected. Normally, this part of the brain is kept in check by the upper lobes. So, while sober we are constantly weighing up questions of looks versus personality in our search for the right soul mate. When sober you would look at a member of the opposite sex and decide you were not attracted to them. But that decision making process was impaired by alcohol. However, a bag of crisps or peanuts could stop things getting out of hand, Dr Ellison says. ‘You would have some food in your stomach and the salt would aid rehydration by retaining water and stopping you pee-ing it all away,’ she said. The first area of the brain to be affected by alcohol is cerebellum - the motor control area. Next to go is the frontal lobes which control our rational decision-making. Sexual desire is in the reptilian section of the mind under the cortex. Even though women use both sides of the brain to make sexual decisions this was no defence against alcohol. 'Beer goggles' affect both sides of the brain, particularly the frontal lobes which we use to make decisions and recognise the consequences of our actions. The other thing which informs sexual desire is pheromones which we can smell and cause us to be attracted subconsciously to people with different immune systems so off-spring will have elements of both and be stronger. Once the brain started rehydrating and the alcohol loosened its grip on the receptors of the brain it had bound to and rational thinking returned. Dr Ellison said: ‘Memory may not come back but rationality does. As the brain rehydrates and the toxins are flushed away the alcohol ceases to bind to the brain receptors and the frontal lobes kick back in.’ She believes that the booze culture needed more research before a whole new generation was born to couples who could not stand each other. While love-hate relationships have now been largely explained away by pheromones - which trigger the basic instinct to mate - drink-fuelled romance was being driven by social change. Traditionally, it was the man who - having had one too many - made the advances while the more sober woman decided whether to accept or reject. But with more and more men and women being flung together by booze, Dr Ellison argues it is vital to understand how the rules of attraction are bent by over indulgence: ‘We have got to try and work out what the social effect alcohol is having now in an era when contraception is widely available and we have a culture where drinking is the norm,’ she said. ‘New studies are going to be very interesting in how it affects the rules of attraction. ‘Pheromones may be turned off by beer goggles. It’s entirely possible they are - but we don’t know.’","'Beer goggles' do not make us think people are more attractive, says Durham University expert Dr Ellison .

He is currently the chairman of the First Great Western Trains advisory board and of the Plymouth Area Business Council, as well as the president of the charity he founded, The Plymouth Drake Foundation. But he admits that his illness has forced him to slow down. 'I have reduced my work a little,' said the father of three. 'Although I do not think you should just give everything up when you are ill. That's the wrong attitude to take.' The Howeson children have now all flown the nest with the youngest Tavoya, 20, studying in Oxford while Pippa, 30, and Robin, 29, are both making a living in London. 'They are saddened that we're moving but they are realistic and fully understand the reason we're selling,' said Mr Howeson. 'We know that we have been incredibly lucky to live here but now we require a simpler way of life.'","Train firm executive Charles Howeson is selling his 'perfect' family home .

And if Geoffrey Boycott fancies a trip down memory lane, the cramped National Coal Board terraced house where he lived as a young boy is  just a short drive away from his  new home. In every other aspect, however, his magnificent £1.75million Georgian mansion could be in a different world. Back to his roots: Cricket legend Geoff Boycott is moving back to his beloved Yorkshire after buying Boston Hall (above) in Boston Spa for £1.75million . Humble: The former England batsman's new property is a world away from the two up, two down terraced home (above) where he grew up in Fitzwilliam, West Yorkshire . Loyalties: Boycott wants to be nearer Yorkshire County Cricket Club, where he is president and his wife Rachel (pictured) is actively involved in the club's 150th anniversary celebrations . The Grade II listed property was built . in 1807 as a ‘gentleman’s residence’ and judging by the superb rooms, . complete with chandeliers and oil paintings, little has changed over the . centuries. The cricketing legend has been living away from his beloved home county in recent years for health reasons. He and his wife Rachel, who have a . daughter, Emma, have split their time between homes in South Africa and . Jersey to take advantage of the warmer climate as Boycott recovered from . cancer. But a desire to be nearer friends and family and cut down on . travelling has led the 72-year-old to snap up Boston Hall in the . upmarket West Yorkshire town of Boston Spa. The property boasts six bedrooms and . five reception rooms with elegant gardens and the front gates are . adorned with a pair of golden stag heads. The mansion was the head- quarters of . the Ogden Group, an international property developer, but planning . permission was granted to turn it into a private home and the Boycotts . were quick to strike a deal. Grand designs: Boycott and his wife Rachel bought the converted farmhouse to be closer to family and his beloved Yorkshire Cricket Club . Stunning: Boston Hall, which dates back to 1807, is located in the village of Boston Spa, near Wetherby in North Yorkshire . Change of hands: A removals van is pictured outside 19th Century Boston Hall last week . Exquisite: The house boasts six bedrooms, five reception rooms, large sash windows throughout and rolling gardens surrounded by a large terrace . Speaking from New Zealand, where he is . commentating on England’s forthcoming Test series, Boycott said: ‘After . my cancer of the tongue in 2002, once in remission we went to live in . Jersey for my health, not tax reasons. ‘While we love everything about the . island, the scenery, the people and the way of life, the extra flying . back and forth has been tiring and time-consuming. ‘We want to be nearer to our daughter, . Emma, who has just qualified as a lawyer, other family members, our . friends and Yorkshire cricket.’ Boycott was diagnosed with cancer in . September 2002 and forced to take food in liquid form to reduce the pain . in his throat. But he said his spirits were kept up by his wife, whom . he married in February 2003. The couple’s new home is just a short drive . from the Headingley cricket ground where he is the county club’s . president as well as one of its greatest former players. From above: An aerial picture of Boston Hall, which for many years was the head office of the Ogden Group . Grounds: The former England cricketer said, 'We want to be nearer to our daughter, Emma, who has just qualified as a lawyer, other family members, our friends and Yorkshire cricket' And the . Boycotts have wasted no time in putting their plans for the mansion into . action. They have applied for permission for an ‘orangery and garage’ as well as to carry out internal renovations in the listed building. Their home in Jersey, reportedly bought for £1.2million in 2006, is . likely to be sold. Born the son of a coal miner, Geoffrey . Boycott was the eldest of three boys who grew up in  the mining village . of Fitzwilliam, West Yorkshire. The family lived in a two-up, two-down . terraced house and the young Geoffrey went to the local primary school . where he showed early promise in cricket. Settling down: The Boycotts have not had a permanent base in Yorkshire since selling Pear Tree Farm (pictured) in the village of Woolley, near Wakefield, West Yorkshire . His Test career spanned 18 years and . he scored more than 8,000 test runs before moving on to a successful . career as a commentator. Boycott is without question a very wealthy man but his earnings from his media work have not been disclosed. In 2011 he unsuccessfully tried to sue . solicitors over advice he was given about a £2.5million property in . Sandbanks, Dorset, he had bought with former lover Anne Wyatt in 1996. Boycott had expected to inherit her share when she died in 2009 but she left it to a relative. Born in 1940, Geoffrey Boycott (pictured right) is one of England's most well-known and well-respected cricketers after he went on to captain both his country and his beloved Yorkshire. The batsman made his test debut against Australia in June, 1964, at Nottingham, and went on to play a total of 108 tests, scoring 8,114 runs, at an average of 47.72, in the process. He is considered one of the finest defensive batsmen to have played the game and is the fourth-highest accumulator of first-class centuries in history. For eight seasons he was the captain of Yorkshire after taking over the role from Brian Close in 1970. He became the first England cricketer to pass 8,000 Test runs and his Test career included 22 centuries, a record that was recently broken by current England captain Alastair Cook. Boycott was England captain for the 1978 tour of Pakistan and New Zealand. The year before saw him become the first English player to bat on all days of a five day Test, against Australia at Trent Bridge. During his 108 Tests, England were defeated just 20 times.","Ex-England star, 72, wants to be near family and Yorkshire Cricket Club .

It seems barely big enough to swing one cat in, but this run-of-the mill mid-terrace property is home to 20 of them. The cats have had the run of this modest £105,000 property – cared for by a team of visiting volunteers - since owner Shirley Maynard was admitted to hospital in 2011 when her health began to fail. But their future at the property is now under threat after the volunteers discovered the childless pensioner’s will makes no provision for the cats continued care at the address. Animal lovers: Michael and Shirley Maynard set up a charity for cats in their home . Dana Demidoff, one of the 20 volunteers who visit on a rota basis to clean, groom, feed and play with the cats, said: ‘It’s a worrying time for us. We know that Shirley cared very deeply for the cats and that’s why she set up this charity in her own home. But legalities might force us to close. ‘This house is a safe haven for elderly or poorly cats who live their final days in peace and quiet. We come in and look after them.’ No room to swing a cat: Twenty cats have been allowed to take over the three bedroom property . Mrs Maynard, 77, who is now thought to be in care, began taking in elderly and ill cats in the 1980s with husband Michael and officially registered their three-bedroom property as a charitable hospice to care for the animals 16 years ago. Under threat: The cats have been allowed to live at the property since 2011 . At one point the address was home to as many as 90 waifs and strays. But following Mr Maynard’s death in 2008 at the age of 74, his widow’s health began to deteriorate and the volunteers formed a board of trustees to manage the Maynards’ St Francis Hospice for Cats. The trustees have recently discovered that Mrs Maynard’ will does not leave the house to the cats and, although they believe it was her wish for the home in Littleover, Derby, to continue as a cat sanctuary, she is now too ill to make changes to her bequest. Mrs Demidoff, who is also a trustee, from Breadsall, Derby, added: ‘We have decided not to take in any more cats until we know more. ‘We think Shirley would have wanted to leave the hospice to the cats but maybe she didn’t get round to making her wishes known. 'Now she’s not well enough.’ Mrs Maynard grew up in Derbyshire and worked as a laboratory assistant. She married her husband, who had been posted in the area during his RAF service, in 1955. The pensioner was inspired to start taking in cats after working as a volunteer with the Cats Protection League and the RSPCA. Together with her husband, she even extended and converted parts of the house to make it more feline-friendly. Many of the cats the Maynards have cared for down the years have suffered from the feline version of HIV – FIV. No place like home: Gill Andrews feeding Francis the cat who lives in the property . Guest: This black feline enjoys living at the hospice for felines but now its future is threatened . Sanctuary: The house has been filled with pet toys and scratching posts and at one point was home to 64 cats . Since Mrs Maynard moved out of the house, valuable furniture and electronic equipment such as the television have been removed, leaving more space for pet toys and scratching posts. Cat beds are scattered throughout the property, with the kitchen used as a wash room to clean bedding and blankets. Upstairs, the Maynards’ furniture has been taken away with the space now used as a store area for cat food and medication. The floor is tiled to help keep the place clean and there are cat beds and toys around the house. The charity costs around £30,000 to run annually – with much of the cost going on vets’ bills and medication - surviving on donations from cat lovers around the world who have read about its good work through the hospice’s webpage. Caring: Volunteer Gill Andrews (pictured) visits four times a week to keep the house tidy . Volunteer Gill Andrews visits four times a week to keep the house tidy. After checking all the cats are OK, she reads the note left by the last volunteer, feeds all the cats, empties their litter trays and then does some cleaning before grooming and playing with the cats.

Positioned on the clifftops of Hawaii with stunning views and the calming sounds of the crashing waves, Kalaupapa would be the perfect location for any spa retreat. But for the last 146 years, the small village has been used as a colony for leprosy patients, many of whom were torn from their families and banished to the idyllic peninsula for quarantine. Kalaupapa, the world's first leper colony, had a population of 1,200 patients at its height and has treated more than 8,000 sufferers since it opened in 1866. Scroll down for video . Banished: Children and adults stand outside Father Damien's church in the late 19th century when around 600 sufferers were shipped to the island . Much-admired: Father Damien, known as the leper priest of Molokai, was named a saint by the Roman Catholic Church in 2009 . Now it caters for just 17 and the future of the place they fondly call home is uncertain. They have chosen to speak out to coincide with the impending canonization later this month of Mother Marianne Cope, one of the many Catholic nuns who have ministered the settlement. They told of burying spouses, having babies taken away and being treated like they were a 'monkey show'. But despite the painful memories, most are still desperate to preserve their way of life. 'I've heard people say it would be a nice resort,' 81-year-old Barbara Marks told www.syracuse.com. 'I don't want them to do that to Kalaupapa. I don't want it to change. It's our home.' Doing God's work: This is St Philomena Church, where Father Damien ministered for his 16 years on Kalaupapa before his death in 1889 from leprosy . Trouble in paradise: A view through the back of St Francis Church on the leper colony of Kalaupapa, Hawaii, where more than 8,000 sufferers were banished since it opened in 1866 . Visiting room: Named the Long House because of its shape, it was built in 1933 as a place for relatives and friends to visit patients, sitting on opposite sides of the table . Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease after physician Gerhard Armauer Hansen, is a chronic disease caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium lepromatosis. Left untreated, the disease can cause permanent damage to the skin, nerves, limbs and eyes. A common myth is that body parts can fall off, but it can cause limbs to become numb or diseased from secondary infections. Although the form of transmission remains uncertain, it is thought to be through respiratory droplets. The World Health Organization estimated that in 1995 between two and three million people were permanently disabled because of leprosy. In the past 20 years, 15 million people have been cured of leprosy worldwide. Elroy Malo, now 77, went to Kalupapa, a peninsula on the island of Molokai, when he was 12. He lost the use of his hands and feet and became blind at 30, but says his time at the colony was 'fabulous'. Mr Malo, who now lives at a state-run . extension of Kalaupapa due to his poor health, said: 'We could go . hiking and hunting in valleys and swim anytime. 'We went spear-fishing. We were just stranded there, and yet I loved it,' he told www.syracuse.com. Some, like Clarence Kahilihwa, however, say they felt 'dirty' and regarded the village like a prison. The . colony opened a year after Hawaii's King Kamehameha V brought in the . Act to Prevent the Spread of Leprosy to enforce the exile of sufferers. By . 1873, when Father Damien, the only other Roman Catholic from the island . to be made a saint, began working on Kalaupapa, about 600 patients had . been shipped there. The population later reached a high of 1,200 in 1890 after Mother Marianne was overseeing her ministry. But . since the introduction of new medication in the 1940s, few patients . were sent there and the quarantine was eventually lifted in 1969. Patients were free to leave, but many didn't want to. 'I had a lot of sadness, but my life was not all bad,' Marks said.","Kalaupapa, Hawaii, has treated 8,000 sufferers since it opened in 1866 .

A student who piled on the pounds after gorging on takeaways at university has lost three stone and become a fitness instructor - after taking up pole dancing. Jenn Brady, 22, tipped the scales at 13 stone and was mortified after doctors told her she was obese when she went for a check-up last January. She ballooned in weight after snacking on a student diet of crisps, chocolate and takeaways while studying computer systems at Nottingham Trent University. Scroll down for video . Jenn Brady, 22, was inspired to slim after her GP told her she was obese during a routine heck-up last year . But after deciding to go on a diet Jenn decided to take up the erotic pastime in a bid to lose weight and soon saw the pounds begin to fall off. Less than 12 months later she has lost three stone and dropped from a frumpy size 16 to a svelte size 10 for the first time in her life. And today Jenn - who is now a fitness instructor - said that shedding the weight was thanks to pole dancing. She said: 'In January last year I went to see the doctor and she weighed me and did the BMI check and said I was obese. Jenn decided to diet after a doctor told her she was obese when she tipped the scales at 13 stone in Janauary last year . 'It was definitely a shock. I wish somebody had said something to me when I was gaining a bit of weight. 'I think I've always been a little bit bigger but when I did go to university it was crisps and chocolate and eating takeaways instead of proper meals. 'I started pole dancing and found I was able to do some of the moves and had a bit of a natural talent for it. 'It never crossed my mind as something I wanted to do but my friend did it for her 21st birthday party and that's when I got into it. 'I had in the back of my mind to get into a size 10 dress for my graduation in November and I was thrilled when I did it. Jenn, who studied Computing Systems at Nottingham Trent University, had ballooned to a bigger frame by snacking on a student diet of crisps, chocolate and takeaways . 'I joined the pole dancing society at university and then when I finished I joined my local pole dancing studio. 'I go once a week on a Friday and do an intermediate class with my friend. 'It is quite a rigorous workout for the whole body. It works almost every single muscle. 'I enjoy it a lot more now. To do the moves you have to show a little skin because it is all about skin to pole contact. 'When I was first starting going upside down and showing a bit of belly I would quickly roll my top up to go on the pole but then quickly roll it down when I finished. 'But now I'm more body confident and happy to wear crop tops and hot pants. 'For me exercise has to be fun.' Jenn, who has been inspired to become a fitness instructor after her weight loss, said that shedding the stones was thanks to regular exercise on the pole . Since losing the weight, Jenn, who lives with her parents in Rugby, Warks., has even won a competition at Bliss Dance Studios where she goes once a week. She has even gained the confidence to make her own pole dancing video to enter into the Midlands Pole Dancing championships in April this year. Jenn has also continued to lose the weight by eating healthily after joining her local Slimming World group - which she now runs. She added: 'I feel a lot more confident since losing the weight. 'I probably wouldn't have entered such a big competition if I was bigger. 'I'm sure I would still be able to do the moves if I was 13 stone but it's got to be easier now and I am definitely a lot fitter than I was.
