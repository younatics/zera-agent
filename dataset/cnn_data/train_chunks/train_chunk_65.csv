"(CNN) -- World Cup stars Bruno Alves and Miguel Veloso are poised to leave Portugal for new clubs in Russia and Italy. Defender Alves, who played in all of Portugal's games in South Africa, will join Zenit St. Petersburg subject to passing a medical after his club Porto agreed a fee of $29 million. The 28-year-old must also negotiate personal terms, Porto said in a website statement on Tuesday. He has been at Porto, who finished third in the Portuguese league last season, since 2001 but has only been a first-team regular for the past five years. Zenit, the 2007 Russian champions and winners of the the UEFA Cup the following year, were also third in their league. Meanwhile, Veloso will leave Sporting Lisbon and join Genoa in a deal worth a reported $12 million, which will rise with various clauses. The 24-year-old played twice at the World Cup, where Portugal lost in the second round to neighbors and eventual champions Spain. He follows fellow midfielder Joao Moutinho in leaving Sporting, following that player's $14 million switch to Porto, with Genoa's Spanish midfielder Alberto Zapater moving to Lisbon. ""Sporting have reached an agreement in principle with Genoa for the transfer of Miguel Veloso and the acquisition of Alberto Zapater, with the consent of both players,"" Sporting said in a statement on Tuesday. Meanwhile, English champions Chelsea will sign Brazil defender Ramires from Portuguese league winners Benfica according to several British media reports. The 23-year-old is due to have a medical before signing a four-year contract by the end of this week, claimed the Daily Mail newspaper.","Portugal defender Bruno Alves to have medical at Russian club Zenit St. Petersburg .

"New York (CNN) -- Tommy Hilfiger began his career selling jeans out of the back seat of his car in upstate New York. On Sunday night, the designer celebrated the 25th anniversary of his fashion label with 25 limited-edition pieces inspired by American legends. ""It's been an amazing journey from where I started,"" Hilfiger told CNN as looks derived from classic style icons hit the runway. ""Grace Kelly--we have a halter dress inspired by her and a sleeveless trench, but with a modern twist,"" Hilfiger said. Next came a Steve McQueen-inspired navy pea coat, a James Dean-inspired leather motorcycle jacket and a Debbie Harry-inspired hooded sweater. Hilfiger said music, film and pop culture have always helped spark his ideas. In the early days, top rap musicians often sported his label. It symbolized cool street-wear in the 1980s and 1990s. Today's collection has evolved into a more preppy, country-club, classic look -- but with a rock 'n' roll vibe. ""It's what I like to call the Tommy Twist,"" Hilfiger said, dressed in one of his own looks for the season: red trousers and a navy blue blazer, the epitome of relaxed preppy. In keeping with his pop-culture-infused style, the fashion show's after-party featured a live performance of critically acclaimed American rock band The Strokes, who made a comeback appearance after years of touring in Europe and Canada. After four years on hiatus while honing their skills on the music festival circuit overseas, the invite-only bash at the Metropolitan Opera House was the perfect opportunity to return home, said Denise Sullivan, a spokeswoman for Hilfiger and the band. ""Tommy has a long history of involvement with rock stars, and The Strokes respect that,"" she said. More than 1,200 guests turned out, and -- in typical ""Tommy"" style -- the turnout was diverse; musicians and Hollywood stars mingled with high school teenagers, bankers and airplane pilots. Music legend Russell Simmons and former wife Kimora Lee attended, along with Jennifer Lopez, Serena Williams and Lenny Kravitz. The Strokes performed on the second-tier balcony -- above the Met's grand, red velvet stairs and beside bold Chagall paintings -- emphasizing again the theme of the evening, the Hilfiger motto of ""classic meets rock.""","The designer's collection includes looks inspired by Grace Kelly and James Dean .

"(CNN) -- Not long before he took office, President Barack Obama said something I am sure he now regrets. ""There are a lot of people who seem to think they know how to run this country. I hope they'll let me hear from them."" At least I think I remember him saying something like that. Anyway, it was a huge mistake, because I have now written 600 letters to the White House. One every day since he was inaugurated. It started as a joke. I thought the idea of sending armchair advice to the Leader of the Free World was funny and my first letter was really little more than congratulations. Read the first letter . But after I posted letters on the ""AC360"" blog for 10 days, a lot of readers liked them, so I extended the string to the first month. Then the first 100 days. Then 200. And now, I have written enough to fill two books. And yes, I am aware that this can look like either dedication or mental illness, depending on your point of view. Most of the letters are funny, or at least they make me laugh. Like the one I wrote about his fancy new presidential limo. Mr. President, How's the 6,000-pound beast? But plenty are serious, too. I've written about swine flu, Haiti, the Middle East, the wars and of course the economy. I've taken the president to task now and then; for example, when he wrote to the big guy in North Korea instead of me, his dedicated pen pal. Wait a minute, Mr. Postman . I've written about my own personal struggles and triumphs, such as being trapped in Indianapolis, Indiana, by a blizzard while my beloved Saints played the Colts in the Super Bowl. Trapped in Indiana . Sometimes I depart from my regular fare to share events in my life that have shaped my views, like a long story about when I first encountered racism as a child. When I discovered racism . Grinding out so many full-length letters has not always been easy, especially in our increasingly shorthand, e-mailing, texting world; OMG LOL. After all, I do have a day job. Many nights, long after the Washington newsmakers are asleep and my family is, too, I sit in the darkness of our living room typing away while the dog snoozes at my feet. Happens on the road in hotels, too. I mean, without the dog, of course. I considered actually mailing the letters at the start, but decided that if I had to keep up with stamps, envelopes and figuring out how to print on the road I'd give up. Plus, he's a very hi-tech president, so online posting seems adequate. Although who knows? Despite regular invitations for him to call, write back or come by to play air hockey, he's never responded. But plenty of readers have. Some have been complimentary, like C.A. Mortenson. ""You know every time I get my mind set on something you guys come along and make me re-think things. Thanks."" Or Mary MacElveen ""Your letter is by far one of THE most thought-provoking and powerful letters I have read in a long time."" Or Moneca, ""Amen, Mr. Foreman. Amen."" It always makes me vaguely uncomfortable when someone calls me Mr. Foreman, btw. I prefer just Tom. At least, I prefer Tom to what some obviously want to call me. Like Mariah from Texas. ""Are you crazy?"" Or Helen when she finally found something she agreed with, presumably after a lot of reading. ""CNN should find a better job for you. That is the first letter you wrote that makes sense."" That made me laugh, because I've felt that way about other writers sometimes. Many readers have urged me to keep on, and others have begged me to stop. I appreciate them all. I have probably been most touched by people who simply express a heartfelt connection over the miles, like when I wrote about Michael Jackson's death and Windy responded, ""Thank you for such a nice letter, I feel the same way."" And I'm flattered when someone reposts a favorite, such as the letter I wrote about rebuilding New Orleans. Where is the safe house? I made a few simple rules for myself. First, I don't pick sides. I can offer analysis, ideas and general observations, but not conclusions beyond the common sense kind. Second, I try to be encouraging. Third, I respect the presidency. Although I write in a familiar tone, I never refer to President Obama (nor would I refer to any president) as ""my friend,"" or ""pal."" ""How long are you going to do this?"" That's the question so many people ask, and the honest answer is, ""I don't know."" Every time I reach a milestone like this one, I think I should call it quits. But I enjoy the process, heaven knows I need the practice writing and I don't want to disappoint the people who now count on these letters every day, including my mother. So on it goes. I have considered doing it for the rest of my life. I know it's not exactly the Lewis and Clark journals, but such letters, written concurrently with the events of our world, are an unusual historic record if nothing else. I will almost certainly continue through the next presidential election in 2012. And I'd hate to abandon the current president during the critical changeover from first term to second should he win, and if the White House passes into other hands ... well, why should the next president get a break?","CNN's Foreman started letters to Obama with inauguration .

"(CNN) -- The Argentine Football Association will not replace outgoing coach Diego Maradona before October, it announced on Wednesday. Sergio Batista, the coach of Argentina's under-20 team, will remain in temporary charge until then -- with his first match being the friendly against the Republic of Ireland in Dublin on August 11. The former international player, who took Argentina's under-23 team to a gold medal at the 2008 Olympics, will also take the side for the prestige friendly against world champions Spain in Buenos Aires on September 7. The new coach will be appointed after the AFA's annual meeting in October, the UK Press Association reported, and will take charge until the 2014 World Cup finals in Brazil. Maradona's contract was not renewed by the AFA after he refused to make changes to his backroom staff following the 2010 World Cup, where Argentina lost 4-0 to Germany in the quarterfinals. The 1986 World Cup winner accused AFA president Julio Grondona and general manager Carlos Bilardo of lying to him and betraying him. ""Grondona told me that he wanted me to continue as the coach, but that seven people from my coaching squad would have to go,"" the 49-year-old told reporters. ""That was impossible for me to agree to do. I have different codes and morals than they do; my parents taught me that.""","Diego Maradona's replacement as coach of Argentina's national team to be made in October .

"(CNN) -- Sonia, a single mother with HIV in Brazil, travels four hours to reach a government-run health facility that provides her with free drug treatment. Brazil's response to the HIV/AIDS fight has been widely praised and adopted as a model around the world. The journey is long, she told CNN, but it's a small price to pay for the government-provided drugs that have helped keep her out of the hospital for the past 11 years. Sonia is just one of the many Brazilians who have benefited from the country's novel approach to fighting the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Brazil jolted the global health community in 1996 when it began guaranteeing free anti-retroviral treatment to HIV/AIDS patients. For Sonia, government-funded treatment comes in the form of 20 pills. Taken daily, the anti-retroviral medicine has helped keep her HIV at bay. Coupled with government-supported prevention efforts and aggressive public awareness campaigns, the so-called Brazilian response has been hailed as a model for developing countries. Watch a report on Brazil's pioneering response to HIV/AIDS » . Prevention campaigns, which often take the forms of candid public awareness ads with slogans like ""Be good in bed, use a condom,"" have resulted in widespread knowledge of HIV. According to a recent study conducted by the country's Ministry of Health, Brazil boasts one of the highest rates of knowledge globally when it comes to HIV avoidance and transmittal. Brazil was ""the first country to realize there is no separation between prevention and treatment,"" Mauro Schechter, professor of infectious diseases at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, told CNN. Schechter, who has studied the HIV/AIDS epidemic since 1989, said it took the rest of the global health community some 15 years to realize that the two go hand-in-hand. Other countries that have adopted the Brazilian model » . The comprehensive response has extended the lives of tens of thousands of Brazilians and saved the government billions, researchers estimate. A recent study published by researchers from Brown University and the Harvard School of Public Health said that Brazil has saved $1 billion alone by producing its own generic versions of HIV/AIDS medicines and negotiating discounts for imported drugs. Those drug savings come on top of the estimated $2 billion the program has saved Brazil in hospital costs between 1996 and 2004. Brazil's efforts to reverse the tide of the AIDS epidemic have become the object of admiration in the global health community, but the trailblazer is encountering new challenges. When Brazil decided to guarantee free anti-retrovirals, there were 10,000 people being treated and it was organized as a program to treat a small amount of people for a limited amount of time, according to Schechter. Patients are living longer and oftentimes able to get their disease under control, thanks to combination therapies, better known as drug cocktails. But that means they also require drug treatment for a longer period of time. Furthermore, as HIV has evolved from an acute illness into a chronic disease, patients have also become vulnerable to other health risks and medical conditions. Valdileia Veloso is the director of the Institute of Clinical Research at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, a public health research institution in Rio de Janeiro. She told CNN patients are presenting with complications of chronic HIV and AIDS, which requires new treatment. ""It's a new challenge for us,"" she said. Heart disease is one of the big problems that doctors are encountering. While there's a system in place to prevent people from dying from HIV, preventable causes like heart conditions are causing deaths. ""These people are dying from preventable causes,"" Schechter told CNN. While Brazil has shown that providing universal access to treatment can be achieved, it needs to modify its approach to treat the evolving disease, he said. ""If the epidemic changes face, you need to adapt.""","Brazil has been hailed as a leader in the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic .

"OAKLAND, California (CNN) -- Richard Lee greets students, shopkeepers and tourists as he rolls his wheelchair down Broadway at the speed of a brisk jog, hailing them with, ""Hi. How ya doin'?"" Marijuana activist Richard Lee is a local celebrity in the small district of Oakland, California, called Oaksterdam. In this nine-block district of Oakland, California, called Oaksterdam, Lee is a celebrity. Oaksterdam is Lee's brainchild, a small pocket of urban renewal built on a thriving trade in medical marijuana. The district's name comes from a marriage of Oakland and Amsterdam, a city in the Netherlands renowned for its easy attitude toward sex and drugs. Lee is the founder of Oaksterdam University, which he describes as a trade school that specializes in all things marijuana: how to grow it, how to market it, how to consume it. The school, which has a curriculum, classes and teachers, claims 3,500 graduates. Lee also owns a medical marijuana dispensary, a coffee house, a large indoor marijuana plantation, and a museum/store devoted to the cause of legalizing marijuana. ""I really see this as following the history of alcohol. The way prohibition was repealed there,"" Lee says, adding that he believes he is close to achieving his mission. Lee is organizing a petition drive to place a marijuana legalization measure on the ballot in 2010, and he thinks the measure stands a good chance of being approved by voters. A recent California Field Poll showed that more than half the people in the state, where marijuana for medical use was approved more than a decade ago, would approve of decriminalizing pot. The state's faltering economy is one reason why. If legalized, marijuana could become California's No. 1 cash crop. It could bring in an estimated $1 billion a year in state taxes. Democratic State Assemblyman Tom Ammiano is spearheading a cannabis legalization bill in the California Assembly. He believes the state's need to increase tax revenues will work in his bill's favor. ""I think it's a seductive part of the equation,"" he says. Ammiano says there are a number of ways legalized pot could be marketed, ""It could be a Walgreens, it could be a hospital, a medical marijuana facility, whatever could be convenient. Adequate enforcement of the rules. Nobody under 21. No driving under the influence."" Even California's Republican governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, says legalizing marijuana deserves serious consideration. ""I think we ought to study very carefully what other countries are doing that have legalized marijuana,"" Schwarzenegger says. But Ammiano says selling a legalized marijuana bill to his fellow legislators remains a delicate matter. ""If we held the vote in the hallway, we'd have it done,"" Ammiano says. ""But people are necessarily cautious. They are up for re-election."" And that is why Lee believes voters will approve a marijuana initiative long before the state Assembly acts. Sitting under grow lights in a warehouse filled with hundreds of marijuana plants, Lee sums it up this way: ""For some people cannabis is like a religion. As passionate as some people are about their religions and freedom to think what they want and to worship as they want."" But all of that is baloney to Paul Chabot. He is president of the Coalition for a Drug Free California. He says voters should not be fooled by promises of big bucks flowing to the state from marijuana taxes. ""It's their way of sort of desensitizing our communities, our state and our nation to a drug problem that we clearly need to put our foot down on, and say, 'No more. Enough is enough.' "" Chabot points out that California's medical marijuana law has been poorly regulated, and he expects more of the same if marijuana becomes legalized for everyone. But a substantial number of Californians seem to believe that no amount of enforcement is going to make pot go away -- and that it's time for the state to begin taking a cut of the action.","Oaksterdam University specializes in how to grow, market and consume marijuana .

"(CNN) -- Four-time European champions Ajax scraped into Friday's Champions League draw after edging their third qualifying round tie on away goals. The Dutch team, who had to start in the opening preliminary stage of Europe's premier club competition after finishing second in the Eredivisie last season, drew 3-3 against Greek side PAOK Salonika on Wednesday night. Having been held 1-1 in the first leg in Amsterdam last week, Martin Jol's team went behind when Adelino Vieirinha scored in the 16th minute. Uruguay's World Cup star Luis Suarez leveled soon after halftime and the Ajax captain helped Siem de Jong put Ajax ahead from close range on 50 before Rasmus Lindgren made it 3-1 five minutes later. Dimitris Salpingidis pulled a goal back immediately, and Suarez hit the post, then Ajax's Netherlands goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg saved a late penalty from Vladimir Ivic, whose injury-time consolation goal came too late. In other results, Russian league leaders Zenit St. Petersburg knocked out last year's group stage qualifiers Unirea Urziceni of Romania, with Portugal international Danny scoring the only goal of the two ties 12 minutes before halftime. Scottish side Celtic, the 1967 European champions, failed to reach the group stage for the second time in two years despite beating Braga 2-1 at home, losing 4-2 on aggregate to the Portuguese league runners-up. Paulo Cesar added to debutants Braga's first-leg lead in the opening half, and goals to new signings Gary Hooper and Efrain Juarez were not enough to save Celtic. Swiss side Young Boys stunned Turkish league runners-up Fenerbahce, who had a player sent off in both legs before falling to a 3-2 aggregate defeat. Henri Bienvenu scored the only goal of Wednesday's match in Istanbul five minutes before halftime, then Miroslav Stoch was red-carded eight minutes after the restart. Hungarian side Debrecen also played in the first round proper last season, but will not this time after losing 3-1 at FC Basel for a 5-1 aggregate defeat by the Swiss champions. Sparta Prague made it through despite having two players sent off against Lech Poznan, with the Czech side winning 1-0 in Poland as Jiri Kladrubsky's 50th-minute penalty sealed a 2-0 overall victory. Sparta had Marek Matejovsky and Libor Sionko sent off in the final 10 minutes, while the hosts had captain Bartosz Bosacki ordered off. Danish champions Copenhagen won 3-2 against BATE Borisov to eliminate the only Belarusian team to have qualified for the group stage, back in 2008-09. After a goalless first leg in Belarus, the Danes led through Cesar Santin and William Kvist before Artyom Kontsevoi and Pavel Nekhaychik leveled and Vitali Rodionov hit the bar, but Dame N'Doye netted the winner. Serbia's Partizan Belgrade won 2-1 at Finnish side HJK Helsinki for a 5-1 aggregate victory, while Ukrainian runners-up Dinamo Kiev cruised into the next round with a 6-1 overall win against Belgian club Gent. Norwegian champions Rosenborg beat AIK Stockholm 3-0 for a 4-0 aggregate win over the Swedish league winners. While the third-round winners go into the hat for the chance to qualify for the lucrative group stage of the competition, won last May by Italy's Inter Milan, the losers will go into the draw for the playoffs of the second-tier Europa League.","Ajax win through to next qualifying round of Champions League on away goals .

"(CNN) -- Several people were injured in a ""flash fire"" at a plant in west-central Tennessee that makes decoy flares for the military, officials said Tuesday. The incident occurred at Kilgore Flares Co. in Hardeman County, about 75 miles northeast of Memphis, said Jeremy Heidt, spokesman for the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency. The plant in Toone, Tennessee, makes materials that are flammable but not explosive, Heidt said. United Kingdom-based Chemring Group, which owns Kilgore Flares, said the fire started at 12:30 p.m. in one of its ""expendable countermeasures assembly facilities."" Three hospitalized employees received burns and one was treated for stress, the company said. But hospitals said they were treating six people. ""Due to the nature of the materials involved, and its proximity to other materials, the emergency services consider it is best to let the fire burn itself out, Chemring said in a statement. ""Once the fire is extinguished, an investigation into the cause of the incident will be undertaken in cooperation with the local authorities."" The Regional Medical Center at Memphis has received three patients, two of them flown in, said executive secretary Jackie Harris. All three were in critical condition with unspecified injuries, she said. Three others were at Bolivar General Hospital in good condition, said spokeswoman Kay Cranford of West Tennessee Healthcare. A receptionist who answered the phone at Kilgore said no local spokesman was available. According to its website, Kilgore Flares makes decoy flares for aircraft and naval forces, many of which are used as countermeasures against heat-seeking missiles. Kilgore Flares is one of the county's largest employers, Hardeman County Mayor Willie Spencer said. A nearby elementary school was locked down after the early afternoon incident and several hundred Kilgore employees were sent home, Spencer said.

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Spanish police early Tuesday arrested nine people for suspected links to the Basque separatist group ETA, the first such detentions since ETA declared a unilateral cease-fire earlier this month, an Interior Ministry spokesman told CNN. Spain's Interior Minister said last week that police would not ease up on ETA, blamed for more than 800 deaths in its fight for Basque independence, despite its cease-fire declaration on September 5. The government and most Spanish political parties received ETA's cease-fire announcement with scepticism, because the group has used previous cease-fires to regroup its forces for subsequent shootings and bombings. In the predawn hours Tuesday, Civil Guards arrested five men and four women in various northern regions of Spain, including in the three provinces which comprise the Basque country. The nine are suspected of leading an outlawed group, Ekin, which authorities link directly to the outlawed ETA. The latter, in turn, is listed as a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union. Spain's National Court in 2007 convicted 47 people in a case that aimed to dismantle Ekin. At the time, the court called Ekin ""part of the heart"" of ETA, not a mere satellite group. The Supreme Court later overturned nine of those convictions.","The government has said it will not ease up on ETA despite ceasefire .

"(CNN) -- Captain Colin Montgomerie has picked Edoardo Molinari, Luke Donald and Padraig Harrington as wild cards to complete his European Ryder Cup team. Montgomerie's decision means English duo Paul Casey and Justin Rose both miss out on a place, despite Rose winning twice on the PGA Tour this season and Casey sitting ninth in the world rankings. Molinari, a European Tour rookie, secured his inclusion with a sparkling victory at the Johnnie Walker Classic, where he birdied the final three holes to win by a shot. The Italian takes his place in the team alongside brother Francesco as Europe try to regain the trophy from America -- the first time brothers will have competed in the Ryder Cup. Swede Peter Hanson and Spaniard Miguel Angel Jiminez both cemented their places in the team with their performances at the Gleneagles tournament. Harrington is included despite a disappointing year, though the Irishman did finish second at the Irish Open earlier this month and performed well in the opening three rounds of the Barclays tournament in New Jersey. Donald has had a solid year but boasts a strong Ryder Cup record. Those players join English trio Lee Westwood, Ian Poulter and Ross Fisher, Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell from Northern Ireland and Germany's Martin Kaymer in the 12-strong team. Montgomerie also announced that Spain's Sergio Garcia would be joining his team as a vice captain to work alongside existing trio Darren Clarke, Thomas Bjorn and Paul McGinley. Explaining his picks, Montgomerie told a press conference: ""Padraig Harrington has won three majors in the last three years. The stature of Padraig Harrington is such that we feel nobody in matchplay golf would want to play against him. He's a great competitor. ""Luke Donald is someone who can compete in the foursomes and fourballs and not just the singles. He's played seven times in the Ryder Cup and only lost once. ""And Edoardo Molinari, what can one say about his performance today? In my time on the European Tour, over 24 years, I don't think I've seen a finish of that quality under that pressure by anyone, ever. All credit to him, having to win and doing just that. ""We [the vice captains] are all unanimous in our decision that we have the strongest possible team for Europe. I just want to think positively about the team that we have selected. I think the three picks are strong in every way. ""Since my day -- I was a Ryder Cup rookie in 1991 -- I don't think any captain has had the difficulty I have had today picking three from a possible ten.""

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid midfielder Kaka is facing a spell of up to four months on the sidelines after undergoing knee surgery, the Spanish club have confirmed. The Brazil star had been with Jose Mourinho's side on their pre-season tour of the United States but left their base in Los Angeles to travel to see a knee specialist in Belgium. Kaka had a disappointing World Cup with his country, as they were knocked out in the quarterfinal by Netherlands, and was troubled by a groin injury during the tournament in South Africa. He joined Real Madrid from Italian giants AC Milan in June 2009 for a then world record fee of $88 million but only made 22 appearances as his new club finished second to champions Barcelona. The half hour operation in Antwerp on Thursday morning was hailed as a success but Real fans may have to wait until December to see the 28-year-old back in action. A statement on the club's official website read: ""The operation performed on the left knee of Real Madrid C.F.'s Ricardo Izecson Dos Santos Leite 'Kaka' by Dr. Marc Martens at Antwerp's AZ Monica Hospital was a success. ""The arthroscopic surgery confirmed an injury to the left meniscus with minimal inflammation of the cartilage. The player is expected to miss three to four months."" Cristiano Ronaldo scored the winner as Real Madrid beat Mexican side Club America 3-2 on their warm up tour of the U.S. and afterwards Mourinho told reporters the club could cope in Kaka's absence. ""It's no big deal if we have to lose him for a while,"" he said. ""We have other players and that is that. He is one of the best players in the world. ""Kaka is loved by all his teammates and he is an excellent player, but we want him to be 100 per cent so that he is happy.""

"(Entertainment Weekly) -- Jaden Smith is getting a small taste of what it's like to walk in dad Will's action-blockbuster shoes. Keanu Reeves stars in the remake of the 1951 sci-fi flick ""The Day the Earth Stood Still."" As expected, the remake of the 1951 sci-fi flick starring Keanu Reeves easily replaced ""Four Christmases"" atop the box office leader board with an opening weekend gross of $31 million, according to Sunday's estimates. Despite mediocre reviews, the film held fairly steady throughout the weekend, falling slightly shy of our $36 million estimate. The Vince Vaughn-Reese Witherspoon yuletide comedy came in second with $13.3 million, bringing its three-week total to just under $88 million, while ""Twilight"" faded to the third spot during its fourth week with just over $8 million. The teen vampire romance managed to reach one milestone, however, grossing a total of $150 million -- the amount director Catherine Hardwicke surmised the movie would have to suck in for sequel ""New Moon"" to get the go ahead. Obviously, Summit executives saw the writing on the wall weeks ago and have hired Chris Weitz (""About a Boy,"" ""American Pie"") to direct next fall's follow-up. Rounding out the top five are Disney's doggie flick ""Bolt"" with $7.5 million and Baz Luhrmann's underperforming ""Australia"" with $4.3 million. The weekend's other new major release -- ""Nothing Like the Holidays,"" starring John Leguizamo and Debra Messing -- got coal in its stocking with a measly $3.5 million during its first weekend. Also of note is the Clint Eastwood-starring ""Gran Torino"" (rumored to be the actor-director's last turn in front of the camera). Although it opened in only six theaters (three in New York, three in L.A.), the film scored the best per screen average, $47,333, with a gross of only $284,000.

"(CNN)  -- Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi announced his retirement from Test cricket after his side slumped to a 150-run defeat to Australia at Lord's on Friday. It was a thumping victory for Australia in the first Test of a two-match series, being held in England because of the security situation in Pakistan. Afridi, who was dismissed for two runs in the second innings, revealed his decision in the post-match interview, saying he no longer had the temperament required for the longest form of the game. ""I've not been fully fit with a side strain and so I will not play Test cricket after the match in Leeds,"" Afridi told gathered reporters. Afridi, nicknamed ""Boom Boom"" because of his big-hitting exploits in one-day and Twenty20 cricket, had only just returned to the Test arena after a four-year absence to take over the captaincy of a youthful Pakistan side. He had been criticized for his carefree tactics in the first innings, hitting 31 in quick fire time before attempting one big hit too many and being caught. Pakistan, chasing a world record fourth innings victory total of 440, were bowled out for 289, with Salman Butt, who is likely to replace Afridi as Test captain, top scoring with 92. When he was dismissed by part-time off spinner Marcus North, the Pakistan effort faltered. North eventually finished with a six wickets for 55 runs -- with Afridi one of his victims -- as well as promising young middle-order batsman Umar Akmal. It was Australia's 13th straight Test win over Pakistan. The second Test starts at Headingley next Wednesday which is set to be Afridi's farewell. Yawar Saeed, the Pakistan tour manager, told AFP: ""Yes, he has told us he is not feeling comfortable with the injury and has told us he doesn't want to play (Tests) but we will talk to him and then decide."" Pakistan have been forced to play their international cricket abroad since gunmen attacked a coach carrying the Sri Lanka team at a Test match in Lahore in March 2009.","Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi quits Test cricket after thumping defeat to Australia .

Watson came from six behind on the final round to card a 66 as he went into extra holes with fellow Americans Corey Pavin and Scott Verplank as all finished on 14-under-par. Ryder Cup captain Pavin went out at the first sudden death hole and Verplank found trouble at the second, leaving Watson to two-putt for a par on the short 15th. Watson's father is battling cancer and he was foremost in this thoughts after his triumph. ""I want to thank my dad and mom because without them I would be nothing. My dad is battling cancer now. 'Dad I am praying for you. I love you,"" he told gathered reporters. Watson had to survive a double bogey on the 17th in regulation play before he birdied the final hole to make the playoff.

"(CNN) -- Three-time champions Germany marched into the semifinals of the World Cup after destroying Diego Maradona's highly-rated Argentina side 4-0 on Saturday in a rematch of the 1986 and 1990 title matches. Veteran striker Miroslav Klose celebrated his 100th international appearance with two goals in Cape Town, taking him level second in the tournament's all-time scoring list alongside compatriot Gerd Muller on 14. Thomas Muller, one of the finds of the month-long football showpiece, headed the opening goal inside the third minute, his fourth of the South African tournament, while Arne Friedrich bundled home his first in 76 internationals to make it 3-0. Maradona told reporters after the match that he was unsure about his future with Argentina, who also lost to Germany at the same stage in a penalty shootout in 2006. ""We will see what happens. I haven't thought about leaving. I have to check that with my family and the players, and there are things I have to consider,"" he said. ""But as coach and player, the type of football people like is this one. Touch the ball, rotate, run -- Argentina can't play a different style."" The star-studded Argentina team rarely looked like breaking down the well-organized German line-up, and when they did put the ball in the net in the 36th minute Gonzalo Higuain was clearly offside. Argentina's world player of the year Lionel Messi now goes home without having scored a goal at the event, having come into it with huge expectations surrounding him. Germany will next face European champions Spain, who beat Paraguay 1-0 in Saturday's final last-eight tie. Muller will miss that match due to suspension after picking up his second booking. ""The fact that we won't have him is a serious blow because he has shown how dangerous he is,"" Germany coach Joachim Low later told reporters in quotes carried by AFP. ""I saw his yellow and don't see why he got it. The ball touches his thigh then his arm from a short distance. I really question the yellow. ""But in the past we have been able to replace people like Muller and we will continue to do so as we move forward."" The 20-year-old, who has played only seven international matches, glanced in an early header from Bastian Schweinsteiger's teasing cross which Argentina goalkeeper Sergio Romero could only deflect into the net with his right leg. Muller then presented Klose with a glorious chance to make it 2-0, but the 32-year-old blazed his shot over the bar. The South Americans thought they had equalized when Tevez fed the ball to Higuain, but at least four Argentines were in offside positions in the build-up play. Klose, who spent most of last season on the substitutes' bench at German champions Bayern Munich while Muller grabbed the headlines, made it 2-0 from close range in the 68th minute after being set up by Lukas Podolski. The 31-year-old Friedrich killed off Argentina with 16 minutes to play after Schweinsteiger waltzed past three defenders and laid on a perfect pass for his teammate. Coach Maradona -- who led Argentina to victory as captain against the Germans in Mexico in 1986 but suffered defeat in Italy four years after that -- took off right-back Nicolas Otomendi, who struggled to fill what has been a problem position for the team throughout the tournament. He also brought on striker Sergio Aguero, but Germany continued the clinical counter-attacking display that so ruthlessly ended England's hopes in the previous round as Klose moved to within a goal of Brazil star Ronaldo on the all-time list with an 89th-minute volley from Mesut Ozil's cross.","Miroslav Klose scores twice as Germany thrash Argentina 4-0 in Cape Town .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has stopped well short of agreeing to a continued freeze on building Israeli settlements in the West Bank, made comments that suggested that he might be willing to compromise on the issue. Construction of settlements is a major sticking point between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, which recently resumed direct peace talks for the first time since 2008. ""The Palestinians are demanding that after the 26th of September there will be zero growth in the West Bank, and that won't happen,"" Netanyahu said during a Sunday meeting with Middle East Quartet Representative Tony Blair, a diplomatic source briefed on the discussions told CNN. The Quartet consists of the United States, Russia, the United Nations and the European Union. ""Israel will not be able to continue with the moratorium,"" Netanyahu said. ""On one hand, we won't be building all the tens of thousands of housing units that are waiting in the pipeline, but on the other hand we won't be freezing the lives of the inhabitants of the West Bank when we won't freeze the building."" ""I don't know if there will be a comprehensive freeze,"" Netanyahu said at a Sunday Cabinet meeting, according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. ""But I also don't know if it is necessary to construct all of the 20,000 housing units waiting to be built. In any case, between zero and one there are a lot of possibilities."" Last year, Israel instituted a 10-month moratorium on building Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Netanyahu is under pressure from the Palestinians and the from the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama to extend the freeze, which is currently set to expire toward the end of September. Netanyahu's conservative coalition government wants the prime minister to end the moratorium. An Israeli settlement watch organization called Peace Now says groundwork construction already is complete on 2,000 Israeli housing units in the West Bank, on which building could resume as soon as the moratorium ends. Another 11,000 units have been approved for construction, according to the group. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Netanyahumet in Washington for direct talks earlier this month. The two pledged in front of the cameras to move the peace process forward, but privately were said to have gotten stuck on the question of whether the Israeli settlements should continue. Abbas and Netanyahu are scheduled for a meeting Tuesday in Egypt, where U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and George Mitchell, the U.S. special envoy for Middle East peace, are also expected to attend. Netanyahu said that if all sides are serious in their efforts, it would be possible to arrive at a framework for lasting peace within the year. ""Just as we are asked to recognize the Palestinian national state ... we also demand and expect the Palestinians to recognize a Jewish state, the State of Israel, as the national state of the Jewish People. This is the true foundation of peace,"" he said, according to Haaretz. Palestinian negotiators have said they will walk away from peace talks if Israel resumes settlement construction in the West Bank. ""I'm not demanding as a pre-condition for talks the recognition of Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people, and I don't say that, if they don't do so, I will stand up and leave the negotiating table,"" Netanyahu said, according to the diplomatic source. ""In the same fashion, it's not logical that the Palestinians are placing pre-conditions and threatening to leave the negotiating table. That is not the way to move forward seriously to a peace agreement.""

"JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNN) -- A U.S. mining company has denied a report by Indonesia's state media that a convoy of its buses came under fire in the province of Papua Wednesday. Indonesian soldiers provide security near a PT Freeport-owned gold mine in Timika, Papua province, on July 18. The state-run Antara News Agency had said that two people were reportedly killed when a 12-bus convoy carrying employees of PT Freeport was attacked by unidentified gunmen in the country's eastern-most province. The company clarified that a vehicle was wrecked in the province, killing one person and wounding several others. When police and mechanics drove to the area to assist, shots were fired at them. Three people were hurt in the shooting, the company said. ""No shots were fired at the PT-FI bus convoy as earlier reported,"" the company said. Following the company's comments, Antara's Web site changed its report to reflect the new information. PT Freeport is the largest copper and gold mining company in the province. Attacks directed at the company killed an Australian mine technician and two Indonesians on July 11 and 12. And two directors of the company were wounded Friday in a twin attack at the Ritz Carlton and JW Marriott hotels in the capital Jakarta. Papua residents have long resented the presence of PT Freeport in the province. They have criticized the environmental impact of the mining operations and the small share of revenues the province receives. In 2008, a separatist group claimed responsibility for a series of bomb attacks in the area. No one died in the attacks, Antara said. In 2002, two American teachers and an Indonesian colleague who worked at the mine were shot dead in an attack, the news agency said. Meanwhile, authorities on Wednesday released sketches of two men believed to have carried out the bombings at the luxury hotels in Jakarta. One was about 40; the other 17, officials said. Analysis of their DNA matched those obtained from a homemade explosive found in a room at the Marriott where they had checked in, police said. But authorities still do not know their identities.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Two of nine mortars fired from Gaza into Israel on Wednesday contained white phosphorous, Israeli police told CNN. Bomb disposal experts examined the mortars and confirmed that two contained white phosphorous, a police spokesman said. It was not the first time that Hamas has attempted to target Israel using mortars containing white phosphorous, the spokesman said. White phosphorus ignites and burns, creating white smoke when it is exposed to oxygen. Militaries use it as a smoke screen to protect troops during combat. If it comes in contact with skin, however, white phosphorus creates an intense and persistent burn. Israel itself has been roundly criticized for firing white phosphorus shells over densely populated areas during the Gaza offensive that began in late 2008. However, in a July report to the United Nations, Israel pledged to limit the use of munitions containing white phosphorus and to make greater efforts to protect civilians during conflicts. The latest allegations and violence come amid a fresh round of Middle East peace talks that began Tuesday in Egypt and continued Wednesday in Jerusalem.","Bomb experts examined the mortars .

"(CNN) -- Last Thursday was back-to-school night in many of the communities that dot the peninsula below San Francisco, California. Off-duty firefighters and police officers who went to schools with their children and families soon learned something horrible had happened in a San Bruno residential neighborhood. Speculation ran from an airplane crash, to an earthquake, to terrorism. It was only later that they learned that is was a gas transmission line explosion. South San Francisco firefighter Anthony Ottoboni was at his son's baseball practice when he got the news. ""My wife looked right at me and said, 'Go.'"" Capt. Bill Forester of the San Bruno Fire Department was on duty. ""We looked out the back door and saw a fireball,"" he said. John Priolo, also with the fire department, recalls rushing to work and seeing the ""walking wounded"" arrive at the station. Tuesday, first-responders gathered near the fire site to talk about the heroics of others, including citizens, last week. They spoke of the strong fraternity of the 400 firefighters, paramedics and police officers who thronged to the neighborhood. They mentioned how their training prepared them, but there are some things training can't foresee. ""Somebody said it was like they took a Saturn V rocket and tipped it upside down at the blastoff,"" said Forester. The high-pitched roar of gas sounded like a jet engine, he added. Chaos greeted them as they moved into the area. Many people were running away. Bystanders were taking photos. Always, there was the wall of fire and oppressive heat. ""I realized immediately how overwhelmed we were going to be,"" said Sgt. Mike Guldner of the San Bruno Police Department. Guldner and some civilians helped a seriously injured man. ""Thank God to the people and citizens of San Bruno who stepped up to provide assistance to me,"" Guldner said. Firefighters quickly learned the water mains had been taken out by the explosion. ""It's a sinking feel to say the least because you count on that water being there,"" said Forester. ""If there was ever a time you need it, it was there."" But firefighters improvised, stretching lines from another water grid. The responders, many of whom knew people who lived in the Crestmoor Canyon neighborhood, went to smoke-filled homes, making sure people got out. They were assisted by several residents. ""We got as close to the flame as we possibly can without getting ourselves burned,"" said Officer Ken Chetcuti of the South San Francisco Police. Lt. Ron Carlino of the South Francisco Police Department recalled the dazed homeowners who grabbed a few belongings. ""Some people wanted to grab just anything,"" he said. ""They felt like they couldn't leave empty-handed."" Four people died in the fire and three are still missing, officials said Tuesday. Thirty-seven homes were destroyed. Homeowners have since returned to Crestmoor Canyon and are trying to patch their lives back together. But the people of San Bruno have changed, according to local police officer Scott Rogge. ""We had everyday people running into houses, helping us,"" he said. Since then, the community has received and given donations, opened a shelter, provided food, clothing and more. ""People that normally you see maybe wave -- they are exchanging emails, phone numbers, hugs and tears,"" Rogge said. ""Those are the true heroes, the people of the community... We do this every day. We've chosen to do this. But those people stepped up.""","Residents assisted firefighters and police officers in San Bruno .

"Srinagar, India (CNN) -- Four people were killed and eight others wounded Wednesday when police fired on demonstrators in the town of Mendhar in India's Jammu and Kashmir state, a local official said. Later, in the northern Kashmiri town of Sobore, police opened fire to quell stone-pelting protesters. One person was critically injured and later died in hospital, police said. The protests, triggered by allegations of the desecration of the Quran in the United States, quickly turned into the violent anti-India demonstrations that have taken place all summer in India's restive Kashmir region. Monday was the bloodiest day yet: 18 people were killed and 80 others wounded in demonstrations against India and the United States. Protesters torched two Christian missionary schools and several government buildings, after which the Indian government imposed a round-the-clock curfew, forcing a complete lock-down on the region and creating shortages in essential items including baby food, milk and produce. All flights in and out of Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir state, were suspended for the first time in a decade. Indian police were out in force on the streets of Srinagar, keeping residents hunkered down in their homes. But demonstrations in support of Kashmiri independence have continued and police have met angry crowds with the force of batons and the sting of teargas. So far this summer, 89 people have died in anti-India demonstrations in Kashmir, the predominantly Muslim part of Jammu and Kashmir state where many favor severing ties with New Delhi. Divisional Commissioner Pawan Kotwal told CNN that protesters tried to burn down another school run by Christian missionaries in Mendhar, a Muslim town southwest of Srinagar that is in the predominantly Hindu area of the state. He said an indefinite curfew has also been imposed in Mendhar.","The anti-India protests were fueled by Quran desecration reports .

"(CNN) -- Prosecutors in Boston, Massachusetts, say they plan to release their files on accused ""Craigslist killer"" Philip Markoff, who killed himself in jail in August, after formally dropping the murder case against him Thursday. The Suffolk County District Attorney's office said Wednesday it plans to file paperwork requesting a dismissal of their case Thursday morning. The case was short-circuited when Markoff took his own life August 15, but District Attorney Daniel Conley said at the time that the evidence against the suspect was ""overwhelming."" Conley is slated to discuss the case with reporters Thursday morning after requesting the case be dropped, a move his office said will set the stage for the release of ""all relevant documents"" at an unspecified later date. ""Prosecutors are currently reviewing and redacting those documents and assembling the physical evidence,"" the district attorney's office said in a statement issued Wednesday. ""We expect that it will be ready for media review within the next few weeks."" Markoff, 24, was a second-year student at Boston University's School of Medicine when arrested in April 2009 in the killing of Julissa Brisman, 25, at Boston's Copley Marriott Hotel. Police said that Brisman, a model, advertised as a masseuse on the online classifieds service Craigslist, and Markoff might have met her through the site. Authorities said Markoff killed himself in his jail cell by cutting himself multiple times with a makeshift scalpel crafted from a pen and a piece of metal. In addition, a large, clear plastic bag of a type issued to inmates was fastened around his neck with a piece of gauze. The name of his former fiancee, who called off their wedding after his arrest, was scrawled in what appeared to be blood on the wall of his cell when he was found, Conley told reporters at the time.","District attorney to file for dismissal after suspect Markoff's suicide .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A key witness in the Anna Nicole Smith drug trial denied Wednesday that she was coached by the prosecutor on testimony the defense argued is false. The judge is considering striking the testimony of one of Smith's former nannies after a defense lawyer accused the prosecution of ""suborning perjury"" -- coaching the witness to lie. The judge also released dozens of personal photos of the actress with her infant daughter, Dannielynn, and boyfriend-lawyer Howard K. Stern. The defense showed the pictures to jurors to counter the argument that Smith was drugged during much of her last months. Stern and Drs. Khristine Eroshevich and Sandeep Kapoor are on trial for allegedly conspiring to provide drugs to an addict and using false names on prescriptions for Smith. The trial, in its seventh week, took a dramatic turn Wednesday when defense attorney Steve Sadow accused prosecutor Renee Rose of knowingly having Nadine Alexie, a former Smith nanny, lie on the stand. ""The people (prosecution) know this is fraudulent,"" Sadow said at the end of the direct testimony of Alexie. If Judge Robert Perry accepts a defense motion to strike the entire testimony of the nanny, it would be a major blow to an already staggered prosecution case. ""I am thinking about it,"" Judge Perry said. He already ordered the jury to ignore a portion of the testimony of Alexie's sister-in-law, Quethelie Alexis, because he found it unreliable. Alexie and Alexis were supposed to be star witnesses for the prosecution. They both worked for Smith in the Bahamas for several months after the birth of her daughter in September 2006. They were fired two months before Smith died in a Florida hotel in February 2007. The two nannies, both Haitians who live in the Bahamas, have recanted key portions of statements they made earlier concerning Smith's drug use in the last months of her life. On Wednesday, Alexie recanted an earlier statement that she had seen Stern melt pills in a soup spoon and then inject the drug into Smith during cross-examination Wednesday. Instead, Alexie said she only saw a spoon that appeared to be burned in Smith's bathroom. She assumed it had used that way ""because I saw it on TV"" in a movie. She also backed away from earlier testimony that she had been threatened by unknown people, which prompted her to go into hiding a week after Smith's February 2007 death. She explained Wednesday that she became afraid after getting phone calls at her home from CNN's Larry King and Fox News. She and her sister-in-law had both testified that they demanded the prosecution pay to relocate them to new homes in the Bahamas as a condition for their testimony. Fear for their safety was the reason, they both said. ""I tell them (if) I come to testify I'm going to need to move from where I am,"" Alexie said. The defense has also highlighted other financial benefits the Los Angeles district attorney has given the women in order to convince them to fly to the United States to testify. The prosecution not only paid for the two witnesses to travel to Los Angeles, but they were allowed to bring seven other family members at taxpayer expense. ""I tell them I would not leave my family behind,"" Alexie said. A nephew tagged along with her three children and her husband. Quethelie Alexis brought her two children with her. Prosecutor Rose worked to convince jurors that the taxpayer-funded trip has been no luxury vacation, given as a reward for testimony. The children have not been taken to Disneyland or even a movie in the eight days they've been staying in a Los Angeles hotel, Alexie testified. They've stuck close to the hotel watching television and swimming in the pool, Alexie said. The only outing was for two hours to a ""little park"" on Sunday, she testified. Judge Perry has suggested several times in recent weeks that the prosecution had fallen short so far in proving the core of its case, including that Smith was a drug addict. The defense contends that Smith suffered chronic pain, justifying the drug prescriptions in question. ""If she's being treated for pain, it's not illegal,"" Judge Perry said Tuesday.","NEW: The court released dozens of personal photos of Anna Nicole Smith .

"San Bruno, California (CNN) -- Pacific Gas & Electric planned in 2009 to replace a section of its gas pipeline just a couple of miles from the section that exploded last week in San Bruno, California, but never spent the $5 million of rate increases to do the work, a consumer watchdog group said Wednesday. And further, said TURN [The Utility Reform Network], the utility asked for another $5 million for the same project in 2009 -- the year it should have completed the work it hasn't even started -- saying it wouldn't be completed until 2013. ""The money was spent on what they call higher priority work,"" said TURN senior attorney Mike Florio. ""You can't track the dollars one by one, but we do know they spent $62 million more on management incentive business than they had forecast in 2009,"" he said. ""They spent $60 million on going back and re-doing gas leak surveys that they had botched elsewhere on their system."" PG&E responded that it ""is committed to performing the work necessary to assure the safety of its gas transmission system."" The utility said it had identified the line section as a ""high priority project"" in the earlier transmission rate filing, but ""rescheduled the project"" after an updated assessment in 2009. But the company did not explain why it needed an additional $5 million and three years to complete repairs on a section it said in its most recent rate filing was in the top 100 risks for failure. ""Coupled with the consequences of failure of this section of pipeline, the likelihood of a failure makes the risk of a failure at this location unacceptably high,"" the company said in that filing. TURN officials think they know where some of the money went -- in 2009, the year PG&E didn't spend $5 million on fixing the pipeline, the company did spend $5 million on bonuses for six top executives. ""The company's priorities appear to be skewed,"" TURN executive director Mark Toney said. The line that exploded in San Bruno was laid down in 1948, as was the section PG&E was supposed to replace. In the first filing, the utility noted that the ""vintage 30-inch pipeline"" runs through ""several High Consequence Areas."" In the second, it said the pipeline was ""located in a heavily urbanized area."" Four people were killed in Thursday's explosion and fire in the San Francisco suburb, and three are still missing. The blast blew in the doors of a grocery store a quarter-mile (400 meters) away, and the explosion and resulting fire injured 52 people and destroyed 37 homes. The explosion blew a 28-foot section of the pipeline 100 feet in the air. In the filing documents -- provided by TURN -- the section of pipe to be replaced is identified as in the top 100 for highest risks of failure. And since exact locations of pipelines are generally kept secret because of terrorism threats, residents may not even know they live near one until it's too late. ""If they fixed that section that they said wanted to fix maybe they would have found something that led them to look a mile or two south of there,"" Florio said. ""We don't know that. We do know that the project was slated for 2009. It didn't get done. Now they're proposing to do it again in 2013."" The California Public Utilities Commission has not made a decision on this latest increase request. PG&E has agreed to set up a $100 million fund to help rebuild parts of San Bruno.","Pacific Gas & Electric got $5 million to replace pipeline in 2009 .

To Western eyes more used to the region portrayed through images of religion, conflict or conservative societies, it may come as a surprise to learn these photographs represent a snapshot of life in the Middle East. But these and 300,000 more gathered in an archive in Beirut tell a different story: One of a long-forgotten belle epoque of glamour and innocence. This sprawling photographic collection is the work of the Arab Image Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated safeguarding a local perspective often overshadowed by the works of Western photographers. ""We were interested in showing the Arab world as we know it; as we see it in our photographic album,"" foundation director Zeina Arida told CNN. This lovingly-curated collection boasts many gems, not least the noir-ish work of Van Leo, an Armenian-Egyptian portrait photographer who attracted the rich and famous to his Cairo studio. Active during the 1940s and 50s, Van Leo also pursued his own artistic vision, posing for fantasy self-portraits, re-imagining himself as a heroic pilot, prisoner -- or even a chiffon-robed young woman. Says Arida, Van Leo, whose work predates similar projects by celebrated American photographer Cindy Sherman by almost 40 years, is among several ""enthusiastic"" supporters of the 13-year-old foundation. But, with most of its funding coming from Europe and the United States, she says more Middle Eastern donors, who tend to back charitable rather than cultural organizations, need to step up to help preserve their own past. The foundation's new research center in Beirut, where white-gloved curators carefully handle the slides, plates, prints and negatives that make up the collection, should help, she says. It is hoped the research will offer new insight, not only into a golden era for the region, but also into the techniques of those who strove to capture it. Adds Arida: ""We do have important historical documents, but the main interest in these images were what the images can tell us about the relationship between the photographer and his clients.""

"JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNN) -- Search crews have rescued nine more passengers who survived a ferry capsizing off the coast of Indonesia, though more than 230 people are still missing. A woman grieves after learning her son is one of the victims in the Indonesian ferry accident. The nine survivors were rescued by a navy ship Monday afternoon, bringing the total number of survivors from Sunday's accident to 30, said Col. Jaka Santosa, chief of search and rescue operations for the Indonesian navy. One body was also recovered Monday. The search and rescue operations continued Tuesday, with five navy ships joining the effort. The ferry was carrying 267 people. Rescue efforts have been hampered by severe weather, including heavy rains and strong winds, according to local officials. The Teratai Prima ferry left Pare Pare on Sulawesi island in central Indonesia on Saturday evening for Samarinda, East Kalimantan. The ferry overturned about 4 a.m. Sunday off the coast of Majena in west Sulawesi after being pummeled with waves as high as 19 feet, survivors said. Indonesians rely heavily on ferries, since they are the easiest way to navigate throughout the country's 17,000 islands.

"(CNN) -- A spokeswoman for a group headed by Nobel Peace laureate Shirin Ebadi has been arrested by Iranian authorities less than 48 hours before the country marks the first anniversary of its election fallout, according to a human rights group. Narges Mohammadi, a member of Ebadi's Defenders of Human Rights Center -- known as Iran's leading human rights group -- was arrested overnight at her Tehran home, the U.S.-based International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran reported Friday. No information is available about the arrest of Mohammadi, whose whereabouts are unknown, said Hadi Ghaemi, a spokesman for the campaign. Ghaemi noted that a television program on an official Iranian station aired a segment Friday attacking Ebadi's character and her human rights record. The program included clips of Ebadi's husband, who was arrested after the June 12, 2009, elections and released, making disparaging remarks about his wife. Her husband, Javad Tavasolian, was ""subjected to physical and psychological abuse"" while he was detained, the Human Rights Campaign in Iran said. ""He was videotaped while in detention and coerced to make defamatory statements about her. He informed Ebadi about his ill treatment after his release."" Ebadi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003, has been a vocal critic of Iran's human rights record, especially in the aftermath of last year's election. Thousands were arrested during the mass demonstrations that followed -- including former lawmakers, political activists, local and international journalists, filmmakers and foreign nationals -- and hundreds were accused of engaging in a ""soft revolution"" and tried in court. In a commentary published on CNN.com Friday, Ebadi stated, ""Most recently, in order to put more pressure on political and social dissidents, and in addition to regular arrests, the Iranian government has resorted to other tactics. For example, the government has been taking hostage and imprisoning the close relatives of these individuals to inflict more intimidation and psychological pressure, in order to have their demands met."" She named her sister, Nushin Ebadi, a dentistry professor who was detained for 17 days in December, among the examples of those arrested without cause. The Islamic government has steadily been tightening its grip throughout the year, said a report issued Thursday by Human Rights Watch, a group that also has been monitoring the situation through interviews with people in Iran. The government and police have issued warnings to Iranians not to participate in any gatherings Saturday, and opposition leaders called off protests to mark the anniversary for fear of another crackdown. Human Rights Watch said the atmosphere inside the country is markedly different from the images of defiance that filled the internet and television screens starting a year ago. ""While the international community has focused on Iran's nuclear ambitions, Tehran has been methodically crushing all forms of dissent inside the country,"" Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, told CNN this week. ""Journalists, lawyers, and civil society activists who used to speak to foreign media and human rights groups are increasingly reluctant, fearing phone and internet surveillance,"" he said in a statement released with the latest report. The rights group says Iran's crackdown extends beyond election protesters. The 19-page report lists abuses including arbitrary arrests, extrajudicial killings, rapes, torture and violations of the rights to freedom of assembly and expression. Scores of journalists and human rights activists have been targeted, the report says, and the government has executed at least seven Kurdish political dissidents, while more than a dozen sit on death row. Iran has defended its record before the U.N. Human Rights Council. Mohammad Javad Larijani, the secretary general of Iran's High Council for Human Rights, has said that the government goes after only those who incite violence. ""Nobody is jailed because of the protest,"" Larijani said in February. ""The only reason for jailing is the violence which was attached with the protests. Any government has a duty to bring an end to the violence. I think the beating of our police is much more less than the New York and Los Angeles police.""","Associate of Nobel Peace laureate Shirin Ebadi arrested in Iran .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: As the three-day weekend was winding down, we were here at the CNN Center last night, putting together your Tuesday edition of CNN Student News. You know who I am; let's get right to today's headlines! First Up: Afghan Offensive . AZUZ: Making progress, but there's still a long way to go. That is how one reporter in Afghanistan described a military offensive there. The goal of Operation Moshtarak, which means ""together"" in the local language, is for coalition and Afghan troops to work together in order to remove the Taliban from Helmand province. The militant group has a strong presence in that region. And this is the largest military operation since 2001, when the war in Afghanistan started. It includes about 15,000 troops. And one thing they're trying to do is draw Taliban fighters into combat. Commanders say they expect that to last a while. But one of the challenges in fighting the Taliban is doing so without hurting civilians. On Sunday, 12 Afghan civilians were killed when a coalition rocket hit the building they were in. Military officials said the troops were aiming for the right building; what they didn't know is that there were civilians inside of it. Challenges Abroad . AZUZ: The war in Afghanistan is just one of the challenges facing President Obama right now. Another one: Iran. Over the weekend, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she believes that the Middle Eastern nation is becoming a ""military dictatorship,"" and she thinks that could be dangerous for other countries. Jill Dougherty examines that issue and some of the other global challenges facing the U.S. president. (BEGIN VIDEO) JILL DOUGHERTY, CNN FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Two costly wars, an economy still reeling, no health care reform yet, and a political upset in Massachusetts torpedoes his Senate supermajority. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We're trying to, you know, bring some change that you can believe in. DOUGHERTY: With his change agenda bogged down at home, what hope is there for President Obama's change agenda abroad? DOUG PAAL, CARNEGIE FOUNDATION FOR INTL. PEACE: When American presidents get weak at home, it really does affect their ability to act abroad. DOUGHERTY: In his first year, Mr. Obama visited 21 countries. His mantra: engagement, even with your enemies. HILLARY CLINTON, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: It's almost hard to remember how poorly much of the world viewed the United States when President Obama came into office. DOUGHERTY: The secretary of state says she sees a lot of positive trends. But the score card, so far, is mixed. Iran still hounds its opponents and defends its nuclear program, now boasting it's enriching its own uranium. North Korea still won't return to nuclear talks. The Mideast peace process is stalled. Even the president's friends say America's credibility is on the line. KING ABDULLAH II, JORDAN: I personally believe that the president is extremely committed to it, but we also know that America is dealing with many other issues internally, health plan, other issues. Massachusetts was, I think, something that hit the news. DOUGHERTY: But after the reset button was pressed with Russia, relations did improve. Moscow is helping the U.S. to pressure Iran and it's close to a new arms control agreement with Washington. But in Beijing, cyber attacks against U.S. companies like Google, disputes over arm sales to Taiwan, and a controversial visit to the White House this week by the Dalai Lama have relations with China at a boil. Surprisingly, the administration does claim one success, in a war Barack Obama opposed. U.S. VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I am very optimistic about Iraq. I think it's going to be one of the great achievements of this administration. ROBERT GIBBS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Putting what was broken back together and getting our troops home, which we intend to do in August of this year. (END VIDEO) Luge Accident . AZUZ: When we recorded this show last night, the U.S. was leading the medal count at the 2010 Winter Olympics. But the Vancouver games got off to a tragic start. A 21-year-old Olympian from the Republic of Georgia, a country between Russia and Turkey, died in an accident on the luge track. A memorial was set up for Nodar Kumaritashvili. Just a couple hours before the opening ceremonies, he was on his last training run at the Whistler Sliding Center when he lost control of his sled and crashed. The International Luge Federation said the crash happened because Kumaritashvili didn't make up for a mistake he'd made on his run. A lot of people are afraid this course was just too fast, and since the crash, Olympics workers have shortened it and made it safer by building up the walls near where the crash happened. Multi-Car Pile-Up . AZUZ: It's been relatively warm in Vancouver, but winter weather is taking a toll on parts of the U.S. Look at this pile-up that shut down a Kansas overpass on Sunday! Unbelievable. Dozens of cars involved, traffic shut down for hours. There were injuries in this wreck, but everyone did survive. This is really interesting, though: We want you to take a listen to what it was like to be in the pile-up. SAM SKRAMSTAD, MOTORIST IN CAR PILE-UP: It happened too fast. It was just there and I headed for the guardrail and it didn't move. And then I just kept getting nailed. Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Ms. Smith's 7th grade class in Phoenix, Arizona! How many animals are included in the Chinese calendar? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it: A) 5, B) 7, C) 12 or D) 24? You've got three seconds -- GO! There are 12 animals associated with the Chinese calendar. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Chinese New Year . AZUZ: And we are now in the Year of the Tiger! Sunday marked the start of the Chinese New Year, and this is actually year 4708 on the Chinese calendar. And as it began, China's premier, Wen Jiabao, praised the country for working through the worldwide economic crisis, but he warned that this new year could be a complicated one. The traditional celebrations to ring in the Year of the Tiger were massive. Parades, performances, fireworks seen all over the country and in other parts of the world. Hundreds of millions of people across China traveled home for the holiday. That is why some folks believe that Chinese New Year is the world's biggest, annual human migration. Mardi Gras . AZUZ: Another big celebration taking place in New Orleans right now. It's Mardi Gras! What you're seeing here is the Bacchus parade. It's one of the many events that are part of the celebration. And the King of Bacchus, at least this year, is Saints quarterback Drew Brees! The city of New Orleans is still riding high after their recent Super Bowl win. And the crowds came out to see Brees, who was the MVP of the game, and maybe catch one of the mini-footballs he threw from the float. Mardi Gras is a French name that means Fat Tuesday. It's celebrated the day before Ash Wednesday, which is tomorrow, and that -- Ash Wednesday -- marks the start of Lent. Shoutout Extra Credit . MATT CHERRY, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for a Shoutout Extra Credit! Which of these equations represents acceleration due to gravity on Earth? You know what to do! Is it: A) a2 + b2 = c2, B) g = 9.8 m/s2, C) a = pi r2 or D) E = mc2? Rewind the clock to three seconds -- GO! Acceleration due to force of Earth's gravity is equal to 9.8 meters per second, squared. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout Extra Credit! Math and Science . AZUZ: So, can getting rid of gravity help inspire education? One company thinks so, and it's hoping students will too. Some folks are worried that the U.S. is falling behind in math and science because not enough students are interested in the subjects. They're hoping that seeing this will change that. It's a program where teachers float around in zero gravity and prove there's a fun side to math and science. Brian Todd recently went along for the ride. BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: How does it work? We're seated when the plane first starts to climb. Then, after we level off, we all have to lie on the floor of this padded cabin. We're taken on a series of so-called parabolas. The plane makes a steep climb, then practically dives for about 30 seconds. We have to lie on our backs. We're about to do the first parabola, called a partial parabola. We're going to be at about one-third of our body weight when this thing hits its peak and then starts descending. When the plane dives, we're at zero gravity. Promo . AZUZ: Cool stuff. Well, you are looking at CNNStudentNews.com, and this is where you can find every show we've done so far this school year. On the right-hand side of your page, you see where it says ""Archive"" right in the middle there under ""Shows and Transcripts""? You click that, it'll get you to our archive; you can see every show. We're also available online on iTunes. Just search ""CNN Student News."" Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we go, check out one of those typical, college bonding moments... when everyone runs at full speed at each other and then tries to nail everyone else with a ball! It's dodgeball, and what might be the world's biggest dodgeball game ever. It looks awesome. It happened at the University of Alberta in Canada. With 400 balls and more than 1,200 players, we're not sure how the organizers could really keep score of it. Goodbye . AZUZ: We guess that when anyone asked, they just dodged the question. That wraps up today's edition of CNN Student News. We will be back tomorrow and look forward to seeing you then.","Survey the largest military operation that Afghanistan has seen in years .

"London, England (CNN) -- Britain's advertising watchdog has censured an Italian ice cream manufacturer over an advertisement depicting a heavily pregnant nun that appeared ahead of a papal visit to the UK. The ad featuring the strapline ""immaculately conceived"" over an image of the expectant sister spooning from a tub of Antonio Federici ice cream was ""likely to cause widespread offense,"" the Advertising Standards Authority ruled. The ASA said the publishers of Lady magazine, which carried the ad, had received several complaints from readers. The watchdog rejected the manufacturer's claims that it was ""using gentle humor"" to convey the message that ""ice cream is our religion."" ""We considered the use of a nun pregnant through immaculate conception was likely to be seen as a distortion and mockery of the beliefs of Roman Catholics,"" the ASA ruling said. ""We concluded that to use such an image in a light hearted way to advertise ice cream was likely to cause serious offence to readers, particularly those who practised the Roman Catholic faith."" The Antonio Federici ad is the company's second invoking religious imagery to fall foul of the ASA. An advertisement featuring a nun and a priest eyeing each other for a kiss was banned in July last year. The ice cream company said the ASA's ruling amounted to censorship of artistic freedoms ahead of Pope Benedict XVI's visit to Britain this week. It said it had also been banned from showing another advertisement showing two men dressed as priests apparently on the brink of sharing a kiss. The ASA has not published any ruling on the ad. A statement from Antonio Federici said the company was seeking to relaliate by securing a series of billboard advertisements along the route the pope's motorcade is expected to take during his visit to London. ""The ASA is unable to distinguish between the 'virgin birth of Jesus Christ,' which formed the basis of their complaint notification, and the 'immaculate conception' which they are now referring to and which we have received no complaints about,"" the statement said.","Britian's advertising watchdog says ad featuring a pregnant nun could cause offense .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan acknowledged through Twitter postings Friday night that she failed a recent drug test, but the actress said she's ""working hard to overcome"" her drug addiction. Lohan's supervised probation for a 2007 drunken driving conviction requires frequent drug tests. The judge warned her last month any failure could send her back to jail. ""Regrettably, I did in fact fail my most recent drug test and if I am asked, I am prepared to appear before judge Fox next week as a result,"" Lohan tweeted Friday evening. She spent 23 days in a court-ordered drug rehab program last month, which followed a 13-day jail stint imposed when a Los Angeles judge ruled that Lohan violated her probation. Judge Elden Fox, who took over Lohan's case when she was released, imposed a new set of rules for her to follow until November. It included weekly counseling sessions for alcohol and drug rehab, random drug tests and behavioral therapy.

"Washington (CNN) -- John Boyd is a man on a mission. Beginning Thursday, the founder and head of the National Black Farmers Association can be seen driving a spluttering tractor called ""Justice"" around Capitol Hill, pressing political leaders to provide funds to settle a discrimination case involving minority farmers. Boyd, a fourth-generation black farmer himself, tells CNN that he wants Congress and the Obama administration to ""step up"" and deliver the money needed to fund the settlement. ""We've been waiting for years,"" he said. ""And when we entered into this settlement agreement back in February, the administration announced it like it was a done deal."" ""They put out in the media that they were 'turning the page' at the USDA,"" Boyd continued. ""But the bottom line is that the black farmers don't have the money."" The 1997 Pigford v. Glickman case against the U.S. Department of Agriculture claimed that black farmers were systematically denied government farm loans and support from federal programs because of the color of their skin. Eleven years ago it was settled out of court. Under a federal judge's terms dating to 1999, qualified farmers could receive $50,000 each to settle claims of racial bias. But tens of thousands of farmers missed the filing deadline to submit claims. Then-Senator Barack Obama sponsored a measure in the 2008 Farm Bill that reopened the case, known as Pigford II. And in February, the Department of Justice released a statement announcing a resolution to Pigford II. But the statement said the settlement agreement was contingent on the appropriation of funds by Congress. After that the Senate failed to approve funds already passed by the House. Boyd says the situation facing black farmers in the United States is a ""national disaster. They're dying every day, I'm going to more and more funerals every day. Black farmers are dying when they were supposed to have received this settlement years ago."" ""I decided to drive my trusty tractor here -- Justice -- all over Washington, so people can see what a real farmer looks like,"" Boyd said, adding that he wants political leaders to understand ""the lives they're affecting when they deny justice. That's what this is about. It's about a group of people who've proven their case in front of a court, who've won time and time again in Congress. Now we have a bill, a passed bill, and Congress should enact it. We already have a hundred million dollars out there. Where's that at?"" Boyd founded the non-profit National Black Farmers' Association in 1995. He's worked to represent the rights of minority farmers since the 1990s, meeting with all sorts of political figures, from lowly bureaucrats to presidents. And this isn't the first time he's mounted a somewhat unique, farm-oriented action in the U.S. capitol, either. He's driven an older tractor into Washington from his Virginia farm before. He's also driven a mule and wagon into the city as well. He chose this tactic because he says the black farmers ""are just marched out. You know they're older now, they're dying. And we're trying to get more young people involved in agriculture and farming and it's been difficult. Even my own son who really should ... hasn't expressed any interest in (farming). And deep down I know it's because he watched how damn bad I suffered with the government and how bad the government treated us, you know with getting loans and things of that nature. So I know that's really what it is. Of course he's never said that to me, but I know really what that is."" Now, Boyd says he hopes to remain in Washington until a bill is passed funding the settlement. He says he will visit the White House Friday morning to talk about what he believes the Obama administration can do to ""push this thing along."" He says he is considering making stops at the U.S. Supreme Court, along with the headquarters of both the Republican National Committee and the Democratic National Committee. Boyd says he'll put his question to leaders of all stripes: ""Why can't we get this done if we have the support they say we do amongst Republicans and Democrats and the president? Why are we still out here chasing our tail in the Senate, begging and pleading for leaders to do the right thing?"" Ultimately, however, Boyd says his protest is for everyone. ""There are other bills that are pending,"" he says. ""It's time for Congress and leaders in the Senate to start working for the American people and that includes the black farmers, too.""

"(CNN) -- Investigators have narrowed their probe into the disappearance of Oregon boy Kyron Horman and will reassign some deputies involved in the search, the local sheriff said Wednesday, but he denied the effort was being ""scaled back."" Multnomah County Sheriff Dan Staton said eight to 10 of his deputies will remain assigned to the case as part of a multi-agency task force. But with no sign of Kyron since early June, Staton said his department has to put some manpower that has been devoted to the search back onto the streets of his county, which includes Portland. ""We have taken critical hits in all of the units throughout the agency to support this investigation,"" he said. Kyron, whose eighth birthday was last week, was last seen June 4. His stepmother, Terri Horman, said she dropped him off at school on the morning of June 4. Terri Horman has been the subject of intense scrutiny for several months. In divorce filings, her ex-husband, Kaine Horman, said he believes that Terri Horman ""is involved"" in the boy's disappearance, but no arrests have been made. Staton said investigators have ruled out enough possibilities to give the probe a tighter focus with fewer people, and he disputed any characterization that the investigation was being ""scaled back"" or relegated to ""cold case"" status. Without disclosing details, Staton said the case was advancing ""in a very successful fashion"" that will allow him to return deputies to their normal duties. ""I think there will be things coming out of this investigation that will surprise you,"" he told reporters, adding, ""We have knowledge of things we wish we didn't."" But Staton said his department has spent more than $1 million on the effort so far. ""We've reached the point where if we don't go to a task-force model, this is going to critically affect the services we provide to the community,"" he said.","Sheriff wants a task force to take up Kyron Horman probe .

"(CNN)  -- World number two Novak Djokovic beat John Isner in a grueling four hour 16 minute encounter to secure Serbia's passage into the quarterfinals of the Davis Cup on Sunday. Serbia led the United States 2-1 overnight in Belgrade with Djokovic favored to beat the giant Isner to clinch the tie, but he was given an almighty scare before winning 7-5 3-6 6-3 6-7 6-4. They will now play Croatia at home on July 9-11 in the quarterfinals of the premier team event in tennis after their first-ever victory in the World Group. Djjokovic, urged on by a partisan home crowd, looked headed for a routine win as he took the opening set, but he was broken twice in the second as Isner leveled. Djokovic returned the compliment in the third set to lead two sets to one, but he could not force home the advantage and he lost a fourth set tiebreak 8-6 as Isner set up a decider. A single break in the first game gave Djokovic a crucial advantage, but his American opponent proceeded to save six match points before finally netting a forehand, the home hero sinking to his knees after an exhausting ordeal. The defeat means Patrick McEnroe's U.S. team face a relegation playoff later this year to maintain their record of playing in the World Group every year. In other ties, defending champions Spain shrugged off the absence of the injured Rafael Nadal to beat Switzerland 4-1 to set-up a quarterfinal clash with France. Russia edged out India 3-2 and will face Argentina who defeated Sweden 3-2 in Stockholm. Returning from injury David Nalbandian was Argentina's match winner in Stockholm as he beat Andreas Vinciguerra 7-5 6-3 4-6 6-4 in the deciding rubber after Swedish number one Robin Soderling had drawn them level with a straight sets win over Leonardo Mayer. 2005 champions Croatia, last year's runners-up Czech Republic and France sealed their quarterfinal places on Saturday against Ecuador, Belgium and Germany respectively. France's home clash with Spain is already whetting the appetite of tennis fans.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: One year after it became law, what is the reaction to the government's stimulus program? I'm Carl Azuz, and this is CNN Student News! First Up: Stimulus One Year Later . AZUZ: An absolute success that's created or saved millions of jobs. A massive waste that has raised the country's debt. Two opinions on the very same subject: the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Most folks just call it the stimulus plan. It was passed one year ago yesterday with a price tag of around $787 billion. That has since been re-estimated at $862 billion. The goal was to boost the country's economy by cutting taxes and through government spending. And that is exactly what President Obama says the stimulus has done. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: One year later it is largely thanks to the Recovery Act that a second Depression is no longer a possibility. It's one of the main reasons the economy has gone from shrinking by 6 percent to growing at about 6 percent. So far, the Recovery Act is responsible for the jobs of about two million Americans who would otherwise be unemployed. AZUZ: But other people disagree. In a recent CNN poll, nearly three-quarters of the people surveyed think that at least half of the stimulus money spent so far has been wasted. Earlier this week, Republican Representative John Boehner, the House minority leader, said that people, ""aren't getting their money's worth from the trillion-dollar 'stimulus,' and struggling families and small businesses are rightly asking 'Where are the jobs?'""

AZUZ: Another story we are following for you today: Toyota -- Japanese carmaker -- says it's going to hire more quality control workers, do more testing, and get an outside agency to help fix its cars' problems. The news comes in the middle of a massive recall of more than 8 million Toyota vehicles worldwide. Problems include sudden acceleration brake pedal issues, and some new complaints -- Toyota says fewer than a hundred -- involve the steering in some Corollas, Toyota's second-most popular model. Later this month, the U.S. Congress is planning hearings to ask Toyota about safety. The company says it will cooperate, and its president has repeatedly apologized. AKIO TOYODA, TOYOTA PRESIDENT [TRANSLATED]: Toyota is not perfect. But when we find a problem or are made aware of it, we act as quickly as possible. We are sincerely working on that. As VP Sasaki said, we never covered anything up or ignored any problems. I hope you understand this. TSA Swabs . AZUZ: Get your boarding pass. Check in your luggage. Put out your palms. What? That last one could be what some air travelers hear. The Transportation Security Administration is trying out a new safety check, scanning passengers' hands for traces of explosives. Experts say there's a better chance of finding these kinds of materials if you check someone's hands rather than checking baggage. The goal, of course, is to help increase airline security. The government says that part of the way it does that is by using different kinds of technology, like these hand swabs. A privacy expert says this policy shouldn't violate passengers' privacy as long as the scans are conducted randomly. Fast Facts . MATT CHERRY, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for some fast facts! Haiti and the Dominican Republic make up the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. Spain controlled the island for a time, but Haiti became a French colony in 1697. The nation gained its independence from France in 1804. Today, Haiti is home to about 9 million people, and its capital is Port-au-Prince. Haiti Update . AZUZ: France controlled Haiti for more than a century, but this week marked the first time that a French president ever visited the country. Nicolas Sarkozy, whom you see on the left here, was in Haiti yesterday. President Sarkozy met with Haitian leaders and toured some of the areas damaged by last month's earthquake. The French president was expected to announce an aid program for Haiti during his visit. This has been the scene at the airport in Port-au-Prince: planes being used to bring in relief supplies. That could change on Friday, though. American Airlines says it will start flying passenger planes into Haiti. All passenger flights were stopped after the quake hit. One company official said that offering transportation to and from the country will be a major step toward helping Haiti rebuild. Haiti Survivor Story . AZUZ: Some Haitians have already left the country; they were evacuated to hospitals in the U.S. One of them, a classical musician, had injuries that could have affected his career. But as John Zarrella tells us, a gift from an American singer will help him keep making music. (BEGIN VIDEO) JOHN ZARRELLA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: For 18 hours, Romel Joseph lay buried in the rubble of his music school in Port-au-Prince. For 18 hours until his rescue, the concert violinist stayed alert and alive going over in his head, one by one, every concerto at every concert hall he'd ever played. Romel was badly broken. His legs crushed, bones in his left hand shattered. But the concrete that covered him would not, could not kill him. ROMEL JOSEPH, VIOLINIST: I thought my time was up under the ground, and God says no, you have things to do. ZARRELLA: Three weeks ago, we met Romel, who is legally blind, for the first time. He mentioned he'd like a keyboard to help strengthen the fingers in his left hand so that some day he could again play the violin. Stevie Wonder heard and answered Romel's request. STEVIE WONDER, SINGER/SONGWRITER: What better way to really express our God's love than to give something that is special to you to someone else who is in need. So, that's why I did what I did. ZARRELLA: Wonder's keyboard was packed and shipped, arriving Tuesday at Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital. Romel didn't know it was on the way. ZARRELLA: Romel. JOSEPH: Yes, sir. ZARRELLA: Hey, John Zarrella from CNN. How are you? JOSEPH: Oh, my goodness. ZARRELLA: It's so good to see you again. You look terrific. I think we have something for you. JOSEPH: Oh, it came? ZARRELLA: It came. It's coming in the door right now. JOSEPH: Oh, my goodness. ZARRELLA: Now, who sent this to you? Stevie Wonder. JOSEPH: Oh. ZARRELLA: As the keyboard was set up, Romel was carefully moved to a wheelchair. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The chair is over here. JOSEPH: OK. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, I'm going to have you go sideways. Keep your legs on the bed. ZARRELLA: He sat over the keyboard, his legs, one held together with metal rods, resting on pillows. JOSEPH: I'll play something. ZARRELLA: He began to play. Of course, a Stevie Wonder song. Even the fingers on his damaged left hand glided across the keys with a gentle touch. Romel will be out of the hospital soon. When that happens, he'd like nothing more than to play a concert for Haiti. He on the violin and Stevie Wonder on the keyboard. JOSEPH: I mean, you know, nothing is impossible. (END VIDEO) Shoutout .

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- The Chihuahua attorney general's office said Friday it is investigating whether the car in which two photojournalists were shot Thursday in northern Mexico belonged to a human-rights activist who may have been the intended target. A photographer for El Diario newspaper in Ciudad Juarez was gunned down Thursday, the paper said on its website. A second photographer was wounded in the shooting. Luis Carlos Santiago, 21, was declared dead at the scene. He and his 18-year-old co-worker, Carlos Manuel Sanchez, were inside a silver Nissan sedan in the parking lot of a shopping mall, the newspaper said. Santiago was in the driver's seat. Unidentified gunmen followed the pair to the Rio Grande Mall, near the newspaper's offices, a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN. At 2:20 p.m., the gunmen -- who were in a compact gray car -- opened fire, killing Santiago, the newspaper said, citing witnesses. Despite having been struck in the chest and arm, Sanchez got out of the car and entered the mall, the newspaper said. The gunmen continued firing, without striking him again, then left, it reported. The wounded journalist was taken to a hospital in stable condition, the official said. The journalists were using a car that belongs to an attorney and human-rights activist, Gustavo de la Rosa, who lives in the United States, said Arturo Sandoval, a spokesman for the Chihuahua attorney general. Officials were investigating whether the elder de la Rosa was the intended target, he said. De la Rosa's son, an editor at the newspaper, had loaned the car to the two photojournalists to use to drive to the mall, where they were planning to attend a photography class taught by a newspaper staff member, El Diario reported. Ciudad Juarez is one of the deadliest cities in Mexico, with 2,185 killings since January 1 and the country is one of the most dangerous for journalists. Much of the violence stems from turf wars between rival cartels and battles between the cartels and the Mexican authorities. The source said it was not clear whether Thursday's killing was related to drug violence. The gunmen used 9mm handguns, the official said. The newspaper reported Friday that witnesses cited at least two gunmen. Santiago is the ninth journalist killed in Mexico this year, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Drug cartels pressure journalists and editors in Mexico to avoid reporting on them and to print unflattering stories about rival drug cartels. The result has been increasing self-censorship from many media outlets throughout the country. Press freedom organizations say Mexico does not do enough to investigate the killing of journalists. A recent CPJ report found ""systemic failures that, if left unaddressed, will further erode freedom of expression and the rule of law. Vital national and international interests are at stake."" CNN's Nick Valencia contributed to this story.","1 journalist killed, 1 wounded in Juarez .

"(CNN) -- Pakistan took big steps towards leveling the two-Test cricket series against Australia after bowling out their opponents for just 88 runs in Britain on Wednesday. The Australians, who won the first match by 150 runs, failed to reach three figures in an innings for the first time since 1984 as captain Ricky Ponting paid for his decision to bat first in bowler-friendly conditions after winning the toss. Pakistan, led by new captain Salman Butt after Shahid Afridi ended his brief return to the Test arena following that defeat at Lord's, then reached 148-3 before rain cut short the opening day in Leeds. Teenage paceman Mohammad Aamer and fellow opening bowler Mohammad Asif took three wickets each as Australia crashed to the nation's lowest first-innings score since 1956 -- when dismissed for 80, also by Pakistan. ""There was moisture under the wicket so I think it was a shocking decision, especially for Australia,"" Pakistan bowler Umar Gul told reporters. ""I don't know what the captain and coach's decision was going to be but if we won the toss we were ready to bowl first. This morning it was swinging a lot and the ball was seaming."" Tim Paine's leading knock of 17 was Australia's fourth-lowest in a Test innings in which all 11 players have batted. The No. 7 was last man out in a fighting 47-ball stay, scoring one more run than all-rounder Marcus North. Gul also claimed two wickets while Umar Amin dismissed North and was also involved in the run-out of tailender Ben Hilfenhaus. The Pakistanis went into a 13-match losing run against Australia that goes back to 1995, but struck an early blow when the 18-year-old Aamer trapped opener Simon Katich leg before wicket for 13. Afridi quits Tests after 150-run defeat at Lord's . That opened the floodgates as Asif sent Shane Watson (5) and Ponting (6) back to the pavilion at Headingley in similar fashion, and Gul bowled Michael Clarke (3). From 29-4, Australia slumped further to 73-6 at lunch as Mike Hussey (5) also went lbw to Gul and North was caught behind off the medium pace of Amin. Aamer then took wickets with the first two balls of the middle session, bowling Steven Smith and Mitchell Johnson, but Hilfenhaus avoided becoming the hat-trick victim. Australia's bowlers could not extract the same amount of swing from the overcast conditions, and Butt put on 80 for the first wicket with Imran Farhat before being bowled by Hilfenhaus. Farhat also fell short of a half-century as he was trapped lbw by Watson for 45 with the score at 133, and the all-rounder then dispatched Azar Ali (30) seven runs later. Amin (1) and Umar Akmal (8) were unbeaten when bad light and then rain ended a day on which 13 wickets fell for just 236 runs. The series is being played in England due to security issues in Pakistan.","Australia collapse to 88 all out on opening day of second Test against Pakistan in Leeds .

"(CNN) -- Veteran American Paul Goydos has become just the fourth player in PGA Tour history to break the 60-shot barrier after carding a remarkable 12-under-par 59 in the opening round of the John Deere Classic on Thursday. Goydos follows in the footsteps of Al Geiberger (1977), Chip Beck (1991) and David Duval (1999) after his 12-birdie blitz at the TPC Deer Run, Silvis, Illinois. However, Goydos, who at 46 is the oldest player to achieve the feat, is the only one of the quartet to break the barrier on a par-71. The Californian closed out the back nine in just 28 shots, with eight birdies in nine holes, while he took just 22 putts all day. Michael Letzig and Australian Matt Jones head the chasing pack after carding seven-under-par 64s, with Letzig also keeping a bogey off his card. Japan's Ryo Ishikawa is the only player to shoot a round of 68, which he achieved in the final round of The Crowns on his home tour on May 2. Meanwhile, Irishman Darren Clarke leads the field after the opening round of the Scottish Open at Loch Lomond. The former Ryder Cup player carded a six-under-par 65 to hold a narrow advantage over Graeme Storm, Damien McGrane and Edoardo Molinari in the traditional British Open warm-up. The 40-year-old Clarke has still not secured a place in the St Andrews field next week and he told reporters: ""This is the first round and there's an awful long way to go, but of course I would love to qualify."" A further seven players, including American John Daly, are a further stroke behind, while world number two Phil Mickelson is off the pace after an opening round level par 71.","Veteran American Paul Goydos cards a 12-under-par 59 in the John Deere Classic .

"(CNN)  -- 2005 champions Croatia take on neighbors and arch-rivals Serbia in the Davis Cup quarterfinals this weekend -- their first tennis clash since becoming independent nations following the break-up of the old Yugoslavia. The tie in Split gives Croatia home advantage, but in terms of world rankings Serbia, headed by Novak Djokovic, will start as narrow favorites to reach the last four. What is guaranteed is a tinderbox atmosphere in a Spaladium Arena filled to the brim with about 1,000 Serbian fans in the 10,000 capacity crowd. Mindful of recent incidents at the Australian Open where Serb and Croat fans have been involved in ugly scuffles, extra security measures have been laid on by local police. Yugoslavia reached the Davis Cup semifinals three times, the last being in 1991, the year Croatia declared independence, leading to a bloody Balkan war with the Serbs. Fortunately, relations have improved at all levels between the countries and Djokovic told CNN's Open Court earlier this year that players in the Croatian team were among his best friends on the circuit. ""I mostly get along with tennis players from my country, from Serbia, Tipsarevic, and from Croatia, Ljubicic, Ancic and Cilic, all these guys that I speak the same language with, it gets easier to have a friendship with and have a good connection,"" he revealed. That friendship will be put aside when action in the best-of-five tie gets underway on Friday with the opening singles rubbers. Croatia have been hit by injuries to Mario Ancic and big-serving Ivo Karlovic, with Ivan Ljubicic coming out of Davis Cup retirement especially for this tie. With the reshuffles, a heavy weight of expectation falls on the shoulders of Croatian number one, 21-year-old Marin Cilic, who said the tie was going to be a ""memory for life."" ""It's going to be a clash of two great nations,"" he told the official Davis Cup  website. ""There's going to be a lot of tension in the air but hopefully everything is going to go all right."" Cilic, who lost in the first round at Wimbledon, like Ljubicic is at his best on the indoor hard court surface being used in Split. They will need to be with Djokovic, newly installed as world number two, leading a Serbian team boasting Viktor Troicki, Janko Tipsarevic and doubles world number one Nenad Zimonjic. Djokovic is confident of victory but also wary of Croatia's home advantage. ""Given the quality of our team, it is logical to expect victory,"" he told his official website. ""Of course, it is hard to predict what will happen there, because being a host in Davis Cup matches is an advantage. Djokovic wants top spot in rankings . ""But, as I said, we have quality, which we've been confirming years back and we can challenge any team on any surface in any country. I am optimistic,"" he added. Serbia knocked out the United States 3-2 in their last 16 World Group tie to reach the quarterfinals for the first time but Djokovic wants them to go all the way. ""We have a good chance to pass the Croats, and I think we can go all the way to the finals,"" he concluded. Djokovic opens against Ljubicic in the first singles match Friday, with Cilic then playing Troicki. In Saturday's key doubles clash, Croats Ivan Dodik and Antonio Veic are up against Tipsarevic and Zimonjic. In other ties, defending champions Spain will be without world number one and Wimbledon champion Rafael Nadal as they take on France at Clermont- Ferrand. Spain are bidding for a hat-trick of titles while France are hampered by the loss through injury of their top-ranked player Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. Another absentee this week is Wimbledon finalist Tomas Berdych who misses the Czech Republic's visit to Chile in Coquimbo. Russia have Nikolay Davydenko back for their Moscow tie against Argentina, who are missing injured U.S. Open champ Juan Martin del Potro.","Croatia take on Serbia in Davis Cup quarterfinal tie in Split .

"(CNN) -- Andy Roddick cruised to victory in the Sony Ericsson Open on Sunday with a straight sets triumph over Tomas Berdych in the final in Miami. The sixth-seeded American -- who had not won a Masters title on the ATP Tour for four years -- fired 13 ace and did not face a single set point in a 7-5 6-4 win.

I won my first ever match here and it's nice to see it come full circle and I couldn't be happier,"" said 27-year-old Roddick in his courtside interview. ""Tomas had a great tournament and is always a guy you don't want to see in your part of the draw."" Berdych added: ""Andy was really too strong so I would like to congratulate him.

"(CNN) -- Paula Creamer defied the odds to win her first major trophy at the 65th U.S. Women's Open on Sunday after recovering from a career-threatening thumb injury. The 23-year-old American thought she would never play golf again after aggravating her injured left thumb while playing in the season-ending LPGA Championship in Houston last year. The win at Oakmont Country Club is even more impressive given that Creamer had surgery as recently as March and had to play through the pain in her thumb during the final day, when she played 23 holes due to earlier rain delays. ""You don't have surgery on your thumb and win a championship,"" she told reporters, quoted on the U.S.G.A. website. ""I don't think the odds are very good after that. ""I had my surgery, and yes, there was a time before my surgery where I thought, 'Oh, my gosh, I may never play golf again' or, you know, if the surgery goes wrong. ""But it was what I had to do, and here we are with a U.S. Open championship next to me. So it's been pretty cool."" Creamer, who had previously won eight LPGA Tour titles, went into her fourth tournament since the surgery far from 100 percent fit. The Californian, who is limited to hitting mostly shots off a tee in practice, said her win shows how important the mental side is to the sport. ""I don't even think I'm 80 percent [fit],"" she said. ""Jeez, I've said this whole time I think I'm about 60. ""It just shows, you know, how much the mental side of golf can really take over. You know, I believed I could do this. I believed I could do this when I had a cast on my hand. ""That's what I just kept thinking about was Oakmont, Oakmont, Oakmont."" Creamer, nicknamed the ""Pink Panther"" because of her fondness for wearing the color, beat joint second-placed Na Yeon Choi of South Korea (66) and Norway's Suzanne Pettersen (69) by four strokes. She completed her rain-delayed third round of 70 before carding a closing 69, at three-under for the tournament making her the only player to break par. She was in tears after watching her final putt sink in the hole to end years of questions from the media as to whether the former teenage amateur star would ever win a major tournament. Creamer became the first American to win the U.S. Open since Cristie Kerr in 2007 and the second after Meg Mallon's 2004 triumph. ""It's incredible, it really is,"" Creamer said. ""It's been amazing. ""I've always thought of my career as I've always been a pretty solid player, but yes, that question always lurked: How come you never won a major? ""And now we have, and we never get to get asked that question again!""","Paula Creamer battled through the pain to win the 65th U.S. Women's Open .

"London, England (CNN) -- A survivor of the fatal Gaza flotilla incident in May headed out Saturday on a new convoy to bring medical supplies to the Palestinian territory. Kevin Ovenden departed London on Saturday morning with about a dozen vans and more than 30 international volunteers as part of the Viva Palestina Lifeline 5 convoy. Two other convoys were being organized at the same time from Casablanca, Morocco, and Doha, Qatar, his group said. The three convoys will aim to meet in Syria before traveling together to Gaza, organizers said. ""Our mission last time was to take aid in and to highlight the siege,"" Ovenden told CNN. ""That's our mission this time."" Nine Turkish activists died May 31 when Israeli troops boarded the Mavi Marmara, a flotilla of activists heading to Gaza. Israel has maintained its troops used force on the activists after they were attacked by those onboard, but passengers on the boat insisted they were fired on without provocation. ""I witnessed the man one meter in front of me being shot in the leg, a man 50 centimeters to the back right of me being shot through the abdomen,"" Ovenden said of the experience. ""Neither of them had anything in their hands. There was no Israeli commandos within the immediate proximity. They were shot from above, so it was simply unfeasible -- in that incident I saw -- for anyone to claim they were in fear of their lives when they rang out those shots."" The incident drew international outrage and badly shook a wide-ranging military and diplomatic alliance between the Jewish state and Turkey, its powerful regional ally. Israel maintains it must inspect all goods entering Gaza so that weapons do not get into the hands of militants. Gaza is run by Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist movement that has said it is dedicated to the destruction of Israel. Unlike the flotilla in May, the convoy aims to enter Gaza by land, through the Rafa border crossing with Egypt, Ovenden said. When the three convoys meet in Syria, they plan to be shipped past the point at which the Mavi Marmara was attacked and down to the Egyptian port of Al Arish before going to Rafah, he said. Organizers said it is the largest convoy set to break the Gaza embargo. CNN's Eileen Hsieh contributed to this report.","The convoy includes two survivors of the flotilla incident in May .

"(CNN) -- Virender Sehwag was the star with bat and ball as he offered India a glimmer of hope as they bid to win the third Test and level the series against Sri Lanka. The batsman completed his 21st Test century soon after the start of play on Thursday morning after India resumed on 180-2 in reply to Sri Lanka's first innings total of 425. And after half centuries from VVS Laxman and Suresh Raina had helped India to 436 all out, Sehwag took two wickets to reduce Sri Lanka to 45-2 at the close and heap pressure on their middle order. Sehwag quickly passed the hundred mark in the first session but fell soon after for 109, caught by Chanaka Welegedara off the bowling Suraj Randiv. Sachin Tendulkar made 41 before he was caught behind by wicketkeeper Mahela Jayawardene off the bowling of Lasitha Malinga. Laxman then added 56 and Raina made 62 before they were both removed by Ajantha Mendis. Abhimanyu Mithun and Amit Mishra both added valuable runs to see India past Sri Lanka's total before Randiv removed both players to bring an end to the innings. Sri Lanka were unable to negotiate the final session without losing a wicket as both opening batsman fell to Sehwag. Tharanga Paranavitana was caught behind by captain MS Dhoni before Sehwag snagged Tillakaratne Dilshan thanks to a catch from Murali Vijay. Sri Lanka will resume on day four just 34 runs ahead of their rivals, with eight wickets remaining. They lead 1-0 in the three match series.","Sri Lanka reduced to 45-2 in their second innings against India .

"(CNN) -- Of the 14 ""Bachelors"" and five ""Bachelorettes"" who've handed out roses to prospective life partners on ABC's hit reality show, only four couples are still together and only two have actually gotten married. So how does a reality dating show with a 9.5 percent success rate reel in about 8 million viewers week after week? ""It's the fairytale aspect,"" said Sarah Polonsky, the entertainment editor at BettyConfidential.com, a site covering pop culture and relationships. ""What man or woman wouldn't want all these guys vying for our love? ... It speaks to the part of us that wants to be the bad girl or the bad boy. The part of us that wants what isn't good for us."" It's definitely about the fairytale for viewer Gilmar Gomes, 55, who says the show ""is like a fantasy."" Gomes said he doesn't mind being heckled by his friends for watching the show, which he first came across last season while flipping through channels. He said it gives him hope that true love is out there somewhere. ""It has all the ingredients,"" he added. ""Beautiful places, beautiful people. ... I remember when [Jake Pavelka and Vienna Girardi] were on a date in California. That seemed like the right place to fall in love."" However odd it may seem, some folks believe the show's failed couplings have been a key ingredient in the show's continued success. According to Polonsky, ""We just love it because we feel so much better about our own lives."" ""It's been a tough few years -- a lot of people have lost their jobs and their money. We all wish we could fall in love in Iceland and Italy and Hawaii, but if we can't, why not watch it [on TV]."" Steve Carbone, who has recapped ""The Bachelor"" and ""The Bachelorette"" since their infancy on his spoiler site RealitySteve.com, agrees. ""It's never really been about the ending,"" he said. ""People are more just invested in the dates and the journey and cattiness in the house -- that's what people tune in for. They like the drama."" And ABC is well-aware of that, which is why not all of Ali's 25 hand-picked suitors this season appear to be a perfect match for this single girl. In order to produce such a show, ABC casts characters they know will deliver, Carbone added. ""They're not actually looking for the 25 best matches for Ali. ... They know what they're doing -- they're producing great dramatic TV."" Janet Matuscak Gamin is one of thousands of viewers who turns to Facebook Tuesday through Sunday to fill her ""Bachelorette"" void. Matuscak Gamin, who started watching the reality series last season when contestant Rozlyn Papa was sent home for allegedly having a relationship with one of the show's producers, says she watches ""The Bachelorette"" not as a dating show but as a comedy. ""I laugh at it all night long because I can't believe the things people say and the things they do,"" Matuscak Gamin said. Carbone adds that it's important not to confuse the character ABC wants you to see with the real person. ""Anybody that says they want to date somebody from the show. ...

"(CNN) -- Former world number one Jelena Jankovic won her first tournament since last August with a straight sets 6-2 6-4 victory over Caroline Wozniacki in the final of the WTA tournament at Indian Wells. Serbian ace Jankovic has flourished in the Californian desert and dominated Sunday's final to claim a 6-2 6-4 victory, her 12th career title. ""It's been a great two weeks for me, really amazing,"" Jankovic told the official WTA Tour Web site. ""I'm so happy and so thrilled that I was able to win this title.""

Wozniacki had guaranteed she will attain second spot in the world behind Serena Williams in the new rankings with her semifinal victory over Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland. But she was unable to maintain that form against Jankovic, who had beaten her on four previous occasions. Jankovic, who last won a title in Cincinatti, survived some early round scares to ease past Samantha Stosur in the semifinals of the Premier tier event. She had Wozniacki in trouble early, achieving a double break to lead 4-0 before being broken on her own serve as the Dane cut the lead to 4-2. But Jankovic, who topped the rankings back in 2008, broke back immediately and claimed the set on her own service as Wozniacki went long with a forehand. The second set followed a similar pattern with Jankovic gaining an early break before holding her own service throughout. At 5-4, she set up a match point with a backhand winner and sealed it when Wozniacki went long with a service return.","Jelena Jankovic beats Caroline Wozniacki to win WTA title at Indian Wells .

"(CNN) -- Venus and Serena Williams' bid for a fifth consecutive Grand Slam doubles title ended when they were beaten in the Wimbledon quarterfinals. The defending champions were beaten 3-6 6-3 6-4 by Russian pair Elena Vesnina and Vera Zvonareva -- their first defeat at the championships since 2003. Zvonareva could potentially meet Serena in the single's final if both win their semifinals on Thursday. The Russian plays Tsvetana Pironkova, from Bulgaria, who beat Venus on Tuesday. Serena is due to play unseeded Czech Petra Kvitova. The Williams' sisters raced through the opening set but were pegged back by their Russian opponents in the second.

"(CNN) -- Defending champion Martin Kaymer will take a one-shot lead into the final round of the French Open after Alejandro Canizares suffered a nightmare finish to Saturday's rain-delayed third round. Spanish golfer Canizares, the halfway leader, was three clear going into the final three holes at Le Golf National in Paris, but twice found the water hazards. A bogey at the par-three 16th and another at the par-four 18th saw him finish the day tied for second with England's Steve Webster on eight-under-par 205 after carding a two-over 73. Kaymer made two birdies and two bogeys on his front nine after the morning's play was washed out by rain, and then came home in nine pars for a level 71. ""You want to play well to get into the lead and I didn't play well, to be honest,"" the German told the European Tour website. ""I hit a lot of bad iron shots, but I kept it together. This is one of the biggest tournaments we have on the European Tour. To win it once is a big once, but to win it twice would be awesome."" Canizares needs to win the tournament to qualify for this month's British Open and appear at his first major event. Webster played at the 1995 British Open, when he was top amateur ahead of Tiger Woods.

"(The Frisky) -- Back in 2007, ""Bachelor"" viewers were shocked when lame-oid Brad Womack decided not to choose either of the final 2 contestants (Jenni Croft or DeAnna Pappas) in the show's last episode. Uh, didn't he get that memo about the point of the show? DeAnna was totally heartbroken, but picked herself up and became ""The Bachelorette."" Only she and her final choice -- Jesse Csincsak -- didn't work out, either. Now, DeAnna has found her new love. And oddly enough, it happened because of ""The Bachelor."" One of DeAnna's good friends is Holly Durst, a contestant on ""The Bachelor"" who was let go by Matt Grant. (Bizarre side note: she also dated Jesse.) Holly later got together with Michael Stagliano, who tried to win over Jillian Harris on ""The Bachelorette."" Holly and Michael decide to set up DeAnna with Michael's twin, Stephen, and -- shocker -- it worked. DeAnna is currently home in Georgia, planning her wedding to Stephen, which will apparently be going down very soon. According to RadarOnline, before she left for the trip, Stephen tweeted, ""The love of my life leaves me today to go home to Georgia :( ."" There's something oddly inspiring about seeing someone who was crushed on ""The Bachelor"" find love in real life.

Really, really bad. But Melissa leaned on a close friend and ex, Tye Strickland, after it all went down. Six months later they were engaged and they tied the knot last December, having their first kiss as a married couple to an instrumental version of the ""Monday Night Football"" theme song. She told Us Weekly, ""We've been really good friends, but the timing was never right,"" she said. ""It's funny how things happen.

""We probably never would have met if it wasn't for the show. He's actually from Indiana, and I've never even been to Indiana, and he's now in Connecticut, and I had never been to Connecticut,"" Tara said. John is pumped, too.

"(CNN)  -- Top seed and defending champion Serena Williams charged into her sixth Wimbledon final where she will play Russian Vera Zvonareva on Saturday. Williams ended the dreams of unseeded Czech Petra Kvitova with a 7-6 6-2 victory in their semifinal on Centre Court on Friday. Earlier, Zvonareva came from a set down to beat another unseeded player, Bulgarian Tsvetana Pironkova, 3-6 6-3 6-2. Williams was extended by Kvitova in a near hour-long first set, which saw both exchange breaks before going into a tiebreak. The world number one raced into a 4-0 lead before Kvitova fought back and it needed a strong service winner from Williams to close it out 7-5. Williams broke the left-hander in the fifth game of the second set and extended her advantage in the penultimate game. But that was not before Kvitova had won the rally of the match, a 19-stroke thriller, to save a break point. But Williams eventually took the game to go up a double break and served out for the match. Only Zvonareva stands between her and a fourth Wimbledon title to add to her victory in the Australian Open earlier this year. But the tournament favorite is still wary of the challenge of her talented opponent. ""I've had some unbelievable matches against her, she's really tough,"" she told BBC Sport. The 25-year-old Zvonareva reached her first grand slam final after seeing off Pirinkova, who beat Venus Williams in the quarterfinals. ""I haven't quite realized what I've done yet,"" Zvonareva told AFP. ""It is very exciting. It's one of my dreams to be in the final."" The turning point of their match came in the sixth game of the second set as Zvonareva made the breakthrough on Pirinkova's service and went on to level at a set all. A break in the very first game of the decider put Zvonoreva on top and she broke again as Pirinkova missed a forehand.

Metzelder, who spent some time at Schalke as a junior, made his name at the Blues' bitter rivals Borussia Dormund -- winning the Bundesliga title in 2002 and featuring in the Germany side that lost to Brazil in that year's World Cup final.

"(CNN) -- Six-time champion Roger Federer has failed to make the title match at Wimbledon for the first time since 2002 after being dumped out in the quarterfinals on Wednesday. Federer's title defense came crashing to a halt in the face of an inspired performance from Tomas Berdych in London. The Swiss star was knocked out at the last-eight stage of a tennis grand slam event for second successive time following his similar exit at the French Open a month ago. Czech 12th seed Berdych triumphed 6-4 3-6 6-1 6-4 in front of a stunned crowd on Centre Court to set up a semifinal clash with No. 3 Novak Djokovic. Federer, the top seed ahead of world No. 1 Rafael Nadal -- who reached the semis by beating sixth seed Robin Soderling -- later revealed that he had been hampered by injuries. ""I am struggling with a little bit of a back and a leg issue. That just doesn't quite allow me to play the way I would like to play. So it's frustrating, to say the least,"" the 28-year-old star told reporters, as quoted by AFP. Baseline bard: Wimbledon serves up poetry ace . ""The leg injury came in the finals of Halle. That never really went away, and the back's been feeling really badly stiff for the last five or six days. When you're hurting, it's just a combination of many things. You just don't feel as comfortable. ""Under the circumstances, I think I played a decent match. But I've been feeling bad for the last two, three matches now. It's just not good and healthy to play under these kind of conditions. So if there's anything good about this, it's that I'm going to get some rest, that's for sure."" Federer was sluggish throughout the match, and though Berdych wobbled in the final games, he held his nerve to record the biggest victory of his career to date. Berdych broke Federer's serve in the seventh game of the opening set to take it 6-4, but the world number two looked to have regained control as he powered to a 6-3 triumph in the second. Wimbledon's humble beginnings . But Federer's game fell apart in the third set as Berdych took it 6-1 in just 27 minutes. Another vital break in the fourth set took Berdych to the brink of victory, and he took his second match point to seal an impressive win. It was only Federer's sixth defeat on Centre Court, but the former champion was still afforded a huge ovation as he waved to the crowd upon leaving the arena. Berdych reached his second grand slam semifinal, having also reached the last four in Paris earlier this month before losing to eventual runner-up Soderling. ""It's amazing to play in this stadium against such a great player and to leave as the winner is an amazing feeling,"" he told the BBC. ""So far it was the toughest game in my career to serve to close out the match."" Earlier, Djokovic brushed aside the challenge of Yen-Hsun Lu to clinch a place in the last four. John Isner on his marathon match at Wimbledon . The Serbian had little trouble dispatching Lu, from Taiwan, 6-3 6-2 6-2 in just one hour and 51 minutes on Court No. 1. Djokovic's unseeded opponent, who beat American Andy Roddick in the previous round, didn't force a single break point in the entire match. Djokovic told the BBC: ""Nothing is easy these days especially at this stage of the tournament but the way I played I deserved to win. I hit all the shots, played the rallies and was solid from all parts of the court and I am very happy. ""I sincerely hope I can continue with this level of my game but you never know how you are going to wake up in two days but the way I am playing match after match is very encouraging. ""You have nothing to lose in the semifinals and definitely this time I am physically fitter than in my last one three years ago."" Nadal, who beat Federer in the final in 2008 but missed out on last year's event due to knee problems, was again too strong for Soderling as he followed up his Roland Garros triumph with another win over the Swede. The Spaniard came from behind to win 3-6 6-3 7-6 (7-4) 6-1. He will now face Andy Murray after the British fourth seed beat French No. 10 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-7 7-6 6-2 6-2. Murray dropped the opening set on a tie-break but took the second by the same method. After that, Tsonga capitulated and Murray wrapped up the third and fourth sets with the minimum of fuss. Speaking of his clash with Nadal Murray told the BBC: ""It will be a great match, it's always fun. I think we've played four times in Grand Slams and won two each. I'm looking forward to it.""","Tomas Berdych knocks top seed Roger Federer out of Wimbledon in the quarterfinals .

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich were left tantalizingly close to a 22nd German Bundesliga title after closest rivals Schalke suffered a 2-0 defeat at home to third-placed Werder Bremen in the penultimate round of the league season on Saturday. Leaders Bayern beat second-bottom Bochum 3-1 to move three points clear of Schalke, and now have a 17-goal better for-and-against differential ahead of the final match against relegated Hertha Berlin. Felix Magath's Schalke side travel to Mainz next Saturday knowing they cannot be overtaken in second place by Bremen, who hold the third and final Champions League place for next season by a margin of two points from Bayer Leverkusen. Bayern, who last won the title in 2008 and played in a new retro strip in front of 69,000 home fans, romped to victory thanks to a hat-trick from young midfielder Thomas Mueller, who also hit the post. The 20-year-old Germany international opened the scoring in the 18th minute with his 11th goal this season, netted his second two minutes after and sealed victory on 69 to all-but guarantee Louis Van Gaal's team a first of three possible trophies this season. The Bavarians qualified for the Champions League final in midweek, and can also claim the German Cup if they beat Schalke in the title match. Van Gaal was in celebratory mood as he looked forward to officially sealing his first trophy in his first season at Bayern. ""We've hit our most important target, winning the Bundesliga,"" the Dutchman told the club's Web site. ""The first 20-25 minutes today were outstanding. It was the best we've played at the Allianz Arena this season. Then it was just a case of waiting to see what Schalke did. ""This trophy means a lot to me. There aren't many coaches in Europe who've been fortunate enough to win the league in three countries. I'm very proud of that. We want to win more trophies now. Bayern is the best club I've ever worked for."" Bochum, for whom Christian Fuchs scored a consolation 85th-minute free-kick, face relegation unless they can beat Hannover next weekend. Magath had been seeking to follow up last season's title success while in charge of Wolfsburg, but Schalke's hopes ended with defeat against Werder Bremen. The hosts went close to a vital opening goal when top scorer Kevin Kuranyi headed against the bar in the 22nd minute, but it was former Schalke midfielder Mesut Ozil who netted first with a fine solo effort 10 minutes after halftime. Ozil further silenced the home fans nine minutes later when he set up Portuguese striker Hugo Almeida for the second goal from close range. Bayer Leverkusen's hopes of playing in the Champions League suffered a big blow with a 1-1 draw that condemned Hertha Berlin to the second division. Hertha took the lead through Rafael after just 12 minutes, but Manuel Friedrich equalized for the home side in the 59th minute to leave Leverkusen -- who seemed title contenders for the first half of the season -- just a point above Borussia Dortmund. Dortmund were also held 1-1 at home, by eighth-placed Wolfsburg, as Marco Stiepermann canceled out Edin Dzeko's 69th-minute goal for the visitors. Sixth-placed Stuttgart failed to take advantage of Dortmund's slip, drawing 2-2 at home to Mainz to be three points adrift in the race for the second Europa League berth. Stuttgart, who were in relegation trouble when Christian Gross took over as manager in December, needed two second-half goals from Romanian striker Ciprian Marica to earn a point. Hannover moved out of the relegation zone with a surprise 6-1 hammering of 13th-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach, while Nuremburg dropped into the bottom three after a 4-0 defeat at Hamburg. Freiburg guaranteed another season in the Bundesliga with a 2-2 draw at Cologne, who moved above Gladbach on goal difference.

"(CNN) -- Formula One is set for a return to the United States in 2012, after an agreement was reached to build a brand-new racing track in the Texan state capital Austin. The decision for the southern American city to host F1 on a ten-year deal was confirmed on Wednesday, by the sport's rights owner Bernie Ecclestone. ""For the first time in the history of Formula One in the United States, a world-class facility will be purpose-built to host the event,"" he told the official F1 Web site. ""This will be the first time a facility is constructed from the ground up specifically for Formula One in the US."" Is America interested in Formula One? The U.S. Grand Prix was last held at the famous Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 2007 and America has hosted F1 Grand Prix's in a number of locations across the country since the 1950's. However, the U.S.'s relationship with the sport ended amidst controversy when a dispute between tire manufacturers in 2005 led to most drivers boycotting the race and only six competing. But speculation has been rife over F1 returning to the country for some time, after Ecclestone made no secret that he wished to make a fresh attempt to crack the U.S. market. New York, San Francisco and Miami were some of the other locations in the frame to host a revamped U.S. Grand Prix, but it was the surprise contender Austin that won the race in the end. And organizers in Austin are confident that after its five-year break F1 can become more popular in the U.S. that it was last time around. ""We realize that over the last 30 years there have been one or two missing pieces from the previous editions of the United States Grand Prix,"" Tavo Hellmand, managing director of US Grand Prix promoters Full Throttle Productions told the F1 Web site. ""We have a tremendous opportunity at hand to do it right - to feature Austin as the backdrop and produce one of the great sporting events in the world."" The American company Goodyear is also competing to provide the tires for the next F1 season -- along with Italian tire firm Pirelli and French firm Michelin -- which could further increase American influence in the sport. There is also the prospect of the all-American team USF1 taking part in future F1 racing -- the team failed to line up on the grid for the 2010 Championships due to financial troubles, but the sport's governing body, the Federation Internationale d' Automobile, are considering the possibility of the team taking part in the 2011 season.","Formula One to return to U.S. at a new track in Austin, Texas .

"(CNN) -- English Premier League side Aston Villa have confirmed that Martin O'Neill has resigned as manager of the club. The Northern Irishman led Villa to sixth place in the league for the past three seasons but has decided to walk out of the club just five days before the start of the new season. O'Neill took over at Villa Park in August 2006 and was afforded millions to spend in the transfer market by the club's American owner Randy Lerner. But a year ago midfielder Gareth Barry was sold to Manchester City, and England international James Milner is reportedly on the verge of following Barry to Eastlands. There was speculation that O'Neill was only persuaded to stay at the end of last season after talks with Lerner but now his departure has been confirmed. A statement on the club's official website read: ""Aston Villa can confirm that Martin O'Neill has resigned as manager of the football club with immediate effect. ""Kevin MacDonald, reserve team manager, has assumed the role of caretaker manager and will prepare the team for the opening Barclays Premier League game of the season against West Ham on Saturday at Villa Park."" O'Neill said: ""I have enjoyed my time at Aston Villa immensely. It's obviously a wrench to be leaving such a magnificent club. ""I would like to pay tribute to the Villa players, my coaching staff and the Villa supporters for all the support and encouragement they have given both the club and me personally during my time as manager. ""I wish them all the best for the future. I will obviously be assisting the club in the immediate short-term with regard to the handover of my duties."" O'Neill transformed Villa into genuine contenders to finish in the top four and qualify for the European Champions League but he couldn't secure the club's first trophy since 1996. Villa lost 2-1 to Manchester United in last season's Carling Cup final and were beaten in the FA Cup semifinal by eventual winners Chelsea. Before Villa, O'Neill had successful spells with English clubs Wycombe Wanderers and Leicester City, as well as Scottish giants Celtic. He can boast eight major trophies and three promotions in his 20-year long managerial career. Paul Faulkner, chief executive of Aston Villa, added: ""The club would like to thank Martin for the great work he has done at Aston Villa over the past four years. ""He has helped to establish the club in the upper echelons of the Premier League, has taken us to Wembley and we have also qualified for European competition for the past three seasons under his management.

"(CNN) -- U.S. golfer Stewart Cink has promised a ""fiercely competitive"" defense of his British Open title at St Andrews next week. Cink, the world number 34, was a surprise winner of the Claret Jug last season, beating veteran Tom Watson in a play-off to land his first major title. The British Open will celebrate its 150th anniversary at the sport's spiritual home in Scotland when the event gets underway on Thursday, July 15. ""St. Andrews will be special,"" Cink told CNN's Living Golf. ""Obviously it will be my third Open that I've played there. I just have so much respect for it, the way it has developed over the years and it's [...] amazing that it's remained this good for this long. ""It will also be a time to be fiercely competitive because I really don't want to give that up again."" A year ago at Turnberry, Cink finished level with five-time champion Watson on two under par, before storming to a six-shot victory in the four-hole play-off. Ranked 33 at the time and with only one previous top-10 finish at the championship, Cink says he was inspired by fellow American Lucas Glover, who shocked better-known rivals to land the U.S. Open title last year. ""I looked back and thought, well, if Lucas Glover can win the U.S. Open then why can't I win a major? What's stopping me? ""At the end of a major championship, there's always one guy that just seems to have the poise to come and step through the threshold -- that was me that Sunday. It was humbling and satisfying."" Cink will playing at a St Andrews Open for the third time and thinks he knows the secret to success on the Old Course. ""You need to avoid the bunkers, that's the main thing"" he said. ""It's probably got the most severe set of bunkers of any Open venue. You really have to position your second shots."" While Watson will be making another bid for his sixth title at St Andrews, another of the sport's legends won't be there. Australia's Greg Norman, the 1986 and 1993 winner, has pulled out of the tournament because of a shoulder injury. The 53-year-old, who finished joint third at Royal Birkdale in the 2008 Open, has not played an event since undergoing shoulder surgery in September. ""I'm disappointed that I will not be able to participate in this year's Open Championship, but unfortunately, it is taking me longer than expected to regain my competitive form,"" Norman told the Open's official website.

"(CNN) -- Arsene Wenger has admitted he rejected several offers from other clubs before committing his future to Arsenal. The French coach signed a three-year contract extension before his team opened their English Premier League season with a 1-1 draw at Liverpool on Sunday. Wenger's contract had been due to expire at the end of this season but now his stay at Arsenal will be extended to 18 years if he sees out the new deal. In that time the 60-year-old has become Arsenal's most successful manager of all time, winning the league title three times and the FA Cup four times. But Wenger's last trophy came back in 2005, with many Arsenal fans restless at their lack of silverware since. ""I love the club and I don't see myself going anywhere else,'' Wenger told reporters after the game at Anfield. ""I believe I have one way only to show my commitment to this club - by signing a contract I have been offered. ""I didn't put the gun to anyone's head and I can only show one way how much I want to do well for the club. ""I get offers but I always keep a note in my job that I go to the end of my contract. I wasn't ready to talk and for me it is important to focus and not talk about other clubs or opportunities that I have. ""The best way to focus is to extend the contract but the day I feel I cannot focus or take the team further I will go.'' Wenger recently persuaded Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas to stay with the club for another year after Spanish champions Barcelona tried to sign the 23-year-old. Fabregas was part of Spain's World Cup winning squad and joined Arsenal from Barcelona as a teenager. The influential midfielder is seen as key to Arsenal's title chances this season. Their next Premier League game is at home to newly-promoted Blackpool on Saturday.","Arsene Wenger signs a new three-year deal with Arsenal .

"(CNN) -- Serbia will face France in the final of the Davis Cup after a tense 3-2 semifinal victory over the Czech Republic in front of a passionate home support in Belgrade. The Czechs led 2-1 after winning Saturday's doubles rubber, meaning the hosts had to claim victory in both reverse singles to secure their first-ever appearance in the final. World number two Novak Djokovic, who missed Friday's opening singles with a stomach complaint, drew the two nations level at 2-2 when he recovered from the loss of the opening set to defeat Czech No.1 Tomas Berdych 4-6 6-3 6-2 6-4. It completed a miserable weekend for Wimbledon finalist Berdych, who lost both of his singles rubbers. That result means Janko Tipsarevic had to defeat the previously unbeaten Radek Stepanek to seal Serbia's final place and he did just that, winning 6-0 7-6 6-4 to send the 15,000 home supporters into raptures. There was less drama in the other semifinal, where France completed their domination over Argentina with a 5-0 whitewash victory in Lyon. The French led 3-0 going into the final day, meaning nothing rested on the results of the reverse singles rubbers. However, Gilles Simon's 7-6 6-7 6-3 defeat of Eduardo Schwank meant the whitewash became a possibility -- and it was completed when Arnaud Clement beat Horacio Zeballos 7-5 6-1. The victory ensures France, who dumped out holders Spain in the previous round, reached their first Davis Cup final since 2002.","Serbia secured their first Davis Cup final appearance, where they will face France .

"(CNN) -- English double winners Chelsea have completed their second major signing of the summer after swooping for Benfica's Brazilian international midfielder Ramires on Friday. The 23-year-old -- who starred for Brazil at the World Cup finals in South Africa -- has signed a four-year contract for a fee in the region of 20 million euros. The protracted transfer, which was held up because of work permit issues, has signed too late to make his debut in the opening Premier League match against West Bromwich Albion on Saturday. Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti told a press conference: ""He is a fantastic player, a fantastic midfielder. ""He is very young and will be the future of the Brazilian national team, and I hope he will be the future of Chelsea."" Speaking to the club's official website, former Cruzeiro midfielder Ramires added: ""Every player in the world would love to play for Chelsea. ""It's a great opportunity that was given to me, I will give my best to repay this chance, and I am very happy."" Ramires joins Yossi Benayoun, who joined from Liverpool, in signing for the London club this summer. However, a number of players have left Stamford Bridge since the 'Double' was won in May with Joe Cole, Michael Ballack, Juliano Belletti, Deco, Ricardo Carvalho and Scott Sinclair all departing over the close season.","English double winners Chelsea completed their second major signing of the summer .

"(CNN) -- UEFA have rejected Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp's call for artificial pitches to be banned after his side lost 3-2 to Young Boys in the Champions League playoffs. Redknapp was scathing about the plastic surface in Switzerland and said he was forced to rest several of his players due to their concerns about picking up injuries on the hard ground. Tottenham struggled to adjust to the pace of the pitch and the English Premier League side conceded three goals in a nightmare first 28 minutes of the match. Goals from Cameroon defender Sebastian Bassong and Russian striker Roman Pavlyuchenko brought Spurs back into the game but Jermain Defoe was forced off with a groin injury. Redknapp later called for the astroturf pitch to be banned for the Champions League -- a suggestion that UEFA swiftly rebuffed. A spokesman told CNN: ""All stadiums are inspected several times before a match to make sure the pitch, among others, complies with the enclosed regulations, would it be a natural or artificial turf. ""UEFA's regulations state that only the final of the Champions League must be played on grass."" Tottenham's narrow defeat means they should still be favorites for the return leg at White Hart Lane next week, but after the match Redknapp called for a change to the rules. ""I couldn't say it's a preferred surface,"" Redknapp told reporters. ""It's a good pitch but you have to get used to playing on it. It's not an excuse. ""I played on astroturf and hated every minute of it. We had it at QPR but we don't have it any more in England and personally I don't agree with it and I don't think astroturf should be used in a competition like this. ""I had a nasty feeling. I kept looking at the players training on the pitch and they didn't look happy. I had four players out because they weren't comfortable on the pitch in training. ""Aaron Lennon wasn't comfortable, Robbie Keane had a problem with his knee and Tom Huddlestone, the last time he played on astroturf he was out for six weeks."" Article 13.08 of UEFA's Champions League regulations states: ""With the exception of the final which must be played on natural turf, matches in the competition may be played on artificial turf in accordance with the UEFA Stadium Infrastructure Regulations and provided that such artificial turf meets the FIFA Recommended 2-Star Standard.""","UEFA rejects Tottenham's call for a ban on artificial pitches .

"(CNN)  -- France's Sebastien Ogier underlined his growing promise with a storming drive to win the Rally of Portugal, his maiden victory in the world championship. The 26-year-old led a sweep of the podium positions for the C4 Citroen team with reigning world champion Sebastien Loeb in second place, 7.9 seconds adrift. Spaniard Dani Sordo finished third at one minute 17.6 seconds. ""I'm incredibly happy, we had a perfect weekend, with a perfect car from start to finish,"" Ogier told the official WRC Web site. ""We attacked from the first to the last special without making a mistake even though we were under pressure from the best driver in the rally. It couldn't have been better."" Ogier, the junior world rally champion in 2008, has moved into second place in the title standings behind the all-conquering Loeb, who has 126 points after six rounds. Ogier, who finished second in New Zealand three weeks ago, is on 88 points with Finland's Mikko Hirvonen on 76. He went into the final day with a 21.1 seconds advantage on seven-time world champion Loeb, who mounted a late charge. Loeb pulled back 14 seconds by claiming the first four specials on Sunday, but could make no further impression. 2009 championship runner-up Hirvonen finished fourth in a Ford Focus as he overtook Norway's Petter Solberg, who crashed out in his Citroen C4 in the final SS18 near the finish.","Sebastian Ogier of France wraps up maiden win in world rally championship .

"(CNN) -- English double winners Chelsea have failed in a big-money move to sign Brazilian teenage sensation Neymar -- after the 18-year-old decided to remain with his home town club Santos. The London giants were reported to have offered in the region of 35 million euros for the midfielder, who scored for his country against the United States in a friendly last week. ""I feel very happy with Santos, that's why I'm staying,"" Neymar told reporters on Thursday. Brazilian media have claimed that the player's annual salary of $1 million per year is to be increased with merchandising deals following his decision to stay. In other transfer news, former Arsenal captain Williams Gallas is on the brink of a shock switch to rivals Tottenham. Gallas, who failed to agree a new contract with the Gunners at the end of last season, would become the first player to move across the north London divide since Sol Campbell's controversial switch from Tottenham to Arsenal in 20002. The 33-year-old is expected to sign a one-year contract and will be eligible to play in the Chamions League should Tottenham overcome Swiss side Young Boys in the second leg of their qualifying round tie. There has also been a surprise transfer in the Championship, the second tier of English football, with Crystal Palace luring former Dutch international Edgar Davids out of retirement. The 37-year-old former Juventus and Ajax star retired two years ago, but has been persuaded to return after  signing a one-year contract with the London club. Meanwhile, Italian giants Juventus have signed Serbian winger Milos Krasic from CSKA Moscow for a fee of 15 million euros. The 25-year-old will be presented to the Italian media on Saturday after agreeing a five-year contract with the Turin club. And Manchester United have confirmed that defender Nemanja Vidic has now signed a new four-year contract with the club. United announced last month that the 28-year-old had agreed to extend his stay at Old Trafford and the Serbian international center-half has officially sealed the deal.","English double winners Chelsea fail in a big-money move to sign Brazilian Neymar .

"(CNN)  -- ""Grow old along with me! /  The best is yet to be, / The last of life for which the first was made."" Robert Browning, 1864 . How quaint Browning's celebratory ode to aging is these days. Americans seem gripped with dread about an aging society. The alarm ""we can't afford it"" is ringing loudly all over the place, from congressional hearing rooms to corporate boardrooms to policy think tanks. The reason for the alarm is the federal government's rising tide of red ink. Retirement looms for the roughly 76 million baby boomers born between 1946 and 1964. The oldest members of the Woodstock generation could start collecting Social Security in 2008 and they'll be eligible for Medicare next year. And the core of the federal government's long-term debt-and-deficit problem is entitlement spending. Yet the widespread perception that Social Security, the oldest entitlement, is a basket case is deeply wrong. (In sharp contrast, health care spending is the driving force behind the scary budget projections.) There are looming financial concerns, but they're manageable from an economic point of view. There is no crisis. For one thing, when it comes to Social Security, and all public and private pensions for that matter, what really matters is the health of the economy. For example, the future Social Security tab is easy to meet if the U.S economy continues its average annual per capita growth rate of around 2 percent, which it has for the past half-century or so. Read the opposite view on retirement age . For another, the real Social Security concern lies with the  consensus on how to shore up the system's finances: Raising the age of retirement to, say, 70. It's the signature change that has gathered around it as close to a bipartisan consensus as is possible in today's fractured politics. Average life expectancy, so goes the argument, is  about 78 years. That's way above the average expectancy of 61 years when Social Security became law in 1935. We're also healthier and better educated. Therefore, we're told, it's feasible for most Americans to work longer and the change will relieve some of the system's long-term financial pressure. What's not to like? Everything. Mandating that folks retire later is a big step backward. Before the 1950s, retirement was for the rich. Most elderly Americans needed to earn an income and work was often hard to get. Yet with Social Security, and Medicare in 1965, a majority of aging workers could look forward to a period of fulfillment at the end of their working lives. It was a major social and economic achievement of the 20th century. The richer a society becomes, the more people spend on health care, education, leisure and, yes, early retirement. That's what wealthy societies do. This suggests that the public policy goal should be to lower the retirement age to, say, 50-something. Again, that's an age of retirement only the rich can afford. Why not create a comparable option for everyone? It sounds crazy, doesn't it? The idea is well outside the mainstream. But too much of the discussion about Social Security has taken a narrow bean-counter view of the system. The goal of reform should be to make the system better by enabling people to enjoy greater freedom of choice in the last third of life. Now, the choice may be work, full-time or part-time, paid or volunteer. It could mean learning more and heading off on various adventures. For many people it might involve nourishing their spiritual well-being and making a difference in their community. ""Today, ordinary people wish to use their liberated time to buy those amenities of life that only the rich could afford in abundance a century ago,"" writes Nobel laureate and University of Chicago economist Robert Fogel in ""The Fourth Great Awakening and the Future of Egalitarianism."" ""These amenities broaden the mind, enrich the soul, and relieve the monotony of much earnwork."" Fogel offers up a possible blueprint for accomplishing the goal of an earlier retirement. The transition might take several generations. It would require that everyone save when they're younger -- a universal mandatory savings requirement. Yet under very reasonable economic growth assumptions households that were required to set aside nearly 15 percent of their annual income into retirement savings would be financially free to pursue their passions in the mid-50s. For low-income people, he recommends boosting their savings with a tax of 2 or 3 percent ""applied progressively to the top half of the income distribution."" There are other ideas that would accomplish the same goal. Fogel's is one possible blueprint. To be sure, in these times it's hard to imagine that the economic resources are there to finance early retirement. But America remains the world's wealthiest nation. Social Security reform should build on economic opportunity, not embrace penury. We can afford it and, yes, the best is yet to be. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Chris Farrell.","Chris Farrell: ""We can't afford early retirement"" is alarmist; there's no Social Security crisis .
Farrell says public and private pensions depend on economy's 2 percent steady growth .
Mandating older retirement is a step backward, he writes. Wealthy societies don't do that .
The goal should be giving people freedom of choice in the last third of life, Farrell says ."
"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- One of two Taiwanese nationals injured in a shooting at a popular Old Delhi, India, tourist site remained in critical condition Monday after doctors removed a bullet from his abdomen, a hospital official said. Amit Banerjee, the medical superintendent of the hospital where the two tourists were being treated, added the other tourist is expected to be discharged soon. Meanwhile, the U.S. and Australian governments have issued safety advisories to their citizens after the shooting on Sunday. And two of India's largest cities -- Delhi and Mumbai -- are on red alert. Gunmen on a motorcycle fired multiple rounds at a tour bus, Karnail Singh of Delhi police told CNN sister network CNN-IBN on Sunday. ""One of the bullets grazed the head of one tourist and one has been hit in the stomach,"" Singh said. India's tourism minister, Kumari Selja, downplayed Sunday's shooting as a ""stray"" event aimed at creating panic. ""This attack on tourists shows desperation of those elements who want to create panic in the society by attacking innocent people,"" Selja said, according to a statement from her ministry. ""Investigation agencies are at work"" to apprehend the culprits, she said. India, she insisted, is a safe destination for tourists. Police, who continue the search for the suspects, said they think the attack is more likely to be the work of a criminal gang than a terror attack. The attack comes two weeks before the Commonwealth Games, which are expected to draw large crowds to the city. Thousands of athletes from around the world will converge on the city October 3 for the multi-sport event that is held every four years. ""U.S. citizens are urged to always practice good security, maintain a heightened situational awareness and a low profile,"" the U.S. Embassy posted on its website. ""U.S. citizens are advised to monitor local news reports and consider the level of security present when visiting public places, including religious sites."" The message follows a travel alert issued earlier this month about the Commonwealth Games in general: . ""The U.S. Mission in India alerts U.S. citizens traveling to or residing in India to safety and security issues related to the 2010 Commonwealth Games scheduled to be held in New Delhi, India, between October 3 and October 14, 2010, especially in light of the worldwide caution issued by the Department of State on August 12, 2010, regarding the continuing threat of terrorist actions and violence against U.S. citizens and interests throughout the world."" Athletes from more than 70 countries in Africa, North and South America, Asia, Europe, the Caribbean island nations and the South Pacific region are expected to take part in the games, which feature such sporting events as basketball, archery, table tennis, squash, badminton, bowling, gymnastics and swimming. On Monday, Australia warned its citizens in a travel advisory that the event carries a ""high risk of terrorism."" ""Australians in New Delhi should be aware that the Commonwealth Games will be held in a security environment where there is a high risk of terrorism,"" the advisory said. It added that New Delhi has seen at least 14 major terrorist attacks since 2000 in public places, such as markets and train stations. Police in New Delhi insist Sunday's shooting was not targeted at the games. ""It was a local mischief,"" police spokesman Rajan Bhagat said Monday. Security has, however, been stepped up in the Indian capital, he added. ""We assure full security not only for the games but also for the city,"" Bhagat said. CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh contributed to this report.","The U.S. and Australia issue safety advisories before the Commonweath Games .

"(CNN)  -- Italy's Valentino Rossi edged out Yamaha teammate and title rival Jorge Lorenzo to claim pole position for the French MotoGP at Le Mans. The top spot on the timesheets changed hands several times in an exciting qualifying session on Saturday, with defending champion Rossi setting the fastest time on the 28th of his 30 laps. Rossi lapped in one minute 33.408 seconds to edge championship leader Lorenzo by just 0.054 seconds. Spain's Dani Pedrosa claimed the third spot on the front row for Honda. Australian Casey Stoner also strongly challenged on his Ducati, but had to settle for fourth fastest, just ahead of teammate Nicky Hayden. Home rider Randy De Puniet and Andrea Dovizioso of Italy were sixth and seventh fastest. Colin Edwards of the United States, Suzuki's Loris Capirossi were eighth and ninth best with Aleix Espargaro completing the top ten with his last lap.

"Washington (CNN) -- More than 42 years after Air Force Chief Master Sgt. Richard L. Etchberger died on a Laotian mountaintop, President Barack Obama on Tuesday awarded him the Medal of Honor,  saying,  ""It's never too late to do the right thing.  It's never too late to pay tribute to our Vietnam veterans and their families."" Etchenberg's three sons were at the White House for the ceremony.  For decades they didn't know about their father's heroism. Cory Etchberger was in third grade in 1968, when he was told that his father had died in a helicopter accident in Southeast Asia.  At age 29 he learned the truth, when the U.S. Air Force declassified his father's story. ""I was stunned,"" he told CNN during a visit to his hometown of Hamburg, Pennsylvania. During the Vietnam War, U.S. troops weren't supposed to be in neutral Laos, so Richard Etchberger and a handful of colleagues shed their uniforms and posed as civilians to run a top secret radar installation high on a Laotian cliff.  Called Lima Site 85, it guided U.S. bombers to sites in North Vietnam and parts of Laos under communist control. ""Dick and his crew believed they could help turn the tide of the war, perhaps even end it,"" said Obama. The North Vietnamese wanted to eliminate the installation, and early on the morning of March 11, 1968, its soldiers succeeded in scaling the 3,000-foot precipice and launching an attack. Timothy Castle, of the CIA's Center for the Study of Intelligence, wrote the book ""One Day Too Long: Top Secret Site 85 and the Bombing of North Vietnam.""  He calls Etchberger ""a hero."" Castle said Etchberger, a technician, picked up an M-16 rifle, which he barely knew how to use, and ferociously protected his colleagues. One of them was Stanley Sliz. ""I got hit in both legs,"" Sliz remembered, ""and everybody was screaming and hollering, but they weren't able to get close because of Etch firing at them."" John Daniel still has scars from the shrapnel wounds he got that day. ""He (Etchberger) was the only one that didn't get injured in the firefight,"" Daniel recalled.  ""They kept throwing grenades and shooting, and we kept picking up hand grenades and throwing them, or kicking them to the other side of the mountain."" When a helicopter flown by CIA-affiliated Air America arrived to evacuate them, Etchberger braved enemy fire to load three wounded comrades, including Daniel and Sliz, onto hoists. ""Thank God for Dick Etchberger.  If it wasn't for him, I would not be alive today,"" Daniel told CNN. Etchberger made it onto the chopper alive and unwounded.  But as it began to pull away, enemy shots rang out. Sliz said he saw a splotch of red, and realized the man who had saved his life had lost his own.  One round had hit Etchberger and killed him. ""I live it every day,"" said Sliz.  ""I live it every day.  It haunts me."" President Obama said Etchberger ""lived the airmen's creed -- to never leave an airman behind, to never falter, to never fail."" Shortly after Etchberger's death, he was secretly awarded the Air Force Cross for bravery. He was recommended for the Medal of Honor, but then-President Lyndon Johnson rejected the idea, fearing it would expose the U.S. military's activities in Laos. A few years ago an airman who had never even known Etchberger wrote his congressman asking that the matter be reconsidered. Said Obama, ""The greatest memorial of all to Dick Etchberger is the spirit that we feel here today, the love that inspired him to serve...the love for his country and love for his family."" The president noted that the same love motivates troops serving today, ""And as Americans, we remain worthy of their example...by remaining true to the values and freedoms for which they fight.""

"(CNN) -- The storm previously known as Hurricane Igor sped past Newfoundland Tuesday, leaving behind downed trees, washed out roads and a desperate search for a missing elderly man. Igor slipped into a post-tropical status late Tuesday afternoon, losing its hurricane moniker in the process. But the storm still carried hurricane-force winds with a top sustained rate that had jumped to 86 mph (139 kph), according to the Canadian weather office. Sgt. Boyd Merrill of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said that the Mounties have responded to reports that an 80-year-old man was swept out to sea Tuesday morning when his driveway collapsed beneath him from the rain-fed water flow. The incident took place on Random Island near Britannia, Merrill said, and the harsh weather conditions have made the search difficult. With impassable roads and no air or sea travel available, he said, only local residents have been able to search the area. Marine Search and Rescue from St. John's was unable to get a helicopter into the air, and the Canadian Coast Guard vessel Ann Harvey was dispatched to the area and then recalled over safety concerns. A hurricane watch remained in effect for the Newfoundland coast from Stones Cove to Fogo Island, and a tropical storm warning was in effect for the entirety of the coast. But forecasters said they expected the hurricane watch to be discontinued later Tuesday night as the storm moves further from shore. A gust of 90 mph (144 kph) was reported at Bonavista, Newfoundland, according to the Miami, Florida-based National Hurricane Center. Igor's forward speed was slowing -- 27 mph (43 kph) -- and rainfall associated with the storm was decreasing. Igor was still expected to dump a total of 4 to 8 inches on the province, the Hurricane Center said. As of 8 p.m. ET, the center of Igor was about 240 miles (385 kilometers) east-northeast of Gander, Newfoundland. Forecasters said Igor would hold onto its hurricane-force winds for the day or so but gradually weaken as it crosses the into the Labrador Sea and onward to the Davis Strait, which separates Greenland and Canada. ""The center of Igor will continue to move away from the island of Newfoundland,"" forecasters said. It is expected to turn north-northeast and then north and to slow Tuesday night and Wednesday before heading northwest toward Baffin island. Large swells associated with Igor are expected to affect the U.S. East Coast through Tuesday and the southern coastlines of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland for the next couple of days, the Hurricane Center said. Swells will be slowly subsiding in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the island of Hispaniola and portions of the Bahamas over the next couple of days but could cause rip currents and heavy surf, forecasters said. The center of Igor reached its closest point to Bermuda -- about 40 miles (65 kilometers) west of the island -- late Sunday night and continued bringing fierce winds to the island on Monday. There were no reports of serious damage, injuries or deaths, but residents experienced widespread power outages. Some might not have power restored for weeks, CNN meteorologist Reynolds Wolf said, reporting from Bermuda. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Lisa formed Tuesday in the eastern Atlantic Ocean but posed no immediate threat to land. As of 5 p.m. ET, Lisa was barely moving about 535 miles (845 km) west-northwest of the Cape Verde Islands, according to the National Hurricane Center. Lisa carried maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kph). Forecasters said Lisa could increase rapidly in the next 24 hours.","NEW: Igor no longer a hurricane, but still carries hurricane force winds .

"Hassan Khail, Pakistan (CNN) -- The white bags land with a thud, a small cloud of dust billowing around them. But for Pakistanis like Tariq Jan, the simple sack may as well be gold. Each 30-kilogram sack contains enough animal feed to keep a donkey satisfied for a month. Without the United Nations donations, Tariq Jan would have no chance of restarting the life that he lost, washed away by the massive flooding that began in Pakistan almost two months ago. He used to own more than 40 animals. But many of them died when his house and his land drowned under torrents of gushing water. His family depends on the milk from the cows. ""They have gotten much thinner,"" he said of his animals. ""I am having a lot of trouble getting anything to eat for them."" The floodwaters submerged about 10 million acres, much of it in Punjab province, Pakistan's breadbasket, where people live off the soil and their livestock. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization has been trucking in animal feed and seeds to plant anew. ""We have to try and and get seeds in here and make sure they can get off food aid as fast as possible,"" the group's Truls Brekke said of the flood survivors. Tariq Jan used to profit from several acres of syrupy sugar cane. But now, without any help, it will take perhaps five years before he can clear the sludge and see new shoots again. But even the food aid is falling short. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced a few days ago that the United Nations is seeking another $1.594 billion for flood victims, bringing the total to more than $2 billion. The world body has received about 70 percent of the $460 million it initially requested. Farther south in Sindh, the floods are still adding to the ranks of the homeless. Every day, the United Nations is seeing 20,000 to 30,000 more people who have just lost their homes to rising waters. In all, more than 20 million people were affected by the floods. Waters from Lake Manchar are overflowing in five directions. Some people are referring to it as a ""lake burst,"" said Fawad Hussain, a U.N. relief coordinator for Sindh. ""First we had the rain, then the waters from the river and now the lake,"" Hussain said. ""We have not been able to scale up [the response] as quickly in the far south due to lack of funding."" There are people marooned in Pakistani villages who are still waiting for help. ""The monsoon rains may be over, but the floods are not,"" said Andro Shilakadze of UNICEF.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Three current or former Bell, California, city officials, accused of misappropriation of public funds, won bail reduction Wednesday. The arraignment for them and five others arrested in the case was postponed until October 21 after a defense attorney asked for more time. The bail for former City Manager Robert Rizzo was reset from $3.2 million to $2 million. Assistant City Manager Angela Spaccia's bail went from $377,000 to $350,000, and Mayor Oscar Hernandez won a $10,000 reduction to $275,000. City Council member Luis Artiga, former council member George Cole and Vice Mayor Teresa Jacobo showed that their bail funds come from legitimate sources and can post it anytime, a judge ruled. The charges allege that the officials misappropriated more than $5.5 million, including being paid for phantom meetings, District Attorney Steve Cooley said Tuesday. Rizzo, Spaccia and Police Chief Randy Adams resigned after media reports that they were making several hundred thousand dollars a year each. Adams was not charged, Cooley said. ""The complaint alleges they used the tax dollars collected from the hard-working citizens of Bell as their own piggy bank, which they looted at will,"" Cooley said. Other defendants are council member George Mirabal and former councilman Victor Bello. Rizzo, who was being paid nearly $800,000 annually, is charged with 53 counts of misappropriation of public funds and conflict of interest. Among the allegations are that he wrote his own employment contracts and that they were never approved by the City Council, prosecutors said. Cooley alleges that Rizzo, hired as Bell's chief administrative officer in September 1994, gave nearly $1.9 million in unauthorized loans to himself, Spaccia, Artiga, Hernandez and dozens of others. Rizzo is responsible for $4.3 million of the city's losses, Cooley said. Rizzo's attorney, Jim Spertus, said Cooley ensured that reporters witnessed the arrest of his client and called it ""grossly unprofessional."" ""Candidate Cooley wants some good campaign material,"" Spertus said, making reference to the district attorney's candidacy for California attorney general. ""[Rizzo's] salary was openly transparent to the City Council, and the council approved it,"" he said, adding that his client will fight the charges. Spertus also said the city's loan program followed procedures and that Cooley's office did not interview many pertinent witnesses. Prosecutors charged Hernandez, Jacobo, Mirabal, Cole, Bello and Artiga with nearly two dozen counts of misappropriating approximately $1.2 million of public funds. Cooley alleges that they held ""bogus meetings"" that lasted only minutes at a time -- or not at all -- and collected payment. ""The [council] for their part provided no checks, no balances,"" Cooley said. ""The council members were busy enriching themselves for collecting money for meetings that never occurred."" California Attorney General Edmund G. Brown recently sued several of the former officials ""to recover the excess salaries"" that Bell officials were being paid. He also was pursuing a reduction of their pension benefits. ""This is a very serious matter when public officials breach their duty to the public and enrich themselves with enormous obscene salaries which then trigger pensions of similar magnitude,"" Brown said. The suit accuses officials of fraud, civil conspiracy, waste of public funds and breach of fiduciary duty. It also alleges they deliberately misled citizens about the accurate amount of their pay. Bell, in southeast Los Angeles County, had 36,624 residents as of the 2000 census. The median annual income is less than $35,000. Rizzo's last annual base salary was $787,638, Adams earned $457,000, and Spaccia received $336,000, according to Brown's office. Before recently cutting their pay, Bell City Council members received $96,000 a year, compared with $4,800 a year earned by council members in similar-sized cities. Since 1993, the council raised Rizzo's salary 16 times, with an average jump of 14 percent yearly, the attorney general said. In 2005, he received an increase of 47 percent. Since 2001, City Council members also awarded themselves 16 percent raises yearly. Brown, who is running for governor, said Rizzo prepared a memo for the public saying council members received $673 a month and he was paid $15,478 a month, which would amount to annual salaries of about $8,000 and $185,000 respectively.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- The Indian nanny who saved the life of an Israeli boy during the Mumbai terror attacks in 2008 has been granted honorary citizenship and temporary residency in Israel. At a ceremony Monday, the Israeli interior ministry in Jerusalem handed Sandra Samuel her identity card. ""I hope I will honor the citizenship and love Israel. I would give my heart and soul for Israel,"" she said. Samuel has been caring for the boy, Moshe Holtzberg, since his parents died in the terror attacks on a Jewish cultural center, Chabad House, and several luxury hotels in India's financial capital. They were among six people who were killed at Chabad House. Altogether, more than 160 people died in the attacks. During the raids, 10 men also attacked buildings including the luxury Taj Mahal Palace and Tower and Oberoi-Trident hotels and the city's Chhatrapati Shivaji train station. The only surviving gunman, Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, a Pakistani, was convicted of murder, conspiracy, and waging war. Moshe's father, Rabbi Gavriel Noach Holtzberg, and his pregnant wife, Rivka, ran the Mumbai headquarters of the Chabad community -- a Hasidic Jewish movement. Samuel, who worked as a cook and nanny at the Chabad House, found Moshe -- who turned 2 just after the attacks -- standing between the bodies of his slain parents. She returned to Israel and has continued to care for the boy, helping his grandparents to raise him. ""Sandra Samuel stepped into the fire and abyss and did not think of herself,"" said Rabbi Shimon Rosenberg, Moshe's grandfather, at the ceremony. ""She saved Moshe from the fire and we as Jews must thank and respect her."" CNN's Michal Zippori contributed to this report.","Samuel: ""I would give my heart and soul for Israel""

"Harare, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwe's government has dropped charges against six health workers accused of dispersing AIDS/HIV drugs without appropriate documentation. ""The state is withdrawing charges against the accused,"" Chris Mutangadura, a senior lawyer with Zimbabwe's attorney general, told a Harare magistrate court Wednesday. Four Americans, a New Zealander, and a Zimbabwean were arrested in Harare two weeks ago. Police had accused the American health workers of dispensing AIDS drugs without proper registration and licences, claims they flatly denied. Before their arrest, the U.S. health workers had been working in Zimbabwe for almost a decade on HIV/AIDs projects and were  given a farm by the government to operate from in Mutoko, about 200 kilometers east of Harare. They have numerous patients, most of whom were AIDS orphans, at the farm. They also operated an AIDS clinic in Harare. The Americans belong to the Allen Temple Baptist Church AIDS Ministry in Oakland, California. The church serves a predominantly African-American congregation. Three or four times a year since 2000, members have paid their own way to Zimbabwe to give antiretroviral medicine, vitamins, clothing and food baskets to impoverished people with AIDS. ""The AG has been sympathetic to them because they are assisting the public,"" said Jonathan Samukange their lawyer as he left the magistrate court with his clients. The Americans are Dr. Anthony Jones, nurses David Greenberg and Gregory Miller, and Allen Temple Baptist Church AIDS Ministry administrator Gloria Cox-Crowell. They were working with two other doctors -- Reid Andrew Cheyne of New Zealand and Tembinkosi Ncomanzi of Zimbabwe.","The four Americans were from a California AIDS ministry .

"(CNN) -- A human rights group issued a new report detailing the widespread practice of female circumcisions in Iraqi Kurdistan, calling on Kurdish authorities to outlaw it. The 73-page report, released Wednesday by the group Human Rights Watch, cites previous studies estimating the circumcision rate for young women to range from 41 percent in a smaller sample of women up to 80 percent in larger studies. The Kurdish government does not keep statistics on female circumcisions or post-operative medial consequences. Human Rights Watch refers to the circumcisions as ""female genital mutilation."" The procedure involves partial or total removal of the clitoris, and is also known as clitoridectomy. The report describes the pain, fear, and physical and emotional distress that girls experience as they undergo the procedure. Although Islam does not mandate female circumcisions, some girls say it comes from the belief that anything they touch is unclean ""until they go through this painful procedure,"" according to the group. Critics say the intent is to oppress women, and to curtail female sexual desire, even if the surgery poses a health risk. The report, entitled "" 'They Took Me and Told Me Nothing:' Female Genital Mutilation in Iraqi Kurdistan,"" describes the pain and fear the girls and young women endure as they undergo the procedure, and the physical and emotional distress suffered afterward. It calls on the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government to ban the practice. ""FGM violates women's and children's rights, including their rights to life, health, and bodily integrity,"" said Nadya Khalife, Middle East women's rights researcher at Human Rights Watch. ""It's time for the regional government to step up to the plate and take concrete actions to eliminate this harmful practice because it simply won't go away on its own."" The authors interviewed Baxcha A., 22-year-old Kurdish married woman, in 2009. ""I was five,"" said Baxcha. ""My mother took us, me and my sister, to a midwife, and I ran away. They [later] held me by force and removed a piece of flesh from my body. They opened up my legs, and it was very painful. They put water and then ash on the wound."" The report says the previous regional government in Kurdistan decreed that anyone performing female circumcisions should be arrested and punished, but Human Rights Watch says it found no evidence the law is being enforced. The group acknowledged it won't be easy to change long-existing mindsets and traditions. ""Eradicating it in Iraqi Kurdistan will require strong and dedicated leadership on the part of the regional government, including a clear message that FGM will no longer be tolerated,"" Khalife said.","Report calls on authorities in Iraqi Kurdistan to ban female circumcision .

"(CNN) -- A southeastern South Carolina school reopened Wednesday, a day after a student opened fire at a school police officer and bomb squads dismantled several pipe bombs. A 14-year-old student was in custody in connection with the incident at Socastee High School in Conway, said a statement from the Horry County Police Department. Officers responding to a call of shots fired at the school about 2 p.m. found that the student allegedly confronted Horry County Police Officer Erik Karney and drew a gun, the statement said. ""A struggle ensued, and during the altercation, the student shot at Officer Karney."" Karney was not shot, but was injured from shrapnel, the statement said. Sgt. Robert Kegler of the Horry County Police Department said Tuesday the bullet struck a wall and shrapnel hit Karney's face. He was treated and released from a hospital after the student was detained. CNN affiliate WMBF reported the student was in Karney's office and opened fire with a handgun. The school was evacuated, and students were sent to the football field, police said. Authorities later heard allegations of explosive devices at the school, and summoned the bomb squad, which located ""several suspicious devices."" The devices, which were rendered safe, were later identified as pipe bombs, police said. The bomb squad went to the home of the student and executed a search warrant, the statement said. ""Horry County Police did locate and seize items consistent with the construction of pipe bombs and other incendiary devices"" at the home. The 14-year-old resides in Myrtle Beach, authorities said. He was in the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice in the state capital, Columbia, on Wednesday. The case remained under investigation, and charges had not yet been determined, police said. Teal Britton, spokeswoman for Horry County Schools, confirmed to WMBF that metal detectors were not used on students entering the school Tuesday morning. That will change Wednesday morning, she said. . CNN's Shawn Nottingham contributed to this report.","NEW: Devices identified as pipe bombs .

"(CNN) -- It's not as audible as the noise from vuvuzelas, but internet buzz over the 2010 FIFA World Cup has observers calling the tournament the biggest event in Web history. The tournament has surpassed the historic election of President Obama, which held that honor until now. According to Akamai, a content delivery network, the Web peaked at more than 12 million users per minute just two hours after the kickoff between South Africa and Mexico. By comparison, about 8.5 million people were logging on per minute the November evening that Obama was elected in 2008. Noisemakers were also sounding out on Twitter, which has been seeing big spikes in the number of tweets every time a big goal is scored. The site, which sees a daily average of 750 tweets per second, recorded a skyrocketing 2,940 after Japan scored against Cameroon last Monday. Nearly as much traffic was reported after Brazil's first goal against North Korea in its 2-1 victory that same day, as well as after Mexico's tying goal against South Africa on June 11. Still, it was an American favorite that scored Twitter's single-biggest moment. The Los Angeles Lakers' victory against the Boston Celtics at the NBA Championship last Thursday generated a record 3,085 tweets per second as the game ended. Read about fans keeping track of matches during office hours. Nonetheless, World Cup numbers have been so consistently high that Twitter was struggling to keep its ship afloat. The social networking site reported several outages attributed to high traffic specific to the World Cup. The site said on its blog that it is ""making real-time adjustments so that we can grow our capacity and avoid outages during the World Cup,"" and will allow users to monitor the status of the site. And it's not just the average (or angry) soccer fan who's tweeting. When the United States was denied a miracle comeback against Slovenia last week after a referee's controversial, late-game call, FIFA President Sepp Blatter turned to Twitter for a ""response"" to the resulting hullabaloo. He wrote: ""Thanks for all the questions on refereeing. My views on improving refs and video technology are here."" The link directs readers to a statement he made in March, explaining why there would be no instant replay at the World Cup, or anywhere else in world soccer, reported TIME.com. Twitter said Monday it could not immediately provide statistics on the number of tweets it received during that match. Blatter has been tweeting regularly since the start of the matches, with his vuvuzela tweet attracting nine followers per second, according to FIFA. The federation's website, FIFA.com, also has seen record-breaking numbers. Close to 300 million pages were accessed by nearly 10 million visitors when Brazil beat North Korea. It's a similar picture on TV. According to a report in Mediaweek, the first 14 matches of the World Cup, as seen on ESPN and ABC, have delivered an average of about 3.3 million viewers, which is a 64 percent increase from the same period in 2006, CNN.com reported Monday. The U.S.-England match, which ended in a tie June 12, drew 13 million viewers to ABC, making it the most-watched first round World Cup game in U.S. broadcast history.","The Web peaked at more than 12 million users per minute at the start of the World Cup .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- India approved a distinct symbol for its currency, the rupee, Thursday, joining the league of currencies identifiable by their unique signs. Up to this point, the Indian rupee has been denoted by ""Rs"" or the abbreviation INR. The new symbol, which looks like an R in Hindi, with an intersecting horizontal line, was selected after a public contest involving 3,000 designs, Ambika Soni, India's information and broadcasting minister, said. The move to give to its currency a new recognition stems from the country's economic growth, the minister said. ""The symbol for the rupee would lend a distinctive character and identity to the currency and further highlight the strength and robustness of the Indian economy as also a favored destination for global investments,"" Soni said. She also noted that the symbol would help distinguish the Indian rupee from the namesake currencies of several other nations like Pakistan, Nepal and Sri Lanka. Apart from citing her country's rapid integration with the global economy as a reason for adopting a symbol for the Indian rupee, Soni also noted the cultural importance to the new currency, because of its resemblance to Hindi's R. The symbol ""reflects and captures the Indian ethos and culture,"" she said. One of the world's few growth markets after the global recession, India expects its gross domestic product to grown 8.5 percent in 2010-11, despite being faced with a consolidated fiscal deficit of 8.4 percent.","India designates unique symbol to represent its currency, the rupee .

"New York (CNN) -- A federal judge Thursday sentenced a Pakistani scientist convicted of attempting to kill Americans in Afghanistan to 86 years in prison. A jury in Manhattan convicted Aafia Siddiqui on seven charges, including attempted murder and armed assault on U.S. officers, in February. She will serve her sentence at a facility in Texas where she was previously held while awaiting trial. Prosecutors said Siddiqui picked up a rifle and shot at two FBI special agents, a U.S. Army warrant officer, an Army captain and military interpreters while she was being held unrestrained at an Afghan facility on July 18, 2008. The agents returned fire shooting her in the abdomen. Afghan police had arrested her outside the Ghazni governor's compound in central Afghanistan after finding her with bomb-making instructions, excerpts from the ""Anarchist's Arsenal,"" papers with descriptions of U.S. landmarks, and substances sealed in bottles and glass jars, according to the charges. The indictment said Siddiqui had ""handwritten notes that referred to a 'mass casualty attack'"" listing several locations in the United States and ""construction of 'dirty bombs.'"" Upon her conviction, the American-educated neuroscientist, blasted the decision as ""a verdict from Israel, not America.""  Siddiqui's family said she had been unjustly convicted. At her sentencing Thursday morning, the 38 year-old MIT graduate shook her head in defiance and wagged her finger in a ""no"" gesture as U.S. District Judge Richard M. Berman laid out the case against her. But Siddiqui was more subdued when Berman allowed her to speak before the packed courtroom filled with family, spectators and foreign and national press. Clad in a khaki suit and a hijab that covered most of her face, Siddiqui repeatedly asked her Muslim supporters to not ""get emotional."" ""I don't want any violence in my name,"" Siddiqui said of demonstrations in her native Pakistan, where her case has become a cause celebre.  ""If you do anything for me, please educate people about Islam because people don't understand that it is a religion of mercy."" Before the judge sentenced Siddiqui to more than eight decades in prison, defense attorney Dawn Cardi told the court that it was the most difficult case of her career. ""Dr. Siddiqui is an enigma,"" Cardi said of her client, who had attempted multiple times to fire her team of attorneys hired by the government of Pakistan.  Cardi said there were many unanswered questions in her client's case, including where she was between the years of 2003 and 2008, when Siddiqui claims to have been held in a secret prison. ""The government has not admitted to secret prisons or torture.  But the information is going to come out,"" Cardi said, noting that solitary confinement had taken a visible toll on Siddiqui who ""had diminished mental capacity."" Since 2003, the whereabouts of Siddiqui had been the source of much speculation. According to Amnesty International, Siddiqui and her three small children were reported apprehended in Karachi, Pakistan, in March 2003, shortly after the FBI issued an alert requesting information about her location. Several reports indicated that Siddiqui was in U.S. custody after her arrest in Karachi. But in May 2004, then-Attorney General John Ashcroft and FBI Director Robert Mueller identified Siddiqui as being among several sought-after al Qaeda members. Siddiqui was extradited to the United States in August 2008, after the shooting incident. ""We are going to look back on this era in our country and we are going to say that fear is what drove our sentences,"" Cardi said. ""Despite the fact that this is a woman of peace who has repeatedly said she doesn't support any acts of vengeance in her name, I fear that the injustice done to her will cause outrage throughout the Muslim world,"" said Tina Foster, executive director or International Justice Network and spokesperson for the Siddiqui family. Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara hailed the sentence, commending federal and military investigators in the case. ""As a unanimous jury found beyond a reasonable doubt, Aafia Siddiqui attempted to murder Americans serving in Afghanistan, as well as their Afghan colleagues. She now faces the stiff consequences of her violent actions."" But Elaine Sharp, one of Siddiqui's defense attorneys, said, ""We just put someone in prison for the rest of her life who is mentally ill.""

"(CNN) -- A view prevalent in Europe is that older workers should retire to make room for younger people. This view is often referred to as the ""lump of labor"" theory, whereby the number of jobs is fixed and any job held by an older worker is one less available for a younger person. In Europe, this view has resulted in very early retirement ages under countries' public pension systems. Fortunately, the lump of labor theory has never gained much traction in the United States, where economists and policymakers believe that the internal dynamics of a market economy will tend to create enough jobs to accommodate available workers. And, during periods of recession, monetary or fiscal policy can help return the economy to full employment. The most dramatic evidence of the economy's ability to absorb new workers is the flow of women into the labor force both here and abroad in the last few decades. In the United States, between 1970 and 2000, the number of women working increased by about 34 million, as the percentage of women employed moved from 40 percent to almost 60 percent of the female population. Click for the opposite view on retirement age . Despite this enormous influx of women, the employment rate of men changed relatively little. Further, an international comparison shows no relationship between the increase in the female employment rate and change in the male employment rate. A similar relationship should apply to older and younger workers. A preliminary analysis across states shows no evidence that states with more older people in the labor force have fewer young people working. Thus, with proper policy, the U.S. labor market should be able to absorb young and old, as well as men and women. Rejecting the lump of labor theory, the United States has always had much later retirement ages than its European counterparts. This pattern has held down the cost of the U.S. public pension system. Going forward, longer work lives, both here and abroad, will be necessary in order to have affordable and secure retirements. People are living longer; those retiring at 65 can expect to live for almost 20 years in retirement, on average. The probability of living longer than average is significant. A 65-year-old  married couple has a 50 percent chance that one member will live to age 92. Given the prospect of such a long retirement, people need a very large pile of retirement assets to support themselves. For most people, it is not possible to accumulate that much over their work lives as they raise and educate their families. The need to accumulate more retirement assets coincides with a contraction in our retirement income system, which consists of Social Security and publicly supported and regulated employer-sponsored plans. At any given retirement age, Social Security benefits will replace a smaller fraction of pre-retirement earnings as the full retirement age rises from 65 to 67, higher deductions for Medicare premiums further reduce benefits and an increasing share of benefits will be subject to taxation under the personal income tax. At the same time, less than half the private sector work force is covered by any type of employer-provided plan at any moment in time. And those lucky enough to have coverage have seen defined benefit plans replaced by 401(k)s, where balances for those approaching retirement average only about $60,000. The answer to longer life expectancy and a contracting retirement system is for people to stay in the work force longer. This adjustment should be entirely feasible given that older people are healthier and better educated than they have been in the past and jobs are less physically demanding. A longer work life provides enormous financial benefits. A person retiring at 70 receives a Social Security monthly benefit 75 percent greater than someone retiring at 62. Delaying retirement also allows time for 401(k) balances to grow. And working longer sharply reduces the period over which people have to support themselves with accumulated retirement assets. Work also keeps people mentally and physically healthy by providing structure, social interaction and a sense of accomplishment. In normal times, extending the work lives of older Americans should have no effect on the ability of younger workers to find a job. The United States is a dynamic economy, which -- on its own and through appropriate policy decisions -- can accommodate all those looking for employment. Of course, these are not normal times, and the fact that older workers have been so much more successful during this recession at holding on to their jobs than younger workers has allowed the ""lump of labor"" theory to surface as a plausible model. But no evidence exists to support such a theory. And in the long run, both young and old will be better off if work lives are extended. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alicia H. Munnell.","Alicia Munnell: ""Lump of labor"" theory says older workers must retire to make way for young .
But economy creates jobs for young workers without older ones retiring early, she writes .

"New Haven, Connecticut (CNN) -- A man accused of killing three members of a Connecticut family and setting their home ablaze in a 2007 home invasion told police after his arrest that he was ""desperate for money,"" the officer who interviewed him testified Wednesday. Steven Hayes is charged with capital murder, kidnapping, sexual assault, burglary and arson in the July 2007 deaths of Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her daughters, Hayley Petit, 17, and Michaela Petit, 11. Hayes and co-defendant Joshua Komisarjevsky -- who will be tried separately -- also are accused of beating and tying up Dr. William Petit and leaving him in the basement while they attacked Hawke-Petit and Michaela Petit, ransacked the home and set it afire. Hayes, who has pleaded not guilty, could face the death penalty if convicted. Public defender Thomas Ullmann conceded in the defense's opening statement that Hayes killed Hawke-Petit but said that, otherwise, much of what happened is unclear. ""No one was supposed to be hurt,"" he said. ""What is known is that Steven Hayes kills and assaults Mrs. Petit. ... We concede much, but not all."" Connecticut State Police Detective Anthony Buglione testified that he was assigned to interview Hayes after the incident and noted ""a strong odor of gasoline emanating from Mr. Hayes' body."" ""There was no emotion,"" Buglione testified. ""I remember him being very flat, pretty quiet."" Hayes told the detective that he and Komisarjevsky met in a halfway house while both were on parole about a year and a half earlier and the two attended Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous meetings together and became friends, according to Buglione's report. Buglione said Hayes told him ""that lately life sucked and he was on a downhill slide. He said that he had no money, no car and not enough food to eat."" Hayes said he had been working as a laborer in Stamford until his mother told him he could no longer use her car to get to the job, the report says. And she had given him until the end of the week to move out of her house, it says. ""He had called Josh and told him he was desperate for money,"" the detective testified. ""Josh asked him how serious he was, and Mr. Hayes said he was very serious."" The two devised a plan to ""break into a house, tie some people up, grab some money and get out as fast as they could,"" Buglione said. They purchased a BB gun, he said, ""to just scare some people."" On July 23, fortified with a beer and a shot from a visit to a bar, the two men parked Komisarjevsky's mother's van, covered their faces with masks and ""walked up to the back of a house"" after 2 a.m., the report says. Hayes recounted that the two saw a man asleep on the rear porch; Komisarjevsky entered the home through an unlocked basement door, walked to the porch and struck the man in the head four to five times with a baseball bat, Buglione said. The two tied up the man with rope they found in the basement, Buglione said. ""They began to search for money but didn't find as much as they thought there should be,"" Buglione said. The two men then went upstairs and found Hawke-Petit and Michaela asleep in the master bedroom, he said. After tying Hawke-Petit to her bed, they led the girl to her room, tied her to her bed and put a pillowcase over her head, he said. They then found Hayley Petit in her room and did the same, he said. After finding a Bank of America account that contained $20,000 to $30,000, they decided to wait until morning and have the mother go to the bank and withdraw money from her account, Buglione says Hayes told him. ""Hayes said that they spent the rest of the night drinking beer from the family refrigerator,"" the report says. At one point Hayes drove to a gas station to fill up some gallon jugs with gasoline, Buglione testified Hayes told him. While Hawke-Petit and Hayes were at the bank, Komisarjevsky was to put the others in one of the family's cars and burn down the house to destroy evidence, Buglione said. Hayes said he drove Hawke-Petit to the bank and she withdrew $15,000, the report says. Jurors saw bank surveillance video of Hawke-Petit explaining her predicament to the teller. The teller testified Monday that she notified her manager after Hawke-Petit said she needed the money ""because she and her family were being held hostage at her house."" When they returned to the house, Komisarjevsky tied up Hawke-Petit, Buglione said, recounting what Hayes told him. Hayes also said that Komisarjevsky told him he had assaulted Michaela, according to Buglione. ""Hayes said that Josh told him that he had to have sex with the mother to square things up,"" the report says. Hayes said he then raped the mother, it says. After that, Hayes told police, ""things began to get out of control,"" Buglione said. Hayes recounted smelling gas and said Komisarjevsky yelled that Petit had escaped and they needed to get out of the house. The two men grabbed the cash, the masks and a bag containing jewelry, and jumped into the family's Chrysler Pacifica and drove off, it says. Buglione said Hayes said nothing about a fire being set. By this time, police had been alerted. After Hawke-Petit had left the bank, the manager called 911 at 9:21 a.m., and the first unit arrived at the home about 9:30 a.m. The officers testified that they were instructed to not enter the home, so they instead secured the street and awaited further instruction. By 9:58 a.m., the house was on fire, and the suspects had already departed in the family's Pacifica. They didn't get far. The suspects collided with two police cars and were forced to a stop, Detective Joseph Vitello testified. Inside the car, police found items allegedly taken from the home, including an iPod station, pearl necklaces belonging to Hawke-Petit and Michaela, and a Louisville slugger baseball bat from the garage. Inside the home, Hawke-Petit, 48, was found strangled, while Hayley and Michaela died of smoke inhalation. William Petit, the sole survivor of the attack, and a number of the victims' relatives left the courtroom before testimony from Dr. Wayne Carver, Connecticut's chief medical examiner, who warned jurors, ""You'll be seeing some very disturbing photos."" In his testimony, Petit reconstructed the timeline of events. He testified that he had spent the evening before the attack with his family eating dinner and reading the newspaper while the others watched ""Army Wives"" in the family room. He awoke around 3 a.m. to find blood running down his face and two men standing over the couch. Birds were singing when the men took him to the basement, tied him to a pole -- his wrists and ankles bound -- and left him there, he testified. Petit said that, at one point he heard ""three loud noises, like someone was throwing 20- or 30-pound sacks on the living room floor."" With his ankles still tied together, Petit said, he managed to make it out of the home and to the home of his neighbor, who called 911. The trial was interrupted last Thursday because of concerns over Hayes' health. It was further delayed when presiding Superior Court Judge Jon Blue fell ill Sunday and was hospitalized. Blue was released from the hospital Monday and returned to court Wednesday and told the court he had passed his medical tests ""with flying colors."" The deaths shocked the affluent Connecticut suburb of Cheshire, where Petit is a prominent endocrinologist. His wife was a pediatric nurse who did not let multiple sclerosis keep her from working or raising a family. Hayley had just graduated from Miss Porter's School, a prestigious private school that counts Gloria Vanderbilt and Jackie Kennedy among its alumnae. The deaths also led to a public outcry for Connecticut to strengthen its laws against repeat offenders when it was learned that the suspects had been convicted of multiple felonies. Citing the Cheshire case, Gov. M. Jodi Rell vetoed a resolution that would have eliminated the death penalty in the state.

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal fired an ominous warning that he is ready to reclaim his French Open crown from Roger Federer after picking up a record-equaling sixth consecutive Monte Carlo Masters title on Sunday. The world No. 3 earned his first tournament success in 11 months as he routed fellow Spaniard Fernando Verdasco 6-0 6-1 to complete a triumphant return to his favored clay surface. The 23-year-old has had a difficult past year after his shock defeat at the French Open to eventual losing finalist Robin Soderling, with Federer earning his first win at Roland Garros. Nadal needed surgery on his knees after that setback, and his hiatus allowed Federer to take both his Wimbledon title and the No. 1 ranking. The Mallorcan reached the semifinals in his past two tournaments on hardcourts surfaces in the United States, and blitzed his opponents in Monaco as three times he dropped only one game in a match. ""For me, it is very emotional,"" Nadal, who equaled the 106-year-old record of six Monte Carlo titles held by Englishman Reggie Doherty, told the ATP Tour Web site. ""It is probably my favorite tournament. I love this tournament. To win here another time is a dream for me. The atmosphere here is unbelievable. I feel like I'm at home. ""No one match during seven years have I felt the crowd against me. I just can say thank you very much everybody."" Nadal's only defeat at the tournament was against Guillermo Coria as a 16-year-old in 2003, and world No. 12 Verdasco never looked like registering his first win over his compatriot in 10 encounters. ""He had an unbelievable day and he played really good. I also didn't maybe have a good day, because I was trying to force and made more mistakes than unusual,"" said Verdasco, who was playing in his first Masters 1000 tournament final after thrashing world No. 2 Novak Djokovic 6-2 6-2 on Saturday. Nadal, by comparison, drew level with Federer on 16 Masters titles, behind only the 18 won by American Andre Agassi. He has now won 54 successive matches on clay in the month of April, with six titles in Monte Carlo and five in Barcelona in that time. Federer, who has not played since the Miami Masters last month, is set to make his return to the circuit at the Rome clay event starting on April 25. Nadal will be top seed at the Barcelona Open starting next week, with the draw also including Sweden's Soderling, Verdasco, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France and Monte Carlo semifinalist David Ferrer. The French Open, the second grand slam tournament of the tennis season, begins in Paris on May 24. Meanwhile, Samantha Stosur of Australia won her second title on the women's WTA Tour circuit on Sunday. The fourth seed, ranked 11th in the world, drubbed Russian No. 7 Vera Zvonareva 6-0 6-3 in the final of the Family Circle Cup on green clay in Charleston, South Carolina. Zvonareva had made it into the title match after world No. 2 Caroline Wozniacki retired with an ankle injury during their semifinal on Saturday.","Rafael Nadal wins a record-equaling sixth consecutive Monte Carlo Masters title .

"(CNN) -- A 400-year-old tradition is facing some new challenges this year at this week's annual running of the bulls in Spain. Celebrations for the San Fermin festival are already underway, but the first running of the bulls will be held Wednesday in the northern Spanish town of Pamplona. The city is once again handing out 100,000 leaflets to local and foreign festival-goers explaining how to minimize the risk of accidents during the spectacle. It's a warning and a reminder of the dangers and even death that can occur when hundreds of runners sprint alongside the half-ton bulls and steers. Last year saw the first fatal goring in more a decade. For the sixth year now, Pamplona has sprayed the entire 825 meter route with a special anti-slipping chemical to help avoid injury to the bulls and the red-and-white clad runners. The run in Pamplona started 400 years ago and became popular worldwide after author Ernest Hemingway wrote about it in the 1920s in his book ""The Sun Also Rises,"" also published under the title ""Fiesta."" The event is held July 7-14. Six bulls and a pack of tame steers run from the corrals, through Pamplona's old town, to the bullring -- where the bulls will die later in the day in a bullfight. Including the recent death, 14 people have been killed in the runs since 1924, when record-keeping began. But while the narrow cobblestone streets of Pamplona are expected to be as packed as ever, the tradition of bullfights, or ""corridas"" is under pressure elsewhere. The economic downturn is certainly taking its toll. With nearly one in five Spaniards out of a job there are fewer spectators packing the rings. And struggling towns are looking for ways to slash spending. Some local governments are cutting the expensive spectacles to save money for basic services like schools and police salaries. But there is also pressure brewing to change cultural attitudes about the tradition of bullfighting as well. Just as most other years, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and other animal rights groups organized a rally Sunday featuring semi-nude protesters covered in red paint in Pamplona, but also have staged protests outside Spanish embassies around the world. The tactics may be gaining some traction. A 2006 Gallup poll showed more than 70 percent of those surveyed said they have ""no interest"" in bullfighting, while 82 percent of those aged 15 to 24 held that same view. And now the tradition has begun facing legal and political challenges. The government in the northeastern Spanish region of Catalonia plans to hold a vote on banning the practice, potentially making it the second region in Spain to outlaw bullfighting after the Canary Islands in the Atlantic did so in 1991. While Pamplona embraces tradition, one thing you won't be seeing -- or hearing -- this year... the incessant buzz of the ""vuvuzela!"" The government there has banned the sale of the plastic horns along the bull-run route, saying they would be dangerous and distracting to the animals.","400-year-old tradition facing challenges on many fronts .

"(CNN)  -- Cricket's leading wicket-taker Muttiah Muralitharan has confirmed that he will retire from Tests later this month. The 38-year-old Sri Lanka spin bowler will bow out of the five-day game on home soil against the world's top-ranked team India in Galle from 18-22 July. He had been expected to quit during November's series against the West Indies, but has brought forward his retirement. Muralitharan, who has taken 792 wickets in 132 Test matches, will still be available for limited-overs internationals and may yet play at the 2011 World Cup which Sri Lanka will co-host along with India and Bangladesh. He has taken 84 more wickets in Tests than his closest rival Shane Warne, who retired in 2007, and 437 more than the highest-ranked player to have played a Test this year -- India's Harbhajan Singh. ""Champion spinner Muttiah Muralitharan has decided to retire from Test cricket,"" said a statement on Sri Lanka Cricket's official website on Tuesday. ""Mr Muralitharan has had discussions with the national selectors, SLC officials and has had the blessings of His Excellency the President Mahinda Rajapakse and the Minister of Sports, Hon. C.B. Ratnayake."" The SLC said it would hold a press conference in ""due course"" to announce further details of the cricketer's retirement. Muralitharan is widely considered to be the greatest bowler his country has ever produced. In addition to his Test feats, he has also taken a record-breaking 515 wickets in 337 one-day internationals. However, over the course of his 19-year career the Sri-Lankan's unusual bent-arm bowling action has come under scrutiny from umpires and players, who have questioned its legality. But despite several investigations, the International Cricket Council failed to find the bowler guilty of any wrongdoing. Muralitharan's manager said the player had changed his mind about retiring in November when the three-match India series -- which begins in Galle and finishes in Colombo next month -- was added to the Test calendar. ""Murali took a decision to retire from Test cricket during the West Indies series in November, but with an unscheduled Indian series coming up he has fast-tracked his retirement from Test cricket,"" Kushil Gunasekara told the Cricinfo website. ""The selectors want Murali to be around just in case they don't find a suitable replacement for him for the 2011 World Cup. They probably want the spinners to work around Murali."" Cricinfo reported that Muralitharan would not be available for the one-day tri-series after the India matches, which also involves New Zealand.","Spin bowler Muttiah Muralitharan has confirmed that he will retire from Test cricket .

"(CNN) -- A federal judge has ordered the reinstatement of an openly lesbian former Air Force major who was dismissed from the military under the government's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy. Judge Ronald Leighton of Tacoma, Washington, made his ruling Friday. It is the latest legal and political setback for the Obama administration, which is seeking to end the policy through a legislative and executive solution. Maj. Margaret Witt, a decorated flight nurse with 20 years of service, had sued to return to the Air Force Reserve. She was honorably discharged in July 2007 on the grounds that she had a six-year relationship with another woman, a civilian. ""Her discharge from the Air Force Reserves violated her substantive due process rights under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. She should be restored to her position as a flight nurse with the 446th AES as soon as is practicable,"" wrote the judge. An Air Force spokesman said the Air Force believes that ""Major Witt's discharge was fully consistent with the law and thus appropriate."" ""While we are disappointed the district court judge did not agree that important Congressionally-recognized military interests were furthered by Major Witt's discharge, we are pleased he allowed the government to develop a more detailed factual record for the appellate courts to consider,"" said Lt. Col. Todd Vician. The ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy enacted in 1993 prevents gay men and lesbians from openly serving in the military and bars officials from inquiring into a service member's sexuality. The Senate this week temporarily turned aside legislation to repeal the law. Witt joined the Air Force in 1987 and was suspended in 2004, after her superiors discovered her personal relationship with the civilian woman. At the time, she worked for an air-medical transport unit that evacuated and treated wounded soldiers. She was described in employee reports and by trial witnesses as an ""exemplary officer"" who was an effective leader, caring mentor, and skilled clinician. She had hid her homosexuality for years. The judge found no compelling reason for her dismissal. ""The application of 'don't ask, don't tell' to Major Margaret Witt does not significantly further the government's interest in promoting military readiness, unit morale and cohesion,"" he wrote. In 2006, Leighton had ruled against Witt, but a federal appeals court had ordered him to take another look at the case. A six-day federal trial had wrapped up earlier this week, and Leighton had openly indicated he would likely rule in Witt's favor. ""My colleagues -- my friends -- said, 'Ron, you got it wrong,""' Leighton said near the end of the trial, referring to his earlier decision. ""They told me what I needed to do, what I needed to ask."" The judge is a 2002 Bush appointee. Witt's lawyers from the ACLU argued that the Spokane native's sexuality never led to any problems within her unit. Several members of her squadron had testified they would welcome her back. ""Today we heard the hammer of justice strike for Major Margaret Witt,"" said ACLU of Washington Executive Director Kathleen Taylor. ""We look forward to the day when all members of our military can serve our country without invidious discrimination. To discharge her simply because of her sexual orientation was entirely unfair to her and unwise for the military, which needs her significant skills."" Witt was released just before she was set to retire with full benefits. The judge rejected a separate argument from Witt that her procedural due process rights were violated. Leighton said the Air Force gave her full notice of the charges against her and she was given the opportunity to challenge the charges. Air Force lawyers argued the military -- not the courts -- was in the best position to evaluate and enforce the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy. A federal judge in California earlier this month had similarly ruled the policy unconstitutional. That judge will soon rule on whether the Pentagon will be barred from enforcing it. President Barack Obama is pushing for a repeal of the controversial policy. A bill that would overturn the measure after a Pentagon review is completed in December is currently before Congress. More than 12,500 gays have been booted from the military since ""don't ask, don't tell"" went into effect.","NEW: Air Force: ""Witt's discharge was fully consistent with the law""

"Washington (CNN) -- Three U.S. senators introduced legislation Monday to specifically ban so-called ""crush videos"" -- depictions of small animals being tortured to death by humans. The legislation came in response to a Supreme Court ruling this year striking down a broader congressional law dealing with animal cruelty. The bi-partisan Animal Crush Video Prohibition Act would criminalize the creation, sale and marketing of these specific kinds of videos. Penalties of up to seven years in prison would be possible. The videos mostly depict women -- with their faces unseen -- stomping helpless animals such as rabbits to death with spiked-heel shoes or with their bare feet. The videos apparently satisfy a sexual fetish for those who produce and watch them, said animal rights activists who supported the new bill. ""Our legislation would ban animal crush videos that fit squarely within the obscenity doctrine -- a well-established exception to the First Amendment,"" said Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Arizona, a co-sponsor. ""It also takes the important step of banning non-commercial distribution of animal crush videos, which is necessary given the nature of the Internet and the propagation of file-sharing and peer-to-peer networks that exist today."" Sens. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, and Richard Burr, R-North Carolina, also helped draft the legislation. The lawmakers said the high court ruling opened the door for Congress to craft a ""narrowly tailored"" bill aimed at banning this specific type of commercial activity. The justices by an 8-1 margin struck down a broader 1999 federal law designed to stop the sale and marketing of videos showing dogfights and other acts of animal cruelty, saying it was an unconstitutional violation of free speech. That specific case dealt with a Virginia man who sold videos of dogs fighting each other at an overseas location. But in dissent, Justice Samuel Alito focused his attention on crush videos. ""The animals used in crush videos are living creatures that experience excruciating pain. Our society has long banned such cruelty,"" he said. The courts, he said, have ""erred in second-guessing the legislative judgment about the importance of preventing cruelty to animals."" Alito at the time predicted more crush videos would soon flood the underground market, because the ruling has ""the practical effect of legalizing the sale of such videos."" Lawmakers had promised to craft bills banning those types of videos. It was unclear if further legal challenges would result if the legislation passes with the president's signature. When it came to dog-fighting videos, ""The First Amendment itself reflects a judgment by the American people that the benefits of its restrictions on the government outweigh its costs,"" said Chief Justice John Roberts. He concluded Congress had not sufficiently shown ""depictions"" of dogfighting were enough to justify a special category of exclusion from free speech protection. Nearly every state and local jurisdiction have their own laws banning mistreatment of wild and domesticated animals, and usually handle prosecutions of animal cruelty. Several media organizations had supported Robert Stevens -- the man behind the dogfighting videos -- worrying the federal law could implicate reports about deer hunting, and depictions of bullfighting in Ernest Hemingway novels. Roberts suggested last April a law specifically banning crush videos might be valid, since it would be narrowly tailored to a specific type of commercial enterprise. Alito noted that would not help dogs forced to fight each other, where, he said, ""the suffering lasts for years rather than minutes."" The government had argued a ""compelling interest"" in stopping people who would profit from dog-attack tapes and similar depictions. Roberts dismissed suggestions by the Justice Department that only the most extreme acts of cruelty would be targeted. ""The First Amendment protects against the government,"" Roberts said. ""We would not uphold an unconstitutional statute merely because the government promised to use it responsibly."" The Humane Society, other animal rights groups and 26 states backed the government. If that 1999 law had been upheld, it would have been only the second time the Supreme Court had identified a form of speech undeserving of protection by the First Amendment. The justices in 1982 banned the distribution of child pornography.","The legislation is aimed at ""crush videos,"" showing the deaths of small animals .

"(CNN) -- The princess birthday cake for a 3-year-old girl was one of the few things left untouched after a brawl that police said involved 75 people at a hall in suburban Cincinnati, Ohio. Some 150 people were at a party at the Fraternal Order of Eagles Hall in Elmwood Place when the fight started early Tuesday, CNN affiliate WCPO reported. Seven police jurisdiction were called in to quell the fighting. ""When (first responding) officers arrived there it was a pretty intense fight going on inside,"" Elmwood Place Police Chief William Peskin said. ""They actually had to wait until they got back-up there in order to make entry because there were so many people throwing bottles and chairs, so they had to actually wait."" Police said the hall the was being rented out and the fraternal organization's membership was not involved. ""We got caught up in a family feud,"" Eagles member David Frost told CNN on Tuesday night, referring to the group that rented the Eagles' hall for the party. ""We're embarrassed by this."" Members cleaned up the shards of glass and damaged chairs and a table Tuesday, said Frost, adding that his organization may revisit its policies on rentals. The party organizers brought their own alcohol, he said. ""I hate to see anybody get hurt,"" Frost added. The fight apparently broke out between the birthday girl's father and her mother's boyfriend, police said. Police charged the girl's 26-yaer-old father with disorderly conduct, WCPO said. Four others possibly face charges in the fracas. Fifteen people were injured in the melee, with at least five hospitalized, including one person who required surgery to the eye due to a cut from a beer bottle, police said. Police told WCPO beer bottles were the primary weapons used in the bloody melee. One person in the back threw as many bottles as he could find, Peskin said. A total of 20 officers responded to the scene, where about 30 children were in attendance. CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.","Brawl breaks out at birthday party for toddler .

"(CNN) -- Eleven Somalis convicted of piracy-related crimes are heading to prison in the island nation of Seychelles, the archipelago's department of legal affairs said in a press release. The Seychelles' Supreme Court Monday convicted and sentenced eight of the Somalis for committing an act of piracy and the other three for aiding and abetting an act of piracy. Each of the 11 was sentenced to 10 years in prison, said the statement. The presiding judge of the Supreme Court acquitted the suspects on five other charges related to ""acts of terrorism."" On December 5 and 6, the pirates -- who were in two small boats -- attacked the Seychelles coast guard vessel Topaz with automatic weapons. ""The aiders and abettors were found in a mother skiff not very far from the attack,"" said the statement. ""Evidence has revealed that the mother skiff had provided ammunitions and firearms to the two attack skiffs before they effected the attack."" The international piracy cases are the first to be prosecuted in the Seychelles. The department of legal affairs said the convictions ""will serve as a deterrent for prospective Somali pirates who would otherwise have thought that they would have come into Seychelles waters with impunity.""

"(CNN) -- ""The moment I got into the modeling industry, I knew I had to be an entrepreneur,"" says former supermodel Iman. One of the most recognized models of the 1970s and '80s, Iman has used her entrepreneurial skills to great effect in the fashion industry, with her own cosmetics business and in her charitable fund-raising work. Married to rock star David Bowie and now residing in New York, Iman was born in Somalia in 1955. Her father was an ambassador, but her comfortable upbringing was disrupted in 1969 with the assassination of Somalia's president, forcing her and her family to flee to Kenya. ""We left Somalia with nothing but the clothes on our back. Not even photographs, nothing. So it's a total loss of everything and a total loss of your own self, your own country, your own place in terms of your people. If you're lucky you're in a country that will give you a second chance,"" she told CNN. She was lucky and her adopted home of Kenya provided her with a scholarship at Nairobi University, and it was also in the Kenyan capital that she was discovered as a model. Stopped on a Nairobi street by fashion photographer Peter Beard, she was soon signed by a top model agency and moved to New York in 1975. With her exotic looks she caused a stir in the fashion world, helped in part by a fanciful story about her background spread by Beard. ""They wanted to believe because it's kind of like 'My Fair Lady'. Everything about that article was fabricated... I was discovered herding goats and discovered in the jungle; I've never seen the jungle in my life. I was a city girl,"" she said. Iman admits she was complicit in the fabrication, suggesting an early realization that the fashion industry was built around control and manipulation. ""I had to be very clever about not over exposing myself, not under exposing myself. I had to make sure that I knew my worth that I would not settle if they gave me less. I knew how to walk away. It's very key."" After facing numerous challenges being a black model, she launched Iman Cosmetics in 1994, designed for models no matter the color of their skin. A hugely successful catwalk career as a model ended in 1989, but she faced up to the transitory nature of her career and gained a greater sense of self long before that when she was injured in a car accident in 1983. ""Where everything was about what you do and about how you look, it changed to more security about me. It was not about 'how will I look ten years from now?' It all became about what kind of person would I be ten years from now. ""Because of it I became very comfortable in my own skin. In a weird way I didn't think about outward looks anymore,"" she said.","Former supermodel Iman now has own multi-million dollar cosmetics business .

"(CNN) -- French air traffic controllers went on strike Tuesday as labor unrest continued to roll across Europe despite the suspension of a strike by Lufthansa pilots after just one day. Half of Tuesday's flights at Orly Airport in Paris, France, were canceled, along with 25 percent of flights at Charles de Gaulle Airport, as a result of a planned strike by four civil aircraft staff, including air traffic controllers, for Tuesday through Saturday. Authorities at French airports advised passengers to check with their airlines before traveling to airports. The action comes a day after German-based Lufthansa and its pilots' union agreed to suspend its standoff and return to the bargaining table. The suspension will expire on March 8, barring an agreement before then, both sides said in a Frankfurt labor court. Also on Monday, British Airways cabin crew voted to strike, although no dates were announced. A planned 12-day walkout by Unite, the union which represents the workers, during the Christmas holidays was blocked by a judge. Are you fed up with all the strikes? Unite said it is continuing negotiations with the airline. Like Lufthansa pilots, British Airways staff are concerned about wages and job security as larger, older airlines deal with the twin blows of the global recession and increased competition from low-cost carriers. ""These are not mindless militants looking to bring the company down, these are ordinary, decent people who do a highly professional job, and very evidently they have a deep set of grievances,"" Len McCluskey, assistant general secretary of Unite told CNN. ""We accept that change is needed and we accept that British Airways is in serious financial trouble ... the problem we've got is British Airways decided to impose change instead of doing it through negotiations."" Airline industry: Strike, strike, everywhere a strike . European airlines were not the only ones hurting. Japan Airlines de-listed its shares from trading in Tokyo Saturday as part of its bankruptcy restructuring. And in Australia, Qantas Airlines announced this week it would eliminate first class travel from its flights. Industry watchers expect to see more industrial actions at airlines across the world. ""The [airline] industry is going to be losing approximately $10 billion for 2009, and projected to be over $5 billion in 2010, so you're going to see a lot more of these kinds of issues crop up as airlines try to cut costs in the face of all these losses,"" said Rick Seaney, CEO of Farecompare.com. ""Airlines used to be able to fly with planes a quarter empty, now they have to fill them to capacity, which is causing all kinds of consumer issues as well, which hurts their brand and hurts the industry overall,"" Seaney said. Beyond the airline industry, other labor disputes are spilling into industrial action in Europe. French gas giant Total said about 100 of 4,000 gas stations in the country are beginning to run out of fuel as a strike by oil refinery workers enters a second week. And in Spain, trade unions protested on Wednesday in Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia against a government plan to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67. It was the first major protest by the unions against Socialist Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero since he took office six years ago. Spain is the only major industrial economy still in recession and has one of the European Union's highest unemployment rates, of 19 percent. For workers under 25, the jobless rate is 40 percent, the government reports. The government plan to raise the retirement age to 67 aims to prevent, in the coming decades, the pension system from going bust, as Spaniards live longer and collect retirement benefits for longer periods, with a project declining number of workers paying in to the social security system, government officials have said publicly in recent weeks. Widespread strikes are also expected in Greece Wednesday over austerity measures the government plans to implement to cut its large public debt, which has caused stock market jitters and concerns that sovereign debt problems will spill across the world. CNN's Al Goodman contributed to this report.","French air traffic controllers go on strike Tuesday .

"(CNN Student News) -- September 22, 2010 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Afghanistan • Washington, D.C. • Orange Beach, Alabama . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Hi, I'm Carl Azuz, and welcome to this Wednesday edition of CNN Student News. We ask you guys a lot for your opinions on our blog. Today, we're gonna share some of what you've had to say and ask for your thoughts on another story we've covering. First Up: War in Afghanistan . AZUZ: Well, first up today, we're going to Afghanistan. U.S. and coalition troops have been fighting in that country for nine years. They're battling the Taliban, the militant group that used to control Afghanistan and that refused to turn over Osama bin Laden after the 9/11 terror attacks on the United States. Right now, there are around 100,000 American forces in Afghanistan. And for them, living and operating in what can be a very violent setting, safety is no guarantee. A sad reminder of that fact yesterday, when a helicopter crash claimed the lives of nine U.S. troops. Officials are trying to figure out what happened. There were no reports of enemy fire when the helicopter went down. During this year, 2010, the coalition has suffered more losses than any other year since the troops arrived in Afghanistan in 2001. Medal of Honor . AZUZ: We want to tell you about another military operation now. This one took place in 1968, during the Vietnam War, in the southeast Asian country of Laos. A group of Americans was running a radar post on top of a mountain in Laos. The North Vietnamese attacked it, and nearly all of the Americans were killed or wounded, except for one: Air Force Chief Master Sergeant Richard Etchberger. He fought off the enemy, loaded the wounded men onto a rescue helicopter, and then climbed in. That is when a single bullet hit him, and Sergeant Etchberger died in the helicopter. He was recommended for the Medal of Honor, the military's highest award. But he didn't get it. You see, U.S. troops weren't supposed to be in Laos during the Vietnam War, so Etchberger's heroic act was a secret for decades. Not anymore. Yesterday, during a ceremony at the White House, President Obama presented the Medal of Honor to Master Sergeant Etchberger's family. The president said that the Medal of Honor pays tribute to Sergeant Etchberger's courage, and it reflects the gratitude of the entire country. What's The Word . APRIL WILLIAMS, CNN STUDENT NEWS: What's the Word? the study of traits that are passed down from one generation to the next . GENETICS . That's the word! Great Salmon Debate . AZUZ: Genetic engineering is when you use technology to take a trait from one thing and put it into something else. You might have seen that in a science fiction story somewhere. But could you see it on your dinner table? That is what the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration, is considering. The agency is deciding whether or not to approve genetically-engineered salmon as food. You can see the difference in it. The modified salmon is twice as big, and it'll get that big in half the time. The company that's making the modified fish says this could help make the fishing industry more efficient and help make more food. But one big question: Is it safe to eat? Some critics argue that there hasn't been enough testing to see how this kind of genetic engineering will affect people or the salmon's ecosystem. Blog Promo and Report . AZUZ: So, would you eat it? CNN.com took a vote on this: About 17 percent of readers said they'd eat genetically-modified salmon ""in a heartbeat."" Almost half of them said ""not on your life."" You can comment on our blog at CNNStudentNews.com. It's the same place where you're talking about the recession, which the National Bureau of Economic Research says has been officially over since June of '09. Here's what you say: No, the recession isn't over, according to 78 percent of you. Now, these numbers were yesterday when we recorded the show; they might've changed a bit. Fifteen percent of you think the recession is over. Seven percent say they don't know. Dolly says ""jobs aren't improving, and it seems like prices are getting higher in food, gas, insurance. If the recession were over, there'd be more people with jobs and not so many struggling."" Markus says in his community, ""there's always at least one house with a foreclosure sign in the front yard,"" and that before the recession, he ""didn't have a clue that foreclosure existed."" Saying the recession is over isn't accurate to Kenni, though that's what the economic studies say. Kenni would like to ""see more data behind the facts."" Some of you, like Mary, say things are getting better. She writes that ""jobs are bouncing back and doing well, and that with time, unemployment and home sales will improve."" But another student named Mary says the worst may be over, but she asks ""how many budget cuts have been made since June of 2009? We still have a long way to go,"" Mary writes. This Day In History .

What is Ray LaHood's job in the U.S. government? If you think you know it, then shout it out!

Secretary LaHood is in charge of the Transportation Department. That's your answer and that's your shoutout! Distracted Driving Summit . AZUZ: Part of Secretary LaHood's job is to make sure that the U.S. transportation system is fast, efficient and safe. That last part is what he's focusing on right now. Yesterday, Secretary LaHood kicked off a meeting about distracted driving. The meeting was in Washington, D.C., and this is an issue that we've talked a lot about; it's one that you've discussed on our blog. Last year, we asked if you think the government should ban texting while driving. Nearly 80 percent of you said yes. Well, more than half the states agree. Right now, it's illegal to text when you're behind the wheel in 30 states. The transportation department is looking for other ways to cut down on distracted driving. At this meeting yesterday, Secretary LaHood announced new rules banning train operators and some bus and truck drivers from texting on the job. After the Oil . AZUZ: Every year, people pitch in to help clean up Alabama's beaches. It's a project called the Alabama Coastal Cleanup. Usually, these volunteers are just picking up trash. This year, though, as you might guess, they have to deal with oil that has washed up on the beaches from the spill out in the Gulf of Mexico. It creates some challenges, and it creates some opportunities. Check this out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SPENCER RYAN, EXECECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, ALABAMA PALS: I think this year's been a little unusual year, with the oil spill and that type of thing, having to address those issues. APRIL BOONE, ORANGE BEACH, ALABAMA ZONE CAPTAIN: We do have an information sheet today that is about oil and what to do if they encounter it, which is basically to leave it alone. RYAN: This year, we are expecting probably the numbers to be a little bit down, especially as far as amount of litter picked up, because of BP's work, you know, cleaning the beaches for the last several months. MIKE FOSTER, VICE PRESIDENT, ORANGE BEACH, ALABAMA TOURISM: I think the people here have had a feeling of frustration, because there really wasn't anything that they could do. They couldn't do anything about the oil. They couldn't do anything about the tar balls. This is something that they can do to help us come back. LUCY ANN BUFFETT, OWNER, LULU'S HOMEPORT, GULF SHORES, ALABAMA: It was a really rough going, but we have come through it like we do. We're coastal people. We live in the hurricane corridor.You just get up and you deal with it. AMELIE MONTJOY, VICE PRESIDENT, THE OCEAN CONSERVANCY: It's particularly good to be here this year and to see the energy and momentum and dedication of the people in Alabama to ensure that their beaches are cleaner and more productive than ever before. FOSTER: People want us to be OK, and they want to hear somebody say it's OK, and we've had a lot of signs that are saying that. The fishing is now re-opened. MONTJOY: What's wonderful about having children participate in these cleanups is that they are our future. And it reminds us adults that we have a legacy to leave to them, an environmental legacy, because if what we have now is not protected, they and their children and grandchildren will never have the opportunity to enjoy it. (END VIDEO CLIP) Before We Go . AZUZ: Okay, finally, you know how your parents told you not to play with your food? They might make an exception for this art project. It's called canstruction, and it's on display at a mall in California. Each sculpture is made entirely out of canned goods. Creative and consumable. It's actually part of a fundraiser that's trying to fight hunger. After the exhibit ends, all the cans go to a local food bank. Goodbye . AZUZ: The goal of the project: to show that everyone can make a difference. You might've seen that coming. Either way, it's all for now. CNN Student News is back tomorrow.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Military Religious Freedom Foundation is fighting fire with new Qurans. The group, which is dedicated to protecting U.S. troops from religious intolerance in the military, is promising to buy one new Quran and donate it to the Afghan National Army for each Quran burned by a Florida minister this weekend. Mikey Weinstein said more than 100 of the active duty troops that he represents have called him wanting to do something about the threat by Pastor Terry Jones to burn at least 200 Qurans on the anniversary of the September 11th terrorist attacks. Weinstein told CNN his group will buy new Qurans and send to them Gen. David Patraeus, the commander of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, so the general can give them to the Afghan National Army. The troops who support Weinstein's move want to be able to tell Afghan elders who are concerned about Quran burning that there is a group in the United States that feels differently.","Active duty troops asked that something be done .

"(CNN) -- A Washington woman who admitted to throwing a corrosive liquid on her own face pleaded not guilty Wednesday to three counts of theft. Bethany Storro appeared at her arraignment in a Clark County court with a red, scarred face and her hair pulled back in a bun. Prosecutors said she made up a story that she was attacked on August 30 by an African-American woman, after which a California resident sent her money, and two businesses held fundraisers to contribute to her treatment. The theft counts stem from those donations. In Washington state, theft against a person acting as a good Samaritan is considered an aggravating circumstance. Two-and-a-half weeks after the incident, police announced the 28-year-old grocery store employee admitted doing the damage herself. They say Storro bought drain cleaner at a hardware store and applied it to her face with a towel in a park restroom. Michael Kite, a California resident, sent Storro $1,000 via a PayPal account. Anytime Fitness, a gym Storro belonged to, and a Safeway store, where Storro worked, both held fundraisers. Storro has spent about $1,500 of the nearly $28,000 donated to her, CNN affiliate KING reported, citing court documents. She bought a train ticket for her sister, went on a shopping spree at Target and took her parents out to dinner, KING said. Det. Wallis Stefan, the lead investigator in the case, said his initial interviews with Storro uncovered a number of inconsistencies -- including that the chemical burns on her face appeared to have been applied and not splashed. Further, he wrote, Stefan found no evidence in or around Storro's vehicle of an acid attack, and photographs of Storro's face did not match photos of other recorded acid attacks. Storro came clean, he said, when detectives arrived at her home on September 16 to serve a search warrant. Storro admitted buying drain cleaner at a hardware store and applying it to her face with a towel in a park restroom. ""Storro told me the reason she applied the caustic substance was to first, kill herself,"" Stefan wrote. ""Secondly, she stated, if that proved not to be fatal, then she could get her face redone."" Storro told him she ""thought there would be no evidence of me doing it to myself"" and that police ""would give up on trying to find the person and it would be done."" Stefan said Storro acknowledged her Miranda rights and waived them before giving him a 90-minute statement.","Bethany Storro faces three counts of theft .

"Des Moines, Iowa (CNN) -- President Barack Obama said Wednesday that China's currency is undervalued, resulting in a trade advantage for Chinese goods over American goods that contributes to the U.S. trade deficit. Responding to a question at a town hall-style meeting, Obama addressed one of the major current issues in relations between the world's two largest economies. ""The reason I'm pushing China about their currency is because their currency is undervalued,"" he said, adding that "" people generally think they are managing their currency in a way that makes our goods more expensive to sell there and their goods cheaper to sell here."" The resulting imbalance was a major factor contributing to the U.S. trade deficit, Obama said. Last week, Obama urged Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao to speed up the revaluation of the yuan currency, telling him in a two-hour meeting at the United Nations that the slow pace of reforms was affecting both the global and U.S. economies, a top U.S. aide said. The meeting on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly followed a speech by Wen the night before in which he told the business community in New York that China will continue reforming and opening its markets under a policy it started in 1978 by officially ending decades of isolation. However, demands by U.S. lawmakers that China revalue its currency by more than 20 percent would bankrupt Chinese companies and lead to ""major unrest"" in his country, Wen said in the speech. The U.S. House is considering a bill to allow the United States to retaliate against China's handling of its currency. Jeff Bader, Obama's special assistant and senior director for Asian affairs, said the president noted to Wen in their meeting last week ""that there had not been much movement since"" China said in June that it would implement a more liberal currency policy. Obama told Wen that the Chinese inaction ""had consequences for the global economy and the U.S. economy,"" according to Bader. Obama said the United States ""looked for a more rapid and significant revaluation in coming months,"" Bader said. Bader declined to characterize Wen's response to Obama, saying only that Wen ""did reiterate Chinese intention to continue with reform to their exchange system."" In remarks to reporters, Obama and Wen emphasized cooperation between their governments and the need for frank discussions on their differences. ""Obviously, we continue to have more work to do,"" Obama said. ""On the economic front, although the world economy is now growing again, I think it's going to be very important for us to have frank discussions and continue to do more work cooperatively in order to achieve the type of balance and sustained economic growth that is so important and that we both signed up for in the context of the G-20 framework."" Obama praised Wen for ""extraordinary openness and cooperation with us as we try to strengthen the relationship between our two countries, a relationship that is based on cooperation, on mutual interest, on mutual respect."" Wen noted that ""common interests far outweigh our differences"" and that despite ""disagreements of one kind or another between our two countries, the differences can be resolved."" CNN's Tom Cohen contributed to this story.","NEW: The U.S. House is considering a bill to allow trade retaliation .

"(CNN)  -- Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni slammed the pitch in Colombo after the second Test against hosts Sri Lanka petered out into a high-scoring draw Friday. India were hoping to hit back after losing the first match of the series, Mutiah Muralitharan's triumphant Test farewell, but were frustrated by batting-friendly conditions. Dhoni's team scored a massive 707 in reply to Sri Lanka's 642 for four wickets. Sri Lanka were 129 for three wickets in their second innings when play was called off an hour early with no chance of a positive result. Skipper Kumar Sangakkara was unbeaten on 42 and Thilan Samaraweera was on 10 as they steadied the ship after the early loss of wickets. ""This one was very unsporting, there was nothing in it for the bowlers,"" Dhoni told AFP after a total 1,478 runs were scored and only 17 wickets claimed over the five days. ""If there is nothing for fast bowlers in a wicket it should help spinners. This was just for batsmen,"" Dhoni added. ""The bowlers got spanked all around the park."" India's massive knock was highlighted by a double century from Test-leading run scorer Sachin Tendulkar, while debutant Suresh Raina made 120 and Dhoni 76. The 37-year-old Tendulkar shows no signs of easing up in his pursuit of yet more records. ""As long as you are mentally strong and prepared to go through the grind, age really does not really matter,"" he said. Sri Lanka will go into the final Test from next Tuesday with a 1-0 series lead after their thumping 10-wicket win in Galle where Muralitharan topped off his incredible career by reaching 800 Test wickets. In other Test cricket action Friday, James Anderson celebrated his 28th birthday with a superb five-wicket haul as Pakistan slumped to 147 for nine on the second day of the first Test against England at Trent Bridge. Anderson swung the ball in trademark fashion to finish with five wickets for 49 runs in 20 overs as Pakistan were left 207 adrift of England's first innings 354 when bad light forced an early close. Young paceman Steven Finn supported Anderson with three for 20 in 11 overs as Pakistan collapsed to 47 for six before Umar Gul's 30 not out at better than a run a ball took them to within eight runs of avoiding the follow-on. Earlier, England had lost their last six wickets for just 17 runs as Mohammad Asif took five wickets for Pakistan.","Second Test between Sri Lanka and India in Colombo ends in high-scoring draw .

"New York (CNN) -- Forget two turntables and a microphone -- New York City experienced two tornados  and a microburst Thursday, according to the National Weather  Service. Spokesman Gary Conte told reporters at the Office of Emergency Management late Friday.that an EF-0 tornado touched down in Brooklyn and an EF-1  tornado touched down in Queens. ""EF"" numbers -- the Enhanced Fujita scale -- are a method of estimating wind speed based on damage. An EF-0 tornado likely brought 3-second bursts of winds between 65 and 85 mph, while an EF-1 carried gusts of 86 to 110 mph. The strongest winds and  greatest damage, which also took place in Queens, were caused by what Conte  described as a ""microburst."" Conte said this was ""a sudden acceleration of winds  coming out from fast moving storms.""  It produced wind gusts up to 125 miles per  hour, he told reporters. National Weather Service meteorologist Ross Dickman told reporters that the service and emergency management and spent  the day reviewing radar data, interviewing residents, touring the ground and  flying around different parts of the city to determine the types of storms  that hit the area Thursday. ""I want to first say  that I'm very sorry for those that experienced extensive damage with this  storm,"" he said. Crews in New York worked  early Friday morning to clean up damage left behind by a  fast-moving storm that killed one person when it ripped through the city. The storm's strong winds and  torrential rains toppled trees and left more than 20,000 customers without power  Thursday. A 30-year-old woman was killed  in Queens when a tree fell on the car she was driving, the New York Police  Department said. ""The good news is that most  people were safe, just annoyed, traffic being bad or a tree coming down in their  yard,"" he said. Both New York City's La  Guardia and New Jersey's Newark airports experienced two-hour outbound delays  Thursday, while John F. Kennedy airport reported three-hour outbound delays. The storm also caused a  headache for commuters on Thursday.  All Long Island Railroad service going east  out of Manhattan was suspended Thursday after the storm,  as was service on certain subway lines running from Manhattan into Queens and Brooklyn.  . CNN's Sean Morris, Jesse Solomon, Logan Burruss, Rob Frehse, Cheryl Robinson, and Kristen Hamill and Eden Pontz contributed to this report.","NEW: Queens, Brooklyn took tornado hits .

"(CNN) -- Six people have died in an apparent murder-suicide in Riviera Beach, Florida, police said Monday. A police officer was investigating a suspicious car when he heard shots and saw a man walk out of a home shortly after 2 a.m. ET, according to a statement from the Riviera Beach Police Department. The man shot and killed himself when he spotted the officer, the statement said. Authorities identified him as Patrick Dell, 41. Inside the house, police found the bodies of the man's 36-year-old estranged wife, Natasha Whyte Dell, and four of his stepchildren, ranging in age from 10 to 14, the statement said. A fifth stepchild was hospitalized with a gunshot wound. Two biological children of Dell and his wife, believed to be 1 and 3, apparently were not hurt. The police statement says that they are being cared for by relatives. Investigators identified the children who were killed as Daniel Barnett, 10; Javon Nelson, 11; Diane Barnett, 13 and Bryan Barnett, 14. Grief counselors plan to go to the children's schools Monday, the police said. ""This is a sad day for Riviera Beach,"" Police Chief Clarence Williams said in the statement. ""Many families have been tragically impacted by this unfortunate incident. ""Had it not been for excellent police work, this suspect could have escaped the scene and possibly injured or killed other innocent victims."" Investigators believe ""Dell acted alone,"" the police statement said.","A woman and four of her children were shot to death in Florida .

"Editor's note: CNN.com has a business partnership with CareerBuilder.com, which serves as the exclusive provider of job listings and services to CNN.com. (CareerBuilder.com) -- Finding a career that allows you to travel is not always an easy task, but if you're a college grad looking to make an adventure of your gap year, a professional looking for a change of pace or anyone looking for cultural exposure, a job abroad may be the right choice for you. A tourist gets a traditional massage in Thailand. Not all jobs are translatable to international positions without a little extra learning or language proficiency -- and you will need to acquire working permits and other legal documentation -- but here are some jobs that can take you away if you're up for the move: . 1. Teacher  It's not news that teachers aren't highly paid, but if you're an instructor in South Dakota, you're among the lowest-paid in the nation, with an average salary of $33,236, according to a 2003-04 survey by the American Federation of Teachers. Try taking your skills abroad. Learning English is in high demand internationally, and Germany, Switzerland and South Korea are among the countries that pay the largest teacher salaries. South Korea's median teacher salaries range between $25,000 and $60,000, and the country has a positive reputation for providing high income to educators. Salaries in Switzerland range from $65,000 to $80,000. An added perk to employment in Germany is that state employees are regarded as permanent workers, meaning that they are paid necessary social insurances. Requirements: A four-year degree in education or a related field, teaching experience and a TESL/TEFL certificate. You will also need an international work visa and work permits, which can be obtained personally or through the school that employs you. 2. Chef If you are an established chef, international hotels and restaurants may offer the opportunity to build on your career overseas while, in many cases, offering you room and board for a minimum costs. In the United States, the median annual income of a head chef/chef is $40,000, and $43,000 if you work as a chef for a hotel. Kingsbrook USA Inc. is one company that works to place chefs in international regions. They reported England's hotel chef positions as offering £14000, or roughly $26,730 U.S. dollars per year for Chef deParties. Kingsbrook also reported between $32,458 and $38,186 per year for Sous Chefs and between $38,186 and $47,732 per year for Head Chef. Requirements: An associate degree and at least three years of culinary experience. Letters of Reference, transcripts and health records and exams will also be required. 3. Massage therapist Massage therapists in the United States make a median annual salary of $30,000. But take your expertise to the seas, and you could earn between $33,600 and $45,600, according to Cruise Job Line. In addition to changing stationary surroundings, working on cruise lines offers the opportunity to see new people and network beyond the limitations that can be created in a spa environment. The living accommodations may be small, but they save money on housing costs, and cruise lines usually offer full health coverage onboard the ship and within United States territory. Requirements: You'll need a high school diploma or associate degree, and a certification in massage therapy. Requirements for accreditation vary by state. U.S. citizens pursuing massage therapy for cruise lines also need a passport that is valid for at least three months after the end of the contract. A physical examination, and in some cases, immunization may be required. 4. Au Pair/Nanny In exchange for caring for your boss' children and caring out light housekeeping or cooking duties, au pair positions offer a chance to travel abroad with room and board and a living stipend. The job will enable access that tourists are not privy to, but the work shouldn't be taken lightly. The median annual income for company-employed nannies is $29,500 in the United States. An au pair in France can expect to earn between 240 and 250 euro, or an estimated $309 to $322 per month for a 33-hour week. The pay varies internationally, but the overall perk is the opportunity to afford to see another part of the world. Requirements: A passport, work visa and an international driver's license. You will also need to acquire medical insurance and undergo health screenings. Agency placement is a better choice for acquiring an au pair position for both safety reasons and to aid with acquiring your work permit. While au pair experience is not necessary, most au pairs have held related positions. 5. Caterer Catering managers make an average median salary of $35,590 in the United States, and while other countries offer this position, the commute from national to international can literally be a matter of taste. Caterers who create a name for themselves in the U.S. industry can earn a trusted reputation and follow clients to overseas events. Rock stars and celebrities may have a variety of different catering companies working for them throughout the United States, but larger acts and A-listers like to have a trusted source to make sure their diet is in line with their requests. Working for one of these companies may put you on tour with the band, and if national gigs go well, you could find yourself overseas for the next tour. Requirements: Chefs and management have culinary training, but staff servers may have little or no experience. To garner a spot on a worldwide tour, a caterer will generally have a lot of experience. Passports are needed for international work. E-mail to a friend . Copyright CareerBuilder.com 2007. All rights reserved.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- The executive director of the organization sending a Libyan-backed ship laden with humanitarian goods to Gaza -- in violation of an Israeli blockade -- said Tuesday that the ship's captain has no plans to alter course. ""We confirm that the ship is definitely heading to Gaza; we have no other destination other than Gaza,"" Gadhafi International Charity and Development Foundation's Yusuf Sawani told CNNI in a telephone interview from Tripoli, Libya. ""This is where we think humanitarian assistance and relief material should go."" Sawani said he was speaking hourly with those aboard the ship, which was located some 60 to 70 km (37 to 43 miles) from Gaza. It was due to arrive at the Palestinian territory about 10 a.m. Wednesday, he said. The Israeli navy has approached the vessel and given the chief of mission and the ship's captain an ultimatum: Divert to the Egyptian port of al-Arish, he said. ""But our answer will remain as always,"" he said. ""We started sailing toward Gaza and Gaza is our target, and we hope that every party concerned will come to their senses and  realize that this is a humanitarian, peaceful mission."" He added, ""This is not a propaganda stunt."" Sawani said Sunday that the activists on the boat would not resist if confronted by the Israeli military. Earlier Tuesday, an Israeli official with knowledge of the communications between the Israeli military and the vessel said the ship's captain had agreed to change course and go to Egypt instead. An Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hossam Zaki, said Egypt is prepared to grant the Libyan ship docking rights. ""We haven't received an official request yet but if we do we will grant permission,"" Zaki said. The Israel Defense Forces had said its navy earlier was making ""preparations to stop"" the ship from delivering aid directly to Gaza, in violation of an Israeli blockade. The IDF asked the ship to change course for the Egyptian port of al-Arish, a military spokesman told CNN, adding that the military had not intercepted or boarded the ship. Israel came under fierce international criticism for killing nine Turkish activists in the course of boarding a Gaza-bound ship in May. Israel said the activists attacked its troops when they boarded the boat. The new aid ship was launched by a charity headed by the son of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. It set sail from Greece on Saturday carrying 2,000 tons of aid. Israel says it must inspect all goods that enter Gaza so that weapons do not get into the hands of militants. Gaza is run by Hamas, a Palestinian Islamist movement. The Gadhafi Foundation refers to the ship as the Hope, although it appears to be registered as the MV Amalthea. It is Moldovan-flagged and run by ACA Shipping, based in Greece. Sawani said thatin addition to the crew members, nine others were on board: Six Libyans, one Moroccan and one person from Niger, all of whom work with the Gadhafi Foundation, plus a journalist from the Al Jazeera network. Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak Sunday called the ship ""an unnecessary provocation."" Barak said Israel would not allow the aid ship to dock in Gaza, but said it could unload goods elsewhere and Israel would allow them to enter the Palestinian territory by land after Israel inspects them. ""Goods can be transferred into Gaza through the port of Ashdod after they are inspected, but we will not allow the transfer of weapons or ammunition into Gaza,"" he said. ""We recommend to the organizers ... to allow navy vessels to escort it to the port of Ashdod or sail directly to al-Arish"" in Egypt. A report Monday on the findings of an Israeli military investigation into the boarding of the Turkish ship Mavi Marmara in May, in which nine people were killed, criticized some aspects of the operation. The operation prepared only one course of action and had no backup plan, military commanders were not presented with options other than boarding the ship, and different branches of military intelligence did not coordinate well enough, the report found. But the report said the commando team that boarded the ship operated properly, with bravery and professionalism, and that the use of live fire was justified. Israel has resisted demands for an international inquiry into the incident. Meanwhile, upheaval continued in Gaza on Tuesday evening, when the Israeli military fired at least one shell into a house in Gaza, Palestinian security and medics said. The dead included a woman and the injured included two women and two children from the the Al-Bureij neighborhood  in central Gaza, medics said. An IDF spokesman said its forces identified suspected militants along a security fence and fired on them; reports of casualties were under investigation. CNN's Izzy Lemberg and Talal Abu-Rahma and Paul Colsey contributed to this report.","Gadhafi charity's executive director says the ship is bound for Gaza .

"(CNN Student News) -- November 9, 2009 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Fort Hood, Texas  • Berlin, Germany . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: From D.C. to Texas to Berlin, CNN Student News brings you stories from around the globe. Kicking off a new week of commercial-free headlines, I'm Carl Azuz. First Up: House Passes Bill . AZUZ: First up, a health care reform bill passes in the U.S. House of Representatives. Saturday's vote was a close one, though: 220 for, 215 against, with 39 Democrats voting against the bill and one Republican voting for it. Democrats claimed the vote as a victory, and one lawmaker said it's their responsibility to pass health care reform. REP. G.K. BUTTERFIELD, (D) NORTH CAROLINA: We have an obligation, constitutional and moral, to provide for the general welfare of every American citizen. Allowing a broken health care system to continue to bankrupt families, businesses and hospitals and deny coverage to millions is a failure of duty. We must act now. AZUZ: A lot of people agree that the country's health care system is broken. But one Republican congressman says that the House Democrats' plan to fix it is the wrong approach. REP. JACK KINGSTON, (R) GEORGIA: If your kitchen sink is leaking, you fix the sink. You don't take a wrecking ball to the entire kitchen. This bill is a wrecking ball to the entire economy. AZUZ: So, what's next? The Senate has to vote on its health care bill. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says that might not happen before the end of the year as President Obama wanted it to. Now, if the Senate passes a bill, it and the House versions would have to be combined into a new single bill, and then that would have to be passed by both houses of Congress. If all that happens, then President Obama would have to sign the final bill for it to become law. A long way to go, and a lot of ""if's"" along the way. Unemployment Up . AZUZ: Turning to the economy, the new numbers are out on the nationwide unemployment rate, and they're not good: 10.2 percent. That's up from 9.8 percent last month, and it's the first time since 1983 that the country's unemployment rate has been in double digits. The news isn't good for you guys, either I'm sorry to say. Teen unemployment, which covers 16 to 19 year olds, now stands at 27.6 percent. Part of the reason for that is because teens are having to compete for jobs against adults who are out of work. The government is trying to help out. Last week, President Obama signed a new law that extends the amount of time that people can collect unemployment benefits. Spoken Word . GOV. RICK PERRY, TEXAS: In the days to come, our priorities are gonna be simple: support the families of those affected by this violence, support the criminal investigation that is ongoing, continue supporting our military as we always have. Fort Hood Update . AZUZ: That was Texas Governor Rick Perry, speaking in the wake of last week's tragic shooting at Fort Hood. Authorities still don't know what prompted the attack there last Thursday killing 13 people, wounding more than 40 others. The suspected gunman, who's an Army major, was shot himself several times during the attack. He survived. Police are asking anyone who was there to step forward. They think people who ran away during the shooting might have evidence that could help the investigation. Fort Hood has a processing center where soldiers go before heading off to war. Nearby churches are offering help, services and prayers for anyone affected by the shooting. Is this Legit . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN: Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall! JONES: Is this legit? In that famous speech, President Ronald Reagan was talking about the Great Wall of China. False! In the 1987 address, President Reagan was referring to the Berlin Wall. Wall Museum . AZUZ: Twenty years ago today, the Berlin Wall did come down, and with it, the division of Germany into east and west. On last Tuesday's show, Fred Pleitgen looked at the remains of the wall itself. Today, Jim Clancy visits Checkpoint Charlie, a main crossing spot when the wall was standing, and a museum dedicated to the people who tried to escape from behind it. (BEGIN VIDEO) JIM CLANCY, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: The Wall Museum at Checkpoint Charlie. It chronicles the fear and suffering, ingenuity and heroism of a generation who refused to be sealed off from the free world. ALEXANDRA HILDEBRANDT, BERLIN WALL MUSEUM CURATOR: It was very, very, very dangerous because the people, they just want to be free. CLANCY: A car seemingly too tiny to smuggle humans to freedom did exactly that. And there's the gas tank that hid a child brought in from the cold. An ultralight aircraft used by a Czech student in a flight from communism. And there were tunnels, too. HILDEBRANDT: Here you see tunnel 57; means 57 people could come through. It was about 700 tunnels the people did try to build, but very few were successful. CLANCY: Alexandra Hildebrandt keeps alive the enthusiasm her late husband, Rainer, felt when he opened the Wall Museum. He started building it as soon as the Soviet Union and its allies put up the wall. She estimates 900,000 people come each year to share that. Some are German students who learn from their guides about a daring balloon journey that brought entire families safely to the West. Others are visitors to Berlin, enthralled by the sheer boldness, desperation and drive of those who risked all for freedom. HILDEBRANDT: Our museum tells people how important to be free. Our museum tells people how many people died that we are, today, can live in freedom. CLANCY: Like no other place in the world, the Wall Museum shows visitors the actual signposts of the Cold War. It even presents artifacts dug up from the street below after the fall of the wall. HILDEBRANDT: And this is original borderline here from Checkpoint Charlie. This is the borderline where President Reagan in 1982 stayed and made just one step over to show he do not want any more to have this border here. CLANCY: For all the tactics and tricks on display, Berlin's famous Wall Museum pays homage to the pain and suffering of those captured or shot down and left to die slowly just a few steps from freedom. It reminds us, past or present, freedom has its price. (END VIDEO) Horses for Heroes . AZUZ: For some U.S. troops who are wounded while serving overseas, coming back home can be challenging, both physically and emotionally. There's a program that aims to aid in the recovery process by offering some helping hooves. Photojournalist Eddie Cortes gives us a look. (BEGIN VIDEO) JUSTIN RICHARDSON, U.S. MARINE CORPS VETERAN: Gideon, come here, boy. I actually swore in on September 11, 2001. And then the first plane hit the Trade Tower. I was a squad leader during Operation Phantom Fury out in Anbar Province. LESLIE OLSON, THERAPEUTIC RIDING INSTRUCTOR, CHASTAIN HORSE PARK: The Horses for Heroes program is a program for the wounded troops, no matter what branch of the service they're in. So, they come out and they work with the horses. It's not just about the riding. RICHARDSON: It's a really cool feeling to, you know, be next to an animal this big that can do some serious damage if he wanted to. But really, they're just big babies that love rubdowns. OLSON: He's really bonded with Gideon. He's a kind of a guy's kind of horse: loves to be groomed and he stands patiently. RICHARDSON: During combat operations, I was at the wrong place at the wrong time, ended up taking some shrapnel. BETSY SMITH, REHABILITATION COUNSELOR, SHEPHERD SPINAL CENTER: Justin is doing much better. He came to us with some difficulties. RICHARDSON: I had sustained a brain injury and had post traumatic stress disorder. SMITH: We've really been able to use the Horses for Heroes program to work on his anxiety. RICHARDSON: I've never really been around horses; I'm actually from the city. Closest thing to a horse I had was a 100-pound rottweiler. OLSON: There are many that don't want to come and ride, but they want to work hands-on with the horses. RICHARDSON: It's kind of a trust thing, you know? He trusts you, you trust him. OLSON: If their back hurts or if they just don't feel like riding, we always have something for them to do. RICHARDSON: You know, it's been extremely therapeutic, especially emotionally. OLSON: They love coming out and working with the horses. That gives them a sense of accomplishment when they're done. It's been a wonderful program. It's something I can give to these men and women who have come back and have done so much for us. We can help them heal. (END VIDEO) Promo . AZUZ: Great story.

"(CNN) -- I lived through 9/11. Now I live two blocks from ground zero. This Sunday, I walked over to view two competing rallies - pro and con - over the Islamic cultural center (with mosque) that is to be built on Park Place, near the site of the former World Trade Center. The rally against the center was predictably more crowded. Perhaps 2,000 people clustered on West Broadway -- off-duty firefighters, construction workers and family members of the fallen from 9/11 -- all watched over by New York City's finest. The cranes of ground zero were visible in the background. Looking at the signs and talking with the people, it soon became clear that the battle over the center has become a proxy war for other issues. It is a powerful magnet for passionate feeling in a combustible political environment. Many signs warned about sharia law, as if the center represents a first step toward the unconstitutional imposition of Islam's religious principles on Americans. At the side of the speaker's stage, two mock missiles had slogans painted on their side referring to Iran's pursuit of a nuclear weapon. Beneath one of the ""missiles"" was written ""Obama: With a middle name is Hussain (sic). We understand. Bloomberg: What is your excuse?"" (Mayor Michael Bloomberg has strongly supported the building of the Islamic center.) And there were flashes of wing-nuttery. A man in a Confederate flag shirt and a cowboy hat held a sign that read ""I'm afraid the Mosquerade has ended."" A man in a plastic Obama mask with devil's horns affixed to its side held a sign saying ""Evil Mosque."" For some folks, the Islamic center near ground zero has become a metaphor for what they fear Obama wants to do to the nation. This helps to explain the troubling rise in the number of people who believe fear-mongering emails that claim that the president is Muslim or not born in the nation. But the vast majority of the signs I saw were sobering: ""It's Not About Freedom of Religion, its about Respect for the (3000) Dead;"" ""The mosque is salt in the wound of 9/11;"" ""It's my first amendment right to protest this travesty...just because you have the right doesn't mean you should."" These are not signs of so-called ""Islamophobia,"" let alone hatred of all Muslims, as the wife of the Imam, Daisy Kahn, sweepingly asserted this week. They are instead common sense and easily anticipated concerns in a community that lost so many lives to Islamist (not Islamic) terrorism less than a decade ago. If the goal of the center is really to promote healing, the reaction so far is evidence of failure. A genuinely inter-faith center on that site would better accomplish those aims. The counter protest was pitifully small by comparison; a few dozen people, no stage set or amplifiers, signs with earnest slogans like ""grief is no excuse for bigotry or war"" or self-righteous non-sequiturs like ""America, when did it become O.K to be a bigot and a racist again."" Conflict between the two protests was kept to a minimum by the police, but there were angry debates and heated exchanges. One man walked by the center protestors and said ""die peacefully."" He said his name was Al. I asked Al what he meant by that. He backed away and said that he hoped the protestors would find peace before the hereafter. ""This has nothing to do with the mosque. They are just racist haters. That's not the America we know. I've been living here 40 years."" He pointed to a 10-year old boy in a red baseball cap, who I assumed was his grandson. ""His father is a United States Marine. Where are we going to go? This is our country....They have opinions, that's fine. But don't hate Islam. Those who did wrong, they should be punished. But the same thing is true for the group in the White House that killed 1.5 million Iraqis. They should be punished."" ""Are you comparing President Bush to terrorists?,"" I asked. ""Oh, absolutely,"" he said. ""Look at what happened in Abu Ghraib. You think Muslims are going to forget that?"" The truth is rarely pure and never simple. Attempts to paint all opponents of the center's location as bigots are wrong. Attacks on the center's organizers as a fifth column flank for Osama bin Laden are ignorant. The majority of people I spoke to seemed clear on the constitutional right to build an Islamic cultural center/mosque, as President Obama asserted. The real issue is what the president later called ""the wisdom"" of the site's selection. The fact of this debate -- however messy -- is evidence of America's freedom and pluralism. We are debating whether or not we should override our own sensitivities in an attempt to teach the world a larger lesson, or whether our openness is being exploited by people who would undo it. The stakes are heightened because we are engaged in a non-optional war against Islamist terrorism. But as President Bush and President Obama have repeatedly emphasized, our enemy is most assuredly not Islam as a whole. People who are trying to exploit this debate for political gain are playing a dangerous game. America is great because we are good, and the example of our magnificent pluralism is the ultimate repudiation of the intolerance of extremists and fundamentalists. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","John Avlon went to protests over Islamic center, says it's become proxy for other issues .
Protesters held inflammatory signs, he says, some from right-wing extreme .
But some protesters earnestly opposed, others just conflicted, he says .

"(CNN) -- Nigeria will not fall into violence over his decision to stand for elections next year, President Goodluck Jonathan said in an exclusive interview with CNN. ""I can tell you very clearly that violence will not break out because of my interests. I can tell you very clearly,"" Jonathan said in a wide-ranging interview at the presidential palace in Abuja ahead of October 1 celebrations marking 50 years of independence. Read a transcript of the interview . In September, Jonathan declared his intention to run in the October presidential primaries for his party, the People's Democratic Party. Under Nigerian ""zoning"" rules, power must rotate between the north and the south every eight years. Jonathan -- a native of the Niger Delta region in the south -- was vice president under President Umaru Yar'Adua, from the north, when he died in May three years into his first term. ""In the first place if this country had agreed the presidency rotates between north and south I would not be the president today. I couldn't have been if there is an agreement in this country that it rotates between north and south,"" Goodluck reasoned. ""I couldn't have been the president the day Yar'Adua died -- another northerner would have taken over and I could have continued as the vice president. Goodluck acknowledged that Nigeria is grappling with limited resources, corruption and high poverty, despite being a world leader in oil production. However, he said, ""one thing that I know and I feel Nigeria will celebrate is continuity and peace. Yes we experienced civil war that lasted 13 months. Some other countries experienced civil wars that lasted for years.""","Jonathan intends to run in the October presidential primaries for PDP .

"(RollingStone.com) -- Jon Stewart says that his Rally to Restore Sanity -- and Stephen Colbert's sister event, March to Keep Fear Alive -- are not meant to counter Glenn Beck's Restoring Honor event of last August. ""The march is like everything that we do, just a construct ... to translate the type of material that Stephen and I do on ""The Daily Show"" and ""Colbert Report,"" Stewart said at a Q&A last night at New York's 92nd Street Y. Instead, the rallies are meant to satirize the political process, and the news coverage spawned from it. ""I'm less upset about politicians than the media,"" Stewart, who was quoted by The Hollywood Reporter, said, adding that he ""very much"" wanted to avoid claims that his rally was a response to Beck's. Obama in command: The Rolling Stone interview . The Rally to Restore Sanity and March to Keep Fear Alive will take place in Washington, D.C. on October 30th. (Halloween costumes will likely be involved.) ""Think of our event as Woodstock, but with the nudity and drugs replaced by respectful disagreement; the Million Man March, only a lot smaller, and a bit less of a sausage fest; or the Gathering of the Juggalos, but instead of throwing our feces at Tila Tequila, we'll be actively not throwing our feces at Tila Tequila,"" goes a description on the Rally to Restore Sanity site. Matt Taibbi: The truth about the Tea Party . Conservative host Bill O'Reilly has declined Stewart's invitation to appear at his rally. President Barack Obama, meanwhile, said he was ""amused"" by the idea. Speaking to students yesterday about how the media has become ""very splintered,"" with extreme tones from both conservative and liberal commentators, Obama said, ""Jon Stewart, the host of ""The Daily Show,"" apparently he is going to host a rally called something like Americans in Favor of a Return to Sanity or something like that. And his point was, you know, seventy percent of the people, it doesn't matter what their political affiliation are, seventy percent of the folks are just like you, which is they're going about their business, they're working hard every day, they're looking after their families.""

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- The Greek capital was tense Thursday after the government ordered truck drivers back to work following a three-day strike. Striking workers threw rocks and plastic bottles at the gates of the transport ministry in the morning, and police used tear gas to disperse the angry crowd. The strike has caused gas stations in Athens to run out of fuel, stranding people around the country just as many Greeks leave for August vacation. Bookings by tourists from neighboring countries were also ""frozen"" because of the strike, the head of the Hellenic Hotels Federation, Andreas Andreadis, said in a television interview Thursday. Thousands of tourists from Russia, Bulgaria, and Serbia, who are traveling by car, remain stranded in northern Greece because of the strike, Andreadis said. See iReport video of trucks blocking highway traffic . Many gas stations have signs saying they are out of fuel, and there are long lines at those stations that still have supplies. The government issued a rare emergency order to the owners and drivers of the trucks to return to work Thursday, saying they face severe penalties -- including having their licenses revoked -- if they don't. Greece has about 33,000 licensed truck drivers. They went on strike this week to protest government plans to open up their industry and issue new licenses. The government is required to make the changes under the terms of loan packages from the European Union and International Monetary Fund.

The subsequent shrieking was likely the loudest ever for a Broadway stand-in. Green Day's buildup to the 'breakdown': A look back at the punk trio's career . It was an impressive Broadway debut for the Green Day frontman, whose character is an evil influence on the punky protagonist Jesus of Suburbia (played by John Gallagher Jr.) It was also a rare opportunity to see Armstrong in the role: He is filling in for Broadway vet Tony Vincent (who is on short leave for a family matter) for eight performances, the last one of which happens Sunday night. His lines were few, but the 38-year-old fell naturally into the flow of the choreography, and of course, he gave inimitable, passionate performances of his own songs (""Homecoming,"" ""She's a Rebel,"" ""Last Night on Earth,"" and ""Know Your Enemy."") 'American Idiot' musical: Meet the show's rocker cast . Armstrong appeared 30 minutes into the show, atop a moving staircase, where he howled the ""1-2-3-4"" count-off during ""St. Jimmy."" The applause was deafening as he sang the first lines: He strutted down the stairs, grabbed his crotch during the thrashing breakdown, and joined the rest of the cast in their choreographed moves, shooting them up with heroin. As the track's final note was struck, he grasped hands with Gallagher, and remained in the position for a full minute, to huge applause. Video: Green Day on 'American Idiot' ""It turns out he's a really good actor,"" Michael Alden, a fan in his early twenties, told Rolling Stone after the show. ""He actually danced. There was choreography, and I believed his character."" Since the musical (which is based on the 2004 Green Day album of the same name, which itself sold five million copies and won a Grammy for Best Rock Album) debuted in April, Billie Joe has promoted it tirelessly, once surprising the audience with a short Green Day set, performing with the cast on Monday Night Football and appearing on local New York television. ""These people were on a stage singing my songs -- it was kind of like being invited to your own funeral,"" Armstrong told ""Rolling Stone"" after witnessing the play last spring. ""It blew me away."" Peter Travers reviews 'American Idiot' Playing St. Jimmy amounts to Armstrong's biggest show of support yet for the show, which last week played to half-full houses. (Last night appeared to be sold out.) He was respectful of the role, and seemingly intent on not overshadowing the cast -- he never broke character or sang numbers outside of his role. Still, he brought 20 years of stage experience to the role. He stood on a television during ""Know Your Enemy,"" making his trademark bug eyes and pantomiming a gun to his head, and ripped off his shirt during ""The Death of St. Jimmy"" (revealing plenty of chest tattoos) as the cast crowded around him until he fell backward into their arms. After the full-cast bow (Armstrong didn't take his own), the curtain reopened while the full cast held acoustic guitars. Armstrong picked the opening notes to for ""Good Riddance (Time of Your Life),"" taking the full first verse -- typically, the cast trades lines -- then left rest of them to the actors. Afterwards, the audience spilled onto 44th Street and a massive mob waited for Armstrong to emerge (he eventually did, but went straight to his car.) ""It was surreal to see [Armstrong] singing what he wrote up close and personal,"" 19-year-old Natalie Kolbo said outside. ""From the first moment he was there, I was in awe.""

"(CNN) -- Argentina's Juan Martin Del Potro made a disappointing comeback from injury at the Thailand Open in Bangkok on Tuesday, where he was defeated 7-6 6-4 by Olivier Rochus of Belgium in the opening round. The 22-year-old has not played on the ATP Tour since losing in the fourth round of the Australian Open in January, after sustaining a wrist injury which has seen the former world number four slip to 36 in the world rankings. But despite serving 16 aces during the match, the 2009 U.S. Open champion's return to the game was cut short by world number 78 Rochus in just under two hours. A foot shorter than his two-meter, Rochus came through a close first set and a break down in the second to book his place in the second round of south-east Asian tournament where he will play Kazakhstani Mikhail Kukushkin. After the match fifth seed Del Potro was full of praise for his victor and said he was just happy to be playing again despite the loss. ""I played a good match,"" Del Potro told the official ATP website. ""I had my chances in the first-set tie-break and he played some great points. He served very good, which was important on this kind of surface. He played very well today. ""I'm just happy to be back on the circuit and I hope I get better and better."" The result opens up the draw for world number one Rafael Nadal, who would have faced Del Potro in the quarterfinal. The Spaniard will be playing in the tournament for the first time, after arriving in the Thai capital on Tuesday. The newly crowned U.S. Open champion will face Belgian qualifier Ruben Bemelmans in a second round match on Wednesday. Meanwhile in Tuesday's other first round matches, Germany's Rainer Schuttler defeated Brazil's Ricardo Mello, Guillermo Garcia-Lopez of Spain beat German Michael Berrer, and world number 13 Jarkko Nieminen saw off home favorite Danai Udomchoke.","Juan Martin Del Potro loses on comeback to tennis after wrist injury .

"Paris, France (CNN) -- A woman has been charged over the discovery of the bodies of eight newborn babies at two locations in northern France, the French Interior Ministry said Thursday. Gendarmes found the remains in the village of Villers-au-Tertre, south of Lille, some in a home and others in the garden of another home. The woman has admitted giving birth to and killing the babies and has been charged with voluntary manslaughter, prosecutor Eric Vaillant said. But her husband has not been charged after telling investigators he knew nothing of the pregnancies and deaths, he said. The couple are in their mid-forties. The woman is a nursing assistant while her husband is a member of the local council, a neighbor told AFP. ""These are attractive, helpful, polite and courteous people, who did nothing to make you think them capable of anything abnormal,"" he said. Another resident said the couple had two grown-up daughters and were grandparents, AFP said. The pair had lived in the village for at least 15 years, neighbors said. Former mayor Daniel Collignon said Villers-au-Tertre was a quiet, rural community. ""I'm still in shock,"" he told AFP. Police said a man digging in his backyard found the remains of two newborn children and called police. The man said he bought the home from another couple who live a few minutes' drive away. When police searched the couple's home with sniffer dogs they found the bodies of six infants, they said. Psychotherapist Lucy Beresford told CNN that very little was known about the circumstances of infanticide because it was a taboo subject. Research suggested that women who denied or concealed their pregnancies, for whatever reason, were a ""high-risk"" group, she said. But other factors could trigger infanticide as well. ""It could actually be to do with the social isolation of the mother, or it could be their psychopathology prior to pregnancy,"" Beresford told CNN. ""For example, do they have a history of substance abuse or other mental health concerns that have contributed to them being in this situation which they cannot accept as a reality?"" Postnatal depression could also be a possible contributory factor, she said. ""That could be because when they're depressed they're not really of sound mind. It could be that they genuinely believe they are unworthy to be a parent. Or it could just be the level of disordered thinking that comes with being depressed."" CNN's Phil Black contributed to this report.","The bodies of eight infants were found in village in northern France .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- It was supposed to be a day celebrating Afghan achievements in education. Instead, Afghanistan's embattled president broke down crying at an official gathering commemorating International Literacy Day. In his emotional speech, Hamid Karzai lamented the estimated 10 million Afghans who are illiterate and repeated an appeal to Taliban militants to lay down their arms and expressed fear that his son might one day be forced to flee his country. ""I have pain in my heart,"" Karzai said, his voice breaking and his eyes red with tears. ""I'm afraid that my son, my own son will become a refugee one day. Please, I don't want my son and your son to be a foreign citizen. I want him to grow up here ...I want him to serve his nation,"" Karzai said, addressing an auditorium full of teachers, government ministers, foreign ambassadors and Girl Scouts gathered to celebrate the event. After wiping his face with a handkerchief, Karzai urged Afghans to do more to educate their children. Several bearded men in the audience brushed away tears as the Afghan leader concluded his speech. It's not clear what prompted the president's tearful soliloquy. But there is no question, Afghan observers say, that he and at least one close family member are currently facing strains on many fronts. ""Mr. Karzai is under a lot of pressure right now,"" said Mahmoud Saiqal, a former deputy foreign minister who served as a diplomat for several years under President Karzai. ""The constant drumbeat of negative news about progress in the country and news of problems with his family must be really having an effect on his ability to think clearly,"" said Candace Rondeaux, a Kabul-based analyst with the International Crisis Group. The growing Taliban-inspired insurgency claimed another prominent Afghan government victim Tuesday morning when a bomb ripped through the vehicle of the deputy governor of Ghazni province on his morning commute to work. The blast killed deputy governor Mohammad Kazem Allahyar, his brother, his son, and two civilian bystanders and wounded at least eight people including two bodyguards, said Ismail Jihangir, a spokesman for the Ghazni governor. In a statement on Tuesday, President Karzai's office condemned the attack, calling it an act of terrorism. Meanwhile, according to a report this week in the Wall Street Journal, one of the Afghan president's brothers, Mahmood Karzai, is currently being investigated by federal prosecutors in New York on charges of tax evasion. The New York Times reports the Afghan-American businessman is also being wiretapped by the U.S. National Security Agency. Speaking to CNN by telephone from Dubai on Tuesday, Mahmood Karzai denied any wrongdoing, calling allegations that he committed extortion and racketeering ""absolutely false"" and ""ridiculous."" He also said he was up to date on paying his U.S. taxes. ""All tax returns dating back to 1976 have been filed and completed."" Mahmood Karzai is an American citizen who splits his time between the United States, Dubai and Afghanistan. At the time of the overthrow of the Taliban, nearly nine years ago, Mahmood Karzai ran several Afghan restaurants in the United States. Today, he is the first vice chairman of the Afghanistan Chamber of Commerce and Industries and one of the most powerful businessmen in Afghanistan. Karzai is also a major shareholder of Kabul Bank, which is struggling to survive after a series of risky real estate investments in Dubai helped lead to a run on the bank by investors earlier this month. The chairman of Kabul Bank, Sherkhan Farnood, is also the chairman of the Afghanistan Chamber of Commerce. President Karzai has faced a drumbeat of criticism from Western governments in recent months, urging the Afghan government to crack down on corruption. Until the recent Kabul Bank crisis, much of the criticism was focused on another Karzai brother, Ahmad Wali Karzai. He is the chairman of the provincial council in Kandahar and one of the biggest power brokers in southern Afghanistan. In private conversations, Western diplomats often accuse Ahmad Wali Karzai of having links to Afghanistan's booming opium industry, charges Karzai routinely denies. ""It's not surprising that the U.S. government has turned its sights on members of the Karzai family,"" said Rondeaux of the International Crisis Group. ""The question is ...is this a pressure tactic that's being used on the part of the American diplomatic corps to get a more vigorous response to the corruption question?"" In his phone interview with CNN, businessman Mahmood Karzai said he had not yet been contacted by American officials regarding the reported investigations, but vowed to cooperate fully with U.S. prosecutors if they came calling. ""I have nothing to hide. It should be easy for them to investigate me."" The U.S. Attorney's office in the Southern District of New York will not confirm or deny to CNN whether prosecutors are investigating the Afghan president's brother. Asked about the reported investigation, U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden answered, ""We refer you to the Department of Justice because we do not comment on legal matters."" Some Afghan analysts, however, welcome the development. ""How long should we tolerate criminal activities and corruption at higher levels and let it go?"" asked Saiqal, the former Afghan diplomat. ""The majority of Afghans voted for Mr. Hamid Karzai, not his brother, not his cousin, not his tribe. Why anyone with the surname of Karzai should be in a position of power, that is an important question.""","Karzai says tearfully, ""I have pain in my heart""

"(CNN) -- The CNN-sponsored Lotus Racing Formula One team have revealed that chief technical officer Mike Gascoyne has signed a new five-year contract. Lotus only returned to the grid this year but, along with fellow-newcomers Virgin Racing and Hispania, have failed to score a single point so far. However, they have consistently out-performed their new fledling rivals and the experienced Gascoyne will now remain with the English-based outfit until 2015. Gascoyne -- who has also worked for McLaren, Tyrrell, Jordan, Benetton, Toyota and Spyker -- told the team's official website: ""It was always my intention to finish my career here, so it's great to have formally agreed a five-year deal. ""I'm extremely grateful to everyone involved in Lotus Racing for having the confidence to take this into a long-term contract.

"(CNN) -- Michigan Assistant Attorney General Andrew Shirvell -- who for nearly six months has blogged about an openly gay college student -- has taken a voluntary leave of absence, the state's attorney general's office confirmed to CNN Friday. The office does not know the length of Shirvell's leave, but says that it will hold a disciplinary hearing upon his return. Earlier this week, Attorney General Mike Cox defended his assistant's constitutional right to wage the internet campaign against Chris Armstrong, even though he said he considers Shirvell a ""bully."" ""Here in America, we have this thing called the First Amendment, which allows people to express what they think and engage in political and social speech,"" Cox told Anderson Cooper on CNN's ""AC 360"" on Wednesday night. ""He's clearly a bully ... but is that protected under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution? Yes."" ""Mr. [Andrew] Shirvell is sort of a frontline grunt assistant prosecutor in my office,"" Cox said. ""He does satisfactory work and off-hours, he's free to engage under both our civil service rules, Michigan Supreme Court rulings and the United States Supreme Court rule."" But Gov. Jennifer Granholm disagreed. Late Thursday she tweeted, ""If I was still attorney general and Andrew Shirvell worked for me, he would have already been fired."" For nearly six months, Shirvell has blogged about Armstrong, an openly gay student assembly president at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Shirvell has been banned from the Ann Arbor campus, said university spokeswoman Kelly Cunningham. The ban was in the form of a ""trespass warning"" issued by the university on September 14. Shirvell launched his blog in late April using the online moniker ""Concerned Michigan Alumnus."" ""Welcome to 'Chris Armstrong Watch,' "" Shirvell wrote in his inaugural blog post. ""This is a site for concerned University of Michigan alumni, students and others who oppose the recent election of Chris Armstrong -- a RADICAL HOMOSEXUAL ACTIVIST, RACIST, ELITIST, & LIAR -- as the new head of student government."" Among other things, Shirvell has published blog posts that accuse Armstrong of going back on a campaign promise he made to minority students; engaging in ""flagrant sexual promiscuity"" with another male member of the student government; sexually seducing and influencing ""a previously conservative [male] student"" so much so that the student, according to Shirvell, ""morphed into a proponent of the radical homosexual agenda;"" hosting a gay orgy in his dorm room in October 2009; and trying to recruit incoming first-year students ""to join the homosexual 'lifestyle.' "" In a written statement from his office on Tuesday, Cox distanced his office from Shirvell's comments. ""Mr. Shirvell's personal opinions are his and his alone, and do not reflect the views of the Michigan Department of Attorney General,"" Cox said in the statement. ""But his immaturity and lack of judgment outside the office are clear."" Shirvell said he works on the blog during his off-hours. On ""AC 360"" on Tuesday, Shirvell made no apologies for his blog postings, which include a picture of Armstrong with ""Resign"" written over his face. The same picture also had a swastika superimposed over a gay pride flag, with an arrow pointing toward Armstrong. Shirvell acknowledged protesting outside of Armstrong's house and calling him ""Satan's representative on the student assembly."" ""I'm a Christian citizen exercising my First Amendment rights,"" Shirvell told Cooper. ""I have no problem with the fact that Chris is a homosexual. I have a problem with the fact that he's advancing a radical homosexual agenda."" Armstrong has supported gender-neutral housing at the university for transgender students who haven't had sexual reassignment surgery. Armstrong told CNN he has hired an attorney and is pursuing legal action against Shirvell. Watch Anderson Cooper 360° weeknights 10pm ET.

"(CNN) -- It's common for newlyweds to honeymoon abroad. It's less common for them to fix kids' bikes during their trip -- but Aaron and Kristen Berlin did just that two days after saying their vows. The Massachusetts twentysomethings got married in October and spent five days volunteering at an orphanage in southern Thailand before exploring Bangkok, northern Thailand and Cambodia. ""We learned a lot about the culture,"" Aaron Berlin said. ""That was one of the great things about volunteering. We were really incorporated into the daily lives of the children and the volunteers who ran the orphanage."" The two are examples of what some call ""honeyteers"" --­ newlyweds whose honeymoons double as volunteer projects. These couples not only tour distant locales but also get involved with the communities they find there. ""I think it's just, going to Cabo is getting really old,"" said Alexia Nestora, who writes the blog Voluntourism Gal. ""This is a way to give back to the community and connect a bit more. Before, you had a bit of a stereotype of going out Peace Corps style. Now it's a bit more mainstream."" Today's newlyweds were in college when the ""volunteer boom"" began, she adds. Now that they have grown up and found jobs, they want to go back. Do celebs like Jolie inspire voluntourism? Lisa and Yvan Lagasse had long dreamed of visiting Africa by the time they booked their flight to Moshi, Tanzania, for their honeymoon. There, they taught English and French to teenagers in a boys' home through a Cross-Cultural Solutions volunteer program. The two had also talked about going to a beach, but the Moshi trip won out in the end. Both said the trip wouldn't have been the same without their companion. ""It's such a life-changing experience,"" said Lisa Lagasse, ""such a humbling experience, that to have someone there with you,­ especially your partner, who understands what you went through and learned­ -- without that, the experience would have almost died on us."" Complete coverage: Humanitarian Travel . During their four-week stay, the couple stayed in separate men's and women's housing during their honeymoon. It didn't matter, because they were there to volunteer -- and getting to know the local kids was the highlight of their trip. The Lagasses are incorporating Swahili into their own children's names and have even started looking into adoption. One day, they hope to bring their young son with them for a visit. ""We just want him to grow up to understand that there are other people in the world less fortunate than us, and we have to be thankful for everything we have,"" said Yvan Lagasse. Kam Santos of Cross-Cultural Solutions said the organization's volunteer projects all lead to an overarching goal. In other words, the work doesn't end after four weeks. The next group of volunteers moves the project forward. ""The relevance is in the continuity of the relationship and ongoing support of the organization,"" Santos said. ""What we see globally is increased attendance in schools and increased awareness of issues faced by the organizations."" Finding volunteer trips that actually help . For some couples, these kinds of trips also raise awareness about the life they will share with their partner. Lina Fenequito and Ray Mancini married in June 2008. They went on their honeymoon in Xi'an, China, about a year later when they could get time away from the web design company they own. Mancini said the trip was an opportunity to learn about his wife's heritage. ""Lina's mom is from China, and I know Chinese people here, but it really gave me an appreciation for the culture and the incredible history,"" he said. ""When you go there, it's just overwhelming. When we have children, they'll have a part of this. It'll be part of their heritage and their history. It sounds very sentimental, but that's what I felt."" The couple taught English to students ages 8 to 14, collaborating with translators on lesson plans. In one of the scenarios they designed, students ""bought"" clothes using fake money, then modeled them in a classroom fashion show. The experience showed Mancini another side of his wife. ""I saw her as a teacher, as there with the children, and that's exciting for someone hoping to be a father some day. You see her as a leader. She knows a little Chinese, and I don't know a lot, so it was nice to see her getting us around and helping me out."" ""It's a bonding experience,"" Fenequito added.","""Honeyteers"" are newlyweds whose honeymoons double as volunteer projects .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- A federal audit of $9.1 billion targeted for reconstruction in Iraq cannot account for more than 95 percent of it, a federal report said Tuesday. The report, by the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, blamed ""weaknesses in DoD's [the Department of Defense's] financial and management controls"" and called on the Pentagon to improve its financial and management controls. The audit centered on the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI), which was established in May 2003 by the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA). After the CPA was dissolved in June 2004, the Iraqi government authorized the U.S. government to administer the funds used for reconstruction. The Pentagon managed the DFI funds until the end of 2007, when its authority was withdrawn. The special inspector general reviewed records from eight Defense Department organizations that received DFI funds. ""This situation occurred because most DoD organizations receiving DFI funds did not establish the required Department of the Treasury accounts and no DoD organization was designated as the executive agent for managing the use of DFI funds,"" the report concluded. ""The breakdown in controls left the funds vulnerable to inappropriate uses and undetected loss.""","Report: More than 95 percent of $9.1 billion cannot be accounted for .

"(CNN) -- Two failed bomb attempts by the Somali Islamist group Al-Shabaab killed 11 militants around Mogadishu, Somalia's transitional government said Saturday. In the first incident, militants were working on a car bomb in a house near Shirkole, north of the capital, when the device detonated, killing 10, the government said in a news release Saturday. Another Al-Shabaab member was killed while planting a roadside bomb on Mogadishu's Ansaloti bridge, according to the release. Authorities arrested two other individuals suspected of guarding the militant who died.

""Only luck has prevented the deaths of many innocent citizens of Mogadishu.""

"(CNN) -- World number one Tiger Woods and his partner Steve Stricker will take on English duo Ian Poulter and Ross Fisher in the opening fourballs of the 38th Ryder Cup at Celtic Manor, Wales, on Friday. United States captain Corey Pavin named Woods and world number four Stricker as his third pairing for the first round of matches in the biennial contest against Europe. The duo won all five of their matches at the Presidents Cup last year. Europe captain Colin Montgomerie said Poulter would ""relish"" his dual with Woods. The Englishman, ranked 16th in the world, is known for his colorful dress on the course and once claimed he would emerge as the main rival to the American's status as the game's top player. The first match on Friday morning will feature world number two Phil Mickelson and Dustin Johnson for the U.S. against a strong European pairing of third-ranked Lee Westwood and Martin Kaymer, who won the US PGA Championship last month. Second up are 2009 British Open champion Stewart Cink and Matt Kuchar for the U.S. against Northern Irish duo Graeme McDowell and Rory McIlory. And after the Woods-Poulter match, U.S. rookies Bubba Watson and Jeff Overton will take on three-time major winner Padraig Harrington and England's Luke Donald. The Europeans are aiming to regain the trophy which was surrendered to the U.S. in Valhalla, Kentucky, two years ago. The teams will play a set of four fourball and four foursome matches on Friday and Saturday before all 12 players compete over the singles format on Sunday. The winning team will be the first to reach 14 ½ points. Woods was named as one of Pavin's four captain's picks after failing to qualify automatically for the team following his break from the game in the wake of revelations about his private life. The 14-time major winner has struggled to reproduce his best form in the sport's most prestigious team event, winning just 10, and losing 13 of his 25 matches. Mickelson's record is even worse, with just 10 victories from 30 matches and 14 defeats. Westwood, who has not played since July following a calf injury, has the most impressive pedigree in the event of any player on either team, having racked up 14 wins in six appearances. ""I felt that the honor of hitting the first shot for Europe should go to Lee Westwood,"" Montgomerie said at the televised opening ceremony. Perhaps the most surprising selection was Pavin's decision to leave out Jim Furyk from the opening fourballs. The world number five won the $10m Tour Championship and FedEx Cup last week. ""You have to sit somebody out,"" Pavin told reporters. ""That's a decision a captain has to make. If you have any better suggestions I'd love to hear them.""","Tiger Woods and Steve Stricker to take on Ian Poulter and Ross Fisher in fourballs at Ryder Cup .

"(CNN) -- The Haskell County, Oklahoma, Commission has 10 years to pay attorneys' fees of $199,000 after it was forced to remove an 8-foot-tall Ten Commandments monument. The county has been in litigation with the American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma since 2006, after it allowed a resident to pay for and erect the granite monument on the courthouse lawn in Stigler. After a series of court decisions up to the U.S. Supreme Court, which refused to hear the case, the ACLU prevailed. The monument was removed in March, and the attorneys' fees were settled last week, ACLU attorney Micheal Salem said. Salem said the commandments were moved to private property owned by the American Legion about 150 feet from the courthouse. ACLU Deputy Director Chuck Thornton said that when the commandments were erected on public property, it became an endorsement of religion. ""It's a very unwelcoming thing for those who do not subscribe to the Judeo (Christian) belief system. The government should not be in the business of showing favoritism or endorsing religion,"" he said. ""The ACLU would never have been involved if it was somewhere other than public property. We don't want to squelch anyone's rights of free expression."" An attorney for the Alliance Defense League, which represented the county, did not return a call for comment.

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Worth an estimated $2.1bn, Aliko Dangote is one of the richest men in Africa. The Dangote Group, which he started in 1977, trading in commodities and building materials, is now a multi-billion dollar conglomerate spanning West Africa. Today, the business covers flour, sugar, pasta, clothing and cement which made Dangote Nigeria's first billionaire in 2007, according to Forbes magazine. Forbes said Dangote, 53, began his business at the age of 21 with a loan from his uncle. He studied business studies at Al-Azahar University, Cairo, Egypt. Dangote said one of his cement factories, 30 minutes from Lagos, is already one of the largest in the world, and there are plans to double its capacity. He is building another cement factory in Ibese, with workers from Nigeria, China and India. Dangote is now one of the largest private sector employers in Nigeria, with a nationwide workforce of 12000, a figure that is set to rise with the opening of new factories. Forbes puts Dangote at number 463 on its 2010 list of the world's billionaires, estimating his fortune to be $2.1bn. It said that Dangote's commodities had helped him survive Nigeria's financial meltdown last year, although his fortune has diminished from $3.3 bn in 2008. Dangote told CNN he was motivated to create an African success story and to create employment in his home country. He said he was proud of his achievements: ""I feel great. I'm feeling fulfilled that at least you are doing something great for your country. ""Nigeria is really the best place to invest. It is one of the best places to make money. You know all over the world it is the best kept secret actually in terms of investment."" His drive is indisputable. Dangote says he works 12-hour days which always begin at 5am. Despite the trappings of wealth -- he has two private planes and said he can't remember when he last flew on a commercial airline -- Dangote, married with two children, according to Forbes, says he lives a relatively simple life. ""I like exercising a lot,"" he said. ""I go to the gym almost every day and I do about 15 km at least 6 times a week."" Dangote also says he is committed to improving the conditions of those living close to his factory, as part of his philosophy of corporate social responsibility.","Aliko Dangote became Nigeria's first billionaire in 2007 .

"(CNN) -- North and South Korea reached agreement Friday on where to temporarily reunite families separated by the Korean War nearly 60 years ago, the Yonhap news agency said. Earlier talks had bogged down over where to hold the reunions. They will be held from October 30 to November 5 at the two countries' joint mountain resort in the North, Mount Kumgang. Negotiators met Friday in the North Korean border town of Kaesong. No further details were immediately available about the reunions or the talks. Millions of families were separated by the Korean War, which ended in 1953 with a cease-fire, but without a formal peace treaty. About 10,000 people applied to take part in a similar reunion last year, but fewer than 200 families were allowed to participate. Family members wept as they saw one another for the first time in decades. No mail, telephone or e-mail exchanges exist between ordinary citizens across the Korean border. The families were allowed to spend a few days together before the South Koreans had to return home. Fewer than 21,000 family members have reunited since 2000, when North and South held their first summit, Yonhap said. About one-fifth of them have reunited via video.","NEW: The families will reunite at the two countries' joint mountain resort in the North .

"(CNN) -- South Korea's prime minister has offered to resign for a second time, the prime minister's office said Thursday, after failure to win parliamentary approval to stop relocation of government offices out of the capital, Seoul. ""I personally greatly regret that I couldn't complete the Sejong project, even though I've revised the project,"" Prime Minister Chung Un-chan said in a statement on his website. ""I feel guilty that I couldn't prevent the waste of government resources and disorder it will bring (to the government)."" It was not immediately clear if President Lee Myung-bak would accept Chan's resignation. Chung verbally offered to resign on July 5, but Lee did not accept his offer at that time. The offer came after failure to win parliamentary approval to stop the relocation effort, a major setback to Lee's government and a sign that his party is losing clout. The president's Grand National Party has taken a beating in recent local elections, which analysts see as a referendum on his handling of the Cheonan incident. The South Korean naval ship Cheonan sank March 26 in disputed waters. The loss of the ship and 46 sailors raised tensions on the Korean Peninsula. North Korea has vehemently denied charges it fired a torpedo that sank the Cheonan.","Chung Un-chan first offered his resignation on July 5 .

"(CNN) -- Which football team has the best record in one of Europe's elite leagues? Well it isn't Barcelona or Real Madrid, Manchester United or Chelsea, or even one of the Milan giants. In fact, a 2-1 victory at the home of German champions Bayern Munich has put this particular side, who are virtually unknown outside their native country, on the verge of entering the record books. The ""Carnival Boys"" of FSV Mainz 05, the club that represents the city of the same name on the west bank of the Rhine, will equal a Bundesliga record of seven straight wins from the start of the season if they beat Hoffenheim this weekend. Mainz are nicknamed the ""Carnival Boys"" for good reason. From November through to March, every year, the city plays host to the ""Mainzer Fastnacht"" a traditional carnival that places an emphasis on political and literary humor and commentary. It is an important and long-standing event in the German calendar and the football club has embraced the cultural significance that the carnival brings with it. German football expert Rafael Honigstein told CNN that Mainz had risen to the summit of the Bundesliga by creating a similar party atmosphere around the club. ""The youth and exuberance of the side blends in perfectly with the party atmosphere that the city of Mainz cultivates,"" said Honigstein. ""Mainz have always been known as the carnival club. The players have a close link with the fans and go and celebrate with them at the end of each game, win, lose or draw. ""In the past they were just happy to be members of the Bundesliga -- and that was worth a celebration in itself. But now with the success of this young team, some of the players have taken things one step further. ""Three of the players, Lewis Holtby, Andre Schurrle and Adam Szalai, have taken on the self-proclaimed title of the 'Mainz Boyband.' When anybody scores a goal they start playing imaginary musical instruments. One is the guitarist, one the drummer and also the singer. ""It has become a big theme for the players and the team are riding the crest of a wave on the back of the atmosphere generated by coach Thomas Tuchel, himself only 37. ""Basically Tuchel is a coaching genius, he is just like (Real Madrid coach) Jose Mourinho -- but minus the ego,"" added Honigstein. That interaction with their supporters is another ingredient which sets Mainz apart from the majority of their Bundesliga rivals. Frank Trautman, a spokesman for the Mainz supporters' club, told CNN: ""The atmosphere for home matches is unbelievable and I love the fact the profile of the team and the city has risen during this winning run. ""For a long time there has been a great rapport between the fans and the players -- and the media have really picked up on the fact that the players like to party with the fans. ""The image of Mainz, both the team and the city, used to be of people and players not to be taken seriously. But now, with our current success, we are being seen in a different light."" And Mainz's success on the pitch is now translating to an increased awareness of the city off the pitch. With the carnival just over a month away, the city is now suddenly on the front pages, as well as the back pages, of national newspapers. ""We are starting to get more emails and queries about the carnival and the city,"" Ralf Peterhanwahr -- a press officer for the city of Mainz -- told CNN. ""The team are now being viewed as being young, successful and good looking and that is a great image for the city to have, especially with the carnival almost upon us. ""The people of Mainz love to party and having the team making the headlines is the best advertisement the city can have. Everybody in Germany is talking about Mainz now."" And not just in Germany; should Hoffenheim go the same way as Bayern Munich this weekend, the ""Carnival Boys"" will once again be making headlines across Europe.","Bundesliga minnows Mainz have won their first six matches this season .

"(CNN) -- The second round of talks between North Korea and the U.S.-led U.N. Command on the peninsula ended Friday. The talks were designed to set the stage for higher-level discussions on the sinking of a South Korean warship, for which North Korea has been blamed. The two sides met for about an hour and 45 minutes, a spokesman with the U.N. Command told CNN. They agreed to hold another colonel-level meeting next Thursday. Friday's was the second meeting between the two parties since the March attack on the Cheonan, which killed 46 South Korean sailors. An international investigation blamed North Korea for the sinking, an assertion the North has denied. Officers from both sides met in Panmunjom in the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea. The demilitarized zone was created as part of the armistice signed between the two Koreas in 1953 that halted fighting in the Korean War, but the war has never officially ended. The United Nations and North Korea began occasional meetings between generals -- ""general officer talks"" -- at Panmunjom in 1998 in an effort to lessen tensions. South Korea has said that an investigation concluded that a North Korean submarine fired a torpedo that sunk the South Korea warship. Earlier this month, the United Nations formally condemned the sinking of the Cheonan, but did not specifically name North Korea. ""The Security Council deplores the attack,"" the 15-member council said in what is known as a presidential statement. It urged that ""appropriate and peaceful measures be taken against those responsible for the incident aimed at the peaceful settlement of the issue."" It also called for full adherence to the 1953 armistice agreement. At the Friday meeting, the U.N. Command proposed a joint group to assess any armistice violations in the warship's sinking. The two sides adjourned after they agreed to develop specific proposals, the Command said.","NEW: The two sides will meet again next Thursday .

"Paris, France (CNN) -- A strike by air-traffic controllers affected flights Wednesday across France, resulting in cancellations of 10 percent of scheduled flights from Paris' main international airport, the civil aviation authority DGAC said. In addition to the cancellations at Roissy Charles de Gaulle Airport, half of the flights from Orly, the nation's second-largest airport, were canceled, the authority said. Would-be passengers were urged to contact their airlines prior to traveling to the airport. Ireland's low-cost airline Ryanair called Wednesday for the French government to get the French military, ""if necessary,"" to take over air traffic control duties while civilian air traffic controllers are on strike. ""France, passengers and airlines cannot afford these airport closures at a time when traffic and tourism is suffering,"" Ryanair said in a statement. The timing coincides with the beginning of summer vacations for many French. One EasyJet passenger who was at Orly when she found out her flight had been canceled until Thursday bemoaned her situation.  ""In the middle of July, it's tough to find a place to stay,"" said Nawel Boubouka. The strike started Tuesday evening and is scheduled to end Thursday at 6 a.m. Controllers are striking over plans to unify European air traffic control. France is due to join Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg to form what is being called Functional Airspace Block Europe Central (FABEC). FABEC is a cornerstone of the Single European Sky project, which advocates say will reduce fuel use and flight times by making it possible for planes to fly more direct routes across the continent. The FABEC area covers 1,713,442 square km (661,560 sq miles) and is characterized by closely interlaced civil and military traffic routes, its website says. Most of the large European airports and major civil and military airways are located in the FABEC area.","Air passengers in France are urged to contact their airlines before going to the airport .

"(CNN) -- Arguably the best fake newsman on television, comedian Stephen Colbert knows how to deliver a one-liner. But his invitation to testify before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on immigration was the real joke. Speaker Nancy Pelosi cited Colbert's ""ability to bring attention to an important issue like immigration"" in declaring the hearing appropriate. This helps explain why voters may ensure she is fired as speaker in November. She simply doesn't get it. Does anyone believe that the real problem with immigration is a lack of attention to the issue? Ever since Arizona and other states began addressing immigration on their own, there has been no shortage of media attention. The fact that Congress has failed to do its fundamental job of adequately securing the borders and enforcing the law is lost on no one. The real question is: What is Congress doing to fix it? The answer: Nothing. In the 21 months I have served on the Immigration Subcommittee, we have met 11 times. Not once have we marked up what I would consider a substantive bill to address meaningfully our current immigration policy. Although I have sponsored and co-sponsored more than a dozen bills and resolutions on immigration none has ever been given time before the subcommittee. Instead, we have considered private relief bills and extensions of the status quo and discussed procedural issues. Partisanship is not the problem. One of the resolutions I sponsored had 12 Republicans and 10 Democrats on board as original co-sponsors and now has over 60 co-sponsors. The resolution would make E-Verify mandatory for all employers, provide sufficient border infrastructure and manpower; and reject amnesty and any legal status that pardons those here in violation of our laws. Somehow, the Congress hasn't found time to discuss that legislation, either. Instead, the Democrats brought in Colbert. I skipped the Colbert hearing and returned to Utah to attend the viewing of a Utah soldier who was killed in Afghanistan. As much as I enjoy the comedy of Stephen Colbert, I don't believe C-SPAN is the place to watch it. The entire fiasco only highlights the fact that during a time when Democrats control the House, the Senate and the presidency, the Subcommittee on Immigration has done virtually nothing. Meaningful action on immigration reform has been paralyzed in part by broad disagreement over the issue of ""amnesty"" Disagreements center on what constitutes amnesty and whether current proposals by advocates for legalization of illegal immigrants represent an amnesty akin to what passed in 1986. But there is plenty of common ground on other immigration issues. Most of us on the subcommittee would agree that we need to fix legal immigration. It can take decades to get through the process legally. That doesn't work for anyone. Yet nothing has changed. If the Colbert hearing was an attempt to distract voters from recognizing how little has actually been done, the strategy backfired. Voters live every day with the consequences of how little has been done. They deserve leadership in Congress that will take the issue of immigration seriously instead of turning it into a comedy bit. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jason Chaffetz.","Rep. Jason Chaffetz that inviting comedian to testify was a distraction .

"(CNN) -- It's arguably one of the largest pieces of Elvis Presley memorabilia ever: a 154.5-acre ranch in Horn Lake, Mississippi, once owned by the king of rock 'n' roll. Elvis Presley bought the property in February 1967, three months before marrying Priscilla Beaulieu. And it's on the market, with an asking price of $6.5 million. ""It had a large cross there that Elvis really liked, and a concrete bridge over a 14-acre lake,"" real estate agent Rodger Motz told CNN. The property, called the ""Elvis Ranch"" by locals, is just east of Highway 301 in Horn Lake, about 17 miles south of Memphis, Tennessee. Presley purchased it in February 1967, three months before he married Priscilla Beaulieu, according to a Graceland spokeswoman. The deed on record was signed by Presley's longtime manager, Col. Tom Parker, said Parker Pickle, Desoto County tax assessor. There is a small house known as the ""Honeymoon Cottage"" on the property. Graceland confirmed the newly married Presleys did spend time there following their honeymoon in Palm Springs, California. The property has been on the market since last month. Its current owners are Dennis McLemore and his brothers. McLemore said his parents bought the property in 1979 and turned it into a cattle ranch after previous owner-developers had failed to turn it into a resort. McLemore said he met Priscilla Presley on a winter day in 1985. ""I got a call one day that Priscilla was coming up for a visit,"" he said. ""I'd been working on a cow's ear and was covered in blood when she came up. She told me Elvis would have been proud this was a working cattle ranch."" Tours occasionally have driven down from Memphis with passengers who took pictures of the pastures, he said. At one time, there was a 12-foot wooden fence around the compound with a half-dozen trailers on the grounds, where members of Presley's entourage, the ""Memphis Mafia"" were housed. ""There's still a trailer pad behind the Honeymoon Cottage,"" McLemore said. ""I remember as a child when Elvis owned it,"" said Anita Rainey, planning director for the city of Horn Lake. ""I had a friend he gave a horse to. She lived across the street to the ranch and woke up one day and they had a pony."" She said she remembers seeing Presley riding a horse along the highway. He was a quiet owner, she said, and the ranch is prime real estate. ""I've been getting a lot of calls from media,"" Motz said, ""and the Europeans are really interested."" However, he said, he doesn't have a serious buyer on the hook and has yet to receive an offer.","154.5-acre ranch in Horn Lake, Mississippi, once lived in by Elvis Presley .

"United Nations (CNN) -- The United Nations Security Council has renewed the mandate of its mission in the Darfur region of Sudan for another 12 months. Council members made the decision Friday, a day before the current mandate was due to end. They demanded that the parties involved in the conflict immediately end the fighting as well as attacks on civilians, peacekeepers and humanitarian personnel. The Security Council heard a report earlier this week from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon that fighting has intensified between rebel groups and the Sudanese government. May was the most fatal month in Darfur since the U.N. mission deployed there three years ago, and violent incidents in recent months have surpassed the bloodshed in the same period last year, members said. Ban had recommended that Security Council members renew the mission to ""expand the work that it has painstakingly begun."" As many as 300,000 people are thought to have died and at least 2.5 million have been displaced from their homes in Darfur since fighting broke out in 2003 between the government, the government-allied Janjaweed militia, and other armed rebel groups, the United Nations says. The conflict has been marked by widespread atrocities, including the murder of civilians and the rape of women and girls, the United Nations says. The U.N. mission, known by its acronym UNAMID, took over from African Union peacekeepers in Darfur in late 2007. The force has been hampered, however, by a lack of cooperation from the Sudanese government and a lack of troops, according to the United Nations.","U.N.

"(Health.com) -- Cleanup workers exposed to spilled oil may be at long-term risk for breathing trouble and other health problems, according to a new study examining the aftereffects of a 2002 oil spill in Spain. However, it's not clear whether the respiratory problems reported by the workers in the study are likely to crop up in the more than 50,000 people who have helped clean up the spill in the Gulf of Mexico caused by the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig. ""We can't assume it's going to be the same here as it was there,"" says David Savitz, Ph.D., a professor of community health and ob-gyn at the Brown University School of Medicine, in Providence, R.I. ""But this shows that there is the potential for health effects that go well beyond the immediate period of exposure, and it reinforces what we've known before -- that respiratory health effects are high on that list,"" adds Savitz, co-author of an editorial accompanying the study. Health.com: Can't stop coughing? 8 possible reasons . The study, which appears in the Annals of Internal Medicine, included 501 fishermen who helped clean up spilled oil after the tanker Prestige sank off the coast of Spain in November 2002. The researchers compared the workers with a similar group of 176 fishermen who did not participate in the cleanup efforts. Two years after the accident, the fishermen who were exposed to oil were more likely to report wheezing, chronic cough, and other respiratory symptoms compared with those in the control group. The breath of the exposed fishermen also contained higher levels of chemicals associated with lung damage. (Smokers were excluded from these tests.) In addition, the researchers found higher rates of chromosome changes in the white blood cells of the exposed fishermen -- changes that have been linked to an increased risk of cancer in other studies, says Gina Solomon, M.D., a senior scientist with the National Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit environmental group. Health.com: 7 surprising triggers of lung trouble . ""Given these chromosomal abnormalities, I'd also worry about effects on sperm and egg cells,"" says Solomon, who was not involved in the study. The study results ""indicate that participation in the cleanup of oil spills can have undesirable effects on health,"" says the lead researcher, Joan Albert Barberà, M.D., but he stresses that the cleanup workers in the study weren't sick. ""No evidence was found of any active illness, only biological alterations that might predispose to develop disease,"" says Barberà, a professor at the August Pi i Sunyer Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBAPS), in Barcelona. The findings suggest that doctors and health officials in the U.S. should be on the lookout for respiratory problems in workers who were exposed to the huge amounts of oil that gushed from the recently capped leak in the Gulf of Mexico. Health.com: Breathing tips for people with COPD . But the two spills aren't necessarily comparable, experts say. For starters, the Prestige spill -- which was roughly one-tenth the size of the Deepwater Horizon spill -- involved bunker oil, which contains different proportions of carcinogenic compounds (notably polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and benzene) than the crude oil spilled in the Gulf, according to Solomon. Moreover, the oil from the Prestige was spilled on the surface and therefore may have had a different makeup from the oil from the Deepwater Horizon well, which ascended through almost a mile of water before it could make human contact, says Arch ""Chip"" Carson, M.D., a professor of occupational and environmental health at the University of Texas at Houston School of Public Health. The oil that cleanup workers in the Gulf will encounter is ""reasonably friendly bad stuff,"" Carson says. ""The likelihood of respiratory problems for these workers is negligible."" Oil isn't the only hazard, Carson points out. The dispersants used in both cleanup efforts could potentially cause respiratory effects as well. Health.com: Gulf oil spill still a health threat to many . The U.S. National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences recently announced the launch of a long-term study, known as the Gulf Worker Study, to investigate potential health problems stemming from the Deepwater Horizon spill. Although the Prestige spill may not be a perfect comparison, it still highlights the need to safeguard cleanup workers in the U.S., Solomon says. ""Gulf workers need to have adequate training and protective equipment, as well as access to health care and evaluations,"" she says. ""And they are going to need careful follow-up for years to come to make sure that if they do develop health problems, they are recognized and addressed.""

"(CNN) -- Embattled Calumet County, Wisconsin, District Attorney Ken Kratz has resigned amid a texting scandal, according to the office of Gov. Jim Doyle. Two weeks ago, at a news conference, Kratz apologized for sending personal texts to a domestic abuse victim while prosecuting her former boyfriend. At the time, he said he wouldn't step down from office. Wisconsin Department of Justice officials said some of Kratz's texts ""cross the line and can be construed as sexual harassment."" They cited a specific text that refers to the woman as a ""tall, young, hot nymph,"" and another that says, ""You are beautiful and would make a great partner someday."" E-mails from November 2009 between Kratz and the Wisconsin Department of Justice show Kratz denied wrongdoing for weeks before finally saying, ""My behavior was inappropriate."" Kratz also recently went on medical leave. In recent months, several local and state domestic violence organizations have called on Kratz to resign as district attorney.

"(CNN) -- The British government condemned China's execution of a British national Tuesday on drug smuggling charges. ""I ... am appalled and disappointed that our persistent requests for clemency have not been granted,"" Prime Minister Gordon Brown said. ""I am particularly concerned that no mental health assessment was undertaken."" Akmal Shaikh was convicted of carrying up to 4 kilograms (8.8 pounds) of heroin at the Urumqi Airport in September 2007. According to Chinese law, 50 grams (1.76 ounces) is the threshold for the death penalty. China defended the execution in a statement issued by the Chinese Embassy in London. ""Drug trafficking is a grave crime worldwide,"" the statement said. ""The concerns of the British side have been duly noted and taken into consideration by the Chinese judicial authorities in the legal process, and Mr. Shaikh's rights and interests under Chinese law are properly respected and guaranteed."" The 53-year-old is the first European executed in China in 50 years, according to the British legal group Reprieve. ""We are deeply saddened, stunned and disappointed at the news of the execution of our beloved cousin, Akmal,"" Soohail and Nasir Shaikh said in a statement issued on behalf of the family. ""This was carried out this morning despite repeated requests for clemency and a proper appraisal of Akmal's mental state."" His family and the British government had asked Chinese leaders for clemency. His supporters argued that Shaikh was mentally ill, and that Chinese officials did not take his mental condition into account when trying him. Shaikh's advocates say he suffered from a bipolar disorder and that he was tricked into carrying heroin into China with promises of a career as a pop singer. Brown raised Shaikh's case with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao during the international climate summit in Denmark earlier this month. British Foreign Secretary David Miliband echoed Gordon's concerns about the execution. ""The UK is completely opposed to the use of the death penalty in all circumstances,"" Miliband said. ""However, I also deeply regret the fact that our specific concerns about the individual in this case were not taken into consideration. ... These included mental health issues, and inadequate professional interpretation during the trial."" Sally Rowen, legal director with Reprieve, condemned the execution. ""The death of Akmal Shaikh is a sad indictment of today's world, and particularly of China's legal system,"" she said. ""Akmal was a gentle man who suffered from a tormenting illness ... and was betrayed and deliberately killed by one of the most powerful nations on Earth."" Before the execution, Philip Alston, the U.N. special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions, said it would be a ""major step backwards for China"" to execute a mentally ill man. ""Both Chinese and international law clearly indicate that a person who committed a crime while suffering from significant mental illness should not be subjected to the death penalty,"" Alston said in a statement released by Reprieve. China expressed hope that the case would not affect the relationship between the two nations. ""We value the China-British relationship,"" said Jiang Yu, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman. ""So we hope the British authority can treat this matter rationally and not let it create new barrier between the two countries. I have emphasized that this is an independent criminal case. It has nothing to do with anything else.""","NEW: China defended the execution in a statement issued by the Chinese Embassy in London .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: This Tuesday, March 9th, CNN Student News is going global; we have a lot of headlines to tell you about from around the world. Our first story today takes us to Turkey. First Up: Turkey Earthquake . AZUZ: Some residents there are dealing with the effects of an earthquake that killed more than 50 people. More than 70 others were injured by the quake. It struck early Monday morning. It had a magnitude of 5.9, so not as powerful as some of the tremors recently we've seen from Haiti and from Chile, but like those earthquakes, this one was followed by dozens of aftershocks. It happened in the southeastern part of Turkey. The Middle Eastern country, it's a little bit bigger than the U.S. state of Texas. It's located between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. The quake hit in Turkey's Elazig province. It's located in a mountain region. In some of the cities there, many homes are made out of mud, instead of concrete. Turkish authorities say most of those were destroyed, although other buildings, like schools, are still standing. Relief efforts are already getting going. One official said residents ""are sad, but they are calm."" He added that the country is meeting the victims' needs. Just to give you some background, Turkey was established as a country in 1923 from part of what remained of the Ottoman Empire. It's home to about 77 million people. It's also no stranger to powerful earthquakes. In 1999, two quakes hit near Istanbul, Turkey's largest city. Those killed at least 20,000 people. Monday's tremor hit near the point where two major fault lines meet. It's an area that some scientists describe as unstable. Is this Legit? MATT CHERRY, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? Pakistan is east of Afghanistan. Legit! The two countries share a border that's more than 1,500 miles long. Pakistan Bombing . AZUZ: The Taliban, a militant, Islamic group you've heard a lot about lately has caused violence in both of those countries, and it says it's responsible for this suicide bombing in Pakistan. The attack happened in Lahore, Pakistan's second-largest city. It's located on the opposite side of the country from Afghanistan. The blast targeted a law enforcement agency. It killed at least a dozen people, injured more than a hundred others. Many of those victims were being treated at nearby hospitals. A spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban said the attack was a response to what he called U.S. aggression against Muslims around the world. A Pakistani official says the Taliban is trying to destabilize the country. But the government, he says, will not let them succeed. Afghan Offensive . AZUZ: Hopping back over that border to Afghanistan, where U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates made an unscheduled visit yesterday. Secretary Gates said part of the reason he was there was to get an update on Operation Moshtarak. We've told you a lot about that in recent weeks. Moshtarak is a military offensive against the Taliban; it's focused on the city of Marjah. Gates arrived in the capital city of Kabul on Monday. He was scheduled to meet with Afghan president Hamid Karzai as well as General Stanley McChrystal, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan. During the visit, the defense secretary said Marjah is just part of the fight. U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY ROBERT GATES: Of course, the operation in Marjah is only one of many battles to come in a much longer campaign focused on protecting the people of Afghanistan. AZUZ: The day before Secretary Gates arrived in Afghanistan, President Karzai, along with General McChrystal, went to Marjah to talk to the people there about the fight against the Taliban. Phil Black has more on that. (BEGIN VIDEO) PHIL BLACK, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: President Hamid Karzai traveled to Marjah to tell its population the Taliban would not be coming back. Hundreds filled a mosque to hear him speak and to tell him what they thought. They didn't hold back. They demanded schools, roads, hospitals and an honest police force. The president promised to rebuild their town. HAMID KARZAI, AFGHANISTAN PRESIDENT: I heard them. They heard me. They had some very legitimate complaints. Very, very legitimate. They felt as if they were abandoned which, in many cases, is true. GEN. STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL, COMMANDER, INTERNATIONAL SECURITY ASSISTANCE FORCE: What I heard today is frustrations with things that people are going to be frustrated with war. But there's always frustration with the costs of war and how we operate. BLACK: General McChrystal's strategy is at work here: push the Taliban out, then stay and hold the ground while local government, police and services are established. But the population is skeptical. The Taliban have been cleared out before and allowed to return. (END VIDEO) Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! What is this activity better known as?

That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Stepping Controversy . AZUZ: Stepping's been part of African-American culture for decades, especially on college campuses. Around 16 years ago, one sorority at a university in Arkansas taught the members of another sorority how to step. But when that second sorority took the title at a national competition last month, it stepped into the middle of controversy. Don Lemon explains why and what happened afterward. (BEGIN VIDEO) DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: This is stepping, a proud mix of tribal dance infusing military drills and popular culture. Dominated by African American fraternities and sororities for decades, until the ladies of Arkansas's Zeta Tau Alpha, an all-white team, stepped into a national competition and nailed it. RYAN CAMERON, EMCEE, RADIO PERSONALITY: Who do you all think it is? That's right. It is the Zetas. Zetas, Zetas, Zetas, first place. LEMON: Their win stunned the crowd of nearly 5,000 people.

"(CNN) -- The mother of a man reportedly killed by pirates on a lake along the U.S.-Mexico border pleaded for help in finding her son's body Tuesday. Appearing on NBC's ""Today"" show, David Hartley's mother, Pam Hartley, tearfully asked Mexican authorities and the public to help recover his remains. ""Please, everybody call your Congress. Call anybody you can to have them get us over there. He has to come home,"" she said. ""President Obama, help us. President of Mexico, help us, please."" Hartley's wife Tiffany reported that she and her husband were riding personal watercraft Thursday on the Mexican side of Falcon Lake when they were attacked by gunmen on three boats. Hartley was shot and fell into the water, his wife told sheriff's deputies in Zapata County, Texas, but his body has yet to be found. ""He was thrown off the Jet Ski and I couldn't pick him up to get him on mine,"" Hartley told a sheriff's dispatcher in a 911 call released by the agency. Speaking on the CBS ""Early Show"" on Tuesday, Tiffany Hartley said she didn't believe Mexican investigators were looking for her husband's remains, and suggested that his killers had the body. ""We understand the possibility that the people who did this probably have him, and that's why maybe they can't find him,"" she said. There was no immediate response from officials in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas to her remarks. But Zapata County Sheriff Sigifredo Gonzalez Jr. told CNN on Monday that his agency has contacted Mexican authorities ""on a daily basis"" and was trying to coordinate search efforts by volunteers, but had received no response. U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, the area's congressman, said he has asked federal agencies to press for support for the search from their Mexican counterparts. ""I have contacted the Mexican Embassy and urged them to move the case quickly,"" Cuellar said in a statement issued Tuesday afternoon. A man Tiffany Hartley approached for help told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" that a boat was following her before she came ashore, but veered off as she neared land. ""She right away told me, gave me instructions as far as to call law enforcement and an ambulance because 'My husband's been shot,' "" said the man, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said Hartley was ""frantic -- crying, sobbing. I mean, she looked very, very jittery."" The reservoir is on the Rio Grande River, about 200 miles south of San Antonio, and straddles the border between Texas and Tamaulipas. The Mexican state has made headlines recently as a hotbed for drug cartel violence, and Gonzalez said he believes the attackers were pirates linked to the cartels. ""My understanding is they're 15, 16, 17-year-olds that have been given automatic weapons. They barely know how to use them,"" Gonzalez told CNN on Monday. ""They don't even know where the safeties are at."" There have been at least four cases of gunmen in Mexican waters robbing or threatening boaters since April, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety. The department has warned boaters to stay on the U.S. side of the lake since May. Richard Drake, an area fisherman, told CNN he was chased by men carrying AK-47 rifles on Falcon Lake in May. They got to within 15 yards of his boat, which he said was along the international boundary. ""Fortunately, I had a faster boat than they did, so I outran them,"" he said. ""They chased me for about a mile, mile and a half, and then they tailed off."" He said local fishermen had heard ""that there were some people being robbed"" and were advising boaters to avoid the Mexican side of the lake, ""so I wasn't on the Mexican side. I was going down the middle of the lake when they kind of came out of the brush and kind of ambushed me.""","NEW: The missing man's mother pleads for help finding him .

"(CNN) -- English Premier League side Tottenham have confirmed that Brazil midfielder Sandro will join the club at the end of the season, subject to a medical. The 21-year-old currently plays for Internacional in his home country and will head to Spurs at the end of their participation in the Copa Libertadores tournament. Sandro has made 73 appearances for the club and helped them to finish second in the Brazilian championship last season. Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp told reporters on Tuesday: ""It would be fantastic. The chairman has been dealing with it. I got a phone call this morning from the chairman saying that he thought we were close to doing it. ""Hopefully it will get done now and it will be a good signing. He is an outstanding young player. He is on the verge of the Brazilian team. He has already played for Brazil and captained the Under-18s, 19s and 21s. ""He is strong. He looks a very, very good player so I am looking forward to getting him here."" Tottenham are currently fourth in the English Premier League and if they finish there at the end of the season they will qualify for the money-spinning Champions League. Sandro made his debut for Brazil in a World Cup qualifier against Chile in September. He also led the Under-20 side to the South American Youth Championship in Venezuela in February 2009. Meanwhile, Tottenham's London rivals West Ham United have confirmed they are working on a bid with their local council to occupy the London Olympic Stadium after the games in 2012. The Hammers would play their Premier League games there while the stadium would also be used as a centre of sport in the community. Vice-chairman Karren Brady told the club's Web site: ""We want to grab this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to create a real, life-changing legacy -- not just for this part of London, but for the wider area as well.""","Tottenham agree a deal to sign Brazil international Sandro .

"(CNN) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has deployed troops to areas near the Colombian border and says he is reviewing plans for a potential war as tension between the two nations rises. ""Three nights ago I told the vice-president. It makes me sad, I confess, that I'm reviewing war plans,"" he said during a phone interview on the state-run VTV network. Special forces are moving to 10 districts near the Colombian border to be prepared in case Colombian President Alvaro Uribe issues an invasion order before he leaves office August 7, Chavez said Friday. Colombia and Venezuela are at odds over accusations that leftist rebels have found refuge in Venezuela. Colombia says it has photographic evidence of camps belonging to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia -- known by its Spanish abbreviation, FARC -- in Venezuela. Colombia made its case before the Organization of American States earlier this month and asked for international observers to be allowed into Venezuela to verify the presence of the guerrilla group. Venezuela denied the accusations, and in response broke off diplomatic ties with Colombia. On Friday, Chavez told VTV that the Colombian government's accusations ""have become a threat against our sovereignty, [against] our people and against the revolution."" Chavez said surveys by the Venezuelan National Guard have proven that rebel camps do not exist within the country's borders. He accused Colombian officials and right-wing paramilitary units of plotting his assassination, while the Colombian government has accused Chavez of supporting the rebels. Despite the escalating tensions, the Venezuelan leader on Friday also expressed hope of restoring relations as soon as Colombian president-elect Juan Manuel Santos takes office. He told VTV that he hoped to meet with Santos as soon as possible, but stressed that in the meantime, ""we won't be sucked into a war that is not ours.""","Chavez says he is reviewing war plans as tension with Colombia grows .

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Authorities in Nigeria have recovered 15 schoolchildren who were snatched by kidnappers earlier this week, a police spokesman said Friday. The children were rescued by police late Thursday in southeastern Nigeria's Abia state, according to Yeni Ajayi, a deputy National Police spokesman. He added that the four gunmen holding them escaped. The gunmen boarded a school bus carrying the nursery and elementary school children from Abayi International School on Monday and took them away. There were questions as to whether the children were foreigners because they attended the international school. The kidnappers contacted the children's school, located near the city of Aba and demanded 20 million naira -- around $130,000. Just after the incident, authorities said the bus driver and the school teacher who were on board were in police custody and helping security forces. Abia state is often referred to as the ""kidnapping capital"" of Nigeria since abductions occur there on a weekly basis. Schools, banks and businesses have closed in the area because of the rampant insecurity and dangers posed by kidnappers. Nigeria's President Goodluck Jonathan has condemned what he calls ""utterly callous and cruel kidnapping"" and ordered the Inspector-General of Police and heads of other security agencies ""to take all necessary steps to rescue the abducted children and return them safely to their parents."" But many such promises have been made in the past and insecurity in Abia has only worsened.","The kidnappings took place in southeastern Nigeria .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Doctors prescribed 2,360 pills to Anna Nicole Smith in the month before her death, a number that prosecutors told jurors Tuesday was evidence of a conspiracy to feed her drug addiction. ""You've all heard she was a strong gal,"" said Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Renee Rose during her closing argument Tuesday. ""But when she's medicated, she's way more compliant."" Rose argued that her boyfriend-lawyer Howard K. Stern conspired with two doctors to keep the reality TV star drugged much of the last three years of her life. On the judge's advice, Rose kept her closing arguments to four hours, less than the full day she had predicted she would use Tuesday. Defense lawyers began their closing arguments Tuesday afternoon, making it likely the jury would begin deliberations in the two-month trial by Thursday. In their closing arguments Monday, prosecutors portrayed the actress as a lying, drug-seeking, out-of-control addict who manipulated two doctors to write excessive prescriptions for dangerous drugs over the last three years of her life. Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney David Barkhurst used two Norman Rockwell portraits to show jurors ""what doctors should do,"" while painting Drs. Khristine Eroshevich and Sandeep Kapoor as physicians who fed Smith's addiction instead of treating her illnesses. Doctors have a responsibility to protect patients ""even from themselves,"" Barkhurst said. Stern and the doctors are accused of conspiring to feed the reality TV star and Playboy model's drug addiction and using false names to obtain the drugs. The defendants are not charged in Smith's February 2007 death, which a Florida medical examiner ruled was from an accidental overdose of a sleep aid, a lethal mix of prescription drugs and a viral flu. Judge Robert Perry has been highly critical of the prosecution's case, suggesting it was built from ""a dead celebrity and a bunch of low-level misdemeanors."" The judge said he decided to allow the case to go forward after another respected judge advised him to trust the jury system. Perry has questioned whether the prosecution has proved that Smith was an addict, as defined by California law, and not just dependent on drugs to relieve chronic pain. ""If she's being treated for pain, it's not illegal,"" Perry said last week. Barkhurst, the first of two prosecutors to deliver closing arguments, said that at some point during the last three years of Smith's life, Eroshevich and Kapoor were no longer treating Smith's pain, ""but were prescribing to treat her addiction."" ""There is not a single physical test done on Anna Nicole Smith during the time Dr. Kapoor is treating her,"" Barkhurst said.  He also said that Eroshevich kept no medical records of her care for Smith, but simply used her ""prescription pad power"" to provide controlled drugs to her. Both doctors crossed ethical lines by developing personal friendships with Smith, Barkhurst told jurors. ""A doctor can't be both a physician and a friend,"" Barkhurst said. He reminded jurors of photos shown earlier of Eroshevich naked with Smith in a hot tub at her Bahamas home months before her death. ""She is writing prescriptions to keep Anna Nicole euphoric, not to treat a medical condition,"" the prosecutor said. He also read entries from Kapoor's personal diary, written after he and Smith attended a gay pride event. ""I was making out with Anna, my patient, blurring the lines,"" Kapoor's diary said. Another diary entry was evidence Kapoor knew his prescriptions for Smith were illegal, Barkhurst said. ""I give her methadone, Valium. Can she ruin me?"" Evidence that Smith was an addict dates back to 1996, when she voluntarily entered the Betty Ford Clinic, he argued. Kapoor should have recognized that Smith was an addict when she first came to his office in April 2004 and asked for one of the most powerful painkillers available, Barkhurst said. ""Anna Nicole Smith liked Dilaudid,"" he said.  ""She asked for what she liked."" Kapoor gave her another prescription for Dilaudid six weeks later, when Smith complained of pain from two ribs broken in a May 27, 2004, Jet Ski accident. ""If she was on Dilaudid at the time she cracked her ribs, certainly she shouldn't be on a Jet Ski,"" Barkhurst said. Kapoor ordered no X-rays or tests and did not take the time to call another doctor who treated her the day of the accident, he said. Smith got Dilaudid from four different doctors that month, he said. A doctor who treated Smith at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in June 2006 testified that she concluded Smith was addicted to drugs, Barkhurst told jurors. When Dr. Natalie Maullin asked Kapoor then if Smith had any addiction issues, Kapoor laughed and said there have been some issues, Barkhurst said. Two charges against Stern were thrown out by Perry, who questioned the evidence that Stern, a lawyer, knew it was illegal to get drugs in multiple names. ""It has all the hallmarks of a kitchen sink prosecution,"" Perry said last week. ""It looks like the prosecution is throwing everything in with the hope that something will survive."" Perry hinted that if the defendants are found guilty, he would consider ""possible selective prosecution issues"" when sentencing them. During the trial, prosecutors showed a 13-minute video of Smith bathing with her infant daughter months before her death to support their argument that Smith's speech was slurred and her mind was groggy from drugs. Jurors were not allowed to see the video, which also shows Smith talking in a childlike manner during a birthday party for a 9-year-old girl. The defense does not deny that Smith took a lot of drugs, but it says the doctors were treating her for chronic pain that other doctors had also diagnosed. The prosecution's case was hampered by several key witnesses' recanting details of earlier statements, including a former nanny who said she never saw Stern injecting Smith with a needle.

"(CNN) -- After deliberating for about four hours over two days, a jury Tuesday convicted a 47-year-old man of capital murder in the deaths of three members of a Connecticut family in a 2007 home invasion. Steven Hayes was convicted on 16 of the 17 charges against him in connection with the deaths of Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her two daughters, including nine counts of murder and capital murder and four counts of kidnapping. The jurors acquitted him of an arson charge in the burning of the family's home. As the verdicts were read, Hayes stood at the defense table, looking down. Some members of the Petit family embraced, while others seemed close to tears. The killings took place in the New Haven suburb of Cheshire early on July 23, 2007. The home of Dr. William Petit, his wife, Hawke-Petit, and their two daughters was invaded in the middle of the night by Hayes and co-defendant Joshua Komisarjevsky, prosecutors say. Komisarjevsky will be tried separately. ""There is some relief, but my family is still gone,"" Petit told reporters after the verdict. ""It doesn't bring them back. It doesn't bring back the home that we had."" Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against Hayes. At the penalty phase, jurors will determine whether the mitigating evidence the defense is expected to present will outweigh the aggravating factors in favor of the death penalty. Judge Jon Blue set the penalty phase to begin October 18. Jurors deliberated about two hours on Monday. Before they received the case, prosecutor Michael Dearington laid out an elaborate timeline of events. ""I doubt you could have comprehended how horrendous this evidence would be,"" he told jurors. During the trial, Jeremiah Krob, a Connecticut prison officer, testified he overheard Hayes confess to another inmate that he killed Hawke-Petit. Hayes also reportedly wondered out loud whether Petit might have been in cahoots with his co-defendant, Komisarjevsky, because Petit had escaped. Hayes said that he had tied the father in the basement of the home and that he doubted he could have gotten loose without help from Komisarjevsky, Krob testified. Outside the courthouse, Petit told reporters: ""I really can't dignify that insinuation with a response. I think the evidence put on by the prosecution speaks for itself."" Connecticut State Police Detective Anthony Buglione, who interviewed Hayes after the crime, has testified the duo beat Petit bloody and left him in the basement. According to the testimony, the two men then went upstairs and found Hawke-Petit and 11-year-old Michaela Petit asleep in the master bedroom. After tying Hawke-Petit to her bed, they led the girl to her room, tied her to her bed and put a pillowcase over her head, Hayes told Buglione. They then found 17-year-old Hayley Petit in her room and did the same, he said. After finding evidence of a bank account containing $20,000 to $30,000, they decided to have the mother go to the bank in the morning and withdraw money from her account, Buglione testified. Hayes is accused of taking Hawke-Petit to the bank while Komisarjevsky allegedly stayed behind. When Hayes and Hawke-Petit returned with the money, the two men allegedly set the home on fire and fled. Inside the home, authorities said, Hawke-Petit, 48, was found raped and strangled. Her two daughters, one of whom had been sexually assaulted, died of smoke inhalation. Petit, the sole survivor, escaped to a neighbor's home. Public defender Thomas Ullmann conceded in the defense's opening statement that Hayes killed Hawke-Petit. But otherwise, he said, much of what happened is unclear. ""No one was supposed to be hurt,"" he said. ""What is known is that Steven Hayes kills and assaults Mrs. Petit. ... We concede much, but not all."" In Friday's closing arguments, Ullmann placed much of the blame on Hayes' alleged accomplice, Komisarjevsky, whom he called the mastermind of the home invasion. ""Just because the state has brought 17 charges doesn't mean he's guilty of all of them,"" Ullmann said of Hayes, though he conceded he couldn't explain why his client didn't leave the scene once things began to escalate. But, he said, ""Even in flight, Joshua Komisarjevsky was in control."" Dearington dismissed those statements in his rebuttal, saying Hayes ""was part of that whole plan to destroy this family, to take their money and to burn that house down."" In a police interview, Hayes said that his life ""sucked"" and that he had ""no money, no car, and not enough to eat."" ""Why didn't he leave? He didn't leave because of his desire for money,"" Dearington said. In Session's Michael Christian and Swetha Iyengar contributed to this report.","NEW: Father: ""My family is still gone""

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama worked behind closed doors to win support among key House Democrats for his health care reform plan Thursday, one day after urging Congress to hold a final up or down vote on the measure. The administration also ratcheted up its campaign against private health insurance companies, summoning a group of CEOs to the White House and asking them to justify recent rate increases. Senior Democrats, meanwhile, continued to give optimistic predictions about the fate of the president's top domestic priority. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Congress is ""on the brink of making very important history."" White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said he thinks the House of Representatives is on schedule to pass the Senate health care bill before Obama leaves for an overseas trip March 18. Asked to describe Obama's strategy for convincing wavering Democrats, Gibbs said the president is simply describing ""the benefits of the legislation"" and ""why it's important for our country."" ""I have confidence that [Congress will understand] what's good for them and good for America,"" Gibbs added. On Wednesday, Obama urged Congress to bring the yearlong debate on health care reform to a close. He argued that his nearly $1 trillion proposal is a compromise plan that combines the best ideas of Democrats and Republicans. He also came out in support of a legislative bypass known as reconciliation, which would allow changes to the health care bill to be passed by the Senate with only 51 votes, a simple majority. ""At stake right now is not just our ability to solve this problem but our ability to solve any problem,"" he said. ""The American people want to know if it's still possible for Washington to look out for their interests and their future. They are waiting for us to act."" Top Republicans have said repeatedly that Obama's proposal amounts to a government takeover of the private health care system that will do little to control spiraling medical inflation. In recent weeks, they have repeated their calls for the president to scrap his plan and start over. GOP leaders also fiercely oppose the use of reconciliation, arguing that it was never meant to be used for such a major policy change. Multiple Democratic sources have said the emerging consensus plan is for the House of Representatives to pass the Senate bill and send it to Obama. A package of changes that mirror the president's plan would then be passed through both chambers under reconciliation rules. Pelosi said Thursday that she feels very confident that the changes passed under reconciliation ""will satisfy [House] members' concerns about the Senate bill."" Democrats increasingly raised the possibility of using reconciliation after losing their 60-vote filibuster-proof Senate majority in January, when GOP Sen. Scott Brown won the Massachusetts Senate seat held by the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, a Democrat. Observers note, however, that it remains unclear exactly which health care provisions can be approved under reconciliation, which is reserved for legislation pertaining to the budget. Senate Republicans can also propose an unlimited number of amendments to bills brought up under the procedure. Another potential problem for Democratic leaders is abortion. House Democrats in favor of abortion restrictions have warned repeatedly that they cannot vote for the Senate health care bill. The bill that passed the House would prohibit abortion coverage in policies made available through health insurance exchanges to people receiving federal subsidies. The less restrictive Senate bill would allow individuals purchasing plans through the exchanges to pay for abortion coverage out of their own funds. Most observers do not believe that abortion provisions in the health care bills can be changed under the rules of reconciliation. Pelosi tried Thursday to assuage the concerns of abortion-rights opponents. ""If you believe that there should be no federal funding of abortion, and if you believe there should be no change in the [current federal] policy, and if you believe that we need health care all for Americans, we will pass the bill,"" she said. ""And we will pass the bill.""","White House steps up campaign against private health insurance companies .

"Washington (CNN) -- Johnny Bench, Tony LaRussa and Steve Carlton, their 1980s-style hair shoved under their caps, look forever young in a substantial baseball card collection that's missing an owner. Since June 24, the Metropolitan Police Department has been trying to find the rightful owner of well more than 500 cards, each carefully placed in a plastic protective sleeve. A visitor to East Potomac Park found the cache of cards in a grassy area and notified police, who combed through crime reports but have thus far struck out on identifying the owner. ""We don't know if it fell off the back of a car,"" Lt. Nicholas Breul said Wednesday, indicating it's his guess that they were stolen. Police publicized the find Wednesday and included photos of some of the collection. They aren't releasing all the information because they want to be sure whoever comes forward can provide extensive details before they turn them over. The Topps and Fleer cards are of Major League Baseball players from the 1980s and 1990s. Players include Reggie Smith, Gary Carter and Toby Harrah. Breul won't hazard a guess on their value, but he indicated some might be worth about $1. Of course, a few could be worth more. If no one successfully claims them, the cards may be auctioned and serious collectors would get a better handle on their worth. ""So much depends on condition,"" Breul told CNN. The department spokesman said he's not an avid baseball fan. After all, he grew up in Washington, which twice lost the Senators to other cities and whose Nationals have been dependable cellar-dwellers. He is friends with Boston Red Sox fans and has at least one connection with one of the finds. ""That Fred Lynn card is pretty cool,"" Breul said, referring to the outfielder who starred for the Sox in the '70s. Anyone with information or believes the set is theirs can contact the department's Public Information Office at (202) 727-4383 between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. ET Monday through Friday.

"Copiapo, Chile (CNN) -- The 33 miners trapped inside a Chilean mine since August 5 have been told for the first time that they could be stuck underground for as long as four months, the head of the rescue operation said Friday. But Andre Sougarret, the mines manager for the state mining company, and Chilean government representative Jimena Matos also said they are working on a ""Plan B,"" which could help speed up the rescue process. ""Last night, a third probe reached where the miners are and that probe, or the bore hole made by that probe, could form the basis of our plan B,"" said Sougarret, declining to offer specifics. Officials expect drilling on a rescue shaft, a process that workers have said could take four months to complete, to begin this weekend. Still, even under the best-case scenario, the trapped miners will be underground for quite some time -- posing a host of practical and psychological problems. To help solve them, Chilean officials are looking in unlikely places. An official at NASA, the U.S. space agency, said on Friday the organization has been asked by Chile to help provide nutritional and behavioral health support to the miners. A four-person team, including two physicians and a psychologist, are planning to go to Chile next week, said Michael Duncan, NASA's lead on the Chile effort. NASA has a long history in dealing with isolated environments and thinks experiences in space and underground are not too different, he said. ""It's an opportunity to us to bring the space-flight experience back down to the ground,"" said Duncan. The workers, trapped 2,300 feet below the surface, have been trying to keep their spirits -- and the spirits of their loved ones -- from flagging. They sent a video message to their families Thursday in which they expressed thanks for the efforts under way to free them and displayed occasional flashes of humor and patriotism. ""We know what you've all been doing for us,"" said one man. ""You haven't left us alone. We want to send applause to you."" At that, the men broke into applause. Throughout the 25-minute, high-definition video, one miner guided the hand-held camera ahead of him, its path illuminated by the light on his mining helmet. The video views were grainy and sometimes out of focus. The video showed the 50-square-meter (about 540-square-foot) living space occupied by the men since they were trapped by the collapse of a mine shaft. Some appeared heavily bearded, all of them were stripped to the waist. A thermometer showed 29.5 degrees Celsius, (about 85 degrees Fahrenheit), a little cooler than officials had estimated. Some of the men were standing, others were lying down. ""Oh, you're sleeping on a box-spring bed,"" joked one man to another, who is sprawled out on a pile of rocks. On a crate sat a set of dominoes; on a wall were two first-aid boxes. Nearby were two stretchers. One miner said to his family: ""Be calm. We're going to get out of here. And we thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your efforts."" At that, the other miners broke into applause again. The tenor of most of the comments was calm, though one man's emotion cut through. ""Thank you to everybody,"" he said. ""I send you a big hug in the name of our Lord."" As he spoke, his voice cracked. Out of the view of the camera, as one miner finished his message, another could be heard saying, ""Get us out of here soon."" Family members who saw the video in a private screening said their loved ones appeared thin, but healthy and in good spirits. Several said many of the relatives cried as they watched and listened. Doctors have given the miners advice about how to keep their limited living space clean: Portions of a 1-meter-high (3.3 feet), 40-meter-long (about 130 feet) shaft are being used as a latrine. It is connected to the main cabin, which is being used for sleeping, washing and praying. The men's sole lifeline to the outside world is a tube approximately 8 centimeters (3.2 inches) in diameter, through which food, water, clothing, video and radio equipment and whatever else is needed are stuffed. Health Minister Jaime Manalich told reporters Thursday that, on average, each man has lost 22 pounds (10 kilograms) since they became trapped three weeks ago, and dehydration remains a threat. But a survey of the men indicates that at least nine miners are still too overweight to fit through the proposed rescue shaft, he said.

"Biejing, China (CNN) -- Floods have killed at least 29 people in northeastern China this week and washed tons of chemical containers into the Songhua River, state media reported Friday. The death toll from the flood waters in Jilin province rose to 27 in Yongji county.  Two more people died in neighboring Shuangyang city, according to a statement from Jilin's civil affairs department,  Xinhua news agency reported. The flooding has forced more than 254,000 people from their homes and collapsed about 22,000 buildings, civil affairs said. On Wednesday, the rising water hit a chemical plant in Jilin and 7,000 containers washed into the Songhua River --  3,000 of which were filled with explosive chemicals,  Xinhua said. Emergency teams were mobilized to recover the spilled fluid. Authorities had recovered 1,500 containers by Thursday evening. Jilin is the latest province to be hit by fatal floods that have left 928 people dead and 477 missing nationwide, according to China's flood control and drought relief headquarters.","The floods in Jilin province kill 29 people .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration is preparing to notify Congress of plans to sell $60 billion of military equipment to Saudi Arabia, according to a U.S. defense official. The official, who would not be identified because the proposal has not yet been sent to Congress, described the deal as ""enormous."" ""We believe this is the largest of its kind in history,"" the official said. Congress would have to approve the deal. The proposed package includes 84 newly manufactured F-15/SA fighter aircraft; 70 upgraded aircraft, 70 Apache helicopters, 72 Black Hawk helicopters, and 36 AH-6 Little Bird helicopters. A number of bombs and missiles also are in the deal, including the Joint Direct Attack Munition, a satellite-guided bomb, as well as a laser-guided Hellfire missile variant and some advanced targeting technology. The Saudi arms effort is in large part directed at providing a modernized capability against Iran. ""This gives them a whole host of defensive and deterrent capabilities,"" the official explained. The official emphasized that nothing in the sale would change the qualitative edge that Israel seeks to maintain. A point reiterated by State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley. ""Suffice it to say that at the core of our policy is making sure that, you know, there is stability in the region and part of that stability is making sure that Israel has what it needs ... to be able to provide for its own security,"" Crowley said Monday. ""So the United States would do nothing that would upset that -- the current ... balance in the region."" The Obama administration hopes to send the proposed package to Capitol Hill no later than next week. The official emphasized it's not clear yet whether the Saudis would follow through to buy all of the weapons and aircraft in the package because they are continuing to evaluate their own financial concerns. Boeing Corp. has told the administration that if the entire package is sold, 77,000 company jobs would be ""involved,"" but there was no calculation on how many new jobs might be created over the five- to 10-year period of potential delivery, according to the official. The official also indicated the United States is discussing with the Saudi government additional sales of a ballistic missile defense system and more modern warships.","The $60 billion deal would include fighter planes, helicopters and high-tech bombs .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Opium production has dropped significantly in Afghanistan, in large part because of a plant infection in the country's war-torn south, a U.N. report said on Thursday. ""This is good news but there is no room for false optimism; the market may again become lucrative for poppy-crop growers so we have to monitor the situation closely,"" said Yury Fedotov, executive director of the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime. The development was detailed in the office's 2010 Afghan Opium Survey. Insurgents in Afghanistan have financed their operations through the opium trade. The report said the total 2010 production was estimated at 3,600 metric tons, down 48 percent from 2009. ""The decrease was largely due to a plant infection hitting the major poppy-crop growing provinces of Helmand and Kandahar particularly hard,"" the report said. ""Plant diseases are a normal occurrence all over the world. In Afghanistan, which produces 92 per cent of the world's opium, they can affect the poppy crop. The current strain attacks the roots of the plant, climbing up the stem and causing the opium capsule to wither away. These signs are similar to those observed in previous such outbreaks in the region,"" the report said. Prices of opium are rising after a decline from 2005, the report said. ""In the short run, the decline in opium production has pushed prices up. Despite the drop in overall production, the farm-gate income of opium farmers rose markedly. Now that opium is commanding high prices again, the gross income for farmers per hectare has increased by 36 per cent to $4,900. The report said opium cultivation remained stable with 98 percent of cultivation taking place in nine provinces in the south and west of the country.","A plant infection blamed for large drop in production, according to the U.N.

"(CNN) -- Nepalese authorities in Kathmandu seized ballot boxes Sunday, disrupting elections for Tibetans who were voting to elect a new prime minister and government in exile, officials said Monday. ""The administration intervened in the so-called election because Nepal's foreign policy does not allow any activities against any friendly neighboring countries,"" Nepal's Home Ministry spokesman Jaya Mukunda Khanal told CNN. Tibet is officially an autonomous part of China. Many Tibetan leaders advocate what they describe as a more genuine autonomy, while others seek independence. China rejects Tibetan claims of independence or greater autonomy and claims sovereignty over the area. An estimated 20,000 Tibetan exiles live in Nepal. Nepal maintains that Tibet is part of China, and does not allow any anti-Chinese activities on its soil. Khanal denied that there had been any instructions from the Chinese government to foil the election. According to a Home Ministry statement, 18 ballot boxes were seized and investigations are being carried out. No arrests were made, Kathmandu police Chief Ramesh Kharel told CNN. About 30 Nepalese police conducted the confiscation operation at two Kathmandu polling sites, according to a statement on the website of the Central Tibet Administration. But Thinley Gyatso, the regional Tibetan election commissioner in Nepal, said that authorities had given him permission to conduct the vote and that he is pressing the Nepalese government to return the ballot boxes, according to the Central Tibet Administration statement.

"Editor's Note: John Smoltz was a star pitcher for the Atlanta Braves and won the Cy Young Award as the National League's best pitcher in 1996. He is second all-time with 15 post-season wins and will be doing color commentary on TBS's baseball playoff coverage that gets under way Wednesday. Baseball's post-season starts Wednesday with six of the eight playoff teams facing off in best-of-five series. First up, the Texas Rangers travel to St. Petersburg to take on the Tampa Bay Rays. Later Wednesday, the defending National League champion Philadelphia Phillies host the Cincinnati Reds, and the defending World Series champion New York Yankees open a defense of their title against the Twins in Minnesota. The San Francisco Giants and Atlanta Braves open their National League Division series on Thursday. John Smoltz, who was an eight-time all-star and pitched in the major leagues for more than 20 years, spoke to CNN about what to watch when you tune in the games. CNN: Who are half-dozen or so players that even the casual baseball fan will enjoy watching in the playoffs? John Smoltz: A couple of the young players come to mind. In the National League, we have Buster Posey, a rookie catcher handling a veteran pitching staff for the Giants. It will be interesting to see how he does. In that same series, Jason Heyward from the Braves, a young phenom, is in the playoffs in his first season. It doesn't happen too often that two rookies are expected to lead their teams like Posey and Heyward are. For people who don't know a lot about the Cincinnati Reds, Joey Votto is an exciting player who has put up incredibly great offensive numbers (.324 batting average, 37 home runs, 113 RBI). It will be interesting to see how he fares against Philadelphia's three-headed pitching monster (star pitchers Roy Halladay, Roy Oswalt and Cole Hamels). Carl Crawford of Tampa Bay is an exciting player who is fun to watch. He can steal bases, hit for power and plays tremendous defense in the outfield. There's going to be the question mark for the Yankees: Can Andy Pettitte return from his injury to dominance of the post-season where he's won more games than any other pitcher? [Smoltz is second.] . And Minnesota has all kinds of great stories. Their starting pitcher in the first game, Francisco Liriano, was coming off an injury, and in spring training didn't even know if he'd make the roster. And here [he] is starting game one. CNN: There were some blown calls by umpires last post-season. Will we see more use of replay? Smoltz: There won't be any more replays being used [than last year]. Replay will only be used for home-run calls, fair or foul. My opinion is eventually we get to the point where at least in post-season, replay is used only when a run would be affected. So if there's a runner on third, and on an infield chopper, a guy looks like he is safe but they call him out, I think that would be reviewable since a run [was] scored. A trapped ball with two outs and a man on third would be the same thing. Those are the kind of things that could really affect the outcome of a game and would be a reviewable component if a run crosses home plate. That's why they do it for a home run, because a run is affected. CNN: Has the style of the game changed in recent years, either due to more stringent steroid testing or for other reasons? Smoltz: The style of the game has drastically changed. It's become a more specialized game, and what I mean by that is more pitchers are being used per game, which makes hitting that much more difficult because you're facing specialist guys who can throw 90 to 96 miles per hour coming out of the bullpen. That has been a big component that has changed strategy. Starting pitchers don't pitch as long anymore, and relief pitchers pitch to one, two or three batters at a time. I also think the confidence of the hitters has been impacted by the steroid stuff and has contributed to the lack of home runs. CNN: Does home field matter? Smoltz: I would argue it always matters. I know statistics may show differently, but home field should matter. Imagine if in football you always got the ball last in the fourth quarter no matter what the score was. That would have an impact. In baseball, you bat last, which means there should be a strategic advantage, not to mention your home-team crowd should serve you well. The best-of-five series [the round one format] is more of a coin flip. The first game of a best-of-five means a lot more than a game one in best-of-seven [The format for the league championship and World Series]. There is more time to recover in a best-of-seven than a best-of-five. The pressure in best-of-five reduces the chances of [the] best team winning. CNN: Which manager can most directly impact the game and steal a win for his team? Smoltz: Bobby Cox of the Braves has done his greatest managing job of his career. Just getting there has been an incredible testament to his patience and will and ability to put his team in position. Joe Maddon of the Rays has uncanny and well-thought-out theories that he applies and has his team do. ... Without knowing a whole lot, I'd give the nod to Joe Maddon. CNN: What would surprise you most this post-season? Smoltz: The Atlanta Braves winning their series against the Giants, just because they ran out of gas and have sustained too many injuries. That and Cincinnati knocking off Philadelphia, who is heavily favored. CNN: What's your prediction on who wins the World Series? Smoltz: Philadelphia beats Tampa Bay in a close series.","John Smoltz says to keep eye on young players leading their teams in baseball playoffs .

"Washington (CNN) -- Latino support for Democratic candidates remains strong, with 65 percent of registered Hispanic voters saying they plan to vote for the Democrat in their congressional district in next month's midterm elections, the Pew Hispanic Center said in a report Tuesday. But Latino voters appear less motivated than other voters. About one-third of Latino voters say they have given this election ""a lot of thought,"" while half of U.S. registered voters say they have, Pew said. In a further challenge to Democrats, the nationwide Pew poll found that Republican Latino registered voters may be more likely to vote than Democrats. About 44 percent of Latino Republicans say they have given the election quite a lot of thought compared with 28 percent of Latino Democrats, the Pew report said. ""This partisan gap is consistent with survey findings of the full population of registered voters,"" said the report by Mark Hugo Lopez, associate director of the Pew Hispanic Center. The study finds that while two-thirds of Latino voters support the Democrats, 22 percent back the Republican candidate. Latinos overwhelmingly supported the Democrats in the 2008 presidential election, with Barack Obama getting 67 percent of the Hispanic vote and John McCain garnering 31 percent. Likewise, the report said, 69 percent of Latino voters supported Democratic candidates in 2006 congressional races while 30 percent supported Republican hopefuls. ""Even in 2004, a year when Republicans won a greater share of the Latino vote in the presidential election than at any time since the 1980s, nearly six in 10 (58 percent) Latino voters supported Democrats John Kerry and John Edwards,"" the report said. Latino support for Obama remains strong, the survey found. Nearly two-thirds of Latino registered voters said they approve of his job performance, well above the 47 percent of all U.S. registered voters who say they approve. ""Yet when asked about the effect of his administration's policies on Hispanics, Latino registered voters are divided,"" Pew said. ""More than half (51 percent) say his policies have had no effect on Latinos, while one in four (26 percent) say they have been helpful to Latinos and 13 percent say they have been harmful."" The study also reveals that the Democratic Party continues to hold a large advantage in party identification among Latino registered voters. Sixty-two percent of Latino registered voters said they identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party, Pew said, while 25 percent say the same for the Republican Party. A reason for the support for Democrats may be that the party is seen as having more concern for Latinos. ""Nearly half (47 percent) of Latino registered voters say this about the Democratic Party -- down from 55 percent in 2008, but similar to the share on this question expressed by Latinos for much of the past decade,"" Pew said. ""In contrast,"" the report said, ""very few see the Republican Party as more concerned about Latinos than the Democratic Party -- just 6 percent of all Latino registered voters and 18 percent of Republican Latino registered voters say this."" The survey also found that Latinos are less negative than other voters about the direction of the country. Fifty-nine percent of Latino registered voters said they are dissatisfied with the country's direction, while 73 percent of all U.S. registered voters say the same, Pew said. Latino support could be significant for both major parties because Hispanics represent a growing portion of the electorate. According to a Pew Hispanic Center analysis of Census Bureau data, Latino voters constituted 7.4 percent of all voters nationwide in 2008, up from 6 percent in 2004. Tuesday's report is titled ""Latinos and the 2010 Elections: Strong Support for Democrats; Weak Voter Motivation."" The findings for the report came from a national bilingual telephone survey of 1,375 Latinos ages 18 or older, including 618 registered voters, conducted from August 17 through September 19 by the Pew Hispanic Center. The sampling margin for the whole sample is plus or minus 3.3 percentage points. The Pew Hispanic Center is a nonpartisan research organization that does not take positions on policy issues. It is part of the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan institute based in Washington that is funded by The Pew Charitable Trusts, a Philadelphia-based public charity.","Pew study: Nearly two-thirds of Latinos support Democrats; 22 percent back GOP .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Attacks in Pakistan on trucks carrying fuel for NATO troops in Afghanistan damaged about two dozen trucks and killed two people Friday, authorities said. Militants torched dozens of supply trucks in the southern Pakistani province of Sindh Friday morning, police said. No one was hurt, but 25 of 27 trucks were damaged, officials said. On Friday night, attackers with automatic weapons struck a NATO supply truck, killing two people and damaging contents, Pakistani police said. Saeed Ahmed, a senior police official in the Khuzdar district of Baluchistan, said the truck was apparently separated from a convoy heading to Afghanistan. The Friday morning attack took place in the Shikarpur district when four militants used fire crackers and petrol bombs to damage the trucks, said Muhammad Hanif, a senior police official in the district. The trucks carry crude, diesel and petrol for NATO troops in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, NATO convoys were still barred Friday from going into Afghanistan through the Torkham Gate checkpoint. The supply route to Afghanistan has been closed by the Pakistani government after fighting that led to the deaths of three Pakistani soldiers, and a military spokesman said Thursday that United States is hopeful the situation is only temporary. Pakistan banned NATO supply convoys from entering Afghanistan after the deaths of the three soldiers, whom the government says were killed in Pakistani territory during fighting between NATO troops and militants, according to a military official from the NATO-led command in Afghanistan. Lt. Col. John Dorrian, an ISAF spokesman, said the Torkham Gate in the Khyber Agency has been closed since about midday on Thursday. Chaman Gate, the other border crossing between Pakistan and Afghanistan, remains open. ""We don't think it's a very serious problem,"" Dorrian said. ""It's a throroughfare we use a lot so it is significant. But we can work around it."" ""We do expect these matters to be resolved."" Supply convoys are all-important for the Afghan war effort, and officials from NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) were trying to persuade Pakistan to lift the ban. Coalition forces rely heavily on convoys from Pakistan to bring in supplies and gear. Torkham Gate is one of the main ports of entry for material coming into the war zone. But it is not the only way of getting supplies in. Khyber Agency is one of the seven districts in Pakistan's tribal region. About half the cargo that flows into Afghanistan comes in via one of the two gates from Pakistan, the Defense Department says. Another 30 percent uses two major routes through Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, one via Russia and the other via the Caucasus. The remaining 20 percent -- mostly sensitive items like weapons, ammunition and other critical equipment -- comes in by air.

India had resumed on 95-0 in reply to Sri Lanka's 642-4 declared, and Sehwag raced from his overnight 64 to 99 before being denied his 21st Test century when he was stumped by wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardene off the bowling of Suraj Randiv. The offspinner is making his debut following the retirement of world record-holder Muttiah Muralitharan after Sri Lanka's win in the opening match of three in Galle.

"(CNN) -- Deposed Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya said Thursday night he has rejected a proposal by the man who replaced him after a June coup that they both resign and make way for a third person to take over. Ousted Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya faces reporters Thursday at Brazil's Embassy in Tegucigalpa. The proposal was made in person by a delegate for de facto President Roberto Micheletti, Zelaya said in an interview with CNN en Español. Zelaya said the unnamed delegate visited him Wednesday night in the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, where he has been holed up since secretly returning to the country Monday. ""This is not acceptable,"" Zelaya said about the proposal, adding that it would just mean replacing one leader put into power by a coup with another non-elected president. Earlier Thursday, Zelaya said in an interview with CNN's Rick Sanchez that he never lost the title of president though he was removed from power in the June 28 coup. ""I am the president of Honduras and I'll stay here in the Brazilian embassy as long as it takes,"" he said.  Watch Zarrella report on the situation in Honduras » . Zelaya told CNN en Español that he no help from any outside nations in returning to Honduras. He said reports by Brazilian officials that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez helped him are ""absolutely false."" Only Honduran citizens helped him, Zelaya said. He said earlier this week the trip took 15 to 16 hours. The ousted leader also said conditions had improved at the embassy in the past day. He had complained earlier in the week that Micheletti's government had shut off electricity and water to the embassy and was impeding food deliveries. Authorities had said they turned off power to the embassy and surrounding area to discourage looting, but Micheletti has said that pro-Zelaya protesters at the embassy short-circuited the power themselves. Micheletti again denied on Thursday turning off the power. Micheletti told Sanchez his government is not in contact with Brazilian officials, but said Zelaya would not be removed from the embassy. ""We are serious people,"" he said. ""We're going to let him stay wherever he wants."" Earlier this week, Micheletti said Zelaya would be arrested and face charges for violating the constitution if he left the embassy. ""President Zelaya should present himself before the tribunals of justice in our country where he has charges against him,"" Micheletti said in a Wednesday interview with CNN en Español. Zelaya has denied violating the constitution. Asked whether officials would allow CNN to enter the embassy to interview Zelaya, Micheletti said, ""Please, please. I beg you. Come down here. But don't just stay only in the Brazilian embassy. Go to all over the country and find out the real true country. Please, come."" CNN reporter John Zarrella said previously that authorities would not let him into the embassy to interview Zelaya. A nationwide curfew was lifted Wednesday, but a tight security cordon remained in the area around the embassy. Micheletti said police were stationed there because people inside the embassy requested the protection. ""We are not impeding the exit nor the entrance of absolutely anybody,"" Micheletti said. Zelaya said in the interview with CNN en Español that he been meeting with political and religious leaders who visited him at the embassy. Micheletti has maintained that Zelaya was not removed in a coup, but in a constitutional transfer of power.","Former leader returned to country this week, has been staying in embassy .

"(CNN)   -- Chelsea extended their lead in the English title race with a 2-0 win over London neighbors Arsenal at Stamford Bridge on Sunday while the misery continues for 18-time champions Liverpool. Goals in either half from Didier Drogba and Alex leave Chelsea four points clear of big-spending Manchester City. They beat Newcastle 2-1 in an earlier kickoff while Liverpool went down 2-1 at home to newly-promoted minnows Blackpool . Charlie Adam's penalty and a fine goal from Luke Varney put Ian Holloway's men two up by halftime. Sotirios Kyrgiakos pulled a goal back in the second half but Roy Hodgson's strugglers could not force an equalizer and they stay in the bottom three. The match was preceded by a protest against the team's American owners George Gillett and Tom Hicks and by the finish the fans were even more disillusioned. To add to their misery, star striker Fernando Torres limped off after just 10 minutes with a groin injury and it was the signal for Blackpool to claim three points with an attacking approach which stunned the hosts. Varney was clumsily upended by England international Glen Johnson to concede a penalty and Adam easily beat Pepe Reina from the spot. And as half-time approached, Varney finished off a superb move to beat Reina. Kyrgiakos scored with a strong header from a Steven Gerrard free kick to give Liverpool hope and Joe Cole came close to an equalizer, but the final whistle was greeted by jeers for Hodgson and his team. ""Their great result is our nightmare result,"" he acknowledged. ""It is a very bad day and there is nothing I can say. ""At the moment things look bleak and really bad and it is difficult for me to put a bright face upon it,"" he told gathered reporters. Later, Chelsea maintained their recent dominance of Arsenal with a vital victory, Drogba putting them ahead just before the break after the the visitors had the better of the early play. He backheeled Ashley Cole's low cross into the net for his 13th goal against Arsene Wenger's side in 11 starts. Defender Alex sealed the three points with a powerful 25 meter free-kick in the 85th minute to hand the Gunners their second straight league defeat. They are tied on points with north London rivals Tottenham in fourth and fifth positions, seven points behind Chelsea with seven games played. Manchester City are up to second after their victory over a spirited Newcastle. They took the lead through a Carlos Tevez penalty after Mike Williamson pulled down the Argentina international. Newcastle lost Hatem Ben Arfa to a suspected broken leg after a Nigel de Jong challenge, but drew level through a sharp shot from Jonas Gutierrez. Substitute Adam Johnson scored the winner for City in the second half with an equally fine strike. Manchester United are in third place in the early standings, five points behind Chelsea, after their 0-0 draw at Sunderland on Saturday. In other news on Sunday, former England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson was confirmed as new manager of struggling second-flight side Leicester City.

"(CNN) -- Justin Gatlin made it three wins from three races sinces his return to competitive athletics with victory in a 100 meters race in Tallinn, Estonia, on Sunday. The 2004 Olympic champion, who is returning to action after a four-year ban for failing a drugs test, clocked a time of 10.17 seconds -- running into a headwind -- to beat fellow-American Rubin Williams. The 28-year-old Gatlin, who won two races at a meeting in Rakvere, Estonia, on Tuesday, is having to compete at smaller venues because he is still banned from some of the larger meetings. ""I am very glad with the result. My aim was to be better than at the last competition and I bettered that today by seven hundreths of a second,"" he told the AFP news agency. ""I am dedicating myself fully to sport now and plan to return stronger next season,"" Gatlin added. Despite the run, Gatlin has admitted he still has some way to go before he can rival the likes of Usain Bolt, Tyson Gay and Asafa Powell once again. ""I am taking my return at the moment with a modest aim - the only aim I have in front of me is to be better than last time at every competition,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Here's a reason to be hopeful if you ever find yourself stuck on a desert island: sending a message in a bottle could actually work. Just ask Corey Swearingen. A teenager in Ireland recently found the bottle and message he tossed off the Florida coast last year. ""I was excited and amazed that my bottle traveled all the way across the Atlantic Ocean,"" said Swearingen, 18. But Swearingen's message wasn't an SOS. It was part of an experiment in his marine science class at Florida's Melbourne High School that started 16 months ago. ""The goal was to basically see how the ocean currents work and how the Gulf Stream flows, and eventually it landed in Ireland,"" he said. Swearingen says 17-year-old Adam Flannery and his father made the discovery. ""He was walking along the shore, and he saw the bottle and opened it,"" Swearingen said. ""The message said, 'Please do not throw this away. This is a science experiment.'"" The note directed the pair to contact science teacher Ethan Hall, which they did. By this time, Swearingen had graduated from high school and was attending Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, Florida. Hall tracked him down through Facebook and sent him a message with the incredible news. Swearingen said he had yet to speak with the Irish duo who found the bottle, but was looking forward to hearing their take on the find. This is not the first time Hall's experiment has proven successful, according to Swearingen. People in Georgia, South Carolina and Rhode Island have discovered bottles from other students in Hall's class. Still, Swearingen didn't expect anyone would ever find his bottle. But he said the fact that it travelled thousands of miles ensured he learned a lesson from the experiment -- more than a year after taking part in it.

"(CNN) -- After Haiti's devastating earthquake, Georges Nader picked up Hector Hyppolite's oil-on-cardboard painting like a father would a wounded child. He could barely hold back his tears. ""Vase et Fleurs,"" glorious in its art naif simplicity, lay before him like a complicated jigsaw puzzle. Pieces were frazzled, some were even missing. Like so many other things in Haiti, the painting by one of Haiti's foremost artists was gone. A masterpiece lost, and with it a part of Haiti's history. No one would ever be able to put it together, Nader believed, as he fished through a demolished museum in Port-au-Prince that housed 12,000 pieces of art collected by his family. Each told the history and aspirations of a people who survived hardship and expressed themselves through painting and sculpture. With few functioning institutions or the kinds of buildings and monuments found in wealthier nations, depictions of sun and sea, people and animals by untrained artists -- some infused with the spiritual traditions of voodoo culture -- came to serve as Haiti's collective memory. Hyppolite, a voodoo priest and self-taught artist, painted with his fingers and with brushes made of chicken feathers. On Friday, Nader will stand again before Hyppolite's 1946 still life, its brilliant hues brought back to life by conservators working with the Smithsonian Institution. ""I think it's a miracle,"" Nader said. The painting is one of two restored works of art that is part of a larger show of 50 pieces created by Haitian artists -- the other rescued piece is ""Beau Reve"" by Celestin Faustin. ""Saving Grace: A Celebration of Haitian Art"" was organized by Affirmation Arts and curated by leading Haitian art historian Gerald Alexis. Alexis, like his longtime friend Nader, said the exhibit meant the world to him, a potent symbol of Haiti's rebirth, especially amid cries that recovery efforts after the earthquake has been too slow. ""This is the identity of the Haitian people,"" Alexis said. ""If we let this go, the next generation in Haiti will not know where they came from. It was a duty we had to fulfill."" In the immediate aftermath of earthquake, Nader and other art collectors in Haiti rescued thousands of pieces from the rubble that might have been forever lost. In just one room of his museum, he salvaged 1,000 pieces -- 70 percent needed restorative work. It was hard to quantify the loss, Nader said, because unlike in the United States, Haiti lacked a plethora of museums and galleries. Much of the nation's treasure existed in private homes, in private collections like the one his father built when he began collecting decades ago. No one knew for certain how many pieces were lost. As the second floor of his gallery transformed into a hospital ward for art, Nader was determined to make them all well again. He and Alexis began making phone calls, knocking on doors. It would take people with tremendous expertise to perform intricate surgery on delicate paintings and objects to make them whole again. They found a partner at the Smithsonian and the result was the Cultural Recovery Centre, which recently opened in conjunction with the Haitian government in the hills of Port-au-Prince. Haiti's cultural heritage, like Africa's lions in the wild, were endangered. The center's mission was to protect that heritage. Richard Kurin, under-secretary for history, art and culture at the Smithsonian, said it would have been unconscionable to leave art under the rubble. He said the recovery center is ""magically"" restoring thousands of pieces that were damaged. The center is also training Haitians how to conserve. A course in September taught 26 participants how to identify deterioration agents, apply first aid treatment, prepare and respond to emergencies and create safe storage spaces for collections. ""I think we look at the restoration of art as the restoration of hope,"" he said. ""By restoring the past you are giving people access to their heritage."" Marla Goldwasser, the director of Affirmation Arts in New York admitted she didn't know much about Haitian art before she took on the ""Saving Grace"" exhibit. But the gallery wanted to make a contribution to Haiti's recovery. ""We wanted to give Haitian art, the Haitian people, a voice,"" she said about ""Saving Grace,"" the first such show of Haitian art in the United States in over a decade. Many of the pieces have previously not been seen outside Haiti. Nader hopes those who relish the visual feast will gather an understanding of the vital role that art plays in Haitian society. And why it is incumbent on Haitians to bring back what an earthquake buried last January.","A still life painting by Haitian artist Hector Hyppolite was damaged in the earthquake .

"(CNET)  -- The company paid to treat people to free newspapers in London, lighted the Empire State Building in Windows' colors and draped Toronto's CN Tower with a 300-foot banner -- all part of a massive $300 million ad campaign that accompanied the product's arrival. Windows 95, which was separate from the company's business-oriented Windows NT product, added a number of features over its predecessors including better network support, the ability to send faxes (yes, there was a time when that was a big deal) along with basic audio recording, audio playback, and video playback tools. Features now thought of as core parts of Windows, such as the start menu and taskbar, also made their debut with Windows 95. Plus, it just looked a whole lot better graphically and was far more stable than past consumer versions of Windows. Internet Explorer debuted around the same time, but was sold separately as part of Microsoft's Plus Pack for Windows 95. It was eventually bundled in directly with the operating system in an update to Windows 95 released the following year. By the time Windows 95 was finally ushered off the market in 2001, it had become a fixture on computer desktops around the world. ""If you look at Windows 95, it was a quantum leap in difference in technological capability and stability,"" Gartner analyst Neil MacDonald said at that time. A decade and a half after Windows 95 hit the market, though, one question looms large for Windows: Are all its best days in the past? Clearly it was a different time and Microsoft might be hard pressed to capture that kind of consumer attention no matter what it did. But, never mind the long lines, will Microsoft be able to continue to sell Windows at the price and volume it has? It's one of the most important questions facing Microsoft as a company. While the company has expanded far beyond its Windows roots, Windows and Office remain the engine driving the vast majority of the company's profits even as it looks to cell phones, search, and online services to augment its mainstay businesses. At the moment, the Windows business is doing quite well, with Windows 7 selling at an impressive clip. Indeed Windows 7 is selling far faster than Windows 95 did in its early days, though that's as much a testament to how large the PC market is as anything else. The longer-term question is whether Windows can outpace what I call the generic web experience. In the coming years, smartbooks, tablets, cell phones, Netbooks and shapes we probably haven't thought of will all be capable of delivering the web, which is for many people their main use of a PC. For Windows to be as relevant on Windows 95's 20th anniversary as it is today, the company will have had to manage to evolve the operating system significantly. I see a few ways this can happen, but none is a sure thing. First, Microsoft (or a third-party software maker) can develop a new killer app that only runs on Windows. It's been a long time since this happened, but certainly it's not impossible. New user interfaces can also be added. Touch is already there, as is voice control to some degree, but gesture recognition such as that found in Kinect could pave the way for new uses. Second, it could evolve Windows and Windows Live to offer a dramatically better way of doing the same tasks that most people do on the Web. Sure, we can manage our photos and music on the Web today and that is getting easier. However, tapping local storage and graphics, Microsoft has the potential to offer a better way and, with the latest version of Windows Live, is trying to do so. Third, Microsoft could enhance the value of Windows by having a browser that is demonstrably superior to non-Windows rivals. This appears to be a tall order, given that Internet Explorer, while still leading in market share, has been well behind rivals when it comes to being seen as the technical leader. For the record, this challenge is not just the one facing Microsoft. It's also the one facing Apple's Mac business. And while Microsoft must justify the $100 or so premium that it charges for Windows, Apple commands an even higher premium when comparing the Mac to one of these ""generic Web"" devices. But Apple also has another entrant in the game -- a viable alternative Web experience delivered in the form of the iPad. Microsoft, at least so far, appears to have only Windows, in its various flavors. © 2010 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- A Georgia man suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease says he wants to die by having his organs harvested rather than wait for his degenerative nerve ailment to kill him. Garry Phebus has been battling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as the disease is formally known, since 2008. The 61-year-old told HLN's ""Prime News"" on Thursday that the diagnosis is ""a death sentence, positively, no questions asked,"" and he wants do donate his organs while he still can. ""If people have their legs cut off or their wife left them and they commit suicide, it's another story. They still have a life ahead of them. But I do not,"" he said. And for people waiting for transplants, ""There's nothing greater than for a family member to receive an organ so they can watch their family grow up."" Lou Gehrig's disease attacks the nerves in the brain and spinal cord, affecting voluntary muscle control. In its later stages, the disease can leave sufferers paralyzed but fully conscious and alert. Phebus lives in White, Georgia, about 50 miles north of Atlanta. He conceded his decision is ""not for everyone,"" but said his family supports him -- a statement backed up with some qualifications by his daughter, Kerri Wilkinson. ""We kind of said, 'OK, well, let's not do this at this very second,' but to find out more about it,"" Wilkinson said. But she said that when her father's disease ""gets to the point where he's lost his pride or become humiliated in how he's having to suffer and the indignities ... we're not going to have an issue with that."" About 5,600 Americans a year are diagnosed with the disease, according to the ALS Association, a nonprofit group that advocates for more research on the disease. Those diagnosed typically live two to five years. But some, like famed Cambridge University physicist Stephen Hawking, survive for decades. Phebus' offer is ""admirable, and our heart goes out to him,"" Leigh Vinocur, an emergency medicine physician at the University of Maryland, told HLN. ""But 10 percent of people can live 20 years with this disease."" Vinocur said what Phebus wants to do amounts to physician-assisted suicide, a practice legal in only three U.S. states -- Oregon, Washington and Montana. And in those states, patients who seek to end their lives are typically in the last stages of a terminal disease. ""We donate organs in patients that, say, are brain dead or have terminal events,"" she said. Most doctors ""would have a problem"" with what Phebus wants to do, because ""at this point, he's fairly healthy."" ""I can't picture any states essentially putting, right now, a relatively healthy man under anesthesia, taking out vital organs like his heart and taking him off the ventilator,"" Vinocur said. And ALS is unlikely to harm the organs most likely to be used for transplants unless some sort of related infection strikes them, she said. Phebus has also taken his appeal online. In a video posted on the website YouTube, he argues that 90,000 people a year die waiting for organ transplants, and compares his situation to a soldier in a foxhole throwing himself on a grenade to save his comrades. ""I am not suicidal,"" he says. ""I just know that it is a matter of time before I die and wish to do a good thing for those people who have a good life expectancy""","Garry Phebus says he's under a ""death sentence""

"(CNN)  -- Liverpool shrugged off conceding an early goal to beat Turkish side Trabzonspor 2-1 and qualify for the group stages of the Europa League with a 3-1 aggregate victory. Minus star players Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres, Liverpool saw their 1-0 first leg advantage wiped out in just four minutes in Turkey when Colombian international Teofilo Gutierrez put Trabzonspor ahead. But Roy Hodgson's side drew level seven minutes from time as Trabzonspor's Giray Kacar turned a Glen Johnson cross into his own net. Dirk Kuyt, at fault for the first goal, then added as second in the 88th minute when goalkeeper Onur Kivrak could only push out Joe Cole's shot into the Dutchman's path. ""A lot of people have said a lot of things about my future, but for me it is at Liverpool. I like it here at the club and I want to stay here and win things,"" Kuyt told Sky Sports. He has been linked with a reunion with former Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez at Inter Milan. It was a welcome boost for Liverpool after their 3-0 thrashing by Manchester City, who also reached the group stages with a 2-0 home win over Romanian side FC Timisoara at Eastlands, going through 3-0 on aggregate. Shaun Wright-Phillips and Dedryck Boyata scored the goals for City. But there was more disappointment for a third English Premier League side as Aston Villa, thrashed 6-0 at the weekend by Newcastle, lost 3-2 at home to Austrian side Rapid Vienna. Villa went out of the competition to the same opponents last year and had expected to reverse that result after drawing 1-1 away in the first leg. Juventus, who like Liverpool and Villa are former European champions, eased through with a 1-0 home win over Sturm Graz of Austria in Turin after leading 2-1 from the away leg. But it was a disastrous night for Scottish clubs with Celtic crashing 4-0 away to FC Utrecht with Ricky van Wolfswinkel scoring a hat-trick. Celtic had led 2-0 from the first leg. Dundee United lost out to Greek side AEK Athens and Motherwell exited to Odense of Denmark.","Liverpool concede early goal in Turkey but beat Trabzonspor to reach Europa League .

"(CNN) -- Spanish champions Barcelona have announced they've agreed a deal to sign Javier Mascherano from Liverpool. The Argentina international asked to be sold in July and has recently been left out of Liverpool's squad as his drawn out move neared completion. Mascherano is now expected to fly to Barcelona this weekend to put the finishing touches to a transfer believed to be in the region of $27 million. A statement on Barcelona's official website read: ""FC Barcelona and Liverpool FC have reached agreement in principle for the transfer of Javier Mascherano, who will join the club for the next four seasons. ""The agreement was reached after considerable effort from the club over the last few hours and the willingness and desire of the player to make the move. ""FC Barcelona will give more details of the operation once the player has gone through his medical and the transfer is definitive. Javier Mascherano is expected to arrive in Barcelona this weekend."" Mascherano played in Liverpool's opening English Premier League fixture with Arsenal, but did not feature in either of the club's next two games, as he tried to push through the deal. He was signed from West Ham in January 2007 by former Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez -- now in charge at European champions Inter Milan. New Liverpool coach Roy Hodgson had set a deadline of Sunday for the deal to be finalized, as the two clubs haggled over a fee. Liverpool also confirmed the deal on their website: ""Liverpool Football Club have agreed terms for the transfer of Javier Mascherano to FC Barcelona.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- The Israeli Supreme Court has upheld the deportation of Nobel Peace Prize winner Mairead Maguire, who had tried to visit Israel and the Palestinian territories last week, a spokeswoman for the Israeli judiciary said Monday. Maguire, of Ireland, was held at Ben-Gurion International Airport's detention facility while she appealed Israel's refusal to allow her into the country. She landed there Tuesday with a delegation of other high-level women's rights activists from around the world, the Israeli Foreign Ministry said, but was denied entry because of her participation in efforts to run the Israeli blockade of the Palestinian territory of Gaza, the Israeli Foreign Ministry said. ""Mairead Maguire is one of the most nonviolent people I know,"" said Jody Williams, a fellow Nobel laureate who attended the hearing at the high court. ""In fact, we often have sharp words with each other because she is so nonviolent, and I am a tad more passionate."" Williams, who won the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize for her work to ban land mines, and Maguire are co-founders of the Women's Peace Initiative. Williams was also part of the delegation of women's rights activists that traveled to the Mideast. Maguire was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1976 for her efforts to end sectarian violence in Northern Ireland. The delegation planned to travel to Jerusalem, Haifa, Nazareth, Ramallah, Hebron and Bil'in to learn from and highlight the work of female peace builders. ""There will be peace in this country, I believe it, but only when Israel ends apartheid and the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people,"" Maguire told reporters before Monday's hearing. Maguire was aboard the MV Rachel Corrie, an Irish cargo ship that set sail for Gaza in June despite the Israeli blockade. The Israeli navy seized the ship before it reached Palestinian-controlled Gaza, and its passengers were deported. Those aboard the Rachel Corrie say the ship was seized in international waters, but Israel says it took the ship in Israeli territory and told those aboard they would not be allowed to return to Israel. ""She does not believe she has done anything wrong,"" Williams said. ""When she was on the Rachel Corrie with the flotilla, it was attacked in international waters. She was dragged to Israel, and then they say she can't come back to Israel. It was not her intention to end up there in the first place."" The Rachel Corrie's mission came just five days after Israeli commandos raided a similar flotilla in an incident that left nine passengers aboard the Turkish-flagged vessel Mavi Marmara dead. CNN's Michal Zippori contributed to this report.","NEW: Fellow Nobel laureate Jody Williams defends Mairead Maguire .

"(CNN) -- Liverpool chairman Martin Broughton claims there have been ""several"" bids for the club after Chinese businessman Kenneth Huang's interest was confirmed to CNN. A spokesman for the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) told CNN that Huang made an enquiry about buying the English Premier League club, and that he was passed on to Broughton and investment bank Barclays Capital. Barclays Capital and Liverpool would only confirm to CNN that the process was ""ongoing."" The English club's current owners -- American duo George Gillett and Tom Hicks -- put the club up for sale in April and appointed British Airways chairman Broughton to oversee the deal. I'm staying at Liverpool, says Fernando Torres . The pair took control of the club three years ago but have endured widespread protests against their ownership due to the amount of debt they loaded onto the club. Accounts published in June 2009 revealed the club's debts were $462 million and that they had paid $54 million of interest payments to RBS, to service an estimated debt to the bank of around $377 million. The club did receive a boost on Tuesday though, with the news that star striker Fernando Torres was staying at the club. The Spanish forward had been linked with a host of top sides but he told the club's official website he was ""really happy"" at Anfield. News of Huang's interest was widely reported in the British press on Tuesday, with the UK Press Association quoting Broughton as saying there were ""several"" bids for the club. ""Any bids that go straight to RBS - and there have been several - come to me and are directed to Barcap (Barclays Capital),"" he said. ""RBS are not involved. The control remains with the board. ""It still remains the objective to conclude a deal before the end of the transfer window. That remains the objective but there are no deadlines, and we will continue working to complete the process. ""Both George Gillett and Tom Hicks remain on the board and they have given commitments that the board of Kop Holdings [Liverpool's UK parent company] is the party that is responsible for the sale."" According to reports in the Chinese press, Huang was born in Guangzhou and studied at his hometown university before switching to the United States and Columbia University. He became the first Chinese graduate to work at the New York Stock Exchange. He is chief executive of Chinese sports investment company QSL and is reported as having a stake in baseball team the New York Yankees as well as NBA side Cleveland Cavaliers. Liverpool's fans have long protested against Gillett and Hicks' regime and the club finished a disappointing seventh in the Premier League last season, missing out on qualification for the lucrative Champions League. Former manager Rafael Benitez left the club for Inter Milan and was replaced by Roy Hodgson, who left Fulham to take up the post at Anfield. He has since signed England international Joe Cole. News of a potential sale will provide encouragement to Hodgson, who may be afforded additional transfer funds if any deal goes through.","Chinese businessman Kenneth Huang makes enquiry about buying English club Liverpool .

"(CNN) -- Chelsea have maintained their 100 percent record in the English Premier League with a comfortable victory over Stoke City. After scoring 12 goals in their opening two English Premier League fixtures, Chelsea had to settle for just two at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. Goals in either half from Florent Malouda and Didier Drogba -- the Ivorian's fourth goal this season came from the penalty spot -- was enough to see off Stoke City and gives the English champions a two point lead at the top of the table after only three games. Having secured their passage to the Champions League group stages in midweek, Tottenham returned to Earth with a bump against Wigan losing 0-1 at White Hart Lane. It was a far cry from last season when Harry Redknapp's side thrashed Wigan 9-1 in the corresponding fixture. A late goal from Hugo Rodallega secured Wigan's first points of the season, and will surely lift some of the early season gloom engulfing Roberto Martinez's men who shipped 10 goals without reply in their opening two matches. Andrey Arshavin scored Arsenal's winner as they overcame Blackburn Rovers 1-2 at Ewood Park. Theo Walcott gave The Gunners the lead after 20 minutes shooting past former England goalkeeper, Paul Robinson. But Blackburn equalized seven minutes later when striker Mame Biram Diouf slotted home from close range. Despite having most of the possession, Arsenal found another goal hard to come by. But a typically robust Blackburn side were undone when Arshavin's low shot found a route to goal through a crowd of Blackburn shirts, to seal the three points. The victory lifts Arsenal to 2nd in the table. Manchester United cruised to a 3-0 victory over West Ham at Old Trafford. Wayne Rooney opened the scoring after 33 minutes -- and his account for the season -- when he converted from the penalty spot after Ryan Giggs had been fouled by West Ham's Jonathan Spector. Nani and Dimitar Berbatov added two more goals in the second half. The result lifts Alex Ferguson's team to third in the table, level on points with Arsenal. Meanwhile, West Ham remain at the bottom of the table without a win to their name and a goal difference of minus eight. Ian Holloway's Blackpool side were moments away from their first home win of the season against Fulham only to be denied by a late equalizer from Dickson Etuhu. Striker Bobby Zamora gave Mark Hughes' side the lead after 35 minutes, but Blackpool struck back with two goals in five minutes midway through the second half courtesy of an own goal from John Pantsil, followed by a low drive from Blackpool's on-loan striker Luke Varney. The result means Blackpool remain one point and one place ahead of Fulham in the table in 10th spot. Wolves and Newcastle drew 1-1 in a tight game at Molineux. Sylvain Ebanks-Blake gave the home side the lead shortly before half time. But in-form striker Andy Carroll equalized for Newcastle after 62 minutes when he headed home a Joey Barton free-kick. The draw keeps Wolves (five points) a point ahead of Newcastle in the table. Sunday's fixtures see Liverpool take on West Brom, Manchester City travel to Sunderland, Aston Villa host Everton, while Bolton and Birmingham face each other at the Reebok Stadium.","Chelsea maintain 100 percent record with 2-0 home win against Stoke City .

"(CNN) -- An autopsy has been completed on former Olympian and UNC track coach Antonio Pettigrew, but reports from the examination are pending and the cause of his death has not been released, the North Carolina Office of the Chief Medical Examiner said Wednesday. The body of Pettigrew, a former 400-meter world champion who returned his gold medal after he admitted doping, was found in the back seat of his car early Tuesday, according to the Chatham County, North Carolina, Sheriff's Office. Pettigrew, 42, was an assistant track coach at the University of North Carolina. His friends were looking for him after he failed to show up for work, authorities said. ""They attempted to retrace his route to work and shortly afterwards found him unresponsive in the back seat of his 2008 white Dodge Aspen on a bridge on U.S. 751."" Deputies responded to the call about 3:15 a.m. ""and found he was deceased with no apparent trauma,"" the statement said. ""There were indications that Pettigrew may have taken the sleep aid Unisom, but it is still unclear if this caused his death."" Pettigrew's body was taken to a hospital, and the medical examiner ordered an autopsy, police said. The autopsy was completed Tuesday, said Sharon Artis of the medical examiner's office. Pettigrew's wife had also reported him missing, and deputies in Wake County had responded to the couple's Apex, North Carolina, home, authorities said. He had last been heard from about 10:30 a.m. on Monday, the statement said. Pettigrew won gold at the 1991 world championships in Tokyo, Japan, and was a member of the American 4x400 squad that won a gold medal for a relay in the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. However, in 2008 Pettigrew admitted being part of a systematic doping program organized by former coach Trevor Graham between 1997 and 2003. Members of the relay squad were stripped of their medals. Pettigrew was in his fourth season at UNC, where he led the university's sprinters, hurdlers and relay teams, according to the UNC Athletics website. ""Although we are still learning the circumstances, we are deeply saddened to learn of Antonio's death,"" UNC athletic director Dick Baddour said Tuesday in a statement on the website. ""I was particularly impressed with his student-athletes and the pride he took in representing the University of North Carolina. Our deepest condolences go out to Antonio's family, particularly his wife and son.""","NEW: Autopsy is complete, but final reports are still pending .

"(CNN) -- Dear Mr. Lucas, . I was sincerely disturbed when I found out you where planning on converting the ""Star Wars"" franchise to 3-D. This is one of the worst ideas you've ever had about ""Star Wars."" And let's face it -- you've had some real stinkers: ""The Star Wars Holiday Special"" ring a bell? I want to believe that you think this is a good move for the franchise but please consider what 3-D will do to the ""Star Wars"" legacy. Sure, it seems like every other movie that gets released these days is 3-D -- some a lot better than others. As a wise man once said, ""This is a dangerous time for you when you will be tempted by the dark side of the Force."" I am a huge fan of the ""Star Wars"" movies. Thank you for all the years of enjoyment you have given me. When I sat in the theater in Petersburg, Virginia, in 1977 and saw ""Star Wars"" (I refuse to call it ""A New Hope"") I walked away with a vision of not only how good can triumph over evil but how seeing a movie could be the coolest thing to ever happen to me. I was there for ""Empire"" and ""Jedi"" and read everything I could about the movies. I had the toys and waited for the sequels you promised us. When I heard that you where going to make prequels I was a little kid again. I was in line to see the first one, opening night at 12:01 am and ... Why did you do that to me? To us? There was little to love in ""The Phantom Menace,"" and I was so ready to love it. I think this 3-D idea is doomed to be a repeat performance. If you're going to capitalize on me -- and people like me -- at least let us get something out of it that rivals our dedication to the Jedi universe. To be fair, I get that the legions of die-hard ""Star Wars"" fans are partially to blame for your latest twist of the knife. If we did not see episodes I - III in droves, you would have never thought of doing this. And I'll confess, as mad as I am at you, I will be there at 12:01 am again to see the 3-D version of that torturous experience that is Jar Jar Binks. I know I'd regret it if I didn't. So would most, if not all, of the ""Star Wars"" fans I know. iReport: The people behind ""The People vs. George Lucas"" We will say how we hate it. We will say we won't go. But as it gets closer we will cave. The worst part is you know we will and that we still care about your creations. Please, Mr. Lucas, stop changing the movies. Han shot first. You don't need to make them better. We already think they're perfect. If you need to expand, then give us the sequel. Give us something that is new and not just an indulgent reworking of one of the greatest movie franchises ever. I'm asking ""Star Wars"" fans to try to stop spending money on your rehashes. By now it's embarrassing how we act like starving dogs, happy with whatever ""Star Wars"" scrap we get. For the sake of our collective, cherished memories, this must stop. Thank you sir for your consideration, and: May the Force be with you!","Lucasfilm Ltd. announced they would return the ""Star Wars"" movies to theaters, this time in 3-D .

"(InStyle.com) -- It's been a big summer for wedded bliss: In the last few months, everyone from Penelope Cruz to Carrie Underwood to Emily Blunt has tied the knot. And, try as Chelsea Clinton might to keep the particulars under wraps, details of her upcoming nuptials have been slowly but surely leaking out. We're eagerly awaiting pictures of the former first daughter's gown -- rumor has it, she's wearing Vera Wang or Oscar de la Renta -- but in the meantime, we've decided to take a look back at the ten most iconic wedding dresses ever. Jacqueline Bouvier  The future first lady (and fashion icon) wore a voluminous ivory silk taffeta gown by the designer Ann Lowe when she married John F. Kennedy in 1953. A portrait neckline and wide, embellished skirt emphasized Jackie's small waist, and an heirloom lace veil, which originally belonged to her grandmother, completed the super-romantic ensemble. See all 21 best dressed celebrity brides . Gwen Stefani  Christian Dior designer John Galliano created this dip-dyed silk faille gown specifically for the singer's 2002 marriage to rocker Gavin Rossdale, and it's a triumph of personal style -- equal parts girlie and punk, just like the pop star herself. Grace Kelly  In 1956, she played a princess onscreen in ""The Swan"" and then assumed the role in real life: The pearl-studded, long-sleeved gown she wore to marry Monaco's Prince Rainier was a parting gift from Grace Kelly's former studio, MGM. Conceived by costume designer Helen Rose--and constructed by three dozen seamstresses over six weeks -- the elaborate silk faille, silk tulle, and rose point lace confection was pure Hollywood fantasy. InStyle.com: See celebrity-inspired engagement rings . Portia DeRossi Both of the brides wore Zac Posen at their 2008 ceremony: Ellen DeGeneres opted for a tailored ensemble consisting of white pants, a dress shirt, and a white vest, while DeRossi chose a dramatic (and beautiful) backless gown with a ballerina-inspired pale pink tulle skirt. Lady Diana Spencer  Yes, her puff-sleeved, ruffled, silk taffeta gown -- decorated with lace, embroidery, sequins, and around 10,000 tiny pearls -- wasn't exactly understated. But then neither was anything else about Diana's royal wedding to Prince Charles in 1981. InStyle.com: Stars' most memorable dresses . Marilyn Monroe  They seemed, to some, like a match made in heaven: the big-screen siren and the baseball star. While Monroe's marriage to Joe DiMaggio didn't even last a year, the fur-collared brown wool suit she wore to their 1954 ceremony at San Francisco's City Hall was utterly timeless. Elizabeth Taylor  Taylor's Cleopatra co-star Richard Burton was her fifth husband. (And her sixth -- they remarried less than two years after their first divorce.) So it makes sense that, in 1964, she decided against a traditional white dress. Instead, Taylor opted for a round-necked daffodil yellow chiffon mini topped with a headdress made of white hyacinths and lilies of the valley. (She wore green to their do-over in 1976.)

"(CNN) -- Former CNN anchor Lou Dobbs said Thursday said neither he nor his companies have ever hired illegal immigrants and it was not his responsibility to check their papers. Dobbs challenged an online article accusing him of hiring contractors who employ illegal immigrants on his properties. During his afternoon show on WOR NewsTalk Radio 710 in New York, he and Isabel Macdonald, author of The Nation piece, debated what he should have done to ensure the workers were in the United States legally. Dobbs, who left CNN in November 2009, repeatedly asked Macdonald whether he or his companies had ever hired an illegal immigrant. ""No,"" she said. But Macdonald said that the situation involved Dobbs and his Dobbs Group hiring contractors that she said used undocumented workers. She  pressed the journalist on whether he had ever checked on the status of workers at his properties. Dobbs, who called the article a ""hit piece,"" countered that he had no legal right to do so. ""They want me checking citizenship and status?,"" he said later in his show. ""I don't think so,"" adding he could be sued for stepping in. ""I have documented that undocumented workers have been fundamental in the maintenance of your estate in West Palm Beach,"" said Macdonald. The talk show host said workers at his New Jersey farm receive health and retirement benefits. ""You can understand my sensitivity in you going after my 22-year-old daughter. That doesn't sit well with me,"" Dobbs told the author. He defended the hiring of those working at the stables. ""I have been told they are absolutely legal."" Macdonald said Dobbs is responsible for those working at his properties. ""I didn't hire him directly,"" Dobbs replied to a claim that an undocumented Guatemalan was paid $8 an hour to watch his grounds. ""I didn't hire him undirectly."" In the article posted Wednesday on The Nation's website and headlined ""Lou Dobbs, American Hypocrite,"" the leftist political magazine reports that Dobbs hired contractors who used illegal immigrants for landscaping work and caring for horses ridden by his daughter, Hillary Dobbs, a champion show jumper. It says the landscaping and equestrian industries depend on illegal immigrants due to the low pay, long hours and physical labor. In the article, several people identified as current or former workers on Dobbs' properties say they were in the United States illegally at the time. However, the article says none of the names reported for the workers are real because they requested aliases to prevent their possible deportation or firing. Dobbs has a history of making critical comments about the high number of illegal immigrants and the way they are treated. In particular, he has said that employers who hire illegal immigrants should be prosecuted. ""Why not make it a felony for illegal employers who hire illegal aliens?"" Dobbs asked on his CNN show on April 4, 2006. The next day, he said on his show that field workers are paid ""not, in my opinion, an adequate wage, but a decent wage,"" adding: ""These people deserve to be paid more. And we're sitting here talking about more of the same, allowing people to be exploited in this country."" The Nation article reports that one worker said he crossed the Yuma Desert on foot from Mexico five years ago, eluding the border patrol, in order to find work. According to the article, the man said an old friend worked at a stable owned by Dobbs and promised the man work as a groom at a Vermont stable contracted to care for horses owned by the Dobbs Group, which is headed by Dobbs. The man held the job for more than two years without legal documentation, the article says, adding that he then obtained a guest-worker visa, designed for seasonal foreign workers. The article says Dobbs on his CNN show had denounced such visas as a form of ""indentured servitude."" Another man whom the article says cared for Dobbs Group horses is quoted as saying the job required him to be available at all hours, day and night. ""I looked after Dobbs' horses while I was illegal,"" the article quotes him as saying. Several workers are quoted in the article as saying they believe that Hillary Dobbs knew about their lack of legal papers. The article says she ""did not respond to repeated attempts to contact her for comment."" The Nation identified Macdonald as a freelance journalist and former communications director of the media watch group Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting. It was reported with research support by the Investigative Fund at The Nation Institute, according to the website post. ""You put out an article that is being used by the left-wing press as a hammer on me,"" Dobbs told Macdonald. ""And you know full well, you already acknowledge, I never hired illegal immigrants, my company never has and I don't condone it."" Dobbs and Macdonald had a testy exchange at the end of the WOR segment. ""Your listeners deserve to know the truth,"" said Macdonald. ""Come back and next time concentrate on truth, reality and straight-forwardness,"" Dobbs replied. The pair continued the debate Thursday night on MSNBC's ""The Last Word."" ""Even Lou Dobbs, the emblem of this get-tough approach on immigration enforcement, even he has been unable to manage his property [so that] there will be no undocumented workers,"" Macdonald said. Dobbs said he has done nothing wrong and is being targeted. He also said the article omitted the fact that he is seeking a compromise on immigration issues. Dobbs did not return calls from CNN seeking comment Thursday.","Former CNN anchor says he's not allowed to ask status of people working for contractors .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- The prosecution in the trial of Anna Nicole Smith's manager-boyfriend Howard K. Stern and two doctors portrayed the actress as an addict who had no control over her drugs in closing arguments that began Monday. Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney David Barkhurst used two Norman Rockwell portraits to show jurors ""What doctors should do,"" while painting Drs. Khristine Eroshevich and Sandeep Kapoor as physicians who fed Smith's addiction instead of treating her illnesses. Doctors have a responsibility to protect patients ""even from themselves,"" Barkhurst said. Stern and the doctors are accused of conspiring to feed the reality TV star and Playboy model's drug addiction and using false names to obtain the drugs. The defendants are not charged in Smith's February 2007 death, which a Florida medical examiner ruled was from an accidental overdose of a sleep aid, a lethal mix of prescription drugs and a viral flu. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Robert Perry has been highly critical of the prosecution's case, suggesting it was built from ""a dead celebrity and a bunch of low-level misdemeanors."" Perry said he decided to allow the case to go forward after another respected judge advised him to trust the jury system. The judge has questioned whether the prosecution has proved that Smith was an addict, as defined by California law, and not just dependent on drugs to relieve chronic pain. ""If she's being treated for pain, it's not illegal,"" Perry said last week. Barkhurst, the first of two prosecutors to deliver closing arguments, said that at some point during the last three years of Smith's life, Eroshevich and Kapoor were no longer treating Smith's pain, ""but were prescribing to treat her addiction."" ""There is not a single physical test done on Anna Nicole Smith during the time Dr. Kapoor is treating her,"" Barkhurst said. Eroshevich kept no medical records of her care for Smith, but simply used her ""prescription pad power"" to provide controlled drugs to her. Both doctors crossed ethical lines by developing personal friendships with Smith, Barkhurst told jurors. ""A doctor can't be both a physician and a friend,"" Barkhurst said. He reminded jurors of photos shown earlier of Eroshevich naked with Smith in a hot tub at her Bahamas home months before her death. ""She is writing prescriptions to keep Anna Nicole euphoric, not to treat a medical condition,"" the prosecutor said. He read entries from Kapoor's personal diary written after he and Smith attended a gay pride event. ""I was making out with Anna, my patient, blurring the lines,"" Kapoor's diary said. Another diary entry was evidence Kapoor knew his prescriptions for Smith were illegal, Barkhurst said. ""I give her methadone, valium. Can she ruin me?"" Evidence that Smith was an addict dates back to 1996, when she voluntarily entered the Betty Ford Clinic, he argued. Kapoor should have recognized that Smith was an addict when she first came to his office in April 2004 and asked for one of the most powerful painkillers available, Barkhurst said. ""Anna Nicole Smith liked Dilaudid,"" he said.  ""She asked for what she liked."" Kapoor gave her another prescription for Dilaudid six weeks later when Smith complained of pain from two ribs broken in a May 27, 2004, Jet Ski accident. ""If she was on Dilaudid at the time she cracked her ribs, certainly she shouldn't be on a Jet Ski,"" Barkhurst said. Kapoor ordered no X-rays or tests and did not take time to call another doctor who treated her the day of the accident, he said. Smith got Dilaudid from four different doctors that month, he said. A doctor who treated Smith at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in June 2006 testified that she concluded Smith was addicted to drugs, Barkhurst told jurors. When Dr. Natalie Maullin asked Kapoor then if Smith had any addiction issues, Kapoor laughed and said there have been some issues, Barkhurst said. Closing arguments are expected to last through Wednesday. Two charges against Stern were thrown out by Perry, who questioned the evidence that Stern, a lawyer, knew it was illegal to get drugs in multiple names. ""It has all the hallmarks of a kitchen sink prosecution,"" Perry said last week. ""It looks like the prosecution is throwing everything in with the hope that something will survive."" Perry hinted that if the defendants are found guilty, he would consider ""possible selective prosecution issues"" when sentencing them. During the two-month-long trial, prosecutors showed a 13-minute video of Smith bathing with her infant daughter months before her death to support their argument that Smith's speech was slurred and her mind was groggy from drugs. Jurors were not allowed to see the bizarre video, which shows Smith talking in a childlike manner during a birthday party for a 9-year-old girl. The defense does not deny Smith took a lot of drugs, but it says the doctors were treating her for chronic pain that other doctors had also diagnosed. The prosecution's case was hampered by several key witnesses recanting details of earlier statements, including a former nanny who said she never saw Stern injecting Smith with a needle.

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- The Basque separatist group ETA released a cease-fire statement Sunday to various media, including the Basque newspaper Gara, where it typically releases information. ETA has announced cease-fires before and broken them, notably the unilateral 2006 cease-fire that was announced as ""permanent,"" only to be broken months later with a car bomb at Madrid's airport that killed two people. In a statement published on the Gara website on Sunday, ETA --- which is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its long fight for Basque independence in northern Spain and southwest France -- calls on the Spanish government to ""agree to the minimum democratic solutions necessary to start a democratic process."" Officials at Spain's Interior Ministry said the cease-fire announcement was being studied cautiously but that no senior officials were due to speak publicly about it, CNN affiliate CNN+ reported. The prime minister's office told CNN it had no comment. The latest cease-fire announcement was not unexpected, following weeks of calls for a new peace process by some smaller leftist Basque political parties. The cease-fire announcement also follows months of what is widely regarded as a successful police crackdown against ETA operatives in Spain and also in ETA's hideouts in neighboring France and Portugal. Police have arrested many of ETA's suspected top operatives, as well as many ETA foot soliders, and seized bomb-making materials and weapons from hidden arms caches, virtually shutting off ETA attacks. In its cease-fire announcement Sunday, ETA said that ""months ago it decided not to carry out armed offensive actions,"" but made no mention of what it might consider a ""defensive"" action. The announcement was accompanied an ETA video which showed three apparent ETA members seated at a table in front of an ETA banner and facing a camera. They wore white face hoods with eye holes but their mouths covered, black berets and black jerseys. The person in the middle apeared to do all the speaking in the ancient Basque language -- not in Spanish -- and the voice seemed to be that of a woman. ETA is listed as a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union for its campaign of car bombings and shootings. The Spanish government of Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero began a peace process in 2006 during the last unilateral ETA cease-fire, but after ETA's airport bomb, the government called off negotiations. Since then, officials of Zapatero's government have said they would accept only a definitive statement from ETA to end its armed fight, and to announce when and where it would lay down its arms forever, and not simply a cease-fire. Only then would the government be willing to consider leniency for some of the more than 500 ETA prisoners in jail. The Basque region in northern Spain already has considerable home-rule authority, with its own police, parliament, taxing power and control of health and education. But ETA rejects those as partial steps, and has fought for full independence. ETA's goal is an independent Basque nation comprising the three-province Basque region and the neighboring Navarra region in Spain, along with three departments in southwest France that also have Basque roots. About three million people live in those areas now. ETA's cease-fire statement called on the international community to get involved in the Basque peace process. On Sunday, the leader of the Sinn Fein party in Northern Ireland said he supported the cease-fire. ""Gerry Adams has welcomed ETA cease-fire announcement,"" the Sinn Fein party said on its Twitter page.","The ETA announced a cease-fire on Sunday to various media .

"(OPRAH.com) -- Slouching over coffee in a booth at a New York diner, Jerry Seinfeld looks so...Seinfeldian, you might think he was shooting a scene from the old sitcom. But this is a different Jerry: a husband and father of three, who, at 55, finds himself comfortably bemused by the strange intricacies of marriage. It's his current obsession and the subject of the new show he's coproducing, ""The Marriage Ref"" -- a stand-up/reality-TV hybrid that features clips of real couples in real tussles, plus a panel of celebrity ""experts"" and a referee (comedian Tom Papa) who ultimately declares the husband or wife in each standoff the winner. If you've seen the show, you already know that the niggling mundanity of other people's lives provides its share of laughs, yet Seinfeld is expecting even more. ""I hope it's not grandiose to say, but maybe it'll save a marriage here and there,"" he explains. ""I gotta believe that somewhere, someone out there is going to go, 'I'm not the only one!'"" Lucy Kaylin: This is a pretty big topic you're taking on. Jerry Seinfeld: I feel like Jacques Cousteau, frankly. I feel like the first person to explore the ocean. And we're just gonna go out and search and -- . LK: Spelunk. JS: Spelunking is for caves. I'm talking about oceanography. Caves are small; the ocean is vast. In the comedy business, you deal with scarcity all the time. You never have enough funny things. But in this show, it's the exact opposite. You talk about, What's a great sitcom? What's a great romantic comedy premise? Well, here it is: Here's a man and here's a woman, and they have decided to shackle themselves together. Let's see how that works out. Oprah.com: The definitions Jerry thinks every couple needs . LK: Tell me about the spat between you and your wife, Jessica, that prompted the idea for The Marriage Ref. JS: A friend of hers was over. I don't even know what it was about, but we got into something. And the friend started to get uncomfortable and said, ""Maybe I should go."" And I hit upon the idea of, ""No, you have to stay. You have to solve this for me."" And we each pleaded our case. LK: Who won? JS: Well, it wasn't me. But the simplicity of it was exciting. LK: Do you think there should be ground rules for marital fights? Oprah.com: The fight that can save your marriage . JS: The best piece of advice I received before I got married was, ""Be careful what you say when you're in a fight, because it could stick in someone's head."" I don't think I've ever said anything I really regretted. I'm very sympathetic to women. I've really studied wife-ology, and I know you've got to figure out the feelings. Deal with the feelings. LK: So what's your fighting style? JS: I can get very lawyerly when my wife and I get into a thing. I get very logical and I try and channel my emotion through that. LK: Well, that's one approach. JS: If you're a man, you have to figure out what she needs to hear. So ask her: ""What do you need to hear me say?"" And then just say it. That's a very good way out of an argument. But then you have to act -- you have to say it like you mean it. Even our kids have this thing where, if you say, ""I'm sorry,"" they go, ""No, say a nice sorry. If it's not a nice sorry, it doesn't count."" LK: Any other ground rules? JS: I'm very big on staying in the room. In fact, I said this to my wife the other day: ""I understand that you're so upset that you just want to walk away. But, you know, I don't care that it's hard."" You stay in the room until you feel better. Then you can leave. LK: How about the classic, ""Don't go to bed angry""? JS: I remember agreeing to that on the night of our wedding. I don't think we've kept it once. Oprah.com: What's wrong with being angry? LK: So monogamy -- is it natural? Something we ought to aspire to? JS: My personal viewpoint is this: The problem with humans is our heads are just way too big. And one of the greatest appeals of monogamy is the simplification of the mental process. I don't have any friends who aren't faithful to their wives, but if I did, my main question would be, ""Who's got time to figure all that out?"" It's just too much work. The emotions that have to be disposed of, the values, the ethics.... All I see is this gigantic amount of work for a fleeting pleasure. People should get married because they have finally seen the folly of being single: ""Oh, this is all just kind of a bad magic trick. I just keep bending over to reach for this wallet on a string. How much longer am I gonna do that?"" LK: What's one of the things you most like about being married? JS: I love being made fun of, if it's done well. I love being brought down to size. LK: And your wife is good at that? JS: Yes. Yes. Yes, she is. I feel like humor is the answer to everything. For example, let's look at David Letterman and Tiger Woods. Now, there are some differences to the two situations. The biggest difference is, what can a guy who has humor do that a guy who does not have humor cannot do? You're looking at a guy who knows how to make fun of himself, and a guy who hasn't the first clue how to make fun of himself -- and the resulting difficulty. If you have a little bit of humor in the shaker and you can sprinkle that on, that's your answer. LK: So ultimately, is marriage worth it? Or is it the most foolhardy thing we could do? JS: No more foolhardy than ""I think I'll take human form for 75 years and try to negotiate the planet I see below me."" There's a tremendous power and energy in sharing your life with another person. I'm married ten years next week, and it's as big a joy for me now as it was when we first started dating.

"(CNN) -- Disgraced American sprinter Justin Gatlin made a successful return to competition on Tuesday following his four-year ban for drug use. The 28-year-old, who won Olympic gold in the 100 meters in 2004 and two world titles the following year, made his comeback at an athletics meet in Eastern Europe. He was the fastest in the 100m heats with a time of 10.34 seconds, qualifying ahead of his compatriots J-Mee Samuels and Rubin Williams at the Kuldliiga meeting in Estonia. Gatlin, who tested positive for excessive levels of testosterone in April 2006, then triumphed in 10.24 in the final from Samuels (10.31) and Williams (10.54). He had told reporters ahead of the event that he hoped to break the 10-second mark, but was nowhere near threatening his personal best of 9.85. He will again run on Sunday at an event in the Estonian capital of Tallinn. Gatlin had equaled Asafa Powell's former world record of 9.77 in May 2006, but this was later expunged from the books. During his time away from the track, Gatlin spent time working with American NFL teams Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Tennessee Titans and Houston Texans but did not manage to earn a playing contract.","Former Olympic and world champion sprinter Justin Gatlin wins on comeback in Estonia .

"(CNN) -- The Tea Party has rekindled excitement in the potential of the internet to nurture mass political movements by using the Web to raise money and mobilize manpower. Activists have used many aspects of cyberspace: Facebook pages, Twitter feeds, iPod apps and more to rally their supporters. According to Investors.com, ""Democrats and their allies dominated cyberspace for years. Now the political right, with the Tea Party explosion, at the very least is matching the left."" The stories about the Tea Party movement resemble the narrative about Barack Obama's campaign. In 2008, Democrats used cyberspace to the same effect. Relying on what I called ""Facebook politics,"" the Democrats took Republicans by surprise by demonstrating how powerful a vehicle the internet could be in promoting a candidacy, bringing like-minded citizens together and offering an organizational infrastructure for movement politics. Yet will this form of organizing work over the long term? Can it sustain a movement after the drama of an election is over? The verdict is still out. Since 2008, President Obama and Democrats have discovered that the kind of movement created by the internet can be extraordinarily fragile and fleeting. When Obama recently spoke to students at the University of Wisconsin, he implored them not to be apathetic and urged them to return to the world of campaigns. In doing so, he was acknowledging that the movement created by the campaign had disintegrated since the inauguration. The movement has been largely absent from the policy battles that have shaped his administration, and it lags in the months leading into 2010. Obama's team may still have all the cell numbers that they collected before announcing their vice presidential pick, but few people are answering or texting. What makes Facebook politics vulnerable is that it lacks the local element that has always been so crucial to politics. The most durable forms of political organization have usually depended on local organizing. During the 19th century, political parties were dependent on a dense bottom-up structure rooted in the strength of local political machines. After Election Day, party operatives continued to remain in close contact with voters. They worked hard -- sometimes through illegal means but very often through policy and straightforward patronage -- to retain their loyalty and make sure voters were kept abreast of why their party mattered. The social movements of 20th-century America depended on local organization as well. Malcolm Gladwell recently recounted in The New Yorker that the civil rights movement of the 1960s depended on local activists such as the four African-American students who sat in an all-white Woolworth's lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina, and demanded service. Their personal ties and friendship, as well as their shared experiences, inspired them to work together and risk their lives for this bigger cause. The movement spread as students throughout the state and in other regions joined the cause. Over the next few years, activists from the North would travel into Southern states and join the civil rights cause. It was the experience of directly participating in the struggles and witnessing the kind of racism that existed that forged their connection to the movement. Conservatism in the 1970s was forged through similar dynamics. Ronald Reagan did not make modern conservatism. Rather, thousands of local activists around the country who interacted through church groups, civic organizations and even reading clubs gave rise to the modern right. It was their face-to-face encounters in places such as Orange County, California, and the shared memory of influencing political leaders and public policy that made these Americans so loyal and willing to continue participating in these struggles over time. Facebook politics seems different. The cost of participating is much less. National conversations are as powerful, if not more powerful, than local networks. The experience of being in such a movement is often virtual, requiring nothing but a few clicks on a keyboard. Some of the potential weaknesses of Facebook politics can be seen with the new darling of the Tea Party movement, Delaware Senate candidate Christine O'Donnell. Although O'Donnell has been omnipresent in the national media, she has been notably absent where it matters most, Delaware. Matt Bai recently wrote in The New York Times that O'Donnell reflects the modern political strategy in that her campaign barely exists at the state level. Conservatives from all over the country helped boost her image and reputation online and through television and radio, but she has barely had any public events in the state. Republican leaders in Wilmington didn't know where she was campaigning. Despite her surprise win, she is way behind the Democrat in the polls. Without question, Facebook politics has reshaped the political landscape. Local candidates can rake in millions of dollars within days, and they can spread their name without anyone going door-to-door or holding fundraisers in the local Holiday Inn. But Obama has already learned that this kind of organization can leave successful candidates without their base of support once the excitement of Election Day is over. It is far too easy for the most fervent supporter of a candidate or cause to simply defriend the movement and move on to something else. Rather than strong, shared memories of participating in something bigger than themselves, the experience might just leave behind the address of a Web page in the auto-fill mechanism of their browser or an occasional text alert to remind them of their political past. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: Tea Party adept at ""Facebook politics,"" rallying supporters via cyberspace .

He says Twitter, Facebook can't sustain a movement when election drama is over .

"(CNN) -- Residents of Southern Sudan will begin registering November 14 for an historic referendum that will decide whether the region remains part of Sudan or breaks off to form a new nation. The registration -- which will run for 30 days -- was postponed once before, because registration materials were not ready. Voting is scheduled for January 9, leaving little room for other delays. ""We are worried; the time remaining is short and many things are not in place yet,"" said Hamilton Lugor, the deputy liaison officer for the government of Southern Sudan in Kenya. ""But what we will not allow is the referendum to be delayed even for one minute,"" he added. Diplomacy urgent as vote to split Sudan nears . People from Southern Sudan who live outside of the country will also have an opportunity to vote in the referendum in selected countries in Africa and the West. Another referendum will take place on the same day as that voting: that of Abyei, a disputed oil-rich border region between the North and the South which also wants to govern itself. Talks are being held in Ethiopia with the goal of breaking a stalemate between the two sides in regard to guidelines that will govern Abyei's referendum. The North insists that the Missiriya, a nomadic Arabic tribe, are eligible to vote in the Abyei referendum, but the South says only the permanently based Dinka tribe should have a right to vote. Recent media reports say that the Missiriya tribe has warned of war if its members are barred from voting. In a recent United Nations Special Summit on Sudan, the international community -- including U.S. President Barack Obama and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki moon -- reiterated its commitment to peace in Sudan and support for the upcoming referendums. More than 2 million people were killed in fighting between the North and South from 1983 to 2005, when a peace deal was finally brokered. That deal called for the referendum on independence for Southern Sudan.","Voter registration on the independence referendum begins in November .

"(CNN) -- Felipe Massa has been handed a two-year contract to keep him with Ferrari until the end of the 2012 Formula One season. The Brazilian joined the Italian team in 2006 and his contract extension ends speculation that he would be leaving at the end of the current campaign. Massa has recorded 11 victories and 360 championship points for Ferrari and currently sits seventh in the drivers' standings, 26 points behind leader Mark Webber, of Red Bull. Massa told Ferrari's official Web site: ""I am happy to be given the opportunity to drive for Ferrari for a further two seasons. ""Throughout my entire Formula One career, I have always raced with an engine made in Maranello and it is a matter of pride for me to be able to continue working with a team that I regard as a second family."" Massa suffered a fractured skull during the Hungarian Grand Prix in July last year and missed the rest of the season. He was fit to start the 2010 season but teammate Fernando Alonso has outshone him during the opening stages. However, Ferrari team principal Stefano Domenicali is delighted to retain the 29-year-old's services. He said: ""Felipe has been part of Ferrari for almost a decade and together with us, he has grown as a driver and as a man, going through some very difficult times as well as giving us moments of great happiness. ""We wanted to show proof of stability for the future, believing in the worth of a driver pairing that is without equal in terms of talent, speed and its ability to work together for the good of the team.""

"(CNN) -- A mother in Louisville, Kentucky, has died after saving her three children and two nieces by pushing them out the second-story window of her burning townhome. Bystanders who noticed the flames helped catch the children as Tomarra Finley guided them out on Thursday morning. After the five children were rescued, Finley, 31, was found unconscious by firefighters. They gave her oxygen and CPR, but she died later of smoke inhalation. Fire Capt.

"Washington (CNN) -- The challenger in a hotly contested race for a U.S. House seat in central Florida accused Democratic Rep. Alan Grayson on Monday of using misleading edits in a campaign ad to distort his comments. Former Florida state Rep. Dan Webster said the new ad by Grayson's re-election campaign doesn't accurately portray what the GOP candidate said. ""Religious fanatics try to take away our freedom -- in Afghanistan, in Iran and right here in Central Florida,"" says the narrator in the 30-second Grayson spot, which is cast on a background of Afghan women in burqas, militants with machine guns, and maps of Iran and Afghanistan. The ad which began airing over the weekend shows Webster telling a Christian group: ""Wives, submit yourself to your own husband"" and ""she should submit to me."" But video of Webster's full comment, provided to CNN by his campaign from a 2009 address in Nashville, Tennessee, seems to show a different picture of the candidate's intent. ""So, write a journal. Second, find a verse. I have a verse for my wife. I have verses for my wife,"" Webster goes onto say. ""Don't pick the ones that say, 'she should submit to me.' It's in the Bible, but pick the ones that you're supposed to do. ""So instead, 'Love your wife, even as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it,' as opposed to, 'Wives submit yourselves to your husband.' She can pray that if she wants to, but don't you pray it."" The Grayson campaign dismissed questions Monday over whether their editing had distorted the meaning of Webster's comments. ""Webster is a member of this group, Institute for Basic Life Principles. That's where he was speaking,"" said Grayson campaign spokesman Sam Drzymala. ""They are a group that interpret the Bible literally. When Webster says 'she should submit to me' is in the Bible, he believes that's the truth,"" Drzymala said. ""He is explaining that women and children should be submissive to their husbands and fathers, but that the men have to earn it, not just expect it."" The Grayson attack ad is the second in a matter of days to draw fire over factual claims. Last week, the two-term Florida Democrat's campaign released a spot dubbing Webster a ""draft dodger,"" during the Vietnam War. The ad cites a series of student deferments the GOP candidate received before reporting for duty. He was ultimately disqualified for medical reasons. Watch Anderson Cooper 360° weeknights 10pm ET.

"(CNN) -- Dani Pedrosa led from start-to-finish at Mugello to record a dominant victory in the Gran Premio d'Italia, as nine-time world champion Valentino Rossi began his recovery from a horror crash in practice. The Spaniard looked in total control throughout the race, taking the checkered flag ahead of world championship leader Jorge Lorenzo. Third-placed Andrea Dovizioso gave the home crowd something to cheer after Rossi fractured his tibia after coming off his bike during practice on Saturday. The reigning champion was taken straight to hospital for an operation and on Sunday he said it was a complete success. ""I want to thank everyone at Mugello and also all the riders who have wished me well: it's always a great feeling,"" Rossi was quoted as saying on the official Moto GP Web site. ""The operation went well, Doctor Buzzi has been exceptional and they are treating me like I'm part of the family here. I have had a pin inserted into my leg and tomorrow they will close and stitch the wound, then we will wait and begin a good rehabilitation program."" Of the crash Rossi said: ""They were difficult moments because it was a bad crash and a bad injury. I've watched the accident again and to see how my ankle looked was not a good feeling. There were a few moments of fear, but now I'm doing well. Rossi said his main focus was on returning as quickly as possible: ""It will take some time, but the important thing is that I'll return at 100%."" Australian Casey Stoner overtook both Marco Melandri, of Italy and France's Randy De Puniet on the final lap to finish fourth. But Pedrosa was rarely in any danger and he cut the gap between himself and Lorenzo to 25 points in the world championship standings.","Dani Pedrosa wins Moto GP's Gran Premio d'Italia .

"(CNN) -- German champions Bayern Munich will seek compensation from the Dutch Football Association after learning that star forward Arjen Robben will miss the start of the new season. Bayern revealed on Tuesday that the Netherlands winger will be sidelined for two months with a thigh injury he suffered in an international friendly before the start of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Robben missed the first two matches of the tournament, but the 26-year-old went on to play a key role as the Dutch reached the final before losing to Spain. He had a routine scan on his return to Munich following a post-World Cup break, revealing a torn muscle in his left thigh. ""This diagnosis after my return to the club comes as a huge shock. I'm extremely disappointed, as the enforced break is a big setback for me and for the team,"" he told the club's website. Bayern Munich chief medical officer Dr Hans-Wilhelm Mueller-Wohlfahrt said he had brought up his suspicions after Robben suffered the injury against Hungary. ""This is a serious injury. I consider it irresponsible that this injury was not more precisely diagnosed, and that Arjen was allowed to play,"" Mueller-Wohlfahrt said. ""I personally offered my assistance in diagnosing the original injury on several occasions, but this offer was never taken up."" Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said the club would be taking up the matter with the Dutch FA. ""Naturally, FC Bayern Munich is extremely angry. Yet again, we as a club are having to pay the price for a player sustaining a serious injury with his national team,"" the former Germany striker said. ""We will seek to reach an amicable settlement to this problem with the Dutch Football Association. Football's world governing body FIFA has been informed about Arjen Robben's injury, and we have requested FIFA to act as a mediator if necessary."" Bayern welcomed World Cup stars such as Philipp Lahm, Thomas Mueller, Miroslav Klose and Bastian Schweinsteiger back for pre-season training on Monday, along with young Germany midfielder Toni Kroos -- who is back at the club after spending last season on loan at Bayer Leverkusen. The Champions League runners-up kick off the new German league season at home to the 2009 Bundesliga winners Wolfsburg on August 20. Meanwhile, Schalke have followed up the signing of Real Madrid striker Raul by bringing in left-back Sergio Escudero, 20, from Spanish club Real Murcia on a four-year contract for an undisclosed fee. Belgian club Anderlecht earned a place in Friday's Champions League second-round qualifying draw after beating Welsh side the New Saints 6-1 on aggregate. Striker Romelu Lukaku scored a second-half double as the Belgian champions won 3-0 at home on Tuesday night. Israeli side Hapoel Tel-Aviv also progressed with a 3-2 aggregate victory over Kazakhstan's Aktobe. Hapoel lost the away leg 1-0 but led 3-0 at halftime through Eran Zahavi, loan stiker Ben Sahar and an own goal from Khalifa Elhadj Ba before Aktobe's Murat Tleshev scored a consolation in time added on. Austria's Rapid Vienna moved into the playoffs of the second-tier Europa League with a 4-0 aggregate win against PFC Beroe Stara Zagora. Croatia international Nikica Jelavic scored twice in Tuesday night's 3-0 victory over the Bulgarian Cup holders, with Markus Katzer sealing the result.","Arjen Robben will miss the start of the German Bundesliga season on August 20 .

"(CNN) -- After just one season in charge at Bayern Munich, coach Louis Van Gaal has led the German side to the verge of European supremacy with a place in the Champions League final. The 58-year-old Dutchman will be hoping for his second victory in the tournament which he first won with Amsterdam-based team Ajax back in 1995, when he goes head-to-head with Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan in Madrid on 22 May. Van Gaal will also be attempting to achieve the historic triple having already taken his team to the Bundesliga title and to victory in the German Cup. Things didn't begin so well for Van Gaal's opening season at the Munich club though, and after almost crashing out of the Champions League competition following two successive defeats to Bordeaux, many fans would not have expected their team to reach the final stage. Can Mourinho beat Van Gaal to become king of Europe? But many are now praising Van Gaal for turning the clubs fortunes around, and neutrals are widely backing him to finish the job at the Bernabeu on Saturday. Record . Van Gaal has won an impressive 18 titles from the four clubs he has managed over the course of his career and some of his greatest achievements arguably come from his time in charge of Ajax in the mid 90's. Winning three Dutch league and cup titles as well as the UEFA Cup in 1992 and Champions League in 1995, Ajax were a dominant force under Van Gaal's reign, providing the majority of players for Holland's national team. Moving onto Barcelona in 1997, Van Gaal led the Spanish side to two La Liga titles. He finally left his position at Barca in 2003 after seeing through a brief spell as boss of the national side between 2000-02. Returning to his home country, Van Gaal went on to manage AZ Alkmaar, a team his steered to the league title in 2009 -- a feat he described as is his ""most beautiful achievement"" -- before leaving for Bayern Munich. Personality . Declaring himself as self-confident, arrogant, dominant, honest, industrious and innovative, at the press conference where he was unveiled as the club's new coach, Bayern boss Van Gaal showed he was no slouch at self-assessment. Such is the dedication he brings to his job, Van Gaal famously shut himself away in a German monastery in 2009 to fast track his learning of the new language. However, Van Gaal will undoubtedly always be remembered for his fiery temper which has seen him clash with some of his players in recent times. He famously let rip at Frenchman Franck Ribery who dared to sit down and take his boots of during a training session on a hot day last year and at Italian Luca Toni, who left Bayern for AC Roma shortly after being reprimanded by Van Gaal for falling asleep at a team lunch. But his meticulous and sometimes harsh style of management has also nurtured some major talents of the game. Van Gaal oversaw the fledgling careers of players such as Patrick Kluivert and Edwin Van der Sar at Ajax. Previous clashes . Van Gaal has described his meeting with Portuguese Mourinho in the Champions League final as ""God vs The Son of God."" Mourinho was an assistant to Van Gaal during his time at Barcelona in the late 1990's, and has often described the Dutchman as his mentor. And Van Gaal is full of praise for his former pupil. ""I think I educated him a little. I could immediately see he had an understanding of the game. Jose was very modest back then. It was nice watching his development, to see that he has become such a personality."" It is thought that the pair communicate regularly via text message, but despite being friends they are rivals on the pitch. Tactics . Given their history it is unsurprising the two men have a similar approach to the way they manage their football teams. However, Van Gaal has been keen to point out the differences: ""He trains to win. I train to play beautiful football and win. My way is more difficult."" Van Gaal will have a full squad of players to pick from on Saturday, with the exception of Ribery who is suspended following a booking in the previous round. It is expected that Turkey's Hamit Altinop will replace him in midfield. Fellow Dutchman Arjen Robben is also expected to play a big role in the match, as the forward is as keen as Van Gaal to beat Jose Mourinho, who he used to play under at Chelsea.","Bayern Munich coach Louis Van Gaal is on the verge of leading the German giants to a unique treble .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- A dozen Australian swimmers have fallen ill at the beleaguered Commonwealth Games in India, officials say. The swimmers are reporting a higher percentage of diarrhea than other athletes at the games, said an Australian official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Two Australian swimmers have withdrawn. ""The Commonwealth Games Federation chief, Mike Fennell, asked at a press conference Thursday that immediate tests be conducted on all pools. The organizing committee conducted the tests and have come back and said the water quality in all pools is clear,"" said an official with the Commonwealth Games Federation, who also spoke on condition of anonymity. When asked whether there was a problem with the food, he said: ""We are confident the food in the games village is up to international standards. Since September 12, more than 700 tests have been conducted on the food and all independent tests have passed with flying colors."" The federation is exploring what else could have sickened the athletes. The illnesses threaten to further mar the games, which have been widely criticized. Organizers scrambled to pull together the event after a pedestrian bridge at a stadium collapsed last month and officials called accommodations at the athletes' village uninhabitable and filthy. It's the first time India has hosted the international sporting event between countries of the former British Empire. The games, held every four years, include many Olympic events and other sports traditionally played in those countries. The games gave India an opportunity to promote a shiny image as an emerging power. The government spent billions on a new international airport, additional metro lines and fresh landscaping along dingy Delhi roads. Problems piled up before the games, however. Last month, gunmen fired on a tourist bus in New Delhi and injured two Taiwanese tourists. A car blaze turned out to be a crudely manufactured bomb. And a militant group warned that it planned to target the games. Indian law enforcement authorities responded with a heightened security plan, placing thousands of extra forces on the streets of the capital. Two world-class athletes canceled their trips, citing security and health concerns. Entire teams threatened to do the same, while others delayed their arrival date. Elena Baltacha, a tennis player picked to represent Scotland at the games, pulled out. ""I am incredibly disappointed, because I was really excited about playing for Scotland, but conditions in Delhi are such that going there would pose too high a risk to my health,"" she said at the time. India remains a developing country with millions of poor people, and risks such as dengue fever. On Monday, doctors confirmed a case of dengue fever in an official with the Indian lawn bowls team at the Commonwealth Games. The 30-year-old man could have contracted the disease from outside the athletes' village in New Delhi. He had complained of feeling sick a day after arriving at the athletes village last month, said a spokesman for the G.B. Pant Hospital in the city. Dengue is the most common virus transmitted by mosquitoes in the world. It causes as many as 100 million infections and kills 25,000 people every year. Dengue is found in tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas, according to the World Health Organization.","A dozen Australian swimmers have been sickened .

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- Mexican authorities have bolstered their search for a missing U.S. citizen and the government rejects assertions that security forces aren't doing enough to find him, the foreign ministry said Friday. David Michael Hartley has been missing since a reported pirate attack September 30 on a lake bisected by the U.S.-Mexico border. Hartley's wife, Tiffany, told authorities her husband was shot and killed by pirates on Falcon Lake during a sightseeing trip. His body has yet to be found, leading to questions about the accuracy of her statements. The ministry said the federal attorney general's office opened an investigation based on testimony Tiffany Hartley gave to Mexican authorities at the consulate in McAllen, Texas. The government also has been in close touch with several U.S. authorities. ""The search and rescue for Mr. Hartley started the day of the incident, and intensified this week with additional officers from the Army, the Federal Police, and from state and municipal forces, which cover the area where the incident reportedly took place,"" the ministry said. On Thursday, Tiffany Hartley said she might take a lie detector test if people continue to doubt the veracity of her account. If ""that's what the authorities think I need to do, then that might be an option,"" she said when asked on CNN's ""AC 360"" about taking a lie detector test. Hartley was on several CNN shows Thursday recounting what happened last week on Falcon Lake. She also talked about her feelings about people doubting her account of the alleged attack. Hartley said on HLN's ""Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell"" that ""I know what I know."" ""It's hard being judged and thought of that I might have done something to him,"" she said. But she added, ""As long as I know the truth, God knows the truth. And other than that, it almost doesn't really matter to me, because I know what happened that day."" Mexican authorities said earlier this week that they could not verify the shooting, and Hartley was asked point-blank on NBC's ""Today"" show Wednesday whether she had anything to do with her husband's disappearance. Pam Hartley, David Hartley's mother, said Tuesday that any suggestion that her daughter-in-law's account was inaccurate is ""insane."" Investigators have found some evidence that backs up Hartley's account, including blood on her life vest, Zapata County Sheriff Sigifredo Gonzalez Jr. said Thursday. And the incident was similar to other attacks reported by boaters on Falcon Lake, about 70 miles west of the Hartley's home in McAllen. Gonzalez has said the gunmen are typically teenagers hired by a drug cartel in the neighboring Mexican state of Tamaulipas. Mexican authorities have said the lake is controlled on their side by ""organized criminals,"" and the sheriff called on the Zeta cartel to turn over Hartley's remains if they have them. ""We just want a body,"" he said. Tiffany Hartley said she believes the attackers took her 30-year-old husband's body after he was shot in the head and fell off the personal watercraft he was riding. She said she suspects her husband's remains are more likely to have been dragged onto land than to have been left in the lake. ""We do believe if they would just go ahead and give us David's body back, it would be done. It would be concluded. We could go on with our lives,"" she said. Authorities from both nations are conducting separate searches and are coordinating and holding regular meetings, State Department spokeswoman Virginia Staab said. But because the alleged crime happened on the Mexican side of the border, the United States cannot prosecute or make arrests in the case, the sheriff said. Tiffany Hartley, 29, told HLN that the couple set out across the lake on personal watercraft for a sightseeing trip to Guerrero Viejo, a half-submerged ghost town on the Mexican side of the lake. Though there had been warnings about previous robberies on the lake, she said they had heard of no problems for several months, ""So we figured everything had kind of calmed down."" Instead, she said, they were pursued by men in three boats as they left the site's historic church. At first, ""they just waved at us like we were friendly, a very friendly wave,"" she said. But then, as the couple passed, she said they began chasing them and firing shots. David Hartley was shot in the head and fell off his personal watercraft, and he was unresponsive when she turned back to try to retrieve him, his wife said. While she was trying to haul him onto her craft, their attackers pulled up alongside, she said. ""They didn't say anything to me, so I don't know what they were trying to do ... but they left,"" she said. ""They just left me there. Thankfully they didn't shoot at me. They had a gun pointed at me."" Unable to pull her husband's body out of the water, Hartley headed back across the lake to U.S. waters. She said the gunmen fired ""a few more"" times on her way back. ""Once I started to get going, I just went as fast as I could and didn't look back until I couldn't see them anymore,"" she said. Rolando Flores, lead investigator for the Tamaulipas state police, described the area as ""a conflict zone."" The state has made headlines recently as a hotbed for drug cartel violence, and there have been at least four cases of gunmen in Mexican waters robbing or threatening boaters on Falcon Lake since April, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety. David Hartley worked for an oil company in Reynosa, Mexico, and the couple had lived on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande before moving back to the United States earlier this year, family friends said. His aunt, Alice Harrod, told HLN's ""Prime News"" the family had concerns about their safety in the area, ""and we were all thrilled to hear that they were moving back to Colorado,"" where they grew up. ""We're all very devastated. It's hard to even believe something like this could happen. We're hanging in there, but it's very, very difficult for the whole family,"" Harrod said. According to Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, 60 Mexican personnel, three boats and a helicopter have taken part in the search. Investigators resumed their work Thursday despite threats to their lives, and Cuellar suggested that the Mexican navy might need to be called in to help. Despite the dangers on the Mexican side of the lake, Texas officials on Thursday said that the U.S. side of the body of water remains safe. ""It is just as safe now as any other time. However, there is a threat,"" said Rep. Ruben Hinojosa, D-Texas. CNN's Justine Redman, Nick Valencia, Dave Alsup and Matt Smith contributed to this report.","NEW: Mexico says it has ramped up the search .

"(CNN) -- Maria Sharapova crashed out of the China Open on Tuesday, with the former world No. 1 suffering her second consecutive early exit. The 12th seed, beaten in her opening game in Japan last week, lost to fellow Russian Elena Vesnina in the second round to follow defending champion Svetlana Kuznetsova and last year's runner-up Agnieszka Radwanska in departing the $4.5 million Beijing event. Vesnina -- who lost their only other meeting at the 2008 Australian Open, which Sharapova won for her third grand slam title -- triumphed 7-6 (7-3) 6-2 to set up a clash with Switzerland's Timea Bacsinszky. ""I'm definitely not as good as I wanted to be,"" Sharapova told the WTA Tour website. ""After the U.S. Open I wasn't able to train as much as I would've wanted to, and I feel like the last couple of weeks I've just been trying to play catch-up. ""My rhythm hasn't been where it should be. Obviously it's disappointing, but I've lost and won many matches in my career. I'll just have to regroup and move forward."" The 21-year-old Bacsinszky progressed when eighth seed Victoria Azarenka of Belarus withdrew with a leg injury, trailing 3-2 in the second set after winning the opener 6-4. Second seed Vera Zvonareva will next face fellow Russian Maria Kirilenko in the third round following her 6-4 6-1 win over Germany's Andrea Petkovic, while French Open champion Francesca Schiavone also went through. The Italian fifth seed beat Slovenia's Polona Hercog 6-3 6-3 to set up a match with unseeded Russian Vera Dushevina. Dushevina's compatriot Elena Dementieva will play former world No. 1 Ana Ivanovic in the last 16, with the seventh seed defeating Japanese veteran Kimiko Date Krumm 6-3 1-6 6-3 despite serving 10 double-faults. Ivanovic battled back from 4-1 down in the second set to beat Olga Govortsova of Belarus 6-0 7-5. ""I realized I was sort of pulling back a little bit and wasn't as dominant as I was in the first set,"" the Serbian said. ""I had to stay calm and not panic, and not go for winners too soon. I'm really happy I managed to do that."" Ninth seed Li Na kept the home crowd happy with a 6-1 6-4 win over Russia's Alisa Kleybanova, while Israeli 15th seed Shahar Peer notched a 6-4 6-2 win over Switzerland's Patty Schnyder. Peer will next play Bojana Jovanovski, who upset fellow Serbian and third seed Jelena Jankovic on Monday. Top seed Caroline Wozniacki had a first-round bye and will open her campaign against Italy's Sara Errani on Wednesday.

"(CNN) -- A senior Australian police chief has a described an incident in which a man was Tasered 14 times while in police custody as ""unacceptable and extremely disappointing."" CCTV footage of the incident, which happened in Perth, Western Australia in 2008, showed an unarmed aboriginal man lying on the ground surrounded by police officers after reportedly refusing a strip search. The man survived the incident and was later shown the footage but declined to press charges. Two of the officers involved were fined A$1,200 ($1,149) and A$750 ($718) respectively but kept their jobs after an internal inquiry. Charges were dismissed against two other officers. ""Against all their training and procedures, two officers repeatedly Tasered a detainee because he wouldn't move when told, and all this while other officers watched,"" Western Australia Police Acting Commissioner Chris Dawson said in a statement. ""The community will obviously be disappointed when they see closed-circuit television vision today of what took place,"" he added. ""They were fortunate not to be sacked."" Taser guns emit an electrical current which temporarily immobilizes the victim by disrupting voluntary control of muscles. The disturbing footage was released as part of a report by the state's Corruption and Crime Commission into the use of Taser guns by the force. It said Tasers were used 3,070 times between 2007 and 2009, becoming the ""option of choice"" representing 74 percent of reported uses of force in 2008. But it said this incident highlighted a ""broader problem with respect to officers misunderstanding the circumstances in which Tasers could be used."" As a result, the state's attorney general called for police disciplinary procedures to be reviewed. ""There has to be some recognition that excessive use of force with a Taser is of a completely qualitatively different nature to just excessive use of force with your hands, if you like,"" Christian Porter was quoted by ABC News as saying. ""I think we've reached the stage now where Tasers are such important instruments for the police force that disciplinary proceedings for excessive use of force with a Taser need to be treated in a special category."" Meanwhile, police in Sydney are investigating the circumstances surrounding the death on Saturday of a man who was Tasered by officers called to investigate an alleged domestic incident. The man lost consciousness a short time afterwards and later died in hospital, ABC reported.","CCTV shows unarmed aboriginal man lying on the ground surrounded by officers .

"(Mashable) -- According to web analytics company StatCounter, Microsoft's Internet Explorer 6 is now truly a relic of the past with less than 5 percent market share in the U.S. and Europe. For years, IE6 caused headaches for developers and prompted many users to switch to alternative browsers. It was full of security holes, and it broke nearly every web standard in the book. Since it was the default browser on many Windows machines, it was also the dominant browser in the early aughts, reaching 90 percent market share in 2002 and 2003. Unfortunately, it outstayed its welcome by a good five years, keeping a solid chunk of the market share even after Internet Explorer 7 and 8 were released. Now, StatCounter's numbers, based on an analysis of 15 billion page views in May 2010, indicate that IE6 usage in the U.S. has fallen to 4.7 percent from 11.5 percent in the last 12 months, meaning that IE6 is finally becoming a footnote in the history of the Internet. As far as other web browsers go, IE8 holds 30.49 percent market share in the U.S., followed by Firefox 3.6 with 19.85 percent and IE7 with 16.64 percent market share.","IE6 usage in the U.S. has fallen to 4.7 percent from 11.5 percent in the last year .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Kenya marked the signing Friday of a new constitution expected to usher in major change, though the celebration swirled with controversy when Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, wanted for war crimes, joined the ranks of African leaders in attendance. Al-Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands, on allegations of war crimes and genocide in western Sudan's Darfur region, where violence that erupted in 2003 has left at least 300,000 people dead. Kenya, a signatory to the criminal court treaty, is obligated to hand over al-Bashir. ""The Republic of Kenya has a clear obligation to cooperate with the court,"" said a document filed by the court prosecutor's office Friday, adding that the court was informing the U.N. Security Council of al-Bashir's presence in Kenya. Al-Bashir was invited to the celebrations in Nairobi by the Kenyan foreign ministry in his capacity ""as the head of a friendly, neighboring country,"" said the spokesman for Prime Minister Raili Odinga. But the spokesman told CNN that he was ""shocked"" at al-Bashir's presence and that his attendance was ""out of the blue."" He also said that he had not spoken to Odinga but described the situation that developed as ""impossible."" Asked about Kenya's obligations to the international court to arrest al-Bashir, the spokesman said he did not think the Sudanese leader would be arrested on Kenyan soil. Human Rights Watch scolded Kenya for allowing al-Bashir to enter the country, saying that the wanted leader's presence would ""forever tarnish the celebration of its long-awaited constitution."" Pro-government militias known as the Janjaweed stand accused of ethnic cleansing in Sudan's Darfur region. Al-Bashir has denied that he helped armed the militias. Al-Bashir has traveled to several countries since the warrant was issued, including a recent trip to Chad. Friday he was among thousands of Kenyans at the signing of the new constitution three weeks after voters overwhelming approved the referendum. Debates over a new Kenyan constitution had spanned two decades, but intensified after postelection violence left more than 1,000 dead in 2008. ""For the last two decades, the people have yearned for a new constitution,"" President Mwai Kibaki said. Kibaki signed six copies of the constitution and held one up as the crowd erupted in cheers during the signing event at a park in the capital, Nairobi. The signing was followed by the national anthem and a 21-gun salute. Changes to the constitution include a more decentralized political system that minimizes the president's powers. It also calls for land reform and allows dual citizenship -- a popular issue with Kenya's large diaspora community. CNN's David McKenzie contributed to this report.","The Kenyan president signs a new constitution amid fanfare .

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- A Niger Delta leader arrested in South Africa after a bombing in Nigeria will be held separately from other prisoners until a bail hearing next week, his lawyer said Tuesday. A judge in Johannesburg court ruled Tuesday that Henry Okah will have his bail hearing October 14, said attorney Rudi Krause. ""The prosecution has indicated they plan to oppose his release on bail, but I am confident  our application will be successful,"" said Krause, who wanted Okah separated from the general prison population for his safety. Charged in South Africa under terrorism legislation, Okah is suspected of being a leader of the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, known as MEND, which took responsibility for the bombings that killed 12 and injured 50 in Nigeria's capital, Abuja, on Friday. The bombings came as the West African country celebrated 50 years of independence. MEND issued a statement Saturday saying it had given the Nigerian government advance warning and blamed the government for the deaths. The Nigerian Intelligence Service said Monday that nine people have been arrested and they were being questioned in connection with the blasts. Authorities are still seeking two men, identified as Chima Orlu and Ben Jessy, whom they accuse of being the ""masterminds"" of the plot. Sources close to MEND told CNN that the two men are ""not known to be MEND operatives or known to be active on the Niger Delta issue."" They also raised concerns about the nine other arrests, calling them an ""attempt by the Nigerian government to be seen to act."" Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has appointed Andrew Azazi, his former chief of defense staff, to be the country's national security adviser in the wake of the bombings, Jonathan's office told CNN on Monday. Jonathan later called the action a terrorist attack that was designed to ""disrupt"" the anniversary, presidential spokesman Imo Niboro said. But he said it had nothing to do with Niger Delta issues or MEND. MEND, which represents militants in the oil-rich Niger Delta, is an umbrella organization of several rebel groups. It has been battling the government for years over fairer distribution of the country's oil wealth. MEND said Okah had been harassed by authorities in South Africa, where he lives, but denied his involvement. ""Okah has never been involved in any MEND operations but has always been blamed for every attack, which is strange to us,"" MEND's statement said. MEND said the ""irresponsible attitude of the government security forces is to blame for the loss of lives."" ""The security forces were also warned one full hour to the first bomb blast ahead of the general alert sent to the media and told to steer the public from all parked cars which was not done,"" the group said in a statement. CNN's Nima Elbagir contributed to this report.","NEW: Henry Okah to be apart from other prisoners until bail hearing .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- A plea deal has been reached in the assault case against singer Chris Brown, defense attorney Mark Geragos said in a hearing Monday. Chris Brown, at court Monday, will serve five years probation and must do jail time or community service. Brown, 20, faced charges of assaulting his pop star girlfriend, Rihanna, following a row earlier this year. Under terms of the agreement, Brown will serve five years of probation and must serve 180 days in jail or the equivalent -- about 1,400 hours -- in ""labor-oriented service,"" said Sandi Gibbons, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office. He must also undergo a year-long domestic-violence counseling class, she said. Brown's sentence is comparable to other felony sentences when the defendant has no previous record, she said. ""This is not an easy sentence,"" Gibbons said. He must check in with a probation officer every three months. Brown had previously pleaded not guilty to felony counts of assault and making criminal threats in connection with an attack on Rihanna. But under the plea deal, he pleaded guilty to one count of assault with the intent of doing great bodily injury in connection with the argument inside a rented Lamborghini on a Hollywood street in February.  See a timeline of events in this case » . Rihanna, whose real name is Robyn Rihanna Fenty, made a brief appearance at the hearing -- after Brown had left the courtroom -- to hear Los Angeles Criminal Court Judge Patricia Schnegg discuss the issuance of a ""stay away"" order requiring him to stay 100 yards from her. Through her attorney, Rihanna had requested that such an order not be issued. But Schnegg refused that request, saying she would issue such an order but would revise it to 50 yards -- 10 yards if the two are at the same ""industry event"" together. Schnegg told Rihanna, who was wearing a black dress with white pearls around her neck, that she would consider lifting the order after Brown completes his domestic violence counseling but advised Rihanna not to contact Brown. Asked whether she understood, Rihanna said she did before leaving the courtroom via a back door. Rihanna's attorney, Donald Etra, said Rihanna made the request because she felt that a protective order in place, requiring that Brown not annoy or harass her, was sufficient. Schnegg said Brown could apply to have his supervised probation transferred to Virginia, where he maintains his legal residence. He also can complete his community service there, she said, but it would have to meet the court's standards. ""I want Mr. Brown treated as any other defendant who comes to this court,"" Schnegg said. She noted, however, that he has no prior criminal record. Gibbons, of the district attorney's office, explained that the judge wants Brown to work -- remove graffiti, for instance -- as part of his service. ""His sentence is not based on what he's available to do,"" Gibbons said. ""His sentence is what he's going to do, or he's going to go to state prison for four years."" Dressed in a light plaid suit, Brown answered ""guilty"" when asked his plea by Assistant District Attorney Mary Murray. Formal sentencing was set for August 5. After the hearing, Geragos said of Brown, ""as long as I've known him in connection with this case, he's wanted to take responsibility."" He said Brown is thankful to those who offered him support and noted that he is ""a kid who's never been in trouble before"" who wants to ""move past this"" and get out the message that domestic violence is not acceptable. Brown ""embraces this as an opportunity to get his life back on track and get his career back on track,"" Geragos said, adding that Brown will speak further after his sentencing. Etra said after the hearing that Rihanna ""was fully prepared to testify and she would have told the truth about what happened that evening."" He said she did not object to the plea agreement. Rihanna had not attended any of the hearings in the case but had been following the case closely, Etra said earlier. She did not file a complaint against Brown, but the prosecution's case was built on what she told detectives and on physical evidence collected from her, including photographs of her bruised and battered face. It was not Rihanna who called police but someone who heard her screams for help, according to a sworn statement by Los Angeles Police Detective DeShon Andrews. The statement, filed with the court to support a search warrant for cell phone records, described a brutal attack against Rihanna, allegedly by Brown. Andrews said the incident began when Rihanna, who was riding in the sports car driven by Brown, found a text message on his cell phone from ""a woman who Brown had a previous sexual relationship with."" ""A verbal argument ensued,"" followed by the physical attack, the statement said. It went on to describe the assault in great detail, saying Brown punched her numerous times and put her in a head lock, restricting her breathing and causing her to start to lose consciousness. He threatened to ""beat the s--t out of you"" and kill her, according to the statement, and also bit her ear and her fingers. Eventually, ""Robyn F. began screaming for help and Brown exited the vehicle and walked away. A resident in the neighborhood heard Robyn F.'s plea for help and called 911, causing a police response. An investigation was conducted and Robyn F. was issued a Domestic Violence Emergency Protective Order."" At the end of his statement, the detective said Brown sent a text message nine days later, apologizing. Brown also issued a public apology for the incident just days after his arrest. ""Words cannot begin to express how sorry and saddened I am over what transpired,"" he said in a statement released by his spokesman. ""I am seeking the counseling of my pastor, my mother and other loved ones and I am committed, with God's help, to emerging a better person.""

"London, England -- Federal investigators are en route from Pakistan to England to probe a betting scandal related to Pakistan's national cricket team, Interior Minister Rehman Malik told CNN. The Federal Investigation Agency officers are due to arrive in London on Tuesday, two days after alllegations surfaced that gamblers fixed part of a Pakistani match against England last week. None of the players or team officials have been arrested, but four were questioned by police, Pakistani national team manager Yawar Saeed said Sunday. Another man was arrested Saturday and released on bail Sunday. The news has stunned Pakistan, where cricket is ""not just a passion, it's a religion,"" said the op-ed editor of a leading newspaper in Lahore, Pakistan. ""This is tantamount to treason for a cricketing nation like Pakistan,"" said the journalist, Mehmal Sarfraz, saying: ""People here are devastated"" by the allegations. ""We may have our differences otherwise in day-to-day life, but cricket brings us together regardless of caste, creed, religion, or class structure,"" she explained. ""If the allegations are proved, the players should be banned from playing this 'gentleman's game' for life."" A British tabloid newspaper reported Sunday that two Pakistani players deliberately bowled ""no balls"" -- a foul -- during the four-day series. A ""no ball"" is when the bowler -- the equivalent of a pitcher in baseball -- steps over the line as he unleashes the ball. The batting team gets a run when that happens. The British tabloid News of the World posted what it said was a video of an undercover reporter meeting with a man identified as Mazhar Majeed, who tells the reporter exactly which bowlers would bowl ""no balls"" and when, then lays out 14 thick stacks of bills on a table. The video of the meeting -- which the newspaper said took place Wednesday, the day before the match between Pakistan and England began -- is intercut with clips from the following two days, where the players perform as Majeed said they would. The tabloid also says the alleged ringleader pocketed 150,000 British pounds (U.S. $232,800) in the scam. London's Metropolitan Police said a 35-year-old man was arrested late Saturday on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud bookmakers and released on bail Sunday. Police said no date had been set for a hearing or further proceedings, but that the investigation was continuing. A source familiar with the investigation named the man who was arrrested as Mazhar Majeed. Can Cricket survive in Pakistan ? Police questioned Pakistani team manager Saeed, captain Salman Butt, and two other players, Saeed told reporters Sunday. He did not name the other two players at the news conference, but Britain's Press Association earlier reported that he had said they were bowlers Mohammad Aamer and Mohammad Asaf. Police refused to confirm to CNN who was being questioned. The Pakistani players at the center of the scandal are free to leave the country, London's Metropolitan Police said Monday. Team captain Butt said Pakistan gave 100 percent throughout the match. ""We have given our best,"" Butt said after his team lost to England. The team manager refused to comment on the report that Pakistani players intentionally committed three fouls during the match. ""No allegations are true until they are proved either way,"" said Saeed. ""So that this point in time they are just allegations. Let's wait until the case is complete."" England beat Pakistan in the four-day match at Lord's cricket ground, which ended Sunday afternoon, after the scandal broke. Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari ordered an investigation into the scandal, his spokesman said Sunday. He directed the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board to submit a preliminary report ""immediately,"" Farhatullah Babar said, adding that Zardari asked to be kept informed about any British investigations as well. Sam Peters, News of the World's cricket correspondent, told CNN that the tabloid did not ""drive these events ... These events were going to happen regardless of whether the News of the World was involved."" But, he said, staffers believed the story was in the public interest. ""It's a legitimate story to get to the bottom of something that's been plaguing our sport,"" he said. ""... It's swirled around, and the innuendo's been there."" However, Shakil Shaikh, president of the Islamabad Regional Cricket Association, told CNN that while he is ""shocked"" at the news, ""no proof has been given of the involvement of these players in the match-fixing issue"" and he has seen no concrete evidence against the cricketers. He said if evidence does surface, an investigation will be launched. It is the second allegation of corruption directed at the Pakistan cricket team this year. News of the World does not allege that gamblers fixed the results of the England match -- only that specific moments in the match were fixed, a practice known as ""spot-fixing"" rather than ""match-fixing."" Betting on cricket matches is legal in England. The News of the World report was co-authored by Mazher Mahmood, a controversial figure in British journalism who has used undercover video in the past. He was responsible for a report in May that revealed Duchess of York Sarah Ferguson offered to sell access to her former husband, Prince Andrew.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Oskana Grigorieva's appearance on ""Oprah"" has been ""postponed indefinitely,"" a source close to Grigorieva said. A spokesman for Oprah Winfrey told CNN Tuesday ""We have nothing to announce at this time."" Lawyers for Grigorieva have ""ongoing communications"" with ""Oprah producers,"" said the source, who asked not to be identified since the source was not authorized to speak publicly about it. Grigorieva's visit with Oprah Winfrey ""was about to happen, but has been postponed indefinitely,"" the source said. She had done one interview with People Magazine but that is ""hanging in the balance,"" the source said. Her lawyers did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.

"Limpopo, South Africa (CNN) -- It's a tee shot so daunting even Tiger Woods might go weak at the knees. Not only is the extreme 19th hole at Legend Golf Resort in north South Africa 430 meters from tee to pin, it also 430 meters in height. Standing on top of a mountain only accessible by helicopter, the aim is to smash your ball onto the sloping green below which is shaped like the continent of Africa. Once you've hit your shot, 20 seconds of hang time awaits before you see if your drive has made it -- but fear not, if it is off target, a team of helpers with walky-talkies will locate your ball. Even then you might need to take a drop, if it lands anywhere near the many lions, elephants, buffalo, leopards or rhinos meandering through the bush. This hole is the crowning glory of the Legend signature course, a location that features 18 holes each designed by a different star of the game, including major winners Padraig Harrington, Retief Goosen and Trevor Immelman. ""It's very difficult to explain to people the drama of playing the world's highest and longest par three,"" Pete Richardson, head of PR and marketing at Legend, told CNN. ""You drive into a big-five game reserve to be picked up by a helicopter. You then fly to the top of the mountain, take a deep breath, look over the edge and see the green in the shape of Africa 400 meters below you. ""[At the top] you often see giraffe, rhino and hippo, and it's just very difficult to get your mind around it. You are in the middle of wild Africa, getting off a helicopter to hit a tee shot!"" Legend opened in 2009, and its unique 19-hole course has helped generate prosperity for an area that also benefited from the influx of tourists who flocked to South Africa for the 2010 World Cup. With over 600 local jobs created, according to Joe Motene from the Limpopo Department of Economic Development, the key priority for the development was for it to be built in a way that remained sensitive to the resident wildlife. ""The area has enhanced the natural environment and driven economic prosperity to an area which was previously mainly farm land with few long term sustainable employment and development opportunities,"" he told CNN. Richardson says the aim of the Legend resort was to create something unique and that the professional golfers he worked with all took to the idea. For those who believe in the old adage that golf is the perfect way to spoil a good walk, there are endless areas to explore on safari as John Dixon, public relations manager for the Legend group, and former park ranger, explains. ""The space, the vistas, the scenery alone, mixed up with getting up close to the big five game is something that is beyond words really,"" he told CNN. ""The big five, as we all know, are the iconic species that everyone comes to see, but there's a lot of general game species in terms of zebras, wildebeest, impala, giraffe, hippos, crocodiles, and a healthy populations of reptiles. ""You can never get bored of this, every time you go out it changes. There's always something new and exciting happening. You'll see something new in the mountains, you'll see something new from the animals, there's always a fresh experience waiting for you when you go out, whether it's a morning safari, an evening safari or a walk in the bush.""","CNN World Sport visits the most extreme hole in golf at Legend resort in South Africa .

"(CNN) -- English Premier League side Liverpool are a ""sinking ship"" under current coach Rafael Benitez, according to one of their players. Albert Riera joined the Anfield club in September 2008 on a four-year deal but has been a peripheral figure this campaign. Liverpool finished second in the Premier League behind Manchester United last season but the 18-time title winners haven't won a trophy since 2006. The club are currently in sixth place, 15 points behind league leaders United, were knocked out of the European Champions League in the group stages and dumped out of the FA Cup by second tier side Reading. Now Riera has laid the blame at Benitez's door in an interview with Spanish radio station Marca: ""When the coach says nothing to you and you are well, with no physical problems and training well, you cannot help but think it must be something personal. ""If I'm doing something badly and you are my boss, and you value me, then you are going to come and tell me what I have to do to play again. This is what hurts me. When you see a ship is sinking and don't do anything. ""It's a little frustrating because you see that you can help. I've been here two years and I know how he (Benitez) is. He's never sorted out a situation with a player by talking with him. He thinks he's in charge and everything else falls on deaf ears. His dialogue with the players is practically nil."" His comments were later criticized by former Liverpool and Germany international Dietmar Hamann, who made 283 appearances for the club between 1999 and 2006. He suggested to the UK Press Association that Riera wasn't in the team because his form hasn't been up to scratch since joining from Espanyol. ""I didn't read too much into the comments because he's a player who has not played too much football over the last six to eight months,"" Hamann said. ""He is clearly frustrated but you have to say since he signed for Liverpool he has not done enough to really have an opinion on the manager. ""If Riera is not in the team it is probably because he is not doing enough in training or in games. You have players these days who complain about managers and I think these players should look at themselves."" Riera is concerned that his lack of first-team football will affect his chances of going to the World Cup with Spain, and he says he is considering offers from Russian clubs. He added on Marca Radio: ""I would like to be here for the rest of my career, but players live to play. My objective is to go to the World Cup and for this I have to play. ""Right now the only market open is the Russian one, I have offers from two teams and, looking at my situation, that has made me reflect a lot.""","Liverpool are a ""sinking ship"" according to winger Albert Riera .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Six U.S. service members were killed in southern Afghanistan in the past two days, the NATO-led command said, making the death toll in July the deadliest month for American forces since the war in Afghanistan started nine years ago. On Friday, one service member died in an insurgent attack and the two others in an improvised explosive device strike, NATO's International Security Assistance Force said. On Thursday, IEDs killed two troops in one incident and another service member in another, ISAF said. Their deaths bring the July tally to 66. A total of 88 international service members, including Americans, have died this month. It is no coincidence that IEDs caused most of the latest deaths. Taliban militants regularly target troops with improvised explosive devices. The homemade bombs are considered the weapon of choice for insurgents in the Afghan conflict. The military regularly conducts raids targeting those who stage the attacks against troops. The latest grim milestone comes amid growing frustration among U.S. citizens over Washington's strategy in the Afghanistan war, the leak of thousands of secret documents about the war, and the dismissal of Gen. Stanley McChrystal as the top military commander. McChrystal stepped aside over inappropriate comments he made about some officials in the administration. Gen. David Petraeus took over the role. Coalition forces have intensified their war against insurgents, and militants have been tenacious in targeting U.S. and Afghan forces and those Afghans who participate in the political system. ISAF reported that a motorcycle rigged with explosives in Kandahar detonated outside the home of a parliamentary candidate on Friday, killing a woman and a girl. The bombing occurred when the candidate left his house but he was not injured. On Thursday, the son of an election campaign chief for a parliamentary candidate and another civilian died in an insurgent ambush, ISAF said. ISAF also said Friday that insurgents killed 13 Afghan civilians Friday. Coalition and Afghan forces have worked to apprehend people behind such attacks. Over the last 24 hours, troops detained insurgents in Helmand, Khost, and Paktiya provinces. A commander for the Haqqani network, an operation with links to al Qaeda, was seized in Paktiya. Discord that flared in Kabul on Friday illustrated the tensions between Afghans and Americans. Scores of people rioted in Kabul after a vehicle carrying four U.S. contractors was involved in an accident with a car carrying four Afghans. The U.S. Embassy in Kabul said it had been informed of deaths and serious injuries among the Afghan in the accident. After the accident, people burned the American vehicle and another going with it and they threw rocks at Americans, . ""The U.S. contract personnel cooperated immediately with local Afghan Security Forces ... who were on the scene and dealing with the situation. Our sympathies go out to the families of those Afghans injured or killed in this tragic accident,"" the embassy said. Approximately 75,000 pages of documents posted on Sunday by the whistle-blower website WikiLeaks has highlighted the challenges in fighting the war. The reports document attacks on U.S. troops and their responses, relations between Americans in the field and their Afghan allies, intramural squabbles among Afghan civilians and security forces, and concerns about neighboring Pakistan's ties to the Taliban. Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates both criticized the leaks. ""The sheer size and scope of the collection now demands a careful review to determine the degree to which future tactical operations may be impacted and the degree to which the lives of our troops and Afghan partners may be at risk. And I think we always need to be mindful of the unknown potential for damage in any particular document that we handle,"" Mullen said. Afghan President Hamid Karzai and U.S. military officials are angry that names of Afghans helping the coalition are in the documents. ""This indeed is very irresponsible and shocking,"" Karzai told reporters Thursday. President Barack Obama has announced plans to send 30,000 more U.S. troops, but has said he will start withdrawing American forces in July 2011. Before this month, June was the deadliest month for Americans and coalition forces. A total of 103 international soldiers died last month -- including 60 Americans. The totals are based on reports compiled by CNN.","NEW: Unrest hits Kabul after a traffic accident .

"(CNET) -- High-quality, high-definition videoconferencing is coming to the living room, but consumers should expect to pay top dollar for it. Today not one but two major technology companies will be announcing new videoconferencing products for the home. Cisco Systems, which already has a well-established telepresence line of products for large companies, and Logitech, which makes Webcams and other PC peripherals, each in separate press conferences plan to announce products that will bring telepresence videoconferencing to consumers in the home. For years, technology companies have been describing a day when grandmas halfway around the globe could dial in to a video call to watch their grandchildren take their first steps. Loved ones separated by oceans could share in all kinds of special moments via high-quality videoconferencing that makes them feel as if they are in the same room. Finally, the promise will soon be reality. As high-speed Internet access and high-definition TVs become more ubiquitous, and the cost of high-definition cameras and high-end processors comes down, the time is finally right for high-quality videoconferencing technology to come to the home. But even with price drops on these components and the ubiquity of broadband, getting this high-quality video experience won't come cheap. The Wall Street Journal reports that Cisco is expected to charge $600 for new hardware and a $30-a-month service fee for its home telepresence service. Other news outlets cite a lower-end Cisco solution that costs $200. If Cisco teams up with service providers, such as Comcast or Verizon Communications, it may offer the device for a subsidized price and make up the difference on monthly service fees. Regardless of exact pricing, the home edition of telepresence will be considerably less than the $100,000 the company charges large companies to set up telepresence conference rooms. Still, it may be too high for the average consumer, especially when much less expensive options are already available. For example, Skype offers free videoconferencing through its peer-to-peer service. People can use the Skype client on a computer or they can use it on an HD TV. Skype's service is already bundled into several models of high-definition TVs sold by Panasonic and Samsung that connect directly to the Internet. What's more, later this fall Microsoft will be adding videoconferencing to its Kinect motion controller for the Xbox 360 game console. This device also offers a camera and microphones, making it yet another inexpensive solution to the videoconferencing dilemma. And there are other low-cost solutions already available. For instance, Sony's PlayStation 3 also already offers online video chat. Cameras that can be used with Microsoft's Xbox 360 video chat solution and Skype's service cost about $150 a pop. Even though Cisco isn't officially commenting on its upcoming news, the company would likely argue that the price difference between what it plans to offer and what Skype offers comes down to quality. When Cisco first introduced its telepresence videoconferencing products for the enterprise, it bet that companies would pay for a higher-quality experience that made executives feel like they were sitting across the table from their virtual counterparts. Cisco was right. Its enterprise telepresence business has been growing steadily since it was first introduced four years ago. The life-like experience that Cisco promises with its technology certainly is not what people expect with less-expensive services from companies, such as Skype and Microsoft. Because the quality expectation is less, these services can get away with using the public Internet, and existing processing capability on devices like a TV, computer, or game console to offer the service. By contrast, Cisco is introducing dedicated hardware that will provide a much higher-quality service. And if reports of a Cisco $30 monthly service charge are accurate, the Cisco home telepresence service will not travel over the public Internet. Instead, it will likely be delivered over a dedicated sliver of bandwidth from a broadband provider that will guarantee a certain quality of service. (This is the same setup Cisco uses to offer its corporate customers service guarantees for its enterprise-class telepresence service.) What this means is that Cisco will likely offer consumers a high-end service, which would appeal to people who are willing to pay top dollar for better quality. And Skype and others may offer a less expensive option that addresses a different segment of the market. Pricing for Logitech's offering, which will be part of its Google TV launch, hasn't been revealed yet. So it's difficult to know if Logitech will fall in the lower-end Skype competitor category or if it plans to go after higher-end customers as Cisco is likely to do. ""We think there will be a range of products and services available based on quality,"" said Cullen Childress, senior director of product management for Polycom. ""This is already the case with a lot of products in the consumer electronics market. People expect to pay a lot more for quality and a better experience."" Polycom is one of Cisco's major competitors in the enterprise telepresence market. Polycom has already been offering a home videoconferencing service of its own. But the company has focused on business users rather than consumers. Its home office offerings range in price from $100 for a desktop software license to $10,000 for a hardware optimized experience. The difference in price is mainly dictated by the additional hardware and software necessary to guarantee a higher-quality experience, Childress said. Even though Polycom hasn't yet introduced a consumer product, the company is exploring the market. In January, it teamed up with IBM to demonstrate a consumer home telepresence system at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. IBM's smarter-home demonstration at CES included several different applications for the connected home via a cloud-based Internet service powered by IBM. The telepresence videoconferencing application demonstrated how Polycom's technology could be integrated with an HD TV to make and receive video calls. Polycom still hasn't announced a commercial consumer product. But Childress said that ensuring higher-quality video necessitates dedicated hardware, which would drive up costs. ""Software-driven experiences work on smaller form factors, such as on mobile devices and laptop screens,"" he said. ""But when you want to ensure quality, especially on a 50-inch screen, you'd want to do optimization with hardware."" Market getting more crowded . Even with a higher-quality service that may set them apart from low-cost solutions such as Skype, Cisco and Logitech will soon be competing in an increasingly crowded market. While Logitech has competed previously in the consumer market, Cisco has much more experience in the enterprise where cost is less of an issue. While it has consumer brands, such as its Flip video cameras and Linksys home Wi-Fi routers, Cisco has had a harder time hitting the sweet spot in terms of pricing for its home-grown consumer products. For example, its Wireless Home Audio offering introduced over a year ago, which is a suite of six products that allows users to share music in multiple rooms throughout their homes wirelessly, comes in three bundles that range from $550 to $1,000, a hefty price tag for a function some systems do for a lot less. © 2010 CBS Interactive Inc.

"(CNN) -- The Transport Ministry in Ghana has downplayed an incident involving two commercial jets at its main airport on Monday night which some media reports have described as a plane crash. Officials at the Kotoka International Airport say two airplanes, Lufthansa Flight 567 and Turkish Airlines Flight 624, tipped at the wings on the tarmac as the latter prepared to taxi for takeoff. According to Deputy Transport Minister Dzifa Ativor, the official version of events as she gathered after meeting officials of the Ghana Civil Aviation Authority and the Airport Company Tuesday morning suggests an ""incident"". ""It wasn't a crash, it was an incident. The 'crash,' I think was too harsh a word to use,"" she said. The accident has however raised questions about the ability of the airport to accommodate the several airlines that are being licensed by the Aviation Authority. Commercial oil production in Ghana is due to begin in the coming months, attracting more investors and other visitors. But Ativor, the deputy transport minister, said a project to expand the airport to enable it to admit bigger planes is under way. She disagreed that the incident could be the result of overcrowding. She added, ""the Ghana Civil Aviation Authority has set up investigations and they will be submitting a report to the ministry as early as possible. After that we will forward it to the accident investigation board to do an in-depth investigation so that we'll take steps to forestall recurrence of such incidents."" The minister says the Turkish Airline flight, which was grounded temporarily as a result of the incident, eventually took off and has since arrived safely at its destination. The Lufthansa flight was also suspended. But the airline's manager for Ghana, Yannick Aplogan, said the aircraft has since been certified as airworthy and will take off at 8:35 p.m. (3:35 p.m. ET) Tuesday. ""Our aircraft was in the parking position when the aircraft from Turkish Airlines which was taxing to the runway hit the winglet of our aircraft,"" Aplogan said. He added that, ""based on our internal processes we decided to cancel the flight to make further technical checks"". According to him there was no extensive physical damage apart from a dent at the point of impact. As many as 30 airlines including, United, Delta and Virgin Atlantic, operate from the Kotoka International Airport in the capital Accra. Turkish Airlines is one of the new airlines to have started operations from the Accra airport and there are more expected to commence before the end of the year. The Kotoka International Airport is known to have one of the safest air corridors in sub-Saharan Africa.","""It wasn't a crash, it was an incident,"" transport official says of Monday mishap .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thai police Wednesday linked a powerful explosion at a suburban Bangkok apartment building to anti-government protesters. The death toll from Tuesday's blast grew to four as investigators recovered an unidentified body from the debris at the site, the country's emergency center said. Nine people also were injured. Initial forensic evidence suggests the bomb was made from about 10 kilograms (22 pounds) of TNT and was being assembly at the apartment before it exploded, according to Gen. Wichean Potephosri, the national police chief, who said evidence found at the scene may link it to four other recent bombings. The country's Crime Suppression Bureau said the room where investigators believe the bomb was assembled was rented by an anti-government supporter from Chiang Mai, who is wanted on an arrest warrant in another bombing case. Tuesday's blast damaged the first and second floors of the Saman Meta Apartment building in Nonthaburi province, just outside the capital, Bang Bua Thong police said. The building has been sealed off while police collect forensic evidence, but authorities have said there is evidence of an explosive material at the site. The anti-government protesters are known as ""Red Shirts"" -- so named for the color of their clothing. On Tuesday, the Thai government extended an emergency decree in Bangkok and three provinces has been extended. The decree allows authorities to detain suspects without formal charges up to 90 days. The emergency rule was imposed in April after anti-government protests crippled much of Thailand. The extension of the emergency rule also come after another protest in September where more than 10,000 anti-government demonstrators gathered in the heart of Bangkok's shopping district to mark the fourth anniversary of a bloodless coup that ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. That peaceful demonstration lasted about four hours as one of the city's main intersections was again flooded with ""Red Shirt"" demonstrators. But that demonstration was a far cry from the bloody protests where Red Shirts amassed in the same area from March to May until a crackdown by the government's security forces left 91 people dead and more than 2,000 injured.","Police point to anti-government protesters in bomb blast .

"(CNN) -- India's dreaded ""Delhi belly"" hit a number of top swimming stars, as Australia continued to dominate at the Commonwealth Games on Wednesday. England's double Olympic champion Rebecca Adlington said she was struggling with illness ahead of Thursday's 800m freestyle final -- an event she won at Beijing in 2008. Her teammate Fran Halsall almost collapsed on the podium after winning a disappointing bronze in the 100m freestyle and then failing to reach the final of the 100m butterfly. Australia's Andrew Lauterstein pulled out of the men's 50m butterfly final due to a stomach complaint, but his compatriots won five more golds -- setting three records -- as the country moved to a leading 21 and 46 medals in total on day three of the event. ""It is hygiene-related,"" England team doctor Ian Gordon told the UK Press Association. ""They have been assiduous in their personal hygiene, [using] alcohol gels. But everybody is going down with this acutely, and it just happened to hit Fran today."" Halsall, who won the 50m butterfly and aims to swim in the 50m freestyle heats on Thursday morning, saw Alicia Coutts win her second gold this week ahead of fellow Australian Emily Seebohm. ""I don't think I'm very well, to be honest. I had tummy issues last night, and they carried on through today. I just didn't have anything to give,"" she told reporters. Adlington wrote on social networking website Twitter: ""Got a bronze on the 4x200 tonight! Girls did amazing! Very proud! Hoping I feel better tomorrow though, not flash at the min!"" Leisel Jones retained her 200m breaststroke title for the third successive Games ahead of teammates Tessa Wallace and Sarah Katsoulis, while the highly-rated Seebohm won the 100m backstroke from England's world champion and world record-holder Gemma Spofforth in a Commonwealth best time. Australia also set records in winning the men's and women's 4x200m freestyle relays. Another new mark was set by England's James Goddard in the 200m backstroke as he regained the title he won in 2002. Australians continued to dominate the cycling, though Malaysia's Josiah Ng ended their clean sweep of golds by claiming the men's keirin title when his teammate Azizulhasni Awang was disqualified for dangerous riding after finishing first. World champion Cameron Meyer won the men's points race, while 19-year-old Megan Dunn won the women's 25km event, and Australia also won the women's team sprint for a haul of six golds in two days. Hosts India remained second in the medals table with 11 golds, ahead of England on six, despite a disappointing day in the wrestling following Tuesday's clean sweep. Rajender Kumar retained his men's 55kg title, thrashing Pakistan's Azhar Hussain 11-0 in the final, but Sunil Kumar could only manage bronze in the 66kg after losing to eventual winner Myroslav Dykun of England. Manoj Kumar lost 7-2 to Nigeria's Joe Agbonavbare in the 84kg final, while Dharmender Dalal earned bronze in the 120kg division after failing to reach the final -- won by Australia's Ivan Popov, 8-0 against Talaram Mamman of Nigeria. The athletics program, which has been depleted by the withdrawal of several top names, opened with Uganda's Moses Kipsiro winning the men's 5,000m, as he held off Kenya's former world champion Eliud Kipchoge, the fastest over the distance this year. The men's 100m glamour event saw Jamaica's Oshane Bailey the fastest qualifier for Thursday's semifinals with a time of 10.12 seconds in the absence of his illustrious compatriots Usain Bolt and defending champion Asafa Powell. Natasha Mayers of St Vincent and the Grenadines was the fastest in the women's 100m heats, but her 11.33 was a long way off the Commonwealth best of 10.9. In the men's field hockey, world champions Australia thrashed Scotland 9-0, Pakistan beat Malaysia 4-1, New Zealand posted a second success in defeating South Africa 4-2 and Trinidad and Tobago crashed to another loss, 4-0 to England. In the women's event, top seeds England beat Canada 4-1 in Pool B, and in Pool A defending champions Australia won 2-1 against India in a repeat meeting of the 2006 final.","English swimming star Halsall cannot repeat gold-medal showing due to illness .

"(CNN) -- Sachin Tendulkar became the most-capped player in Test cricket on Tuesday as India began their battle to level the three-match series against Sri Lanka. The 37-year-old, known as the ""Little Master,"" took the field in the five-day format for the 169th time as he surpassed the mark set by former Australia captain Steve Waugh. Tendulkar did not have the immediate chance to add to his records of 48 Test centuries and 13,742 runs as Sri Lanka won the toss and decided to bat first at Colombo. The hosts reached 293-4 at the end of the opening day, with captain Kumar Sangakkara top-scoring on 75 and Thilan Samaraweera unbeaten on 65, while Mahela Jayawardene contributed 56. Opener Tharanga Paranavitana fell to Ishant Sharma for eight with the score at just 15, but Tillakaratne Dilshan added 87 with Sangakkara before falling just before the lunch break. Tendulkar hits double century as India head for Sri Lanka stalemate . Dilshan made 41 off 70 balls before being run out by close fielder Murali Vijay. Sangakkara was dropped on 23 by Suresh Raina off the bowling of Abhimanyu Mithun, but became the first of left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha's two victims on 157 when he was caught trying to loft down the ground. Samaraweera was then joined by Angelo Mathews (26), and they added an unbroken 53 against an Indian attack missing injured spinner Harbhajan Singh. Tendulkar adds biggest one-day score to his list of records . The tourists, who lost the first match and drew the second, conceded 22 extras and Harbhajan's replacement Amit Mishra was warned twice for running on the pitch. Meanwhile, former England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff has been ruled out for the rest of his country's domestic season as plans for his comeback from long-term knee problems ground to a halt. The 32-year-old has not played since the last Ashes match against Australia almost a year ago, when he retired from Test cricket to concentrate on limited-overs competitions. He has had two knee operations but is not yet ready to return, so will miss next month's Twenty20 Champions Trophy in South Africa with his Indian Premier League club Chennai Super Kings.","Sachin Tendulkar plays his 169th Test for India in third match of Sri Lanka series .

"Vicenza, Italy (CNN) -- He's only 25 now, an Army paratrooper stationed at the headquarters of the 173rd Airborne at a sprawling base near Vicenza in northern Italy. As the first living recipient of the Medal of Honor since the Vietnam War, Sal Giunta has had plenty of media attention heaped on him. But this staff sergeant is determined to make the medal, at least symbolically, belong to others. ""When I first heard that they were putting me in for the Medal of Honor, I felt lost, I felt kind of angry, I felt, I think, angry,"" he said in an exclusive interview. ""Just because, you know, this is so big. This is, it came at such a price. It came at the price of a good buddy of mine, not just Brennan. But Mendoza. Mendoza died that night as well. And people want to put a medal around my neck."" Giunta is talking about one of his best Army friends, Sgt. Josh Brennan, whose life he tried to save during a vicious firefight in eastern Afghanistan's Korengal Valley in the fall of 2007. Giunta's squadron, with Brennan walking as ""point"" -- or first man in the front -- was trapped in a deadly ambush by Taliban fighters during a nighttime operation. The squadron's medic, Hugo Mendoza of El Paso, Texas, was caught with the rest of the group. Share your tributes to Sgt. Brennan and Spc. Mendoza . ""People congratulate me on a good job when there's two people that have basically given their entire lives for this mission, for the Army, for the people of the United States of America,"" Giunta said. ""And now, I'm gonna be the one they are gonna shake hands with and congratulate? It didn't seem real and at the same time, what did seem real was that this shouldn't happen."" Giunta, whose armor-plated vest took a bullet during the ambush, saw Taliban fighters dragging away Brennan. Army documents say he immediately began to fire at the two men dragging his buddy away, killing one and driving off the other. Giunta pulled the badly-wounded Brennan to protective cover and stood by him until medical help arrived. Brennan, whose father is a policeman in Madison, Wisconsin, died from his wounds the next day. ""It is a great thing,"" Giunta said, speaking of the Medal of Honor. ""But it is a great thing that has come at a personal loss to myself and so many other families."" And that, he said, is what he wants Americans to know. ""Absolutely,"" he said. ""And not it's just the soldiers out there doing it. It's their families. It's their parents. It's the Mike Brennans of this world. And Mendoza's parents, you know. His brothers and sisters. The families that we leave when we go do this."" ""It's not just, we're gonna go fight, but we're gonna leave our families for a while and hope that they can be taken care of,"" the sergeant explained. ""It's a sacrifice that everyone makes, and these two men on that day made the biggest sacrifice anyone can ever make. And it's not for a paycheck."" Giunta's Medal of Honor ceremony will take place in November at the White House. And while his friends Brennan and Mendoza can't be there with him, he knows who can be. And he wants as many of his squadron mates as possible at the presentation.","Staff Sgt. Sal Giunta is the first living recipient of the Medal of Honor since Vietnam .
