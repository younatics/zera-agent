"Real Madrid: . Atletico Madrid: . Host commentator . That rather meandered along in the second half but Diego Simeone will be delighted. Atletico - thanks to substitute Arda Turan's late goal - have recorded back-to-back victories at the Bernabeu for the first time in their history. Cristiano Ronaldo had levelled earlier from the spot after Tiago gave Atletico the lead, but Real never got a head of steam. Problems for Carlo Ancelotti going forward. Click the link above to read Pete Jenson's full match report. Into stoppage time... only two minutes!! Greizmann should've finished it! Did Pepe a kipper down the right but only fires int the sidenetting! Big, big chance. Suarez yellow card after bringing down Modric. Are we to get a quality ball in? Kroos... and Moya wanders out to collect. Deary me. Miranda has a yellow to his name now as Real Madrid push forward... free-kick on the edge of the box, right-hand side. James Rodriguez must step up and deliver. Clipped in with no conviction. Awful. Booking for Modric now as the visitors stand over a decent set piece here. Wasted though. Five minutes to go. 83mins: Ronaldo now shooting from anywhere. Desperate for Real Madrid, this, and Atletico will just throw bodies in front of those efforts. If Atletico manage to hang on for the next ten minutes it'll be the first time ever they've won consecutive league matches at the Bernabeu. Real look to be lacking ideas here, worryingly for Carlo Ancelotti. Good area on the right. Needs a delivery... but Kroos' centre is palmed away by Moya. Well, I did say it suited Atletico and it's Arda Turan who's put the visitors back in front! A nice stepover by Raul Garcia inside the box and the substitute sweeps into the far corner. Wonderful, wonderful passed finish. Those 50 (yes, fifty) travelling fans are delirious. This has opened up somewhat, which suits Atletico on the counter you would've thought. And Arda Turan again! Juanfran's whipped cross isn't met by the substitute and Arbeloa heads over for a corner. Chance! Arda Turan cuts in from the left, opens his body up and just drives wide! 72mins: Here comes Isco, replacing the largely ineffectual Gareth Bale. Into the final 20 minutes now and we've barely had a chance after the break. I won't lie, this has disappointed me since eight o'clock. And how Hernandez picks up a yellow card. This is ridiculous! Seven for the night. Javier Hernandez, by the way, scored on his debut for his previous two clubs. Arbeloa in the book now! It's not been that kind of game really. Changes: Hernandez on for Benzema and Greizmann is on for Gimenez. Real panic stations with Ramos at the back who hacks for a needless corner. Godin gets above his marker - Pepe, incidentally - at the back post but nods over. Chance for Bale but his header floats into Moya's arms. Rodriguez's centre was too drifty and behind Bale. Meanwhile, Arda Turan is coming on for the booked Gabi. A little bit niggly here. Atletico trying to slow the game down, but they have a free-kick in an advantageous position. Ah, but it comes to nothing. They aren't potent enough, with Mandzukic not wining enough in the air. 54mins: Booking for Gabi, who tactically hauls down Rodriguez as he rampaged on the counter. Clever. Bit of territory for Atletico now. Juanfran launches a throw-in towards the six-yard box but the hosts easily clear. 51mins: And there's another from way out - this time from Pepe - that flies over. Tepid start. 47mins: First shot in anger during this second half and it comes from James Rodriguez who blasts over from 30 yards. Right, here we go. Will Atletico come out more? They kick us back off and clear to touch. Ominous. The referee has blown slightly early there. Bit odd. Anyway, Tiago gave Atletico the lead with a superb near post header early doors before Ronaldo bought - then scored - a penalty to level it up. Real have been guilty of missing a number of opportunities and should be leading here. Atletico have - somewhat disappointingly - sat in and absorbed too much pressure here. Was expecting them to come out a little bit more. Mandzukic in the book for a late one in midfield as Real win a corner. Pepe tries to steer towards the back post but nothing comes of it, despite Ronaldo's best efforts. They're getting closer though... Benzema tries to make amends for that fluff before but slides an effort wide after nicely cutting inside on the edge. Can't have helped that half the Bernabeu were jeering him as he shaped to shoot. Madness. Horrible touch Benzema! Ronaldo streams forward on the left, plays in the Frenchman who has all the time in the word but he miscontrols and Moya is out to thwart him. Really poor, that. Well, I expected Real to flood forward after the goal but it's been a fairly subdued five minutes or so. Ronaldo doesn't miss many, and he sends Moya the wrong way to level it up. Cool as you like. Game on! Ronaldo goes over the challenge of Siqueira and it's given! Could barely hear the whistle and it's barely a foul. Think Ronaldo has bought that. Godin hauls down Ronaldo on the edge and picks up a booking for his troubles. Good area this... Ronaldo over it. Surprise, surprise. Oh, no! It's Bale! And what a save by Moya, diving to his left to deny the Welshman. Vicious dip and swerve. Poor from Gabi, who gives away the ball in his own third, but Real cannot capitalise - largely because two or three defenders then harry to win back possession. Tame header is comfortably saved. The Bernabeu is a touch restless. James Rodriguez is in the book for protesting after not being awarded what appeared to be a clear free-kick on the edge. Harsh. Juanfran marauds down the right and earns a corner. Can Real defend? They struggle again but Benzema eventually hooks away. Very nervy at the back. Chance for James Rodriguez - teed up by Ronaldo - but he can't direct a tricky volley towards goal. The Colombian struck it into the ground and it bounces harmlessly over. You fancy that Real need a quick reply. 14mins: Ronaldo looks a touch miffed at that early goal, drives at the away area, but flashes an effort over the top. Good from Siqueira down the left... corner... and GOAL! Thiago was ignored at the near post - Coentrao, Benzema and Ronaldo the guilty parties - and he nods home from a wicked Koke delivery. First bit of work for Casillas, who plucks a Koke cross out of the air confidently. Different goalkeeper this season! Atletico are superb at pressing high and forcing mistakes. We've seen that already as the visitors turn possession over in Real's third. This is not only one of the biggest clashes in Spain, but on the continent now. I was lucky enough to be in Lisbon for the Champions League final a few months ago and you don't realise how much this particular fixture means until you sample it first-hand. So here we go at the Bernabeu, Real get us underway... Well done all. Casillas; Arbeloa, Pepe, Ramos, Coentrao; Modric, Kroos, James; Bale, Cristiano, Benzema .

"What's Mario Balotelli up to now? Liverpool’s £16million striker was sporting an odd new look at training. Whether the 24-year-old carried on training like this was unclear but it had echoes of when he struggled to put on a bib during his time with Manchester City.

Mario Balotelli appeared to have problems keeping his shorts up as he trained at Melwood . Mario Balotelli missed Italy's 2-0 win over Norway as he was serving a one-match suspension . Ayre said: ‘Having the right people allows the club to maximise signings like Balotelli, . leading to £50,000 worth of shirt sales.’ Liverpool face Aston Villa this weekend, who, after an impressive start to the season, currently sit a point ahead of Brendan Rodgers' side in the table.

"Netflix tweeted a quip about corrupt law enforcement to promote their new show Peaky Blinders that has some critics reeling. 'Just because you’re law enforcement doesn't mean you’re law abiding. #PeakyBlinders,' read the tweet posted on Wednesday from Netflix's official account. It came the same day that a grand jury opted not to indict a white NYPD officer who was accused of killing black father Eric Garner with a choke hold. In the wake of protests against the grand jury's decision not to indict both Darren Wilson who killed Mike Brown and Daniel Pantaleo who killed Mr Garner, scores of critics expressed their disdain for the tweet.

"CLICK HERE to read Martin Samuel's match report on heartbreak for City at the Allianz Arena . Two or three minutes before the end of this game – shortly before Jerome Boateng's hammer blow put Manchester City on the seat of their pants – their midfielder Fernandinho crumpled to the ground with what appeared to be cramp in both calves. It didn't last long but it was telling. The Brazilian had, after all, spent most of the night doing his own job and a fair share of the bloke's who was playing next to him. The case of Yaya Toure and City is certainly a curious one. One of the Barclays Premier League champions' success stories, the Ivorian's standing at the Etihad Stadium is nevertheless not quite what it was. Yaya Toure appeared to neglect his defensive responsibilities during City's 1-0 loss to Bayern Munich . Fernandinho (L) was left exhausted and out of position as he tried to cover for his midfield partner . Toure, at the age of 31, remains a formidable footballer. At full tilt at the front of one of City's rapier breaks from their own half, he can be imperious, almost unstoppable and as destructive as a lorry with its brake cables cut. Nevertheless, football is about more than scoring and creating goals. Even teams as blessed as City have to defend, even Europe's most gilded teams have to do their work without the ball. They have to have the appetite, the mobility and the lung capacity. To look at Toure these days is to wonder about that part of the deal. When City do not have the ball, he can look laboured and slow to anticipate. Turning towards the opposition goal doesn't seem to be a problem whereas turning towards his own certainly does. It would be wrong to question his desire. Toure appeared to struggle against small, nimble footed players like Bayern Munich's Juan Bernat . Former Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso beats the Ivorian to the ball in a 50-50 challenge at the Allianz Arena . Certainly he made an ass of himself in the summer with his self-indulgent moans about birthday cakes (the lack of) and a supposed (for that read 'imagined') lack of sympathy shown him by the club following the passing of his brother. Nevertheless, he remains a footballer committed to his role. What is troubling is whether Toure can physically meet the challenge these days when City are forced deep in to their own half, confronted by intelligent, energetic footballers that come at you in numbers at places like the Allianz Arena and, closer to him, Stamford Bridge and Anfield. Toure was playing at the Etihad Stadium last season when Chelsea swarmed all over the City midfield on their way to a victory in the Premier League. He looked lost that day and once again here last night he looked in trouble again, particularly in the first half. Toure is left on the floor as David Alaba takes the ball from him during City's heartbreaking loss . Former Manchester City defender Jerome Boateng celebrates after scoring a dramatic late winner . Joe Hart is comforted by Boateng after managing to keep Bayern Munich at bay until the bitter end . Without Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben in their starting eleven last night, Bayern played rather differently. Their threat during an opening half hour they dominated came centrally via the nimble work of Thomas Muller, Xabi Alonso and Mario Gotze. At this time Fernandinho badly needed Toure alongside him to track the runners and shield their central defenders from the red shirts. Too often, Toure was slightly out of position or too slow to read the play. We are talking half a yard or a split second but, at this level and against these players, that is sometimes the difference between a goal and an attack snuffed out at source. As the game wore on, Toure did improve. He was not even his team's worst player. Twice towards half-time, Toure turned defence in to marauding attack with a sharp turn and a trundle upfield that allow City to impose their own attacking patterns on a Munich defence that did not always look terrible secure. Toure is under even greater scrutiny after a summer punctuated by some ill-advised comments . Vincent Kompany must help City recover before their next game against Premier League leaders Chelsea . Ultimately, though, Toure had questions asked of him on Wednesday night that he couldn' t always answer and his coach Manuel Pellegrini will have noticed. Toure has faced these questions before. He faced them last season and answered them metaphorically and literally. 'I hear what people say and I prove them wrong,' he said at a press conference earlier this year. As he gets older and the City squad grows ever deeper, however, Toure will perhaps come under greater scrutiny. Pellegrini bought another central midfielder – the Brazilian Fernando – in the summer and it is tempting to wonder if he would have played last night had injury not intervened. There are always other roles for Toure, of course. He can be a devastating second striker, for example. Fernandinho certainly may not miss him in his current role.","Bayern Munich defeated Manchester City 1-0 in Champions League opener .

"Dressed in army fatigues and posing with a machine gun, this military enthusiast yesterday became the second man to be arrested on suspicion of stealing war memorabilia. Daniel Mackay’s home was raided yesterday by police searching for artefacts that may have been illegally dug up with the help of metal detectors and removed from heritage sites. Mr Mackay, 35, from Bicester, Oxfordshire, was pictured online posing with his wartime finds and featured in a macabre YouTube video entitled ‘Exhumation of German soldiers in 2014 Kurland,’ an apparent reference to a Second World War battlefield in Latvia. In the video he is referred to as a military archaeologist. Daniel Mackay’s home was raided yesterday by police searching for artefacts that may have been illegally dug up with the help of metal detectors and removed from heritage sites . An Army bomb squad carried out a controlled explosion of historic munitions at Mr Mackay’s home at 1.30pm yesterday. Police would not give details about the items involved in the explosion . The video was posted in June by 48-year-old Alan Tissington, whose home 40 miles away in St Albans, Hertfordshire, was raided by police on Wednesday, when a massive cache of guns, bullets, bombs and shells was discovered. Sources close to the case said the men knew each other and went to European battlefields and ex-military sites in the UK with metal detectors most weekends. An Army bomb squad carried out a controlled explosion of historic munitions at Mr Mackay’s home at 1.30pm yesterday. Police would not give details about the items involved in the explosion. Detective Inspector Steve Raffield said the operation was in its early days and the search of the terraced house was likely to continue for several days. ‘It looks like World War One and Two munitions and memorabilia,’ he said. ‘It is going to take quite a while to work out what they are.’ Leah Cato, 32, who lives on the same street as Mr Mackay, said: ‘It’s been crazy. I woke up this morning to see police tape and police cars. ‘I thought “Oh my God, what’s going on?” We didn’t know anything. It wasn’t until I saw the bomb disposal unit that I realised what it was.’ The mother-of-three said that she and her family felt the controlled explosion at the top of the street, adding: ‘It was a massive explosion. I was inside but had the back windows open,’ she said. ‘It really scared my little boy.’ Police who raided a house in St Albans on Wednesday found a cache of firearms and ammunition in a garage . Arranged against the far wall of the garage housing the memorabilia was a collection of artillery shells . Another neighbour, who did not wish be named, said she had often taken deliveries for Mr Mackay. ‘He receives a lot of post and a lot these parcels are marked from Germany,’ she said. Thames Valley Police said that it is ‘a criminal offence to retrieve artefacts from the ground through using a metal detector if the land is a protected site or without permission of the landowner.’ A spokesman added: ‘As a result of information following warrants executed in St Albans, Hertfordshire, to target the theft of heritage artefacts and munitions, Thames Valley Police has arrested a 35-year-old man from Bicester this morning on suspicion of theft. ‘A quantity of First and Second World War munitions were located, as a result of the arrest, at a residential address. The man was arrested on suspicion of theft from heritage and protected sites and is currently in police custody. ‘It is suspected that the arrested man obtained these artefacts through illegal metal detecting, which is a heritage crime.’ A spokesman for English Heritage said the police operation ‘sent a clear signal’ to those involved in digging up wartime weaponry without permission.

"Harry Redknapp has reassured Queens Park Rangers fans by insisting he will sign a new contract imminently. The R's boss revealed three weeks ago that a new two-year deal had been offered. Although Redknapp has not signed on the dotted line yet, he remains relaxed about the situation and claims it is just a formality. QPR manager Harry Redknapp still hasn't signed a new  contact, but he insists he will do so soon . The former Tottenham manager said: 'Yes, I haven't signed it yet. I could do it today. I just need to get down to the ground and get it signed. It's all been drawn up.' Redknapp's side host Stoke this weekend and the 67-year-old  revealed that he has made moves to sign their striker Peter Crouch. QPR are woefully short of options up front after losing Loic Remy to Chelsea during the summer transfer window. Redknapp has admitted  he is still keen on signing Peter Crouch to bolster  QPR's attacking options . Goalkeeper Rob Green looks frustrated as QPR were thrashed 4-0 by Manchester United in their last game . On Crouch, Redknapp added: 'He started at QPR and I took him to Portsmouth from here. 'I've managed Crouch at most places I've been to. 'He's a player we've spoken about a few times - you'd always have Crouchy, he's a great bloke and a great player - but nothing came of it.' One player that Rangers were able to sign in the summer transfer window was midfielder Sandro, who arrived on deadline day for £10million from Tottenham, and Redknapp said Spurs  rejected 'four or five million more' from Russian club Zenit St Petersburg. 'I was surprised we were able to get him to be honest, and that he wasn't playing more,' said the one time West Ham manager. 'I think Tottenham turned down a big bid from Zenit just before the start of the season. 'It was certainly four or five million more than we paid for him. Redknapp was delighted to sign Brazilian midfielder Sandro from Spurs for £10million on deadline day . 'So I couldn't be more pleased to have him, he's a great character, a good lad and I think he'll be a great player for QPR.' Redknapp added though the Sandro still needs time to reach full match fitness. 'I don't know long he'll need to be up to full speed,' said the Rangers boss. 'But he hadn't played at all and there's nothing like matches, until you get on the pitch you can't bring it all together. 'It's taking on the nerves, the adrenaline, all the training in the world doesn't compensate for playing in 90-minute games, and that's what several of them lacked. 'Sandro will be fitter against Stoke than he was last week and he's going to be a great player for us.' Stoke Boss Mark Hughes returns to Loftus Road on Saturday after being sacked by Rangers in 2012 . Saturday's clash with the Potters also sees former Rangers manager Mark Hughes return to Loftus Road, and Redknapp said the Potters' boss must be held responsible for his unsuccessful spell at the club. He said: 'Mark will take blame for what happened here - manager's have to. It didn't work out for him here, but that's football'","Harry Redknapp says he will sign a two-year  contract with QPR soon .

"I’ll be honest with you. It’s an unlikely story. But then again, so was coming back from 3-0 down against AC Milan, with three goals in six minutes and then winning the Champions League on penalties as a result. One Night In Istanbul is a new British comedy caper film (adapted from the popular stage play) based around Liverpool’s triumphant night in the Ataturk Stadium in 2005. That was an evening of incredible thrills, spills and heightened drama. The film doesn’t match up to those exacting standards, it has to be said. But it does have an honest heart beating at the centre of it. And it does do a decent job of tapping into the whirlwind of emotions that being a diehard football fan is all about. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . One Night in Istanbul is driven by the character of Tommy, who is played by Steve Waddington (right) Caught up in the middle of the story are two down-on-their-luck cabbies, Tommy and Gerry, who, by fair means, but mainly foul, contrive to get to Istanbul with their sons for the game. Prolific star of the big and small screen Steven Waddington is Tommy, whose story drives the film along. While Paul Barber - to whom we should all remain eternally grateful for bringing the world Denzel - plays his pal. And gets to be the moral compass AND steal the best laughs in the process. Their journey from Liverpool to Turkey, and back again is fuelled by the likes of a slavering loan shark, a ‘free spirited’ ex wife, Turkish gangsters, stolen artifacts, police raids, and a big bag of money. None of which ever manages to be anything other than what you’ve seen many times before. The film documents the club's Champions League victory in 2005 where they came back from 3-0 down . After Steven Gerrard's header, Vladimir Smicer and Xabi Alonso scored to take the game to extra time . But that is just about ok, because director James Marquand pushes the whole thing along at a fair lick, so there is no need to brood too long on the flimsy nature of the characters and events. However, there is more. And it’s the more that just made the whole film just a bit too untidy for me, at times. Because there is also the story of Tommy and his son using the journey to rekindle their fractured relationship - through frequent acoustic guitar-based song! While there’s the mawkish sentimentality of Tommy’s dead dad’s frequent appearances. The film taps into the emotions Liverpool fans were feeling during the historic final against AC Milan . Carragher and Gerrard kiss the Champions League trophy after that dramatic victory against Milan . And seeing as this is no Hollywood blockbuster, the cast of thousands is probably more like a couple of dozen. So the crowd scenes do feel a little sterile. Nevertheless, and in spite of these reservations, as I say there is some genuine pluck and spirit at the core of this film. The two leads work very nicely off of each other in particular. While Samantha Womack, who plays Tommy’s ex-wife Carmella (with lavish scouse accent attached) gets to share some screen time with a newcomer to the big screen - one Robbie Fowler. Suffice to say, Morgan Freeman can sleep easy when they’re casting for God in future silver screen projects. One Night In Istanbul may indeed be the tall tale of one particular football club’s night of triumph, and the supporters who celebrated it. But there is plenty going on in this film that speaks to the football fan in all of us. And it does so with if not exactly huge laughs, but then certainly at least a cheeky, knowing wink.

"Host commentator . It's all over in Belgrade and Partizan have been well worth their point this evening. Kane smacked the crossbar in the early stages, but that was to be the closest Tottenham would come. The home side were dangerous on the counter-attack and caused Spurs a few problems without ever seriously testing Lloris. 88mins: Lloris is on course for his fourth clean sheet in seven games here as the game slowsl into a canter. The crowd are still bouncing up and down but it hasn't quite been enough to sing their side to victory. Spurs play the ball around the back before Kane loses an aerial battle. THREE minutes to go. Sami Mokbel: Just clocked a worrying banner amongst the Partizan supporters that reads: 'Only Jews and P******' - a play on words on Only Fools and Horses. Surely one for UEFA to look at in the coming days. 85mins: Luka is shown a yellow card after a late challenge on Capoue. The substitute was unlucky as he looked to have won the ball but Capoue's play-acting was enough to convince the referee. 82mins: Kane fires a tame free-kick into the Partizan wall as Spurs look to gain an advantage in the closing stages. Salzburg are level and it's thanks to a beautiful free-kick from Soriano. Gordon was left scrambling in his goal as Soriano lifted the strike up and over the wall. 73mins: Ilic blazes over after the ball falls kindly at the edge of the Tottenham box. If there's going to be a winner in Partizan, it looks likely to be the home side. 65mins: Lamela has injected a bit of pace into the Spurs attack, but Partizan continue to frustrate the away side. Lazovic wins a controversial corner after a tackle from Lennon. Pressure on Spurs here. The returning skipper has put his side ahead with a 25-yard volley! Unfortunately, it's not quite as wonderful as it sounds as Brown's scuffed strike took a deflection before bobbling in. But the Celtic fans won't care! Petrovic comes on for Volkov as Partizan make the first change of the game. 52mins: Partizan are starting to put pressure on Spurs during the early stages of the second half. Dricic looks lively and almost puts his side ahead after brilliant work from Pantic on the left. Luckily for Spurs, his shot was tame and Lloris could collect easily. 48mins: Ben Davies is shown a yellow card for a late tackle on Dricic, but the free-kick comes to nothing as Lloris clears. We're back underway in Partizan and Salzburg as the two British clubs look to grab their first three points of the season. Sami Mokbel: Not many positives for Spurs after that first-half. They lacked ideas going forward. Ben Davies struggled at left back and Andros Townsend picked up a needless booking for dissent. It can only get better for Spurs after that. The scores are level at half-time as both Tottenham and Celtic are held by Partizan and Salzburg respectively. Tottenham's best chance came after just three minutes as Kane smashed a left-footed shot against the crossbar. At the other end, Lloris has been forced into action on several occasions after quick counter-attacks from the Partizan frontline. 42mins: Tottenham are having lots of controlled possession, but they've been unable to turn that into chances. Partizan look threatening on the counter-attack and Spurs may be happy to see the half-time break as Lloris saves a shot from Grbic. Many eyes will be on Federico Fazio this evening to see if the debutant can help plug gaps in a Tottenham defence that never quite replaced Ledley King. So far the combination with Jan Vertonghen looks no better or worse than solid, although Fazio was rather fortunate to see Partizan have a chance blocked from point blank range after completely mid-judging a headed clearance. Andros Townsend has just been booked for dissent, with Pochettino now feeling the need to come to the touchline to overlook his now struggling side. And it's all square in Salzburg as Alan scores for the home side. The strike took a huge deflection off Celtic's Efe Ambrose. 34mins: Andros Townsend is shown a yellow card for losing his temper with the linesman after a foul on Volkov. Moments later, Townsend looks to have led with is elbow as he comes together with Volkov once again. The winger needs to calm down here. 30mins: The ball bobbles around the Partizan box before the ball drops kindly to Kane. The young striker lines up a left-footed volley, but can only blaze his effort over the bar. At the other end, Ilic volleys over after an attack along the right leaves Spurs looking a bit light defensively. 0-0! 26mins: Concern for Spurs as Partizan come close to taking the lead before Hugo Lloris pulls off a point blank save to deny Lazovic. Danny Rose's last trip to Serbia wasn't a pleasant one, and his replacement this evening in Ben Davies is not quite enjoying it neither - albeit for different reasons. Davies has already given the ball away a couple of times, and Partizan are finding it a little too easy to breach the Spurs back line by attacking the right flank. Tottenham are starting to wobble after a good opening 10 minutes. 21mins: Over in Belgrade, Tottenham have survived one Partizan scare after a good cross from Ilic was cleared to safety. At the other end, it's been slim pickings for Spurs as Townsend looks lively. The Bhoys have the lead thanks to a brilliant left-footed strike from Wakaso. He found space in the Salzburg penalty area before rifling the ball past the Salzburg goalkeeper. 10mins: The first 10 minutes are up in in Salzburg and Celtic are putting a bit of pressure on the home team. A Commons free-kick results in a Celtic corner before Salzburg manage to clear. Good start for the Bhoys . 7mins: Townsend bombs down the right before finding Paulinho who gives the ball away. The crowd are getting right behind their team as the game settles down inside the first 10 minutes. 3min: Tottenham have their first chance of the game and it's Harry Kane with a strike against the crossbar. He worked the ball well onto his left foot inside the penalty area before thundering a striker onto the upright. That certainly would have silenced the crowd early on... And we're underway in Serbia and Tottenham take kick-off. The Partizan fans are already creating quite an atmosphere despite the running track between themselves and the pitch. There's just 150 travelling fans here in Belgrade today, perhaps the potential for supporter clashes has something to do with the lack of numbers. One Partizan supporter has just whipped out a Scotland flag! It's a big issue where ever you go. The teams are out as we prepare to get this evening's 6pm kick-offs underway. Tottenham (all in yellow) step out onto the Partizan pitch as the local fans send a few jeers their way. Speaking to ITV4 ahead of kick-off, Pochettino says: 'We have a strong sqaud and I said on the first day that we believe in all of our players. For different reasons some players are in London. 'It's important for the team and this is my first game in the Europa League. We expect a good performance. Getting three points is the most important thing.' A look back at 1991 from a football perspective conjures up memories which give a stern reminder of just how much football really has moved on. (Sir) Alex Ferguson still hadn’t won a league title with Manchester United, the class of ’92 were still yet to rip through the youth level of the game and the Premier League didn’t exist. In addition, an English manager was about to win the top flight title with a now second tier club and even the England team were actually rather good. Click here to read more... Celtic XI v FC Salzburg: Gordon, Ambrose, Denayer, van Dijk, Izaguirre, Brown, Johansen, McGregor, Commons, Wakaso, Scepovic . Mauricio Pochettino has claimed winning the Europa League is a priority this term, so he's done what any manager looking to back up his claims would do... make 10 changes. Only Hugo Lloris features from Spurs' 2-2 draw at Sunderland with defender Federico Fazio making his debut, and Benji Stambouli in the team for his first start. It's a gloriously warm and sunny evening in Belgrade and the PA system in the ground is doing its best to kick the home fans into a frenzy. Heavy rock music is playing around the ground - but with the capacity yet half full, it's not really having the desired effect. Spurs vs FK Partizan: Lloris, Naughton, Fazio, Vertonghen, Davies; Bentaleb, Stambouli; Lennon, Paulinho, Townsend; Kane .

"The FA have upset England‘s hardcore travelling support before the World Cup kick-off by reversing the importance of home and away attendance at games. A revamped England supporters’ club now receive two caps for going to a Wembley game with one awarded for watching the side abroad, when it used to be the other way around. The number of supporter caps determines your place in the queue for tickets for Euro 2016 in France when there is likely to be unprecedented demand due to the proximity of the host country and ease of travel. Upset: The FA have upset England fans by reversing the importance of home and away games . But those fans cheering England in Miami this week before moving on to Brazil are angry that their loyal - and expensive - support away from home will be downgraded. The FA do not hide the fact that filling Wembley is their priority, especially during the next two years of an unappetising qualifying tournament. Research also showed that a  significant proportion of the away fan base do not go to home matches. An FA spokesman said: ‘Any football club would have the same approach.’ Hurt: The FA have their work cut out if they want David Beckham back on side after his London Olympics snub . FA insiders believe they still have a job to do to bring David Beckham back on side following the brutal way manager Stuart Pearce rejected him for the GB team at the London Olympics. Beckham was widely considered a certainty for the squad having been named on the long list by Pearce. However, the Beckham camp have no issues with the current FA regime as was shown by the former England captain making a brief visit to the team hotel after arriving in Miami last Friday to wish the party luck in Brazil. Friends: The atmosphere inside the England camp seems to be particularity upbeat . Every England side approaching a major tournament are said to have the best team spirit ever but evidence suggests Roy Hodgson’s Brazil squad have bonded particularly well. Shirts put out for players to sign for the departing John Stones and Jon Flanagan were autographed by all the remaining 23 bound for Rio. And whereas England teams in the past were full of club cliques, players have been  joining the table of whoever is in the dining  room at the time, rather than just sitting with club-mates. Experience: Beckham's journey into the Amazon will be shown on Monday night . The Beckham Amazon jungle documentary to be shown on BBC on Monday features many extraordinary sights. None stranger than members of the Yanomami tribe who tie their stretched foreskins to a waist string. Beckham said: ‘They did. It’s part of the culture.’ Becks sticks to Plan M . David Beckham is still hopeful he will find the right downtown waterside site for his Miami football stadium despite the unexpected level of opposition to his venue plans - and of the effort required to see the project through. He said:  ‘We have come up against a few businesses that are opposed but we will find the right site. It’s a lot of work on the politics side which I’m not used to doing and it’s harder than expected. 'There were always going to be difficulties with the sites but I’m confident we will put the  stadium in a place Miami people deserve.’ Beckham, who continues to talk to basketball superstar LeBron James about joining his ownership group, will target big names in football. ‘That’s the attraction of Miami,’ he said. ‘Numerous players, including former team-mates, have contacted me and we’d love great players coming here.’ Hot work: ITV's England coverage, hosted by Adrian Chiles, was watched by 7.5million people .

ITV ride out the storm . The World Cup curse of ITV continues. The later kick-off for the Honduras match - due to the Britain’s Got Talent final - meant the match was interrupted for 45 minutes during the first half because of an electrical storm. However, it still attracted a healthy peak  audience of 7.5million.","FA reverse importance of home and away attendance at England games .

"UEFA are set to launch a formal investigation into the anti-Semitic banner that marred Tottenham's goalless draw against Partizan Belgrade. The banner displayed among the Serbian supporters during the Europa League tie read: ‘Only Jews and Pussies’ — an allusion to the TV comedy Only Fools and Horses. Delegates from European football’s governing body were made aware of the banner before half-time, yet no effort was made to take it down. VIDEO Scroll down to see Partizan fans riot in 2007 . A 'Only Jews and Pussies' banner among the home supporters in Partizan Stadium on Thursday night . The 'Only Jews and Pussies' banner was an allusion to the comedy show Only Fools and Horses . Tottenham, who have a strong Jewish tradition, are expected to make an official complaint within the next 48 hours. Anti-discrimination body Kick It Out meanwhile has urged UEFA to send a clear message to clubs around Europe after the incident. Kick It Out said it had been made aware of the unsavoury scenes via a ‘large number’ of Spurs fans on Twitter and confirmed it had informed Football Against Racism in Europe (FARE). FARE said it has made an official complaint to UEFA, who is officially awaiting the match delegate’s report. ‘These incidents seem to be happening in particular countries and in certain parts of Europe where they don’t take them as seriously as we do on our shores,’ Kick It Out’s media and communications manager Richard Bates said. Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino condemned the anti-Semitic banner . A pitch invader is detained during the Europa League clash in Belgrade on Thursday night . ‘Incidents aren’t dealt with in the appropriate manner within those countries - if they don’t take a firm stance and they’re allowed to slide, the reality is it will continue to happen. ‘We need UEFA to take a lead, which they have done more over the last couple of years, and demonstrate clearly that these sorts of incidents are completely unacceptable.’ Bates added: ‘It’s always disappointing when any incident like this occurs. ‘It’s disheartening, it’s not acceptable in any way and, after a thorough investigation, it needs to be dealt with in the appropriate manner.’ Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino branded the banner as ‘unacceptable’ and ‘disrespectful’. He said: ‘I didn’t see (it) but the club is aware. It is very disrespectful. It is a shame as it was a great atmosphere. It is very disrespectful, unacceptable and a massive problem for us.’ If Partizan are found guilty they could have part of their ground shut for European competition. There was a large police presence in the stadium despite only 150 Spurs fans making the trip . They were kicked out of this competition when it was the UEFA Cup in 2007 after crowd trouble marred their first qualifying round tie at Bosnia’s Zrinjski Mostar. On the pitch, this match was less eventful. As goalless draws go, this was pretty awful. But Pochettino knows it could have been worse. But for a 10-minute spell at the start, Partizan dominated without finding the goal their performance probably deserved. Pochettino made 10 changes from the side who started against Sunderland on Saturday, Hugo Lloris the only survivor from the 2-2 draw. There were full debuts for summer signings Federico Fazio and Benjamin Stambouli, while Harry Kane was handed another chance to impress ahead of Roberto Soldado. Tottenham striker Harry Kane rattled the crossbar from a tight angle with a thunderous shot . Andros Townsend is thrown off the ball by Partizan's Vladimir Volkov . On Wednesday night, Pochettino insisted the Europa League is a priority for Spurs, although a host of first-teamers did not travel. Spurs fans need convincing, however: just 150 made the trip. Kane nearly gave them something to shout about in the first minute, hitting the crossbar with a sharp angled shot after Partizan failed to deal with Ben Davies’s corner. Partizan, who have won all five in their league this season, gradually found their stride with Miroslav Vulicevic and Petar Grbic, in particular, causing Spurs problems down the right. Danko Lazovic saw his shot blocked by Fazio in the 15th minute following excellent work from impressive right winger Grbic. The Argentine manager had left regular left back Danny Rose in England; he may have regretted that given Davies’s difficult start. Andros Townsend tried to shift the flow of the game, but his runs down the right were too few and far between for Pochettino’s liking. On the half-hour Grbic again eluded Davies before picking out Sasa Ilic at the back post, only for the Partizan captain to blaze over. Left back Ben Davies was given a start in Tottenham's first Europa League game of the season . Roberto Soldado of Tottenham Hotspur shoots wide with an acrobatic attempt on goal . Davies’s nightmare continued three minutes after the restart as he was booked for hauling down Grbic. Lloris denied Grbic twice before Pochettino decided enough was enough, throwing on Erik Lamela and Soldado. But Partizan continued to pour forward: Sasa Ilic sent a shot from outside the area over the bar before directing a diving header at goal after 76 minutes. Kane’s 25-yard free-kick straight at Partizan’s wall in the 83rd minute summed up Spurs’ night in an attacking sense.

"A mother-of-nine earning £38,000 a year in benefits who is pregnant again with twins today revealed she plans to be sterilised. Cheryl Prudham, 32, and her husband Rob, 29, are set to earn another £1,400 a year when the twin baby girls are born - and that will see their handouts rise to a staggering £40,000. But part-time carer Mrs Prudham, of Gravesend, Kent, has insisted she will not be made to feel guilty for having more children - and plans to get a sterilisation, so she can focus on her career. Family time: Cheryl, 32, and Rob Prudham, 29, at their previous home with their children George, 14, Jack, 13, Caitlin, nine, Maisie, eight, Millie, six, Madison, five, Leon, three, Lenny, two, and Lainey, one . She said: ‘For one, I work more hours than what they are saying and two, I'm going to be sterilised. I'm going to have a caesarean and I'm going to get sterilised at the same time. ‘I'm glad that I am pregnant with twins and I am amazed by it. It’s not anybody else's business. I do a job that most people couldn't do. I care for the elderly every single day.’ Mrs Prudham added: ‘I don't give a s*** if people are on my side or not. I don't care. ‘It is actually no one else's business about what I choose to do in life. It doesn't matter what you say people are still going to judge you. They are still going to bad mouth you. ‘I don't care what people think, it is my choice that 11 children are going to be more than enough. Obviously I want to carry on my career and things like that.’ Income: Mrs Prudham, 32, and her husband are set to earn another £1,400-a-year when the twin baby girls are born. And that will see their handouts raise to a staggering £40,000 . The parents, who used to live in a tiny home in Sittingbourne, Kent, first demanded a home last year after hearing about other families on benefits who had landed huge properties. They repeatedly bid for new council homes through Kent Homechoice, which works alongside Kent County Council. However, they were left furious when they were turned down by the authority. Instead they agreed a house swap with a family living in Gravesend, Kent who wanted to downsize. But Mrs Prudham told last week that she is unhappy with the new £200,000 home - because they do not like the new neighbourhood. She added: ‘We've been here for about three months but I'm not really happy with the new house. We've got enough room but it's just we had to move out of Sittingbourne and we liked it there. ‘But there was nothing available there so I had to do a mutual exchange here and I don't really like it here to be honest. I'm not going to be able to go back to Sittingbourne.’ Nine children: Part-time carer Mrs Prudham, of Gravesend, Kent, has insisted she will not be made to feel guilty for having more children - and plans to be sterlised, so she can focus on her career . Mrs Prudham had her first son George, 14, when she was still just 17 and was living in a homeless hostel in Kent in the summer of 2000. Cheryl and Rob Prudham split the day by working 20-hours a week each which brings in a total of just under £1,400 a month. Their wages are topped up with £70 a week in working tax credits while their £123-a-week rent is paid for by the council. The pair also receive £7,326 a year in child benefit and £400 a week in child tax credits. It means the pair's annual income is £52,722 - £38,000 of which is benefits - which is £18,000 more than the average working UK household. Now they are due to receive £1,400 a year more in child tax credits for the birth of twins. She soon moved into a flat with her ex-boyfriend and had second son, Jack, 13, and her eldest daughter Caitlin, nine. But the mother then had three unplanned pregnancies - Maisie, eight, Millie, six, and Madison, five. In March 2009 she met her current husband, and they had Leon, three. They then had Lenny, two, before having daughter Lainey in January last year. Both parents work with as part-time carers and said working 20 hours a week entitled them to a new home. Speaking last year, Mrs Prudham said: ‘I see other people in the paper and it makes me sick. They shouldn't just get a new home handed to them on a plate. It gives people with big families a bad name. ‘I don't want people to judge us because we have so many children. If I sat on my a*** I would understand people would have something to say. We would probably earn more on benefits.’ Old home: The former home of Robert and Cheryl Prudham in Teynham, Kent. The family agreed a house swap with a family living in Gravesend, who wanted to downsize . The mother also revealed she and her husband did not like using contraception - and she had a number of her children by mistake. 'I don't give a s*** if people are on my side or not. I don't care' Cheryl Prudham . Mrs Prudham added: ‘In the past I have been on contraception but I got pregnant with the coil and the pill just doesn't settle well with me. 'We don't use condoms and me and Rob have never talked about it. I did rely on benefits before but I am motivated to be more than a mother.’ The pregnancy comes six months after the couple said on Facebook that they were going on a two-week holiday paid for by the taxpayer this summer.","Couple set to earn another £1,400 a year when twin baby girls are born .

"Cesc Fabregas made Premier League history after becoming the  first player to assist a goal in six consecutive games. The Chelsea midfielder's run follows on from his spell with Arsenal, when he set up goals in his final two top-flight games for the Gunners before departing for Barcelona in 2011.

"Manchester United's shortcomings in defence were ruthlessly exposed by Leicester City on Sunday as Louis van Gaal's woeful start as manager continued. While United were mesmerising going forward, they were absolutely shambolic at the back and conceded five goals. The £150million lavished mainly on forward-thinking players over the summer has left the team looking imbalanced and some of that money would have been better spent on a world class centre half. They did buy Marcos Rojo for £16m but he looked out of his depth at the King Power Stadium.

"Roger Federer has his sights set on ending the year as the world's top-ranked player after the 33-year-old claimed his fifth title of the year in his home town on Sunday. The 17-times grand slam champion outclassed David Goffin 6-2 6-2 to win the Swiss Indoor tournament in Basel for a sixth time, moving ever closer to Serbian Novak Djokovic at the top of the rankings in the process. A strong finish at the Paris Masters and the ATP World Tour Finals could see him end the year as number one for the first time since 2009 -- proof that his skills are not in decline despite the advancing years and two sets of twins. Roger Federer wins his sixth Basle title as he eyes up the World number one spot . 'It would be very special, you can't say it's not important, world number one, it's what it's all about really, together with some tournaments you really care about,' Federer told the ATP's official television channel after his 51-minute thrashing of Goffin. 'With the year I've had and the amount of finals I've played, the level of tennis I've played, I'm really pleased that I have a shot at being there. 'But I'm sure Novak will be very motivated. It's going to be interesting weeks ahead.' Federer celebrates his win in Basle with ballboys and ballgirls from the tournament . Federer, whose 302 weeks as world number one is a record, as is his streak of 237 consecutive weeks atop the rankings, is less than 500 points behind Djokovic with a combined 2,500 points up for grabs in Paris and London. Djokovic won both of those titles last year and therefore cannot significantly add to his haul as he will be defending points, while Federer lost in the semi-finals at both events and can potentially close the gap. Federer was at his majestic best at times against Goffin, the Belgian who has rediscovered his best form since Wimbledon, winning 43 out of 45 matches, including on the Challenger Tour, to rocket up the world standings. The Swiss star was delighted with his straight sets victory over David Goffin . He was never in with a chance against Federer though as the local boy delighted his fans with a faultless display to take his career title tally to 82 and extend his winning streak to 12 matches after his title in Shanghai. The first two of those wins came as Federer helped steer Switzerland into the Davis Cup final against France.","Roger Federer extends his winning streak to 12 matches .

"A Pennsylvania teenager charged with the gruesome murder of a man she met along with her husband through Craigslist has claimed to have killed more than 22 other people across the country in a jailhouse interview. In the local newspaper piece, Miranda Barbour, 19, claims she will plead guilty to the butchering of Troy LaFerrara, 42, in November in addition to more than 20 victims from Alaska to North Carolina as part of her involvement in a satanic cult. 'I feel it is time to get all of this out. I don't care if people believe me. I just want to get it out,' Barbour told the newspaper for a story published Saturday night. 'When I hit 22, I stopped counting,' she said on the paper's website. She now just wanted to be honest, she said. Serial killer: Miranda Barbour made the stunning revelations yesterday . Sunbury police Chief Steve Mazzeo told the newspaper that investigators have been in contact with the FBI and law enforcement in several other states. 'From information we gathered and from information gathered from her interview we are seriously concerned and have been in contact with the proper authorities,' Mazzeo said. Lawyers for the couple did not immediately return messages from The Associated Press left at their offices Saturday night. An FBI spokesman referred questions to its Philly office, but an email message wasn't immediately returned. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against Barbour and her husband, 22-year-old Elytte Barbour. Authorities said Miranda Barbour, a petite woman with long brown hair, told investigators she met the 6-foot-2, 278-pound victim after he responded to her Craigslist ad offering companionship for money. Accomplice: Elyette Barbour allegedly told police he and his wife wanted to kill together . Over the course of the deeply unsettling interview, Barbour claims that she is ready and able to cooperate with authorities to reveal where the bodies are buried. 'I can pinpoint on a map where you can find them,' she said. Claiming to have been sexually abused at the age of four, Barbour told the Daily Item that she only killed 'bad people' and was brought up in a satanic cult by a man she would not identify after joining them at the age of 13. Indeed, it was this individual who introduced Barbour to murder - killing a man down an alley in Alaska with a gun. 'It was in an alley and he (the cult leader) shot him,' she said, declining to identify him. 'Then he said to me that it was my turn to shoot him. I hate guns. I don’t use guns. I couldn’t do it, so he came behind me and he took his hands and put them on top of mine and we pulled the trigger. And then from there I just continued to kill.' During her time in the cult, Barbour claims that at one point she fell pregnant and was subjected to a dangerous 'in-house abortion' by members after they drugged her and tied her to a bed. Barbour has said that the majority of the murders she committed were in Alaska, but that she has also killed in North Carolina, Texas and California. Victim: Miranda Barbour said Troy LaFerrara, left, was still alive when she was searching for a place to dump his body. Pictured above with his wife Collen on their wedding day in 2011 . After leaving Alaska as a high-ranking member of the satanic cult, Barbour said that she will tell police anything they want to know about the murders. Asked why she pleaded not guilty to the LaFerrara muder, she replied, 'I didn't want to.' 'When I was at my arraignment and the judge asked me how do I plead, I was ready to say guilty and my attorney (chief public defender Ed Greco) grabbed the microphone and said not guilty.' Miranda Barbour said she has not spoken with her husband since the day she was arrested. 'He is proud of what he did,' she said. 'I will always love him.' 'I know I will never see my husband again and I have accepted that. I know I wanted to talk about all this because I know I had a 20-year window where I would possibly get out of jail and I don’t want that to happen. If I were to be released, I would do this again.' Police allege in court papers that Elytte Barbour told investigators they committed the crime because they wanted to kill someone together. 'Natural born killers': Miranda Barbour (left), . 18, and her 22-year-old husband, Elytte (right) are seen in handcuffs . after being arrested in connection to the 'thrill killing' of Troy . LaFerrara last month . She said in the interview that she doesn't want to get out of jail and that she would kill again if she were released. These confessions from Barbour follow the graphic details she gave police about married Troy LaFerrara's last moments. Barbour told police in December that LaFerrara was still alive and 'choking and gasping for air' as her and her husband tried to find somewhere to dump his body after stabbing him 20 times. Initially, Miranda told police that she killed La Ferrara in self-defense after he started to grope her. But her 22-year-old husband Elytte Barbour gave police a different story, saying they conspired to kill a stranger together, and he helped hold La Ferrara down while his wife wielded the knife. Miranda Barbour was the first to be arrested when police traced LaFerrara's last call to her cell phone. She was charged last Wednesday in his death, followed by her husband on Friday. Investigators said Elytte Barbour confessed to police the couple planned the killing. He previously told The Daily Item of Sunbury his wife acted in self-defense when LaFerrara, who was married, groped her after hiring her as a ‘companion.’ According to authorities, Miranda advertised herself as a 'companion' on Craigslist and LaFerrara responded. She arranged to pick him up on November 11 at a mall, three weeks after her marriage. Elytte Barbour says he hid in the back of the car under a blanket until the moment his wife gave him a signal. Sex worker: The teen-mom's husband said he knew about her habit of meeting men on the internet and sleeping with them for money . He held LaFerrara back with a cable cord while his petite, bespectacled spouse repeatedly stabbed him. LaFerrara's body was discovered the next morning in an alley by Sunbury resident Brittany Settler. After dumping their victim's body, the Barbours when to Wal-mart to buy garbage bags, carpet clearer, paper towels and seat covers to clean out the SUV - but it wasn't enough. 'She related that there was a lot of blood and she wasn't able to get it all,' police said. After that they went to a strip club to celebrate Elytte's 22nd birthday. The Barbours had recently moved from North Carolina to Pennsylvania after tying the knot October 22. LaFerrara married his girlfriend of eight years, Colleen Keeney, in June 2011. The couple did not have children. Death wish: Barbour told detectives that he and Miranda had plotted to kill someone in the past, but without success . According to his obituary, LaFerrara was employed as the senior resident engineer at the Lycoming County Landfill. The couple's arrests comes after Richard Beasley was given the death penalty in April this year after luring three men to an Ohio farm by using Craigslist job posts before killing them in cold blood. Mr Barbour has been charged with criminal homicide, aggravated assault, simple assault and criminal conspiracy and possession of instruments of crime. The 22-year-old man told police that he and his wife had plotted to kill someone in the past, but without success. It was not until they came across LaFerrara on Craigslist that their plan finally came together. Miranda Barbour offered little detail on the murders she claimed to have participated in in Alaska, Texas, North Carolina and California. She claims she joined a satanic cult in Alaska when she was 13 before moving to North Carolina. Online records for the woman that the newspaper identified as Barbour's mother show her as having lived in both Alaska and North Carolina. Last week, a judge granted a lawyer's request to have a forensic psychiatrist evaluate Miranda Barbour. The judge earlier approved a psychiatrist to evaluate Elytte Barbour.

"A Dallas man committed suicide Wednesday by decapitating himself after writing a message on the side of a van possibly referring to the violent first-person shooter video game Call of Duty: Black Ops. Hugo Rodriguez, 35, tied a rope to a fire hydrant and wrapped the other end around his neck before getting behind the wheel of the van and pressing the gas pedal. Before ending his life in such a grisly manner, the man scribbled a cryptic message on the side of the vehicle. The first two words appear to say 'no code' in Spanish, while the second part 'Codbo' could be a reference to the first-person shooter game Call of Duty: Black Ops. Horrific: A man killed himself in West Dallas by decapitating himself in his van. Before the horrific act he wrote a message believed to be in Spanish on the side of the vehicle . Witnesses described how he then got into his van and put it in drive at the intersection of Singleton Boulevard and Vilbig Road.. His body was thrown out of the vehicle and was seen lying on the street by passing drivers. According to CBS DFW, the defaced van eventually came to a stop without running into any cars or pedestrians. Witnesses described on social media how the headless body was still in the road hours later as police cleaned up the gruesome scene. The message the man wrote on the side of his van could be related to computer game Call of Duty Black Ops . The van was eventually taken away while a cordon of patrol cars surrounded Mr Rodriguez's body. Police are now investigating the incident but revealed that no one else was hurt. In the aftermath, shocked witnesses posted images online purportedly showing the victim still on the road. Call of Duty Black Ops is a version of the computer game franchise that releases a new edition almost every year. It is a first-person shooter that was developed in 2010 and is set in the Second World War and the Cold War. Gamers are armed with machine guns, rifles, pistols and grenades and play a fast-paced game of kill or be killed. Last year, a coroner in Britain stated that four teenage suicides were partly to blame on versions of the game. A spokesman for the Dallas Police Department told MailOnline: 'Witnesses observed the victim, Hugo Rodriguez a Latin male  tie a rope around a fire hydrant and then around his neck. 'He got into his van and accelerated, causing the rope to tighten around his neck and decapitated himself. A suicide offense was documented.' According to records he had been arrested a number of times for driving while intoxicated. A telephone listed at his address had been disconnected. To speak to a skilled, trained counselor, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline on 1800 273 8255.

Norwegian mass killer Anders Breivik claimed he had ‘trained himself’ to kill his 77 victims by playing Call of Duty. French terrorist Mohammed Merah also played Call Of Duty before killing three soldiers and four civilians – including a rabbi and three children – in Toulouse in March 2012. The violence in Call of Duty has been criticised by the London Jewish Forum, the British Muslim Forum and Church of England ministers. Call of Duty 3 shows soldiers running through London while bombs explode and buildings crash to the ground. In one controversial scene a soldier causes a Tube train to derail and explode. Other graphic scenes show aerial attacks on New York and grenades exploding in Paris and Berlin. When news of the Certificate 18 game's content was revealed it was panned by Mediawatch UK as being in 'incredibly poor taste'. Call of Duty 2 also caused outrage when it was revealed players could kill 'civilians'. There are currently at least 40million active players across all of the Call of Duty titles.","Body of Hugo Rodriguez, 35, was found in West Dallas on Wednesday .

The Meningitis Research Foundation estimates there are around 3,200 cases of meningitis and septicaemia every year in the UK. They are easily mistaken for milder illnesses, but unlike a dose of flu can kill within hours and may cause serious, life-long disabilities. As many as one in ten of those affected will die and a third of survivors will be left with after-effects, some as serious as brain damage, amputations, blindness and hearing loss. Vaccines have almost eliminated some types of meningitis but not all of them children are currently vaccinated against Hib, MenC and 13 strains of pneumococcal meningitis. A MenB vaccine (Bexsero) was recommended for infants in the UK in March 2014 and is available privately but a timetable for implementation free of charge on the NHS is yet to be confirmed. The UK Government has also introduced a new MenC booster campaign aimed at students starting university. GPs can administer the vaccine free of charge until 31 October 2014. The booster campaign will be repeated every year until 2017. Source: Meningitis Research Foundation .","The Hope for Harmonie campaign has raised half its target of £40,000 .

"Hillary Clinton said on Thursday she was pleased the U.S. Department of Justice was investigating the recent deaths of unarmed black men in incidents with police. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said on Wednesday the Department of Justice would launch a civil rights investigation into the chokehold death of Eric Garner in the New York City borough of Staten Island in July. There is also a federal probe into the fatal shooting of Michael Brown by a white policeman in Ferguson, Missouri, in August. Grand juries in both cases decided not to indict the officers involved, sparking protests. Supports investigation: Hilary Clinton said she backs a federal investigation of the death of two unarmed black men and said that the tragic events highlighted 'some hard truths about race and justice in America' 'Our hearts are breaking, and we are asking ourselves: 'Aren’t these our sons, aren’t these our brothers?'' Clinton told the Massachusetts Conference for Women in Boston. 'I’m very pleased the Department of Justice will be investigating what happened in Ferguson, what happened in Staten Island. Those families, those communities, and the country, deserve a full and fair accounting as well as whatever substantive reforms are necessary to ensure equality, justice and respect for every citizen.' She said the events in Ferguson and Staten Island highlighted 'some hard truths about race and justice in America.' 'Despite all the progress that we have made together, African-Americans, particularly African-American men, are still more likely to be stopped and searched by police, charged with a crime, and serve longer prison terms.' 'I personally hope these tragedies give us an opportunity to come together to find balance again,' she said. Clinton, who lost the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008 to Barack Obama and served as his secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, is considered her party's front-runner if she runs again for the White House. She has said she will make up her mind early next year. Investigation: U. S.

"'The Black Amish': Alan Beiler, 35, was born in Brooklyn, New York, but adopted by an Amish family and speaks the Pennsylvania Dutch language . A star of the quasi-reality TV show 'Amish Mafia' has been sentenced to up to two years in prison for drug possession and leading police on a high-speed chase last year that resulted in a Pennsylvania State Trooper being injured. Alan Beiler, who calls himself 'the black Amish,' is an actor and producer of the popular Discovery Channel show about the supposed 'dark underbelly' of the Amish community in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. In July 2012, five months before 'Amish Mafia' debuted, a Pennsylvania State Trooper tried to pull Beiler over for having an expired registration on his 2004 Jeep Liberty. Instead of stopping, Beiler accelerated and began driving in the oncoming traffic lane. Police . say he nearly rammed into five cars along the way.

"The charity behind the aid convoy from which ISIS hostage Alan Henning was kidnapped is being investigated over alleged links to militants, it has emerged. Father-of-two Mr Henning was seized by jihadists in Syria while attempting to deliver aid and now faces death at the hands of ISIS executioner 'Jihadi John'. It emerged today that a charity involved in the mercy mission he took part in is now being investigated over alleged links to those fighting in the region. There is no suggestion Mr Henning, 47, knew of the alleged connections between the charity and fighters. An investigation was launched into the charity behind Alan Henning's aid mission after this photo emerged apparently showing Adeel Ali, the son of one the organisation's trustees, alongside two armed fighters. Mr Adeel has insisted the photo is not of him . It is not suggested Mr Henning (pictured, front row, second from right) knew anything about the alleged links . Mr Henning, from Eccles, Salford, was driving an ambulance for Rochdale Aid 4 Syria, which raised money on behalf of Al-Fatiha Global, a British-based organisation which provides humanitarian aid to those caught up in warzones. He was kidnapped shortly after the convoy crossed the border from Turkey into Syria in late December last year. Earlier this year, the Charity Commission announced it had launched a probe into Al-Fatiha Global over allegations of 'inappropriate links' to militants. A statement from the regulator said it is examining the charity's accounting and alleged 'links between the charity and individuals purportedly involved in supporting armed or other inappropriate activities in Syria'. The commission said: 'The inquiry is investigating serious concerns about the governance and financial management of the charity. 'The Commission had been monitoring the charity since 2013, and the inquiry, which is the most serious level of the regulator's investigatory work, opened on 21 March 2014.' The investigation was launched after a photo emerged apparently showing Adeel Ali, the son of one of the organisation's trustees, standing in between two gunmen. Mr Henning was driving an ambulance for Rochdale Aid 4 Syria, which raised money on behalf of Al-Fatiha Global, which is now being investigated . Muslims have said they warned Mr Henning that young jihadis had 'tagged along' with some convoys . Mr Ali has insisted the photo was not of him and he has always remained in Turkey when taking part in the convoys. Mohammed Shafiq, of the moderate Ramadhan Foundation, said he warned Mr Henning of the dangers of entering Syria just weeks before his abduction. He also voiced fears that some young Britons wanting to become jihadis had ‘tagged along’ with aid convoys as a way of joining IS. He said: ‘The vast majority of people I know of who've been on the convoys are ordinary law-abiding Muslims who want to help the Syrian people. ‘Ninety-five per cent leave the aid at the Syrian border and go home, but of those who go into Syria some may have tagged along in order to join up with Isis.' Mr Henning was kidnapped half an hour after his convoy passed into Syria, raising fears ISIS was 'tipped off' Members of the convoy did not see him until he appeared in the latest beheading video with ISIS's 'Jihadi John' Trustees of Al-Fatiha Global have declined to comment on Mr Henning's kidnap, but has previously insisted the charity is a purely humanitarian organisation. In a statement made after the charity commission's investigation was launched, it stated: 'This charity is open to review and study for the management of the funds it has received and processed. 'There have been enquiries by the Charity Commission which have met with full co-operation of the trustees. 'It is apparent that there are sources who wish the Charity Commission to investigate this charity. 'The trustees will continue to act in accordance with charity law and will continue to publish their accounts.

"Victim: The man threw his 'whimpering' collie into the sea from a pier and said: 'This is how you teach your dog to swim'. Stock image . A man who had his dog seized after hurling it into the sea will be reunited with the pet after a court heard he was 'an animal lover'. Paul Sanders was said to have shouted: 'This is how you get your dog to swim' as he lobbed his terrified 10-year-old collie Shep from the pier at Babbacombe Bay, Torquay, Devon. Shocked onlookers, including horrified children, screamed as unemployed Sanders, who was only wearing swimming trucks at the time, grabbed his dog and pushed it off a stone wall, plunging 15ft into the sea. One beach goer said Torquay resident Sanders, 47, clutched the dog and chucked it over the side of the pier 'in one motion', without checking the depth of the water below. Magistrates in Torquay were told the dog was resisting being thrown over, and was heard whimpering and whining in the water as it struggled to work out which way would lead it to safety. Shep eventually made its way to safety and was later taken into the care of the RSPCA - along with Sanders’ six-year-old springer spaniel - after he was arrested by police. Sanders admitted one charge of failing to protect a dog from suffering, pain, injury and disease. Chairman of the magistrates’ bench, Anne Tully, sentenced Sanders to a six-month community order and supervision order. She said he would likely have been sent to custody had the dog been injured. She added: 'We find this whole incident has been disturbing for others. We do feel this was one rash moment. 'We do not condone whatsoever what you did by throwing a dog off the wall. 'I don’t think you need me to tell you that you will be watched incredibly closely.' Speaking outside the court, RSPCA inspector Jim Farr said he was disappointed the magistrates had not imposed a deprivation order, which would have meant the dogs would be kept from Sanders. He added: 'I am surprised. A deprivation order would have sent out a strong message to irresponsible dog owners.' Prosecuting, John Wyatt said witnesses recalled how Sanders appeared to be drunk and was shouting at his two dogs at the beauty spot, on May 25. A statement from witness Marie Walker said: 'He picked up the dog (Shep), it appeared to be resisting, scratching at the wall.' 'He then just threw the dog into the sea. It happened so fast that I screamed. I thought he was losing the plot. 'The dog was constantly howling, trying to get back.' The court was told the tide was almost completely out, meaning Shep plunged into around 12 inches of water, perilously close to the rocks. Ms Walker’s statement added: 'He (Sanders) said to me: ""This is how you get your dog to swim"". It was fighting to get down, pushing at the wall. 'I said: ""Don’t be silly"".’ 'The dog was whining and disorientated. It didn’t appear to know which way to swim.' Another witness said Sanders had told her: 'They’re my f*****g dogs, I can do what I want.' Defending, Mervyn Williams said Sanders considered the dogs his 'two best friends', and would regularly take them to the beach to play in the water. Babbacombe Bay, Devon. Sanders was allowed to keep his dogs but had to pay £500 in costs . He had been swimming for two hours on the day of the incident, but got into a conversation with one of the witnesses as he was about to leave. Mr Williams said: 'There was a conversation about how to teach a dog to swim. He (Sanders) said: ""I will show you what my dog can do"". 'Most days he will take his dog to the pier, it will run along and jump into the water. 'They (collies) are dogs which have to have a very active life,' Mr Williams added. He said: 'This was one rash moment with one of his two best friends. It is a simple, one-off incident in which he acted unwisely.' A reference read out on Sanders’ behalf described the defendant as 'a good and very dedicated dog owner'. Sanders, of Babbacombe Road in Torquay, sighed with relief after he was told he would effectively be reunited with his dogs. He was ordered to pay £500 costs.","Unemployed Paul Sanders threw his 10-year-old collie Shep into the sea .

"Most children hate having to wear braces and other orthodontic paraphernalia, striking off on a calendar the days until the dentist removes them. But not in some Southeast Asian countries, where teenagers are reportedly wearing fake train tracks glued to their teeth as a symbol of status, wealth and style - despite the fashion fad being blamed for the deaths of at least two youngsters. Since genuine braces cost around £750, wearing them is a sign of financial prosperity. But adolescents in Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia have been buying the faux oral accessories - which do not need to be fitted by a dentist - in a multitude of colours and designs, including Hello Kitty and Mickey Mouse, for as little as £62. Thai authorities blame fake braces - sold by websites including Malaysia's Braces Faces - for the deaths of two teenagers in the country . And some teenagers are even fitting them on their own, leading to serious health concerns that the tiny components - some of which are made of lead - could become loose and choke the wearer, or even cause poisoning. The aesthetic braces have been tied to the deaths . of two young people in Thailand, causing the government to tighten up restrictions around selling them. One 17-year-old girl in Thailand's northeast city of Khon Kaen was left with an infected thyroid after a bad fitting, which led to fatal heart failure. And police in Chon Buri province connected an illegal braces market stall to the death of a 14-year-old girl. Teenagers are having fake Hello Kitty and Mickey Mouse braces fitted to their teeth as a fashion statement . But although the measures were . introduced to curb the trend, the fake braces market shows no sign of . slowing down, with blogs and websites such as Malaysia's Braces Faces and Analicious selling fake metal dentistry online. Health experts have now warned young people against wearing fake fashion braces, and experts believe they are very dangerous and should be banned. The fashion braces, known as 'behel' in Indonesia, can be purchased online or from open-air street markets and fitted at beauty salons. Being caught selling fake braces in Thailand is now punishable by up to one year in jail and a £815 fine, according to CBS . Many local Asian models, actresses and musicians - including popular Indonesian singer Andika Kangen - sport colourful braces, leading young people to try and emulate them. And . photos of Western stars during their train-track-wearing days - . including Gwen Stefani - appear on blogs dedicated to fashion braces. The Thai Consumer Protection Board stated that the wires of the braces were dangerous because they contained lead - and Thai authorities have now banned the braces. Many Asian stars wear coloured braces, and young people are trying to emulate their style . Anyone found selling them could face a . six month jail sentence and a fine of up to £815; anyone found . importing the braces could face up to 12 months in jail. Rasamee Vistaveth, secretary-general of Thailand’s Consumer Protection Board, told CBS news network: 'Some people put the fashion (braces) on by themselves, which is dangerous because they could come loose and slip into the throat. 'The fake braces, which are glued onto the teeth, can also cause sores on the gums and inside the mouth and some of the wires have been found to contain lead.'","Deaths of two Thai teenagers blamed on fake orthodontic gear .

"Falllout from the massive Sony hack continues, this time with the report that 47,000 Social Security numbers have been leaked. What's more, among those individuals who had information leaked are stars including director Judd Apatow and actors Rebel Wilson and Sylvester Stallone. The leaked numbers belong to both past and current employees of the studio juggernaut. Scroll down for video . Bad news: More bad news in the Sony hack as it has been reported that 47,000 Social Security numbers for past and current employees were leaked . Celeb victims: Among those who had their information taken were Rebel Wilson, Judd Apatow (above) and Sylvester Stallone . Staying silent: The studio has no comment on this most recent leak . The studio had no comment on this most recent leak according to the Wall Street Journal. This shortly after it was revealed that financial records had became public that detailed how much stars like Seth Rogen and James Franco were making, as well as studio heads Michael Lynton and Amy Pascal. The hackers also uploaded five yet-to-be-released films to file-sharing websites, including the Brad Pitt film Fury, still in theaters, and Annie, the much-anticipated remake set for a December 19 release. The company has been trying to take the videos off the internet with cease-and-desist orders. Millionaires: Sony Pictures Entertainment Co-Chairman Amy Pascal (left) and Sony Pictures CEO Michael Lynton (right) both make $3million a year, according to the leaked documents . Pay information for more than 31,000 employees at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Ltd, a financial firm hired by Sony, were taken in the hack as well. The pay information from 2005 revealed that there are far more men than women with high-paying salaries. The list was leaked to a reporter at news and pop culture site Fusion. Kevin Roose, reporting for Fusion, who was sent a link to the data by an anonymous source, said: 'When I sorted the list by 'annual rate,' I noticed something notable: a stark homogeneity among the people earning the most. 'Based on the spreadsheet ... the employees of Sony Pictures with the highest annual rates appear to be nearly entirely white men.' Buzzfeed reviewed almost 40GB of leaked internal data and reported it included 'employee criminal background checks, salary negotiations, and doctors' letters explaining the medical rationale for leaves of absence.' It reported the files also included a script for an unreleased pilot written by Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan as well as 'email exchanges with employees regarding specific medical treatments they are undergoing, while one disciplinary letter details a manager's romantic relationship and business travel history with a subordinate.' The leaked information even includes an email about the breastfeeding diet of a senior executive. One aspect of the leak, which probably has the Sony IT team reeling, is the several spreadsheet and text documents where employees stored their passwords...under the name 'password'. The hack is thought to be carried out by those allied with the North Korean regime, unhappy with the country's portrayal in the film. In June, a North Korean official appeared on the state-run news station to say the country would pursue 'a strong and merciless countermeasure' if Sony released the film. Despite the threat, Sony has continued to roll out promotion for the movie ahead of it's December 25 release date. Exactly one month before it was set to be released, Sony confirmed that the company had been hacked, and that the mysterious group behind the cyber attack released hundreds of company documents online. The day before, an alleged warning posted to Reddit read: 'This is just the beginning'. Paydays: Seth Rogen took home $8.4million working on The Interview, compared to the $6.5million his co-star James Franco made (left), according to information revealed in the recent cyber attack on Sony . Responsible? Sources close to the internal investigation of the hack at Sony say they believe a North Korean group is behind the attack. Officials in North Korea previously threatened action . Sony has yet to officially name North Korea as the source of the cyber attack, but sources close to the internal investigation spoke out on Wednesday to say they believe a group known as DarkSeoul is to blame. The group associated with North Korea was thought to be behind the large-scale March 2013 attack on South Korean banks and broadcasters. Other evidence from the hack points to the regime, including Korean-language coding, in similarities to other attacks by DarkSeoul. The results of the internal investigation into the attack, currently being carried out by FireEye's Mandiant forensics unit, are expected to be announced later this week. Earlier this week, a North Korean spokesperson refused to deny claims that it was behind the move and would only say 'wait and see' when asked if Pyongyang was involved.","More bad news in the Sony hack as it has been reported that 47,000 Social Security numbers for past and current employees were leaked .

"The driver of an out-of-control monster truck that charged through a crowd of spectators in Mexico killing nine people has been charged with manslaughter. Francisco Velazquez, 51, who appeared before a judge in a Chihuahua state court wearing a neck brace, listened to the names of the nine victims as they were read out in court. One of the victims died in hospital during the hearing. He told the court that during the show on Saturday, he had been knocked unconscious inside the truck's cabin. Out of bounds: At the Extreme Aeroshow in Chihuahua, Mexico Saturday, a monster truck driver lost control of his vehicle and drove into a crowd of spectators . Body count: At least 8 are dead after the tragic accident. Twelve remained in intensive care Sunday . Lost control: Witnesses say they saw the driver bang his head and lose his helmet before driving into the crowd . 'I was driving to one side and then I . turned around and drove to the other side, my helmet came off and I hit . my head and lost consciousness. I wasn't conscious when the truck fell,' he said. Prosecutor Gerardo . Carbajal said: 'He didn't meet the age and health requirements needed . to be part of the show,' but he didn't say what those requirements are. Organisers of the event have said hundreds of people gathered without permission in the pit area of a makeshift arena in a park. Veteran . monster truck show organisers said spectators should never have been . standing that close to the arena floor unprotected, regardless of the . trajectory of the truck. They . said properly organised shows take place in an arena with a safety zone . separating spectators from the trucks, which the Chihuahua city show . lacked. Authorities have made no other arrests in the case. Chaos: Injured people are treated during the panic that ensued following Saturday's horrific tragedy . Aftermath: Horrified family and friends of victims search the crowd for their loved ones. On Sunday, 12 people remained in intensive care with four in critical condition . Video taken from the stands by spectator Krizthall Martinez shows the truck making an initial pass over two cars. It . then makes a second pass at higher speed, coming down sharply nose . first and bouncing violently before piling straight into the crowd, . which stood directly in the path of the monster truck unprotected by any . wall or barrier. Spectator Daniel Dominguez, 18, said he . was happily watching the show with a group of relatives when the truck . came down hard in the middle of the cars. ‘The driver hit his head and his helmet flew off,’ Dominguez said. ‘The truck came directly at where we were.’ Dominguez's 11-year-old sister was taken into surgery for injuries to her legs, and his mother was also treated for minor contusions. The governor of the Mexican state declared three days of mourning to honour victims. The three-day show, which included performances by airplanes, the monster truck acts and other events, was cancelled after the accident on its second day in a park on the outskirts of Chihuahua, the capital of Chihuahua state.. Path of destruction: Initially, the mayor of Chihuahua announced that 47 people had been injured in the accident, but that number has now grown to more than 70 . Locked in: Authorities are also investigating whether a mechanical error might have happened with the truck, causing the gas pedal to remain engaged . On Sunday, two armed men threw a . firebomb at monster trucks and other vehicles parked at a hotel that . were part of an unrelated monster truck production at the air show. Chihuahua . Gov. Cesar Duarte Juarez said his administration, which was listed as a . sponsor of the air show, was investigating whether Civil Protection . authorities had correctly enforced safety regulations. He and other officials didn't say if those regulations required any protective barrier for spectators. Some . witnesses said the driver appeared to have hit his head on the interior . of the truck, which is nicknamed ‘Big Show,’ as he drove over the old . cars. At least two reported seeing the driver's helmet come off before . the huge vehicle drove into the crowd of terrified spectators, who tried . to flee. ‘I fell over, and . when I turned around I saw the tire very close. It hit me and threw me . to the other side,’ Jesus Manuel Ibarra, 41, said as he was treated for . injuries to his arm and hip. Six people were killed at the scene of . the truck show Saturday, and another three people died receiving medical . attention. Four bodies were found under the monster truck's . wheels. Chihuahua Mayor . Marco Quezada said 79 people had been hurt. Twelve remained in intensive . care, with four in critical condition, he said. In custody: The monster truck driver survived the crash and was arrested Sunday on suspicions of manslaughter. Tests indicated he may have been drinking . Over: The airshow was cancelled after the accident . Medical attention: An injured spectator being airlifted out of the monster truck show yesterday . Gonzalez, . the prosecutor's spokesman, said investigators were looking into the . possibility of a mechanical failure that left Velazquez unable to . release the gas pedal. Several . witnesses said, however, that the driver appeared to have become . incapacitated after striking his head as he bounced over small cars at . high speed, crushing their roofs.","Francisco Velazquez, 51, told a Chihuahua court that he had been knocked unconscious inside the cabin when the truck fell on spectators, killing nine .

"Swansea's Ki Sung-yueng revealed his first Liberty Stadium goal against QPR was even more special as his actress wife was in the crowd. The South Korean midfielder joined Swansea for a then club record £5.5million fee in August 2012 but was sent out on loan to Sunderland last season where he was influential in helping the Black Cats win their battle for top-flight survival. Ki returned to south Wales last summer and the former Celtic playmaker has repaid manager Garry Monk's faith in him by playing in every Barclays Premier League game as Swansea have climbed into the top six. Ki Sung-yueng made a heart sign after scoring against QPR and dedicated the goal to his wife in the crowd . Rob Green could only watch as Ki's angled shot nestled into the bottom corner of the net . The 25-year-old scored his first Swansea goal in a 2-1 win at Manchester United on the opening day of the season but he had to wait until Tuesday's 2-0 victory over QPR to register in front of Liberty Stadium fans who included his wife Han Hye-jin. Ki celebrated his goal by making a heart sign with his hands, and said: 'It was for my wife who was in the crowd. 'She comes to every game so she's been waiting a while. Normally I'm not a player who scores - it happens once every three months - but it was nice to score in front of her.' Ki was on the scoresheet for the first time since the win at Manchester United back in August . Monk said after Swansea's victory that he had told Ki 'it was about time he scored' - and his late effort was perfectly timed as it finally broke QPR's resistance before Wayne Routledge added gloss with a second against his former club. But Ki said there was no extra pressure on him to score, even if the return of midfield anchorman Leon Britton after long-term injury allowed him to play in a more advanced role. 'He (Monk) doesn't want to put us under pressure to score, he just gives us more encouragement and is patient with us,' Ki said. 'We have great attacking players in front of me who are always making great chances, so we are not worried about scoring. Swansea City boss Garry Monk said 'it was about time' Ki was back among the goals . 'It happens sometimes in games that you can't, but I've tried to improve myself and I wanted to score more. 'Normally I stay at the back but I got the chance to push on and my first goal in front of the home fans was very meaningful.' Swansea travel to West Ham next on Sunday with Sam Allardyce's side two points better off than the Welsh club after their 2-1 win at West Brom, and Ki said he is expecting a tough physical examination in east London. Ki says the Swans must stand up and be counted when they travel to West Ham on Sunday . 'It's not always easy away from home, especially at West Ham,' Ki said. 'We have to be physically ready. 'I'm sure we will have chances so we know we have to concentrate on our defensive work and give us possibility to win. 'I am not sure if we are better than when I first came here but we are getting better results. 'We are sixth after this amount of games for the first time and all the boys are mentally prepared to achieve. It is different.'","Ki opened the scoring in Tuesday night's 2-0 victory against the R's .

"A 911 call made by a horrified restaurant worker after finding her co-worker dead in a dumbwaiter reveals the terrible extent of the 21-year-old victim's injuries. The unnamed employee of Fountain City's WingDam Saloon and Grill in Winona, Minnesota, had evidently opened the elevator used to shuttle drinks between floors to find a Brooke Baures in an unspeakable state. 'I think one of my co-workers got (caught) in, like, our dumbwaiter,' the co-worker told a 911 operator just before 8m Monday. 'But I'm not willing to look close enough.' The woman asked another employee to look at the apparently contorted remains. 'It's her. We need someone here like ASAP,' she told the operator in a recording obtained by the Winona Daily News. Police so far have found no witnesses to help them in the investigation of the death of Brooke Baures who was found in a dumbwaiter where she worked . As students of Winona State University mourned, and held a candlelit vigil for their friend, local authorities began trying to peace together what killed the beloved college gymnast. After days, they still couldn't find anyone among two dozen witnesses who'd seen her get into the 3x3 machine, though they remained confident no crime had been committed. '[She] was found trapped inside the entirety of the device,' Fountain City Police Chief Jason Mork revealed. 'To explain more of her specific location, orientation or obvious injuries would require an extremely graphic explanation.' Mork said Wednesday he has interviewed about half of the customers and employees present at the WingDam Saloon and Grill Monday night, and that, so far, no one saw how the student entered the dumbwaiter. Mork said he has talked face-to-face with about 14 of the 28 potential witnesses and said there was no indication how or why Baures entered the food elevator. It was not something employees had done in the past, he said. Baures was found at the bottom of a dumb waiter on Monday at the bar and grill where she worked in Wisconsin. The 21-year-old was found dead at The WingDam Saloon & Grill in Fountain City at 8pm on Monday . Horrifying: The device is used to shuttle drinks and food between floors and authorities said Wednesday that Baures was 'found trapped inside the entirety of the device' (FILE) Last night her teammates from Winona State University led the tributes to the talented gymnast, saying 'she was literally everything to the team.' Brooke Hiestand, a member of Winona State Warriors, said: 'She was the person that held us together, and if you had something that you didn't know what to do...for some reason, she always knew the answer...always.' Police investigating the death said they haven't found a single witness to explain how the gymnast ended up dead in a food elevator. Fountain City Police Officer Jason Mork said he had interviewed half of the customers and employees at the WingDam Saloon and Grill in Wisconsin on Monday night.

Her teammates from the Winona State Warriors led the tributes to the talented gymnast . Head gymnastics coach Beckie Rolbiecki asked friends, family, and classmates to raise their candles . Autopsy results are still pending, but officers have not found any indication that her death was caused by foul play. Chief Mork said the dumbwaiter's opening is about 3ft by 3ft and the service elevator connects the first and second floors. Police said she was trapped in the small elevator when they arrived. Miss Baures, an accomplished athlete, was twice named the Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference gymnast of the week this year and documented her athletics career enthusiastically on social media. She was described by friends and family as a 'strong, determined, and beautiful young woman' at the candlelit vigil held on the University campus.

"The body of a Territorial Army soldier was found 30ft up a tree after his was patrol lured towards a hidden bomb, an inquest heard. Private Matthew Thornton, 28, was five weeks into a tour of duty in Helmand when he was killed by the huge blast. A factory worker from Barnsley in civilian life, Pte Thornton was described as 'a cracking soldier who gave 100 per cent' by his Captain Stephen Dando. Lured to his death: Private Matthew Thornton was with the First Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment when his patrol came under fire from the Taliban . Soldiers told an inquest in Sheffield how he had been patrolling with colleagues from First Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment north of . Checkpoint Loy Mandeh, in Lashkar Gah when they came under attack on November 9 last year. They took cover behind a wall as Taliban insurgents threw grenades and fired small arms. But there was a huge explosion after Pte Thornton stepped on a pressure plate-activated . improvised explosive device that was hidden in the undergrowth. His body was later found around 30ft up in a tree. Major Stephen Sutherland, a bomb . disposal expert called to the scene in the aftermath, said: 'The . improvised explosive device had been placed in undergrowth beneath the . wall and it could be the grenade rounds were thrown to push the soldiers . into the area. 'The Taliban are very intuitive and . tactically-astute. In the past, devices were two or three kilogrammes . and we saw a lot of amputations. This was of more significant size. Insurgents are laying large devices to ensure they kill.' Tribute: Private Matthew Thornton's coffin is carried from All Saints Church in Darton, south Yorkshire after his funeral last year .

"These may look like old masterpieces but with an iPad featuring in one, it becomes clear they are new modern takes on classic artworks. Photographer Derek Galon has painstakingly recreated some of history's most famous works using real-life models and giving them a modern twist. He crafted the scenes by selecting props, costumes and even suitable models to look like the original work. The photographer, from Victoria in Canada calls the body of works 'Painterly' and features scenes ranging from raucous taverns to gruesome dentists. Mr Galon said: 'When I studied fine arts, I was fascinated by old masters such as Rembrandt, Caravaggio, Titian, Brouwer. 'I went back to fascinations of my younger years, creating a series of images in a painterly style. These are not copies of old masterpieces, but an homage to their timeless excellence.

"Anthony Joshua is convinced he is ready to beat both Tyson Fury and Dereck Chisora, and has former world champion David Haye in his sights, too. Joshua, whose next test is against American Kevin Johnson on January 31, insisted he wants a significant step up. And after watching Fury dominate Chisora last weekend, he echoed his promoter Eddie Hearn’s calls for a high-profile domestic dust-up next year. Scroll down to watch Anthony Joshua square off with Kevin Johnson . Anthony Joshua (right) squares up to Kevin Johnson ahead of their heavyweight clash on January 31 . Joshua will face the toughest test of his career against Johnson when they meet at the O2 in the new year . ‘I went to see Fury beat Chisora but there wasn’t much to see,’ Joshua said. ‘You can’t write off either but from an entertainment point it was poor. ‘But it’s done me good because the guys who went will say, “who’s next on the agenda?”. ‘I’m confident in my own ability that I could cause an upset and beat those guys. ‘But if I was to line them all up, David Haye is the one I would like to fight. He’s the best and when you fight the best it brings the best out in you. I need to step up, which is what we’re doing. I think we’re going to take some risky fights and I’m sure I’ll overcome them.’ Before that, however, Joshua must navigate a way past Johnson, who has never been stopped in his 36-fight career. He unsuccessfully challenged Vitali Klitschko for the world title in 2009 and has taken both Chisora and Fury the 12-round distance. Johnson took Vitali Klitschko the distance in their world title fight in 2009 and have never been stopped . But Joshua said: ‘Just because he’s never been stopped does not mean he’s a winner, it just means he goes in to survive. It should be a tough sparring session. If I can stop him, I’ve ticked a box and I move on. I’m confident I can. ‘I’ll train over Christmas; if I want to beat him I have to make the sacrifice. I don’t think he’ll train over Christmas or New Year. If I get the stoppage it’ll be because I’ve done the extra bits, if I don’t you know I’ll have been out raving!’ On a visit to London on Wednesday, Johnson challenged his younger opponent to a wager. He said: ‘I want to make an agreement. If Anthony knocks me out I’ll donate 50 per cent of my purse to one of his charities. And if he gets knocked out, he gives 50 per cent to my charity. Joshua is confident he would beat both Tyson Fury (left) and Dereck Chisora next year . Joshua also wants to fight David Haye (right) who has been out of action since beating Chisora in 2012 . ‘There’s going to be a knockout so let’s up the ante.’ But Joshua said: ‘I do my charity work but I’ve got a professional job to do. I’ve seen boxers throw cash about but I want to leave that to one side.’ Before he returns to his gym in London, however, Joshua will spend 10 days in Cuba. He said: ‘I’m taking my gumshield to see if I can get some sparring. What an experience that would be. ‘I’ll start ticking over for this fight, get some sun on my back and some runs on the beach. Then I’ll come back feeling refreshed.’","Anthony Joshua takes on Kevin Johnson at the O2 on January 31 .

"Millwall's perfect start to the season continued thanks to a 1-0 victory secured by Martyn Woolford's 12th-minute tap-in, but Fulham will be wondering how they are still pointless after two games of the new season. They dominated this London derby for long periods, especially after £11m summer signing Ross McCormack came on as a substitute at half-time. But they could not find a way past a stubborn Millwall defence, in which captain Alan Dunne and goalkeeper David Forde were outstanding. Fulham manager Felix Magath had initially put McCormack on the bench after claiming that the former Leeds striker was not fully fit. Hugo Rodallega returned, one of four changes following the 2-1 opening-day defeat away to Ipswich. Tussle: Fulham's Lasse Vigen Christensen and Millwall's Scott McDonald battle for the ball . Millwall were unchanged from their victory over Leeds and settled better early on but it was Fulham who got in the first shot of the match, George Williams firing wide after capitalising on the visitors' failure to clear. . Williams also had a shot blocked by Millwall captain Alan Dunne after good work by Emerson Hyndman but it was the Lions who took the lead in the 12th minute. There seemed little danger as Ricardo Fuller crossed from the left, but Fulham captain Scott Parker's attempt to head clear only flicked the ball away from his stranded goalkeeper, Jesse Joronen, and into the path of Woolford, who scored with ease. Poor start: Fulham have lost both of their opening Championship games, although could have won either . Bulgarian defender Nikolay Bodurov headed wide from Konstantinos Stafylidis' corner as Fulham looked for a reply. The energetic young home side often had Millwall at full stretch as they played short passes at speed but defenders produced a series of blocks to deny the hosts. And left back Scott Malone, forward in support of a quick break, almost scored a second goal for Millwall with a dipping volley after 36 minutes that Joronen did well to palm over the crossbar. Two minutes later Forde did just as well to flick away a header by Fulham's Cameron Burgess that was looping in. And he was relieved when Parker's shot from 25 yards sailed over his head but also over the bar. Tackle: Scott Parker puts in a crunching tackle on Millwall's Shaun Williams . Magath sent on McCormack after the interval and he almost created the equaliser in the 47th minute, his pass giving Hugo Rodallega the chance to send Forde sprawling to save a low shot. But Joronen had to rescue his team again in the 57th minute, blocking Malone's shot with his right foot after Scott McDonald had created the opening. Just before the hour, Parker slipped a pass to McCormack that seemed to have provided his first goal for Fulham. But Forde was equal to the shot although Fulham, galvanised by McCormack, were getting closer. Rodallega's shot on the turn beat Forde but Dunne cleared the ball from the goalline. And then Forde blocked again from McCormack after he had bustled past Mark Beevers.","Fulham and Millwall met at Craven Cottage in the Championship .

"A Connecticut high school English teacher has pleaded guilty to felony charges related to a sexual relationship she carried on with an underage student. Danielle Watkins accepted a plea agreement on Thursday that will lead to a jail term of up to four years. The 32-year-old Watkins entered her pleas to felony charges of second-degree sexual assault and risk of injury to a minor. Danielle Watkins accepted a plea agreement on Thursday that will lead to a jail term of up to four years and save her from a possible 20. She admitted to having a months-long sexual relationship with a 17-year-old student . The agreement calls for her to be placed on the state's Sex Offender Registry for 10 years. She's set to return to Stamford Superior Court for sentencing Jan. 22. The plea agreement calls for her to serve between nine months and four years in jail. Two school administrators were charged with failing to report the relationship and received probation. Watkins, who is married with two young children, also sent the teen nude pictures during their eight-month relationship and supplied him and a friend with marijuana, cops said. Watkins turned herself into authorities in Stamford in July. Watkins, a teacher for nine years, also allegedly bought marijuana for him and a 15-year-old friend - whom she also taught - and let him drive her car while knowing he did not have a license. Her two students smoked the drug during school hours, sometimes on school grounds, the older boy told police. On June 26, three days after telling the counselor about the affair, he went to Stamford Police to make a statement about the relationship. The 15-year-old boy also gave a statement to police. Watkins has two young children. She accepted a plea agreement on Thursday that will lead to a jail term of up to four years.The 32-year-old Watkins entered her pleas to felony charges of second-degree sexual assault and risk of injury to a minor . On June 27, police officers pulled over Watkins' car and inside they found marijuana and a cell phone, which contained evidence she had sent naked photos of herself to the boy. Lt. Diedrich Hohn, in charge of the case, told MailOnline that she was 'hostile' and 'verbally combative' during the search. As cops pulled her over, she had tried to hide her cellphone under the passenger seat, he said. Watkins allegedly exchanged more than 2,000 text messages and hundreds of phone calls with the teenager. Superintendent Winifred Hamilton said Watkins has been placed on administrative leave until the investigation is complete. 'We are aware of the allegations,' Hamilton said. 'We take these issues very seriously and always act to protect the welfare of our students.' Address records show Watkins, lives with a man, Jermaine, whom she is believed to be married to. Facebook images suggest they have two children together. She was also arrested earlier this year in her home town of Norwalk after prescription pills were found in her car after a minor accident. Neighbors say the married mother-of-two then went into rehab. The underage student waited until after school let out for the year last year to tell authorities about the relationship because, he said, Watkins had threatened to fail him if he broke things off .","Connecticut teacher and mother of two Danielle Watkins had an eight-month affair with one of her students and sent him nude pictures of herself .

"A Fox News panelist caused his co-hosts to squirm today as he implied that sexual assault was to blame for why San Francisco's nudists prefer to live their lives in the buff. During today's live broadcast of The Five, Bob Beckel was seated with the usual hosts as they weighed the issue of the proposed nudity ban in San Francisco. Dana Perino sparked a debate when she inquired of her cohorts: 'What happened to these people as children that they don’t want to wear any clothes?' Scroll down for video . Shock claim: Bob Beckel suggested that sexual assault was to blame when asked why anyone would like to strut around San Francisco without clothes on . Reaction: Co-host Dana Perino, right, looked as if she couldn't believe what she was hearing as Beckel spoke during the live show . Naked passion: Protester Gypsy Taub speaks out against the Board of Supervisors decision to ban public nakedness . Andrea Tantaros suggested that those pushing back against the nudity ban are 'desperate for attention.' But Beckel's opinion on the matter was a tad more extreme: 'Most of them were gang banged probably. While his stunned co-hosts cringed, Beckel added: 'I don’t know - they could have had sexual assault on them.' Nude protest: A naked demonstrator sits on the steps of City Hall in San Francisco as the ban was voted on by the council . Equally stunned were viewers who took to Twitter to voice their outrage over Beckel's comments. One user tweeted: 'I wonder if [Perino] is proud to sit & made to shut up next to the misogynist men on [Fox News]. This is disgusting.' Another suggested that Beckel has 'evolved from the village idiot.' One more suggested that Beckel's remark earns him the distinction of the 'Joe Biden of Fox News.' Hours after Beckel's outburst, San Francisco lawmakers narrowly approved a proposal to ban public nakedness, rejecting arguments that the measure would eat away at a reputation for tolerance enjoyed by a city known for flouting convention and flaunting its counter-culture image. The 6-5 Board of Supervisors vote . means that exposed genitals will be prohibited in most public places, . including streets, sidewalks and public transit. Supervisor .

Opposition: Taylor Whitfield holds up a sign protesting the Board of Supervisors' ban on public nudity . A man undresses at Civic Center Plaza in San Francisco, California October 30 . 'The Castro and San Francisco in general, is a place of freedom, expression and acceptance. But freedom, expression and acceptance does not mean anything goes under any circumstances,' Wiener said on Tuesday. 'Our public spaces are for everyone and as a result it's appropriate to have some minimal standards of behavior.' Weiner's opponents on the board said a citywide ban would draw police officers' attention away from more critical problems and eat away at city's reputation for tolerance. A nude man carries a sign at Civic Center Plaza in San Francisco, California October 30 . Covered up: An officer rushes to put clothing on Gypsy Taub after the ban was narrowly approved . 'I'm concerned about civil liberties, about free speech, about changing San Francisco's style and how we are as a city,' Supervisor John Avalos said. Under Weiner's proposal, a first offense would carry a maximum penalty of a $100 fine, but prosecutors would have authority to charge a third violation as a misdemeanor punishable by up to a $500 fine and a year in jail. Exemptions would be made for participants at permitted street fairs and parades, such as the city's annual gay pride event and the Folsom Street Fair, which celebrates sadomasochism and other sexual subcultures. A federal lawsuit claiming the ban would violate the free speech rights of people who prefer to make a statement by going au naturel was filed last week in case the ordinance passes.

"Denial: Andrew Hamade, brother of Bryan 26 (pictured), has denied accusations that his brother leaked nude celebrity pictures online . An American software engineer has denied stealing nude photos from celebrities’ iCloud accounts and claimed his life was being ruined after being identified as the hacker online. Bryan Hamade, 26, was named as the source of the shocking leak after he tried to sell intimate pictures of actress Jennifer Lawrence in return for internet currency Bitcoin. She and 100 other celebrities have been named on a list of victims after their accounts on Apple’s file sharing service were allegedly hacked into. Mr Hamade posted some of the pictures on social networking website Reddit under the username BluntMastermind and allegedly tried to sell them for $100 each. But he was forced to deny he was the original hacker after internet users on file sharing website 4chan – where the original pictures appeared - identified his real name. Admitting he had been an ‘idiot’, he insisted he had lied about being the original hacker and said the photo he had tried to sell was a fake. He told the MailOnline: ‘I am not behind this. I lied to someone on reddit to try and get bitcoins with a photoshopped picture. ' Outside her home near to Atlanta, Georgia, Jenna Bennett, Hamade's mother, told MailOnline that her son was not there. She said that Hamade is trying to hire a lawyer but has had trouble as it is Labor Day. She said the family may make a statement later. According to a graphic chart doing the rounds online, Hamade, who posts online under the username, BluntMastermind, gave himself away as one of the original leakers when he attempted to prove to a 4chan user he had genuine nude images for sale. Andrew said that the family have not been contacted by the FBI, but said they were being harassed by news crews who were keen to speak to them . Exercise: Jenna Bennet, who is Bryan Hamade's mother leaves the house she shares with her son on Monday amid the growing controversy surrounding the software developer . Explanation: This graph created by a reddit user explains why suspicion has fallen on the shoulders of Bryan Hamade . He posted a screen grab of his computer which revealed his hard drive and network drive. Reddit users tracked back through Hamade's previous posts and matched the hard drive and the PC name - thereby allegedly outing him as one of the original leakers. However, he vehemently denied this to the MailOnline. ‘4chan thinks it's me for because of the photoshopped post I made. I am not a hacker. I have no idea how the hell someone could hack into all those accounts.’ Mr Hamade said he had been wrongly identified as the hacker after other internet users launched a ‘witch hunt’ to find the culprit. According to one amateur internet sleuth, he had claimed to own 13 pictures of Miss Lawrence, 24, including four nude photos. He allegedly asked for $100 for each photo but was identified after he posted a screenshot of his computer desktop that showed his ‘network folders’ saved in his name. Mr Hamade added: 'I am just an idiot . who tried to pull one over on 4chan and lost big time. I am not the . original leaker. I only reposted one thing that was posted elsewhere and . stupidly had my network folders visible. Watch Video Here . Mr Hamade tried to sell intimate pictures of actress Jennifer Lawrence (left) in return for the internet currency Bitcoin. Kate Upton (right) was among the list of victims whose accounts on iCloud were allegedly hacked into . The original photos were reportedly stolen via iCloud, before being published on file-sharing website 4chan . 'I'd never in a million years know how to hack into any of the accounts listed. 4chan just attacked me because they like to attack anyone in situations such as this.’ Mr Hamade works for software company Southern Digital Media in Lawrenceville, Georgia. Hamade has taken down all his social media and said that his original plan to profit off the leakers has backfired. And in a further damning twist, a search of the Google cache for Hamade's deleted Twitter feed shows that he sent Olympic gymnast, McKayla Maroney, who was hacked, a message in April of this year. In it he comments on one of her gymnastic performances, saying, 'That's some serious arm dancing.' Why? Reddit users asked Hamade why he interacted with 18-year-old Olympic gymnast McKayla Maroney. He said it was an innocent exchange . Indeed, according to his own employers' website, Hamade is qualified in code and a specialist in PHP, MySql, HTML and Java. In another screenshot from the anon-ib message board, where the nude pictures were allegedly collected before being posted onto 4chan, there is a posting from a user known as 'OriginalGuy'. Reddit user claim that OriginalGuy was posting pictures that had appeared only on postings made by Hamade. According to the company’s website, he is a recent graduate of the University of Georgia and is the company’s ‘technical expert’, specializing in several computer programming codes. Hamade says he is now seeking a lawyer to defend himself against any charges that may be brought against him. He also says he is looking for the true leaker. 'The real guy is on 4chan posting intermittently,' Hamade said of the nude photo leaker. 'He’s most likely the one behind it, but it does seem the photos passed around to multiple people before being leaked, so it may just be someone who has them and didn’t hack to get them.' Time-stamp: This post to reddit reveals an argument between Bryan Hamade and another user about the time the Atlanta technician posted pictures to the web-thread service . Cat Deeley (right) was named as a victim whose photographs were stolen, but no supposedly 'nude' images of her have appeared online, while Nickelodeon star Victoria Justice (left) wrote on Twitter her image was . faked . A spokesman for Oscar winner Miss Lawrence has confirmed the photos of her are genuine, saying: 'This is a flagrant violation of privacy. The authorities have been contacted and will prosecute anyone who posts the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.’ Other celebrities named in the list posted by the hacker include Kate Upton, Cat Deeley, Ariana Grande and Victoria Justice. Some in the list have denied the photos are genuine. In other cases, photos have not yet been leaked online.","Bryan Hamade, 26, was named as source of leak of nude celebrity photos .

"A shocking 84 percent of vegetarians eventually return to eating meat, according to a new study. The Humane Research Council conducted the survey of over 11,000 adults with varied diets and found that not only did most vegetarians go back to eating meat, only two per cent of Americans are vegetarians. The study also found that 88 per cent have never tried vegetarianism or veganism. Out of the 12 percent of Americans who have chosen carrots over cow, five out of six people return to being carnivores. Not just vegetables: A shocking 84 per cent of vegetarians have returned to eating meat, according to a new research study by the Humane Research Council . Their stories of how they went back to their meat eating lifestyle vary from accidental tastings to cataclysmic cravings. Some say their diet was no match to the taste of fried chicken. 'I was a vegetarian until this one time I drank whiskey and ate a piece of bacon at 4 a.m.,' Chelsea Qualls, 24, told The New York Daily News. Prior to this meatful night she was a vegetarian for four years. 'I took a bite of my friend's pizza, which happened to have bacon, and then the next morning we went to brunch, and I ordered more bacon because it was delicious,' said Qualls. Qualls ate nothing but noodles, rice, and vegetables during her stint as a vegetarian and she missed the dining rituals associated with meat. 'I missed out on FOUR delicious Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners!' she said. 'It was a sad time.' Interestingly enough the study shows that half of vegetarians who went back to eating meat did it for their partners. 'I did it for love,' Harlem actor and comedian Andrew Kimmer, 31, told The New York Daily News. He says that when his wife had to eat meat for medical reasons he started eating meat again. 'It’s always the woman’s fault,' he joked. Kimmer said his love of Italian cuisine also pushed Kimmer back to eating antipasti. While vegetarians go back to eating meat they don't always eat all types of meat. While 'everything' tastes like chicken, vegetables don't and former vegetarians can’t stop putting poultry in their mouths. 'Chicken is the most common type of meat consumed by former vegetarians/vegans, ‘the study group reported. Feed me now: Nutritionist Lisa Young told The New York Daily News that cravings are the number one thing making vegetarians and vegans meat eaters again and mostly because they quit meat cold turkey . 'Reducing and eliminating chicken consumption will have the greatest impact on the number of farmed animals’ lives saved.' Katie Busch, 27, told The New York Daily news that she craved the meat in a McDonald’s Happy Meal. She became a vegetarian at age 10 and went back to meat at 25. 'I really missed Chicken fingers, probably because I went vegetarian at age 10, so I’d never had most ‘adult’ meats,' says Busch. 'I went back because meat was delicious ... and at that point I realized I’m going to hell for other reasons — may as well give up the ghost and embrace the dark side.' Nutritionist Lisa Young told The New York Daily News that cravings are the number one thing making vegetarians and vegans meat eaters again and mostly because they quit meat cold turkey. 'They say, ""I’m never going to eat that again,""' says Young, cautioning against the all-or-nothing approach. 'If you start by eating smaller portions of pork or chicken, then cutting out all meat and dairy for a month, you can get a better feel for it,' says Young. When Kathleen Curtis, 23, watched a PETA video she stopped eating meat for moral reasons but the cravings became too strong. She indulged in a bacon-filled hamburger on Friday and hasn’t gone back since. 'It was the best decision I've ever made,' adds Curtis. Those animal rights groups whose salad is tossed out of place upon hearing the news might be comforted by the fact that 37 per cent of ex-vegetarians want to stop eating meat in the future.","Humane Research Council conducted the survey of over 11,000 adults with varied diets and found 84 per cent of vegetarians go back to eating meat .

"Gareth Barry says he has not given up hope of an England recall and believes Jack Wilshere has a lot to learn if he is to become the Three Lions' answer in defensive midfield. Barry hasn't featured for his country since playing in a friendly against Norway in May 2012, with boss Roy Hodgson opting to name instead the likes of Wilshere, Jordan Henderson and Fabian Delph as he plans for the future. Hodgson's chosen 4-4-2 diamond formation for their Euro 2016 qualifiers has seen Wilshere picked at the base of midfield - a position that doesn't appear natural to the Arsenal star. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Everton midfielder Gareth Barry says he has not given up hope of playing for England again in the future . Barry's last international cap was in May 2012 when England took on Norway in a friendly in Oslo . Caps: 53 . Goals: Three . Senior debut: 31/05/00 vs Ukraine . Last match: 26/05/12 vs Norway . International tournaments: Euro 2000 (didn't play), 2010 World Cup . With Steven Gerrard's retirement from international football after the World Cup, and with Michael Carrick out injured, there is a currently a lack of natural English talent in this position. Barry, who has 53 caps for his country, has been performing this role diligently for Everton and the 33-year-old believes his experience in this position can be an added bonus to the national team and Wilshere in particular. 'We do not have lots of holding midfielders. I'm not sure what the situation is with Michael Carrick, but Steven Gerrard is retired, so there is a place for someone,' he told the Daily Telegraph. 'If Jack [Wilshere] is going to do it, there is a lot to learn, but he had a very good game last week, although I am sure he will admit himself he has a lot to learn. Steven Gerrard retired from international duty after the World Cup in Brazil, leaving a hole in England's midfield . Barry said Jack Wilshere still has a lot to learn if he wants to be England's new defensive midfielder . 'It is a disciplined role, where it is as much what you do off the ball as on it. The link play is the biggest thing but being in the right place to stop counter attacks is also vital.' he added. Barry, who penned a three-year deal at Everton in July following an exceptional loan spell at Goodison Park last term, also revealed he turned down offers from three or four Premier League teams as well as a lucrative offer to join new MLS franchise New York City. The former Aston Villa and Manchester City man has endured an inconsistent start to the season since joining the Toffees permanently with the club lying 17th in the Premier League and two points above the drop zone.

"Lionel Messi is to face a court trial for alleged tax evasion after a judge rejected the Barcelona star's appeal in Spain. The  four-time Ballon d'Or winner and his father, Jorge Messi, are accused of withholding about £3.4million in unpaid taxes between 2007 and 2009.

In July, Spain's public prosecutor recommended charges be dismissed against the 27-year-old, arguing Messi was not responsible for his family's finances, as that was his father's duty. If a court decides that he was party to the wilful avoidance of tax he will face a large fine and could even face a suspended prison sentence. Messi made a payment of about £8m to the Spanish tax man last year to head off further problems relating to years tax 2010 and 2011, and paid the £10.2m owed on his image rights and the £9.4m owed on his salary on time for the last tax year.

"For most of us, it would be flattering to be told we look years younger than our age. But one 50-year-old found the compliment rapidly losing its appeal – as a supermarket told him he looked far too fresh-faced to be served alcohol.

Mr Brown, whose oldest child is 30, thought the cashier was joking but when he told her his age she still was not convinced . Mr Brown, from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, said people normally guess he is 15 years younger than his real age. He . said: 'My dad didn’t look his age and my mum died relatively young and . out of my six siblings I am the oldest, but I’ve been told I look the . youngest. 'Once I went out and somebody asked my daughter if I was her boyfriend and she said ""Don’t be silly - it’s my dad"". 'I’ve been on holiday with my wife and other people have thought I was my wife’s toyboy.' A Morrison’s spokesman said: 'We are required by law to police the sale of alcohol and take our responsibility very seriously. 'As part of this, we have adopted Challenge 25, a policy of asking for identification from anyone who doesn’t look over the age of 25. 'We hope Mr Brown took the request as a compliment as he must look very young for his age.' While it is legal in the UK for anyone over 18 to purchase alcohol many retailers follow the Challenge 25 protocol. Challenge 25 encourages anyone who is over 18 but looks under 25 to carry acceptable ID when they want to buy alcohol. Mr Brown has three children - Natasha, 30, Ethan, 28, and Evont’e, 17.

"This is the spectacular result of China's coldest winter in decades. Fast-flowing water would normally be raging down the rocky cliffs of the 200ft fall in Anjiazhuang Valley, a suburb of Beijing. But with temperatures plummeting to their lowest in 28 years - it has frozen over - giving these climbing tourists a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to scale its heights. Slippery slope: Brave climbing enthusiasts take on the spectacular frozen waterfall in Beijing, China . One off: The 200ft drop is normally a fast-flowing waterfall but it has frozen over in an unusually cold winter . Parts of northeastern China have seen temperatures of -40 degrees this year. The extreme weather has seen an estimated 180,000 cattle killed, airports closed and electricity supplies cut off. Ice climbing is a popular sport around the world but can be much more dangerous than rock climbing - especially if the ice is melting.

"Classic paintings have been brought to life by an animator who has created a film of moving artworks. Italian Rino Stefano Tagliafierro took around 100 images and brought them to life using the 2.5D effect. Sometimes the images move subtly with the addition of water moving across Emerald Bay in Thomas Hill's painting of Lake Tahoe or more dramatically in the blinking child of William Adolphe Bouguereau's The Difficult Lesson. Scroll down for video and GIFs . The Execution of Lady Jane Grey, an oil painting by Paul Delaroche that hangs in the National Gallery in London, has also been brought to life in the Italian artist's nine-minute animated paintings video called Beauty . A decapitated head is raised in Caravaggio's Davide con la testa di Golia . William Adolphe Bouguereaus 'The Nut Gatherers' is altered so that some of the nuts slip between the girl's fingers . The 34-year-old experimental animator and director behind the clip lives and works in Milan. He used the 2.5D effect, also known as the 'animated photo effect', which can be created in software such as After Effects or Final Cut. Called Beauty, the series of images set to music move from landscapes, to portraits as well as more gruesome battle and execution scenes. One of the more graphic pieces animates Judith Beheading Holofernes by Caravaggio which was painted in 1598-99. The birds in Ivan Shishkin's Forest Edge can just be seen almost hidden behind the trees . Gabriel von Max --The Ecstatic Virgin Anna Katharina Emmerich . The animations sometimes move subtly but enough to make the images feel more alive, especially here in William Adolphe Bouguereau's L'Innocence . Writing on his website, Mr Tagliafierro says: 'These images which the history of art has consigned to us as frozen movement can today come back to life thanks to the fire of digital invention.' The artist studied at ISIA - Higer Institutes for Industrial Arts in Urbino and at IED - European Institute of Design in Milan. Included in the nine-minute clip are Caravaggio's Binding of Isaac and The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp by Rembrandt as well as several artworks spanning several different periods. The Execution of Lady Jane Grey, an oil painting by Paul Delaroche that hangs in the National Gallery in London, has also been brought to life. Mr Tagliafierro has been internationally rewarded for his work including accolades at the Video Art & Experimental Film Festival New York and the Atlanta Film Festival 2013.","Italian Rino Stefano Tagliafierro used around 100 images .

"A British millionaire accused of sexually assaulting a woman on Bondi Beach told her that a prosecution against him would ‘go nowhere’ because he was rich, a court heard yesterday. Gregory Charles Cox, who founded his own financial services firm, is accused of having sex with a 21-year-old tourist without consent. The 32-year-old was said to have held the ‘terrified’ woman her on her knees so she could perform a sex act on him after they met at a bar on the Sydney beach. Accused: British multi-millionaire entrepreneur Gregory Cox at the Downing Centre District Court in Sydney, Australia, accused of sexually assaulting a 21-year-old woman . She later claimed Cox had said: ‘You . can tell the police, you can tell whoever you like but this will never . go anywhere – I’ve got a lot of money.’ In his opening address to the jury, . prosecutor Huw Baker said Cox met the holidaymaker, from Bermuda, at a . beach-side bar but she had initially been interested in his friend. Although heavy drinking had given her . a ‘patchy memory’, she left the bar with the tycoon and headed along . the beach, said Mr Baker. ‘She recalls being on her knees and . she tried to stand up but being unable to stand up because something was . holding her down,’ he said. ‘She recalls being terrified at that . point.’ Cox is then said to have forced her to perform a sex act on him. Afterwards she cried and hit Cox on the thighs as she told him: ‘Please stop, please stop – I don’t want this.’ Mr Baker said: ‘She was trying to get up but felt the accused’s hand on the back of her head.’ Her cries for help were later heard . by a young couple and she was taken to a police station, where officers . described her as being ‘distressed, shivering and crying’. After hours of drinking: The woman claimed the incident happened on Bondi Beach, Sydney, which is visited by thousands of Britons every year . Police were also said to have heard her say: ‘He told me over and over again that he had a lot of money.’ Cox, who founded the Manchester-based . Quintessential Finance Group, was also on holiday in Australia when the . alleged attack took place in January last year. He had been staying in a luxury beach-side apartment in the suburb of Bronte, a few miles from Bondi. The businessman, who lists Peaches . Geldof among his Facebook friends, was arrested four days after the . alleged incident when he returned to the bar and was spotted by staff . who had been supplied with his description by police. Graeme Turnbull, defending, told the . Sydney court that the woman’s conduct ‘was entirely consistent with a . willing participant’. The jury heard that Cox had told friends the woman ‘freaked out’ after the sex act, threw her handbag in the air and ran off. As she left her belongings on the . beach, said Mr Turnbull, Cox had handed them in to a city centre police . station, where he gave his own details. Mr Turnbull also said that his client had gone back to the Bondi beach bar to ask if anyone knew the woman. ‘If he is a rapist, is that consistent?’ he asked the court. Cox denies two charges of  sex without consent. The trial continues.

"Wayne Rooney has defended his actions which saw him pick up a red card and three-match ban for Manchester United. The striker's credentials as captain of United and the England team were questioned after he kicked out at Stewart Downing. But Rooney claimed it was not malicious and that he was just trying to stop a West Ham counter-attack and got his timing wrong. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Wayne Rooney defending his red card against West Ham . Wayne Rooney has defended himself over his sending off for Manchester United against West Ham last month . Rooney (left) describes his kick out at Downing (left) as mistimed and not malicious . Rooney (centre) was sent off by referee Lee Mason (centre right) for his foul on Downing at Old Trafford . 'I was disappointed to receive the red card. I said afterwards everyone in football understands what I was trying to do and I just mis-timed it. 'It wasn't the same as red cards I've got in the past for lashing out. I tried to stop a counter attack and misjudged it.' Despite his domestic ban at present, Rooney is just three goals behind Jimmy Greaves in the England scoring charts and eight behind the country's all-time leader Sir Bobby Charlton. With San Marino and Estonia to face in the next five days, it could be assumed that the Manchester United striker could take a large step towards surpassing those landmarks, and Rooney admits it is in the back of his mind. Rooney is just nine goals away from becoming England's all-time record goalscorer . The striker (left) has admitted the England goal record is in his thoughts ahead of this week's matches . 'It's there. There's no denying it,' he said. 'Jimmy Greaves is there and if I can overtake him this week, in the coming weeks, the coming months (then) that would be great. 'It's not something going into the game (I'm) thinking: 'Oh, I've got to beat Jimmy Greaves' record to get close to Bobby Charlton'. 'I'm wanting to do well for the team and if I can score goals then great and the most important thing for us is to perform well and to win the games.' England have scored 26 goals in four matches against San Marino and conceded just one, Davide Gualtieri's infamous strike just 8.3 seconds into a World Cup qualifier in Bologna in 1993. Rooney will be demanding better concentration on Thursday, though the last two meetings in qualifying for this year's World Cup brought crushing England wins, 5-0 and 8-0. 'I am enjoying the role of captain and the responsibility and in terms of results it is going very well,' added Rooney, 'It's always nice to score goals but the most important thing is the performance and winning the game.'

Scroll down for video . Demanding justice for the death of Michael Brown, demonstrators say they'll stop this weekend's Rams game if Brown's shooter officer Darren Wilson is not arrested .

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that protestors at the meeting grew increasingly loud and angry, demanding that officer Darren Wilson, who shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown, be arrested and that County Prosecutor Robert McCullock be taken off the case, as well as calling for the resignations of both County Police Chief Jon Belmar and Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson. Speakers demanded 6th District Democractic councilman Steve Stenger as McCulloch to hand in his resignation by noon on Wednesday. '12 Noon, Stenger! 12 Noon, Stenger!' they shouted.

"Liverpool face a massive battle to persuade Raheem Sterling to sign an extension to his £30,000-a-week contract at Anfield. Although Sterling has more than two years left on his deal, Liverpool are ready to open talks on an improved contract. Sterling, 19, earns £1.5million a year basic at Anfield and it is topped up with various appearance bonuses based on first-team football, but he is no rush to commit to a new contract. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers also has an issue with Mario Balotelli. He says the striker needs to start scoring and fast. Liverpool are facing a battle to persuade Raheem Sterling (right) to sign a contract extension . Sterling (right) is in no rush to extend his £30,000-a-week contract which lasts until 2017 . Rodgers said: ‘In terms of goals, he needs to improve, it is as simple as that. Any striker — not just him — is judged on his goals and the number of assists he makes. At this moment, he has not hit the numbers he will have wanted.’ Rodgers knows that Sterling, who has scored three times in the Barclays Premier League this season, is one of the biggest teenage talents in the game. Liverpool have struggled to get going this season following the departure of Luis Suarez for Barcelona and they have already been beaten four times. Rodgers is a firm believer in rewarding progress with incremental increases to contracts for young players, but Liverpool are now competing at the very highest level. Rodgers has claimed that £16million striker Mario Balotelli (right) 'needs to improve' Rodgers fears players can fall into a comfort zone when they are rewarded with massive pay rises after showing some promise. Manchester United left back Luke Shaw, 19, signed a five-year contract worth a staggering £90,000-a-week when he moved from Southampton. Central defender Calum Chambers, also 19, is paid £40,000-a-week by Arsenal following his high-profile summer move from St Mary’s. Shaw has yet to establish himself at United and was dropped to the England Under 21 squad yesterday for the European Championship play-off against Croatia. Balotelli (above) has scored just one goal since joining Liverpool in the summer . On Thursday, England’s head coach Roy Hodgson claimed Sterling was one of the best players in the country after naming his squad for the Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia.

"Eden Hazard has ruled out any chance of leaving Chelsea for Paris Saint-Germain – despite continued interest from the mega-rich French champions. The PFA Young Player of the Year was continually linked with a move to Laurent Blanc’s side this summer but Jose Mourinho said he would only listen to offers of over £150million for his star playmaker. And despite starting his career in Ligue 1 with Lille before joining Chelsea for £32million in 2012, Hazard says he has no intention of crossing the channel again. Chelsea midfielder Eden Hazard told Canal + he doesn't want to leave Chelsea, even for Paris Saint-Germain . Belgian international Eden Hazard has been increasingly linked with a move back to Ligue 1 with PSG . The Blues are set to reward their No 10 for his fine form last season with a new five-year contract worth £200,000-per-week and expect him to put pen to paper next month. ‘PSG are in the same world than Chelsea,’ Hazard told Canal+ ‘But, to be a top club they need to win the Champions League. I'm fine with Chelsea and this is where I want to continue to grow. PSG are not in my head.’ Hazard made no secret that Chelsea’s 2012 Champions League final win over Bayern Munich made a big impact on his decision to move to West London – and his mention of the big-eared trophy with relation to PSG seems to make it highly unlikely he would move to the Financial Fair Play-hit club. Hazard recently said he wants to leave a similar mark to Frank Lampard by the time he leaves Chelsea . Hazard added: ‘Move back to Ligue 1? Maybe one day. But only for Lille. Ligue 1 is a great league in Europe but not the best. It's a league for youngsters.’ Hazard and his Chelsea team-mates fly to Portugal on Monday ahead of their Champions League tie against Sporting Lisbon hoping to improve on their performance from their opening group game – a 1-1 draw at home against Schalke.

"Pleading not guilty to terror charges:  Mufid Elfgeeh, of Rochester, New York, is shown here in his arrest photo from May this year . A convenience store manager from western New York accused of trying to provide material support to the Islamic State militant group pleaded not guilty in federal court on Thursday. Mufid Elfgeeh, 30, was indicted on seven counts earlier this week, with charges ranging from helping people to travel to Syria to fight for Islamic State, which has seized swaths of Iraq and Syria, to plotting to murder American soldiers. Elfgeeh, who remains in custody, pleaded not guilty to all seven counts during his arraignment in Rochester, New York, before U.S. Magistrate Judge Jonathan Feldman, said Barbara Burns, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney for New York's Western District. Elfgeeh, a Rochester resident, was born in Yemen but is now a naturalized U.S. citizen. The three charges of material support to Islamic State each carry a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison, and the attempted murder charge carries up to a 20-year sentence. He is due to return to court for a pretrial hearing on October 1, where prosecutors will update the court on how long it might take to complete translating the evidence into Arabic, Burns said. According to court records, Elfgeeh, beginning last year, tried to help three people - two of whom were cooperating with the FBI - to travel to Syria to fight for Islamic State, a Sunni militant group that has seized large areas of Iraq and Syria. Scroll down for video... US Marshalls lead Mufid A. Elfgeeh, 30, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Yemen, out of federal court following a hearing in Rochester, New York in June . 'Elfgeeh also plotted to shoot and kill members of the United States military who had returned from Iraq,' authorities said. 'As part of the plan to kill soldiers, Elfgeeh purchased two handguns equipped with firearm silencers and ammunition from a confidential source.' The FBI made the guns inoperable before the confidential source gave them to the suspect, the Justice Department statement said, adding Elfgeeh was in custody. 'With today's indictment of Mufid Elfgeeh, the government demonstrates that it will use all available tools to disrupt and defeat ISIS,' William Hochul, U.S. attorney for the Western District of New York, said in the statement, using an acronym for Islamic State. Court documents revealed at the indictment also allege that Elfgeeh sent $600 via Western Union to a Yemeni man he wanted to join ISIS. Mufid Elfgeeh is accused of trying to provide material support to the Islamic State by helping three men who said they would travel to Syria to engage in violent jihadî alongside the group's militants, according to the Justice Department . Meanwhile, President Barack Obama is seeking to build an international coalition to fight the militant group. The three charges of material support to Islamic State each carry a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison, and the attempted murder charge carries up to a 20-year sentence. The suspect also faces charges for possession of firearms and silencers. Disrupting and holding accountable those who seek to provide material support to foreign terrorist organizations is and shall remain a critical national security priority,"" said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Carlin. Elfgeeh was arrested in May by members of the FBI's Rochester Joint Terrorism Task Force after federal authorities said he bought two handguns and two silencers as part of a plan to kill members of the U.S. armed forces returning from war, as well as Shiites in the Rochester area. The investigation included linking Elfgeeh's home computer to tweets from alias Twitter accounts expressing support for al-Qaida, violent holy war and Sunni insurgent groups in Syria, according to court papers. On patrol: A blog affiliated with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) said Times Square could be a target for bombing . The FBI said it had been investigating Elfgeeh, a naturalized U.S. citizen, since early last year. Information on Elfgeeh's lawyer was not immediately available. Elfgeeh's publicly appointed defense attorney has said they had seen the indictment and would be entering a plea of not guilty in court on Thursday. His support for the terror group was made public on social media, with Twitter postings boasting of his love of ISIS (also known as ISIL and the the Islamic State). Elfgeeh allegedly wrote to Twitter, 'Al Qaeda said it loud and clear: we are fighting the American invasion and their hegemony over the earth and the people.' While another message about ISIS says, (they) 'will one day rule the world with the will of Allah.' FBI informants claim that the Yemeni-born owner of Mojoe's supermarket in Rochester wanted to help arm and supply ISIS with jihadists - setting up their travel arrangements and contacts under the codename 'going to the university'. Crowded: ISIS has urged supporters to create homemade pipe bombs and set them off in popular U.S. tourist destinations like Times Square (pictured) According to CNN federal investigators are also examining whether he had plans of his own to launch terror attacks within the United States. According to the affidavit heard in court on Tuesday, Elfgeeh said he could kill 'five or ten already, 15, something like that ... then w will post video or another message online' in an effort to explain why he did it. 'We want ... to start shooting those who were in the Army who went to Iraq,' he said in April according to the affidavit. Attorney General Eric Holder said the case shows the authorities are using 'all the investigative tools at our disposal'. 'We will remain aggressive in identifying and disrupting those who seek to provide support to ISIL and other terrorist groups that are bent on inflicting harm upon Americans,' Holder said. '... We are focused on breaking up these activities on the front end, before supporters of ISIL can make good on plans to travel to the region or recruit sympathizers to this cause.' This comes as ISIS called for attacks on targets on US soil. The post written on a known terrorist forum includes a list of ingredients and instructions on how to assemble a pipe bomb, with directions to set the explosives off at sites like Times Square, the Las Vegas Strip and mass-transit stations across the country.","Mufid A.

The 22-year-old bowler plays for Sydney University in grade cricket but will miss the next set of fixtures along with his New South Wales team-mate Mitchell Starc. Abbott bowled the bouncer to Hughes at the Sydney Cricket Ground during a Sheffield Shield game that proved fatal. He attended the funeral of Hughes in Macksville on Wednesday having returned to training with New South Wales the day before. Sean Abbott will miss the next set of fixtures in Sydney club cricket this weekend . The 22-year-old bowler attended the funeral of Phillip Hughes in Macksville on Wednesday . According to his state side, Abbott alone will decide whether he wants to return to first class cricket at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Tuesday. Abbott has drawn sympathy from the global cricketing community, though former players and pundits have cast doubts on his ability to play at the highest level again. New South Wales chief executive Andrew Jones said it would be Abbott's call if he wanted to play against Queensland, as it would be for the team mates who witnessed batsman Hughes' sickening injury in close during the Sheffield Shield match against South Australia. 'He's in the same boat as everybody else,' Jones said in comments published by News Ltd media. 'It's a matter for him to see what he wants to do so we'll let him make that decision.

Hughes made his first-class debut for New South Wales before switching to South Australia. Trauma experts told Reuters the impact of Hughes' death might not sink in for Abbott for weeks, but also said a return to his natural environment of training and competition, surrounded by supportive team mates, could help him recover quicker from any psychological damage. Abbott will be given time to decide whether he wants to return to first-class cricket . Hughes' grieving team mates at South Australia, who were also at his funeral in his rural home-town of Macksville, have not yet decided on whether they will play Tasmania in the next round of the Sheffield Shield next week. 'I wouldn't recommend (the players) stay away (from the sport) at all, actually,' Michael Burge, director of the Australian College of Trauma Treatment. 'They just need to be taking into account that they may be a little bit awkward or not quite on their game as they were for a few weeks. '(They should) give themselves some self-latitude, some tolerance and compassion to be, perhaps, less than their best.'","Sean Abbott will not play this weekend for Sydney University .

'Message Of The Mujahid 4', the video which is 1.43 minutes long is full . of threats and taunts to the US-led coalition that recently began air . strikes on ISIS targets in Syria and Iraq. 'I . say this about your coalition: you threaten us with your countries, . bring every nation that you wish to us, bring every nation that you want . to come and fight us. Whether it's 50 nations or 50 thousand nations it . means nothing to us,' Elmir says. Reading . from a script, a black and white scarf wrapped around his head and an . assault rifle in his hand, he warns: 'Bring your planes bring everything . you want to use because it will not harm us because we have Allah which . is something you do not have.' A spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Abbott said: 'This video again highlights the threat posed by ISIL.' 'As the Prime Minister has said on many occasions, ISIL is a threat that reaches out to Australia and our allies and partners.' ISIL is another name for ISIS. Australian terrorist Khaled Sharrouf is wanted by the Federal Police for his activities in Syria . Former Sydney boxer Mohamed Elomar posted photos of himself holding up decapitated heads on Twitter . 'We know they have the intelligence to pinpoint him. 'The . concern is that he’s being used as a tracking device to gather further . intelligence, to see where he's actually going to go.' Ms Burrows questioned how Elmir  was not stopped by Federal Police, who were thought to be monitoring him. On . Sunday, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop announced Australia will send its . special forces into Iraq to fight against Islamic State. Elmir's video was published one day after the announcement. 'Is it not apparent to you how are these victories are possible?,' he asks. 'It comes only from Allah and that is why these small numbers of soldiers that we have we take these massive victories. 'And . to the leaders, to the Obama, to Tony Abbott, I say to you this: these . weapons that we have, these soldiers will not stop fighting, we will not . put down our weapons until we reach your lands, until we take the head . of every tyrant and until the black flag is flying high in . every single land.' On . October 10, a young Australian named Abu Ousama, working as a combat . medic for a terror group in Syria, said he is still a 'true blue Aussie' despite condoning the brutal beheadings by ISIS . A young convert to Islam who killed a Canadian soldier in a hit-and-run had been on the radar of federal investigators, who feared he had jihadist ambitions and seized his passport when he tried to travel to Turkey, authorities said Tuesday. Public Safety Minister Steven Blaney said the attack Monday was 'clearly linked to terrorist ideology.' Quebec Police spokesman Guy Lapointe said the act was deliberate and that one of the two soldiers was in uniform. Police said the suspect, Martin Couture-Rouleau, called 911 to report his hit-and-run as police chased him in the Quebec city of Saint-Jean-Sur-Richelieu. He later was shot dead by police after his car flipped over into a ditch and he brandished a knife as he exited his car. A second soldier suffered minor injuries in the attack. Three teenage girls from suburban Denver may have been trying to join Islamic State militants in Syria after stealing their parents' money and flying to Germany, authorities said Tuesday. The girls — two sisters, ages 17 and 15, and their 16-year-old friend — were reported missing after they skipped school Friday, but the families had no indication of where they might have gone, said Glenn Thompson, bureau chief of the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Department . Suspicion arose when the sisters' father realized his daughters were gone, along with $2,000 and their passports. They were stopped at the Frankfurt, Germany, airport over the weekend by FBI agents and returned to Colorado where they were reunited with their families, an FBI spokeswoman said. 'We will keep on fighting and we will fight you and defeat you,' he states. As his hate-filled diatribe finishes he begins chanting in Arabic and the fighters around him join in. Monash University terror expert Professor Greg Barton said Abu Khaled was an unknown quantity. 'The big thing is this is the third time Australia's been clearly in the frame,' Prof Barton said. A . month ago, Islamic State spokesman Abu Mohammad Al-Adnani urged his . followers to murder people of a number of nationalities, including . Australians. 'Smash . his head with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over . with your car, or throw him down from a high place, or choke him,' Al-Adnani said. In this photo a member loyal to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) waves an ISIL flag in Raqqa . Ten days ago, the Islamic State's official magazine, Dabiq, also singled out Australians. 'At this point of the crusade against the Islamic State, it is very important that attacks take place in every country that has entered into the alliance against the Islamic State, especially the US, UK, France, Australia and Germany,' it said. Prime . Minister Tony Abbott explained on Wednesday that 200 members of the . Australian special forces had been waiting in the United Arab Emirates . since mid-September to take on ISIS because Baghdad had not offered them . formal legal protections. And . Australia launched their first air strikes against Islamic State . targets inside the country earlier this month as part of the U.S.-led . coalition. There . are thought to be over 100 Australians fighting with ISIS in the Middle . East, including Sydney-born friends Khaled Sharrouf and Mohamed Elomar. A . man holds up a knife as he rides on the back of a motorcycle touring . the streets of Tabqa city with others in celebration after Islamic State . militants took over Tabqa air base, in nearby Raqqa city . Sharrouf and Elomar have repeatedly taunted the authorities on social media with photos of alleged beheadings of Syrian soldiers. And on October 10, a young Australian named Abu Ousama, working as a combat medic for a terror group in Syria, said he is still a 'true blue Aussie' despite condoning the brutal beheadings by ISIS. Ousama is living among rebel fighters for Jund al-Aqsa. He took part in an interview broadcast on 7News by British photojournalist Tam Hussain who lived with the 1000 strong Islamic battalion group, which is independent of ISIS but supports their ideology. 'ISIS have taken this role of protecting the innocent Muslims of this country, of this land. 'So, they have to do what they need to do to make their state,' he said. Daily Mail Australia has contacted the Attorney General's office, the Prime Minister and DFAT for comment on the latest video.","Abdullah Elmir, 17, condemned by relatives after appearing in ISIS video .

"A California man who groped two female passengers and a retired airline employee aboard a US Airways flight in May has pleaded guilty to charges of interfering with a flight crew. Robert Coppack, 41, appeared in federal court in Philadelphia Wednesday, admitting that he was extremely drunk and acted inappropriately at the time of the incident, which caused the London-bound flight to be diverted back to Philadelphia. A somber Mr Coppack told Judge John Padova in court that he has a history of mental illness and drug addiction. He now takes medications for depression. Scroll down for video . Confession: Robert Coppack, 41, pleaded guilty to interfering with a flight crew in connection to a May 13 incident involving groping aboard a Philadelphia-to-London US Airways flight . Offloaded: Robert John Coppack was moved to the rear of the plane, where he was restrained until the aircraft returned to Philadelphia and taken away. He is now in custody . Prosecutor Sarah Grieb said it all . started when Coppack struck up a conversation with an 18-year-old . college student sitting next to him aboard US Airways Flight 728 on the . evening of May 13, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. The . California man confided in the young woman that the bottle of Gatorade . he's been sipping from actually contained alcohol, which she could smell of . his breath. He then started touching her arms and knees. Coppack . continued palming at the teen, who was traveling to the UK as part of a . college program, even after she told him to stop. Coppack . admitted that he poked another woman across the aisle in the arm and . fondled the breasts of a third passenger after he was asked to move . seats. The 41-year-old . man agreed to pay a fine and restitution to US Airways, which will likely amount to several hundred thousand dollars. Coppack is set to be sentenced December 16. He could face up to 20 years in prison. Troubled: Coppack told a judge he has a history of mental illness, and that he has been taking medication for depression . According . to an FBI affidavit from May, two women sitting with Coppack complained . about his behavior on a red-eye US Airways flight May 13, prompting . the crew to escort him to the back of the plane. Coppack then groped a retired flight attendant as he walked down the aisle, the affidavit said. Coppack, who told his seatmates he had been drinking vodka, was also aggressive and verbally abusive, the affidavit said. He was detained on board by an air marshal on the flight, and later charged with intimidating the crew and interfering with their work. Uneasy: California resident touched two female passengers 'inappropriately;' the women told flight attendants that they didn't feel comfortable sitting next to him . Flight attendants sent him to the back of the plane, and that’s where federal air marshals met him. But the incident was not quite over.  The allegation is that he threatened physical assault on the marshal. The plane arrived at Heathrow Airport in London about four hours late, airline spokeswoman Michelle Mohr said. Coppack was traveling on a British passport, and told officials he has dual citizenship, the affidavit said.","Robert Coppack, 41, admitted he was drunk when he inappropriately touched three women aboard a flight .

"Join Sportsmail's Hands Off In The Box campaign by parading the logo at matches... you could also win an England shirt signed by Jamie Redknapp, Jamie Carragher and Martin Keown by tweeting your support . Sportsmail's  campaign to stamp out the wrestling, grappling and shirt pulling in the penalty area that's ruining our game continues. Eliaquim Mangala was caught as the latest culprit of Sportsmail's 'Hands Off In The Box' campaign, when he was seen grappling in the penalty area with Newcastle United’s Paul Dummett as the Premier League champions stuttered at the Etihad Stadium. Stoke centre back Ryan Shawcross and Brighton defender Inigo Calderon were also spotted manhadling their opponents during Wednesday night's Capital One Cup action. The HANDS OFF IN THE BOX campaign can successfully assimilate into the game yellow cards for holding in the box, so it’s not something out of the ordinary. Hold or grapple and you can expect to be cautioned – and sent off if you’ve been booked already. Once fans, managers and – crucially – players accept it as normal, this campaign will have achieved its aims. Graham Poll, writing in one his recent Sportsmail column's said: 'Grappling and blocking in the box is THE No 1 issue I am asked about by football people. It used to be foul language (but it is seven years since a top-flight player was sent off for that offence) and then  goal-line technology (but that’s been dealt with effectively). 'It is time to now deal with grappling and holding in the penalty area. Tackling this issue is long overdue. It’s not about a change in the law, it’s about the appropriate enforcement of the law.' Ahead of Manchester City's Capital One Cup clash with Newcastle, one fan backing our campaign claimed Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel is one of the worst offenders and said: 'Skrtel for me is probably one of the worst culprits for that sort of behaviour, although many teams are doing that sort of thing and it needs to be addressed.'

"Liverpool's current crop of strikers may be disappointing their team-mates, but the same can't be said of loan star Divock Origi. After sending the youngster on a season-long loan to Lille, Liverpool will be keeping a close eye on the striker as his side take on Everton in the Europa League on Thursday night, and team-mate Simon Kjaer is one of his many admirers. 'He could be a truly great player for Liverpool,' the Danish defender told MirrorSport. Belgium international Divock Origi signed for Brendan Rodgers' men in June after an impressive World Cup . Brendan Rodgers swooped for the 19-year-old after he starred for Belgium last summer but agreed to immediately send him back to Lille on a season-long loan to aid his development . 'He has got great potential and could become on of the best players in his position. 'Origi is one of the greatest talents I have ever played with in Italy, Germany or France. I have no doubt about his potential. 'He's still very young and it was a clever move to let him mature one more season with Lille, but he's got the complete package - physically, technically and great speed. Lille team-mate Simon Kjaer said that Origi was extremely versatile and already possessed great technique . 'A special thing about him is that he has no real weak spots, which he needs to work on. Instead he can just work on the things he's already good at. That's a huge advantage. 'He's actually pretty versatile. We can use him on both sides and up front as well. Now I have played with Origi for a year and he really seems to have a good mentality. He is a dedicated pro at his young age.' Lille are known as the clean-sheet kings in France and will be aiming to frustrate Everton again after shutting them out a fortnight ago. Kjaer, 25, is their defensive linchpin and says he is relishing going up against Romelu Lukaku and Samuel Eto'o again after his success in their first meeting. The Danish defender said the young striker was one of the best talents he had ever played with . Mario Balotelli has underperformed since joining the club and some fans believe Origi should be recalled . 'With Lille, we are still unbeaten in the Europa League, and with another clean sheet, which is our speciality, and maybe even a win, we would still very much be in the race to advance in this tournament,' said Kjaer. 'I always enjoy playing against top class players like Eto'o, who I know quite well from games in the Serie A and with the Denmark national team, and Lukaku, who has a lot of quality. 'He is the same type of big, strong forward that I meet almost every week in France.","Divock Origi signed for Liverpool in the summer, then joined Lille on loan .

"The Queen has paid tribute to First World War volunteers today at the Royal Hospital Chelsea during a Solemn Drumhead Service of Remembrance. She was joined by the Duke of Edinburgh the Earl of Wessex, Prince Michael of Kent and Princess Alexandra for the service, held on the 100th anniversary of the assassination which helped spark the conflict. Wearing a Stewart Parvin lilac double crepe wool coat with a funnel collar, Stewart Parvin floral print dress and hat by Rachel Trevor-Morgan with flowers in it to match, the Queen braved the rain to watch the ceremony. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The Queen has paid tribute to First World war volunteers during a Drumhead Service of Remembrance at the Royal Hospital Chelsea today . The Royals braved the rain to attend the event, sitting on a covered dais during a march by reservists accompanied by the Honourable Artillery Company band . She wore a Stewart Parvin lilac double crepe wool coat with a funnel collar, Stewart Parvin floral print dress and hat by Rachel Trevor-Morgan with fabric flowers in . Her Majest was joined by her husband Prince Philip for the ceremony, which was also attended by the Earl of Wessex, Prince Michael of Kent and Princess Alexandria . Prince Philip appeared in good spirits despite the rain as he attended the event on the 100th anniversary of the assassination which sparked the conflict . She sat on a covered dais alongside her husband, who was wearing his military medals from his time serving in the Royal Navy, as the the Last Post and national anthem were played. Later she was taken out of the rain and into the hospital's chapel to be presented with a book listing volunteer military reservists and supporting auxiliaries from Greater London from 1908 to 2014. Emma Bass, a civil servant who worked on the book, called Stepping Forward, shared a laugh about the weather with the Queen. The 24-year-old, from Fulham in west London, said: 'She was really friendly and said she liked our hats. 'Her hands were wet from the rain and she said it was a bit of a shame, but she really liked the book and we spoke about it being a continuous process to find out more information. She was really lovely, kind and amazing.' After the march the couple met with civil servant Emma Bass, 24, who has written a book paying tribute to reservists from Greater London from 1908 to 2014 . The service was led by Richard Chartes (right) the Bishop of London which also featured a march by military reservists . The Royals were presented with a copy of the book Stepping Forward written by civil servant Emma Bass about military reservists from Greater London . The Royal Hospital Chelsea is the home of the famous Chelsea pensioners, retirees who have served as regular soldiers in the armed forces . The ceremony was led by Richard Chartes, the Bishop of London, and included a march by reservists accompanied by the Honourable Artillery Company band. It is held on the centenary of the shooting of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo on June 28 1914. The killing is widely viewed as setting off a chain of events that caused the First World War. After the service, the Queen was presented with Stepping Forward, a tribute to volunteer military reservists and supporting auxiliaries from Greater London from 1908 to 2014. Lieutenant Governor of the Royal Hospital Chelsea Major General Peter Currie said: 'We are honoured and delighted to hold this service in the grounds of the Royal Hospital Chelsea. 'There is no more fitting site for this event in London than the home of the Chelsea Pensioners which for over 300 years has stood as a symbol of the nation's gratitude.' Prince Edward, the Earl of Wessex (pictured), joined the Queen and Prince Philip for the ceremony, as did Prince Michael of Kent and Princess Alexandra . The Queen appeared in good spirits as she arrived at the Solem Drumhead Service despite the downpour as she was followed by her husband Prince Philip . Dressed in lavender, wearing a large brooch and a Stewart Parvin hat with fabric flower stitched in, the Queen joked with other attendees after the service was over .","Queen attended Solemn Drumhead Service of Remembrance at Royal Hospital Chelsea along with Prince Philip .

"In the latest instalment of his weekly column, Chief Sports Writer Martin Samuel gives his verdict on the footballing issues of the week, saying what made him feel warm inside and what made him shiver... WHAT'S HOT . The Championship . Specifically, the top four going into this weekend: Derby County, Ipswich Town, Brentford and Bournemouth. What’s not to like? All of those clubs would be an addition to the Premier League – but each for very different reasons. Derby County – well, Steve McClaren deserves a break. He did a great job at Twente Enschede in Holland, got Queens Park Rangers off to a good start under Harry Redknapp in the Championship last season, and was desperately unlucky not to come up with Derby in the play-offs in May. Despite that setback he kept the momentum going through the summer and now sits top of the league. Derby lead the Championship by a point after 19 gruelling games and look a solid shout for promotion . The much-maligned Steve McClaren has rejuvenated the Rams since taking over in September of last year . Brentford and Bournemouth – two new names for the Premier League, two traditionally small clubs with loyal followings. Mark Warburton at Brentford probably has the most unconventional background of any manager in the professional leagues, coming from the City of London trading floors, while Eddie Howe at Bournemouth is heading for the top division one way or another. If either club sustained their early form it would be a giant achievement. Finally, Ipswich. Dumped by Wolverhampton Wanderers, manager Mick McCarthy is again proving his worth with limited resources. Second in the league, total spending £10,000, and that on Tyrone Mings from Chippenham Town. The man’s a genius. Mark Warburton's Brentford have been one of the surprise packages after promotion from League One . Now in his second spell at Bournemouth, 37-year-old Eddie Howe (right) has guided the Cherries into fourth . Tyrone Mings has made the left back slot his own and is being watched by several Premier League clubs . Juju . According to Emmanuel Adebayor of Tottenham Hotspur the explanation for his bad form this season is juju people employed by his family casting black magic spells. And it may be worse than he thought. Juju is probably the only rational explanation for Roberto Soldado’s first Premier League goal since March 2. They conjured Soldado’s winner against Everton just to make poor Emmanuel appear even worse. Roberto Soldado (left) hit his second Premier League goal of 2014, as Emmanuel Adebayor's drought goes on . Putting your feet up . DFS, the sofa manufacture company, are the new sponsors of Team GB. You may find this ironic – a marriage of sloth and extreme athleticism – until considering some of the British Olympic Association’s other backers. Coca-Cola, McDonalds, Nissan, Panasonic and BP. So now, all in the name of supporting the team, you can fill up with petrol and drive to the local fast food chain, emerging weighed down with burgers and fizzy drinks, before heading off home to veg out on the sofa and wolf the lot down while watching the Olympics on one of the new A400 LEDs. Not forgetting that Team GB are also sponsored by P&G, just in case the whole process makes you sick, requiring Pepto-Bismol. WHAT'S NOT . Moaning about Christmas . Louis van Gaal started it. Beginning a run of nine games in 36 days with Manchester United’s 3-0 win over Hull City on Saturday, the Dutchman kicked off an intensive spell of whinging about the number of matches in December. He was quickly followed by fellow countryman Ronald Koeman, who claimed Southampton were worse off than rivals such as Manchester United, because they had the same number of fixtures – but fewer players. Maybe if they hadn’t sold half the first team that wouldn’t be such a problem. As for Van Gaal, as he is not even fully through his first season in English football, he may wish to consider that we like it like this – and that if he doesn’t, we can all see a way out. Louis van Gaal has complained about United's congested fixture list ahead of nine fixtures in 36 days . Southampton boss Ronald Koeman also berated his side's fixture pile-up ahead of the festive period . Koeman's side have suffered back-to-back defeats and take on Manchester United on Monday night . Non-apology apologies . 'I apologise if I offended anybody,' said Mario Balotelli. 'If the song offended anybody, I’m sorry,' echoed Football Association of Ireland chief John Delaney. Both delivered non-apology apologies. They’re all the rage now. 'If I offended anybody…' they begin, when the protagonist knows damn well he offended – that’s why he’s apologising. The non-apology apology also makes it appear as if the fault is with the offended for taking offence; the ‘if’ implying that they are many more sane, rational people out there who care not a jot that you sang a song about a terrorist martyr/insulted the Jews/exchanged racist text messages/engaged in sexist banter/committed rape, not all of which can be attributed to Balotelli and Delaney, of course. Nobody says sorry any more; and even when they do, it’s still your fault. Mario Balotelli made a non-apology apology after his post on Instagram caused a storm . Wes Morgan . It has not been a good week for the captain of Leicester City. He put through his own net against Queens Park Rangers last Saturday, his weak header gifted Liverpool an equaliser on Tuesday, and he was then sent off. Mick McCarthy, during his time playing centre half for Manchester City, went on a similarly bleak run. Asked about his latest blunder, he did not shirk. 'Anyone can have a bad career,' deadpanned Mick. Wes Morgan wants the ground to cave in after scoring QPR's equaliser during Leicester's loss at Loftus Road . Morgan's week to forget continued after being dismissed by Lee Mason in the 3-1 defeat by Liverpool .","Steve McClaren deserves a break and he's kept momentum going at Derby .

"DeMarco Murray ran for a season-high 179 yards and a touchdown while quarterback Tony Romo threw for three more as the Dallas Cowboys beat the Chicago Bears 41-28 on Thursday. The Cowboys (9-4) made it look easy for most of the night against a struggling team that lost star receiver Brandon Marshall to a rib injury. Dallas ensured it will finish the regular season with more wins than losses for the first time since 2009, but is looking for more, with an NFC East title and first playoff appearance in five years in sight. Led by Romo and Murray, Dallas rebounded from a blowout loss to the Eagles on Thanksgiving and pulled within half a game of them in the standings with another meeting in Philadelphia next week. DeMarco Murray scores a touchdown for the Dallas Cowboys in their win at Soldier Field . Tony Romo threw three touchdown passes as the Cowboys ran out 41-28 winners in Chicago . The Cowboys took a 14-7 halftime lead and scored 21 unanswered in the third quarter before the Bears (5-8) rallied in the fourth. With that, the Cowboys improved to a league-best 6-0 on the road this season. Romo, who has been bothered by a bad back, completed 21 of 26 passes for 205 yards. Murray, the league's leading rusher, carried 32 times. He also had 49 yards receiving. Dez Bryant had six receptions for 82 yards and Cole Beasley caught two touchdowns. For the Bears, Marshall's injury was another low in a disappointing season that will likely end with them missing the playoffs for the seventh time in eight years. Running back Murray racked up a season high 179 yards at Soldier Field on Thursday . Alshon Jeffery catches a touchdown pass from Jay Cutler for the Chicago Bears . He was hurt taking a knee to the right side from the Cowboys' Barry Church following a reception in the second quarter. That happened moments after he made a spectacular 42-yard catch, juggling the ball with his right hand, to help set up a touchdown. He stayed down for several minutes and gingerly walked off the field. He left Soldier Field in an ambulance, but later posted on Twitter, 'Thanks for the Prayers. .. I'm Good.' Jay Cutler was 32 of 46 for 341 yards and two touchdowns, but the Bears had trouble sustaining any drives or stopping the Cowboys. They also did not get much from the run game, although they made a little more of an effort after managing just eight attempts in the loss at Detroit a week earlier. Joseph Randle runs in another touchdown for the Cowboys as they picked up a vital victory . Matt Forte had 13 carries for 26 yards after tying a career low with five rushes last week. Cowboys defensive tackle Josh Brent played for the first time this season after serving a 10-game suspension for his intoxication manslaughter conviction. He hadn't played since Dec. 2, 2012, six days before the drunken-driving crash that killed teammate Jerry Brown. He was suspended the first 10 games and was inactive for two more. The Bears were without kicker Robbie Gould (right thigh) and defensive tackle Jeremiah Ratliff (knee).","Dallas Cowboys beat Chicago Bears to stay in NFC East race .

"Adventurers have stumbled across a cave so enormous that it has its own weather system, complete with wispy clouds and lingering fog inside vast caverns. A team of expert cavers and photographers have been exploring the vast cave system in the Chongquing province of China and have taken the first-ever photographs of the natural wonder. They were amazed to discover the entrance to the hidden Er Wang Dong cave system and were stunned when they managed to climb inside to see a space so large that it can contain a cloud. Scroll down for video . The view from a small window in the wall of the vast Niubizi Tian Keng in the Er Wang Dong cave system, where clouds form inside the huge spaces. Three tiny explorers can be seen negotiating the heavily vegetated floor . An intrepid cave explorer ascends a rope hanging from the Niubizi Tian Keng. This photograph is one of the first-ever images taken of one of a cave so large it has its own weather system . Photographer and caver Robbie Shone, from Manchester, was part of a team of 15 explorers on a month-long expedition that discovered the hidden system. 'A few of the caves had previously been used by nitrate miners, at the areas close to the entrance, but had never been properly explored before,' he said. 'All the major passageways were deep underground and had never seen light before. Explorer Duncan Collis (pictured) climbs a thin rope up to a small ledge overlooking the vast floor surface of Niubizi Tian Keng in the Er Wang Dong cave system.

One of the explorers said they had to be aware of high water levels inside the caves, especially when it rained heavily on the surface . 'It is always very special, knowing that you are the first to step foot into a cave or somewhere where nobody had previously seen, not knowing what you might find and discover. 'Where else on Earth can still hold secrets and mysteries of discovery? That's what I love so much about exploring. Mr Shones was particularly excited about the cave network's interior weather system. The spectacular beddings in the roof of Quankou. Photographer and caver Robbie Shone, from Manchester, was part of a team of 15 explorers on a month-long expedition who stumbled across the natural wonder . The underground camp in Sang Wang Dong is cosy and warm, according to the cavers. Hot food and drink recharge weary and tired explorers who sleep in either suspended hammocks or on roll mats on the floor, before venturing out into the vast surroundings . American speleologist Erin Lynch peers down over her shoulder into a giant void of cloud.The floor is over 240m below and although it cant be seen due to the thick cloud that lingers around her, the echo that reverberates several seconds later reminds her of the volume of empty space and her lofty location . 'I had never seen anything quite like the inside cloud ladder before,' he said. 'Thick cloud and fogs hangs in the upper half of the cave, where it gets trapped and unable to escape through the small passage in the roof, 250m above the ground. 'It reminded me of being in an abandoned slate quarrying North Wales in bad weather. The cave system discovered is not the only one with clouds inside, as humidity rises inside the caverns into colder air to form clouds inside the giant, enclosed spaces. Large stalagmites at the foot of a giant ascending ramp to another level of development in San Wang Dong create a spectacle mid-way through a section of cave called Crusty Duvets . A giant calcite stalactite boss, dwarfs team member Matt Ryan as he looks up at the giant geological feature . The network, includes 'Cloud Ladder Hall' which itself  measures around 51,000 metres squared, while there are rivers and vegetation on the floor of some of its huge caverns. 'Most caves are either accessed by large walking entrance, some require a long deep swim, other may be very vertical in nature where you need ropes to abseil down the walls deep into the caves. 'We had to be aware of high water levels inside the caves, especially when it rained heavily on the surface. 'The drainage catchment to these caves is massive and soon the caves can be extremely dangerous and impassable,' he added.

"CSKA Moscow were punished for grappling in the box during their 2-1 win over Manchester City on Wednesday night. Sportsmail’s ‘Hands Off In The Box’ campaign continues to gather pace, with CSKA the latest offenders - and they were duly punished, albeit by Yaya Toure rather than referee Tasos Sidiropoulos. City were awarded a free kick 25-yards out after eight minutes and as Yaya Toure stood over the ball, Sergei Ignashevich was grappling with Vincent Kompany, who had joined the CSKA wall. Ignashevich bundled Kompany out of the wall but in doing so created a gap for Toure to curl the ball through and score to make it 1-1 on the night. CSKA eventually went on to win an ill-tempered game, in which Toure was sent off for a moment of madness after he pushed XX to get a second yellow card. Yaya Toure scores Manchester City's only goal of the game during their defeat to CSKA Moscow . Seydou Doumbia was again City's nemesis, following up his influential role in last month's 2-2 draw in Moscow with both CSKA goals. His Ivory Coast team-mate Toure had cancelled out his first with a superb free-kick - but City again lacked spark in Europe's elite competition. The result left them with just two points from four games and bottom of the group. City could have had two penalties in the dying minutes but Sergio Aguero, denied two spot-kicks in Sunday's Manchester derby, was twice refused again. There were plenty of other issues surrounding the game, with no CSKA fans having officially been sold tickets but a number making themselves heard.

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers attracted criticism for his decision to field a weakened team against Real Madrid in the Champions League on Tuesday night. With one eye on Saturday's Premier League clash with Chelsea, the Reds boss decided to take big names Steven Gerrard, Raheem Sterling and Mario Balotelli out of his line-up in the Bernabeu. The thrashing many predicted did not materialise as Real won 1-0 but we will have to wait until the weekend to see if Rodgers' gamble pays off. Here are 10 other examples of managers who have decided to field weakened teams and whether or not it was worth the risk. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers decided to rest key players ahead of Saturday's match with Chelsea . 1. Alan Pardew - Newcastle, 2013 . The Newcastle boss fielded a semi-reserve side for the return leg against Benfica in the Europa League quarter-final, trailing 3-1 from Lisbon. Pardew at the time said he was targeting the Tyne-Wear derby at the weekend, resting Hatem Ben Arfa, Sylvain Marveaux and Shola Ameobi. It didn't go to plan, losing 4-2 on aggregate to the Portuguese side and seeing Paolo Di Canio's famous knee slide at St James' as Sunderland ran out 3-0 winners. Pointless. Newcastle manager Alan Pardew decided to field a reserve team against Benfica in a Europa League tie . Pardew watches on as Sunderland boss Paolo Di Canio celebrates in Sunderland's win the following weekend . 2. Mick McCarthy - Wolves, 2009 . One of few clubs to receive a fine for using the full squad, McCarthy made 10 changes for a trip to Manchester United just three days after beating Tottenham at White Hart Lane. They predictably lost 3-0 at Old Trafford, but recalled nine players for the next game, a win over Burnley. Wolves took the £25,000 fine on the chin and avoided relegation. Job done. Mick McCarthy and Wolves were fined £25,000 for putting out a weakened team against Man United in 2009 . 3. Martin O'Neill - Aston Villa, 2009 . Level at 1-1 from the first leg at Villa Park, O'Neill put out the likes of Marc Albrighton, Mustafa Salifou and Nathan Delfouneso for the trip to CSKA Moscow. Villa lost 2-0 and the 2,000 fans that made the long, cold trip were rightly miffed. O'Neill put on a dinner for the travelling support to apologise for the decision, but Villa's season crumbled. They failed to win in their next eight games, finishing sixth having held a healthy lead over Arsenal in fourth. Martin O'Neill was forced to apologise to Aston Villa fans after fielding a weakened team in Moscow in 2009 . 4. George Graham - Arsenal, 1993 . Spurs finished above Arsenal just over two decades ago after Graham played a weakened side four days before the FA Cup Final against Sheffield Wednesday. Tottenham have only finished above their rivals once since, and having lost 3-1 on the day at Highbury, Graham made 11 changes for the Wembley showdown. Arsenal went on to lift the FA Cup despite needing a replay against the Owls. George Graham may have won the FA Cup and League Cup in 1993 but Spurs finished above them in the league . 5. Ian Holloway - Blackpool, 2010 . In their first season in the Premier League, Blackpool boss Holloway made 10 changes to the side that drew with Everton for the trip to Aston Villa. His decision was almost vindicated, losing 3-2 to a last-minute James Collins goal before picking up 11 points from their next possible 15. Blackpool were fined £25,000 to the dismay out the outspoken Holloway, who told reporters he would be handing in his resignation. He didn't, and Blackpool ended up relegated. Ian Holloway's Blackpool ended up being relegated in 2010 despite his efforts to rotate players . 6. Gary Megson - Bolton, 2008 . Gary Megson was heavily criticised by Bolton fans after deciding to field a second-string team in a 2008 UEFA Cup last 16 tie with Sporting Lisbon. With one eye on a Premier League relegation showdown with Wigan the following Sunday, Megson omitted an entire XI from the party that travelled to Portugal. The gamble back-fired spectacularly for Megson, whose side not only lost 1-0 to Sporting but were then beaten by the same scoreline by a Wigan side reduced to 10 men after just four minutes. It took until the penultimate weekend of the season for Bolton to secure their top-flight status and they have not played in Europe since. Gary Megson fielded a weakened team when Bolton played Sporting Lisbon in the UEFA Cup in order to rest key players for an important relegation decider with Wigan, which they also lost . The decision was not a popular one with the Bolton fans, who called for Megson to be sacked . 7. Garry Monk - Swansea, 2014 . Monk chose to concentrate on a forthcoming Europa League round of 32 tie with Napoli when he made eight changes to the team he sent out in the FA Cup at Everton six days before. Swansea played fairly well at Goodison Park but lost the fifth round tie 3-1 and were unable to beat Napoli too despite a first-choice team. The first leg at the Liberty Stadium ended goalless before the Italian side prevailed 3-1 in Naples a week later. Swansea boss Garry Monk decided to rest key players in an FA Cup fifth round tie with Everton ahead of a Europa League last 32 tie with Napoli last season . Everton went on to win the Cup tie at Goodison Park 3-1, with Leighton Baines (left) one of the scorers . 8. George Allison - Arsenal, 1936 . Fielding under-strength sides is not necessarily a modern phenomenon. Arsenal were fined £250 way back in 1936 when manager George Allison fielded under-strength sides in a succession of league matches. The Gunners had beaten Barnsley to reach the semi-finals of the FA Cup and had a favourable draw against Grimsby Town. They were only seventh in the league standings and so Allison drafted in half-a-dozen players who'd never played for the club to turn out in the dead rubber league fixtures and protect his star names. Despite the fine, Arsenal went on to win the Cup, beating Sheffield United 1-0 with their first choice XI. The Arsenal squad line up for their team photo in 1936. Manager George Allison is far left on the bottom row . 9. Rafael Benitez - Liverpool, 2007 . With a Champions League final against AC Milan on the horizon, Rafael Benitez made nine changes for Liverpool's penultimate Premier League game of the 2006-2007 season at Fulham. The London side duly won the match 1-0, thanks to a Clint Dempsey goal, and recorded their first victory in 11 league matches. Fulham duly stayed up but Neil Warnock, whose Sheffield United side suffered relegation as a consequence of Benitez's squad rotation, was left fuming. Liverpool lost the Champions League final to Milan. Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez influenced the Premier League relegation battle in 2007 . Clint Dempsey celebrates Fulham's winner against Liverpool in May 2007 after the Reds rested key players . 10. Jose Mourinho - Chelsea, 2014 . Even though his side still had a chance of winning the Premier League title last season, Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho decided to prioritise the Champions League and put out a weakened side in a top-of-the-table clash with Liverpool. It proved a masterstroke, as goals from Demba Ba and Willian secured victory at Anfield, denting Liverpool's title ambitions and ultimately allowing Manchester City through to claim the trophy. But Mourinho didn't feel the benefit in the Champions League a few days later as Atletico Madrid won 3-1 at Stamford Bridge to reach the final.

"Germany has called on Britain not to celebrate the centenary of the First World War but to focus on the idea that the European Union brought peace to the continent. The government in Berlin recently sent a special envoy to the UK amid fears that the way Britain marks the Great War could affect relations with Angela Merkel’s administration. Andreas Meitzner called for talks with defence minister Andrew Murrison as well as officials from the Foreign Office and the Department of Culture who are handling the commemorations, which start next year. A German envoy has voiced concerns over the commemorations taking place to mark the 100-year anniversary of World War One . The German envoy says it would be better to focus on the shared loss of all countries involved in the conflict . British historians have called on the . UK Government to acknowledge that the conflict was a just war to . prevent German domination of Europe and to celebrate victory. But Norman Walter, press attaché at . the German embassy in London, said ‘it would be easier’ for Britain to . adopt a ‘less declamatory tone’ if it wants Germany to take part. In an interview yesterday he said: . ‘We can’t tell you how you should celebrate, but our feeling is that . issues about who was guilty and all that should be left more or less to . historians and shouldn’t feature dominantly in politicians’ speeches. ‘The biggest single contribution to . the start of the First World War was Germany, but others played a part. Whether it was a win or not, it wasn’t worth it. ‘We would prefer not to have any . celebrations, having lost. We don’t want to commemorate the battles. We . want to commemorate the dead.’ He said that commemorations on the . continent would focus on the benefits of the EU. He said: ‘The European . idea is something that helped us overcome the situation where a war like . this could start, where European countries could go to war with one . another. ‘It may sound far-fetched here, but . it doesn’t elsewhere in Europe. The European community will very much be . part of the German commemoration. Thankfully we have the European . Union.’ Philip Davies, who sits on the . Culture Select Committee, denounced the idea that the European Union has . kept peace since the Second World War as ‘outrageous’, since tensions . over the eurozone have led to anti-German sentiment across the EU. He told the Mail: ‘This attitude is . unacceptable. The Germans might want to forget their history and pretend . things didn’t happen, but we are not prepared to do that. ‘As for Europe being a cause of . peace, this chap’s obviously forgotten the reaction Angela Merkel got . from the Greeks the last time she went there. People dressed up in Nazi . uniforms, accusing her of completing Hitler’s work. ‘I don’t think people in Greece are celebrating peace. The European Union seems to be having the opposite effect.’ Tory MP Chris Skidmore, a historian . who sits on the Speaker’s advisory committee on the war, told the Mail . the events to mark the 100th anniversary should focus on why the war . began and acknowledge  the victors. He said: ‘The Great War still casts a . shadow over modern Europe today. It’s entirely right that we be . respectful and commemorate the fallen from whichever side. But it would . be a failure to history if we didn’t recognise not only the causes and . consequences of the war, but that there were winning sides and losing . sides.’ The Centenary Advisory Board of . historians, writers, religious leaders and retired military figures is . the main body advising the Government on commemorations. Professor Sir Hew Strachan of Oxford . University, one of the panel members who has called for a greater . emphasis on celebrations, said: ‘I understand Germany’s position. There . is no virtue in offending Germany. ‘But if we are going to be honest to . the history of this war from a British perspective, then it can’t all be . about waste and futility.  A lot of people fought and died thinking it . was worthwhile. We need to respect what those motivations were.’","Envoy says remembrance, not victory, should be focus of anniversary .

"The FBI and the U.S. Department of Justice have acknowledged that flawed testimony from FBI scientists based on forensic evidence has resulted in wrongful conviction in thousands of cases - including some people on death row. An investigation launched in 2012 after it was discovered that evidence based on flawed forensic testing of hair found at crimes scenes could have led to the conviction of potentially innocent people for serious crimes such as rape and murder in the 1980s and 1990s. This week, it was reported that of the 10 per cent of cases that have been reviewed thus far, the 'vast majority' were mistakes. Exact science: Before DNA testing, FBI scientist's testified in cases on evidence obtained using an inexact microscopic comparison method, which means thousands of convictions must be reexamined . New Scientist reports that 136 defendents, including two who are on death row, will receive letters explaining their rights to DNA testing to prove their evidence. A further 23 similar letters were sent out last year, and 14 of those were on death row. The hair analysis test in question involved scientist looking at hairs recovered from crimes scenes under a microscope. They would compare these to hairs from the defendent to find a match - but in the days before DNA testing, it was impossible to confirm the match to the exclusion of all others, as the scientists claimed. The Washington Post reports that the FBI stopped its review of convictions last August after the initial troubling findings but resumed this month after at the Justice Department's orders. A report from the department's inspector general found that the FBI and Justice Department didn't move quickly enough to identify the cases handled by 13 FBI crime lab examiners whose work was found to be flawed, meaning defendants sometimes were never notified that their convictions may have been based on bad science. It took almost five years for the FBI to identify the more than 60 death-row defendents whose cases required further examination, and during that time at least three were executed. 'I don’t know whether history is repeating itself, but clearly the [latest] report doesn’t give anyone a sense of confidence that the work of the examiners whose conduct was first publicly questioned in 1997 was reviewed as diligently and promptly as it needed to be,' Michael R. Bromwich, who was inspector general from 1994 to 1999, told the Washington Post. Delays: So far, only 10 per cent of the cases that need to be reexamined have been looked at, but the 'vast majority' were found to have hinged on flawed science . The investigation was stopped due to 'a vigorous debate that occurred within the FBI and DOJ about the appropriate scientific standards we should apply when reviewing FBI lab examiner testimony — many years after the fact,' according to the FBI. 'Working closely with DOJ, we have resolved those issues and are moving forward with the transcript review for the remaining cases,' the FBI said. The flawed hair and fiber comparison is just one of many methods used by FBI scientists that could prove problematic. According to New Scientist, ballistics, fibre analysis, tyre and shoeprint comparison and tool and bite-mark analysis all use a similar inexact approach. Experts say this could be just the tip of the iceberg and that there will be a landslide of similar cases involving state labs which used scientists trained by the FBI. 'Nobody who attended any of the FBI classes was told to over testify, that's not part of the training,' Max Houck, a former FBI hair analyst who taught some of these classes and now heads the Department of Forensic Sciences in Washington DC told New Scientist. 'However, our fear was always that we teach these people for two weeks, and they would go back to their laboratories with a certificate of completion and be told: ""Great you're qualified to do this – here's your caseload.""' So far, 2,600 cases are being questioned but only 10 per cent have been reexamined in the two years since the investigation begun. Peter Neufeld, co-director of the Innocence Project which fights to free innocent people using DNA testing, says it's rare that a person would be convicted on a single piece of evidence, but that hair matching would have carried heavy weight. 'Combined with an unreliable witness statement, it could create a perfect storm,' he told New Scientist.","The FBI and the Justice Department are re-examining thousands of convictions based on forensic evidence .
In the 1980s and '90s, FBI scientists testified in criminal cases based on flawed science .
The method involved comparing hairs from the defendant to ones obtained from the crime scene under microscope .
Presented by many scientists as irrefutable, the method is inexact .
Letters are being sent to many inmates, some on death-row, explaining their right to DNA testing to prove their innocence ."
"Whether you are suffering from jetlag or hope to make the long wait for your next flight a dream, a pod-nap could be the answer to your bed-time prayers. Travellers and tourists finding themselves stuck in the departure lounge at Abu Dhabi International Airport are now able to catch up on some shut-eye in a futuristic-looking 'sleeping pod'. Unveiled this week, the 'GoSleep' pod offers time away from noise, light and crowds of the airport and only costs £8 for one hour's alone-time. Pod night's sleep? Weary travellers looking to catch up on their 40 winks at Abu Dhabi airport can now take to these futuristic-looking sleep pods . The 'GoSleep' feature a partial or fully enclosed sliding shade where customers can sit comfortably and enjoy a peaceful moment alone, or take a nap while entirely cocooned inside the pod. Ten pods have been installed at Abu Dhabi International Airport with a further 35 on order for later this year. The airport's pods boasts wifi internet access, along with power points to charge electronic equipment. Mohammed Al Bulooki, chief commercial officer at Abu Dhabi Airports Company, said: ‘The introduction of 'GoSleep' sleeping pods is another step towards exceeding customers' expectations and delivering world-class levels of service. Shut-eye shut in:  The chair converts into a private flat bed and only costs £8 an hour for those in need of a nap . ‘Abu Dhabi Airports Company is proud that it is the first airport in the world to have secured an agreement to install the very latest passenger experience that embraces the latest technology. ‘The installment of these innovative new convertible chairs highlights ADAC's commitment to using the latest technologies to improve airport facilities, ensuring that passengers have the best experience whilst visiting Abu Dhabi International Airport.’ Abu Dhabi International Airport  is one of the fastest growing airports in the world, currently undergoing a $6.8 billion facelift in the hopes that it will be able to compete with nearby Dubai airport. 'Pod-style' sleeping arrangements at busy airport terminals are by no means a new invention, and many international airports, including London's Heathrow, offer sleeping pods which can be rented by the hour for busy travellers on the go.","Ten pods have been installed at Abu Dhabi International Airport .

"Gary Lineker accused Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers of throwing in the towel by selecting a weakened team against Real Madrid. Rodgers flew in the face of convention by taking out big names like Steven Gerrard, Raheem Sterling and Mario Balotelli for Liverpool’s biggest European assignment since 2009.

Steven Gerrard (left), Glen Johnson (centre) and Jordan Henderson watch on from the bench in Madrid . The changes, which come ahead of Chelsea’s visit to Anfield in the Barclays Premier League on Saturday, prompted Lineker to criticise Rodgers on Twitter and describe his selection as ‘unbefitting of a club of Liverpool’s stature’. Lineker tweeted: ‘Rodgers has left out Henderson, Sterling, Balotelli, Gerrard and Coutinho at Real Madrid. He has, though, thrown in a white towel. ‘Selecting a weakened side in Europe’s premier competition, especially against Real Madrid, is unbefitting of a club of Liverpool’s stature. ‘If I were one of Liverpool’s star players, I’d be choked to be left out of a game at the Bernabeu against the European champions.’ Lineker claimed he would be choked at being left out of such a huge European fixture at the Bernabeu .

Rodgers, however, insisted he had nothing to apologise for and hit back, saying Lineker lacked the know-how to appreciate why he made the decisions. Rodgers said: ‘Gary is a figure I respect and he was a top player but he has never been a manager, so probably doesn’t truly understand what you are up against in terms of planning forward that way. ‘We were certainly far from throwing it away. You know, Cristiano Ronaldo has scored in every game since the Spanish Super Cup final. That shows you how hard we defended and how hard we worked.

Scholes said on ITV: ‘I think Steven Gerrard is capable of playing in this game and on Saturday (against Chelsea). It is Tuesday night, he’ll have two days’ recovery, train Friday, play Saturday and he’s got a nice little two weeks off.

"A Swedish man has been pulled barely alive from his snow-covered car having survived on nothing but snow for two months in sub-zero temperatures. Peter Skyllberg, 44, had eaten nothing but handfuls of snow since December 19 . when his car became bogged down in drifts near the town of Umea in northern . Sweden. Pictures of the vehicle's interior show the dashboard and seats covered in ice after temperatures plunged to -30C. Igloo effect: Peter Skyllberg somehow survived inside this icebound car for two months by eating handfuls of snow as temperatures plunged as low as -30C . Baltic conditions: This picture shows just how much ice had built up inside the vehicle. Mr Skyllberg also appears to have had food and drink supplies, albeit limited ones . Frozen in: The Swede's car was found covered in 2ft of snow after getting trapped in drifts on December 19 . Trapped: Mr Skyllberg was eventually discovered near the town of Umea on the north-east coast of Sweden . Experts think he went into a kind of human hibernation which slowed down his metabolism and pulled him through the ordeal in what they have described as the 'case of a lifetime'. Mr Skyllberg had driven off the main road on to forest tracks where his car became . stuck fast. On Friday a passing man on a snowmobile stopped to scrape . snow from the windscreen of the vehicle and saw movement inside. As he recovered in a hospital today . details emerged of depression and debts piling up on him and it is . thought he might have been trying to take his own life. Police initially thought he was a nature lover who had become trapped in the snow while on an expedition to photograph elk. But now it emerges there was a court judgment against him in December because of debts totaling £150,000. Neighbours of his in the town of . Orebro in central Sweden said he had also broken up with his girlfriend . and had lost contact with his father and other family members 20 years . ago. 'We now have to wait until he is better to try to find out what really was in his mind,' said police officer Ebbe Nyberg. Mr Skyllberg survived by taking handfuls of snow from the roof of the car. The only . other things found with him were cigarettes and comic books. Some protection: Mr Skyllberg did at least have warm clothes and a sleeping bag with him (left) in his car . 'Absolutely . incredible that he is alive, in part considering that he hasn’t had any . food, but also bearing in mind that it was really cold for a while . there after Christmas,' said a member of the emergency services team . deployed to rescue him. The case of Peter Skyllberg is so extraordinary doctors and medical experts are still trying to establish exactly how the 44-year-old survived in such extreme circumstances. One theory being put forward by Dr Stefan Branth, from Uppsala University, is that Mr Skyllberg's metabolism may have slowed down 'like a bear that hibernates', making it easier to go without food. But Ulf Segerberg, the chief medical officer at Umea University Hospital, said it was more likely because of the insulation provided by his vehicle. 'It is not possible for humans to hibernate like a bear,' he said. 'In the car, he had very warm clothes, he had a warm sleeping bag, and as the car was snowed under, that would have made it more like an igloo.' He was emaciated, barely able to move and could barely speak. 'He was at the end of his tether,' said a police spokesman. 'It was doubtful he could have survived one or two more days.' He was wrapped up in a sleeping bag . in the car but he had no other warmth; the fuel had run out long ago as . he kept the heater running to try to survive as the thermometer plunged . on some nights to -30C. Pictures also show food wrappers and drink cartons , which suggests he may have had supplies with him for at least some of the time. Mr Skyllberg is recovering in the intensive care ward at Umea University Hospital where he is being fed liquid proteins. He has hypothermia and is severely malnourished. He was never registered as missing, for which there is currently no explanation. Policeman Nyberg added: 'He was in a very . poor state when we found him. He could not speak, just a few broken . sentences and the words snow...eat. And he managed to say he hadn’t . eaten anything since December.'","Emaciated Swede, 44, discovered after living off handfuls of snow .

"Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer both cruised to victories on day three of the ATP Swiss Indoors in Basle. Nadal reached the quarter-finals in just 57 minutes with a 6-1, 6-1 win against Frenchman Pierre-Hugues Herbert, before top seed Roger Federer crushed Gilles Muller  6-2, 6-1 in just 46 minutes to reach the second round. Second seed Nadal, playing just his third tournament since Wimbledon due to a wrist injury, broke qualifier Herbert's serve five times.

It was even easier for Federer, who broke Muller in the sixth game and wrapped up the first set in 25 minutes, winning 91 percent of his first-serve points. The second set was even quicker as Federer totally dominated Muller, who failed to win a single point on Federer's serve, as the 17-time Grand Slam champion's ninth ace took him to match point. Federer, who improved to 5-0 against Muller in career head-to-heads, next plays Denis Istomin of Uzbekistan and leads him 5-0 too.

"Off the coast of Isla de Mujeres near the Mexican city of Cancun a hidden world lies buried 28ft beneath the ocean waves. The Cancun Underwater Museum, also known as MUSA, is a collection of sculptures deliberately placed on the ocean floor by English artist Jason deCaires Taylor. Each of the 460 statues in the underwater exhibition are made from PH-neutral marine concrete designed to encourage marine plants to grow and attract fish to the region, and the museum was set up to draw tourists away from nearby coral reefs. The Cancun Underwater Museum, also known as MUSA, is a collection of sculptures created by English artist Jason deCaires Taylor. The exhibition is placed underwater off the coast of Isla de Mujeres and Cancun, Mexico. Each of the statues and items on display are made from PH-neutral marine concrete . According to the tourist board, around 300,000 people visit the . area each year, . but snorkeling groups have been known to cause damage to marine life, for example, by kicking them as they swim past. Jaime Gonzalez, director of the West . Coast National Park, said: 'If they swim near the corals, the divers . with little experience might kick them with a fin or hit them with the . oxygen tank. Before it was . declared a park, the tourists even climbed up the corals and walked on . top of them, breaking and shattering them.' DeCaires-Taylor added: 'Something had to be done about the . damage to the local reef areas. Hurricanes, tropical storms and mankind . were taking their toll on these natural gardens.' He came up with the idea of submerging life-sized statues in . order to create an artificial reef area where coral could . grow, and in which marine life and fish could live and breed. The MUSA collection is made up of 450 life-sized sculptures, like the one pictured. Some 400 sculptures were submerged in 2010 and 50 new ones were added in August 2012. The whole display is known as Silent Evolution . DeCaires Taylor designed the sculptures to become artificial reefs in a bid to draw tourists away from the coral reefs off the coast of Cancun. The natural reefs were becoming damaged because snorkelers would accidentally kick them as they swam through. The project began in 2009 and many of the displays, pictured left and right, have already started growing plants and attracting marine life although this gives the statues an eerie appearance . Many of the statues were made to resemble members from the local community in Isla Mujeres. This image shows one of the models, far left, and the various stages of marine life growth on his neutral concrete statue since 2009, from left to right. As well as encouraging growth, the artificial reef will change over time giving tourists a different look each time . DeCaires Taylor then teamed up . with Gonzalez as well as Roberto Diaz, . the President of the Nautical Association for Cancun and Isla Mujeres, to create the attraction. Around . 400 of the sculptures were submerged in 2010 and 50 new statues were added . in August 2012. The whole display is known as Silent Evolution. Some corals, including fire coral, have been planted on and near the . initial sculptures to encourage more coral to grow. The statues themselves have also naturally become . covered with coral over time. The designers collected the coral from damaged fragments washed up following tropical storms. They also grew a small portion artificially. As well as encouraging . growth, the artificial reef will change over time giving tourists a . different look each time they visit. The statues in the display form the shape of an eye which helps disperse currents and tropical storms. A number of fish species have returned to the area after not being seen for years. Over 100 angelfish, pictured, were recently spotted surrounding the statues . Fire coral was planted on a number of the statues, left and right, to encourage other marine life to grow. Fire coral is a fast growing coral that was placed in the holes of each of these statues. The designers collected the coral from damaged fragments washed up following tropical storms. They also grew a small portion artificially .

Many of the statues were made to . resemble members from the local community in Isla Mujeres, while others . were designed especially for the display. These include a sculpture of a suited man with his head buried in the sand, called The Banker.

"A 15-year-old prisoner accused of having fought for ISIS has described how the terrorists murder women who show their skin and drug young men to convince them to carry out suicide attacks. A group of accused men are being held in northern Syria after being captured earlier this year by Kurdish troops battling to force the jihadists out of the area. While many of the prisoners deny being involved, teenager Kareem Mufleh readily admits his links to ISIS - claiming he had been threatened with beheading if they did not join the terror group. Mufleh was eventually captured by Kurdish fighters in June, during a firefight in which he was shot three times in the stomach, leaving massive scars. Scroll down for video . Experience: In order to ensure their largely reluctant recruits give their all in battle, ISIS makes them take the anti-anxiety drug Zolam to  make militants willing suicide bombers, 15-year-old Kareem Mufleh claimed . Claims: Accused fighter Kareem Mufleh (standing) described how Islamic State terrorists murder women who show their skin and are known to drug young men in order to convince them to carry out suicide bomb attacks . The men accused of being Islamic State fighters were interviewed in the basement of their prison in  northern Syria by Holly Williams, a correspondent for CBS News. Among those interviewed was 15-year-old Kareem Mufleh, who openly tells of having fought for ISIS - something none of the other men in the jail admit to. His face was covered throughout the interview, presumably so ISIS fighters wouldn't recognise him. But rather than joining the group voluntarily, Mufleh says the militants entered his village and gave all the men there the option of joining their campaign of terror or face being beheaded. In order to ensure their largely reluctant recruits give their all in battle, ISIS makes them take the anti-anxiety drug Zolam to make the fighters' willing suicide bombers, Mufleh claimed. 'That drug makes you lose your mind... If they give you a suicide belt and tell you to blow yourself up, you'll do it,' he said. Accused: A group of accused men are being held in northern Syria after being captured earlier this year by Kurdish troops battling to force the jihadists out of the area . Injury: 15-year-old Kareem Mufleh revealed three large wounds on his stomach which he claims were received while fighting the Kurdish troops who would eventually take him captive . Describing the horrors of his time in ISIS' ranks, Mufleh says: 'I even saw them kill a woman because her wedding dress showed her neck and bare arms.' He also revealed three large wounds on his stomach which he claims were received while fighting the Kurdish troops who would eventually take him captive. Mufleh's story is a long way from the myth ISIS likes to propagate, that its followers are pious men and women drawn to the group's hardline interpretation of Islam. The reality in many cases is that ISIS' reputation for bloody violence is the only thing encouraging new recruits from within the many towns and villages the terror group has seized in recent months. This morning a terror expert described how ISIS grooms Western fighters in much the same way as paedophiles do with children. Fear: The men accused of being Islamic State fighters were interviewed in the basement of their prison in northern Syria by Holly Williams (left), a correspondent for CBS News . Suleiman Mohammed is accused of plotting to detonate a car bomb on behalf of the Islamic State terror group . Militant: ISIS grooms new recruits online in much the same way as paedophiles do with children . Professor Greg Barton, from Australia's Monash University's Global Terrorism Research Centre, told AAP that recruiters lure targets by making friends through social media, like many sexual predators. 'Somebody might strike up a friendship in an online chat forum and present themselves in a different fashion - to try to get them into their web... By the time they actually meet the people they're speaking with, they may be in too deep to know better.' While that approach may work with naive Western recruits, the reality is that for many of those already living under ISIS' bloody oppression, it is only the fear that the group's leadership will murder either them or their loved ones, that encourages militants to take up arms for the Islamic State. Islamic State militants fighting in Syria and Iraq have released a sickening video of a young woman being stoned to death by a group of men - including her own father. The shocking footage is understood to have been filmed in the city of Hama and shows a bearded cleric ranting at the woman in Arabic and accusing her adultery while she pleads for her life. The woman turns to her father and begs his forgiveness but he coldly rejects her, saying he would rather please God. He then turns to the men to give the signal for his daughter's murder to begin. Terror: The bearded ISIS militant orders the woman to be 'content and happy' that she is about to be stoned to death because, he says, her death has been ordered by God. Her father (left) stands next to the extremist . Minutes later, as the men rain rocks down upon the helpless woman, her father steps forward with a large stone and the video fades to black. It is believed he had been granted the barbaric 'honour' of being allowed end the life of the daughter he felt had betrayed both him and her religion. The sickening five-minute video emerged on ISIS-affiliated social media pages this morning. It is not clear when the footage was actually shot and has not been independently verified. The exact accusations against the woman remain sketchy, although the cleric who appears at the start of mobile phone-filmed clip accuses her of committing adultery.

Ms Kardashians says she feels 'heaps better' and has much more confidence after changing her name . It cost her just $98.80 to make her dream come true when she officially changed her name in 2010 and it has completely transformed her life. The reality TV fan is thrilled with her new name, telling Daily Mail Australia that she is ‘so proud to have the same name as a celebrity.’ ‘I feel heaps better! I love Kim Kardashian and wanted to have her name because she’s such a lovely lady and I just like the name Kimmi.’ The mother-of-five says that she feels like she and US glamour Kim Kardashian now ‘share a special connection’ after her name change. ‘She’s a mum and I’m a mum. I like everything that she’s into.

I tell them my name and the taxi won't come because they think it was a prank.’ ‘Once, I was applying for an online job based in America. The man said “I don’t believe that that’s your name. This is a joke.” ‘He wouldn’t believe me, no matter what I said.’ The Melbourne woman says she would like her own reality show but would be concerned about her five children's reactions to being surrounded by video cameras . Kimmi Kardashian jokes that she also likes to take selfies like her role model and namesake . The 47-year-old says that Kim Kardashian embodies everything that she wants for herself. ‘She’s just wonderful. She’s a famous actress, I love the way she acts and the way she dresses. ‘She looks like she’s a fun person to be around by the looks of her show. She’s amazing.’ Ms Kardashians, who is looking for a new job, admires Kim Kardashian's entrepreneurial skills. Her new name has boosted her confidence and given her a new lease on life. ‘I love the photoshoots she does, the shop where she sells clothes,' she said. I’ve always wanted to make a perfume like her and I hope to one day make my own exotic scent,’ Ms Kardashians explains. As a woman who loves to be made up and wear beautiful clothes, Ms Kardashians was ecstatic to be involved in a photo shoot recently, explaining that it 'made her feel like a million bucks.' 'I got my hair done, I got my make up done, it made me feel special and wanted. 'I did different poses and wore different clothes. I got to feel like Kim Kardashian. The Hampton Park resident would love to have her own reality television show like Ms Kardashian, but she also has her reservations, explaining ‘I don’t know how the kids would go, having all the cameras around.’ Her five children are 'very proud and happy for her' after her name change, including her youngest three daughters (left to right) Natasha, Chloe and Amanda . Ms Kardashians laments that she did not give her own children names starting with the same letter like the Kardashian family did . Ms Kardashians does have a history of being inspired by television, as she named her 22-year-old daughter Penny after a character in ‘Lost in Space’ and her daughter Chloe, 13, after a Home and Away character . Ms Kardashians laments that she did not give her own children names starting with the same letter like the Kardashian family did.

Ms Kardashians (right, pictured with her youngest daughter Amanda) says her children are very sweet and will call out 'Kimmi' just to see their mother turn around with a happy look on her face . ‘It’s a great ice breaker and starts a lot of fun conversations. I’m having fun with all those benefits of having the name Kimmi Kardashians.' Ms Kardashians would like to tell Kim Kardashian about her name change, but she ‘doesn’t know how to get in contact with her’.

"The parents of a young man with severe autism who has been chained to a hospital bed for 14 days claim that healthcare authorities have ignored their pleas for support. Bronwyn Pascoe's son James was diagnosed with autism at the age of two, and suffers from high levels of anxiety and trauma, which she said was caused by years of care givers repeatedly ignoring his needs. Despite persistent calls by Mrs Pascoe and her husband Allan to the Victorian Department of Human Services about the lack of support and appropriate care options, James was apprehended by police at his accommodation centre and taken to the Northern Hospital in Epping, where he has been restrained for 14 days. Scroll down for video . James Pascoe has severe autism and was apprehended by police at his accommodation centre after acting out and was taken to the Northern Hospital in Epping, where he has been restrained for 14 days . Mrs Pascoe's mother had been a role model for James and a care giver who he adored, but passed away from pancreatic cancer when James was 16. 'When my mum passed away in 2012 James started showing outbursts of behaviour, and wasn't coping. He withdrew and became depressed and became obsessed with the fact that people died,' Mrs Pascoe told Daily Mail Australia. 'He kept reliving losing her and was haunted by the fact that his baby sister had died at only a few weeks old, and this developed into real trauma,' she said. James's sister Jacinta died at only four and half weeks old, an event which still distresses him, and made the deaths of his grandparents more acute and created a fear of hospitals and death. After a long battle to develop in-home care that would meet James's growing needs, the Pascoe's were finally told that if he became aggressive that they would have to resort to calling the police. 'We didn't want to do that, we wanted to have help in our home that would mean we could work with him and provide therapy so he learnt how to deal with his anxiety and anger,' Mrs Pascoe said. After struggling to control James's outbursts and teach him how to deal with his emotions, James's behaviour continued to escalate and his parents made the heartbreaking decision to phone the police. James has severe autism and spent his 21st birthday shackled to a hospital bed despite his parent's desperate pleas to healthcare authorities who they say have failed him . James (centre) with his mother Bronwyn (left) and father Allan (right) say their son has deteriorated as a result of ignorance about his condition and a lack of support from the Victorian Department of Human Services . 'He couldn't even go in the ambulance to hospital because he was scared that he would die, everyone who had been taken away in an ambulance died,' Mrs Pascoe said. Since then, Mrs Pascoe said her son has been through a cycle of being shackled and sedated over the past two years, in and out of respite houses, care facilities, and the hospital, with no treatment plans for the grief and trauma he was experiencing from the bewildering experiences. Mrs Pascoe said that there was an incident where the family received a letter informing them they were removing him to a facility without consent, despite weeks of negotiations. 'When I went to visit him in the respite home he was all over me, really touchy-feely because he was alone there, all by himself, with no physical contact. The carers wouldn't talk to him or interact with him and he was deprived of sensory experiences,' she said. A spokesperson from the Department of Human Services said that it was not policy to leave a client in isolation, and that the Department had been working consistently towards finding a solution that was appropriate and were seeking to address James's needs. James's parents said they have exhausted themselves begging for funding to keep him at home to give him the support and therapy he needs with healthcare professionals who know his case and are familiar with him. 'The problem is the system has put him into a cycle of trauma- he'll feel safe and secure and then be sent back to square one,' Mrs Pascoe said. 'I'm sure if he had normal abilities they wouldn’t be able to treat him like that,' she said. 'Had someone worked with us we would never have gotten into cycle. This is bureaucracy gone mad, getting police to deal with our children instead of helping them through grief and loss,' said Mrs Pascoe . James's parents said they have exhausted themselves begging for funding to keep him at home to give him the support and therapy he needs . Mrs Pascoe said her son has been through a cycle of being shackled and sedated over the past two years, in and out of respite houses, care facilities, and the hospital with no treatment plans for the grief and trauma he was experiencing from the bewildering experiences . The Pascoe's believe that the lack of understanding about autism and the level of ignorance even within the Department of Human Services has resulted in her son living in a constant state of fear and anxiety. The depression and anger he exhibited only continued, exacerbated by a system which James's family claims refuses to act until their situation reaches a crisis point, and he is shackled and heavily sedated to the point of terror. 'I feel so powerless because we can't do anything, and it's heartbreaking that we cant have him home because we haven’t got the funding,' Mrs Pascoe said. 'Had someone worked with us we would never have gotten into cycle. This is bureaucracy gone mad, getting police to deal with our children instead of helping them through grief and loss is not the way to go,' she said. On November 21, James was taken to hospital after acting out at a centre in the city of Whittlesea. The Department of Human Services reportedly has other policies for dealing with such situations, and while calling the police was one option which might be used if needed, it was not the only one available. Other approaches which could be used such as dimming lights, talking in soft voices, and withdrawing from the room. James has spent the past fortnight strapped down in Northern Hospital, and his mother said he has been given heavy doses of drugs to prevent him from escaping. A spokesperson from the Department of Human Services said 'James was admitted to the Northern Hospital by his family. His family and a consulting physician are making decisions about his care while in hospital,' 'While several options for support have been offered for James’ long term care, these options have not so far been accepted by his family.' 'The department will continue to work with James and his family to make sure he gets appropriate and quality care.' James's baby sister died at only four and a half weeks old, an event which distresses him still . James's parents Bronwyn and Allan say that their son has high levels of anxiety and that hospitals scare him . 'He is a prisoner in that room, he isn't allowed cant go out because they can't risk it, and he doesn’t get to see daylight, he's maintained in one room,' Mrs Pascoe said. 'Prisoners actually get treated better, and why should he have less because he's an autistic child? He had no choice in the matter,' she said. 'He has a right to be safe and secure and not be labelled as a problem to society,' she said. Mrs Pascoe has launched a petition at Change.org pleading with Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews to provide adequate care for people with autism. The petition has been signed by more than 17,000 people who support the call for greater funding and for James's needs to be addressed. 'I didn't want to use James, but I had to tell his story and put it out there because it was the only way to reach to the community, so people know what has happened to people with autism,' she said. 'James needs a voice to show whats happened to him. If we don’t start getting it right we’ll have an epidemic,' 'People relinquish their kids because they get exhausted with the system crying for help. It's meant to protect the vulnerable instead of treating them like non-humans.'","Bronwyn and Allan Pascoe's son James was diagnosed with severe autism at the age of two but had manageable levels up until the age of 16 .

"Kim's bottom might have almost broken the internet, but Kylie Jenner's lips have also made their fair share of headlines in recent weeks. The youngest Keeping Up With The Kardashians star has been been repeatedly criticised for her pouty social media snaps, with many claiming that her full lips are the result of cosmetic surgery. But in an exclusive interview with FEMAIL, Kylie's make-up artist rubbishes reports that the 17-year-old's lips are fake and reveals that it's actually very simple to recreate her look. Scroll down for video . Perfect pout: Kylie Jenner, 17, has been showing her full lips on social media in recent weeks and now her make-up artist Rob Scheppy has revealed how he achieves the look . Sharing the two-product secret behind Kylie's perfect pout, Rob Scheppy said: 'I find it funny that so much attention is drawn to my work, but I like it. 'Kylie's lips are created using expertly applied lip liner and a little lip balm.' And it seems her sisters agree - Kim recently told MailOnline that she takes inspiration from her younger sister. She said: 'I live with Kylie so every time she's putting on her lashes or putting on her lip liner, I ask her for advice on how she does it so perfectly. She is so good at make-up.' Beauty tips: Kylie Jenner's makeup artists reveals that all it takes to create the star's lips is a bit of lip liner and some balm . Khloe agrees, adding: 'Sophia Loren is my icon but I also love my little sister Kylie and what she does with her make-up and her hair is really funky and cool.' 'I swear her make-up takes her fifteen minutes, she does it all the time and it doesn't take her long and it looks so natural. It doesn't look like she has piled it on.' Kylie Jenner was accused by fans of having plastic surgery to enhance her looks, which the youngster has slammed. The Australian edition of OK! Magazine alleged the reality star has had a nose job, lip fillers and Botox. But a representative for Miss Jenner told Mail Online: ‘That’s so ridiculous and not true.’ Get the look: Rob loves using MAC lip liners on Kylie and swears by Eyeko products, right, which Alexa Chung is the face of . Rob, who has been working with the family for years, is often described as the man who pioneered contouring, using Kim Kardashian as his muse. But despite the acclaim, Rob is extremely modest about the success of his work. He said: 'I'm not sure if that's true. If anything, I am just the messenger and that feels good. 'I am always trying new techniques, which I think is really important as it’s easy to stick to what you know with makeup - sometimes they work and sometimes they don't. 'I am happy when I make my clients feel good.' So how does he give the reality stars that famous Kardashian glow? One routine he has stuck to religiously when working with the girls is skin preparation, which he believes is 'essential for glowing skin'. He said: 'The girls take great care of themselves and that helps a lot. 'I typically start with a light moisturiser and then foundation and I use as little powder as possible, so the skin keeps that glow. Oh and a good highlighter always helps.' Part of the family: Rob travels the world with the sisters and often features in their social media snaps - Kylie even took him as her date to Kim and Kanye's pre-wedding dinner . Rob's number one beauty tip though, is that the natural look is always better. He said: 'Like all magic tricks you need the illusion for the trick to work but I can say that...less is more and more is less, more or less.' In terms of products, he loves using MAC lip liners on Kylie and also swears by Eyeko products, which Alexa Chung is the face of and has created her own range for. He said: 'I really love Eyeko mascaras, eyeliners, the brow liner and lash wardrobe. 'The mascaras are the best for creating a really full lash, and the liquid brow pen is so perfectly subtle and long-lasting. 'I love it for filling in any gaps and enhancing natural brows.'

Rob travels the world with the sisters and often features in their social media snaps - Kylie even took him as her date to Kim and Kanye's pre-wedding dinner.

"Next week’s FIFA congress in Sao Paulo looks increasingly problematic for president Sepp Blatter with the decision to award the 2018 World Cup to Russia now under attack as well as the Qatar fiasco. A global campaign calling for a boycott of World Cup sponsors Budweiser, Visa, Kia Motors and Sony is being led by United with Ukraine, a human rights organisation based in Canada opposing Russia’s annexation of the Crimean peninsula. A spokesman for UwU said: ‘We have this opportunity standing right in front of us to have FIFA strip Russia of its World Cup. I do not believe the sponsors want to align their brands with Vladimir Putin.’ Problems ahead: Sepp Blatter could face a problematic time at a conference in Sao Paulo . The anti-Russia protest is extremely well funded, as it is financed by Berkshire Hathaway, the holding company for the fabulously rich American financier Warren Buffett. Meanwhile, the Qatar controversy became yet more toxic with an Iranian TV website claiming that America’s spy agency, the NSA, and its British counterpart, GCHQ, were allegedly involved in the leak of FIFA emails and investigative reports to further destabilise the 2022 World Cup hosts.

Touching down: David Beckham arrives in Miami . Becks needs LeBron . David Beckham, who arrived in Miami on Friday night, is planning soon to list the key backers of his group’s proposal for a new waterside stadium for their Major League Soccer franchise next door to the Miami Heat basketball arena. And the major speculation in Miami is whether Beckham’s official cheerleaders will include Heat superstar LeBron James, whose late attack of cramp led to defeat by the San Antonio Spurs in the opening game of the NBA finals. James, Beckham’s close friend, has long been linked with joining his ownership group. And certainly LeBron’s patronage would greatly help reverse the negative publicity around the  stadium in a celebrity-obsessed city. Beckham, sure to be courtside for game three of the NBA finals in Miami next week, said: ‘If LeBron comes in that will be amazing because people love him in this city. He’s not just a great sportsman but a great man.’ BBC Sport consider the World Cup important enough to send an army of 272 personnel to Brazil — even including a specialist Twitter operative, who could more efficiently operate from Manchester.

"It is the disease that is now responsible for one in four deaths in the Western world. Now, what may be the oldest case of cancer has been discovered in a 4,500-year-old skeleton. Archaeologists say that a Siberian man succumbed to either lung or prostate cancer, as revealed by tell-tale marks on his bones. Earliest victim? What may be the oldest case of cancer has been discovered in a 4,500-year-old skeleton (pictured). Archaeologists say that a Siberian man succumbed to either lung or prostate cancer, as revealed by tell-tale marks on his bones . The early Bronze Age man's remains were exhumed from a small hunter-gatherer cemetery in the Cis-Baikal region of Siberia. ‘This represents one of the earliest cases of human cancer worldwide and the oldest case documented thus far from Northeast Asia,’ said Angela Lieverse, a bioarchaeologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Canada. Older skeletons believed to be between 5,000 and 6,000 years old have yielded similar discoveries, but cancers were unconfirmed or tumours were found to be benign. Analysing the Russian remains with Daniel Temple from George Mason University in Virginia and Vladimir Bazaliiskii with Irkutsk State University in Russia, Dr Lieverse discovered that the cancer had riddled the ancient man’s bones with from head to hip, including his upper arms and upper legs, and virtually all points between. As he lay dying, severe pain and fatigue would have been his constant companions, punctuated by periods of panic as he struggled to breathe, she said. The man's age, sex and lesions on his bones point to lung cancer ( a magnified human lung cancer cell is shown) or possible prostate cancer for his cause of death. Experts found the cancer had riddled the ancient man’s bones with from head to hip, including his upper arms and upper legs, and virtually all points between . The man’s community buried him in a foetal position in a circular pit after he died, according to the research published in the journal, Plos One. The cancer victim was buried with an ornamental bone and a bone spoon, intricately carved with a winding serpent handle. Ancient skeletons bearing the scars of cancer are rare, leading some people to believe that the disease is a recent phenomenon caused by our modern lifestyles. However, this find provides evidence that refutes this hypothesis. Dr Lieverse suspects that taking into account variables such as longer life expectancies, cancer may have been considerably more common in ancient times than is generally presumed. ‘As we become more familiar with what metastatic carcinoma looks like in the skeleton, the number of cases identified by bioarchaeological research is likely to increase,’ she said. He is thought to have been between 35 and 40 years old when he died. This burial differed from most men’s of the period, who were typically laid to rest on their backs with fishing or hunting gear. The researchers performed a battery of tests on the man, as if he had died recently and ruled out the possibility that he had died from tuberculosis or fungal diseases. They said that the most likely culprit was metastatic carcinoma – cancer that starts in one part of the body and spreads. ‘It’s clear the disease had progressed considerably, metastasising far beyond its original location in the body and contributing to his death,' Dr Lieverse said. ‘His age and sex and the lesions on his bones point to lung cancer or possibly prostate cancer.’ The early Bronze Age man's remains were exhumed from a small hunter-gatherer cemetery near Lake Baikal (shown on the map) in the Cis-Baikal region of Siberia . Ancient skeletons bearing the scars of cancer are rare, leading some people to believe that the disease is a recent phenomenon caused by our modern lifestyles. The Bronze Age man lived in a mountainous region with freshwater lakes and would have eaten a healthy diet of fish, game and fresh seasonal plants. However, this find provides evidence that refutes this hypothesis. Dr Lieverse suspects that taking into account variables such as longer life expectancies, cancer may have been considerably more common in ancient times than is generally presumed. ‘As we become more familiar with what metastatic carcinoma looks like in the skeleton, the number of cases identified by bioarchaeological research is likely to increase,’ she said. ‘A related example is scurvy. Once we knew what scurvy does to the skeleton and became familiar with the signs, identification of the disease increased.","Siberian Bronze Age man succumbed to either lung or prostate cancer .

"We're more used to seeing him scaling cliff faces dressed in a tuxedo or emerging half-naked from the sea in just a pair of pale blue trunks. But Daniel Craig left the Twittersphere more than just a little shaken and stirred when he turned up to launch of the new James Bond film - wearing a 'Christmas' knitted jumper. The usually-stylish actor donned the navy blue crew-neck as he marked the start of the production of Spectre, the  24th installment of the 007 film empire. Scroll down for video . Daniel Craig caused a stir yesterday when he turned up to the Spectre launch wearing a blue knitted jumper . The usually-stylish actor, pictured with Lea Sedoux and Monica Belluci, paired the 'grandad' jumper with grey slacks and a white shirt - much to the dismay of his fans . And, if that wasn't enough, the actor decided to pair the 'sensible' jumper with grey trousers, a white shirt and a plain pair of black shoes - setting pulses racing for all the wrong reasons. Despite the excitement surrounding the much-anticipated event, it wasn't long before the questionable ensemble was the talk of the launch, sending Twitter into meltdown. Mark Machado swiftly announced: 'Daniel Craig has officially opened Christmas jumper season'. After that, there were a flurry of concerned tweets about Craig's new look. One user, Montynero, was baffled that the actor had rocked up to the event 'in a Dad jumper looking like a drunk supply teacher'. While Shirley Lemon wrote: 'Love James Bond. Love Daniel Craig. Love the new title: Spectre. But don't want to see Bond in his sensible jumper.' Another user explained that the cold weather was 'no excuse' for the knitwear, writing: 'I know it's a bit chilly today but that's no escuse for Daniel Craig to wear such a grandad jumper.' It wasn't long before a spoof image of Daniel Craig sporting a Christmas jumper was sweeping the internet . Bond fans took to Twitter to express their dismay at Mr Craig's choice of 'grandad' jumper . And Dan Cooper described the look as similar to 'an accountant at a fancy dress ball'. As one Twitter user pointed out, the jumper 'wasn't even a V-neck'. The jumper caused such a stir that one Photoshop-savvy user took it upon themselves to superimpose a reindeer onto Craig's top, in a spoof 'Christmas jumper' image which swept the internet. But for others, the outfit was a welcome change from the swanky suits for which James Bond is well-known. Kathy Keown tweeted that the jumper gave her 'hope that Spectre's costuming aesthetic will be mainly knitwear'. And Ismail Mulla thought Craig still looked the part, stating that he 'could make a tartan apron look cool'. The new film features a stellar line-up and is being directed by Sam Mendes (fourth from left) Another user Daniel Blythe took comfort from the fact that, for once in his life, he was 'as stylish as James Bond'. The title of the new film, directed by Brit movie maker Sam Mendes, revolves around the Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism and Revenge and Extortion. Spectre is led by iconic evil genius Ernst Blofeld, the super-villain from the Dr No and Thunderball movies. But some 007 fans were rather taken by the actor's outfit, with several saying that he pulled it off in usual Daniel Craig style . The film, which is due for general release on 6 November 2015, will feature Oscar-winning star Christoph Waltz, Moriarty actor Andrew Scott, Italian star Monica Bellucci and French actress Lea Seydoux alongside Craig. It has taken its title from the shadowy terrorist organisation created by Bond author Ian Fleming which first appeared in his novel Thunderball. Locations for the new film will include London, Mexico City, Rome, Morocco's Tangier and Erfoud, as well as Solden in Austria, which promises to see Bond returning to the ski slopes. 'All of them are amazing places. I'm very excited to be going to these locations over seven months, which is how long we'll be shooting,' said Mendes. Announcing the production, film-makers said of the plot: 'A cryptic message from Bond's past sends him on a trail to uncover a sinister organisation. 'While M battles political forces to keep the secret service alive, Bond peels back the layers of deceit to reveal the terrible truth behind Spectre.'","Daniel Craig attended launch dressed in navy crew-neck knitted jumper .

"Sophie Jones, 31, believes her smoking habit played a part in the death of her son Korey, who was stillborn . A pregnant mother who smoked more than 25 cigarettes a day while pregnant believes her addiction claimed the life of her baby son. Sophie Jones gave birth to a stillborn son, Korey, in 2011. The mother-of-five said she is racked with guilt, believing her smoking played a part in the death of her son. Her heartache at losing Korey was compounded by the fact her son Frankie died when he was four days old, from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, in 2006. Despite this, she has smoked during every pregnancy except this one. She claims she was unaware of the dangers her habit posed to her unborn babies. 'It is absolutely devastating to lose two children as you never expect that to happen,' she said. 'When I go to tidy up their graves I think I should be tidying their bedrooms not their gravesides. 'I think about them both everyday, but it's particularly sad at this time of year because on Christmas Day I think there should be two more piles of presents.' Mrs Jones, 31, was told she suffered a stillbirth because of damage caused to her placenta. She said she believes the damage was the result of her smoking. The housewife, who is 20 weeks pregnant with her sixth child, has quit her habit to protect her unborn daughter. She said: 'I've experienced the worst possible heartache that no parent should have to go through. 'Losing my baby boy Korey as a stillbirth is one of my biggest regrets and continues to haunt me to this day. 'I never fully understood the risks of smoking while pregnant. I just thought it led to a smaller baby. 'How wrong I was. I cut down when I fell pregnant, but obviously that wasn't enough to save my baby.' Mrs Jones's son Frankie died four days after he was born in 2006 of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). While the 31-year-old does not know if his death was caused by her smoking, recent research by Durham University revealed the risk of SIDS increases if a parent smokes. 'I've always dreamed of a big family, so when I fell pregnant this time I was determined to quit for good,' said Mrs Jones, who is married to Alix, 27, a support worker. 'I visited Northumberland Stop Smoking Service where the advisers were just the best. 'They gave me so much knowledge and support that I can't thank them enough for what they've done. 'When they sat me down to explain how smoking could be depriving my unborn baby of oxygen I felt sick. Scroll down for video . The mother-of-five, who is 20 weeks pregnant with a baby girl, has given up smoking to protect her unborn daughter. She said she was not aware of the dangers her addiction posed to her baby son, thinking smoking only resulted in a smaller baby. She urged other mothers-to-be to quit their habit to protect their babies . Every cigarette contains more than 4,000 chemicals, which can cause serious harm to an unborn baby. Cigarettes can restrict the essential oxygen supply to a baby, forcing their heart to beat harder every time their mother smokes. Stopping smoking will immediately benefit both the mother-to-be and their unborn baby. Harmful gases, including carbon monoxide, will start to clear from the mother's body. Smoking during pregnancy can aggravate the symptoms of morning sickness and increase the risk of stillbirth. Mothers who quit smoking will cope better with birth and reduce the chances of their baby being born prematurely. Babies born to smoking mothers are also on average 8oz (200g) lighter than other babies, leaving them more prone to infection. Smoking during pregnancy also raises the risk of sudden infant death syndrome. Quitting will also benefit a child's health later in life. Children with parents who smoke are more prone to asthma and other serious illnesses. A study published in the British Medical Journal earlier this year warned that passive smoking also increases the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, and ectopic pregnancy. The more women are exposed to second hand smoke, the greater the risks. They study found younger and better educated women were less likely to miscarry or have birth complications while women of black and minority ethnic backgrounds, and those who were overweight, were more likely to do so. Compared to non-smokers, those who smoked during their reproductive years were 16 per cent more likely to miscarry, 44 per cent more likely to have a stillborn child, and 43 per cent more likely to have an ectopic pregnancy. 'To learn smoking could be damaging me and my unborn baby in this way was gutting. I made my mind up about quitting there and then. 'I've now been quit for four months and I've never felt better. I no longer suffer from breathlessness and the money I've saved from not buying cigarettes has bought a new cot for the baby. 'All of my children are so proud of me for not smoking and tell me all the time how happy they are that I don't smell. 'I'd encourage any mums-to-be who smoke to think about the risks to your baby and get support to quit. Don't wait to suffer like I did.' Smoking is one of the biggest risks to the health of unborn babies, depriving them of vital oxygen and cutting off the supply of nutrients they need to grow properly. It is estimated that 360 young lives are lost each year in the North East due to smoking-related miscarriages, with between 3,000 and 5,000 lost nationally. As well as being a major cause of stillbirth and premature birth, the poisons found in tobacco smoke can also increase the risk of cot death, birth defects and lead to a child developing behavioural problems in their early years. Connie Reardon, stop smoking pregnancy specialist at Northumberland Stop Smoking Service, run by Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'We are incredibly grateful for Sophie for being brave enough to share such an agonizing story in the hope more expectant and future mothers and their families can understand the harm that smoking can cause to your unborn baby. 'We know quitting is not easy and we can give the support to help expectant mothers to do it. 'There's now more proof than ever that smoking is dangerous – both for your unborn baby and you. 'And even if you've smoked through your pregnancy so far, it's not too late to stop as the benefits kick in straight away. 'We are not here to judge, we just want to help ladies to decide how to quit on their terms. 'We know you are four times more likely to quit with our support and nicotine replacement therapy is available free of charge for pregnant smokers.'","Sophie Jones smoked 25 cigarettes a day during her pregnancies .

"From balloon-popping lasers to Wolverine-style claws, there are numerous concept and protoype weapons designed by wannabe superhero inventors. But, a magician has not only created a wristband that turns the wearer into Pyro from the Marvel comics, he is selling it for $174 (£111) online. Named after the comic book mutant, the Pyro band features four chambers that fires four fireballs, and it can be controlled from the wrist or remotely. Scroll down for video . Pyro (pictured) was designed by New Hampshire magician Adam Wilber. It features four separate chambers for four multiple shots and can be controlled either from the wrist or remotely . Its inventor, Adam Wilber explained: ‘Fire. Since the dawn of time it has been the reward at the end of man's quest. Both creator and destroyer, it has historically been the element hardest to control. ‘Until now. Your quest is over. The power of fire in the palm of your hand. That's the power of Pyro.' It is available from the Ellusionist site, and ships internationally. The band resembles a watch and can be concealed under a sleeve. Pressing a button on the device shoots the fireballs, or a remote control can be used to fire them from a distance of up to 30ft (nine metres) away. The band resembles a watch and can be concealed under a sleeve (pictured left). It uses so-called Flash Cotton, or Flash Paper that fits inside the barrels. A heater coil then ignites the material when the button is pressed, forcing the flame to fire from the chambers . The device is named after Marvel comic book character Pyro, played by Adam Burton in the X-Men franchise (pictured). In the series, Pyro is a so-called Class 4 mutant that can create and control fire . If smartwatches from the likes of Apple and Motorola don't appeal to you, a German inventor has built a powerful alternative. Dubbed Bond Inspired LaserWatch, the timepiece was designed at home by a hobbyist using a metal case, screws, and a built-in laser pointer. The designer recently demonstrated the power of the laser by popping balloons and lighting matches from around 3ft (one metre) away. It is the brainchild of Wuppertal-based Patrick Priebe. It uses so-called Flash Cotton, or Flash Paper that fits inside the barrels. A heater coil then ignites the material when the button is pressed, forcing the flame to fire from the chambers. The pack contains enough of this material for up to 50 uses. Refills then start at $8 (£4). Flash material is used by magicians to create fast burning flames for tricks. Mr Wilber describes Pryo as a ‘badass professional device’, and as a result only over 18s are allowed to purchase or use the fire shooter. The site ships internationally, but a disclaimer stresses that the device ‘contains dangerous elements’ that are governed by the laws of the country in which is it bought. Buyers have to agree to the terms and conditions, and watch an instructional safety video by Adam Wilber, before buying the device. It is recommended, and has been built for, magicians. ‘In the lead up to release we sent a number of Pyro units out to some of the most creative up-and-comers in the industry to put the unit through its paces,’ explained Ellusionist. ‘Every single person that received Pyrocalled us up and raved about it.

"Two Bronx, New York men were arrested Friday transporting $11million worth of heroin in what is being described as the biggest drug bust of the year. The arrests of Edualin Tapia and Guillermo Esteban Margarin come at the end of the a six-month investigation. Federal authorities had been tailing the two associates for months and on Thursday, saw them at a suspected 'heroin mill' in the Bronx where the drug is processed and packaged. Haul: Federal authorities seized more than 50 pounds of heroin in the largest drug bust of 2014 so far . The next day, they followed the two men as they drove to Hartford, Connecticut for a delivery - the drugs in plain view in open boxes in the back of the car. The two men were finally arrested when authorities caught them trying to flush the drugs down a sink at a Harford home. Authorities recovered 53 pounds of heroin, worth some $11million on the street. Additional search also uncovered $85,000 in cash, 10 kilos of cocaine, 200 'Molly' pills, two assault rifles and a hand gun. Seized: The search Friday also uncovered $85,000 in cash, 10 kilos of cocaine, 200 'Molly' pills, two assault rifles and a hand gun . 'These arrests cut a pipeline moving huge amounts of heroin from New York City to the Northeast,' said Special Narcotics Prosecutor Bridget Brennan. 'Suppressing the availability of heroin, which is destroying an increasing number of lives, is a top priority.' In his own statement, NYPD Commissioner Bill Brattan thanked the investigators and prosecutors on the case for bringing the massive drug operation to an end. Tapia and Margarin are currently being held in Connecticut jail on charges of criminal possession of a controlled substance and conspiracy. They are waiting extradition back to New York.","Edualin Tapia and Guillermo Esteban Margarin of Bronx, New York were arrested Friday transporting 53 pounds of heroin to Connecticut .

"She subtly slammed Bill Cosby over his history of rape allegations on an episode of 30 Rock back in 2009. But this was not the first time Tina Fey took on the comedian, as she called him out for allegedly drugging and molesting a woman during a Saturday Night Live segment nine years ago. The actress co-anchored 'Weekend Update' with Amy Poehler and reported that Cosby can't be held responsible  as he was suffering from 'the brain damage', trying out her best impression. Scroll down for video . Tina Fey called out Bill Cosby for allegedly drugging and molesting a woman during a Saturday Night Live segment nine years ago . They then joked that resident Cosby impersonator Kenan Thompson was too scared to comment because he wanted to continue to work in show business. The joke was aired the week that Tamara Green went on NBC's Today Show to accuse Cosby of rape. During the mock news report, Ms Fey said: 'A California lawyer alleged Wednesday that thirty years ago, Bill Cosby drugged her and tried to molest her, and after she fought back, he dropped two hundred-dollar bills on a table and fled. 'Cosby says he can't be held responsible for his actions, since at the time he was suffering from, ""the brain damage"".' The actress co-anchored 'Weekend Update' with Amy Poehler and reported that Cosby can't be held responsible as he was suffering from 'the brain damage', trying out her best impression . When Ms Poehler asked if Mr Thompson would be coming out as Cosby to defend himself, Ms Fey continued her impression, saying, 'No, Kenan is not coming out because of the 'Fat Albert,' and the money, and the sequels.' 'Of course he can't talk about the boobies, and the groping, and the pudding pops,' Ms Poehler added. When Mr Thompson did come on the set, as himself, he said, 'Wow, thanks for that. Great job, you guys. I didn't say any of that, because Kenan Thompson loves to work, OK? Peace.' Four years later, Emmy Award-winning show 30 Rock, which is produced by Ms Fey and  Lorne Michaels, made a scathing reference to Cosby's alleged history of assaulting women. In a clip from season three 'The Bubble', Alec Baldwin's NBC executive character Jack Donaghy tries to get actor Tracy Jordan, played by Tracy Morgan, to come back to work at fictional television show TGS. He does this by hiring a Cosby impersonator to speak to the actor over the phone. But the plan backfires when Jordan hears Cosby's voice, and reveals he has some bad family history with the The Cosby Show star. The comedian used to be known as a moral pillar, an image he crafted through  years of playing an upright dad on The Cosby Show. That's changed now  20 women have come forward to accuse him of rape . Tina Fey: A California lawyer alleged Wednesday that thirty years ago, Bill Cosby drugged her and tried to molest her, and after she fought back, he dropped two hundred-dollar bills on a table and fled. Cosby says he can't be held responsible for his actions, since at the time he was suffering from, (imitating Bill Cosby) 'the brain damage'. Amy Poehler: That's funny. Is Kenan coming out to imitate Bill Cosby now? Tina Fey: (still as Bill Cosby) No, Kenan is not coming out because of the 'Fat Albert,' and the money, and the sequels! Amy Poehler: (also as Bill Cosby) Of course he can't talk about the boobies, and the groping, and the pudding pops. Tina Fey: Because it would upset Mr. Cosby, and his wife, Camiiillle. (Kenan Thompson walks in and stands behind Tina and Amy) Kenan Thompson: Wow, thanks for that. Great job, you guys. I didn't say any of that, because Kenan Thompson loves to work, OK? Peace. (walks off; some applause) Tina Fey: Wow, Kenan Thompson loves to work, everybody. Amy Poehler: Loves to work? Who doesn't? 'Bill Cosby, you got a lotta nerve gettin' on the phone wit' me after what you did to my Aunt Paulette.' Jordan yells down the line. 'I think you're confusing me with someone else,' the baffled impersonator replies. '1971. Cincinnati. She was a cocktail waitress with the droopy eye!' Jordan responds. The impersonator finds himself at a lack of words, saying: 'I'm the guy… with the pudding…' Comedian Hannibal Buress has been widely credited with the resurfacing rape allegations made against Cosby in a stand-up routine that went viral in October this year. He unleashed a violent tirade against the 77-year-old stand-up, calling him a 'rapist' and a sanctimonious hypocrite during a performance. Not a Cosby fan: Alec Baldwin's character's plan to get Tracy Jordan (played by Tracy Morgan, right) back to work backfires when Jordan reveals an aunt's traumatizing run-in with Cosby in 1971 . Mr Burress has history with Ms Fey as he spent a stretch back in 2010 as a writer on 30 Rock. It is not surprising that Fey knew about the rape allegations as she grew up in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania near Temple University, where they first became public. A former university employee Andrea Constand accused the star of fondling her in 2004. The case was ultimately thrown out a little over a year later, since authorities said they didn't have enough evidence to charge Cosby. Instead, Ms Constand filed a civil suit in March of that year, and found 13 other women willing to testify as witnesses showing Cosby's pattern of disturbing behavior. The suit was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount in November 2006. Ms Fey has not commented on the scandal.","Tina Fey called out Bill Cosby over rape allegations on Saturday Night Live .

"MP Anne Milton (pictured) is a fervent anti-obesity campaigner . Tory MP Anne Milton complained about being ‘squashed’ by a ‘large-bottomed man’ sitting next to her on the train yesterday. The former public health minister, who has campaigned against obesity, urged overweight commuters to slim down to ensure they can fit into the seats properly. Mrs Milton managed to get a seat on the crowded 7.34am train to London yesterday. The Guildford MP tweeted: ‘Seats free on 7.34 but in the middle seat of three. Small-bottomed man to my left but a very large-bottomed man to my right, who is asleep with his arms crossed on his ample stomach, which makes that squashed feeling seem so much worse somehow.’ When she was a public health minister from 2010 to 2012 she controversially suggested that GPs should tell people they are fat rather than obese to help them lose weight. Yesterday, Mrs Milton said the overweight commuter ‘roused from his slumber’ as the train was waiting outside Waterloo station. She added: ‘The man, his bottom and stomach have all now woken up and are slowly coming to life – whilst my bottom is now free.’ Afterwards, Mrs Milton told the Evening Standard newspaper: ‘If you are going to sit on one of those seats for three people, you need to take up one third of the seat. 'If your bottom is bigger than a third then you need to reduce its size.’ However, some Twitter users were unimpressed. One said: ‘Public transport is a nightmare, all know that. “HELP I’m sitting next to a fat person!” tweets only make it more uncomfortable?’ Another tweeted: ‘This is not the forum to vent such issues. As an MP you should have a little more decorum.’ And another post read: ‘Good to see our elected representatives treating people with such contempt.’ It was a morning of drama for Mrs Milton as she had been knocked off her bicycle on the way to the station. She was left shaken but unhurt after being involved in a collision with a van. And she said she was only saved from injury by the frame of her bicycle, which was damaged. Mrs Milton said: ‘It was one of those things where we both started moving away from a junction and he [the driver] didn’t see me. He stopped and he was very nice. I’m fully recovered and had no injury. I was shaken. I wanted to weep, so I started a Twitter storm about big bottoms.’","MP Anne Milton urges commuters to slim down in order to fit into seats .

"A Sainsbury's branch emptied its kosher food shelf after the manager feared anti-Israeli protesters outside would attack it, the supermarket giant has said. Meats, cheeses and sauces were removed from a Sainsbury's Local branch in Holborn, central London, as it was picketed by demonstrators who were calling on the grocer to boycott Israeli goods. The incident yesterday afternoon happened on the same day anti-Israeli activists 'wreaked havoc' at a Birmingham branch of Tesco when a demonstration got out of hand. Actor Colin Appleby took a photo of the empty shelf, prompting uproar online as hundreds condemned the grocer for appearing to succumb to the demands of the protesters. People also pointed out that many of the goods were not from Israel and instead came from nations including Britain and Poland. Scroll down for video . Anger: Kosher goods were removed yesterday from a Sainsbury's Local in Holborn, central London, allegedly over fears that protesters would damage them. But a passer-by claimed staff said: 'We support Free Gaza' Mr Appleby wrote that a staff member defended the decision by stating: 'We support Free Gaza'. When he then pointed out the distinction between Israeli and kosher goods, staff 'walked away', he wrote. The move yesterday sparked online accusations of anti-Semitism by the grocer – despite the Sainsbury family’s well-documented Jewish ancestry dating back as far as the 19th century. Sainsbury's insisted the decision was taken in case protesters hurled food from the shelves, which would then have to be thrown away. But Facebook user Gavin Platman made a formal complaint about the incident, which happened half a mile from the company's headquarters at London's Holborn Circus. He wrote to Sainsbury's: 'I presume you are aware that Kosher food is produced in countries other than Israel? You are therefore not making a political statement against Israel but instead are targeting a group based on race - i.e. Jews. Before and after: Theatre actor Colin Appleby visited the store when the goods were removed yesterday (left) before returning today (right), assuring other internet users that a staff member had been 'suitably chastised' Controversy: The incident yesterday happened at this Sainsbury's Local branch in Holborn, central London. A spokesman insisted it was 'not company policy at all' and had only been done to stop food being damaged . 'As a Jew I find this deeply offensive. Naturally I am against the death of innocent children in Gaza so why are you persecuting me by denying me the right to buy Kosher food? 'I presume you are also removing Halal food in protest against the Islamic State slaughtering Yazidis. Clearly not - therefore you have blurred the line between political statement and hate crime.' The incident at the Sainbury's branch comes in the context of a rise in anti-Semitic attacks. Last month Britain saw the second-most anti-Semitic incidents in any month since records began in 1984, according to a Jewish community organisation. The Community Security Trust recorded 200 incidents in July, suggesting a huge increase since the Gaza conflict began on July 8. The first six months of 2014 saw 304 anti-Semitic incidents, a 36 per cent rise on the same period last year, the Trust said. The government's communities minister Stephen Williams met the Trust's directors on Wednesday to discuss the rise. He said: 'It is more important than ever that in the face of the deeply upsetting events taking place in Gaza, Israel, Syria and Iraq that Britain’s many diverse communities stand united in supporting our shared British values of understanding and mutual respect.' Former Tory MP Louise Mensch also waded into the row, writing on Twitter: 'Dear @Sainsburys kosher is JEWISH food. Israel is a COUNTRY. How DARE YOU equate Jews' food to ISRAEL, how dare you #EverydayAntisemitism'. Pro-Palestinian protesters in Britain have long urged supporters to boycott Israeli goods, though not kosher goods, to send a message to Israel over its blockade of Gaza. The incident yesterday happened on the same day as demonstrators ‘wreaked havoc’ in a Tesco store after a protest against its stocking of Israeli food got out of hand. Protesters accused of hurling produce and attacking police at the supermarket in Hodge Hill, Birmingham,  are being hunted by officers. It is understood similar protests at Israeli military action in Gaza have taken place outside Tesco stores in Rochdale and Sale in Greater Manchester, Blackburn and Luton. A march involving 1,500 people in Cardiff last month led to criticism of the police after footage emerged of violence erupting. Tesco sells fruit, peppers, potatoes and herbs from Israel, along with branded goods. A spokesman said: ‘We do this in line with the Government position on trade with Israel, and we mark all products clearly with the country of origin, so customers can make informed choices about what to buy.’ The protest outside the Holborn Sainsbury's was thought to have been a smaller demonstration, not one of the huge marches which have taken place in London since the Gaza conflict began on July 8. The Stop The War coalition organised a protest in central London yesterday but it marched through a different part of the city, from the Egyptian embassy in Mayfair to Downing Street. Fury: Former Tory MP Louise Mensch waded into the row, saying to remove the food was discrimination . Debate: She called anti-Israeli protesters 'racist b*******' and said the supermarket should not have moved food . Protest: Ms Mensch used the hashtag #EverydayAntisemitism to criticise the branch manager's decision . Mr Appleby returned to the branch this evening and found the kosher food shelf had been fully reinstated, adding: 'Sainsbury's assure me the staff member has been suitably chastised.' The firm admitted the kosher food was removed but challenged Mr Appleby's version of events. A Sainsbury's spokesman told MailOnline there was 'no evidence' that a staff member had made the 'Free Gaza' comment and instead the decision was taken to stop protesters damaging the food. The spokesman added: 'It was the manager's decision there and then - not company policy at all. We are a non-political organisation and we're not coming down on either side of the argument. 'We have had similar demonstrations at stores where people have gone in and removed goods, though no great damage was done. 'A decision was taken by a store manager faced with a challenging situation outside the store'. Anger: The incident happened yesterday as police officers were allegedly attacked when an anti-Israeli protest at this branch of Tesco in Hodge Hill, Birmingham, got out of hand. Stock was thrown around the store . Heavy police presence: Several officers were pictured outside the Birmingham Tesco during the demonstration . She confirmed the protest had been specifically against the Holborn Sainsbury's, but was unable to say how large it was. It was not believed to be targeted at the giant's nearby headquarters. Sainsbury's added in a statement: 'The decision was taken to move these products to chilled storage elsewhere in the store for a short period on Saturday as a precautionary measure during an ongoing demonstration close to the store. 'They were returned to shelf as soon as was practically possible. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.' There was still no firm peace deal as the clock ticked towards a five-day ceasefire expiring in Gaza tomorrow at midnight (9pm GMT). Officials said tonight that Hamas was still opposed to the latest proposal but other Palestinian factions, including delegates representing President Mahmoud Abbas, were inclined to accept. Health officials say 1,980 Palestinians, most of them civilians, have been killed in the conflict. Some 67 Israelis have also been killed, 64 of them soldiers. Hamas officials said they were holding out in the hope of winning more concessions in the talks, which have been mediated by Egypt. A member of the Palestinian delegation said tonight the gaps between the sides were still significant and that it was far from certain whether a deal could be reached. 'We are less optimistic than we were earlier,' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to discuss the talks with the media. Hamas is demanding an end to the Israeli-Egyptian blockade on Gaza which has existed in its current form since 2007. The blockade, which Israel says is needed to prevent arms smuggling, has ground Gaza's economy to a standstill by restricting imports, limiting the movement of people in and out of the territory and blocking virtually all exports.","Products removed from shelves at Sainsbury's in Holborn, central London .

"Andreas Robbins, 25, left a suicide note saying he was going to jump off the George Washington Bridge - and hasn't been seen since . A father was left speechless after police told him they are 'too busy' dealing with Eric Garner protests to search for his suicidal son. Andreas Robbins, 25, from Stuyvesant, New York, left a suicide note saying he was going to jump off the George Washington Bridge on Monday night - and hasn't been seen since. His father Columbia University Professor Bruce Robbins said the NYPD was initially helpful, but now officers are busy dealing with thousands of protesters disrupting traffic and staging 'die-ins'. 'I was kind of speechless,' said Mr Robbins. 'A detective basically said, 'There's no one out to take your case because everyone is out there dealing with the consequences of the Eric Garner case'.' The protests kicked off on Wednesday, after a grand jury decided not to press charges against a white police officer for his role in Eric Garner's death last July. Daniel Pantaleo, 29, was filmed placing the 43-year-old father in a chokehold in the street and ignoring his cries that he could not breathe. Garner later died in hospital. Police have arrested more than 80 people involved in the demonstration which saw protesters carrying coffins across the Brooklyn Bridge. But officers say they have been 'working diligently' to find Mr Robbins as they sent out harbour and aviation units as well as canvassing around his neighbourhood. The 25-year-old was caught on surveillance footage leaving his apartment at 7.45pm on Monday, without his phone or bank card. His father learned about the suicide note on Monday evening after the 25-year-old's  girlfriend notified the police. 'The note said that he wanted his savings to be given to an organisation that fights depression and fight suicide and that he wanted his ashes strewn in the Mediterranean, which is where his mother is from,' said Mr Robbins. He  rushed out to the George Washington Bridge on Monday evening but failed to find his son there. The protests kicked off on Wednesday, after a jury decided not to press charges against a white police officer for his role in Eric Garner's death last July . Mr Robbins is described as 6ft 1inch tall and thin, weighing 200 pounds, with brown eyes and black hair . 'We just want a sign that he is okay,' Mr Robbins said. 'He should do whatever he wants, go wherever he wants, whatever he needs to do, but we just want to know that he's okay.' He is described as 6ft 1inch tall and thin, weighing 200 pounds, with brown eyes and black hair. Mr Robbins also has a prominent birthmark on the right side of his nose and tattoos on both shoulders and his right wrist. His family said he may be wearing a grey herringbone dresscoat and a scarf. He is also said to be a generous person who, 'would stop for an hour and talk to a homeless person at 1 a.m. in the morning'. Anyone with information is asked to call the NYPD’s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 800-577-TIPS or visit http://www.nypdcrimestoppers.com. His parents have also requested that anyone with information contact them at (212) 431-5872 or (917) 318-9707.

"The NFL's first openly gay player, Michael Sam, has been named Man of the Year by men's magazine GQ, and celebrated the accolade by planting a kiss on his partner Vito Cammisano. Sam, who was drafted into the St Louis Rams earlier this year, took home the award at a ceremony at West Hollywood's Chateau Marmont last night. Other stars in contention for the prize were Chris Pratt, Steve Carell, Dave Chappelle, Ansel Elgort and Shailene Woodley. Scroll down for video . Sealed with a kiss: NFL player Michael Sam kisses his boyfriend Vito Cammisano after being named GQ Man of the Year 2014 in West Hollywood last night . Happy couple: Sam was nominated for the award along with Chris Pratt, Steve Carell, Dave Chappelle, Ansel Elgort and Shailene Woodley and featured on the cover of GQ magazine in December . Cut: Sam was initially selected to play for the St Louis Rams, left, before being cut; he was then named in a Dallas Cowboys practice squad, right, but was then cut from the team . The athlete won the award despite having not yet played an on-season game in the NFL. He was cut from the Rams squad in August, but was later picked for a Dallas Cowboys practice team, only to be dropped again in October. When asked by TMZ why he thought he was not on the roster of an NFL team, Sam said; 'I think I was the SEC Defensive Player of the Year last year ... so I don't think it had to do with talent.' And while they took that to mean Sam was saying he was cut because he was gay, he quickly clarified his statement on Twitter. He wrote: 'Despite what headlines you may read, I’ve never said and have never believed that I am being kept out of the league. 'I know I have talent to play in the NFL and I look forward to getting an opportunity once again to prove that I can help a team win.' Nominees: Sam, middle, is pictured with, from left, actor Chris Pratt, comedian Dave Chappelle, actor Ansel Elgort and actress Shailene Woodley at the Chateau Marmont . So in Love: Sam has been very public about his relationship with his boyfriend Cammisano, right . Clearing the air: Sam later clarified his statement to TMZ on Twitter . Reaffirming: He repeated that he knew he had the talent, but has never believed his sexuality is why he was cut or not playing . Superstar: Sam was named one of GQ's Men of the Year . Football or not, Sam's career has been taking off since he graduated from University of Missouri, with the  24-year-old becoming perhaps the most famous openly gay professional athlete. And if the NFL doesn't work out he does have a big fan in Mötley Crüe front man Vince Neil, who has been very vocal about wanting him for he new Las Vegas Arena Football League team.","Michael Sam made history as the the first openly gay player in the NFL .

"The NYPD police officer who shot an unarmed man in a Brooklyn housing development texted his union representative as his victim lay dying, it has been claimed. After Peter Liang shot Akai Gurley on November 20, he and his partner Shaun Landau were in communication for more than six and a half minutes. During this time Liang's superior officer and an emergency operator who had fielded the 911 call about the shooting, tried in vain to reach the rookie policemen. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: The officer who killed young father Akai Gurley (above) in Brooklyn told his partner 'I think I'm going to get fired' seconds after the fatal shooting . Accident: Officer Peter Liang claims he was holding a flashlight and had his gun drawn when he accidentally fired, striking Gurley in the chest while the young man was in a darkened stairwell (above) Scene of the crime: It all happened at the Louis Pink Houses (above) in the East New York section of Brooklyn . A source told the New York Daily News that Liang's behaviour showed 'negligence'. He said: 'The guy is dying and you still haven't called it in?' The officers were also uncertain of their exact location, the newspaper reported, something that further hampered emergency services response to the death. The details of what happened in the aftermath of the shooting are at the centre of an investigation by Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson. He is expected to present evidence to a grand jury as early as the end of this month, but has already called the death 'deeply troubling' and has promised a 'thorough investigation'. Gurley, 28, was pronounced dead at Brookdale Hospital shortly after the shooting and his death has been ruled a homicide. He is to be laid to rest tomorrow. His mother, Sylvia Parker, and stepfather, Kenneth Palmer, are scheduled to make their first public statements today. Left behind: Gurley was the father to a two-year-old daughter, Akaila, seen above . Liang and Landau were not supposed to be patrolling near the the stairwells of the housing block when the shooting occurred. Instead police chiefs had called for officers to stick to exterior patrols - so officers could be seen on the beat - following a spike in violent crime in the area. The shooting happened after Liang opened a door while holding a flashlight in his right hand along with a Glock 9-mm. The gun fired and hit Gurley in the chest as he walked with his girlfriend Melissa Butler, 27, some 12 feet below the officer. Liang was then said to have told Landau, 'I think I'm going to get fired', before he had even noticed that the bullet had ricocheted and hit Gurley. It wasn't until the men saw Butler sobbing over her boyfriends body that they realised what had occurred. Justice: Now, the Brooklyn district attorney's office is launching an investigation into the shooting as friends and family mourn Gurley's death (above) Butler then ran to a neighbour's and called 911 saying she 'feared for her life'. When the two officers returned to radio communication they reported an accidental discharge. Lt. Vitaliy Zelikov, who arrived on the scene in the aftermath, said Liang was 'visibly upset, shaken up and clearly very distraught'. On Monday, Butler met with the DA Thompson. He had also met with community leaders on Sunday after more than 250 people marched in protest outside Liang's 75th Precinct the day before calling for justice. The Internal Affairs Bureau of the NYPD has also launched an investigation into the shooting of Gurley, Commissioner Bill Bratton called a 'total innocent.' Gurley, who has been described as a 'peacemaker,' was the father to a two-year-old daughter, Akaila.","Peter Liang talked with his partner for six minutes before reporting death .

"The New York police officer who held Eric Garner in the chokehold that killed him has been sued three times for allegedly violating the constitutional rights of other blacks he and fellow cops arrested. A 2013 federal court lawsuit alleges that Daniel Pantaleo, 29, and at least four other officers subjected Darren Collins and Tommy Rice to 'humiliating and unlawful strip searches in public view'. Collins and Rice were handcuffed and searched for drugs after being arrested on Staten Island in March 2012. Charges against the two men were ultimately dismissed. Scroll down for video . Eric Garner's death pushed politicians to talk about the need for better police training, body cameras and changes in the grand jury process to restore faith in the legal system . According to USA Today, a court complaint charged that the officers 'pulled down the plaintiffs' pants and underwear, and touched and searched their genital areas, or stood by while this was done in their presence'. Collins, 46, and Rice, 43, said Pantaleo 'slapped' and 'tapped' their testicles in broad daylight. The officers denied the charges, insisting they acted reasonably and exercised their discretion, but the lawsuit was settled last year for $30,000. In a separate incident, Rylawn Walker alleged that Pantaleo and other officers falsely arrested him on Staten Island for marijuana possession in February 2012. The federal lawsuit against the officers maintained that Walker 'was committing no crime at that time and was not acting in a suspicious manner'. The charges against Walker were later dismissed. In an August 2014 letter to U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos, Walker's defense lawyer Michael Colihan wrote: 'To put it mildly, many police on Staten Island have been playing fast, loose and violently with the public they seem to have forgotten they are sworn to protect. In an incident caught on camera, Pantaleo was seen placing Garner (pictured), a 43-year-old father, in a chokehold in the street and ignoring his cries that he could not breathe. Garner later died in hospital . 'After litigating about 200 of these civil rights matters in the Eastern and Southern Districts of New York since 1977, I have seen no interest by the managers of the New York City Police Department, or anyone employed by the city of New York, in doing anything to stop this.' A third incident involved 22-year-old Kenneth Collins, from Staten Island, who  filed a lawsuit alleging that Pantaleo and other officers violated his rights during a February 2012 marijuana arrest. He claimed he had been falsely arrested and 'was subjected to a degrading search of his private parts and genitals by the defendants'. On Wednesday, authorities announced that a Staten Island grand jury had decided not to indict Pantaleo for his role in Eric Garner's death last July. In an incident caught on camera, Pantaleo was seen placing Garner, a 43-year-old father, in a chokehold in the street and ignoring his cries that he could not breathe. Garner later died in hospital. A video shows the aftermath of the chokehold where Garner lies on the floor in cuffs. He had told police 11 times that he could not breathe after they jumped on him when he was found selling untaxed cigarettes . Pantaleo had been stripped of his gun and badge and will remain on desk duty pending an internal police investigation that could result in administrative charges. In his statement on Wednesday, he said: 'It is never my intention to harm anyone and I feel very bad about the death of Mr Garner...I hope that they will accept my personal condolences for their loss.' But Garner's widow Esaw Snipes-Garner, 46, has refused to accept the apology and said it came as no surprise that Pantaleo was not indicted. Eric Garner's widow Esaw Snipes-Garner, 46, has refused to accept Palenteo's apology and said it came as no surprise that he was not indicted . Speaking on the Today show on Thursday morning, she said: 'The time to apologize or have any remorse would have been when my husband was screaming and he couldn't breathe. 'Honestly, I think from the beginning I had no faith in Staten Island prosecuting anybody from Staten Island.' 'I felt no remorse, I felt no compassion, no anything from Staten Island - besides the people on Staten Island. As far as the police and the DA - there was no sincerity in his eyes form day one.' The decision not to indict Pantaleo sparked protests across New York City and nationwide, with demonstrators turning out in such cities as Denver, Detroit and Minneapolis. It has also pushed politicians to talk about the need for better police training, body cameras and changes in the grand jury process to restore faith in the legal system. At a news conference in New York after a night of protests led to 83 arrests, the Rev. Al Sharpton called the state-level grand jury system 'broken' when it comes to police brutality cases and urged federal authorities to fix it. 'The federal government must do in the 21st century what it did in the mid-20th century,' he said. 'Federal intervention must come now and protect people from state grand juries.'

"Title favourites Chelsea drew 1-1 with 10-man Manchester City after Frank Lampard came off the bench to salvage a point for the hosts against his former employers. Here, Sportsmail's Ian Ladyman gives his verdict on the performances of both sets of players . MANCHESTER CITY . JOE HART 6.5 - Not called seriously into action before the goal, largely thanks to the defending in front of him. PABLO ZABALETA 7  - Got through some good work down the right hand side and teamed up well with James Milner. Rash tackle for second booking. VINCENT KOMPANY 8 - A super example of leadership and intelligent defending from City’s captain. Won his duel with Diego Costa. Manchester City captain won his highly-anticipated duel with Diego Costa at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday . ELIAQUIM MANGALA 7.5 - A debut for the new signing and an impressive one, too. Looked like he had partnered Kompany for years. ALEKSANDAR KOLAROV 7 - Not always the cutest defender but doesn’t make mistakes either. A solid afternoon. FERNANDINHO 7.5 - City’s most important holding player, the Brazilian was terrific again here. YAYA TOURE 7.5 - Much improved after the horrors of Munich but couldn’t get forward effectively once City had ten . Frank Lampard scores against his former club but declines to celebrate his vital strike in the 1-1 draw . JAMES MILNER 7 - An under-rated player by many people but came in and did a good job here. Delicate touch to set up equaliser. EDIN DZEKO 7 - Relishing in an increased amount of game town and looked more dangerous than Aguero. DAVID SILVA 6.5 - Couldn’t quite see enough of the ball to regularly hurt Chelsea but involved in equaliser. SERGIO AGUERO 6.5 - Still doesn’t look himself after a run of injuries. Will get sharper with games. SUBS : Sagna 6, Navas 6, Lampard  7 . Sergio Aguero appeared off the pace during the match against Chelsea following a run of injuries . CHELSEA . THIBAUT COURTOIS 7 - Not worked overly hard but good low save from Aguero early in the second half. Dependable. BRANISLAV IVANOVIC 7 - A reliable influence on this Chelsea team, the big full-back rarely lets his team down. GARY CAHILL 7 - Looks a better player than he is because of the influence of John Terry. It’s a partnership that works, though. John Terry, pictured here confronting David Silva, proved he is still one of England's best defenders on his day . JOHN TERRY 8 - On days like his he still looks like one of the best defenders in the country. Big games bring the best from him. CESAR AZPILICUETA 7 - Still finding his way in this team but did a reasonable job on stifling the threat of Milner and Zabaleta down his side . CESC FABREGAS 6.5 - He is important to Chelsea’s rhythm and rarely wasted the ball. Lacked a decisive influence though. Cesc Fabregas celebrates Chelsea's opener against Manchester City scored by Andre Schurrle (right) NEMANJA MATIC 6.5 - Similarly, Matic’s importance to Chelsea is growing and he is dangerous when breaking. WILLIAN 6.5 - Couldn’t see enough of the ball in the time he had on the field. Lacked some subtlety too. RAMIRES 6 - Worked hard as always, especially in the first half when City had more of the ball. EDEN HAZARD 7.5 - Coveted by City at one point, the Belgian has a devastating turn of pace over five years and worried the home team constantly with his direct running. Eden Hazard provided the valuable assist for Schurrle during another impressive performance for the Blues . DIEGO COSTA 7 - Suffered at the hands of the brilliant Kompany but managed to free himself long enough to feel Hazard in the run-up to the goal. SUBS: Mikel 6, Schurrle 7, Drobga, 6 . REFEREE: Mike Dean 5.5 - Too many cards in the first half meant that a red card was always a distinct possibility.","Frank Lampard came off the bench to score against his former club .

"Lewis Hamilton took pole position for Sunday's Singapore Grand Prix by a margin so small it was practically beyond comprehension. After 3.147 miles, the slender figure of 0.007sec was all that split the Briton and Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg in their latest, thrilling skirmish for the Formula One World Championship. The qualifying session was just as electrifying as the Marina Bay setting.

Could Hamilton or Rosberg, still on their final laps, knock Red Bull’s Australian off top spot? Rosberg, clean and serene, did so by two-tenths of a second. Then we saw Hamilton lock up his front left wheel at the first corner of his last lap. Surely his challenge was over? But no, he found glorious pace through the remaining 22 corners to win the day. 1. Lewis Hamilton (Britain) Mercedes 1:45.681 . 2. Nico Rosberg (Germany) Mercedes 1:45.688 . 3.

Hamilton’s father Anthony punched the air, smiled widely and high-fived in the Mercedes garage. Hamilton Jnr, who needs to retain the momentum he gained by winning the last race at Monza if he is to reduce his 22-point deficit to Rosberg, said: ‘007 — James Bond — that’s cool! It was the most exciting qualifying session I have had for a long time. I guess no one was expecting to see how close everyone was. There were a lot of people really in the mix and that is when you have to be so on it. ‘You have to be spot on and I was almost there. I locked up at the apex of Turn One. I was down two-tenths by the time I got to Turn Five. I thought it would be impossible to regain it but the previous lap there were a couple of corners where I lost out, so I sorted them out.’ Rosberg was told what Hamilton had done to him and yelled down the radio: ‘Damn it!’ For once, though, there was little sign of animosity between them as they shook hands. ‘Seven-thousandths, when I think back to the lap, is nothing,’ said Rosberg. ‘A bit more here or there and I could have done it. Lewis did a good job to get pole, so fair play. There is a long race ahead and second is fine.’ Reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel will start in fourth having won the last three races in Singapore . Hamilton's team mate Nico Rosberg replied 'damm it' on radio after being informed of Hamilton's pole lap . Lewis Hamilton's 0.007 second qualifying victory over Mercedes team mate Nico Rosberg is also how much younger an astronaut is after 6 months in space than if they had stayed on earth. Hamilton’s second successive pole and sixth of the season gives him a significant advantage in today’s race on the slow, narrow circuit — the East’s answer to Monaco, both in its racing characteristics and its glitzy appeal. However, a safety car has been deployed at all six previous stagings of this grand prix and the likelihood of a similar interuption today offers unpredictability and hope to Hamilton’s pursuers, who are led by Rosberg, Ricciardo and his Red Bull team-mate Sebastian Vettel, and Ferrari’s Fernando Alonso. Ricciardo, who is third in the championship 72 points behind Rosberg, is at least in the best position to take advantage of any Mercedes slip-ups. With three wins to his name this season, Ricciardo said: ‘To end up being closer than we thought, it has been a good day. It was good fun. Hopefully I can keep it up tomorrow and get a better view from the podium. ‘It’s encouraging. Coming into the weekend I thought that if we could be within two or three-tenths, it should give us a more optimistic chance in the race to stay with them, so, yeah, I think we ended up a bit closer than we thought we would. ‘The track was really improving so you had to adapt a lot during the session. Street circuits normally tend to be like that, so it keeps you on your toes. Street circuits are fun. ‘I think all us drivers enjoy them. You jump across kerbs, you brush near the wall; the closer you get the more you want to risk and I guess that’s why we race, we love that rush, that adrenaline.’ The Singapore Grand Prix offers up spectacular views over the night sky as the street circuit hosts F1 . Doubts over how the tyres will last the gruelling corners and heat offer another potentially important factor in a remorseless race that tests every caliper, disc and pad of the brakes to near destruction point.Another unknown is the new, part-ban on pit-to-car radio transmissions but both Rosberg and Hamilton dismissed that as a critical factor in their likely fortunes today. While Hamilton was celebrating, his fellow Brit Jenson Button was 11th, losing out in qualifying for the third successive time to his rookie McLaren team-mate Kevin Magnussen, who was ninth.

"The prospect of a Formula One Grand Prix through the streets of central London could take a huge step forward this week. A detailed 3.2 mile circuit is believed to have been drawn up by Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone that would see the likes of Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton start on The Mall and race past Buckingham Palace and through Parliament Square. Experts predict a Monaco-style event through the capital could be worth well over £100million in ticket revenue and endorsements but would currently require an Act of Parliament to suspend 30mph speed limits and other safety laws along the length of the route.

Jenson Button is excited about developments, saying: 'When I first saw Santander’s plans for a London Grand Prix, I knew they were ambitious, but fantastic – the thought of a race through the capital’s streets was only a dream when they initiated the project, but this week’s changes to the law bring the idea a step closer to reality. 'When you really picture what it would look like it’s truly mind blowing. You could create such a unique grand prix through the streets of London – the roads are naturally very wide and long, so straightline speeds would be high, and you could create a real blend of corners. 'When you combine all of that with the world famous monuments that would feature in the backdrop you can see why it would be an awesome addition to the calendar. 'The dream has taken a step closer this week, and I’d love to see this amazing concept finally happen.' Happy as can be: Jenson Button, with fiancée Jessica Michibata, is excited about the ambitious project . Mayor Boris Johnson is understood to broadly support the plan provided issues with pollution and noise impact are addressed. He said: 'I am always interested in projects that attract jobs and bring growth. 'The question of air quality and noise impact will have to be looked at. I am broadly positive providing we can satisfy the air quality and noise issues.' The Mayor added it was important to see if there was 'a really good economic case' for a London Grand Prix. According to The Times, the race has the support of several senior Government ministers including Minister Without Portfolio Kenneth Clark, Philip Hammond, the Defence Secretery, and Patrick McLoughlin. Ecclestone believes the race would be even more impressive than the Monaco Grand Prix, currently the most famous and glamorous of motor racing’s street circuits. The event could become the richest race in the road with around 120,000 fans filling the grandstands around the capital's most famous landmarks with a potential global TV audience of a billion. Streamline: The route will take in some of the capital's most famous and iconic landmarks, including Westminster . Stand and deliver: Ecclestone believes the race would be even more impressive than the Monaco Grand Prix . Impressive: The proposals are an initiative way of seeing the likes of Sebastian Vettel up closer . In 2012 Ecclestone said: ‘With the way things are, maybe we would front it and put the money up for it. If we got the okay and everything was fine, I think we could do that. 'Think what it would do for tourism. It would be fantastic — good for London, good for England — a lot better than the Olympics.’ A London Grand Prix is not a new idea and was first raised by the Government in 2011, but since then the launch of a formal consultation has been tied up in Whitehall wrangling. The move is expected to meet with opposition from environmental groups. Darren Johnson, a Green London Assembly member described the race through London as a 'terrible idea'. He said: 'Formula One should stick to the dedicated race tracks and leave our streets form ordinary Londoners to enjoy.'","Formula One race through London could be worth well over £100million .

"The wife of former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice has hit out at critics of her husband after he was given an indefinite ban from the NFL for punching her. Footage of the incident, which happened in February, emerged this week leading to public outrage and the termination of Rice's Ravens contract. But Janay Rice, who married the American football star a month after the violent attack in Atlantic City, expressed her pain at the media reaction, and sympathised with her husband.

'I woke up this morning feeling like I had a horrible nightmare, feeling like I'm mourning the death of my closest friend,' Rice posted on her Instagram account. 'But to have to accept the fact that it's reality is a nightmare in itself. No one knows the pain that the media & unwanted opinions from the public has caused my family.' 'To make us relive a moment in our lives that we regret everyday is a horrible thing.

Just know we will continue to grow & show the world what real love is! Rice finished the message with the sign-off 'Ravensnation we love you!' The video, which emerged on Monday, led to a media storm about the length of Rice's original ban.

"There will be a fresh sense of optimism in and around the Emirates on Saturday lunchtime as Arsenal take on Manchester City in the latest blockbuster Premier League clash. The sight of Danny Welbeck, their £16m deadline-day signing from Manchester United, scoring twice for England in their Euro 2016 opener with Switzerland will have gladdened the hearts of the Arsenal faithful. The striker looks revitalised by a change of surroundings and a new challenge, ready to feed off the ammunition supplied to him by Alexis Sanchez, Aaron Ramsey, Santi Cazorla and Mesut Ozil. Scroll down for VIDEOS... Arsene Wenger knows Arsenal's record against the big clubs must improve if they are to sustain a Premier League title challenge - they have collected just 26 points from 90 against the top four over the last five years . Wenger hopes that £16m striker Danny Welbeck can supply the goals to power Arsenal to the title .

In terms of craft and creativity, there are few midfields in the top flight that can match the one Arsenal now boast - at least on paper. But in order to return the title to north London for the first time in a decade, there is one thing that must change, starting this weekend. Arsenal's recent record against their title rivals is very poor; their last 30 matches against their fellow incumbents in the top four have yielded just seven wins and 18 defeats. They have collected a meagre 26 points out of a possible 90 during this five-year period against the big boys. Manchester City put six past Arsenal shortly before Christmas last season, denting their title hopes . Arsene Wenger can only look on in dismay as Manuel Pellegrini celebrates City's fifth goal in the rout . Arsenal also suffered humiliation at the hands of Liverpool, losing 5-1 at Anfield last season . Arsenal have finished in the top four for each the last five Premier League seasons, unlike their rivals Chelsea, Man United, Man City and Liverpool, who have all had at least one season outside the Champions League places. But even with just 30 matches played against their rivals, their points-per-game ratio is the worst. Chelsea have fared best in the big games, winning 17 out of 32 against teams that finished that season in the top four. One thing that might cheer up Arsenal fans is that their rivals Spurs have a worse record in the big games... SOURCE: OPTA . Jack Wilshere doesn't know how to react as Liverpool score one of their five goals last season . Chelsea thrashed Arsenal 6-0 in March this year as the Gunners' woeful record against their rivals continued . Their cause was not helped when referee Andre Marriner erroneously sent off Kieran Gibbs . The TV companies have not done Arsenal a favour in scheduling their match with Manchester City for 12.45pm. The Gunners' biggest beatings last season - 3-6 at City, 1-5 at Liverpool and 0-6 at Chelsea - were all 12.45pm starts. It is this inability to beat their nearest challengers on a regular basis that is making the difference between finishing first and finishing fourth, and Arsene Wenger knows he need to address it. Last season was a prime example - Arsenal were flying high when goals from Cazorla and Ramsey saw off Liverpool at the Emirates in November and it genuinely looked like their year. But things quickly unravelled. They were thumped 6-3 by Manchester City, 5-1 by Liverpool and 6-0 by Chelsea away from home, ultimately finishing fourth - enough to secure Champions League football for the 17th consecutive season but a disappointing return given they led the table until February. Arsenal's 8-2 loss at Manchester United back in 2011 ranks as the worst of their big-match losses . Arsene Wenger cuts a lonely figure as Arsenal are taken apart at Old Trafford in August 2011 . Rafael van der Vaart celebrates with the TV camera after scoring for Spurs in the October 2011 derby . The season before, they failed to pick up a win against Manchester United, Manchester City and Chelsea - the three sides who finished above them. In 2011-12, they were thrashed 8-2 at Old Trafford and also lost on the road to rivals Tottenham and City. These defeats in big matches are disastrous and have been going on too long. The fear factor must be overcome and there's no time like the present to make the change. Arsenal face City on Saturday, play Tottenham at home on September 27 and then travel to Chelsea on October 5. This is a team packed with quality, they need to make a big statement against their title rivals. 2013-2014 . November 6 - Arsenal 2 Liverpool 0 . December 14 - Manchester City 6 Arsenal 3 .

"The David Moyes era is slowly but surely fading away and with it, so are the former Manchester United manager's players. The 2013-14 squad photograph has a few faces that are still lurking around the Old Trafford corridors - such as Marouane Fellaini and Anderson - but who's been ushered towards the exit? The team photo from September 26, 2013 tells all. Louis van Gaal has stripped and sold the scraps for parts in what appears to be an exciting new attacking era for those in the red half of Manchester. You can like our Manchester United Facebook page here . A total of 17 players or staff have left the club since the beginning of the 2013-14 season under David Moyes - United finished seventh in the Premier League . Back row: Danny Welbeck, Phil Jones, Chris Smalling, Jonny Evans, Marouane Fellaini, Rio Ferdinand, Michael Carrick, Robin van Persie . Third Row: Masseur Garry Armer, performance analyst Paul Brand, head of fitness Tony Strudwick, Antonio Valencia, Darren Fletcher, Wilfried Zaha, Adnan Januzaj, Fabio da Silva, masseur Rod Thornley, kit Manager Alec Wylie, physio Neil Hough . Second Row: Assistant kit manager Ian Buckingham, physio Rob Swire, Dr Steve McNally, Alexander Buttner, Sam Johnstone, Anders Lindegaard, David de Gea, Ben Amos, Ashley Young, coach Phil Neville, masseur Andy Caveney, goalkeeping coach Chris Woods . Front Row: Shinji Kagawa, Rafael da Silva, Anderson, Nani, assistant Manager Steve Round, Ryan Giggs, manager David Moyes, Nemanja Vidic, coach Jimmy Lumsden, Patrice Evra, Javier ""Chicharito"" Hernandez, Tom Cleverley and Wayne Rooney . Danny Welbeck (back row, far left) The striker was sick of playing second fiddle to Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Co and joined Arsenal for £16million in a deadline-day move. Under Moyes, he averaged just 58 minutes per game. Danny Welbeck left Manchester United for Arsenal in a £16million, described as the 'bargain of the century' Rio Ferdinand (back row, third from right) The defender makes a tasty return to Old Trafford on Sunday with Queens Park Rangers and will be told to try and contain Radamel Falcao and United's new attacking line-up. Former England international Ferdinand turned down two other London clubs in favour of joining Harry Redknapp at Loftus Road. Veteran defender Rio Ferdinand will line up for Queens Park Rangers against his former club at Old Trafford on Sunday . Wilfried Zaha (third row, sixth from right) Zaha never truly got going at United, making just two Premier League appearances, and the winger was given permission to return to Crystal Palace, a club he helped win promotion to the top flight in 2013, on a season-long loan. Fabio da Silva (third row, fourth from right) Now on the books of Cardiff City, the full-back left United after spending a year on loan at QPR. In his six years in Manchester, Fabio managed just 22 Premier League appearances, compared with his brother, Rafael, who has broken the 100 mark. Fabio da Silva marks Wilfried Zaha and the pair are both no longer at Manchester United . Alexander Buttner (second row, fourth from left) Buttner joined Dynamo Moscow after spending two years with United. The 25-year-old left for £4.4m, having made just 13 Premier League appearances and scoring twice. Van Gaal deemed Buttner surplus to requirements following the signing of Luke Shaw from Southampton. Alexander Buttner moved from Manchester United to Dynamo Moscow after two years at Old Trafford . Coach Phil Neville (second row, third from right) Former Everton defender Neville was reunited with Moyes at United, becoming the first-team coach. The 37-year-old is now concentrating on his career as a pundit for the BBC, and following in the footsteps of his brother, Gary. Phil Neville walks with Ryan Giggs at Old Trafford but only the latter remains at Manchester United . Shinji Kagawa (front row, far left) Kagawa was never loved at Old Trafford the same way he was at Borussia Dortmund and the attacking midfielder returned to the Bundesliga club for £6.3m on a four-year contract. Nani (front row, fourth from left) Nani left to join former club Sporting Lisbon on a season-long loan and, in his own way, helped with the arrival of Marcos Rojo. Nani made 147 appearances in the Premier League and scored 25 goals. Shinji Kagawa laughs with Nani in the background during the pair's time together at Manchester United . Assistant manager Steve Round (front row, fifth from left) The departure of Moyes caused a ripple effect which was felt by his back-room staff. Round, United's assistant manager during the year they finished seventh, was relieved of his duties. Manager David Moyes (front row, centre) United did not qualify for the Champions League for the first time in 19 years and the Old Trafford club had never finished outside of the Premier League top three before. Both records were smashed. The former Everton boss and his coaching staff were paid £5.2m compensation for the sacking. Manchester United assistant manager Steve Round (left) left Manchester United with David Moyes (centre) Nemanja Vidic (front row, sixth from right) After eight years at the club and five Premier League titles - not to mention a Champions League win - Vidic decided enough was enough. The centre-back joined Inter Milan after seeing out his contract. Nemanja Vidic spent eight years at Manchester United and won five Premier League titles during his stint . Coach Jimmy Lumsden (front row, fifth from right) Another to suffer the same fate as Moyes. Lumsden parted company with the club at the same time as assistant manager Round after it all fell apart at Old Trafford. Patrice Evra (front row, fourth from right) After a mammoth 273 Premier League appearances, Evra joined Serie A club Juventus on a two-year deal. The fee was £1.2m for the 33-year-old, who now seems destined to see out his career in Italy. Patrice Evra moved to Serie A club Juventus after 273 Premier League appearances for Manchester United . Javier 'Chicharito' Hernandez (front row, third from right) Hernandez was surplus to requirements up front and fell behind in the pecking order, particularly with the arrival of Radamel Falcao. The striker joined Real Madrid on a season-long loan and the Spanish giants have the option to buy at the end of the deal. Javier Hernandez became surplus to requirements at Manchester United and fell behind the pecking order . Mexico international Javier Hernandez joined Real Madrid on a one-year loan deal with an option to buy . Tom Cleverley (front row, second from right) Cleverley has been in and out of Manchester since 2009, taking in loans at Leicester, Watford and Wigan, and the midfielder has joined Aston Villa for another temporary spell. The 25-year-old would have warmed the bench with Ander Herrera, Angel di Maria and Daley Blind arriving as summer signings. Everton attempted to sign Tom Cleverely on deadline day but the midfielder joined Aston Villa . Tom Cleverley avoided warming the bench at Manchester United by joining Aston Villa late on deadline day . And the rest: . Chris Woods - goalkeeping coach - Woods was told alongside Phil Neville that he would no longer be needed at the club after Moyes' departure in May. Rob Swire - physio - retired in July after being at Manchester United since 1999. He was replaced by assistant Neil Hough.

"A father-of-three from Ohio has been imprisoned in North Korea during a tourism trip to the communist country. Jeffrey Edward Fowle was allegedly arrested after leaving a Bible in a hotel room, although his attorney said that his client was not part of a mission. The 56-year-old is the third American to be held in North Korea, where missionary Kenneth Bae and Matthew Miller are also detained. Arrested: Father-of-three Jeffrey Fowle is being held by the North Korean authorities . Mr Fowle, who works for the street department of Moraine City, had arrived in North Korea on April 29. It is believed he was traveling without his wife, Tatyana, and their children. According to his family, the secretive state is holding Mr Fowle on charges of an unspecified crime. The state Korean Central News Agency said authorities were investigating him for committing acts inconsistent with the purpose of a tourist visit. It did not give details. U.S. officials confirmed the detention but didn't identify Mr Fowle for privacy reasons, nor comment on reports that he was held after leaving a Bible in his hotel room. A spokesman for the family, and Mr Fowle's attorney, have both said he was not on a mission for his church at the time of his arrest. Timothy Tepe, an attorney who is acting as the Fowle family spokesman, confirmed that North Korea was holding Fowle. He said the family would issue statement on Monday and not comment until then, 'given the sensitive nature of Jeff's situation'. 'This is a very fluid situation that has just come to light and they need time to process it,' Mr Tepe said. Detained: American Kenneth Bae was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor in North Korea . He . added that the family man was not on a mission for his church, . Urbancrest Baptist Church in Lebanon, Ohio, and that he was just . visiting North Korea as a tourist. Mark . Edward Howard, who attends Fowle's church, described him as 'a very . good Christian father, a very loving father to his children'. He . said that Mr Fowle's wife, Tatyana, is a Russian immigrant with limited . English, and that Mr Fowle always stayed close to her side in case she . needed interpretation. 'They are pretty much inseparable,' he said. 'You never see him not by her side. They're a very nice family.' Jeff Seidel told WHIO he had spoken to Mrs Fowle, who said she had asked her husband not to travel to North Korea. 'She tried to tell him not to go because it was too dangerous and something might happen, and he didn't listen to her and he went ahead and went anyway,' he said. In . a statement, U.S. Rep. Michael Turner, a Dayton, Ohio Republican, said . he was 'deeply troubled by the detainment of American and Miamisburg . resident Jeffery Edward Fowle, by the authoritarian government of North . Korea'. 'We have been in . contact with the State Department and will continue to carefully monitor . Fowle's detainment as we await the release of additional information,' he said. North Korea has been pushing to promote . tourism as part of efforts to earn much-needed foreign currency, but . the country is extremely sensitive about how visitors act while in . the country. State Department spokeswoman Marie . Harf did not say whether Sweden, which handles consular matters for . Americans in North Korea, had been granted access to the latest . detainee. 'This is the third . U.S. citizen that has been detained in North Korea,' Ms Harf said, adding that there was 'No greater priority for us . than the welfare and safety of U.S. citizens abroad'. The State Department warns against traveling in North Korea and tells travelers that being part of a tour group is no protection against the risk of arrest. On April 10, American Matthew Miller was arrested for alleged improper behavior when he arrived in the country. The 24-year-old is accused of tearing up a tourist visa and demanding asylum, according to a North Korean report that stated that he had chosen the country 'as a shelter'. The third American being held is Mr Bae, who was sentenced to 15 years' hard labor after making what the country described as 'hostile acts' against it. The announcement on Friday that North Korea was holding a third American, comes as tension on the Korean peninsula remains high. The North has kept up its rhetoric against the U.S. and South Korea, after making a series of missile launches earlier in the year. The peninsula is still in a technical state of war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty. About 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea to deter potential aggression from North Korea. In December, North Korea released 85-year-old American veteran of the Korean War, Merrill Newman, who was held for several weeks after traveling to North Korea as a tourist. Mr Newman was freed after he gave a videotaped confession in which he apologized for killing North Koreans during the war. He later said the confession was given involuntarily and under duress.","Jeffrey Fowle is third American currently being held by communist country .

"Click here for your ultimate stats guide, including Mario Balotelli's opener . Step forward Steven Gerrard, the man for the big occasion. No messing, no mistake. Not when it really mattered. From the penalty spot in the 92nd minute, he coolly, expertly, steered Liverpool to their opening Champions League victory against Ludogorets on Tuesday night. Visiting coach Georgi Dermendzhiev claimed his side deserved better and he was right. But no one in red really cares and why should they? An injury-time penalty, taken in front of the Kop for good measure, is Stevie G territory, all right. He scored and Liverpool are off to a winning start in Group B. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard keeps his cool to slot home an injury-time penalty to give the Reds victory against Ludogorets .

Balotelli and Raheem Sterling (right) went close in the first half for Liverpool but were denied by the Ludogorets goalkeeper before the linesman called for offside . Balotelli posted a snap with Gerrard after the game on Instagram and said: 'Steven Gerrard! Yes! Good start guys! Thanks supporters! YOU WERE AMAZING!' Liverpool: Mignolet 6; Manquillo 6, Lovren 6.5, Sakho 6, Moreno 7.5; Henderson 7, Gerrard 7, Lallana 6 (Borini 67, 6); Sterling 7, Coutinho 5 (Lucas 67, 6), Balotelli 5.

Referee: Matej Jug (Slovenia), 6 . *Player ratings by Neil Ashton at Anfield . They had conceded an equaliser in the 90th minute and Javi Manquillo won the penalty 60 seconds later. It was exhilarating and there was barely time to pause for breath before the Kop was in full song. They can’t get enough of this team. It would be easy to tell another tale, the real story behind the 81 frustrating minutes of this game until Mario Balotelli scored for the first time in a Liverpool shirt. To do that, though, would be to highlight the technical difficulties this team encountered against spirited and somewhat unfortunate Bulgarian opponents. Far better to stick with the romance, to fuel those Champions League desires and speak of a dream that ends with Liverpool walking out for the final in Berlin next June. How they have missed these European nights, a glaring omission from the Anfield calendar over the past five seasons. It must have hurt. Gerrard  was certainly psyched up, admonishing Philippe Coutinho for giving the ball away cheaply in the opening spell and having another crack at the little No10 when he shoved Junior Caicara. At times, this new, withdrawn position carved out for Gerrard to spare his ageing legs must frustrate the Liverpool captain. Until he struck the winning goal, he rarely crossed the halfway line. There was so much enthusiasm about the place, so much energy in those red shirts that they spent too much time throwing bodies forward for the majority of the game. Relax, guys. It will come together — it has to with a team boasting the creative talents of Raheem Sterling, Adam Lallana and Coutinho in that forward line. Add the attacking thrust of Alberto Moreno, with those eye-catching runs down the left and his brilliant recovery tackles, and Liverpool will give anyone a game at this level. The target is to get to grips with a dual season, competing at the top of the Barclays Premier League at the weekend and then facing the challenge of Ludogorets, Real Madrid and Basle on these midweek nights. Liverpool's  Lallana, signed from Southampton this summer, hauls down Ludogorets frontman Marcelinho in a bid to win the ball . Lallana fires a shot from the edge of the area towards goal but the ball is cleared by Abel before it reaches the goal . Liverpool defender Mamadou Sakho shows his skill to move the ball away from Ludogorets frontman Roman Beziak . The Bulgarian champions were decent enough, forcing corners in the first half and relying on Anicet Abel and captain Svetoslav Dyakov to get them going. They certainly gave Liverpool a game, capitalising on the growing sense of anxiety which was spreading as this fixture wore on. Patience, patience. There is time and Liverpool had 90 minutes, plus all the other bits and pieces added on at the end of each half, to win their first group game. They had to use all of it. When they scored through Balotelli, Liverpool should have settled and protected their lead. By then they had worked hard enough for it. The goal arrived via the dangerous left-boot of Moreno — a swirling cross that found its way to the feet of Balotelli inside the box. His finish was cool, under pressure to perform after a couple of games without a goal since his return to English football. He is off the mark now. MATCH ZONE: CLICK HERE for your ultimate stats package from the big game - including Balotelli's opener for Liverpool, as illustrated here . Liverpool's Brazilian winger Philippe Coutinho is dispossessed by Anicet Abel (right) in the tackle . Sterling grimaces as the wideman races past the challenge of Ludogorets player Aleksandar Aleksandrov along the touchline . Liverpool's new summer signing Alberto Moreno marauds forward with the ball and puts the Ludogorets backline on the backfoot . The game was nearing its end when Balotelli scored in front of the Kop and that should have been the signal for Liverpool to smother the contest and see it out. Goodness knows they had enough players on the park equipped to do so. Gerrard, Jordan Henderson and substitute Lucas Leiva are streetwise enough to put their foot on the ball. Instead, with the vocal backing of the Kop, they set off in search of a second goal. To blame Sterling simply because he lost the ball on the edge of the Ludogorets penalty area would not do justice to his energetic and captivating peformamce. Nevertheless, Ludogorets sped away with the ball and within seconds of Sterling being dispossessed, substitute Dani Abalo was rounding Simon Mignolet.

Anfield fell flat, at least until Manquillo was bundled over by Milan Borjan inside the area. Rodgers admitted afterwards: ‘Steven studied videos of their keeper, but then they put in Milan Borjan at the last minute and we had nothing on him.’ It required a cool finish, the game-changing strike that we associate Gerrard with over the years.

"It's been a rollercoaster year for rock band INXS since announcing their retirement. The Aussie rockers dealt with major tragedy and then watched it all play out on the small screen miniseries INXS: Never Tear Us Apart. Despite the personal challenges, the band has topped the highest-selling album in Australia with their greatest hits, The Very Best, which stayed at the No.1 spot for seven weeks this year after the success of the record-breaking four-hour miniseries. The band realised the popular telemovie had quite a hand to play in the resurgence in their popularity, which also sparked a surge in sales, selling more than 280,000 copies. Scroll down for video . Left: Tim Farriss, Kirk Pengilly, Jon Farriss and Andrew Farriss of INXS pose at the special Quadruple Platinum plaque presentation at Universal Music on Friday . 'To be honest, with the miniseries coming out it's no surprise we sold a few more records,' said guitarist Tim Farriss. 'I never guessed we would sell that many to make quadruple platinum and the biggest selling album in Australia for the year, which is fantastic and a great honour.' One of the reasons band member Kirk Pengilly thinks it pushed INXS back into the spotlight is because it showed people at home just how much the guys put into their music. 'The thing I got from it was now all Australians know how hard we worked and what we actually achieved. I don't think a lot of Australians were really aware of that,' Pengilly said.

But it hasn't just been a year of celebration for the Farriss brothers - Jon, Andrew and Tim - who lost their father just a few weeks ago. Andrew also revealed his wife has been battling breast cancer. 'I was struggling about whether to say this, but I'll tell the truth. When all that was happening (the making of the TV miniseries) my wife was diagnosed with breast cancer, so I wasn't really concerned with the past or what it meant,' he said. 'I love these guys ... but I was very much in the now. So for me, I then replay it as an amazing blessing to have had all those accolades and attention given at the time I was just absolutely smacked with reality from a different area,' he said. His wife is doing better and he says he now feels lucky the band have had this experience. 'It's been an interesting year,' he said. Michael Hutchence with INXS performing at the Forum London, Britain in 1993 . The band lost their frontman Michael Hutchence, who was found dead in his hotel room in 1997 . INXS annouced their sudden retirement in 2012, just days before anniversary of Michael Hutchence's death . The band seem used to the crazy highs and lows they've had to endure, not least of all losing their frontman Michael Hutchence, who died in 1997. They agree that this year has been particularly mixed with hardship and success, but Tim says 'nothing comes in small measure for us. It's always INXS'. For the most part, they were happy with how the TV series turned out and Tim in particular was very hands-on, as an executive producer on the show. 'Tim was there all the way through it and we're indebted to Tim for that - to relive it again and have the rollercoaster of emotion it must have taken its toll,' Jon said. The Aussie rockers who made it big globally, dealt with major tragedy and then watched it all play out successfully in a four-hour miniseries . Despite their sudden retirement in 2012, the band has not ruled out a reunion completely . While it was difficult to portray everything perfectly in a four-hour miniseries, the band agrees it captured the essence or the vibe of that time in their life very accurately. Tim said the actor who played Michael Hutchence, Luke Arnold, was so like the frontman, that it was almost eerie. 'The similarities, it was honestly like being in the same room as him,' Tim said. The band announced their sudden retirement in 2012 after a live performance in Perth, but they haven't ruled out a reunion completely. 'I announced in Perth that it was likely to be the last concert we would play and it still stands,' Jon said. But there is definitely some wiggle room on that as Tim put it: 'Well, you're never going to get a definite no from us.'","Their greatest hits album went quadruple platinum and topped the charts .

"The Obama administration on Friday accused a Chinese fighter jet of conducting a 'dangerous intercept' of a U.S. Navy surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft off the coast of China in international airspace — the fourth such incident since March. The Pentagon press secretary, Rear Adm. John Kirby, said Washington protested to the Chinese military through diplomatic channels, calling the fighter pilot's actions 'unsafe and unprofessional'. And U.S. officials said this is at least the second formal complaint American diplomats have filed with the Chinese over these military actions in recent months. At a news briefing at Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, where President Barack Obama is vacationing, Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, called the intercept 'a deeply concerning provocation' and suggested it could set back efforts to improve relations. Scroll down for video . Dangerously close: This photo - taken from a  U.S. Navy surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft off the coast of China in international airspace on August 19 - shows how precariously close the Chinese fighter jet came to the American plane . Dangerous: The Pentagon said Friday that a Chinese fighter jet made 'several passes' by a U.S. Navy aircraft earlier this week . Hot shot: The Chinese jet made several close passes by the Navy P-8 Poseidon plane, coming within 30 feet of it and doing a 'barrel roll' maneuver over the top of the Poseidon . 'What we've encouraged is constructive military-to-military ties with China, and this kind of action clearly violates the spirit of that engagement,' Rhodes told reporters. U.S. officials said it appears that the same Chinese military unit out of a base on Hainan Island was responsible for similar aggressive 'close intercepts' in March, April and May. The officials refused to provide any details of the previous incidents but said the U.S. filed a similar formal complaint with the Chinese in May. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the previous incidents publicly. Kirby said the Aug. 19 maneuvering by the Chinese jet posed a risk to the safety of the U.S. air crew, was 'inconsistent with customary international law', and complicates efforts to improve military-to-military relations, which are often strained. Kirby said the Chinese jet made several close passes by the Navy P-8 Poseidon plane, coming within 30 feet of it at one point. He said the Chinese jet did a 'barrel roll' maneuver over the top of the Poseidon at one point and also passed across the nose of the Navy plane, exposing the belly of the fighter in a way apparently designed to show that it was armed. Not happy: Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said Washington has lodged a protest to China through diplomatic channels, calling the maneuver 'very close' and 'very dangerous' Kirby said it happened about 135 miles east of China's Hainan Island. In 2001 a Chinese jet collided with a U.S. Navy surveillance aircraft off Hainan Island, killing the Chinese pilot and forcing the Navy plane to make an emergency landing on the island. Washington severed military relations with China after that episode. The Navy's P-8 Poseidon aircraft are designed for long-range missions including intelligence collection and reconnaissance.","Intercept occurred in international air space about 135 miles east of Hainan Island, China, on August 19 .

"Unconventional diet: Mike Snell has lost over ten stone by eating curry for breakfast every morning . A father has lost more than ten stone in less than a year with an unconventional diet that includes curries for breakfast every morning. Mike Snell, 38, from Chester, invented his own unique diet that involved wolfing down a vindaloo every morning at 6am. The meal plan has led to him going from 24st to 13st 13lbs in just 11 months. The delivery driver's eating habits became similar to those recommended on the fast diet - as he would gorge on his favourite foods until 10am but then eat little else all day. Mike would always start with a hearty helping of vindaloo to fire up his metabolism and then ate anything else he fancied, which satisfied his cravings for the day. He would then just have a light snack such as a bowl of soup in the evening. The bizarre approach to dieting has worked wonders for Mike who is now slimmer than he's ever been. He had piled on the pounds thanks to his job as constantly being on the move making deliveries meant the father-of-two had to grab whatever he could to eat. As a result, he used to gorge on cakes and chocolates while making deliveries to supermarkets. He would also stop off at burger vans between rounds and stock up on bacon butties and other fatty meals. It was in January this year that Mike finally decided to make a change when a colleague commented on how out of breath he was after hitching up his trailer. So Mike devised his own way of going about dieting as he found traditional approaches were not effective. He said: 'I wanted to go about dieting a different way to how you would expect. The problem for me is that if someone tells me I can't eat something I just want to eat it even more. 'So I decided I wanted to do a diet that would mean I could eat whatever I wanted. As he was: Mike put on weight as he used to snack on cakes and chocolates and stop at burger vans for lunch as he worked as a delivery driver . Now: Mike starts his day with a vindaloo at 6am everyday but says he keeps his diet interesting by adding different ingredients to his favourite Indian dish . 'The point of eating at six in the morning is that it takes away the cravings for the rest of the day. 'I carried on eating the same things, so lots of carbs and sugars, until 10am.' Despite the consistency of his diet Mike says he is not yet bored of curry and has found ways of keeping his meals exciting. 'I have a chicken vindaloo every morning. I have it a bit differently everyday to keep it interesting. 'I'll have salad with baby leaves one day and others I'll add broccoli or tinned veg.' Amazingly, Mike has not undertaken any extra exercise and says his incredible weight loss is down to diet alone. Mike is thrilled with his impressive weight loss but says his girlfriend was happier when he was larger . As well as his physical change, Mike says that since his weight loss he has a far more positive demeanor. 'In recent months clothes shopping has been amazing, I feel like I have finally been able to work out what kind of person I am,' he said. 'I also find that when I am out and about people start talking to me that wouldn't have before and also the other way around - I'm not worried about approaching other people as well.' He added: 'I'm so much happier now. My daughters think I'm a completely different man. They love taking me shopping now.' However, not everyone is completely happy with his transformation. 'It took my girlfriend a while to get used to it. I was 23 stone when she met me. 'She finds it weird - she says I'm not the same man that I used to be. She's not happy with me!'","Mike Snell starts every morning with a vindaloo curry for breakfast at 6am .

"Top Gear presenter Richard Hammond has said the Argentinians behaved 'like animals' and threw rocks at them when they filmed the much-publicised Christmas special in the country. The Top Gear cast and crew had to flee the South American country after they were attacked by an angry mob, which frontman Jeremy Clarkson described as 'the most terrifying thing I've ever been involved in.' Clarkson, who has been widely criticised in the past for making insensitive jokes, was pictured in a Porsche with the licence plate 'H982 FKL' - thought by some to refer to the war of 1982. The controversial number plate inflamed long-running tensions and incensed locals, with Clarkson claiming they wanted to 'barbecue us and eat the meat'. Scroll down for video . Top Gear presenter Richard Hammond maintains the controversial numberplate was simply a coincidence . He said the Argentinians 'behaved like animals' when they smashed up the cast's classic cars . Argentine officials and newspapers took offence at the number plate, which they said was a 'provocation' Speaking on tonight's Chatty Man on Channel 4, Hammond maintains the number plate was a coincidence and criticised the animosity directed at them. He tells host Alan Carr: 'They scared the crap out of our crew and that is unfair. You will see it all in the show. Every window on every car was smashed.' He added: 'That car, there were only two in the UK. We have never checked a number plate in our lives. That is the numberplate the car was born with.' His remarks follow previous comments he made to Radio 2 when he claimed the programme team felt 'a real chill' when it dawned on them their number plate could cause offence in Argentina. He said: 'There was a tweet from somebody pointing out that one of the registration plates on one of the cars could be seen as having a reference to the Falklands War. 'There was a real chill went through all of us - it was a distinct moment, we all (went) ""hang on a minute - it's a bit tenuous but yet it probably does""'. He went on: 'That's when we realised we had to do something about it. That's kind of why we've all got our hands up saying ""hang on a minute - the idea that we'd planned that is pretty much impossible and certainly isn't true""'. He added: 'We didn't look at the plates. I've never looked at a number plate that we've used on a car for a special. Not with that kind of cynical outlook. 'You just get the car you want. There were only two of those 928 GTs for sale in the UK at the time - one of which was the one that we got.' 'We do spend quite a lot of time sailing quite close to the line. We know that, our viewers know that and sometimes we only know the line is there when we look back over our shoulders and say ""oh we've gone over it"" and we put our hands up - ""fair enough, we got that wrong"". 'On this occasion we were very keen for our viewers not to think that we would have done that gag, that it was deliberate, because it wasn't. We want them to know that it isn't.' The Top Gear presenter was speaking to Alan Carr on Channel 4's Chatty Man, which will air tonight . The Top Gear team (pictured during their trip to Argentina) including Richard Hammond (far left), Jeremy Clarkson (second left) and James May (far right) were forced to flee the country after being hounded by a mob . The presenters' cars were left by the side of the road in Argentina before they fled across the border to Chile . Clarkson's damaged Porsche with the H982 FKL plate, which locals took to be reference to the 1982 conflict . The BBC refused to apologise to the Argentinian ambassador to the UK, Alicia Castro, after the furore which Clarkson claimed made him fear for his life. In his newspaper column he revealed how he hid under a hotel bed  as an armed mob warned 'this is a mafia state, best you do as you're told'. Together with Hammond and fellow presenter James May they hid while an angry gang of locals rampaged through the building looking for them. Clarkson and the Top Gear team had flown into Buenos Aires on September 17, before heading to the ski resort of Bariloche to start a 1,350 filmed trek along the country's famous Patagonian Highway - route 40 - to the world's southernmost city of Ushuaia. The controversy over his number plate erupted as he neared Ushuaia, from where the General Belgrano sailed only to be torpedoed by the submarine HMS Conqueror during the 1982 conflict. Clarkson said: 'Our producers tried to explain that we were there to film at a ski resort and then to host a game of car football in the city – England v Argentina. The bottom of the World Cup we were going to call it. 'They were not listening. They were angry. They said that they were not violent but that a group of men from the local truckers' trade union were on their way. And that when they arrived things would definitely turn nasty. Our local fixers advised that we stop filming immediately, leave the cars and go to a nearby hotel.' With the locals baying for their blood, government officials warned them to leave the country. Clarkson revealed he and eight other members of the crew 'rounded up the girls from our party' and fled to the airport. But the furious locals pursued the rest of the crew and hurled bricks at their convoy, smashing windows and injuring two of the party - before they escaped via tractor in to Chile. The attack took place in Ushuaia, on the southern tip of Argentina, from where the General Belgrano sailed only to be torpedoed by the submarine HMS Conqueror during the 1982 conflict . The Falkland Islands were taken briefly by Argentina during its 1982 invasion which preceded a 74-day war with Britain. The war claimed the lives of 649 Argentinians and 255 Britons. Argentinian president Cristina Kirchner has attacked Britain repeatedly over the Falklands since taking over power following the death of her husband Nestor. The controversial number plate is not likely to be a private one and was attached to the car when the BBC received it for filming, a spokesman for the show said. The H at the beginning of the plate represents the year in which it was produced - 1991. FKL, the last three letters, represent where the vehicle was first registered. In this case it was Maidstone in Kent. The numbers in between these characters are chosen at random by the DVLA. Porsche confirmed the car was not bought from them by producers at Top Gear, but from a private owner. It is possible to transfer registration plates to a new vehicle for £80. Plates beginning in NIQ or Q - Northern Ireland registered vehicles - cannot be transferred. Motorists cannot transfer a registration plate if it will make the new car look younger. The Falklands issue is particularly sensitive in southern Argentina, and Ushuaia has blocked several British-flagged cruise ships from docking under a controversial local law named after an Argentinian cowboy who led a bloody 19th century uprising against the British. The programme has been embroiled in a string of controversies over the years, including accusations of racism after Clarkson apparently mumbled the word n***** during an outtake and referred to an Asian man as a 'slope' during a Burma special. In 2011, Hammond prompted a complaint by the Mexican ambassador after he suggested a Mexican car would be 'lazy, feckless, flatulent, overweight'. In an interview with the Radio Times, the 44-year-old refused to say whether the BBC have since warned the Top Gear team to be more careful. But he said: 'In society as a whole, we love to be offended and have a scapegoat. 'But at Top Gear we're the first to put our hands up and say we pitched it wrong. We have apologised. 'We're not in the business of genuinely upsetting or offending anyone. We're in the business of entertainment, and if it fails to entertain, it's wrong. If the public says we stepped over the line, then we have.'","Presenter said Argentinians were 'like animals' and threw rocks at them .

"He may be in the twilight of his playing years, but the near-universal adoration heaped on David Beckham has helped him remain the highest earner in British sport, according to the Sunday Times Sport Rich List. Boxers, golfers, racing drivers and basketball players - all fall by the wayside in the global 'brand Beckham' that has seen the 38-year-old amass a fortune of £165 million - and that is without his wife's bank balance of £35m. Beckham's wealth, amassed from endorsement deals and salary payments from his company, Footwork Productions, over the last decade, make him easily the richest British sports star of all time. Top of the league: David Beckham has amassed a massive £165million fortune in his illustrious career as a footballer and celebrity and has been named the richest sportsman in Britain and Ireland . But he is still some way off the richest sportsman in the world - golfer Tiger Woods, who is worth a staggering £570m. Wayne Rooney, Manchester United's current favourite English son, is the richest Barclays Premier League player, with a personal fortune of £51m. The striker is ahead of team-mate Rio Ferdinand (£42m), and Michael Owen (£38m). Footballers account for £1.3bn of the £3.2bn accrued by the top earners and make up nearly half of the Rich List , which is published today and includes current and former sportsmen in Britain and Ireland. Wayne Rooney . Michael Carrick . Frank Lampard . Rio Ferdinand . Steven Gerrard . Michael Owen . It includes 49 footballers, 12 golfers, 12 from the world of motor sport, eight from rugby and five boxers, as well as those connected with horse racing, basketball, cricket, tennis, athletics and showjumping, . Lennox Lewis is the highest paid boxer, whose prize money and property assets give him a personal fortune of £95m. Motor racing features prominently in the top tier of the rich list, with Eddie Irvine (£83m), Lewis Hamilton (£60m), Jenson Button (£58m) and David Coulthard (£53m) among the top 12 richest sportsmen. After a 2012 in which he won gold and silver medals at the Olympics and won Britain its first Grand Slam in more than 70 years, tennis player Andy Murray saw his position at the game's top table put beyond doubt - and his fortune leap by 33%, to £32m. And despite his tender years, 23-year-old Rory McIlroy is worth £20m, just six years after turning professional. But his wealth is set to go stratospheric after he signed a sponsorship deal with Nike in January reportedly worth up to £156m over 10 years. The rich list may highlight the enormous financial clout of Britain's top sports stars, but it is a decidedly one-sided affair - there is not a single woman on the list. The Rich List is based on identifiable wealth, including land, property, other assets such as art and racehorses, or significant shares in publicly quoted companies. It excludes bank accounts. People competing abroad and foreign stars playing here are also eligible, as are football managers and racehorse trainers.

"Gerard Pique has apologised after a furious confrontation with police in Barcelona. The Spain star was in the Port Olimpic area of the city after he had flown back from  international duty, when his brother stopped their car in a bus zone for 15 minutes. Police said that they had been obstructing taxis and other vehicles and issued Pique's brother, Marc, with a fine. Barcelona star Gerard Pique clashed with Spanish police after his brother parked in a bus stop . Pique later apologised for the incident after calling the officers 'a disgrace' and claiming they envied him . This was when Pique, 27, is said to have exploded and ranted at the officers. He got out of his car and said, according to La Vanguardia: 'You envy me because I'm famous. You are fining me because you're on commission, because you have no money and you need to make commission. 'I'm going to speak with your bosses and get you reprimanded. You think you are masters of the world because you wear that uniform and fine people. 'Your father's going to pay this fine - I'm not. You are a disgrace. Your profession makes me sick and the Guardia Urbana is a f****** disgrace.' Pique then allegedly snatched the fine out of his brother's hands and flung it back at police, before the pair entered Casino Barcelona. The Barcelona centre back played for Spain during their 4-0 win against Luxembourg on Sunday evening . Pique took to Twitter to apologise, saying the incident 'has been exaggerated' it 'will not happen again' Pique with girlfriend Shakira on a less eventful night out at the basketball last month . The central defender apologised on Wednesday night for what he had done, although he claimed that the press had exaggerated his comments. 'What I said has been exaggerated a lot, but in any case, I am sorry, I made a mistake and it will not happen again,' he tweeted. Barcelona left-back Jordi Alba was quick to jump to his team-mate's defence, saying: 'The club has nothing to say. It would be bull*** if Barça punished Pique. Besides, he has already said sorry. We all make mistakes.' Some believe Pique's apology even has an element of sarcasm to it because he used the exact wording that former King of Spain Juan Carlos did after he was caught elephant hunting in Africa in 2012. Pique is almost certain to be fined by Barcelona manager Luis Enrique, who has implemented a strict code of behaviour at the club since joining in the summer. The Catalan giants take on La Liga minnows Eibar on Saturday night at the Nou Camp.","'You're a disgrace,' Gerard Pique is alleged to have ranted at officers .

"Laughing rebels filmed the plane as it crashed, gleefully bragging ‘That was a blast – look at the smoke!’ while a fireball rose from the debris. One of the voices is believed to be militia commander Igor Strelkov, who then penned a triumphant war cry on Twitter, saying: ‘We warned you – do not fly in “our sky”.’ A sickening mobile phone video posted online shows a pall of black smoke billowing over the crash site as three rebels provide an excited commentary. The extraordinary footage – apparently filmed by the shooters themselves – charts the terrible final moments of the doomed airliner. Scroll down for video . Gloat: Ukrainian rebel Igor Strelkov published a tweet indicating he thought his rebels had shot down an Antonov-26 military plane of the Ukrainian Air Force. It now appears it was Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 . Their camera does not zoom in enough to . see the plummeting plane in the sky, but the rebels’ voices can be heard . talking happily of ‘black spots – these are the parts flying’, . suggesting it fell to earth in several pieces. A voice believed to be that of Strelkov – dubbed ‘Igor the Terrible’ – announces: ‘The plane was hit!’ He adds: ‘Look at those black spots, these are the parts, flying … it was a blast … look, look, black smoke!’ Another rebel, possibly referring to the missile system, laughs and says: ‘It was worth bringing this thing, wasn’t it?’ None of the rebels can be seen in their horrific film, but it appears to be genuine because at the time only they seemed to know what was happening. Ordinary life carries on in the village where they are standing. A bus trundles by and an unsuspecting villager is seen wandering past the camera. Shortly after the passenger plane was downed, Strelkov – seen smirking in propaganda photos – tweeted a boastful message claiming responsibility. Destroyed: An armed pro-Russian separatist stands at a site of a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 plane crash in the settlement of Grabovo in the Donetsk region of Ukraine . At the time, he apparently believed he had shot down an Antonov-26 military plane of the Ukrainian Air Force, saying it landed near a mine named Progress. His chilling message read: ‘In the area Torez we just hit down An-26, it’s lying somewhere in the mine “Progress”. ‘We warned you – do not fly in “our sky”. And here is the video confirmation of the “bird dropping”. ‘Bird fell near the mine, the residential sector was not disturbed. Civilians are not injured.’ Later as the horror became clear, the tweet was deleted. Transcript that chills the blood . Meanwhile, a Ukrainian newspaper published the transcript of a phone call reportedly intercepted by Ukraine’s security services where rebels are heard discussing finding MH17's wreckage. Militants nicknamed ‘Major’ and ‘Greek’ were recorded speaking as ‘Major’ inspected the crash site and found only ‘civilian items’. Also on the line were Igor Bezler, who the SBU says is a Russian military intelligence officer. Below is the full transcript of the conversation. Far from civilians being unharmed, accounts began to emerge of bodies falling out of the stricken plane over the village of Rassypnaya. Residents said charred and naked bodies lay in the streets. Strelkov, who minutes earlier had been boasting about his ‘military’ success, seems to have gone to ground once he realised his catastrophic mistake. A man of mystery with at least three names, Strelkov believed by Ukraine to be a serving Russian colonel in the Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) of the country’s army – a charge firmly denied by Moscow. He commands pro-Russian forces now in control of Sloviansk in eastern Ukraine, but his enemies suspect he is a direct agent of the Kremlin. People were scouring the area for the black box flight recorders and separatists were later quoted as saying they had found one. According to Russian news agency Interfax, First Deputy Prime Minister Andriy Purgin of the breakaway Donestsk Republic said they will be transferred to Moscow for examination. 'There are highly qualified experts who will be able to accurately determine the cause of the disaster, even though it is so clear,' he said. Meanwhile, armed separatists are hindering search efforts at the crash site, the head of Ukraine's emergency services said. 'The search work is difficult because we are talking about a big radius... but also because armed terrorists who are on the spot are hampering things,' Serhiy Bochkovsky told journalists. He gave no details. The secret . service in Kiev claims his real identity is Igor Girkin. He has an . ex-wife and children still living in Moscow, and his Russian passport . number and address in Moscow have been published by media in Ukraine. Neighbours . in the Moscow suburb where he lives know him as Igor Girkin, but his . men call him Igor Strelok – meaning ‘Igor The Shooter’. Whoever Strelkov is, his name crops up time and again in Russia’s troublespots. He . was in and out of Chechnya between 1999 and 2005 as an agent of the . Federal Security Service – the former KGB – according to some reports. And . when Putin decided to annex Crimea earlier this year, Strelkov was . stirring up hatred on the Russian president’s behalf, Kiev claims. Ukrainian . intelligence says he crossed the Ukrainian border in Simferopol on . February 26, when the Crimean parliament was seized. He was personally blamed for the abduction of several peacekeeping observers from the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Strelkov accused the observers of being ‘professionally trained spies’ carrying ‘special devices’ and claimed Russia would decide their fate. In the Russian right-wing media, Strelkov is regarded as a hero figure, one prepared to sacrifice his life to the cause of the Russian state and its future. One profile called him ‘a Russian civil war romantic’. Others regard him as an enemy, a terrorist and a criminal responsible for several high-profile killings.

In April, the EU named him on its list of sanctioned Russians who were posing threats to Ukraine’s independence. Eccentric Strelkov, who is obsessed by military history, has been known to dress up in the uniforms of civil war generals, as a Cossack and even in a suit of armour. One profiler wrote: ‘He looks like a military officer of an earlier generation, with short hair and clipped moustache, complementing his “little green man” military fatigues. He is quiet-spoken, calm, and – his extreme political views notwithstanding – highly intelligent.’ The news comes as footage that some claim proves Russia has launched military attacks on Ukraine from its own territory emerged today. Some claim that this footage proves Russia has launched military attacks on Ukraine from within its own border . Journalist Roman Bochkala posted a map showing where the alleged attack originated . The images allegedly show an attack by a truck-mounted 'Grad' 122 mm multiple rocket launcher from close to Gukovo in Russia's Rostov region across the frontier into neighbouring Ukraine. Kiev has been making increasingly strong complaints that Moscow is mounting attacks from its own territory as well as supporting insurgents with weapons and reinforcements.Moscow has denied such accusations. The head of organization 'Civil Initiative' Dmitry Snegirev claimed today that this footage - from late on 16 July - shows strikes from Gukovo onto Krasnodonsk district in the Lugansk region of Ukraine. He claimed locals had provided the information about the 'Grad' strikes. Ukrainian journalist Roman Bochkala wrote on Facebook: 'Here is direct evidence of shelling of Ukraine with ""Grad"" from the territory of the Russian Federation. Two units are firing in the village Gukovo, Rostov region.' Claiming it was not the first such strike, he posted a map showing where the alleged attack originated. A phone call between rebels where they are heard to say ‘holy s***’ when they realised their error was intercepted by Ukraine’s security services, according to a Ukrainian newspaper. Militants nicknamed ‘Major’ and ‘Greek’ were recorded speaking as ‘Major’ inspected the crash site and found only ‘civilian items’. Also on the line were Igor Bezler, who authorities says is a Russian military intelligence officer and leading commander of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, and a colonel in the main intelligence department of the general headquarters of the armed forces of the Russian Federation, Vasili Geranin. The unverified transcript was posted online by the Kiev Post newspaper: . Igor Bezler: 'We have just shot down a plane. Group Minera. It fell down beyond Yenakievo (Donetsk Oblast). Vasili Geranin:'Pilots. Where are the pilots?' IB:'Gone to search for and photograph the plane. Its smoking.' VG: 'How many minutes ago?' IB: 'About 30 minutes ago.' The next part of the conversation took place about 40 minutes later, it was reported. Major: 'These are Chernukhin folks who shot down the plane. From the Chernukhin check point. Those cossacks who are based in Chernukhino.' Greek: Yes, Major. Major: 'The plane fell apart in the air. In the area of Petropavlovskaya mine. We have found the first 200 (code word for dead person). A Civilian.' Greek: 'Well, what do you have there? Major: 'In short, it was 100 per cent a passenger (civilian) aircraft.' Greek: 'Are many people there?' Major: 'Holy s***. The debris fell right into the yards (of homes).' Greek: 'What kind of aircraft?' Major: 'I haven’t ascertained this. I haven’t been to the main site. I am only surveying the scene where the first bodies fell. There are the remains of internal brackets, seats and bodies.' Greek: 'Is there anything left of the weapon?' Major: 'Absolutely nothing. Civilian items, medicinal stuff, towels, toilet paper.' Greek: 'Are there documents?' Major: 'Yes, of one Indonesian student. From a university in Thompson.'","Mobile phone footage captures explosion in Ukrainian field .

"There’s nothing like a Ryder Cup for lifting the profile of a player into the stratosphere. Just look at Ian Poulter. Now here comes Europe’s latest hero Jamie Donaldson, long considered one of the best ball strikers on the European Tour but one who is going to have to get used to a whole new level of acclaim following his stunning performance at Gleneagles. Three points out of four and clinching the winning point; who could have imagined that two years ago when he was paired with eventual winner Rory McIlroy in the third round of the USPGA Championship at Kiawah Island, and looked like a man painfully short of belief. Jamie Donaldson and captain Paul McGinley (R) are pictured with the Ryder Cup trophy at Gleneagles . The 38-year-old strikes a comical pose while holding the famous trophy aloft . Donaldson is congratulated after his singles win clinched the point that won the Ryder Cup . VIDEO Donaldson hits Ryder Cup winner . ‘The game’s all in there but it’s a hard task getting him to feel like he belongs with these guys at this level,’ said one of his advisors. Then 36, it seemed questionable whether it would ever come out. Ian Poulter has known him for 15 years and believes everything changed when the personable Welshman defeated a strong field to win in Abu Dhabi in January last year. ‘You could almost see him grow after that victory,’ said Poulter. ‘Since then he has been so consistent. He’s got some serious game.’ Donaldson circled the start of Ryder Cup qualifying in August last year. To that point he’d never considered it a possibility he could make the team but he knew this time he had a chance. In March, he played in the WGC-Cadillac Championship in Miami and racked up loads of qualifying points. Poor performances at the Bridgestone Invitational and the PGA this August, however, left him in grave danger of missing out. Donaldson almost didn't make the Ryder Cup team but for a strong finish to his season . The Welshman lines up his putt en route to a decisive singles victory over Keegan Bradley . He rang captain Paul McGinley, who spelt it out in stark terms. ‘You’ve got to go and play the Czech Open and the Italian Open (the final two qualifying events),’ said the Dubliner. ‘I’ve got to be honest, the picks usually go to experienced players.’ The pressure was seriously on then, but how Donaldson delivered, winning the first of those events. He had shown he belonged. Asked on the eve of the Ryder Cup what it was like to make his debut at the age of 38, he replied: ‘Everyone’s time is different. I was nowhere near the level of making the team in my 20s but my time is now.’ Donaldson was delighted when Lee Westwood was assigned to partner him. Their careers might have developed in different ways but the two men have a lot in common. What a fine partnership it proved, with their two foursomes victories. They were a combined nine-under-par for those two matches and had just two bogeys. Europe's Ryder Cup team celebrate retaining the trophy after a 16.5 - 11.5 victory at Gleneagles . Donaldson was thankful to be partnered with the experienced Lee Westwood (L) So to the singles on Sunday, and a tough match in prospect against American firebrand Keegan Bradley. Donaldson never gave him a look-in. When it was over, he draped the Welsh flag over his shoulders and got rid of his inner racing-car driver by spraying his team-mates from a jeroboam of champagne. ‘It’s just been an amazing few weeks for me,’ he reflected. ‘I feel so lucky for it to have come down to my match for the winning point.’ With that, he stopped and a little moisture came to his eyes. As ever, his team-mates were ready to help him out when necessary. As one, they took the opportunity to break into a round of applause. It was D-Day at Gleneagles and while there might never be one like this, there should be more great days for Donaldson in the years to come.","Europe retained the Ryder Cup with victory over the USA at Gleneagles .

"Chelsea are top of the Premier League but it is Southampton who have impressed me most so far. Chelsea strengthened their squad; Southampton had the heart ripped out of theirs. As well as selling Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren, Luke Shaw, Calum Chambers and Rickie Lambert, Southampton lost their chief executive Nicola Cortese and their manager Mauricio Pochettino. But they are once again punching above their weight — they sit fourth in the table before Saturday's tricky trip to Swansea — and their nightmare summer is fast becoming a distant memory. Graziano Pelle jumps for joy after opening the scoring for Southampton in their 4-0 victory over Newcastle . Southampton boss Ronald Koeman looks on during his side's comfortable victory at St Mary's . Saints sit in fourth place after picking up seven points from their opening four games . Their new signings have impressed me. Ronald Koeman is a bit of a journeyman, having been in charge with varying degrees of success at Valencia, Ajax, Benfica, PSV, Feyenoord, Vitesse and AZ Alkmaar but he is well respected and hugely knowledgeable. Bringing Graziano Pelle with him from Feyenoord looks a masterstroke. The Italian striker already has four goals this season and is not dissimilar to Lambert: big and powerful with a good touch. Behind him Dusan Tadic, brought in from Twente, looks a really good player. He spots people’s runs, plays clever through-balls and already has two assists to his name. Pelle and Tadic’s form has prompted me to watch a lot of Dutch football in the past fortnight. Players seem to get an excellent grounding over there. While those two have hit the ground running, Shaw has yet to play for Manchester United, Lallana has made a slow start at Liverpool and Lambert is stuck on the bench. Dusan Tadic, brought in from Twente, is another from the Dutch league who has hit form in England . Dejan Lovren (left) and Adam Lallana (second left) left Saints in the summer along with several others . Losing Lovren hurt. But two of Koeman’s back four in the win over Newcastle — Toby Alderweireld and Ryan Bertrand — have played in a Champions League final. Add Fraser Forster in goal and you can see why they are flourishing. Koeman’s team are already having more shots, making more passes and tackles and scoring more goals per game than Pochettino’s last season. So yes, they had the icing ripped off their cake this year but they’ve just replaced it with a thicker, tastier one. Another good call by Koeman was bringing in Sammy Lee as his assistant. I always found him very enthusiastic on England duty and he is receptive to foreign ideas, having worked with Gerard Houllier at Liverpool. Morgan Schneiderlin (second right) celebrates with team-mates after scoring on Saturday . There is still an English core to the squad too, which is crucial. Nathaniel Clyne is thriving at right back and is someone Roy Hodgson might like to look at. James Ward-Prowse is a huge talent in midfield and Jay Rodriguez is still to come back from injury. Those players and Morgan Schneiderlin will have found it devastating to see so many players leave in the summer but good results will change that. So what would be success for Southampton this season, a campaign in which many tipped them to go down? If they could match last season’s eighth-place finish, it would be remarkable; a minor miracle after selling so many stars. But don’t bet against them doing just that. PS . I’d demand more of Yaya Toure if I was playing with him. There are occasions when he doesn’t ask enough of himself to get back and defend. But a lot of it is about fitness. When I was at Arsenal it would take me five or six games to get match fit. Sol Campbell was a bit of a slow starter, too. Yaya Toure wasn't at his best on Wednesday night as Manchester City lost 1-0 to Bayern Munich . I think it’s the same with Yaya. He doesn’t look match sharp yet but he’s not far from it. He’s such a big, powerful player, so he asks a lot of his body when he uses that pace to get up and down the pitch. He could have worked harder against Bayern for the team but keeping him on the pitch will have helped — you build your fitness through the games.","Southampton sit fourth after two wins and a draw so far this season .

"The 15-year-old son of the leader of a Somali center in Missouri has died after he was intentionally plowed down by an SUV driver on Thursday afternoon. The driver, a man in his 30s, smashed into two boys as they climbed into a car outside the Somali Center of Kansas City at 5.30pm, severing the teenager's legs. The man then tried to drive off, but his vehicle was disabled by the crash so he fled on foot - with witnesses saying they saw him carrying a machete - but he was caught by police and arrested. His identity has not been released, but community members told Fox4 that he had been threatening them on Facebook for months and pulled a gun on a group last month 'because of their Muslim religion'. Scroll down for video . Crash: A 15-year-old boy was climbing into this parked car outside a Somali Center and mosque in Kansas City, Missouri on Thursday when a driver intentionally smashed into him, police said. He later died . 'A month or two ago he came to the Somali mall, two blocks from here. Things got bad, they started arguing and he pulled a gun,' said Abdul Mohamed, who knows the victim. The boy's legs were severed in the crash and he was rushed to Children's Mercy Hospital. Police said he lost a lot of blood. His family told Fox4 that the boy, who has not been identified, was brain dead and they decided to take him off life support on Thursday night. Another boy sustained non-life threatening injuries in the crash. There were also two children inside the targeted vehicle but they were unharmed. Sergeant Bill Mahoney told local news outlets that authorities believe the man intentionally targeted the group, in part because he was found with a machete and other weapons. 'It became pretty clear that this was not an accidental crash, there is a considerable amount of evidence that leads us to believe it was intentional,' he said. Scene: The crash unfolded outside the Somali Center, pictured, which the boy's father heads. Community members said that the driver had previously pulled a gun on people there for being Muslim . People at the scene told Fox that the boy was the son of the Somali Center's leader. Before news of the child's death, one woman, Khadra Dirr, said he was her nephew - 'a smart kid... a straight up A student'. 'Our family is very destroyed at what happened,' she said. 'He's a sweet, loving kid. He doesn't deserve this. I'm pretty sure it's a hate crime from things I've been hearing. I hope that someone brings him to justice.'

"The hunt for life elsewhere in the universe is now essentially a three-horse race between finding microbes in our solar system, signals from an intelligent race or clear signs of organisms in the atmosphere of an exoplanet. But one expert has claimed that, while the other two ‘horses’ might be important, finding intelligent life would have the most profound impact - because it might not be ‘life’ as we know it. Instead, she says that the first life we find might instead be a form of artificial intelligence - and it could indicate that humans, too, will one day be more machine than man. Dr Susan Schneider from The University of Connecticut says the first intelligent aliens we find might not be biological. Speaking to MailOnline she said advanced aliens might be machines (stock image shown). Humanity is already heading in this direction, she claimed . Speaking to MailOnline, Dr Susah Schneider, an Associate Professor in Philosophy at the University of Connecticut and author of several articles on alien life, explained her theory. She has been working on it with Dr Seth Shostak from Seti (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence). ‘What I was focusing on was a bit unusual, because I was arguing that the most advanced alien civilisation would actually be forms of AI,’ she explained. She adds that they might not be the life we find first, with the discovery of microbial life in the solar system being more likely. Professor Stephen Hawking has warned that humanity faces an uncertain future as technology learns to think for itself and adapt to its environment. Speaking at an event in London this week, the physicist told the BBC that: 'The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.' This echoes claims he made earlier in the year when he said success in creating AI 'would be the biggest event in human history, [but] unfortunately, it might also be the last.' He argued that developments in digital personal assistants Siri, Google Now and Cortana are merely symptoms of an IT arms race which 'pale against what the coming decades will bring.' But Professor Hawking noted that other potential benefits of this technology could also be significant, with the potential to eradicate, war, disease and poverty. ‘But it wouldn’t be the same as finding little green men,’ she added. ‘It wouldn’t be as Earth-shattering.’ What form that intelligent life might take, though, could come as somewhat of a surprise. ‘If you look at our own civilisation, people are becoming more immersed in computers, and we can already see signs of it in our own culture,' she continued. ‘Silicon is faster than brains. ‘The idea is that our brains are actually fairly slow; think about how hard it is to even remember a phone number. ‘AI researchers are doing quite well and most people in computer science think we are 50 years away from AI that is smarter than us. ‘So it looks like the next evolutionary step could be we are post-biological, we are sort of part computer in that people decide to “upload” themselves. ‘It sounds kind of crazy, and I don’t approve of this as a philosopher, but I think the thing is that that’s sort of the pattern a lot of people are starting to notice. ‘Aliens will be vastly older than us, so it looks like they may be sophisticated forms of AI that are far smarter than we are. ‘Kind of mind-blowing, isn’t it?’ Most regard the hunt for alien life as a three horse race at the moment between finding microbes in our solar system, signals from an intelligent race or clear signs of organisms in the atmosphere of an exoplanet (artist's illustration shown) Dr Schneider continued that she doesn’t necessarily think our transcendence to an AI-based race will be set in stone, and there will be some people who resist it. ‘In North America the Amish refuse the use of technology, and hopefully other people would think things through very quickly,’ she said. But she added she ‘wouldn’t be surprised if in 50 years we have the internet wired to our brains.’ Aside from a computational aspect, another limitation of our brains is their size and vulnerability, something that suggests a race more advanced than us would do away with them. ‘The idea kind of floating around Nasa and the Seti Institute is that the most sophisticated alien civilisations we encounter would not be biological. ‘Our brains are limited to the size of our skull, but a computer can take up an entire planet or city. ‘And if you need space travel, humans aren’t very durable. But with computers, you don’t have the same threat to worry about.’ 'The next evolutionary step could be we are post-biological,' said Dr Schneider. Recently experts in Washington DC discussed chances of finding alien life. Seti astromoner Dr Shostak said we 'could be the first' generation to know we are not alone . Such a discovery would suggest that the shift from biological to machine is something that takes place on other planets, and would ultimately indicate the direction humanity is going. And it would have a huge impact on our society, ‘like a science fiction novel come to life,’ according to Dr Schneider. ‘I think finding a more sophisticated form of life would be mind-blowing to most people. ‘Maybe they would just get back on with their lives after a week or so. But it would certainly shake them up.’ When, or if, such a discovery might occur, though, is anyone’s guess at the moment. Some people at Nasa and Seti think that alien life, perhaps just microbial and not intelligent, will be found in the next 20 years. But if intelligent life is one day found, the nature of it could have a huge impact on humanity today, and in the future. ‘In a way finding AI could be even more surprising than finding little green men,’ Dr Schneider concluded. Seti astromoner Dr Shostak says we 'could be the first' generation to know we are not alone.  Pictured is the surface of Mars, where microbial life might one day be found . Another method of finding life might be through an indirect observation in the atmosphere of an exoplanet using something like the James Webb Space telescope, illustration shown, which is set to launch  in 2019 . Earlier this year a researcher from the University of Cádiz in Spain says we shouldn't be looking for aliens - because we're not ready to meet team. Gabriel De la Torre claimed how his survey of students showed the general level of ignorance and influence of religion would leave us shocked if we made first contact. In the study he sent a questionnaire to 116 students in Spain, the US and Italy. De la Torre told MailOnline he used students because they 'will be the future politicians, scientists, the people in charge, so I wanted to know what their knowledge was.' The results were somewhat disconcerting for De la Torre. For example only 82 per cent of the students knew the first moon landing was in 1969. 'We're not ready to talk to extraterrestrials because global consciousness is not developed enough in the population,' he concluded. In the recent Astrobiology Symposium at the John W. Kluge Center at the Library of Congress in Washington DC, several experts in the field outlined their views on whether we are alone. Ultimately, the type of life we find first will dictate how we should react to its discovery. Seti astronomer Dr Seth Shostak explained that the hunt for life is a three horse race. First, there is the hunt for life - almost certainly microbial - in our own solar system. Next there is the possibility of detecting signs of life in the atmosphere of an exoplanet, perhaps a tell-tale signature in its atmosphere. And last, there is the work of Seti itself - which hunts the sky for signs of a signal from a distant intelligent race. It's unclear which of these methods will be first across the line - but whichever one is will have significant ramifications on Earth. 'There have been 10,000 generations of humans before us,' explained Dr Shostak. 'Ours could be the first to know [we are not alone].' Dr Shostak also went on to explain that he thought the first intelligent aliens we encounter might not be biological, but rather a form of artificial intelligence. With AI thought to become more advanced throughout this century, it's possible that just 150 years or so since the invention of radio, we will already have created artificial life. This would have important implications for the future of life on Earth. Some are of the belief that we will one day be able to 'emulate' our brains to achieve a form of immortality. 'The point is that, going from inventing radios to inventing thinking machines is very short - a few centuries at most,' Dr Shostak said. 'The dominant intelligence in the cosmos may well be non-biological.'","Dr Susan Schneider from The University of Connecticut says the first intelligent aliens we find might not be biological .

"Not even Mike Brown could find a way through, nor could Marland Yarde or Danny Care. Harlequins simply could not unlock the door. It was a ruthless lock-out – another triumph for the Wolf-pack. Saracens’ fabled defence left their London rivals without a point in front of their own supporters at The Twickenham Stoop last Friday night, while accumulating 39 of their own in a stunning Aviva Premiership mis-match. It was the latest herculean feat founded on Paul Gustard’s succinct instructions to the players, as they prepare to go into ‘monster’ mode. ‘”Go get ‘em”; that’s the message,’ he said. ‘”Go get ‘em; be aggressive”. People are confrontational in attack, so to counter that we have to be confrontational in defence. Rugby is a physical game of chess – you are fighting for space and territory. The task for a defence is to take space away from an attack, put them under pressure then hopefully you get turn-overs. Paul Gustard, defence and forwards coach for Saracens, is interviewed by Sportsmail's Chris Foy . Paul Gustard was a confrontational flanker at Leicester Tigers, London Irish and Saracens . Richard Wigglesworth breaks free with the ball during the London derby between Harlequins and Saracens . ‘The whole principle is, “Go get ‘em, we want the ball back”. In defence, the system requires clarity of thought because you need to make good decisions. But when the collision happens, you have to release the monster; you have to get angry and be physical to knock that person back.’ Saracens are a team who can win big games even when they have very little possession, such is their ability to soak up long spells of pressure. It was evident against Quins and notably last season in their Heineken Cup quarter-final victory over Ulster in Belfast. Their defence is founded on aggressive intent – on a collective mind-set and work-rate – but Gustard has elevated the whole concept by giving it an identity of its own. ‘The idea of the “Wolf-pack” just came out in a team meeting one day, in quite an organic way,’ he said. ‘We were talking about wanting to go out and hunt them, go out and get them, hunt them like a pack, and it just came into my head, “hunt them like a pack of wolves”. ‘I quite liked it and spoke with the boys about wolf howling – it was quite a vibrant meeting, as you can imagine! We decided to roll with it and I had some T-shirts knocked up. In the first year they said “raised by wolves”, next year we were “born to be wild” and next year it was “hungry like the wolf”. It has continued and it is an easy thing for the boys to talk about.’ Harlequins suffered an emphatic 39-0 defeat to Sarcacens on Friday night as Charlie Hodgson ran riot . Chris Ashton of Saracens crosses the line to score against Harlequins at the Twickenham Stoop . Innovation is something Saracens pride themselves on and it extends to coaching methods as well as a broader club out-look. Last year, Gustard brought a pair of wolves into training, which caught the players off-guard and certainly grabbed their attention. There may be similar stunts in the offing as he said: ‘We haven’t had any animals in for a while but we’ll try to amend that maybe! We were talking about a few ideas the other day. It’s never dull here; it’s never dull at all.’ While the pack mentality relies on a unified will to chase, tackle, pressurise and hold the line, there are those at the heart of it who make it all tick as defensive leaders. Gustard pinpoints three key men; Jacques Burger and Will Fraser – the two abrasive openside flankers – and Brad Barritt. The England centre leads Saracens at London Irish on Saturday and the defence guru delivered an emphatic endorsement of his worth to the club, in the knowledge that his virtues are sometimes overlooked in the endless debate about the best midfield combination for the national team. ‘For me, unequivocally, Brad Barritt is the best centre in England bar none,’ he said. ‘He should be one of the first names down on an England team-sheet. ‘We are very lucky to have him. He has an unbelievably low error rate, he is incredibly physical as a ball-carrier and he is the best defensive centre in Europe – I don’t think there is much debate about that. England and Saracens No 8 Billy Vunipola  is tackled by Harlequins hooker Joe Gray . England skipper Chris Robshaw of Harlequins is tackled by Richard Barrington of Saracens . ‘Not only is he a good defender, he is effective over the ball and gets us some key turn-overs, and his attacking game has grown. He’s got good, soft hands and puts in some deft little kicks, but that goes unnoticed because he has been pigeon-holed as not being a ball-player, which I think is unfair.’ In his own playing days, Gustard was an energetic, confrontational flanker at Leicester, London Irish and Saracens. He has taken his on-field persona into his work as a coach, to great effect. In June last year, he fulfilled a temporary role in Stuart Lancaster’s England set-up, while Andy Farrell was on Lions duty in Australia. It was a clear sign of his rising status and at some point, he would welcome a more permanent opportunity at Test level. ‘I was very fortunate that Stuart asked me to do it and that Saracens allowed me that opportunity,’ he said. ‘I had a great time. It was a challenge working with different players from different backgrounds, with different wants and needs, and difficult foibles and idiosyncrasies. ‘We did a good job, we got the players buying into what we were doing and we got the first series win in Argentina. I loved it and down the road, of course I would love it if that opportunity presented itself again, but at the moment they have a great coaching group. ‘At some stage I might get that chance but if it’s not with England, who knows? It might be with another country, or I might be head coach somewhere, or I might still be at Saracens, doing what we are doing.’ What they are doing today is trying to guard against any complacency after ‘nilling’ Harlequins. That shouldn’t be a significant danger because Irish beat them at Allianz Park last season and in Reading the season before, so the Exiles have proved more adept than most at breaking free from the Wolf-pack’s suffocating grip. Gustard remembers every try his side concede in forensic detail. They pain him. He wants to stop them, so he will send Barritt and Co out at the Madejski Stadium with those same simple but effective orders. ‘Go get ‘em’.","Saracens coach Paul Gustard reveals the secrets behind the Quins rout .

Gloves off: Mark Zuckerberg (left) has picked a fight with the boss of Apple by calling his recent criticism of the social network 'ridiculous'. The Facebook founder told Tim Cook (right) to make products like the iPhone and the iPad cheaper if he wanted to be more in touch with his consumers . The article in TIME magazine details how Zuckerberg is not content with having more than one billion Facebook users - he wants to connect the whole world. But picking a fight with Cook means that he has one less partner with which to do it. Zuckerberg said: 'A frustration I have is that a lot of people increasingly seem to equate an advertising business model with somehow being out of alignment with your customers… . '...I think it's the most ridiculous concept. 'What, you think because you're paying Apple that you're somehow in alignment with them? 'If you were in alignment with them, then they'd make their products a lot cheaper!' Cook has inherited Apple founder Steve Jobs' legacy as the company's mouthpiece in chief and has sharply criticised its rivals in the past. 'You think because you're paying Apple that you're somehow in alignment with them?, said Mark Zuckerberg in a recent interview. 'If you were in alignment with them, then they'd make their products a lot cheaper!' Picture dis Phil Schiller, Apple's Senior Vice President of Worldwide Product Marketing revealing iMac prices . He has said that he is 'offended' by the privacy breaches carried out by its arch rival Google and that he runs a 'very different company' to them. In September he attacked Facebook for harvesting information about users 'to sell to advertisers' Zuckerberg said that he spoke to Gates after he apparently criticised Internet.org, the home page for his global partnership for expanding Internet access. He said: 'I talked to him after that...I called him up and I was like, 'What's up, dude?' 'But he was misquoted, and he even corrected it afterward. He was like, 'No, I fully believe that this is critical.' Internet.org was unveiled earlier on this year and is a partnership between Zuckerberg and six major mobile phone companies. Its aim is to give everyone on the world Internet access and is developing advanced technologies to make it happen. Lawyers have claimed that each time a user with non-iTunes music tried to sync their phones and iPods, between 2007 and 2009 (Steve Jobs is pictured launching the 2009 iPod Nano), the tech firm urged them to restore their devices to factory settings. This is said to have been a deliberate move to wipe the rival files . For at least two years, Apple deleted songs from iPods that had been bought from rival music stores, according to accusations made in court. Each time an Apple user with non-iTunes music tried to sync their devices, between 2007 and 2009, the tech firm  urged them to restore the players to factory settings. And lawyers claim this was a deliberate move to wipe the rival files, and cause the users' music libraries to 'blow up.' Apple has been taken to court by individuals and businesses who accuse it of abusing its monopoly position in the digital music player market. The suit is being heard in a US district court in California, and is specifically looking into whether Apple tried to bolster its iPod and iTunes market between 2007 and 2009. The plaintiffs are seeking $350 million (£223 million) in damages, claiming that Apple’s behaviour forced them to pay more for songs and hardware. Apple is also accused of inflating the prices of its iPods by almost $350 million (£223 million). The group declined to comment on legal proceedings. Zuckerberg: 'We were thinking about the first decade of the company (Facebook), and what were the next set of big things that we wanted to take on, and we came to this realization that connecting a billion people is an awesome milestone, but there's nothing magical about the number 1 billion.

"Louis van Gaal has wound up Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola by claiming every player he speaks to would love to join Manchester United. Guardiola annoyed Van Gaal last week by saying stars like Arjen Robben, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Thomas Muller were too expensive for United and that the players did not want to go anyway. ‘If the player wants to stay, they stay,’ said Guardiola. The slight clearly hit the mark because on Saturday night Van Gaal, a former Bayern manager, hit back by saying: ‘It is not so interesting what he said. I think every player I have contacted wants to play for Manchester United. Louis van Gaal has claimed that every player he speaks to would love to join Manchester United . Pep Guardiola previously said stars like Arjen Robben and Thomas Muller were too expensive for United . ‘It is unbelievable that despite us not playing Champions League, the players are coming and willing to come. 'That is surprising but it is because of the greatness of this club and they believe in the project we have started now.’ Robben was linked with United before they signed Angel di Maria. Van Gaal also has close links to Bayern stars Muller and Holger Badstuber, whom he gave debuts to when he was at the Allianz Arena. The United manager’s comments suggest he either did not want to sign any of the Bayern squad or that the players would have gone to Old Trafford if Bayern had agreed. Asked if Guardiola was correct and that United had tried to buy Bayern players, Van Gaal said: ‘People always think what is said to the media is correct. But it is not.'

"Cristiano Ronaldo has become increasingly frustrated with life at Real Madrid, and could be interested in a sensational move back to Manchester United, according to the European champions' former president Ramon Calderon. The news of Cristiano Ronaldo's return to Manchester United will not come as a surprise to MailOnline readers. Rob Shepherd's Football Grapevine told you on Saturday that Ronaldo is interested in moving back to Old Trafford, but is demanding wages of £500,000-a-week. Real have started the season poorly, losing two of their first three La Liga matches, and Ronaldo is disappointed at the results and  the sale of key players, such as Angel di Maria and Xabi Alonso. Calderon, the man responsible for taking the Portugal forward to the Bernabeu, told talkSPORT: 'My impression is he is fed up with the policy of the current president [Florentino Perez].' Cristiano Ronaldo looked in fine fettle in Monday's training session, prior to Tuesday's match against Basel .

Manchester United (2003-09) - 290 games, 117 goals . Real Madrid (2009-) - 214 games, 229 goals . 'When he came [to Real Madrid] with [Arjen] Robben he thought he would be a good colleague for him in the team [but then he was sold]. '[Gonzalo] Higuain was sold and he didn't like that. Last year he thought it was a mistake to let [Mesut] Ozil leave and the last straw was selling Xabi Alonso and Angel di Maria this summer.' United are reportedly planning a spectacular offer to lure Ronaldo back to Old Trafford, and Calderon believes a return to Manchester is a distinct possibility. Calderon added: 'When I signed him in 2009, I remember he said he was grateful to Manchester United. 'He had a marvellous time there, he likes everything. It is a really great club.' The former United star  wants a staggering £500,000-a-week though if he is to re-join his old club. He spent six years at Old Trafford before making a world-record £80million move to Real. For the moment, however, he will look to start Los Blancos' Champions League defence with a win over Basle at the Bernabeu on Tuesday.

"The mother of a young Utah man who was killed by police this week said she thinks he wouldn't have been shot were her son white. . 'I'm in Saratoga Springs, cause it's a safe little community and they killed him,' Susan Hunt said on Friday. 'They killed my son because he's black. No white boy with a little sword would they shoot while he's running away.' 'Would they have done that to any white boy?' she added. Police say they shot Darrien Nathaniel Hunt, whose father is black and mother is white, on Wednesday while he was carrying what they have described as a Samurai sword. They were responding to a report of a suspicious person. This photo of Darrien Nathaniel Hunt being confronted by two officers was taken minutes before they shot and killed him . Susan Hunt said she thinks her 22-year-old son Darrien would never have been shot were he white like her . They have yet to release any other information about what prompted two Saratoga Springs police officers to shoot the 22-year-old and have provided few details about the crime scene, the Deseret News reported. 'Those stupid cops thought they had to murder over a toy,' Ms Hunt said. 'This is my baby. This is my family. And they ruined my family.' In a statement, a city spokesman denied race had anything to do with the officers' actions. Susan Hunt, middle, said Darrien had been going through some tough times emotionally since she left an abusive relationship three years ago . Officers stand at the scene of the shooting in Saratoga Springs. Police deny Hunt's race had anything to do with the shooting but have declined to provide more details about what prompted officers to shoot him . Friends and family of Hunt's have been leaving flowers, pictures and other objects at a makeshift memorial near where he was killed . 'We sympathize with Mr Hunt’s family during this difficult time. Any claim that our officers’ actions were a result of Mr Hunt’s race are completely unfounded and speculative. Our officers responded to a call for service and addressed the situation that was presented to them. The Utah County Attorney’s Office continues to investigate the incident.' Differing accounts from several eyewitnesses have confounded the confusion over what actually happened. Police say Hunt was carrying a Samurai sword but didn't reveal any other details about what prompted officers to shoot him . Most agree he had a three-foot sword, either in his hand or strapped to his back, but some described him as 'distressed', while others said he was 'totally calm', according to media reports. Hunt was walking near a cluster of shops, including a Panda Express, a gas station and a credit union. One of the witnesses  sent Ms Hunt a photo of police confronting her son outside the bank just before shots were fired. The pictures shows two officers standing on either side of Darrien Hunt, with no sword visible. At that point a shot was fired, according to the Hunt family's limited information, and more rang out as Mr Hunt ran toward the Panda Express, and the young man was struck and killed. 'I've been begging the police, why from the time I saw the pictures of you just standing by him with his hands to his side, does he end up seconds later with a bullet in him?' Ms Hunt said. 'And then if he's running, why you had to put in more bullets, and I don't even know how many? That's what I want to know. Would they have done that to any white boy?' Hunt reportedly ran toward this Panda Express during the confrontation with officers, when he was killed. The memorial was set up on the right side . Ms Hunt said her son was a tender young man who cared about the world and was emotionally confused after her family fled an abusive relationship. The letter at right was affixed to the small memorial at the scene of the incident . She described the sword as a Katana blade purchased at an Asian souvenir shop in the area and unable to cut anything. Ms Hunt said her son loved everyone and was deeply concerned about the environment and problems plaguing other parts of the world.. A boy in a man's body, Mr Hunt was still coming to terms with life after their family fled an abusive relationship three years ago, she said. He was born in Salt Lake City, and the family later moved to Kentucky and Virginia before returning to Utah. 'My son is a tender heart who would not hurt anybody. Just wanted to be loved. And he was so confused. He was abused his whole life,' she said. 'My son is a beautiful, bright-eyed, intelligent boy.' In January, Hunt took a plea in abeyance to a misdemeanor charge of assault, according to state court records, according to KSL.com. Ms Hunt said he should never have been charged with the incident because he was drunk and venting and only lightly pushed her. He also punched other teenagers in the house who were trying to control him. A growing makeshift memorial sprung up in front of the Panda Express on Friday, with balloons, flowers and pictures of Darrien. The Hunt family has set up a fund to help pay for funeral expenses. Donations can be made at any America First Credit Union under Darrien Hunt's name.","Susan Hunt says her son wouldn't have been shot by police were he white like her .

"It is a treasure trove of letters, notebooks, post cards and papers charting the life of one of the world's greatest ever scientists. A mammoth collection of 5,000 searchable documents from Albert Einstein's earlier years is being made freely available to the public on the internet. The archive ranges from charming letters to his future wife Mileva Marić after the birth of their first child to his battle to come to terms with fame and his stance as a pacifist in the wake of the First World War. Scroll down for video . An online collection of 5,000 Albert Einstein documents includes letters to his future wife Mileva Marić. The pair are pictured together . But it also highlights his prolific output as a physicist as well as lecture notes, extensive workings and a a telegram informing him he had won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1921 for the photoelectric effect. It includes documents about his most famous equation E=mc2, which said that the energy 'stored' in objects is equal to their mass multiplied by the speed of light squared. The transcribed and translated Digital Einstein Papers take readers on a journey through the life of the genius from 1879 to 1923, when he turned 44 - and anyone with an internet connection can now browse through the archive. It includes letters from a 22-year-old Einstein to his former classmate Marić, sent to her from Berne in Switzerland, in February 1902. It reveals his joy at learning of the birth of his daughter. Writing to his 'beloved sweetheart', he asks of baby Lieserl: 'Is she healthy and does she already cry properly? What kind of little eyes does she have? Whom of us two does she resemble more? Who is giving her milk? Is she hungry? And so she is completely bald. I love her so much and I don't even know her yet! 'Couldn't she be photographed once you are totally healthy again? Will she soon be able to turn her eyes toward something?' The archive includes love letters Einstein (right) wrote to Elsa Löwenthal (left). The pair married after his first wife granted a divorce . In 1903, he wrote to his friend Michele Besso that he was living a 'very pleasant, cozy life with my wife'. 'She takes excellent care of everything, cooks well, and is always cheerful,' he wrote. The pair would go on to have two sons but Einstein later began an affair with his cousin, Elsa Löwenthal. In one letter to her on May 7 1912, he writes: 'Both of us are poor devils, each shackled to his unrelenting duties. I cannot tell you how sorry I am for you, and how much I would like to be something to you. 'But if we give in to our affection for each other, only confusion and misfortune will result. You know this only too well. He continues: 'I love you. I would be happy if I were allowed to walk a few steps at your side even if only from time to time, or if I could otherwise rejoice in being close to you.' He later married Löwenthal, who had children of her own, after Marić granted a divorce. In other letters Einstein describes how fame was affecting his personal life, writing that 'The postman is my archenemy, I cannot shake myself loose from his slavery' The transcribed and translated collection shows how Einstein was a prolific writer of letters and postcards. Pictured above is a post card, from a separate archive, that he once wrote to his wife Elsa . In other letters he describes how fame was affecting his personal life, writing that 'The postman is my archenemy, I cannot shake myself loose from his slavery'. And the scientist, who died at the age of 76, sets out his pacifist stance following the horrors of the First World War writing to hi friend Carl Herman Unthan: 'I must admit that it always pains me when the few little blossoms that grew in my flowerbed must suffer by being used to decorate the banner of nationalism. Revealing his excitement about the birth of his first child in 1902, he wrote to Mileva Marić: . ‘I love her so much and I don’t even know her yet! Couldn’t she be photographed once you are totally healthy again? In a 1912 love letter to Elsa Lowenthal, the woman he was having an affair with, he wrote: . ‘Both of us are poor devils, each shackled to his unrelenting duties. I cannot tell you how sorry I am for you, and how much I would like to be something to you. Explaining his hopes for peace after the First World War in a letter in April 1920, he said: . ‘I am a pacifist and, in these times of hate, am steadily intent on encouraging reconciliation’ 'For I am a pacifist and, in these times of hate, am steadily intent on encouraging reconciliation.' Having documented the first 44 years of his life, the team behind the project plans to add more volumes to the archive as they are compiled and printed. The 14th volume, with more than 1,000 documents, is set to be released in January and will be digitised at a later date. The website is a collaboration involving the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), Princeton University Press and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. It includes both the German originals and the English translations. Diana Kormos-Buchwald, director of the Einstein Papers Project at Caltech is quoted by the Los Angeles Daily News as saying: 'This is an ongoing project. We have reached his 44th birthday. 'People from China to South America and India and many other places where they don’t have access to these volumes will be able to access these materials. 'These volumes are usually of interest to specialists, and we hope to widen the interest considerably.'","Online archive contains 5,000 documents from Albert Einstein's early life .

"Every day painkillers and anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen that are flushed out into the environment are stunting the growth of important food crops, new research suggests. Scientists have assessed the impact of a range of commonly used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication on edible crops like lettuce and radish. They found that the drugs could change the way the roots and stems of the plants grow in the first few weeks after germinating. Some of the drugs caused radishes to grow shorter roots, which may impact on the size and quality of the food . In some cases the drugs suppressed growth and led to roots being shorter while others enhanced the growth of leaves. They could also alter the way the crops took up water. More than 30 million of these drugs are prescribed across the world every day and find their way into the environment. Dr Clare Redshaw, who led the study at the European centre for environmental and human health at the University of Exeter, said that the findings raised serious questions about how the medication we use is altering the environment around us. Long-term monitoring by the British Trust For Ornithology shows starling numbers have fallen by two-thirds in Britain since the early Eighties. The RSPB says the starling is now listed as a ‘bird of high conservation concern’. While the charity admits the cause of the decline in the UK is not clear, Dr Kathryn Arnold, an ecologist from the University of York, who has been studying the effects of our Prozac habit on starlings, suggests the anti-depressant could be partly to blame. She says the birds are ingesting fluoxetine — the drug’s active ingredient — by eating earthworms that thrive at sewage works. The level of fluoxetine in these worms is tiny, around four per cent of the equivalent average dose given to humans. But research shows even this minute dose can have a profound effect on the starlings’ brains. Dr Arnold fed worms containing the same concentration of the drug to 24 captive starlings and monitored their behaviour over six months. The experiment, on BBC2’s Autumnwatch, which is broadcast over four days this week, found that the birds suffered side-effects similar to those experienced by humans taking Prozac. Antidepressants have also been found to produce impacts on male crayfish, which become more aggressive and kill large number of females. Environmental researchers have in the past warned that hormones like estrogen from contraceptive drugs are having a devastating impact on fish and amphibian. Now the latest work suggests that many other common drugs are also having unexpected impacts on the environment and the food we eat. Dr Redshaw said: ‘These are some of the most widely used drugs in the world, yet we know very little about their effects on flora and fauna. ‘The roots and stems seemed to be the most affected in the plants we looked at, but some of the drugs had opposing effects in different plants.’ For example, diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug used to treat arthritis and migraine headaches, seemed to suppress the growth of radishes while enhanced lettuce growth. By comparison, Ibuprofen exposure delayed the opening of lettuce leaves and had a significant influence on early root development in lettuce but enhanced the growth of radish roots. ‘We only ran these experiments for a number of weeks but if we continued for several months we may see the affects change,’ said Dr Redshaw. ‘Early development is a crucial time for plants and it is likely we would see continuing impacts in these plants. ‘Clearly it is not catastrophic, otherwise all out fields would be empty, but it is clear these drugs are changing the way plants grow.’ Dr Redshaw and her colleague Dr Wiebke Schmidt studied how six different non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs changed the germination and growth of lettuce and radish plants. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen can escape into the environment through waste water and when old unused drugs are are thrown away in to landfill, which could be having a major impact on plants . Although the researchers from Exeter University only tested the changes in lettuce and radishes, they fear painkillers and other drugs may also cause changes in the way other crops and wild plants develop . They looked at ibuprofen, diclofenac, naproxen, tolfenamic acid, meclofenamic acid and mefenamic acid - which are all used to treat arthritis, migraines or menstrual pains. They found that each of the drugs altered the way the plants photosynthesised, their overall size, their root and shoot length and how they took up water. The findings, which are published in the Journal of Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety, emphasis the need to find new ways to remove medication from waste water. Dr Redshaw said although they only studied the impact of the drugs in two plants, it was clear they could also affect other crops. She added that previous work she had conducted showed that many medications are absorbed by crop plants, which leads to them being eaten again by humans. Dr Redshaw said: ‘Many drugs we use are designed to be very stable which means they are resistant and can cycle around in the food chain. Ibuprofen delayed the opening of lettuce leaves and altered the way the roots grew in early development . The researchers grew lettuce and radishes from seeds while exposing them from different medications . 'The use of these drugs is rising in western and developed countries because of the aging population demographic. 'Clearly these drugs could also be having a combined affect  on plants as they will not just be exposed to a single drug or pollutant in the environment. ‘There are some 3,000 pharmaceuticals licensed for use in the UK. The next phase in our work will be to look at these mixture effects.’ The work builds on concerns that pharmaceuticals in the environment are posing a growing threat to human health and wildlife. Overuse of antibiotics, which escape into the environment, are thought to be driving the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria. A recent special issue of the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B warned the risk posed by pharmaceuticals to wildlife needed to be better explored. In freshwater habitats, for example, where drugs tend to be most commonly found, around 75% of fish and amphibians had been lost. Other research has also found that vultures in India are being wiped out by an anti-inflammatory drug given to cattle. Dr Kathryn Arnold, an environmental research fellow at the University of York who edited the issue said: ‘With thousands of pharmaceuticals in use globally, they have the potential to have potent effects on wildlife and ecosystems. ‘We believe that it is time to explore emerging challenges.’","Common medications for arthritis and migraine altered root development .

The advert, for the Walmart Family Mobile, shows a man handing a cellphone to his overjoyed daughter who squeals and wraps her arms around her father, hugging him tightly . The commercial first aired over the summer, but it appears to have struck a nerve in the wake of the high-profile death of Eric Garner, who died after being held in a chokehold by NYPD officer Daniel Palenteo. In a video of the incident last July,  the 43-year-old father could be heard yelling, 'I can't breathe, I can't breathe', as he was pushed to the ground. In the wake of the grand jury decision not to indict Palenteo, those three words have been used by demonstrators nationwide as a rallying cry to protest Garner's death. The Walmart commercial shows a father buying a cellphone for his daughter who is overjoyed . The girl wraps her arms around her father's neck while he joking mouths: 'I can't breathe' 'Albeit, it's his daughter and he's joking about choking', he said, before adding, 'the timing of the video is not good'. Other viewers took to Twitter to suggest that Walmart might want to re-think  the commercial in the light of the past few days' events. One commentator tweeted: '#walmart did you really just air a commercial in NY where a little black girl has her arm around her dads neck and he says #icantbreathe.' Viewers took to Twitter to suggest that Walmart might want to re-think the commercial in the light of the past few days' events . Walmart was quick to respond and reassure viewers that the commercial would be tweaked . Another wrote: 'Ad itself is fine, just timing of events no corp could predict. Happened to see it for first time this morning.' Walmart was quick to respond and reassure viewers that the commercial would be tweaked.

"This week the 2014 UK Lingerie Awards honoured the brightest stars in the women's underwear market at a star-studded ceremony. A glance at the winners (scroll down for a full list) may give British men help on where they should head to buy Christmas lingerie presents - but how do they decide on specifics? It's a staple gift but many men are clueless when it comes to buying underwear for their other halves, opting for unsuitable bras, knickers, basques and suspender belts. Scroll down for videos . Seductive: Saffron robe (l) and Iva babydoll basque (r) both by Giles Deacon for Ann Summers . Racy lace: Gossard prove why they were named the UK's 'Favourite Lingerie Brand of the Year' with this Vintage Glamour Slip, £49 . Almost one in four women (24 per cent) claim they been given sexy underwear gifts from a partner that they have never worn. And most women say it's because it was the wrong size, uncomfortable or too skimpy. One in five wear the gift just once before hiding it away. Sex appeal: Chantelle were named 'Lingerie Brand of the Year' thanks to designs like this Palazzo Push-up bra, £68, Waist Cincher, £65, Tanga briefs - £36 . Comfort and style: Opera Half cup bra £60, and Shorty briefs £36  (l) and Palazzo half cup T-shirt bra, £66, and Shorty briefs £38 (r) by Chantelle . However well over a third (39 per cent) of recipients of undesirable undergarments admitted they had not told the men in their lives their true feelings about the gift for fear of 'hurting their feelings'. Four out of ten of men questioned said they were embarrassed to enter lingerie departments and just over a third (35 per cent) wrongly quoted their partners size when asked. The poll of Debenhams customers also found that while two thirds of women had been given lingerie at some time as a present, only 26 per cent said their partners had bought something they really liked. Women also expressed concern that risqué underwear would be a more popular gift this year because of the publicity surrounding the much awaited film adaptation of Fifty Shades of Grey due to hit the cinema on Valentine's Day next year. The two sexes have very differing tastes. Bright red was a turn off for more than two out of three women but this subtler version of the shade can't fail to impress: Tutti Rouge Beatrice Rouge Noir, bra, 28, knickers, £14 (l) and Gossard SuperBoost Lace Foil Padded Plunge Bra - £32, Thong - £14, Suspender - £20 (r) Be daring: Gossard Temptation Deep V Bra, £39, Waspie Suspender, Thong - £24 . F&F Sequin Soft Bra £15 and High Waisted Knickers £10 (l) and Angelina Plunge Bra £12 and Mini Knickers £5 . Find underwear to compliment her figure: Pictured on the model is Janet Reger, Reger Noir at Debenhams, bra £28, knickers £12.50, and suspender belt £20 . Sharon Webb, head of lingerie buying and design at Debenhams, says: . Fishnet style lingerie, thongs or cut-out knickers were disliked by 75 per cent of women, although 54 per cent of men think a thong is sexy. Among men under 35 years old, this figure rose to 78 per cent. Bright red was a turn off for more than two out of three women (68 per cent) while six out of ten men (61 per cent) said it was their favourite underwear colour, followed by black (32 per cent). Men also liked the classic boudoir image of matching lace, suspenders, sequins, bodices and stocking all in the brightest colours. However, women said they do like to wear sensual underwear saying it made them feel more desirable and confident, with eight out of 10 saying that they owned romantic sets they brought out for special occasions. But they added they liked underwear to be practical and able to be worn in everyday life, not just the bedroom. Women also like softer fabrics in more understated tones and lingerie which was flattering, but also comfortable.

In an attempt to prevent men making disastrous choices this Christmas, Debenhams, who were crowned the UK's Favourite Retailer at the Lingerie Awards, are trialling its first Lingerie Couple's Clinic at its flagship Oxford Street store. The project aims to help men find the perfect lingerie present by familiarising them with desirable choices that also help make their partner feel confident, comfortable and positive. The first ever clinic took place last night, December 4, where experts were on hand to advise on fit and style plus matched up what one partner likes to look at with what the other might enjoy wearing. Men can  attend the Clinic without their partners for one-to-one expert advice on picking the perfect underwear gift to surprise the woman in their life. Bluebella Vivienne Basque - £48, and the Caterina Bra - £29 with matching suspender belt and knickers . Sharon Webb, Head of Debenhams lingerie says: 'There are many tips that we can pass on to men to help ensure any lingerie they buy pleases the women in their lives as well as themselves, but it is important that they get the basics right such as buying the right size. 'This is where the Lingerie Couple's Clinic will really help in identifying the different brands that will fit a particular female body shape and in a style and colour that makes the wearer feel both comfortable and confident. 'We know that many men don't feel at ease in lingerie departments so our first 'clinic' will be in a relaxed environment where people can get one to one attention and hopefully leave with a gift they know will be well-received.'

"A historic house Sarasota, Florida, is up for sale for $1 – and the owners say even that’s negotiable. But there is a major catch. The new owner will have to move the house to another location. Scroll down for video . What a steal: This four-bedroom, 2,300-square-foot home in Sarasota's most historic neighborhood has been put on the market for a $1 . Read the fine print: The catch is that whoever buys the home will have to spend about $130,000 to move it to a different location . Old-school charm: A couple from Atlanta bought the property in June for $605,000 sight unseen, but quickly concluded that it was too old-fashioned for them . A house divided: The house will have to be cut in half and reassembled at the new location because it's wider than the surrounding streets . Idyllic: The home at 1215 Pomelo Avenue was built in the 1920s on a tree-lined street in Sarasota . The Sarasota Herald-Tribune reported the cost could run as high as $130,000 with a new foundation and utility hookups. The house will have to be cut in half and reassembled at the new location because it's a bit wider than the surrounding streets. House mover Brett Johnson told the newspaper the second level of the home will also have to be removed before relocation. So, the house is basically free. But it's not. Robert and Julie Henry, the current homeowners, plan to build a different, more modern house on the lot . The couple have received an offer from a buyer who was interested in breaking apart the house for parts, but they said, 'no' Robert and Julie Henry, a couple from Atlanta, bought the property in June for $605,000 sight unseen. But when they drove down to Sarasota to take a look at their new digs, they concluded that it was too old-fashioned for their taste. The home at 1215 Pomelo Avenue was built in the 1920s. It features four bedrooms, three bathrooms, hardwood floors, a wood-burning fireplace, a study, a formal dining room and a sun deck with a hot tub. ‘It is speculated that this home, once deemed the ""farm house"", was part of a group of parcels originally owned by Charles Elliott Abbe, Sarasota's first postmaster,’ reads the property’s description on the real estate site Zillow.com. The home's most recent owner was Robin Speidel, the grandson of noted Sarasota judge Lynn L. Silvertooth who moved into the house back in 1945, and for whom the Sarasota County Judicial Center is named. Rather than tearing down the handsome historic home situated on a tree-lined street in the Pomelo Park section of Sarasota, the Henrys came up with the idea to put it on the market for less than the price of a cup of coffee. Interiors: The handsome four-bedroom three-bath home has hardwood floors throughout . Split up: The house has two floors, but the second story will have to be disassembled for the big move . Creature comforts: The house features a wood-burning fireplace, a study, a formal dining room and a sun deck with a hot tub. Sweetening the deal: Bob Henry has even offered to throw in their high-end Viking stove free of charge . Realtor Barbara Sassan May, with Michael Saunders & Company, says the complications have already dissuaded a few potential owners. One would-be buyer offered the Henrys to take the residence off their hands and break it apart for building materials, but the couple declined. The Henrys want the house moved by the end of the year so they could start building their new, more modern, home on the lot, reported WFTV. If they fail to find a buyer willing to relocate the dwelling, they will be forced to demolish it and salvage whatever materials they can. To sweeten the deal, Bob Henry has even offered to throw in their high-end Viking stove free of charge.","The four-bedroom, three-bath, 2,300-square-foot house in Pomelo Park section of Sarasota, Florida, was built in 1920s .

"The bank that took control of the Newtown home where Sandy Hook Elementary School shooter Adam Lanza lived burned everything inside to ensure nothing could be sold as as murder memorabilia. All personal belongings and furniture were removed from the colonial-style home and incinerated, before Hudson Savings Bank of New Jersey handed ownership of the property to the Connecticut town. Twenty-year-old Lanza shot his mother Nancy Lanza dead at the house before killing 20 first-graders and six educators at Sandy Hook  in December 2012. He then killed himself at the school as police arrived. Scroll down for video . Belongs to Newton: The Colonial-style home where Newtown school shooter Adam Lanza lived with his mother now belongs to the town . 'There is nothing left but the light fixtures; we burned everything from the carpets to any personal effects left behind,' William LaCalamito, a senior vice president for Hudson Savings Bank of New Jersey told the Hartford Courant. 'We didn't want anything from that house showing up for sale on eBay two years from now.' California real estate expert Randall Bell, who has been involved in the sale or disposal of notorious properties including the Sharon Tate home and O.J. Simpson's house, was hired by the bank. 'It was a sad situation,' he told the newspaper. 'There was tons of stuff in that house. There were a lot of Adam Lanza's possessions still there and that stuff needed to be gone.' Twenty-year-old Lanza shot his mother Nancy Lanza to death at the house before killing 20 first-graders and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December 2012 . The bank took over ownership of the home in September after Nancy Lanza's other son and sole heir, Ryan Lanza, sold it earlier this year. The property, built in 1998, was assessed at more than $500,000 and had a fair market value of at least $360,000. But the home now belongs to the town after local officials agreed to buy it for $1. Adam Lanza shot his mother Nancy Lanza at the property, which now belongs to Newtown . 'It certainly would have been a hard sell, but it probably could have been sold eventually,' Mr Bell said. 'But for this community, that was not the right thing to do.' The bank is absorbing a mortgage of nearly $400,000 that Nancy Lanza had on the home, and is allowing Newtown to do what it wants with the property. Mary Ann Jacob, head of the Newtown Legislative Council, says the council voted on Wednesday to accept ownership of the house. Jacob says any decision on how to use the property would come later and would involve the Board of Selectmen. 'Owning the house now gives the town control over what happens, and that was very important to us because of the tragedy,' Newtown First Selectman Patricia Llodra told Reuters. 'Those discussions will start in January.' Some Newtown residents have said they would like to see the property torn down and replaced with a park or nature preserve. Ms Llodra said requests by families of the victims that the house be demolished would be taken into account and the town was 'strongly considering' tearing down the house. Sandy Hook Elementary School has already been razed to the ground. Speaking to the Hartford Courant, Mr LaCalamito added that the Hudson Bank went 'the extra mile' because of the situation, but is now done with the property. 'It's up to them to do whatever they choose,' he said. 'We wish the town nothing but the best.'","The property where Lanza lived with his mother now belongs to Newtown .

"Manchester United new boy Daley Blind has revealed that Louis van Gaal can be so honest to his players that it's 'frightening'. The Dutch defender made his Red Devils debut on Sunday against QPR after sealing a £14million move from Ajax this summer.

I have really learned a lot from Van Gaal and I like working under him. ‘He is not frightening, he is just honest. That can be frightening, but I like it. Despite his background as a defender, Blind was deployed in a deep-lying midfield role on Sunday and impressed the Old Trafford faithful as he helped United to a 4-0 win against QPR. Speaking of his new role, Blind added: ‘I think he can make me a better player in terms of positioning, where to stand and tactics in games because midfield is an important position to play and I hope I can get better at it every day.’ Blind started in a deep-lying midfield role against Queens Park Rangers on Sunday .","Daley Blind reveals Louis van Gaal's honesty can be 'frightening'

"Fabian Delph made his England debut last week against Norway, the first Aston Villa player since November 2011 to represent the Three Lions when Darren Bent made the last of his 13 caps in a 1-0 win over Sweden. Delph should earn plenty more after an assured performance in Switzerland on Monday. Tom Cleverley made the last of his 13 England caps in November last year in a 1-0 defeat to Germany, and may struggle to find another. The men best equipped to retain Delph's form and regain Cleverley's are Roy Keane and Paul Lambert . Scroll down for VIDEOS... Roy Keane (right) joined boss Paul Lambert as Aston Villa's assistant manager in the summer . Fabian Delph (left) and Tom Cleverley (right) should partner each other in Villa's midfield this season . Villa appointed the former Manchester United midfielder as Lambert's assistant in the summer, a desperate attempt to bring fight and passion to a side that stuttered to 15th in the previous two seasons. Silverware is a distant memory at Villa Park - 1996 was the last time fans saw it - but the managerial partnership have 28 major wins between them, including two European Cups. Delph and Cleverley would struggle to find two better midfield role models. Every training session should be an education for the pair; both Keane and Lambert captained multiple title-winning teams and their national side from the heart of the pitch, . Lambert played over 600 times in Scotland and Germany, winning numerous titles . Keane lifts the Champions League with Manchester United in 1999, despite being banned for the final . There was some trepidation over Keane's move to the Midlands. Keane would either lift Villa or sink them further, depending on what mood he was in and how he would work with Lambert. But one positive of the move was his potential influence on a middle core that had taken a beating in the last two years, a huge step down from the midfield of James Milner, Stylian Petrov, Gareth Barry and Ashley Young of four years previous. Delph has already gone from strength to strength this season, continuing his form from the past 18 months and finally turning Hodgson's head enough for a call up. He doesn't play quite like Keane and Lambert did; he is more athletic, frantic but superb on the ball, and likes to leave his foot in. Keane's influence on the 1999 campaign was huge, and is seen as one of United's best ever midfielders . Keane lifts the Premier League trophy in 1999 (left) as Lambert lifts the Champions League in 1997 . Keane will know what Cleverley went through at Old Trafford; he will have seen numerous youngsters come through the ranks and fail to live up to the hype. But Villa's assistant will also be aware that both Hodgson and David Moyes saw something in the 25-year-old when it seemed 99 per cent of the country didn't. He will strive, alongside Lambert, to turn that promise into a reality. Villa's other midfield men, 24-year-old Ashley Westwood, who was playing in League Two just over two years ago, and Colombian Carlos Sanchez, brought in from Elche in the summer, will not be neglected. Cleverley in Villa training this week, with Delph in the background after returning from England duty . Delph is on the rise in Roy Hodgson's eyes, while Cleverley may struggle to get back into the England side . Westwood in particular, who may lose his place in the starting XI to Cleverley, will need to show he can take the leap from being a reliable midfielder to a commanding influence on a game, and who better to learn from than the men with over 1,300 senior appearances between them. The Keane and Lambert partnership may have sounded like a ticking time bomb at the start of the season, but they seem to have welcomed each other with open arms (despite the video below) and Villa have enjoyed a fine start to the season. The next five games - against Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City and Everton - will test their resolve.","Tom Cleverley joined on loan from Manchester United last week .

"John Hatfield, 69, died in May last year after suffering a cardiac arrest in hospital when staff failed to give him a blood transfusion . A 69-year-old man died in his hospital bed after doctors failed to give him a life-saving blood transfusion, despite ordering it five hours earlier. John Hatfield, from Heworth in York, was admitted to hospital on May 1 last year. He was quickly diagnosed as suffering a gastrointestinal bleed, a side effect of taking the blood-thinning drug, Warfarin. An order was placed with York Hospital's blood bank for a transfusion, within one hour of Mr Hatfield's admission to A&E at 4.55pm. But the decision was taken to delay the procedure, and transfer the 69-year-old to the acute medical ward. The father-of-two arrived at the ward at 10.25pm, already suffering chest pains and heart palpitations, but an inquest heard he was neither monitored by a nurse, nor visited by a doctor. Nearly three hours later, after being alone on the ward, the low volume of blood in his body triggered a cardiac arrest. Dr Hatfield never regained consciousness and died seven days later on May 8, after his life-support machine was switched off. The inquest heard Dr Hatfield was being monitored for long-term treatment of Atrial Fibrillation, a common condition which causes an irregular heart rhythm and affects around one in 20 adults over the age of 65. His condition was under regular review and was well controlled by the Warfarin medication. The York Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust admitted liability. Today, following the inquest into Dr Hatfield's death on Wednesday, his family called for lessons to be learned to prevent the same mistake being repeated. His wife Madeline Hatfield, 71, said: 'We simply cannot conceive how we could lose John so suddenly. 'One day he is at home happy, fit and able, the next day on a life support machine. 'To find out that he could have, and should have, easily survived leaves us devastated. 'In our opinion, it is not down to a lack of systems. It is that the systems and protocols were wholesale ignored. 'John was not failed by one member of staff - he was failed repeatedly by everyone who was responsible for his care. Dr Hatfield, pictured with his wife Madeleine, was suffering a gastronintestinal bleed caused by medication he was taking. Within an hour of being admitted doctors ordered a blood transfusion to replace the blood he had lost. But  eight hours later he suffered a cardiac arrest, after medics failed to carry out the procedure . 'I would like to thank the Coroner for taking the time to investigate what happened to John - it has taken our family over a year of meetings, including insisting that the hospital issue a revised Serious Untoward Incident Report to replace what we felt was a flawed one. 'I hope lessons are learned to prevent this happening to others in future.' Katie Warner, medical negligence expert at Irwin Mitchell, said Dr Hatfield's family found it very difficult to hear the coroner rule his death was avoidable. She said: 'The past year has been horrendous for the family and for them to hear that John's death was completely avoidable has left them devastated once again. 'The incident raises a number of issues which the Trust needs to ensure it addresses in terms of observations of patients and training for its staff so that the same thing cannot happen in future. 'The Trust has carried out an internal investigation and made a number of recommendations in respect of treatment to be provided going forward, the family are keen to ensure that these recommendations are implemented.' The York Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, which runs York Hospital, pictured, admitted liability for Dr Hatfield's death and has apologised to his family . A spokesperson for York Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust said: 'We accept the Coroner's findings and the conclusion of this inquest. 'We are sincerely sorry for the circumstances surrounding Dr Hatfield's death, and have already provided a full apology to his family. 'An investigation was undertaken by the Trust and, following this, a number of changes have already been made to our processes within acute medicine. 'As demand for our acute services increases we have an even greater responsibility to ensure that our systems and processes are resilient to these pressures and that they fully support our staff in delivering safer care. 'We have reviewed the rotas to ensure that they better reflect our capacity and demand, and we have also reviewed staffing including the introduction of Acute Care Practitioners onto the Acute Medical Unit. 'We have also introduced new measures to enable staff to assess and identify those patients that are most at risk. 'These actions have been implemented since the outcome of the Trust's investigation following Dr Hatfield's death, and will reduce the risk of another incident of this nature taking place.'","John Hatfield died at York Hospital in May last year after cardiac arrest .

"A mother-of-three quit smoking to pay for a tummy tuck operation after being left with two stone of excess skin after weight loss surgery. After losing more than 11 stone after the gastric bypass, Michelle Lee wanted to show off her new svelte body. But the 47-year-old couldn't buy any new clothes because of a mass of unsightly overhanging stomach fat, known as an 'apron' of skin. Scroll down for video . Michelle Lee, 47, quit smoking 20 cigarettes a day to raise £1,000 for a tummy tuck operation. She had been left with unsightly excess skin after losing weight following a gastric bypass procedure in 2011. Here, she is pictured after the tummy tuck procedure . After losing more than 11 stone, Mrs Lee wanted to splash out on a new wardrobe, but a huge 'apron' of overhanging skin meant she had to wear her old clothes . Determined to find a solution, Mrs Lee, from Dartford, Kent, decided to quit smoking to pay for an apronectomy. This a tummy tuck procedure which removes the excess skin from the abdomen. After saving up more than £1,000 for the operation, a surgeon removed almost two stone of loose skin and fat from her midriff, in the biggest tummy tuck he had had ever seen. The surgeon even said the volume of excess skin was so big, he required help from a colleague to remove it. Mrs Lee is now ecstatic about her flatter stomach. She said: 'I feel like a new woman after the surgery. 'I'd lost so much weight all I wanted to do was buy nice clothes and show off my slim body. 'But whenever I went to try something on, my stomach would hang out of the bottom of a skirt. 'It was embarrassing and meant I wore baggy tops and trousers to cover it up. 'It really got me down but I was determined to make a change. 'After six months of not smoking I'd saved the money to get the surgery and now I couldn't be happier.' Losing weight will be the answer to many people's prayers. But they may not realise dramatic weight loss can have a deeply distressing side-effect: excess skin. This hidden downside of losing weight occurs as a result of damage to the deeper layers of skin, the dermis, which contains two proteins: elastin, which helps it retract, and collagen, for strength. When the skin is stretched too much through weight gain, these proteins tear and break, resulting in a loss of elasticity and strength. Unfortunately, while losing weight causes the fat cells to lose their fat, the skin cannot retract. It is linked unpleasant health problems, from infections to back pain. Many patients patients develop an 'apron' of skin around the abdomen, and loose skin under the arms, chest and inner thighs. This excess skin can cause a range of medical problems. One of the most common is intertrigo — a bacterial, fungal, or viral infection that occurs often due to the difficulty in keeping these folds of excess skin clean and dry. Patients also find the folds of skin make it difficult to exercise. At her heaviest, she weighed 25 stone and suffered high blood pressure and peripheral vascular disease. This is where a build up of fatty deposits in the arteries restricts blood supply to leg muscles, causing pain. In 2011, she underwent a gastric bypass and over the next year lost 11 and a half stone. She wanted to show off her thinner frame and splash out a new wardrobe, but found buying clothes a nightmare because of her overhanging skin. Mrs Lee said: 'I weighed half as much as before, but my belly looked the same size. 'I would walk into shops and pick up these gorgeous tops and skirts, but when I tried them it wouldn't cover the overhang. 'Although I wanted to throw them out, I had to carry on wearing my old clothes. 'When I should have been looking forward to my new, lighter life I couldn't as I was still so conscious about my stomach.' After two years of being upset about her figure, Mrs Lee decided to take action and looked into cosmetic surgery. As she was unable to work due to her peripheral vascular disease, she knew she would have to sacrifice something to save the money. She quit her 20 cigarette-a-day habit - which cost £6 - and put her savings into a kitty. Finally at the end of October 2014, with a bit of help from her kids, she had saved up the £1000 to pay for her apronectomy and liposuction. She flew to Poland and had her surgery through Europe Surgery, having read rave reviews from customers. During the apronectomy the chief surgeon, Adam Kalecinski, removed 1st 4lbs of skin and liposuction sucked 3litres of fat, weighing 7lbs, from her stomach. Miss Lee travelled to Poland for the apronectomy operation, where two surgeons removed nearly two stone of excess skin and fat. She is pictured here after the procedure . Mrs Lee said: 'I was so happy to have lost the weight. But whenever I went to try something on, my stomach (pictured) would hang out of the bottom of a skirt' She now feels 'like a new woman'. I've finally been able to go out and buy the clothes I wanted to when I had the gastric bypass' Mrs Lee is now 'delighted' with her figure. She said: 'I feel like a completely different woman now. ''I've finally been able to go out and buy the clothes I wanted to when I had the gastric bypass. 'I wasn't worried about going out to Poland as all the reviews were positive and you could tell they were real people. 'The surgery has changed my life and I wouldn't be worried about recommending them.' Chief surgeon Adam Kalecinski said: 'It was the biggest apronectomy I have ever done. 'Because of this I had the help of another surgeon at the clinic to reduce the operation time. 'I am very pleased with the outcome of the operation. 'I believe Michelle intends to carry on losing weight, which is great, but without the apron of skin she will now have a much better quality of life.'","Michelle Lee, 47, lost 11.5 stone after a gastric bypass in 2011 .

"Top-seeded Roger Federer beat big-serving Ivo Karlovic 7-6 (8), 3-6, 6-3 Saturday to reach a ninth consecutive Swiss Indoors final and his 11th overall in his hometown of Basle. Federer, who is looking for his sixth Swiss Indoors title after finishing runner-up in the past two editions, will meet David Goffin after the Belgian kept up his remarkable form by defeating teenage wild card Borna Coric 6-4, 3-6, 6-3. Federer racked up three match points in his final service game but needed just one, winning with a backhand volley at the net to please the partisan crowd. Roger Federer waves to the crowed in Basle after winning through to the Swiss Indoors final . The former world No 1 beat big-hitting Ivo Karlovic 7-6 (8), 3-6, 6-3 on Saturday in his hometown . The home favourite reaches his ninth consecutive Swiss Indoors final and his 11th overall at the Basle event . Karlovic hit 33 aces but it was not enough to secure what would have been just his second victory over Federer in 12 meetings. Karlovic then went close to breaking serve late in the first set but sent a return into the net, and Federer took the lead after a closely-fought tiebreaker which he won with a crosscourt backhand that landed just inside the far corner. The players only lost a combined three points on their serve in the first seven games of the second set before Karlovic earned a break. Federer upped his game in the final set where a run of 12 consecutive points saw the 33-year-old Swiss break at love as well as winning two love service games. Federer, who has lost the last two finals in Basle, plays an overhead shot during his win on Saturday . Federer will chase his sixth Swiss Indoors title when he faces David Goffin in the final . Karlovic smashed 33 aces but it wasn't enough to secure his second win in 12 games against Federer . For Goffin, it was his 43rd victory in 45 matches since his straight-sets loss to Andy Murray at Wimbledon, and it sent the 23-year-old Belgian into his third Tour-level final. ""It means a lot,"" Goffin said. ""It wasn't my best match today, but emotionally it was a tough one. I'm really happy. I have nothing to lose tomorrow."" The seventh-seeded Goffin wasted three match points before converting his fourth attempt when his Croatian opponent returned a smash long. Belgium's David Goffin celebrates after beating Croatian wild card Borna Coric for a finals clash with Federer . Coric had upset Rafael Nadal on Friday to announce himself as one of the rising stars of tennis, and the 17-year-old reaffirmed that early in the match. He raced across from the other side of the court to return a shot which Goffin had seemingly perfectly placed over the net - and which appeared impossible to reach - before landing the ball just inside the baseline to the gasps of the crowd. Goffin made the decisive breakthrough in the fourth game of the final set, sealing the break with a precise backhand down the line. Coric missed the chance to break straight back as Goffin thwarted him with an ace. The Belgian double-faulted twice on match point and sent a backhand volley long before finally grabbing his fourth opportunity.","Roger Federer beat big-serving Ivo Karlovic 7-6 (8), 3-6, 6-3 in Basle .

"It is the question that, among so many in the tumble of . allegation and revelation, just keeps on getting asked. How did she ever get so . close? How did she get close enough to take classified military documents home as she has now admitted to doing? So close that she felt somehow entitled to send harassing emails to Jill Kelley, telling the Florida socialite to 'back off' the man she clearly considered hers. Even before Paula Broadwell's affair with General David . Petraeus emerged it was a point which bothered talk-show hosts, perplexed . interviewers and left onlookers faintly bewildered at the string of appearances which constituted . Broadwell's publicity tour for that book, All In. 'I'm gonna go for it', Paula Broadwell's email to Gen Petraeus led to the biography published in January and described by one critic as 'a Valentine' to the 4 star General . A study in strategy: Broadwell stroked her subject's ego with one hand and shored up her credentials with the other . Her own explanation, such as it was, is glib at best. They . met, she repeatedly trotted out, at a dinner for West Point alumni back in . 2006. After dinner there were drinks and at drinks he gave her his business card and they just kept . in touch. Two years later, in 2008, she was working on a dissertation . on theories of leadership and so, she told Jon Stewart, 'I shot him an email, . and said, ""I'm gonna to go for it.""' Petraeus's reaction was to invite her . well and truly into . his camp - a decision he rues today. He has told his friend Colonel . Peter Mansoor that he considers his actions, 'morally reprehensible', though, interestingly could not resist a flick of self-defence, pointing . out that he had 'violated no laws'. Broadwell promoting her book on the now infamous Jon Stewart interview. 'The real controversy,' he quipped, 'is, is he awesome or incredibly awesome?' He says he is ignoring the media storm and on Friday will testify before a House Committee on the Benghazi consulate attack. He will do so behind closed doors. Still, the inescapable fact remains, that for a man of such experience the extent to which he let his guard . down with Broadwell is breathtaking. But then Broadwell is nothing if not convincing when it . comes to outlining her own credentials and, given the glowing portrait of . 'strategic leadership' she penned as Petraeus's biography, nothing if not flattering. Part Mata-Hari, part Blue-Stocking: Broadwell was, 'an acolyte' never a reporter and an unquestioning devotee of the Gen Petraeus . In one television interview she recalled approaching General . Petraeus and asking him to be a case-study for her dissertation. She wanted to . show, 'What Petraeus's role was in forcing the military to adapt to win the wars we were in'. 'There was no room for a conversation of shortcomings of the . Petraeus theology. She wasn't a reporter. She struck me as an acolyte,' one . advisor to Petraeus is quoted as telling the New York Post. And while Broadwell stroked her subject's ego with one hand . she shored up her own credibility with the other; part Mata Hari, part . blue-stocking. Another in the Petraeus camp noted, on meeting her, 'I was . underwhelmed. It was surprising to me that she was his official biographer.' But, when it came to promoting her book, for Paula . establishing her own academic, military and security credentials came second . only to establishing whether General Petraeus was, as Jon Stewart put it, 'awesome or incredibly awesome'. She dropped academic qualifications and security clearance . the way a socialite might pepper her conversation with boasts of parties . attended and 'BFFs' made. According to Broadwell, being embedded in Afghanistan with Petraeus was . not the huge leap many imagined because, she explained, 'We had previously met . through academia’. She herself was a graduate of West Point and a specialist in counter-terrorism with black ops . experience, high security clearance, 'and then some'. How the suspension of that much vaunted government clearance must smart. Homecoming Queen 1991, pictured here with her King, Mike McCormick, High School Valedictorian, All-State Basketball star...Broadwell never tires of listing her many achievements. She was High School Valedictorian, All State Basketball . player, top of her class at West Point, holder of a masters from Harvard...and . how do we know all of this? Because Broadwell has taken great pains to tell us. We know that her husband Scott Broadwell is not 'just' a . radiologist but an 'interventional radiologist'. Broadwell and her husband, Scott, just days before the scandal broke. He is not, she relentlessly stresses, just a radiologist but an 'interventionalist radiologist' Gen Petraeus and his wife, Holly, at the NFL Super Bowl XLII. She had 'lots of good things to say,' on reading Broadwell's biography of her husband . Writing in The New Republic, . Noam Scheiber states, 'When my friend met her, she was fond of pointing out that her husband was . no mere radiologist but a special breed known as as ""interventional . radiologist."" She would draw out the word ""interventional"" for emphasis.' We know that she can run six-minute miles and do hundreds of . press-ups, that she has 13 per cent body fat and is an ironman triathlete and . marathon runner. We know all this because she has told us. We know that she hosted a charity . BBQ for wounded veterans because she invited Jon Stewart and the assembled . press. Ferocious self-promoter: Broadwell managed to persuade Jon Stewart to attend a fundraising BBQ for wounded veterans in Charlotte, NC . Meanwhile, until she stopped posting, her Twitter feed was a . dizzying mixture of her following both world-causes and the world-famous. According to the Times she recently tweeted,'Heading 2 @AspenInstitue 4 the Security Forum . tomorrow! Panel (media & terrorism) followed by a 1v1 run with Lance . Armstrong'. The political, professional and academic platform on which . she now teeters is one entirely of her own, formidable, construction: itself an . exercise in strategy to rival Petraeus's own. With breathtaking arrogance, Broadwell let it be known that Petraeus referred to her as, 'his Avvatar' She has set out her credentials relentlessly with faux . humility, referring to herself as a mere 'mentee' of Petraeus on one hand then . telling the Charlotte Observer in her hometown in North Carolina, ‘Petraeus . once joked I was his Avatar’ a breathtakingly arrogant aside. Margaret Thatcher once noted that if you had to tell people . you were a lady, you probably weren't. But self-effacement seems the only class . that Paula ever sat out. And the more impressive Broadwell made herself the more . flattering her interest in Petraeus must surely have been. What better way to . appeal to a man in power than to appeal to his vanity? A man of 'overachieving impulses and intellectual pretensions:' the vanities to which Broadwell appealed . Noam Scheiber describes Petraeus as a man of 'overachieving . impulses and intellectual pretensions'. Recognising that, Broadwell seems to have taken those . dubious attributes as her own template for what she described in several . publicity interviews as her 'new path of the soldier-scholar'. As such she has been a keen writer of . opinion pieces and regular poster on the West Point Alumni Notes page. Writing in the Boston Globe in 2009 she tackled the issue of . fraternisation between the sexes on the front line, 'Human sexuality will . always present a challenge to organisational discipline. In isolated outposts [it] could . create a situation where issues of sex impede an organization's survival . skills'. Rather presciently  she concluded, 'Banning sex is . futile and impossible; the best approach is to set rules regarding . fraternization, maintain awareness of relationships within the command, and strictly and fairly discipline transgressors.' On many occasions Broadwell has noted of Petraeus that he, . 'spoke truth to power'. But if the events of the past week have shown anything it is . that the court of the man known as 'King David,' lacked anyone willing or able . to do the same to him. Because where Petraeus 'spoke truth to power' Paula wanted . to dissect that power and to get close to it. Revealingly, in a recent address . to the University of Denver she claimed to have been drawn to the military as an 'instrument of power' and that she wanted to understand how that instrument worked - presumably so . she could play it.","An acolyte never a reporter she appealed to the pretensions of a vain man .

"Paraguay have named Argentine Ramon Diaz, who won the Argentine league title with River Plate this year, as their coach on Thursday. 'Ramon Diaz and the Paraguayan Football Association (APF) have sealed a four-year work accord,' APF president Alejandro Dominguez told a news conference in the capital. 'It's one of the biggest challenges of my career... There's a lot of work to do,' said former River, Inter Milan, Monaco and Argentina striker Diaz. Ramon Diaz has been appointed national coach of Paraguay on a four-year contract . Diaz gives a thumbs up beside Alejandro Dominguez, president of the Paraguayan Football Association . Diaz, River's most successful coach ever with six league titles and the 1996 Libertadores Cup plus a league crown with San Lorenzo, takes over from caretaker Victor Genes. Genes had been in charge since Uruguayan Gerardo Pelusso was sacked in late 2013 after Paraguay failed to qualify for this year's World Cup in Brazil. Paraguay achieved their best World Cup placing in 2010 when they reached the quarter-finals in South Africa under Argentine Gerardo Martino, who is now in charge of his home country. Diaz, with son Emiliano in his backroom staff, faces his first big test at the 2015 Copa America in Chile, which kicks off on June 11 and where they have been drawn in the same group as Argentina, holders Uruguay and Jamaica. Paraguay, who had qualified for four successive World Cup tournaments since 1998, lost their way when Martino quit after steering them to the 2011 Copa America final in Argentina. Handing the task of qualifying for the Brazil finals to the inexperienced Francisco Arce, a fine former international full back, was soon seen as a mistake after a poor start to the qualifying campaign and matters did not improve under Pelusso. Oscar Cardozo (right) scores against Japan en route to the 2010 World Cup quarter-finals . Former Paraguay captain Jose Luis Chilavert does not think Diaz should have been given the job . Charismatic former goalkeeper and captain Jose Luis Chilavert believes grass-roots work is what is needed and does not see Diaz as the right man for the job. 'Ramon Diaz is not the coach Paraguay need, he doesn't develop players and what we need is development,' Chilavert told the Futbol 780 radio programme. 'I don't see a positive outlook for the national team. We must work looking at the long term and the people who handle the team lost a lot of time after Martino's departure.' However, veteran striker Roque Santa Cruz welcomed Diaz's appointment, telling Radio Primero de Marzo: 'We have a renowned coach. This is a positive step, he's a person who can restore a sense of standing to the team.'","Ramon Diaz has signed a four-year deal to become Paraguay manager .

"The world's fattest man, who ballooned to 70 stone, has died at the age of 44. Keith Martin, who died from pneumonia, had been bed-bound, unable to walk and at one point had not left his north London home for a decade. Mr Martin admitted he knew he was killing himself by consuming 20,000 calories a day - almost 10 times the recommended amount for an adult. He had six-egg fry-ups for breakfast then pizzas, kebabs, Chinese takeaways and Big Macs for lunch and dinner, all washed down with six pints of coffee and two litres of fizzy drinks. Last year he had three quarters of his stomach removed and lost half his body weight. But it has now emerged that just eight months later, in March this year, he died from pneumonia. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Keith Martin, pictured in hospital ahead of last year's surgery, whose weight rose to 70 stone and made him the world's fattest man, has died at the age of 44 . Help: Mr Martin, from London, admitted he knew he was killing himself by consuming 20,000 calories a day - almost 10 times the recommended amount for an adult - leaving him unable to walk . Keith left behind his two sisters - Sharon and Tina - who cared for him for many years leading up to his death. Speaking from the home they shared in Harlesden, north  London, Tina said: 'We're still grieving. We miss him very much.' Today the surgeon who removed three quarters of his stomach to help him lose weight has said the Government must bring in a fast-food tax. Unwell: Mr Martin admitted he knew he was killing himself with his eating but had weightloss surgery to try to tackle the problem before he died . Kesava Mannur, who operated on Keith at Homerton Hospital last year, said anyone with a Body Mass Index rate of higher than 30, and type 2 diabetes, should be offered weight-loss surgery. He said: 'The government needs to make unhealthy fast food more expensive - otherwise we'll continue to see more and more people like Keith. 'In his case, it's a shame because he'd had successful surgery despite being high-risk because of his size. It was unlucky he then caught pneumonia' Sadly it was just eight months after Keith - who weighed 70 stone at his heaviest - had undergone a successful gastric sleeve which removed three-quarters of his stomach. If he had lived he would have lost hundreds of pounds and regained his ability to walk and live a normal life, according to Mr Mannur who supports new NHS guidelines which encourage doctors to suggest weight-loss surgery for anyone with a BMI  higher than 30 and type 2 diabetes. That means up to 2 million people could be eligible - and if they all agreed to surgery it would cost the NHS £12billion. In the wake of Chancellor George Osborne's tax reform revelations in this week's autumn statement, Mr Mannur said last night: . Before he died in March, unemployed Keith admitted much of the weight had come from eating huge amounts of super-cheap fast food. Poor diet: Mr Martin feasted on pizzas, kebabs, Chinese takeaways and Big Macs for lunch and dinner . Success: Mr Martin had managed to drop half his weight - from 70 stone to 35 stone -  but died of pneumonia . Keith's surgery was filmed for Channel 5 documentary 70 Stone & Almost Dead. He said before the operation: 'I'd resigned myself that either I was going to die in my bed or I was going to kill myself. But now I think 'you stupid person'. 'I'm a lot more confident than I used to be. I feel a lot happier. 'In a few months' time I want to be up and walking . 'I know the only person to blame is me. All those years wasted. I'm not going to waste anymore of it'. Struggle: Keith, pictured as a teenager in the early nineties, became depressed after the death of his mother and 'ate to ease the pain', he said . Having been stuck in his house for ten years and bedridden for several years due to his size, Keith was able to drop 25 stone in order to qualify for the surgery after switching to a 2,000 calorie a day diet. But just a week after the procedure he discharged himself from the hospital, against doctors' orders, because he was homesick. By October 2013 he was back in hospital with septic shock and dehydration. Two weeks later he contracted pneumonia. Keith spent four months in hospital before he was released in February 2014, having been deemed medically fit. His weight had dropped to 39 stone . After being transported home he said: 'I feel great about surviving the operation. 'It gives me a chance now to go do some of the things I wanted to do - to get myself up and walking, take my dog Benji out for a walk. 'This is the end of one chapter and the beginning of a new chapter. Where it takes me I don't know, but it's going to be fun finding out.' But just a month later he was dead. Prior to the weight-loss surgery, Keith recorded a video message to his family in case he didn't survive. He said: 'Hi guys, I just wanted to let you know that I love you guys and thanks for being there for me. You can tell the rest of the family I love them and thanks for the support. Take care of each other.' Keith's weight ballooned after he became seriously depressed in his twenties. He blamed the bingeing on depression and anxiety which he developed after his mother died - also of pneumonia - when he was 16. Keith, who used to spend his days playing video games and watching TV, explained in 2012: 'I started eating to ease the pain and before I knew it, I was bingeing every time something upset me. 'I've always been depressed. I am an agoraphobic - I'm afraid of public places - but it was never treated. 'I just want to be happy, without needing food to make me happy.'","Keith Martin died from pneumonia following a long battle with his weight .

"Heavy snowfall and chilling temperatures of -30°C do not deter criminals in northern Russia. Now police trying to maintain law in the region are struggling on their snowmobiles and want to use reindeer to combat crime on the bleak tundra. They say that that  mammals are more reliable than their machines and can run fast on deep snow thanks to their adaptable hooves. Crime fighting reindeer? Police trying to maintain law in the region are struggling on their snowmobiles and want to use reindeer (pictured) to combat crime on the bleak tundra . Some areas of the country’s Arctic region are only accessible by reindeer and the Izvestia newspaper has reported that a gang of Siberia’s indigenous people are using reindeer to make a speedy getaway from crime scenes, leaving police on snowmobiles in their wake. Of the 163 crimes reported in the Yamalsky municipality in western Siberia, which were mainly drunken brawls, robberies and ‘acts of hooliganism,’ indigenous minorities committed 127 of them. Russian police chasing the criminals told the newspaper that their snowmobiles can break down and run out of gas – unlike reindeer. Irina Pimkina from the region’s Interior said: ‘Of course we have snowmobiles in service, but one should understand that a machine is a machine.’ The police say that the furry mammals are more reliable than a snowmobile and are faster on deep snow thanks to their adaptable hooves (pictured) which can cut into the ice . Of the 163 crimes reported in the Yamalsky municipality in western Siberia (pictured) which were mainly drunken brawls, robberies and ‘acts of hooliganism,’ indigenous minorities committed 127 of them . Some areas of the country’s Arctic region are only accessible by reindeer it's been reported that a gang of Siberia’s indigenous people are using reindeer to make a speedy getaway from crime scenes, leaving police on snowmobiles in their wake. This stock image shows a man participating in an annual racing competition . The animals are more reliable and do not break down or run out of gas. Creatures can pull a sled which could be used to more easily take criminals back to a poice station. While snowobiles have skis and tracks to grip snow, the animals have hooves that adapt according to the seasons. In the winter, the pads in their hooves expose the rim so the animals can cut into ice and snow to stop them from slipping. Reindeer’s vision may also outperform a snowmobile’s lights, because the animals can see ultraviolet light. ‘A snowmobile can break down or get stuck in the tundra, but the deer will run at all times.’ The force believes that the animals will give them an edge in policing the remote area and they have been asking for reindeer recruits for two years. Reindeer’s hooves are unique because they adapt to seasonal weather conditions, Mother Nature Network reported. When ground is soft in the summer, the bottoms of the animal’s hooves act like sponges to provide traction, while the rim of the hoof becomes exposed in the winter. This means that they can cut into ice and snow to stop them from slipping. They even use them to dig down through hard snow so they can find their favourite food – a lichen known as reindeer moss. Of the 163 crimes reported in the Yamalsky municipality in western Siberia, which were mainly drunken brawls, robberies and ‘acts of hooliganism,’ indigenous minorities committed 127 of them. A stock image of reindeer herders sitting outside a traditional hide tent is shown . The vision of reindeer  may also outperform a snowmobile’s lights, because the animals can see ultraviolet light. Snow reflects up to 90 per cent of UV light and  this ability helps the animals to see clearly in dim lighting and landscapes that are largely white, where may objects blend unto the landscape. Things like fur and urine, for example, show up clearly in ultraviolet light, compared to what humans see. A study by University College London (UCL) revealed in 2011 that reindeer can see light with wavelengths as short as 320 nanometres (nm), considerably below the human threshold of 400 nm. Researchers from the University of Tromsø discovered that the eyes of reindeer change colour according to the seasons too. They wrote: ‘Arctic reindeer eyes change in colour through the seasons from gold through to blue to help them better detect predators.’ While it may seem funny that policemen could use reindeer like a police car, the country’s navy already uses animals to enforce rules. The Russian Defence Ministry uses donkeys patrol the country’s mountain ranges, while the Navy employed the help of dolphins to enable them to detect underwater mines. The ability to see the sun's UV rays reflecting off the snow helps reindeer (pictured) survive in a winter wonderland invisible to other animals . Scientists have found that it's the light of their surroundings, and not Rudoph's nose, which helps guide reindeer in the Arctic. The ability to see the sun's UV rays reflecting off the snow helps reindeer survive in a winter wonderland invisible to other animals, according to research. Scientists have learned that the animals' special eyesight allows them to spot hidden predators, such as wolves, and find vital winter food sources. Human eyes block off ultraviolet light and can be damaged by the penetrating rays, resulting in snow blindness. Professor Glen Jeffery, from University College London (UCL), said: 'We discovered that reindeer can not only see ultraviolet light but they can also make sense of the image to find food and stay safe. 'Humans and almost all other mammals could never do this as our lenses just don't let UV through the eye.' Humans are able to see a rainbow of light wavelengths ranging from around 700 nanometres (nm) - corresponding to the colour red - to 400nm (violet). Professor Jeffery's team carried out tests, which showed that reindeer can see wavelengths down to between around 350 and 320nm, taking them to the ultraviolet end of the spectrum. During the arctic winter, when the sun barely rises in the middle of the day, sunlight reaching the ground is scattered so that most of it is blue or in the form of UV rays. In addition, snow reflects up to 90 per cent of the UV light that falls on it. The 'supersight' of reindeer enables the creatures to exploit these conditions to their advantage. 'When we used cameras that could pick up UV, we noticed that there are some very important things that absorb UV light and therefore appear black, contrasting strongly with the snow,' Professor Jeffery said. 'This includes urine - a sign of predators or competitors, lichens - a major food source in winter, and fur, making predators such as wolves very easy to see despite being camouflaged to other animals that can't see UV.'","Siberia’s indigenous people are using reindeer to make a speedy getaway from crime scenes, a Russian newspaper has reported .

"Mesut Ozil was beamed across the giant screens inside Dortmund’s big yellow box of noise before the game. He had been given an electronic makeover, tendons lit up in green to give him a robotic, other-worldly feel. It was part of an advert for a new adidas 'Predator' boot. A predator? Not really. It will take more than a few fancy sci-fi graphics to turn Ozil into a predator. It is not his style. He has not scored a goal for Arsenal since April. He has never scored away from home for the club. Out of this world? Not really. Robotic? Not in a good way. Mesut Ozil was substituted in the 62nd minute after another disappointing performance for the Gunners . The German international looks dejected after Ciro Immobile scores for Borussia Dortmund . The £42.5million signing from Real Madrid failed to live up to his price-tag at the Westfalenstadion . Mesut Ozil's lack of influence is perfectly demonstrated by his sparse heat map . Former Manchester United ace Juan Sebastian Veron struggled to get to grips with playing in England . Former United boss Sir Alex Ferguson forked out £28.1million to bring Veron to the Premier League in 2001 . However Veron's stay at Old Trafford lasted just two years as he was sold to Chelsea for £15m . Veron (Manchester United) - 11 goals in 82 games . Ozil (Arsenal) - 7 goals in 45 games . 'Instinct Takes Over' promised adidas. But inertia took hold. The game kicked off and Arsenal froze. Little more than an hour later, Ozil was replaced by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain with the Londoners already two down. During that time he had never quite got to the pace of the game. It was not only Ozil. In fairness, other high-profile team-mates were struggling to cope; overwhelmed by the frenetic tempo and intensity of Dortmund. Arsenal could not get the controlled possession in midfield which might allow Ozil or Alexis Sanchez to sparkle. But there are times when you look to the big players to produce something special to change the rhythm of the game. Sanchez has done it at times this season. Ozil has not. Arsene Wenger must have hoped this would be the occasion when his £42.5million record produced him a flash of magic to give his team a grip on a difficult game. Last season, when Ozil was faltering after a promising start in north London, Wenger claimed this would be the season when he came into his own. He would, the manager claimed, be the Player of the Year. However, there are no signs his Arsenal career is about to transform. He is drifting down the path of Juan Sebastian Veron, unquestionably gifted but perhaps not cut out for the way an English team want to play. Arsene Wenger must choose between Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (left) or Santi Cazorla (right) Hector Bellerin made his Arsenal debut in the Champions League against Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday . Danny Welbeck failed to hit the back of the net despite having chances to score his first Arsenal goal . Who wants a play-maker who cannot influence the game? At some point soon, the Arsenal boss must consider whether to cut his losses. Does he reshape his team to play him in a more central position? Or drop him. Is he better off with Oxlade-Chamberlain or Santi Cazorla? He is certainly not short of options in this position. Such a move may damage Ozil’s confidence. Or it may jolt him into life. It must be worth a try. He was not inspired by his return to his native Ruhr Valley, down the road from Gelsenkirchen where he was born and bred. Instead, he suffered another night of anonymity. For most of the first-half, he could be found on the right wing, with teenager Hector Bellerin making his first start for the club behind him at right-back. Bellerin’s accelerated promotion was the result of a sequence of minor mishaps which regularly seem to befall Wenger’s squad and he could probably done with someone slightly more industrious and protective ahead of him. That was Wenger’s choice. Arsenal boss Wenger was left disappointed by his side's poor performance in Germany . VIDEO Disappointed Wenger bemoans counter-attacks . Germany seem to get by with Ozil on the wing. They won the World Cup with him there. Perhaps they have more defensive solidity elsewhere to compensate. Arsenal are fragile and, in Dortmund, many of the early problems from the areas occupied (or not) by Ozil and Bellerin. The defensive shift is not his strength. So, perhaps, he could turn the game with a waft of his left boot. There were neat touches, as ever. When Wenger claimed at the weekend, after a draw against Manchester City, that Ozil’s class shines through when he studies a replay of the game. He alluded to the weight of his pass and his decision making. There was one moment in the 18th minute, when he slid a low cross unerringly to Danny Welbeck in the penalty box, but it came to nothing. There was a delicious long-range pass to Sanchez, who had drifted offside. At times, he made the difficult things look easy. At other times, he made the easy things look difficult. Ozil was not the reason Arsenal lost in Dortmund but his inability to influence the game is becoming a problem Wenger has to address.","Arsenal star Mesut Ozil again failed to live up to expectations .

"He has a number of alter egos - Mr Ryder Cup, The Postman (because he always delivers) - but there is no mistaking Ian Poulter when the biennial contest against the United States rolls into town. The 38-year-old seems to grow in stature in the trans-Atlantic battles, and no wonder as he has been Europe's leading points scorer in the last three meetings and was the team's inspirational talisman who sparked the 'Miracle at Medinah' two years ago. He has been identified by US captain Tom Watson as the man they want to take down as a statement of intent and while Poulter's form was not good enough to earn him a place outright, his selection as a wildcard was never really in doubt because he has a history of raising his game to a level rarely, if at all, seen in his individual performances.

'I'm passionate as a team player to be mentioned with the likes of Seve (Ballesteos) and Monty (Colin Montgomerie) and those players is an absolute honour. 'I'm not sure whether I transform (in a Ryder Cup) but I love it and I enjoy what it stands for and I embrace that. 'My record in the Ryder Cup is exceptional and my stroke play record isn't, so quite clearly I've struggled to take what I have in the Ryder Cup and put that out for 103 other weeks in between them. 'It's hard but (you have) to realise that what every putt means in the Ryder Cup is the equivalent of winning a tournament and the emotion that goes through your body is the same as the putt that you experience on a Sunday in a big tournament. Poulter wears his heart on his sleeve and couldn't contain his excitement during 2012's 'Miracle at Medinah' The 38-year-old comes into his own at the Ryder Cup, and roars with the delight at Europe's victory in 2012 . 'Potentially, you're holing lots of winning tournament putts throughout a three-day spell and sometimes that all adds up to more wins than you would ever have in your professional lifetime.' Poulter enters this Ryder Cup, his fifth, with expectation weighing heavier than ever before on his shoulders, purely on the basis of the role he played in 2012. It cannot be underestimated how significant his run of five birdies in the last five holes to win the Saturday afternoon fourballs with Rory McIlroy was with the United States leading 10-4 at that point. That was both the beginning of the most remarkable comeback in the history of the event and the start of Poulter's step towards Ryder Cup greatness. The wildcard admitted that he struggles to recapture his Ryder Cup form in other tournaments . As a man not short of self-confidence the Englishman is happy to carry the burden which will undoubtedly be on him this weekend. 'I put enough pressure on myself leading in and I work hard to be able to deliver in Ryder Cups,' he added. 'I put more pressure on myself than the millions or billions of people who are out there wanting me to hole putts. 'I'm very demanding of what it is I have to do out there and deliver upon and I feel that I can manage that level within myself, because that's what I expect to do. Poulter says he is thrilled to be put in the same Ryder Cup bracket as  the late, great Seve Ballesteros . 'From all the previous Ryder Cups that I've witnessed, being there from 1993, I don't think negatively. 'I think positively that we are going to go out there and deliver. I never feel that I'm going to go out there and think 'What if something doesn't happen?' It's more to the point of 'Let's go out there and do the job'. 'You don't need to control it. You've been waiting for it for a long time so you just need to grab hold of it and let it go.'","Ian Poulter is known for coming into his own at the Ryder Cup .

Liverpool icon and keen golfer Dalglish may have divided loyalties this weekend, though, as the 22nd Merseyside derby clashes with the Ryder Cup in his native Scotland. The Scot, who got closer than most to the action at Gleneagles after being invited to play in Thursday's challenge on the PGA Centenary course on the eve of the event, will only get to see two of the three days' play live. Dalglish will miss Saturday, though, as he will be at Anfield for Liverpool's early kick-off against Everton. He said: 'I didn't get a captain's pick so I'll be going home for the game but I'll be here Friday and Sunday.'

When asked what it was like to sign for Liverpool from Bournemouth in 1991 while Dalglish was manager at Anfield, Redknapp said: 'It was an amazing feeling. He was me hero, and then I signed for Liverpool, the best club in the world. I loved every second of it.' And Redknapp joked: 'He (Dalglish) left about a month later, probably after watching me play!'

"Former England captain David Beckham is backing Wayne Rooney to have a great World Cup despite Paul Scholes’ criticism of the England and Manchester United striker. Scholes claimed Rooney is past his best and questioned if manager Roy Hodgson has the guts to drop him. But Beckham, who saw England draw with Honduras here, said: ‘I’d always back “Wazza” because he’s a great talent and he’s a great player for England. Every time he’s stepped out in an England shirt, he always gives 110 per cent. Scholesy is a person that knows Wayne as well and has been around him for quite a few years and everyone is entitled to their opinion but not everyone is going to agree with it. Thumbs up: David Beckham has backed Wayne Rooney to have a good World Cup . ‘In the games I’ve seen him play for United, he’s been the shining light. But Scholesy’s been around him more than I have.’ Beckham agrees that Rooney will be frustrated at not having scored in eight World Cup finals games in 2006 and 2010 but he added: ‘He has always been about more than just scoring goals, he’s a goalscorer but he works hard for the team and that is what Wayne’s game has always been about. ‘If he doesn’t score goals he’s either assisting or creating something for the team and working hard for the team. I think for the opposition to see Wayne Rooney on a team sheet, that scares them.’ Pressure: Rooney has come under fire from former team-mate Paul Scholes . Big tournament: Rooney says he is fit going into this World Cup . Beckham doesn’t know why Scholes, his previously low-profile friend from the Class of 92 at United has suddenly become so vocal, especially in the spat with Rooney. Beckham said: ‘Scholesy doesn’t say much, but when he says it, it’s always cutting, he’s got a sharp tongue.’ As well as backing Rooney, Beckham is enthused by the youngsters that manager Roy Hodgson has selected. ‘I’m really excited about England. They’ve got some really good young players in there. Roy has gone for that group, it makes it promising with the experienced players in there as well. ‘Will the young players be ready for a stage like this? Yes because they’re playing in the biggest league in the world, week in week out and so I don’t see why they will go over there and be afraid to play. They are confident performers who will not be scared.’ Critical: Paul Scholes said Rooney was past his best . Liverpool’s Raheem Sterling is the one out of the Hodgson youth pack to have caught Beckham’s eye, with England’s most capped outfield player saying: ‘I think he’s a great talent, he plays with the flair of a kid who goes out and just plays. The games I’ve seen him play for Liverpool and England, he’s just stepped into a role and deserves to be here. ‘(Daniel) Sturridge has had a great season. He’s a talent that can hurt people. Oxlade-Chamberlain will hopefully recover from his injury, which is looking not as bad as everyone thought at the time, because he was exceptional the other night.’ Asked about another young talent, Jack Wilshere, wearing his No 7 shirt, he joked: ‘I’d rather I had it, but to be fair I had it for a few years and Jack has done well.’ Pressing for a start: Ross Barkley is pushing for a place in England's starting line up . In contention: As is Raheem Sterling, despite his suspension on Saturday . Beckham also praised captain Steven Gerrard, saying: ‘People talk about players from the Premier League being tired going into the World Cup. But Stevie’s looking as fresh as anything and he’s one of the older players. ‘He’s an exceptional player and Stevie will have the team ready for Brazil.’ Beckham, who is taking his sons to Brazil for the semi-finals and final, added. ‘Hopefully, England will still be in it.’","Former England skipper backs Rooney to have a good tournament in Brazil .

"A new exhibition has opened in New York City which showcases the art of fake high fashion items and counterfeit designer products. Faking It: Originals, Copies, and Counterfeits, which is on view at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology until April 25, 2015, also highlights the incredible popularity of certain counterfeit items, such as the much sought-after 'Homiés' designs, which were inspired by high-end brand Hermès. And it's not just modern-day trends that are featured in the exhibit. According to the show's curator, Ariele Elia, the trend for producing fake fashion spans many a decade - dating back to the early and mid 20th century. From high-end to Homiés: The exhibition showcases some counterfeit labels that have proved to be almost as popular as the original brands they were inspired by . Seeing double: It's hard to tell which is the authentic design and which is the fake. In this case, the suit on the left was a licensed copy of the Chanel original on the right . It's all about the label: The easiest way to tell these two designs apart is by spotting which one has a label, and which one doesn't . 'The oldest piece we have in our show is a pair of shoes from the 18th century with paste stone buckles that imitate diamonds,' she told i-D Magazine. 'But, copying mostly started with the advent of the couture system and designer labels. [Early and mid 20th century] couturiers created ""licensed copies"", which were line-for-line copies with the same materials and technique, except without labels.' Ms Elia also explained that brands have been trying to eliminate copies of their products for decades and added that both Balenciaga and Givenchy banned all press from their 1956 collections because they thought it would help to cut down on the number of knock-off fakes being created. 'It didn't completely work,' she said. 'Buyers might buy one garment, but they'd see the whole collection. Photography and sketches weren't allowed in shows, so they had special copyists and sketchers who would remember.' But while some people might view fake fashion items as being obviously cheap reproductions, when it came to differentiating between what exhibition pieces were real and which were fake, Ms Elia admitted it wasn't always that easy. 'With some of the accessories it's very difficult to tell whether they're authentic,' she explained. A red sole is a red sole: Often, customers don't mind whether the product is real or fake, provided it has the same look and feel to it, such as these knock-off Christian Louboutin . All the trimmings: The distinctively red-soled shoes even came with their own fake card of authenticity . The origins of fashion: Some of the pieces included in the collection, such as these vintage dresses, help visitors to understand more about the history of clothing design . 'Often, it's only on the inside where it shows. There will be shoddy construction or the leather will be buckling, even if the outside is perfect.' The exhibition doesn't just include exact copies of high-end designs; there are a number of pieces on display which use particularly distinctive brand logos, such as those used by Louis Vuitton and Gucci, in completely unique designs, for example an original dress created by an independent designer which is then emblazoned with the iconic LV pattern. Interestingly, quite a few of the designers whose fake fashions are on display faced no legal action from the brands that they copied, despite their similarities being so blatant - and some designers went as far as to see the counterfeits as something of a compliment. 'Chanel, for one, was into people knocking off her things,' Ms Elia added. 'I think she understood the fashion system and that there isn't any bad press.'","The show at the New York's Fashion Institute of Technology's Museum examines the history of popular knock-offs .

"Tucked away in the south of Guangzhou city in China lives the largest group of Koalas found outside Australia, a 50-strong community spanning five generations. Chimelong Wildlife Park has been breeding koalas in a programme that has been bolstered by 13 animals imported from Australia in 2006. There have been some startling successes, including the birth of a pair of rare koala twins in 2007. But while the cuddly koalas draw in tourists from all over mainland China and the world, animal rights groups have repeatedly condemned the treatment and living conditions of animals inside the facility. Staff at the Chimelong Wildlife Park in the south of Guangzhou city in China pose with koalas for a group photo . Among the 50-strong community is a pair of 'koala twins', only the second pair to have ever been born in captivity . Chimelong is the only zoo in China to house koalas. The twin koalas they bred are only the second set of twins ever to be born in captivity, with the last set being born more than 50 years ago. Despite these impressive feats, animal rights groups have condemned the park for operating animal performance circuses. One online petition against Chimelong includes 'Ban Animals in Chime-Long International Circus', which endeavours to 'save 400 animals from the largest circus in the world.' Circuses that feature animal stunts are popular across China, with activists warning thousands of animals are routinely beaten and abused to make the shows happen. Members of the animal conservation group Animals Asia have visited the park on numerous occasions to audit their treatment of animals, and have actively condemned their treatment of numerous animals. According to a report from 2009, ‘The koalas are kept in small concrete enclosures containing a number of small trees. Some enclosures contain just one tree.’ Despite these impressive feats, animal rights groups have condemned the park, which also operates animal performance circuses . According to an Animals Asia report from 2009, 'the koalas are kept in small concrete enclosures containing a number of small trees. Some enclosures contain just one tree’ David Neal, the director of Animals Asia, told Daily Mail Australia he has tried to speak with the park for a number of years, but has never received a response. ‘We condemn the use of animals in circus performances and the use of animals as photo props throughout China,' he said. Mr Neil said the parks have been directed to cancel their animal performances. ‘Chimelong safari park is under the administration of the local forestry bureau, which released a notice to end performances and the associated animal cruelty in 2010. ‘We doubt however the forestry authorities were directed to take action, as we have seen little to on changes in the conditions of the park since 2010.' 'Change will only happen when the public demand it. At the moment the public are largely unaware of the welfare implications associated with the use of animals performances and the keeping  animals in substandard captive conditions,' he said. 'As awareness grows, the parks will improve to meet public expectations.' David Neal, the director of Animals Asia, told Daily Mail Australia he has tried to speak with the park for a number of years, but has never received a response .","Chimelong Wildlife Park has the largest group of koalas outside Australia, with a 50-strong community .

"As a younger dog, Bennie once saved his family from a house fire, but once he got older his family couldn't keep him. The graying 10-year-old chocolate lab was given up by his owners because they had a child who Bennie was not getting along with. Tarah Motuzas, who runs Toronto-based animal rescue Canine Haven, said on Wednesday that Bennie was currently in the process of an adoption. Surrendered: The graying 10-year-old chocolate lab was given up by his owners because they had a child who Bennie was not getting along with . 'He was surrendered to a boarding facility in Toronto,' said Motuzas. 'Luckily my sister works there and she reached out to me since I run Canine Haven.' She posted Bennie's story to Facebook and received a strong response from people eager to adopt him, with one dog lover asking if it was possible to arrange an adoption to Sweden. Motuzas said that Bennie was a regular at the facility where he was surrendered. Hero: Motuzas says that as a younger dog, Bennie once saved his family from a house fire, but once he got older his family couldn't keep him . Playful: A Facebook post for Bennie says he is best with older, quieter dogs and does not like children or cats, and he's already attracted some interest in adopting him . 'I think surrendering him to a place where he knows people and is comfortable was the best they could've done for him,' said Motuzas. 'Its better than a shelter.' 'These are our companions, we are suppose to look after them, care for them and keep them out of harms way,' she added. 'If you're not willing to do that, get a fish.'","10-year-old Bennie was surrendered by his owners because he was not getting along with their child .

"Rory McIlroy and Phil Mickelson will go head-to-head as the 40th Ryder Cup gets under way on Friday morning with the match-up everyone wanted to see. American captain Tom Watson sounded like a man who had got what he wanted when he hailed the final fourballs match as the ‘main event’. ‘We’ve certainly got a match in that one, haven’t we?’ enthused the 65-year-old. ‘I will be on the first tee watching the other three matches tee off and then that’s the one I will be watching.’ Team Europe applaud Amc Macdonald as she comes on to sing in the opening ceremony .

The Americans are desperate to knock world No 1 McIlroy off his perch and are clearly buoyant that their star pairing will have the chance in the anchor match, which will also feature Sergio Garcia and Keegan Bradley. On Wednesday, Mickelson tried to needle the Northern Irishman with a pointed comment about the legal action he is taking against his old management company, where Graeme McDowell is a shareholder. ‘At least we don’t litigate against one another,’ he said. Perhaps the only man who looked less than delighted was Europe captain Paul McGinley. ‘I don’t see that match-up as a big deal, to be honest,’ he commented. America will start and finish the fourballs with established pairings — Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson will play the opening match for the visitors against Henrik Stenson and Justin Rose — while Europe will field four new ones. McGinley admitted he hadn’t seen the pairing of McIlroy and Garcia coming but had been persuaded by the players themselves. ‘We started a dialogue back at Wentworth in May and it was clear they formed a bond and friendship during their battles over the summer,’ he said. ‘A big reason why I have put them together is their communication with me.’ Martin Kaymer poses for a selfie with a Team Europe supporter during Thursday's practice session .

Explaining his overall strategy, McGinley said he wanted players in the first and last matches who were at or near the top of the world rankings. It might be the third match before the home crowd really finds its voice as local hero Stephen Gallacher gets a dream Ryder Cup debut alongside Ian Poulter. ‘Stevie’s got a great record at Gleneagles and it’s supposed to be windy in the morning, which will be right up his street,’ reasoned McGinley. ‘He’s got the perfect big-match player alongside him as well. What I will be telling Stevie is that he has nothing to prove. ‘He just needs to be himself and relish it.’ Their opponents are two rookies in Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed and Watson admitted: ‘I’ve said to them I’m throwing you into the ocean without a life preserver.’ But he added: ‘I’m just so impressed with their attitude. Jordan is so strong-willed, while if Patrick gets it going he thinks he can beat the world. I like that in a player.’ Watson caused some raised eyebrows by leaving out Matt Kuchar and Jim Furyk, who are two of the three highest-ranked Americans in the world ratings. ‘You can bet they will both be playing in the afternoon, as will the other two players who are not playing in the morning,’ he said. Similarly, McGinley all but promised that the partnerships of McDowell and Victor Dubuisson and Lee Westwood and Jamie Donaldson will be utilised in the afternoon foursomes.

"Bad designs and unchecked contractors contributed to failing batteries in Boeing's 787 Dreamliners that led to one catching on fire at Boston's Logan Airport in 2013, safety officials determined. The National Transportation Safety Board released a report Monday that found the plane's battery had a faulty design that neither Boeing nor the Federal Aviation Authority stepped in to fix. 'The investigation identified deficiencies in the design and certification processes that should have prevented an outcome like this,' said acting NTSB chairperson Christopher Hart in a statement. Scroll down for video . Catastrophe: Bad designs and unchecked contractors contributed to failing batteries in Boeing's 787 Dreamliners that led to one catching on fire at Boston's Logan Airport in 2013, safety officials determined . 'Fortunately, this incident occurred while the airplane was on the ground and with firefighters immediately available.' Ars Technica breaks down the two batteries aboard the 787, a main battery that powers maintenance systems and provides backup power to control systems, and a rear battery that can start an auxiliary engine used for ground power and backup power in flight. According to the NTSB investigation, the rear batteries became overheated shortly before the Boston fire, leading to a 'thermal runaway,' in which a chemical reaction was triggered that released heat and caused the batteries to catch fire. The fire, which happened back in January 2013, happened aboard a 787 that had just arrived from Tokyo to Boston's Logan International Airport. The plane was empty at the time. After the fire, the FAA grounded the entire fleet of 787 Dreamliners  while the incident was investigated. The NTSB study cited internal short circuiting and poor 'thermal management' in the large lithium-ion batteries as leading to the runaway. Inspection: NTSB materials engineer Matt Fox looks over the battery that was on board the plane that caught fire in Boston in 2013 . Another issue was one of accountability during the design process, exacerbated by the complex chain between manufacturer, contractor and subcontractor working on the battery. The batteries themselves were manufactured by GS Yuasa. The Japanese corporation had been contracted by French aerospace technology firm Thales, which was working for Boeing. According to the report, Thales changed certain plans without consulting Boeing, plans which GS Yuasa then deviated from. According to the NTSB probe, neither the FAA or Boeing audited the battery maker, allowing Thales to perform its own investigations, which found no problems related to battery or cell manufacturing. After the fire, the FAA and Boeing did audit GS Yuasa's work, and what they found did not inspire confidence. Their technicians weren't following instructions for building or installing battery components and there was 'no traceability [of components] to assembly drawing and instructions,' the report read. The 'non-compliance items at Thales involved adherence to contractual requirements for Boeing's approval on drawing or procedural changes,' the NTSB investigation found. Battery problems only compound issues with the 787, with cracks in wings of aircraft still being manufactured discovered more recently. In a statement to MailOnline Boeing said: 'We have reviewed the NTSB's report and appreciate the hard work of the NTSB and all other investigation parties, which has advanced the understanding of this incident. We concur with the report's probable cause finding – a short circuit within one battery cell led to venting and cell-to-cell propagation that caused the battery failure. 'We remain confident in the comprehensive improvements made to the 787 battery system following this event, and in the overall performance of the battery system and the safety of the airplane. We continue to work reliability improvements on the 787 and will do so throughout the span of the program.'","An investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board found batteries aboard the planes were poorly designed .

"A four-floor sprawling apartment situated in one of the country's largest Grade-I listed Georgian mansions has been put on the market for just £75,000. The apartment, which has four rooms, is part of the exclusive Patshull Hall, in Staffordshire, and is significantly cheaper than the current average price tag for a home in Britain. However, despite its stunning location, the property has gone on the market with an affordable guide price because it is only half finished. The apartment, situated in the Grade-I listed Georgian mansion Patshull Hall, in Staffordshire (pictured), has gone on the market for £75,000 . The low starting price of £75,000 for the four-floor, four-room apartment is because it is half finished and requires additional renovation works . The apartment has four rooms, most of which are interconnecting, but these could be transformed into separate en suite bedrooms . With a long driveway through the manicured grounds of the estate to reach the apartment, the property is surrounded by beautiful parkland and appears stunning from the outside. However, the inside is work in progress, with painting, decorating and basic refurbishing required before it is the finished article for its next owner. The apartment spans over four floors and has four interconnecting rooms, which could be transformed into en suite bedrooms.

The estate was acquired in 1765 by Sir George Pigot upon his retirement as Governor of Madras. Pigot then had England's finest landscape architect, Lancelot 'Capability' Brown, to landscape a grand 340 acre park including a lake in the grounds. The mansion has been used for various different purposes over the years, including a rehabilitation centre in the 1940s and an orthopaedic hospital. The sprawling estate was broken up in 1990 and many of the acres were sold off to create Patshull Park hotel and golf course. It has been used as a wedding venue until the company collapsed and now the property is being sold off for accommodation.

"All the elements required for a proper party were present and correct at Celtic Park. Amid the tickertape and the fireworks, and in front of heroes old and new, Neil Lennon’s side signed off their season with little touches of class. Parkhead resounded to the celebration of three-in-a-row long before Scott Brown hoisted the Premiership trophy high above his head. With 102 goals scored and 99 points amassed – 20 more than last season – this has been about as convincing a title defence as it is possible to stage. Many of the reasons why were on display as Dundee United were vanquished to ensure the optimum atmosphere in which to toast another triumph. Party Bhoys: Scott Brown (centre) lifts the Scottish Premiership trophy, Celtic's 45th league triumph . Legend: Stiliyan Petrov, a former Celtic captain, addresses the crowd after the match .

Party time: Celtic players celebrate in the home dressing room after receiving the trophy . Splash: The champagne is opened in the Celtic dressing room as the players celebrate their title win . The resistance of the Tannadice side . was broken by a 21st goal of the season for Anthony Stokes, who has been . a key element of the Celtic attack. Even more prolific has been double . Player of the Year award winner Kris Commons, so it was fitting he . should net the final goal of their campaign to hoist his personal tally . to a remarkable 32. In . between, there was time for the distribution of a leaving gift. Having . emerged from the bench to win a penalty, Georgios Samaras was handed the . honour by regular taker Commons. He made no mistake to draw an . individual ovation from the crowd that appeared to leave him with tears . in his eyes. The Greek international is out of contract and claims he is . departing after six-and-a-half years because of the lack of a formal . offer from the Celtic hierarchy. An . unfortunate own goal from Filip Twardzik was the only small negative . during the match, but it was rendered irrelevant by the time John . Hartson and Stilian Petrov emerged to lead the presentation party after . full-time. Both men, . who have fought serious health issues, are former team-mates of Lennon . from the days when Martin O’Neill and Gordon Strachan filled the . manager’ s role. The current incumbent has now joined Strachan, Jock . Stein and Willie Maley in an elite band of Celtic bosses to have won . three successive championships. With a sea of green flags swaying in the . stands, Lennon was given a cheer as loud as any. United, . of course, hope to have a party of their own back here on Saturday. And . their team selection was hugely influenced by that impending date with . destiny in the Scottish Cup final against St Johnstone.

The only real surprise was a first start since September 2012 . for Czech youngster Twardzik, who was asked to slot in at left-back. All . in the Parkhead side wore black armbands in memory of little Oscar . Knox, the five-year-old Celtic fan who passed away earlier this week . after a two-and-a-half year battle against an aggressive form of cancer. A . tribute to his all-too-short life formed a profoundly poignant prelude . to the celebrations which followed. Oscar’s image was displayed on the . giant screens inside Parkhead before kick-off as the ground reverberated . to a heartfelt rendition of ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’. On . the field, the game developed at a decidedly end-of-season pace. Celtic . carried the greater threat and their first real opportunity arrived . when Leigh Griffiths escaped down the left flank and tried to catch out . Radoslaw Cierzniak at a tight angle. The Polish goalkeeper was, however, . wise to his intentions and turned the ball behind for a corner. United . sought to maximise their counter-attacks and might well have snatched . the lead after 20 minutes. Ryan Gauld advanced into central space in . front of the home penalty area, all the time glancing to his right to . see Ryan Dow charge forward in support. Gauld’s pass was perfectly . weighted but, rather than strike first-time, Dow took a touch that . enabled Efe Ambrose to block out any real danger.

Griffiths . and Stokes continue to lurk with menace for the remainder of the . opening period but couldn’t produce anything that caused Cierzniak . excessive concern. Shots from awkward positions and distance were often . the end product. Things . were even quieter for Fraser Forster, but United finally drew him into . action five minutes after the restart. Mark Wilson, back on his old . stomping ground, worked a short corner routine with Dow before sending . Stefan Johansen the wrong way with a nimble dummy. That opened the way . for a low shot that Forster pushed out, with the goalkeeper then . relieved to see Farid El Alagui spoon the rebound too high. Griffiths . had the ball in the other net seconds later, only for an offside flag . to truncate his celebrations. It was his final act before being replaced . by Samaras with 30 minutes remaining. All . of a sudden, Celtic seemed to find greater potency. Charlie Mulgrew . burst clear of a trio of Tannadice players nipping at his ankles before . picking out Commons. He surged forward to angle in a drive that . Cierzniak denied at his near post. Then, . on 64 minutes, the breakthrough arrived as Celtic made it into treble . figures for Premiership goals. Commons whipped in a deep delivery from . the right that found the United centre-backs wanting. It was too high . for Samaras but Stokes was right behind him to head into the far corner . of the net.

McNamara’s men found themselves two down with 14 minutes to go as . Samaras offered up a little souvenir of his Celtic career. A poor touch . from Armstong allowed Stokes to gather and thread a pass in the . direction of the Greek. He did superbly to win a sliding challenge with . Gavin Gunning before being toppled as he tried to round Cierzniak. Samaras took the penalty himself – amid chanting of his name - and calmly planted it in the net. United briefly threatened a comeback when a cutback from Mackay-Steven was deflected past Forster by the unfortunate Twardzik. Celtic, . though, restored their two-goal advantage with nine minutes remaining. A . slip by Keith Watson left Commons clean through and his casual dink . beyond Cierzniak was confirmation of a player at the peak of his powers.","Celtic beat Dundee United 3-1 on final day of season .

"Gunfire rang out and buildings were set ablaze in Grozny this morning as the Chechen capital witnessed a battle that left at least 10 policemen and nine militants dead. More than six hours after fighting broke out, Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov said a multi-story building the militants had occupied in central Grozny had been destroyed by fire and six gunmen killed. He later raised the total number of dead gunmen to nine after several more were found in a city school and an operation launched to 'liquidate' them. Several buildings in the city were left devastated by fire. Scroll down for video . Blaze: A publishing house building is seen in flames in the centre of Grozny early this morning after gunmen launched an attack in the capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya . Inferno: Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov said the building in central Grozny had been occupied by the militants before it was destroyed by fire and six gunmen killed . Crackdown: In this photo released by the Anti-Terrorist Committee, armoured personnel carriers are parked in downtown Grozny as security forces respond to the attack on the city by militants . Military zone: Heavily armed personnel mill around their APCs as they battle to end the attack . Operation: Security personnel can be seen in cover as the multi-storey building burns with the gunmen inside . Security: A Chechen Interior Ministry servicemen stands guard at the site of the counter-terrorism operation . Unrest is common across the North Caucasus, which has been gripped by an Islamist insurgency going back to the collapse of the Soviet Union. But forceful measures have spared Grozny significant violence for several years. Security officials and Mr Kadyrov said militants travelling in several cars killed three traffic police at a checkpoint in Grozny. This was disputed by Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti, which cited an unidentified law enforcement source as saying five police officers were killed. An Associated Press reporter saw the building - a publishing house - in flames and heard the sound of heavy-calibre gunfire before dawn, several hours after the unrest erupted. The AP reporter also saw the body of someone in civilian clothing in the street near the publishing house as fighting continued. It was not clear how and when the person had been killed. The Moscow-based National Anti-Terrorist Committee, a federal agency, announced it had imposed a counter-terrorism regime on the centre of Grozny. This officially allows heightened security measures to be enforced, and typically indicates the imminent use of heavy force to quash unrest. Life News, a news outlet believed to have links to Russian security services, cited police as saying about 15 people had seized three cars late last night in the village of Shalazhi and drove to Grozny, some 30 miles away. Aftermath: Smoke rises from the publishing house as the sun rises on a bleak morning in Grozny . Ongoing: Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov said several other gunmen had been found in a city school and an operation was underway to 'liquidate' them, according to Russian news agency Interfax . Daily life: Local women look at smoke rising from the publishing house . Mr Kadyrov said on his Instagram account, which he uses to issue public statements, that the traffic police officers were shot dead as they attempted to stop the cars carrying the gunmen. In a message posted several hours later, Mr Kadyrov said that six militants were killed in the standoff at the publishing house. 'Not one bandit managed to get out. I directly ran the operation myself,' he wrote. Mr Kadyrov posted a picture showing the lower half of an apparently dead gunman lying beside a rifle. It was not immediately clear if it showed one of the attackers. Dmitry Trenin, chief of the Carnegie Moscow Center, wrote on Twitter 'the night attack in Grozny looks senseless, except as an attempt to embarrass (Russian president Vladimir) Putin hours before his annual address to parliament.' Mr Putin, who is to give his state of the nation address on Thursday, already was under pressure to reassure Russians as fears grow over soaring inflation and a plummeting ruble. A fresh outbreak of violence could further damage Mr Putin, who has been able to claim success in subduing Chechnya's Islamic insurgency after years of violence and two full-scale wars. But militant jihadist group the Caucasus Emirate, which follows a hardline Salafist Muslim ideology, has continued to launch attacks despite Chechen separatists officially ending their armed resistance.

Gunfire: Shell casings lie on the floor close to the burned out building after the fierce battle this morning .

Solidarity: The women put their arms around each other as they contemplate what they've lost in the violence . In Moscow: Chechen regional leader Ramzan Kadyrov, center, talks with the media after Russian President Vladimir Putin gave his annual state of the nation address in the Kremlin in Moscow earlier today . The Kavkaz Center website, a mouthpiece for Islamic militant groups operating in Russia's North Caucasus, carried a link to a video message by an individual claiming responsibility for the attacks. The man in the video claimed to be operating under orders from Chechen Islamist leader Aslan Byutukayev, known to his followers as Emir Khamzat. A few years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Chechnya was plunged into a full-scale war when separatist rebels pursued independence for the republic. The violence was largely confined to that small republic, but rebels ventured into other parts of Russia. A fragile peace settlement was reached with Moscow until 1999, when an insurgency movement increasingly inspired by radical Islamist ideas reignited the conflict. A military crackdown succeeded by years of aggressive rule by Mr Kadyrov has quietened the region, pushing unrest to neighbouring provinces. Mr Kadyrov has been widely denounced for human rights abuses, including allegations of killing opponents. He has also imposed some Islamic restrictions on the region, including mandatory public headscarves for women. After two bloody wars and a violent separatist movement, Chechnya has in recent years seen a period of relatively quiet. That calm was punctured this morning when a group of gunmen went on the rampage in the Russian republic's capital, shooting dead at least three police officers. The Chechen struggle for independence goes back to the fall of the Soviet Union, when local leaders formed an independence movement opposed to Boris Yeltsin's vision for a Russian Federation. The First Chechen War began in 1994 when Russian forces marched in to regain control over Chechnya following a 1991 declaration of independence. They faced serious opposition and, despite superiority in numbers and weaponry, and finance from the U.S., Russian forces were unable to establish control and Yeltsin signed a peace treaty in 1997. But despite the Chechen victory, that war displaced nearly half a million people and obliterated the country's infrastructure, while Islamists continued their insurgency against the new government. In October 1999 the Russian army again marched in, responding to an attack by the Islamic International Brigade on the neighbouring republic of Dagestan and a string of terror attacks in Russian cities, including Moscow. This time the invasion was much better planned and executed and, despite continuing terror attacks including the notorious Beslan school massacre, Russian public opinion held firm and the Kremlin tightened its grip. In 2003 a referendum was held on a new Chechen constitution reuniting the country with Russia. It was passed with 95.5 per cent of the vote on a claimed turnout of 80 per cent, numbers regarded sceptically by many observers. Russia finally pulled out in 2009 and ended its counter-terrorism operation. Three months later the leader of the separatist movement called for a halt for armed resistance. Islamist-inspired attacks continue, however.","More gunmen found in school and operation launched to 'liquidate' them .

Self's daughter however, Ashley Wagner, is disputing these claims, and demanding that her mother be released from jail. Wagner says her mother was always present and that the home was not as 'filthy' as authorities are claiming, this even though photos from the scene seem to back up their claims. Trash is everywhere, there is no room to walk, and the conditions to not look at all livable for anyone, let alone an elderly person.

"Bryn Parry-Jones was given a £90,000 Porsche as part of his contract with Pembrokeshire Council . A shamed council boss, who was provided with a Porsche Panamera as part of his contract, allowed his wife and two sons to drive the supercar. Bryn Parry-Jones, 62, received the £90,000 sports car to drive to and from work despite having to sanction massive cuts in public services. However, it has now emerged that Mr Parry-Jones, who received a £280,000 severance package after leaving Pembrokeshire Council earlier this year, was entitled to let his family use the taxpayer funded car. According to The Daily Express, Pembrokeshire Council, which is run by the Independent Plus Group, said that under the terms of the deal, the leased car would be available to Mr Parry-Jones' family. A spokesman said: 'The families of all council employees who lease cars are entitled to drive those vehicles under the authority's motor insurance policy. 'We are unable to conform or deny that the son of Mr Bryn Parry-Jones drove the vehicle in question. 'Had he done so, however, he would have been covered for insurance purposes with no additional cost incurred as a result.' Details of the taxpayer-funded Porsche were kept hidden for eight months. The council refused to reveal the perk, despite repeated information requests by journalists, for eight months – citing ‘privacy’ reasons. Last night the former chief executive was facing a growing row over his use of public money after details of his lavish lifestyle were exposed. Mr Parry-Jones, whose £195,000-a-year salary made him the highest-earning official in Wales, has been repeatedly accused of abusing taxpayers’ money while heading cash-strapped Pembrokeshire County Council. Earlier this year he was handed a £280,000 ‘golden goodbye’ despite the fact he had been forced to quit over an unlawful payments scandal. Details of his car, a perk which cost around £900-a-month to lease, only emerged this week after a long Freedom of Information battle with the council. Insiders said the extravagant expense had ‘stuck in the craw’ of cash-strapped council workers who knew about it for months. Campaigners and politicians hit out at the ‘offensive waste of money’ at a time when the council was making cuts to local services. Earlier this year, Pembrokeshire Council revealed it would have to make savings of £20million over two years. Proposed measures include closing public toilets, charging for social services and increasing parking fees. Council tax rose by 3.4 per cent this year. Stephen Crabb, Welsh secretary and Pembrokeshire MP, said: ‘These kinds of lavish car deals for council officials, alongside salary and other perks, stick in the throats of people – especially at a time when there is huge pressure on spending.’ The average salary in the county last year was £21,587. Jonathan Isaby, of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, added: ‘At a time when the council is trying to find savings, it’s particularly galling that local residents have been taken for such an extortionate ride.’ Mr Parry-Jones, who led the council for 18 years, was given an allowance to run a company car as part of his generous remuneration package. It is understood he took out a lease on the hybrid electric Porsche Panamera in March this year. Journalists first began requesting details of the car under the Freedom of Information Act in April, but the council said it must be kept secret because it was ‘private’. The Porsche Panamera, similar to this one, was leased by the council at a cost of £900-a-month . The council confirmed that Mr Parry-Jones' wife and two sons would have been covered by insurance . It was only this week, after he left with his enormous pay out, that the council, run by the Independent Plus Group, revealed details. Conservative councillor David Bryan said the Porsche was known about within the council and had ‘stuck in the craw’ of council workers facing ‘drastic pay cuts’. Paul Miller, who leads the opposition Labour group on the council, added: ‘He was a dictator and it got to the point where he thought he could do whatever he wanted.’ A council spokesman said: ‘Mr Bryn Parry-Jones was entitled to a lease car as part of his remuneration package.’ Mr Parry-Jones quit his post as chief executive in October, ten months after it was revealed he received more than £45,000 in cash payments in lieu of pension contributions. The Wales Audit Office said the payments were ‘unlawful’, although a police investigation concluded that no further action should be taken. Mr Parry-Jones finally stepped down after a vote of no confidence from the council – though councillors voted through a sizeable severance package. Mr Miller applied in vain for a High Court injunction against the pay-off. The council also said it would not be trying to reclaim the £45,606 cash payment.","Bryn Parry-Jones oversaw thousands of cuts at Pembrokeshire Council .

"Cardinal George Pell (pictured) has revealed millions of Euros have been found 'tucked away' off official balance sheets . The Vatican squirrelled away hundreds of millions of pounds in secret accounts, Pope Francis' minister for finance has revealed. Australian Cardinal George Pell said that millions of euros had been found 'tucked away' off official balance sheets in governing departments' accounts, following a clean up of the Vatican's shadowy finances. The bombshell statement follows the long overdue introduction of Vatican guidelines for modern accounting earlier this month. The Cardinal was appointed by Pope Francis to clean up the Vatican's murky finances after a series of scandals involving the Vatican Bank which was suspected of money laundering. The unexpected windfall meant that the Vatican finances were healthier than previously thought, Pell wrote in an article for the Catholic Herald. 'In fact, we have discovered that the situation is much healthier than it seemed, because some hundreds of millions of euros were tucked away in particular sectional accounts and did not appear on the balance sheet,' he wrote. Vatican departments were untroubled by modern accounting norms and had long had 'an almost free hand' with their finances, he wrote. They had a 'long-established' tradition of managing their own affairs, he wrote. 'Very few were tempted to tell the outside world what was happening, except when they needed extra help.' 'It was impossible for anyone to know accurately what was going on overall.' Pell claimed that the financial reforms had achieved their aim and there was no chance of a return to the 'bad old days'. Following his election last year, Francis immediately began major reforms to bring the Vatican into line with international standards on transparency and money laundering. In January he sacked four cardinals – including former Secretary of State, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone – from a five-member commission that oversees the Vatican bank.

"A well-known female television personality has today told how she was left 'frustrated' by police officers probing a stalker who had sent her emails about murdered presenter Jill Dando. The household name slammed the handling of her case, saying some officers 'didn't have the faintest idea' of how to deal with 'cases involving harassment against women'. The well-known presenter, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said she was left 'repulsed' after her stalker allegedly kissed her on the cheek at an event at the O2 arena, London. The well-known TV presenter, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has criticised the police handing of her case after she was kissed on the cheek by her stalker (pictured, face pixelated) at the O2 Arena last year . She claims the man asked her for an autograph while she was waiting to go on stage with her colleagues last year, before he leaned in for a kiss which left her 'smeared with saliva'. The stalker, who also cannot be identified, had previously bombarded the woman with hundreds of tweets and a stream of emails, claiming they were having a 'cyber affair'. He also urged her to leave her husband and marry him instead, the court was told. Giving evidence at Blackfriars Crown Court this morning, the celebrity criticised the police response to the alleged sex assault. She said: 'I was frustrated by the pace of the police investigation. 'The officers who brought the case to court have been excellent, but there were officers before who I have to say didn't have the faintest idea of how to handle cases involving harassment against women.' She told the jury she was moments away from joining other big names on stage for the charity event at the O2 arena in east London when the approached her. She said: 'He lunged at me with such a wet kiss - I had to wipe it off afterwards. Saliva was smeared across my cheek. The woman, who is a household name, told Blackfriar's Crown Court (pictured) that some officers 'didn't have the faintest idea of how to handle cases involving harassment against women' 'I felt humiliated, not only has he come in to make close contact, he has smeared this saliva on my cheek. I felt repulsed by it.' The presenter made the claims during cross-examination by Karen Walton, defending, who suggested the kiss was an innocent 'peck on the cheek' or 'a very flamboyant air kiss.' However, the celebrity replied: 'He has written in emails how he wants to be my cyber husband, he wants to marry me and be my husband.

"These extraordinary images from ISIS-held territory show militants piling cigarettes and alcohol onto a bonfire in a crackdown on banned goods. Jihadists have banned drinking and smoking in occupied territories in Iraq and Syria because it is against the harsh form of Sharia law they impose. The pictures show men piling up dozens of bottles of whisky, cans of beer and hundreds of cartons of cigarettes before setting fire to the lot while waving the black flag of ISIS and wielding assault rifles. Scroll down for video . Extraordinary pictures show ISIS militants piling hundreds of cartons of cigarettes, as well as a haul of alcohol, onto a bonfire and setting it alight . Banned: Dozens of confiscated bottles of whisky, vodka and other spirits, as well as cans of beer, were thrown onto the flames . Up in smoke: ISIS has banned smoking and drinking because it is against the harsh form of Sharia law it imposes in occupied territory in Syria and Iraq . Jihadists waved the black flag of ISIS as they made a pyre with the cigarettes and alcohol, prohibited in parts of Syria and Iraq they control . As part of the terror group's 'repent or die' rules imposed on towns and cities it overruns, smoking and drinking are strictly banned. Militants were seen smashing bottles of expensive spirits before using the flammable liquids as fuel for the large fire, believed to be near Tikrit, Iraq. Citizens of Mosul, in northern Iraq, were told after ISIS took over the stronghold: 'No drugs, no alcohol and no cigarettes allowed.' Earlier this year in Raqqa, Syria, gunmen seized a vast haul of tobacco just days after they arrived in the city, taking all the cigarettes they could find in shops and setting them alight on a giant pyre. A statement from the jihadists said: 'Every smoker should be aware that with every cigarette he smokes in a state of trance and vanity he is disobeying god.' A French ISIS member who moved to Syria in 2012 was jailed in November after returning to France because he could not face the terror group's smoking ban. Flames: The sight echoed scenes earlier this year in Raqqa, Syria, earlier this year, where the terror group seized alcohol from shops and bars before setting fire to it just days after their takeover of the city . Jihadists have previously told citizens in Raqqa: 'Every smoker should be aware that with every cigarette he smokes in a state of trance and vanity he is disobeying god' The ban on booze in ISIS-controlled areas has put up the price of alcohol across Iraq as delivery trucks take long detours to avoid crossing paths with the terror group . Hundreds of cartons of cigarettes were set on fire. One French jihadists was jailed in Paris in November after returning to France because he could not deal with the militants' ban on smoking . Flavien Moreau, 27, was the first French citizen to be tried for joining ISIS and was sentenced to seven years jail by a court in Paris. Moreau tried chewing nicotine gum but  returned to France after just two weeks in Syria because of he could not deal with the strict ban on cigarettes. According to The Week, Moreau told the court: 'I really struggled with not smoking. It was forbidden by the katiba [group of Islamist militants]. I had brought Nicorette gum with me, but it wasn't enough. I left my gun with my emir and I left.' However, in September, ISIS made a U-turn on their draconian ban on smoking in Kirkuk province Iraq, allowing people to buy cigarettes to boost their popularity. The ban on booze is said to have had a detrimental effect on the Iraqi economy, as alcohol deliveries to shops and bars in areas not held by ISIS are forced to take massive detours to avoid running into the jihadists. According to RT, cans of Heineken now cost $5, up from $1, and bottles of whisky have more than trebled in price since ISIS entered the country. Shi'ite militia were also reported to be demanding $15,000 bribes to ensure the safety of delivery trucks, further adding to the cost of transporting alcohol to more liberal cities, such as the capital Baghdad.","ISIS jihadists pictured piling up hundreds of cartons of cigarettes and bottles of expensive spirits onto a bonfire .

"A shocked woman claims to have found a mouse foot in a Lidl mince pie - after tucking into the festive treat. Kathie O'Connor made the grisly find in a £1.49 box of the supermarket's Luxury Mince Pies that she bought in Harpurhey, Manchester. The 58-year-old said she was down to her last bite of the first pie out of the box when she felt the  inch-long object in her mouth. Kathie O'Connor holding what she believes is a mouse foot, that she claims to have found inside a Lidl mince pie . 'It's about an inch long, gristly and ghastly, ' she said. 'The more I think about it the sicker I feel because I don't know what it is. To me it looks like a mouse's foot. This is the grisly object that Ms O'Connor claims to have found inside the festive treat . 'I was down to the last bite of my pie when I felt something hard in my mouth and then I pulled that out. 'It was my first mince pie of the year and it will be my last one.' After finding the bone-like object in the first pie of the box Ms O'Connor complained to Lidl. She has been told to send the pies, packaging and the mysterious item back to the store so they can work out what it is. 'That has really put me off, I might try a mince pie next Christmas but that is it for me this year,' she said. 'I can't get it out of my head that it's a mouse's foot.

"Treasure hunters are raising a glass or two after they discovered a couple of bottles of classic wine dating back to before the Second World War while they were exploring a Nazi bunker. Exploring the cramped maze of Third Reich of tunnels near Swinoujscie, a city in north-western Poland, the pair of local history buffs stumbled across a narrow corridor which had not been entered for around 70-years. Poking around, they found an old helmet, some uniform buttons and hidden in a rotten box containing ammunition, two bottles of 1930s Bordeaux wine. In the cramped entrance to a Nazi bunker where they made the discovery, a Polish treasure hunter holds the vintage wine he found near Swinoujscie, a city in north-western Poland . The red 1938 Chateaux Grand Barrail Lamarzelle and the white 1939 Chateau Latour-Matillac were found hidden in a rotten wooden ammunition box . The pair had to squeeze through a tight entrance to get into the maze of tunnels used by the Third Reich during the war . One is a red 1938 Chateaux Grand Barrail Lamarzelle, while the other is a white 1939 Chateau Latour-Matillac. The pair declined to be named in local media. Experts are divided on whether the wine would be pleasant on the pallet or little more than vinegar. Polish sommelier Tomasz Kolecki Majewicz, 49, said that the temperature underground would make the bunker would have preserved the wines perfectly, adding that he thought if they were opened the vintages would taste fantastic. The entrance to the bunker was well camouflaged. Inside they also found a soldier's helmet and some uniform buttons . Polish Sommelier Tomasz Kolecki Majewic thinks the temperature inside the bunker would have been perfect for preserving the wine, making it perfectly drinkable if the bottles are ever opened . Others were not convinced. ""I personally think it probably isn't worth drinking but there are still people that might want to take a punt,' said Izydor Wysock, 45. 'Of course there are those that would never want to open it and simply want to have such a historical bottle in their collection.' Even if the wine has gone off, it is thought the bottles would still fetch several hundred pounds at auction.","The find was made after the pair stumbled upon an old corridor .

"Ukrainians stood in long queues in the bleak snow as they waited to receive humanitarian aid in Donetsk yesterday. Lined up outside Donbass hockey stadium, hundreds of mainly elderly residents waited for the distribution of the aid packages, shipped across the border by Russia. Kiev has cut aid to the eastern regions held by pro-Russian rebels since soon after Western-backed protesters toppled Ukraine's pro-Moscow president in February. Humanitarian: People wait for aid packages in front of the Donbass hockey stadium in Donetsk, east Ukraine . Wrapped up warm: Those waiting for the emergency food packages were largely older residents . Life line: An old woman stands in the snow as she waits for the food aid shipped in by Russian agencies . Long queues: The east has been cut off since people refused to accept the new government in Kiev . Emergency packages: A woman picks up a bag of food aid as officials look on inside the stadium . Donetsk is a stronghold of resistance to the country's new government and has been under daily shelling despite a fresh truce hammered out this week between government troops and militants. Pictures from Donetsk have shown residential and official buildings alike shattered by artillery strikes, while Ukrainian officials accuse rebels of launching constant attacks from the city. Russia's aid convoys are a lifeline for civilians and militants alike. Kiev and Nato accuse them of being cover for material support for the insurgency, claiming that weapons are being shipped along with food supplies. Moscow denies using humanitarian convoys to transport weapons and rejects Western and Ukrainian accusations that it is arming the rebels and sending fighters to aid them. It accuses the West and Kiev of pressing a campaign of indiscriminate violence in the eastern territories of Luhansk and Donetsk. Today Russian President Vladimir Putin in a keynote speech said Ukraine had 'an inalienable, sovereign right' to its own path, but condemned what he described as a 'coup' that has brought the current government to power. 'What we are seeing now in Ukraine, the tragedy in the southeast, fully confirms that our position is right,' Mr Putin said. 'How can one support an armed seizure of power, violence, murder? 'How can one support the attempts that followed to suppress with the help of armed forces the people in the south-east who did not agree with this lawlessness? 'This is pure cynicism. I am sure that the Ukrainian nation itself will judge these events in a just way.' A Ukrainian army APC rolls into the village of Pisky, close to Donetsk airport - the scene of heavy fighting . Ukrainian army soldiers carry an ammunition belt with shells for the APC's armour-piercing gun . The men load the shells onto the back of a flat-bed truck decorated with the flag of Ukraine . Today U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Russia could rebuild its relations with the West 'if it simply helps to calm turbulent waters' on its border with eastern Ukraine. Mr Kerry spoke at a meeting of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which includes both the United States and Russia as partners. He met briefly - and separately - with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Georgian Foreign Minister Tamar Beruchashvili. The OSCE has sought to help broker an enduring cease-fire in eastern Ukraine, where the West says Moscow is supporting the separatists with weapons and troops in their quest to secede from Ukraine's central government. Mr Kerry called it a 'very turbulent year' and noted that when the 57-state OSCE met last year, Ukraine protesters were in the throes of demanding a new government in Kiev. 'They were warmed by a simple desire - to live in a country with an honest government,' Mr Kerry said at the start of the OSCE meeting. Over the past year, however, the fledgling leadership in Kiev has been beset by separatists in the eastern provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk, and has seen the Crimea region vote to secede. Women stand outside their damaged houses after overnight shelling in Donetsk's Makievsky district . Mr Kerry said Kiev has been 'tested by external aggression' yet still is 'casting off the shackles of repression and opening a new and promising chapter in their nation's history.' He called on Moscow to uphold an earlier cease-fire agreement, which calls for withdrawing its support for the separatists and persuading them to release hostages. The U.S. and European Union have imposed sanctions on some Russians and separatists as punishment for their actions. Russia accuses the U.S. and other Western nations of having backed the coup in Ukraine. This week a U.S. citizen was incredibly appointed as the country's new finance minister. Natalie Jaresko, who has worked in Ukraine for more than 20 years after holding various economic positions in the U.S. State Department, was approved in her new role on Tuesday. Ukraine has been offered billions by international lenders if it carries out economic reform and President Petro Poroshenko said the administration would benefit from international specialist input. Mr Kerry said it was the U.S. and its allies that supported Ukraine's sovereignty. 'It is not our design or desire that we see a Russia isolated through its own actions,' he said. 'No one gains from this confrontation.'","Donetsk has been under almost constant shelling attacks for months .

"John Tyler, the tenth president of the United States, was born in 1790. He grew up on a Virginia plantation, became a lawyer, and went on to the White House after the death of his predecessor, William Henry Harrison in 1841. In the years leading up to his presidency, horse-drawn carriages were the mode du jour, Arkansas, Michigan, Maine, and Missouri became states, and across the sea, Napoleon Bonaparte was conquering Europe. But it has been revealed that two of the president’s grandsons are still alive – and were born nearly 140 years after their grandfather was. The patriarch: US president John Tyler, who was born in 1790, has two living grandsons . Grandsons of a president: Harrison Ruffin Tyler, left, and his brother Lyon Gardiner Tyler Jr., call the tenth president of the United States their grandfather . Lyon Gardiner Tyler Jr. was born in 1924 to Lyon Gardiner Tyler, the son of the late president. His brother Harrison Ruffin was born four years later, according to records kept by the Sherwood Forest Plantation Foundation, the home of President Tyler. This extraordinary feat was possible in part because their father had Lyon and Harrison whilst in his 70s. Lyon Gardiner Tyler, Sr., after all, was born while the nation fought the Civil War. His two surviving sons were with his second wife, Sue Ruffin, who was born in 1889. The widower president John Tyler, who was dubbed ‘His Accidency’ for the unusual manner in which he won the presidency, rose to fame from the ‘Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too’ campaign. Extended family tree: Both President Tyler and his son Lyon were married twice - their second wives, both much younger than their husbands, help explain the incredible time gap . The middle man: Lyon Tyler, Sr., was born in 1853, remarried in 1923, and had two sons within the next five years . He married Julia Gardiner, a woman from a wealthy Long Island family, on July 23, 1844. She was 30 years his junior at 24. He was the first president to marry while holding office. The couple had seven children, added to eight more from President Tyler’s first marriage, making his the most prolific family to inhabit the White House. Lyon, Sr. had six children, according to his son’s biography. His son followed in his father’s footsteps and became an attorney, practicing law in Tennessee. Loving wife and mother: First Lady Julia Gardiner Tyler married the president at only 24, though he was 30 years her senior . Harrison, meanwhile, has led several historical tours, and was the keynote speaker for the 250th Jubilee of the colonial settlement of Jamestown. The three generations have seen a multitude of change. In 1842, the word ‘dinosaur’ was coined and three years later, Charles Darwin published Voyage of the Beagle. In Lyon Tyler's era, Theodore Roosevelt held office, the United Postal Service was founded, and a stone was laid to begin construction of the Washington National Cathedral. His grandsons have seen the advent of airplanes, television, and the internet. 29 March 1790: John Tyler born in Greenway, Virginia . 1807: graduated from William and Mary; Passed the Bar Exam and became lawyer two years later . March 1813: Married first wife Letitia Christian . 1811-1839: Served as United States representative, state governor and senator . 1841: Became president, known as ‘His Accidency’ after the sudden death of William Henry Harrison . 1853: Lyon Gardiner Tyler born; becomes historian . 18 January 1862: John Tyler dies, aged 71 . 10 July 1889: Julia Gardiner Tyler dies, aged 69 . 1923: Lyon Gardiner Tyler, Sr., marries second wife Sue Ruffin, two years after first wife dies . 1925: Lyon Gardiner Tyler Jr. born . 1928: Harrison Ruffin Tyler born . 12 February 1935: Lyon Gardiner Tyler Sr. dies, aged 81 .","John Tyler's wife Julia was 30 years his junior .

"A terrorist organisation claiming responsibility for a number of attacks in Pakistan has apparently become the first foreign extremist group to pledge their allegiance to the Islamic State currently wreaking havoc across Syria and Iraq. Tehreek-e-Khilafat has declared it will raise the flag of the Islamic State - formerly known as ISIS - above south Asia and Khurusan, an historical Islamic region comprising parts of Afghanistan, Iran, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The move will be seen to bolster Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State, who has garnered the nickname ‘the invisible sheikh’ due to his elusive nature. Pakistanie terror group Tehreek-e-Khilafat has declared it will  now support the Islamic State, which has seized vast parts of Syria and Iraq. Pictured, a member loyal to the Islamic State waves a flag in Raqqa, Syria . Described as the world’s most wanted man, militants operating under Baghdadi’s control have spread terror through Syria and Iraq in an attempt to form a new Islamic state in the Middle East. The Sunni fighters, responsible for the brutal slaughter of thousands, have vowed to expand the so-called caliphate to huge swathes of Europe and Africa. Tehreek-e-Khilafat, affiliated with the Pakistani Taliban, said in a statement: 'From today, Sheikh Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi shall consider Tehreek-e-Khilafat and Jihad mujahideen fighters of Pakistan as one of the arrows among his arrows which he has kept for his bow. The move will be seen as a boost for Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi . Murderous: Isis fighters force a prisoner to kneel before they execute him in front of a cheering crowd in Iraq . The statement, featured in the Daily Telegraph, added: 'We are praying from the almighty Allah to give us chance in our lives to see the expansion of Islamic State boundaries toward the Sub­Continent and Khurasan region in order to hoist the flag of Islamic State here.' The deadliness of Pakistani terror groups was brought home in March, when gunmen stormed Pakistan's main court complex in Islamabad on Monday, cutting down fleeing lawyers before blowing themselves up in a rampage that killed 11 people. It was the worst terror attack in years . in the capital, which has largely been spared the violence raging in . many parts of the country. Caliphate: A map purportedly showing the areas ISIS plans to have under its control within five years has been widely shared online . Saifullah Mehsud, of the Fata Research Centre which monitors activity in Pakistan's tribal areas, said more groups will now follow Tehreek-e-Khilafa and fall under the Islamic State's influence. He said: 'This seems to be the in thing now. If you monitor social media, as I do, all the talk is about the Islamic State rather than al-Qaeda.' ISIS, as it was known then, was disowned by al-Qaeda in February after defying demands that it stopp its operation in Syria.","Tehreek-e-Khilafat has now pledged its support to the Islamic State .

"She was a self-proclaimed hippy with a keen interest in women’s liberation, free love and the Pill. So it is perhaps not surprising that the young Julie Walters wasn’t a big fan of family values campaigner Mary Whitehouse. Now, at the age of 64, the actress has finally admitted Mrs Whitehouse was right all along. Despite once regarding her as a busybody intent on ruining everyone’s fun, she now feels Britain’s self-appointed moral guardian did the right thing by pushing for a TV watershed. Scroll down for video . Julie Walters (left) praised Mary Whitehouse (right) and her campaign for appropriate television for children this week after playing the woman in a 2008 film . Her comments come amid concern that the 9pm cut-off – designed to prevent children being exposed to violence, sex and swearing – is being abolished by stealth, with explicit content increasingly aired earlier in the evening. Miss Walters, who has an adult daughter called Maisie, said playing the late campaigner in a 2008 film called Filth: The Mary Whitehouse Story had made her understand the importance of the watershed. ‘It made me really like her,’ she said. ‘I thought, “Yes, you have a point. We do need a [watershed]”. And we did. She was right.’ The BAFTA-winning actress, who played Mrs Overall in Victoria Wood’s Acorn Antiques and starred in films including Educating Rita and Billy Elliot, was in her early 20s at the time of Mrs Whitehouse’s Clean Up TV campaign. She said: ‘Mary Whitehouse was at her height in about 1972. I was of the sixties generation – I was sort of 21, 22, 23. Of course, we all hated her because we were part of the revolution. The actress took on the role of Mary Whitehouse in a 2008 documentary about the campaigner's life . ‘Women’s lib had started, the Pill, free love, all that sort of thing.’ Speaking at a Bafta event earlier this week, Miss Walters added: ‘We were hippies, students, and there was Mary Whitehouse saying “No, it’s not right”. ‘She was my mother’s generation – we hated all that.’ In recent months, media campaign groups have warned of a ‘slippery slope’, with increasingly adult themes featuring in pre-watershed programmes. In particular, series such as The X Factor and Britain’s Got Talent have been criticised for screening raunchy early-evening performances by singers such as Jennifer Lopez and Rihanna. There is also concern about music videos that are available online and can be viewed by children of any age. Mrs Whitehouse was ridiculed by some as being out of touch after she railed against broadcasters and artists whose work she felt was obscene. Mrs Whitehouse founded the National Viewers' and Listeners' Association in 1965, using it as a platform to criticise the BBC for its perceived lack of accountability . In 1965 she founded the National Viewers’ and Listeners’ Association, using it as a platform to criticise the BBC for its perceived lack of accountability and excessive portrayals of sex, violence and bad language. At the time, she was loathed by liberals such as then BBC Director General Sir Hugh Carleton Greene, whom she once called the ‘devil incarnate’. But since her death aged 91 in 2001, a growing number of commentators have said her views on the dangers of broadcasting gratuitous sex and violence had been ahead of their time. In 2010 veteran broadcaster Dame Joan Bakewell, who fought for a new liberal age of freedom, admitted that she had come to agree with her one-time bête noire. Miss Walters was speaking at BAFTA 'A Life in Television'.

"Work has got under way to repaint the striking red and white stripes on a landmark lighthouse in East Sussex. In a campaign backed by Eddie Izzard, John Craven and Bill Bryson, more than £27,000 was raised to pay for the revamp of the Beachy Head lighthouse in Eastbourne, which has finally begun after a delay earlier in the week due to poor weather. The fundraising campaign was launched after Trinity House, which oversees shipping safety and navigational aids around Britain's coastline, said the lighthouse was no longer needed as a daymark - the reason for its eye-catching appearance. Bright: The Beachy Head Lighthouse near Eastbourne, Sussex, is being repainted this week . Hard at work: Engineers work at the top of the landmark to restore it to its former glory . Restoration: £27,000 was raised by campaigners, including Eddie Izzard, to work on the lighthouse . Consequently, its distinctive stripes were to be left to fade because of the cost of repainting it. However, locals stepped in to raise the money needed to give it a fresh look. Campaign co-ordinator Shirley Moth said: 'We have been thrilled by the support the campaign has received. 'Once we started it, we realised how many people have great affection for the lighthouse. 'It's a part of Sussex, and in the end we received support from all over the world, including donations from America and Canada.' The lighthouse has sat more than 500ft below the summit of the infamous chalk cliffs of Beachy Head since being brought into service in 1902. Supplies: Paint and more equipment is brought by boat to the lighthouse yesterday . Before and after: The landmark had been looking increasingly grey, left, but today looked much brighter, right . Designed under the direction of Sir Thomas Matthews, the then engineer-in-chief of Trinity House, it is made of 3,660 tonnes of fine Cornish granite. It was automated and de-manned in June 1983 and is monitored remotely 24 hours a day by Trinity House's operations and planning centre at Harwich, Essex. Trinity House has previously defended the decision not to repaint the lighthouse, saying it had a duty to ensure all its expenditure was justified. Support: Comedian Eddie Izzard, left, and author Bill Bryson, right, gave money to the campaign .

"European human rights judges rejected Former Labour Cabinet Minister Geoff Hoon's claims to have been unfairly treated by a Parliamentary inquiry . Former Labour Cabinet Minister Geoff Hoon suffered a fresh humiliation yesterday when European human rights judges rejected his claims to have been unfairly treated by a Parliamentary inquiry. Mr Hoon said Parliamentary authorities had been wrong to punish him after he was exposed trying to use his status as a former Defence Secretary to make large sums of money. But the European Court of Human Rights brusquely rejected the charges as ‘manifestly ill-founded’. The defeat meant the end of a legal battle lasting nearly five years that began when Mr Hoon was caught out by a newspaper sting in March 2010. Mr Hoon, who was still an MP at the time, went to a meeting with a company calling itself Anderson Perry Associates and discussed providing it with advice on defence matters. He told company executive Claire Perry that he was looking forward to ‘translating my knowledge and contacts about the sort of international scene into something that, bluntly, make money.’ He told Miss Perry that he charged £3,000 a day. But the consultancy was really a front for the Sunday Times and Channel 4’s Dispatches programme and Mr Hoon, who was at the time a special adviser to the Nato Secretary General, was one of a number of politicians targeted. Others included one-time Labour ministers Stephen Byers and Patricia Hewitt. Mr Hoon’s exposure was followed by a complaint by another MP to Parliamentary authorities, and an inquiry by the Commons Standards and Privileges Committee. The Committee called on Mr Hoon to apologise to the Commons, and it effectively banned him from the Palace of Westminster by withrawing his Parliamentary pass for five years. Mr Hoon, who was Defence Secretary from 1999 to 2005, and a Cabinet Minister until 2009, complained to the Strasbourg human rights court that the inquiry was not a fair trial and interfered with his civil rights, and that by damaging his reputation it had breached his right to a private and family life. Former cabinet minister Geoff Hoon, was secretly filmed (shown here) by the Channel 4 programme Dispatches over his apparent willingness to help a firm in return for cash . The Strasbourg judges, headed by Latvian Ineta Ziemele, said that Mr Hoon had no reason to complain that he did not get a fair hearing because the dispute was political and not a matter of his civil human rights. It said his complaint was inadmissible. It also rejected his complaint under Article Eight of the European human rights charter, which protects private and family life. The human rights court said that although the damage to his reputation caused by the inquiry might have breached his human rights, the Committee had followed the rules of the Commons. It said that while Mr Hoon had suffered damage to his reputation, it was more important to maintain freedom of speech.","Mr Hoon was was exposed trying to use his status as a former Defence Secretary to make large sums of money .

"War medals will be given a special exemption from inheritance tax under proposals buried in yesterday’s Autumn Statement. Until now awards for military service counted towards a person’s wealth when they die. But George Osborne yesterday scrapped the unpopular tax on military awards. War medals - including these Korea War medals - will be given a special exemption from inheritance tax under proposals buried in yesterday’s Autumn Statement . There was already an exemption for medals and other decorations awarded for ‘valour or gallantry’. The medals included the Victoria Cross, George Cross and Military Cross – but also awarded for gallantry overseas included the famous Legion d’Honneur and Croix de Guerre in France. The Turkish ‘Order of Medjidieh’ was also exempt. But from today ‘all decorations and medals awarded to the armed services or emergency services personnel’ will be exempt. OBEs and CBEs will also be exempt, the Treasury confirmed today. Death taxes of 40p in the £1 are paid on inherited wealth of anything more than £325,000. The Conservatives proposed raising the threshold to £1million before the 2010 election – but have failed to increase it since 2009. But Mr Osborne yesterday moved to exempt emergency workers, and humanitarian aid workers from future inheritance tax bills if they are killed in active service. Armed forces personnel who die in the line of duty are already exempt. George Osborne was at a Bentley factory in Crewe this morning after yesterday's Autumn Statement . The change covers anyone working for the police, fire, ambulance or the search and rescue services, and follows a government consultation launch in the summer. He has also extended it to all humanitarian aid workers aimed at those who have gone to west Africa to help fight the spread of Ebola. Inheritance tax currently hits around 16,000 families a year. But official forecasts have suggested the number of families paying inheritance tax will double over the next five years because of soaring house prices.","Until now awards for military service counted towards a person’s wealth .

"A 15-year-old girl has revealed how she escaped Isis militants by drugging and shooting two husbands who bought her as a slave. The teenager, who has been kept anonymous to protect her family, was one of hundreds of women from the Yazidi sect who extremists kidnapped after overrunning their homes on Iraq's Mount Sinjar. The women and girls were trafficked to Isis strongholds, where survivors say many were raped. The captives were said to include girls as young as five. Scroll down for video . Slavery: A 15-year-old girl (pictured) has told how she escaped Isis militants by drugging and shooting two husbands who bought her as a slave. She was one of hundreds of Yazidi women and girls who were abducted . Escape: As other Yazidis fled the militants in northern Iraq (pictured) in August, hundreds of women and girls were captured. Survivors said many were raped, while others said the captives included girls as young as five . Now one survivor has spoken to the Associated Press news agency from her Iraqi homeland, where she has returned to live with what is left of her family in a makeshift roadside shelter. Rocking back and forth as she spoke after asking her relatives to leave the room, she told a staggering tale of courage against the kidnappers - who are still holding her two sisters. Her father, other brothers and other male relatives have vanished, their fates unknown. First, she said, she and other girls were taken to the nearby town of Tal Afar, where she was kept in the Badosh Prison until U.S. air strikes began. The militants then moved her and many other girls to the city of Mosul, the biggest Isis stronghold in Iraq, before moving them again to a house in the militants' Syrian garrison of Raqqa. 'They took girls to Syria to sell them,' she said, her body hunched over as she spoke. 'I was sold in Syria. I stayed about five days with my two sisters, then one of my sisters was sold and taken (back) to Mosul, and I remained in Syria.' Displaced: Many Yazidi women from Sinjar, including the 15-year-old who was kidnapped, are still living in fear near the northern Iraqi town of Dahuk, pictured. (The Yazidi girl in this photo does not feature in this article) Grim: Yazidis who fled from Sinjar eat breakfast at a school-turned-shelter in Dahuk, 260 miles from Baghdad . Vulnerable: The Yazidi people who remain include many women and children. Hundreds were abducted by Isis . In Raqqa, she said, she was married off to a Palestinian man - who she shot after obtaining a gun from the man's aggrieved housekeeper. She fled, but had nowhere to run. So she went to the only place she knew - the house where she was first held with the other girls in Raqqa. The militants did not recognise her but sold her off again for $1,000 (£620) to a Saudi fighter, she said. She added: 'He told me, ""I'm going to change your name to Abeer, so your mother doesn't recognize you. '""You'll become Muslim, then I will marry you."" But I refused to become a Muslim and that's why I fled.' She said she escaped by pouring a powdered drug into tea which she served to the Saudi man and his accomplices, which made them fall asleep - allowing her to flee the house. This time she was more fortunate, and found a man who would drive her to Turkey to meet her brother. Once she arrived, her brother borrowed $2,000 (£1,250) from friends to pay a smuggler to get them both back to northern Iraq. They ended up in a tiny roadside hamlet just outside the Kurdish city of Dahuk, where several other Yazidi families are staying. The girl was among hundreds of Yazidi women and girls who Iraq's Human Rights Ministry said were  captured when Mount Sinjar was overrun in August. The plight of the ancient religious sect, whose members are considered devil-worshippers by the militants, sparked international outcry - and was a turning point in the West's assault on Isis. Outcry: Images of Yazidi people fleeing Mount Sinjar in August (pictured) proved a turning point in the conflict . Exodus: The U.S. and Britain made aid drops to thousands of the Yazidi people who had been trapped . It prompted a string of humanitarian aid drops by Britain and the U.S. which gave way to air strikes just a few weeks later. Other Yazidi kidnapping victims who spoke to the Associated Press said the militants deprived them of enough food, water or even a place to sit. They all reported seeing dozens of other Yazidi women and children as young as five in captivity, and they all said that they have relatives who are still missing. Amsha Ali, a 19-year-old, agreed to waive her right to anonymity to speak of her terrifying ordeal. She was six months pregnant when she was dragged off in Sinjar, where the last she saw of her husband was him lying on the ground about to be shot. She and other women were taken to a house full of Islamic State fighters in Mosul, and each of them were married off. 'Each of them took one of us for themselves,' she said. New battle: The latest fighting has been in the Syrian border town of Kobane, a stone's throw from Turkey . Squalid: The rampage of Isis through Iraq and Syria has produced hundreds of thousands of refugees. Pictured are Kurdish refugees today in a camp in the town of Suruc, Turkey, as fighting hit the border town of Kobane . Vulnerable: Kurdish refugees from Syria today in a 'tent city' on the outskirts of the Turkish town of Suruc . She too was given to a fighter, but unlike other women she saw she was never raped by the man, possibly because she was pregnant. After a few weeks she escaped by slipping out of a bathroom window at night and fleeing to nearby Kurdish territory with the help of a good Samaritan who saw her in the streets of Mosul. She said she tried to convince other women to flee with her, but they were too afraid. 'Because they were so terrified, they are left there and now I know nothing about them,' she said. She is now with her father and a surviving sister in an unfinished building in the town of Sharia, where some 5,000 Yazidi refugees live. 'The killing was not the hardest thing for me,' she said. 'Even though they forced my husband, brother-in-law and father-in-law on the ground to be murdered. The latest Syrian Kurdish refugees in Turkey (pictured) are among hundreds of thousands who have fled Isis . Uncertain future: Syrian Kurds taking shelter in Turkey. Isis has rampaged through huge regions of Iraq and Syria murdering thousands of people in the name of an extremist Sunni Islamic 'caliphate' 'It was painful - but marrying (the militant) was the worst. It was hardest thing for me.' This week Iraq's only Yazidi MP was given an award for campaigning for her people, including the 30,000 who were trapped on the mountainside in August. Vian Dakhil broke her leg in a helicopter crash while personally delivering aid to Yazidis on Mount Sinjar. 'We are peaceful people, but our men are being butchered, and our women and girls are being tortured, raped and taken as slaves, she said. 'I must make the world aware that there are still people who want to rule with the laws of the Dark Ages, by forcing us to change religion or be killed.' The terror group, which now calls itself Islamic State, has swept through huge regions of Iraq and Syria murdering thousands of people in the name of an extremist Sunni Islamic 'caliphate'. A fierce battle has been fought in the Syrian border town of Kobane, just a few hundred yards from Turkey, where it is feared the militants will soon seize overall control.","Girl, who has been kept anonymous, rocked back and forth as she told story .

"A cash-strapped tradesman who was found guilty of murdering a Sydney woman at her waterfront mansion has been sentenced to a maximum of 24 years behind bars. Shahnaz Qidwai's husband, daughters and son cried and embraced in court after the sentence was handed down while her killer Tony Halloun stood expressionless. The labourer, who was hired to concrete the Qidwais' driveway in 2012, had asked for $3,500 but Dr Khalid Qidwai refused to pay him before the job was done. The next day, Shahnaz Qidwais was found bludgeoned to death in her multi-million-dollar home in Henley, in Sydney's north-west. A NSW Supreme Court previously heard Halloun killed Mrs Qidwai, 65, and stole more than $3,000 from the family home. It took just two hours for the jury in September to unanimously find the tradesman guilty of murder. Her body was discovered by her youngest daughter Maha on her bedroom floor, her face and mouth covered in blood and bruises. Scroll down for video . Dr Khalid Qidwai and his children outside a NSW Supreme Court in Sydney on Friday after the sentencing of Tony Halloun . Dr Khalid Qidwai and his children cried and embraced when the sentencing was handed down in court . Tony Halloun has been found guilty of murdering Shahnaz Qidwai on June 15, 2012 . Grandmother Shahnaz Qidwai (pictured here with husband Dr Khalid Qidwai) was found bludgeoned to death in her harbourside home in 2012 . It took the jury two hours to find Tony Halloun guilty of murdering Mrs Qidwai (far right) who was 65 years old . In sentencing Halloun on Friday, Justice Lucy McCallum said this 'grim experience has cast a haunting veil over her (Maha's) memories of her mother'. It was clear Mrs Qidwai was an extraordinary woman, full of warmth and kindness and that her family 'will always ache' for her, she added. Halloun, Justice McCallum said, had taken advantage of this kindness on the day of Mrs Qidwai's death by getting her to allow him into the home. Once inside, the financially-stressed Halloun rummaged through the envelopes of cash kept by Mrs Qidwai. While no one could say for certain what happened next, Justice McCallum said she was satisfied Mrs Qidwai probably happened upon Halloun doing something wrong and he attacked her 'out of panic'. 'I am satisfied that the offender formed an intention to steal from the house but I doubt he intended to kill Mrs Qidwai,' she said. Halloun has shown no remorse and told many lies, including one 'bizarre tale' that he had seen masked intruders holding Mrs Qidwai at gunpoint on the day of her death. 'His apparent inability to accept responsibility for (the murder) in the face of an overwhelming circumstantial case may come down to a question of pride or an inability to say out loud that he did such a terrible thing.' But, she said, up until the murder, Halloun had led a good life and that the offence was out of character. She sentenced the 35-year-old to a maximum of 24 years and a minimum of 17. Taking into account time already served, he will be eligible for parole in August 2029. Halloun was led out of court in a pair of handcuffs as he covered his face from cameras in September . Two years ago, the concreter went to the doctor's surgery on June 14 and asked for $3,500 but Dr Qidwai refused to pay before the job was done. Halloun became aggressive, the court heard, and used the chilling words: 'I'll win in the end'. The next day, Mrs Qidwai wasfound bludgeoned to death in her multi-million-dollar Henley home - in Sydney's north-west - following the bitter feud. It took a NSW Supreme Court jury just two hours in September to find Tony Halloun guilty of the murder of Shahnaz Qidwai in her Henley home on June 15, 2012. The victim's widower Dr Khalid Qidwai and their adult children wept as the jury handed down its decision while the detective who led the investigation wiped away tears. Halloun showed no emotion as he removed his tie and was led from the dock. One of his supporters sat with mouth agape and head bowed. Halloun's trial heard he was nearly $100,000 in debt at the time of the killing and had repeatedly asked Dr Qidwai for cash. Dr Khalid Qidwai and his children speak to the media after the sentencing of Tony Halloun . The following day Dr Qidwai's wife, Shahnaz Qidwai, 65, was found bashed to death in their multi-million dollar waterfront home in Henley, in north-west Sydney . During the trial, which began in August, crown prosecutor Giles Tabuteau  (pictured) said Halloun took $3,400 from the home . Mr Tabuteau said Halloun fabricated three different versions of events in order to explain DNA and crime scene evidence .","Tony Halloun was hired to concrete Dr Khalid Qidwai's driveway in Henley .

"David Johnston has to be dumped as Defence Minister now - that's the view of former Liberal leader Dr John Hewson. Dr Hewson told Daily Mail Australia that Mr Johnston was 'in real strife' and Tony Abbott had to act to stop what is 'a festering sore going into the festive season'. 'You have to nip that in the bud as fast as you can, otherwise all you have is instability and uncertainty' he said. Defence Minister David Johnston has been embroiled in two recent controversies, revelations he indulged in a series of expensive meals with industry officials chasing lucrative government contracts and comments made that he wouldn't trust Australian Submarine Corp to 'build canoes' Dr John Hewson, former Liberal leader, said: 'Defence has a history of being able to eat their own - we've seen it before - I think he's in real strife and I think the sooner that Abbott deals with the fact that he's not competent to be a Minister of Defence' Dr John Hewson was the leader of the Liberal Party for four years in the 90s, contesting one federal election . 'Tony Abbott may have confidence in Johnston but that leak about expenses suggests to me defence doesn't have confidence in him. 'Defence has a history of eating their own, we've seen that before happy to others - I think he (Johnston) is in real strife and I think the sooner that Abbott deals with the fact that he's not competent to be a Minister of Defence the better.' He warned that if the PM didn't take action 'it will be a festering sore into the festive season and it will only get worse.' He also took a swipe at the Prime Minister's assertion that a Cabinet reshuffle was on the cards. 'It's silly, if you are going to say that, the expectation there is that it is going to happen and the pressure grows for it to happen, so I guess it's better to have it sooner rather than later - you can't have it too late.' The Prime Minister has had to put out internal fires on several fronts, including a confrontation with Deputy Liberal Leader Julie Bishop over plans to have her 'chaperoned' at the UN climate conference . Julie Bishop is believed to have pushed back on the plan to have her accompanied to the United Nations Climate Conference by Andrew Robb . 'That was really dumb to attack her'. John Hewson thinks Tony Abbott made a big mistake in his move to have Julie Bishop 'chaperoned' at the UN meeting by Andrew Robb . Dr Hewson called Mr Abbott's planned move to have Foreign Minister Julie Bishop 'chaperoned' at the UN Climate Conference as dumb. 'That was really dumb to attack her,' he  said, agreeing that she, along with Immigration Minister Scott Morrison, were the star performers in Cabinet this past year. 'That's right, and she recognises the inevitability of the fact that next year in the course of the run-up to the Paris meeting that the world is going to move towards an emissions reduction target and we should be part of that process, it means the government has to change some of its policy,' Dr Hewson added. 'Tony would be dismayed that the government has had success in foreign affairs and immigration, things like MH17 for instance but that he would be 10 points behind in the polls and not the preferred Prime Minister,' Dr Hewson said. Treasurer Joe Hockey has, meantime tried to brush aside claims some colleagues want him dumped, in favour of Malcolm Turnbull. When asked on Radio 3AW whether Joe Hockey was safe as treasurer, the PM replied 'of course, of course' .. going on to call him a man of 'remarkable resilience, focus and grit'. Under pressure. There are increasing calls for David Johnston to be dumped as Defence Minister but the Prime Minister is sticking by him . Under pressure. There are reports senior Cabinet members are angling for Joe Hockey's removal as Treasurer in favour of Malcolm Turnbull but he too has the PM's support . 'I rate Joe very highly indeed and the public should do too,' he told reporters on Friday. 'He has tackled this (the Budget) with a will, with a purpose, with a single mindedness and strength of character.' Asked in an interview with the ABC's 7.30 program whether it was time to reshape the Coalition front-bench, Mr Abbott said: 'At some stage between now and the next election, quite probably, but this is a good front-bench.' 'Joe Hockey has been criticised lately, but I tell you what, I think Joe is going to be one of the great treasurers because he's someone who bounces back and that's what he's doing now,' Mr Abbott said. 'Joe Hockey has been criticised lately, but I tell you what, I think Joe is going to be one of the great treasurers because he's someone who bounces back and that's what he's doing now,' Mr Abbott said . Mr Hockey also dismissed as 'silly' the questions about his future. He is due to hand down his mid-year budget review within the next fortnight. Dr Hewson said if he was either David Johnston or Joe Hockey, he would be very uncomfortable at hearing they had the Prime Minister's backing. 'Maybe I'm a bit cynical but I would be worried if I was Johnston or Hockey to hear that the Prime Minister say he has absolute confidence in them, many times that can turn out negative,' he to Daily Mail Australia. Daily Mail Australia has sought comment from Mr Johnston, his office again stressing that he continues to have the PM's support.","Reports of a cabinet in chaos with doubts over David Johnston, Joe Hockey and even the PM under pressure .

"Prosecutors are to re-examine 25 criminal convictions where evidence was given by 'Fake Sheikh' Mazher Mahmood. The Crown Prosecution Service said it was also no longer offering evidence on three live cases involving the undercover reporter, as there was 'no longer a realistic prospect of a conviction'. The CPS announced the probe after reviewing the prosecutions in the wake of the collapse of the trial of former X-Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos in July, and the conviction of rapper Mike GLC, real name Michael Coombs. Prosecutors are to re-examine 25 criminal convictions where evidence was given by 'Fake Sheikh' Mazher Mahmood . The reporter's elaborate set-ups led to the exposure of dozens of people, from hapless royals to hardened criminals while he worked for the now defunct News of the World. He is pictured while posing as a Sheikh in the 1990s . A CPS spokesman said: 'Following the halting of the trial of Ms Contostavlos and Mr Coombs we took steps to identify current and past cases involving Mr Mahmood as a prosecution witness. 'We made it our immediate priority to carefully look into live prosecutions in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors and any past cases which involved a defendant still in custody. 'There were no concluded cases where a defendant was still in custody, but we identified three live cases; each case was looked at individually and no evidence was offered as we concluded that there was no longer a realistic prospect of a conviction. 'We are now considering past cases which resulted in a conviction in criminal courts in England and Wales based on evidence provided by Mr Mahmood, and have identified 25 cases. As part of this process, over the coming weeks, CPS Areas will be contacting representatives of the defendants – or defendants themselves as necessary - convicted in these cases in order to provide them with a disclosure pack – details of material which they may consider undermines the conviction in a specific case.' The CPS announced the probe after reviewing the prosecutions in the wake of the collapse of the trial of former X-Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos in July, and the conviction of rapper Mike GLC . Mr Mahmood, a former reporter for the News of the World, was suspended by the Sun on Sunday after the collapse of Contostavlos's trial. The former N-Dubz star went on trial after allegedly boasting that she could 'sort out' cocaine for Mr Mahmood and put the reporter in touch with her rapper friend Mr Coombs. But both were cleared after Judge Alistair McCreath said there were 'strong grounds' to believe Mahmood lied in the witness box and 'had been manipulating the evidence'. In September, several trials at Southwark Crown Court in London were halted because they relied on evidence from the undercover reporter. The CPS offered no evidence against Dr Majeed Ridha and pharmacist Murtaza Gulamhusein, who were accused of illegally supplying an abortion drug. And fixer to the stars Leon 'Starino' Anderson and co-defendant Ashley Gordon, 21, had drugs charges dismissed after prosecutors said Mr Mahmood was not reliable. In terms of cases that resulted in convictions, the CPS said it was providing information to defence teams to 'allow them to consider whether there is any basis for their client's case to be referred to the Court of Appeal or to the Criminal Case Review Commission (CCRC)'. Disclosure packs are also being sent to the Law Society, CCRC 'and relevant regulatory bodies that we are aware of and who have had cases involving Mr Mahmood', it said. In November, the undercover journalist was unmasked in a BBC documentary, despite an 11th hour attempt by him to block the broadcaster from showing his image. The Panorama programme, featuring up-to-date pictures of the 'Fake Sheikh', heard from former celebrity stings and associates of Mr Mahmood, who claimed that he set them up and targeted them unfairly. Among them was former London's Burning actor and child star John Alford, who spent nine months in prison after he claims Mr Mahmood entrapped him into supplying cocaine.","Reporter's elaborate set-ups led to the exposure of dozens of celebrities .

"Sally Anne Bowman's mother today spoke of her anger at Spanish police after discovering that they had a chance to catch her daughter's killer years before he murdered her. Indisputable DNA evidence has emerged that links Mark Dixie, currently serving a life sentence for the 2005 murder of 18-year-old Sally in Croydon, to a rape and two sex assaults in the Costa Del Sol in 2003. A Dutchman was jailed for the crimes in 2005 without forensic evidence. His lawyer strongly believes he was wrongly convicted. Tragic: Linda Bowman (right) has expressed her anger at the Spanish police, who she believes could have apprehended Mark Dixie before he murdered her daughter, Sally (left), if they'd used DNA evidence . Linda Bowman says she is dismayed at the thought that if the Spanish authorities had investigated the case more thoroughly, her daughter might still be alive. She told MailOnline: 'I am absolutely appalled. An innocent man has spent 11 years of a 16 year sentence in prison for a crime he did not do. 'I feel very strongly that if the Spanish authorities had done their jobs properly, my Sally Anne would be alive. 'He did not assault those three women in Spain - Sally Anne's killer did. He is someone's son and he is locked up for something he didn't do.' The man serving time for the attacks in Spain is 41-year-old Romano Van der Dussen. He's served 11 years of a 16-year sentence for the crimes, despite forensic evidence linking Dixie to the rape emerging almost eight years ago, after Interpol sent his DNA to police forces across Europe. Official documents – seen by MailOnline – show that DNA found on the Spanish rape victim in an examination straight after the attack, match a DNA profile for Dixie on Interpol's Veritas database. DNA evidence has emerged linking Mark Dixie (left), serving life for the 2005 murder of Sally Anne Bowman, to a rape and two sex assaults in the Costa Del Sol in 2003 that Romano Van der Dussen (right) was jailed for . Yet Spanish authorities refuse to accept the miniscule 54 million-to-one chance that a DNA profile from the sex attack did not match one of Dixie supplied to Interpol by Scotland Yard. They have requested a fresh DNA sample from Dixie so more tests can be carried out - before they release Romano. In April this year a Spanish court sent an international letter of request to the Home office requesting a saliva sample from Dixie to confirm the DNA match as 'a matter of urgency.' In the event of Dixie refusing to supply a profile, the court has asked that the Spanish rape DNA sample is run through the UK National DNA Database to compare with genetic codes held on Dixie. But Romano's lawyers say they have heard nothing since then and Romano is now facing the prospect of another five years in a Spanish jail for a crime he did not commit. Desperate Romano is now urging the British government to intervene and hand over the DNA so his conviction can be quashed. Linda said: 'When the DNA was found on Sally Anne it was sent to Holland, Australia, Spain and all over. 'If the Spanish police and judges had done the same, they would have got him. 'If they had done their work properly, they would have taken proper DNA from the three victims in 2003 and done what we did. It gets me choked thinking about it... even saying that thing's name.' She added: 'I have campaigned so much about DNA and the national database. To me, this is all about the DNA. Dixie was caught nine months after 18-year-old Sally Ann's murder when DNA taken from him after a minor pub scuffle was matched to the crime . 'It can incriminate people but it can also eliminate people. 'We are born with a birth certificate, we have a national insurance number and a passport number - why can't we all have our DNA taken at birth too? 'This would not have happened. My child would still be here. I am so angry.' Dixie was living in Fuengirola, on the Costa Del Sol, when the Spanish victim was raped in August 2003 in startling similar circumstances to Sally's murder in Croydon, South London. Spanish court documents, obtained by MailOnline, describe how in the early hours of the 10 August 2003, two women were robbed and sexually assaulted in the street in Fuengirola, southern Spain. The attacker then carried on his crime spree – targeting a third female victim who was walking along the street in he Costa del Sol town at around 4:30am. He leapt on her, hit her several times before throwing her on the floor and raping her. The case bears chilling similarities to Dixie's rampage on September 25, 2005 - the night stunning blonde model Sally Anne was stabbed to death and raped. After downing drinks and snorting cocaine with friends in Croydon, Dixie is believed to have attacked a female motorist and stolen her mobile phone. He then watched Sally Anne being dropped home by her boyfriend Lewis Sprotson at around 4.10am before stabbing her in the neck and chest and having sex with her as she lay dead on her doorstep. Romano's lawyers say their client is innocent of the Spanish crimes and was mistakenly convicted solely on 'inconsistent' statements from the victims who identified him from photos. He was convicted solely on eyewitness testimony - no DNA or fingerprints linked Romano to the crimes. It is believed Romano may have been the victim of mistaken identity as he bears a striking resemblance to the Dixie – with the same brown curly hair and thick eyebrows. In 2007, his lawyer in Spain discovered that DNA found on the rape victim 'was compatible' with that of Dixie's DNA profile on Interpol database. But despite years of legal wrangling, the Spanish courts said they would not order a retrial or acquit Romano until they receive a saliva sample from Dixie – so that his DNA can be tested more throughly alongside the rape victim's. Sally Anne Bowman on her 18th birthday in Kos with boyfriend Lewis Sprotson . So far Dixie has not given this sample so Romano's last hope is that the Home Office agrees to share Dixie's DNA profile from the UK's national database with the Spanish authorities. Romano's lawyer in Spain Silvio Garcia Sierra, told MailOnline: 'We are waiting for the British authorities to answer to this request, meanwhile Romano is in prison for a crime that all the evidence shows he has not committed. I requested the suspension of the sentence to the Supreme Court, which was not granted because the court did not accept my request. 'The court in Fuengirola, which is leading the case of DNA and other proceedings, is working flawlessly, but we are in the hands of the British authorities, which are in no hurry to forward any DNA testing of Dixie to the Spanish courts.' He added: 'This conviction was based solely on the statements of victims through photographic reconnaissance and recognition in the trial, without any evidence to DNA or fingerprints on the scene. 'Despite the inconsistencies in the statements of victims and witnesses who claimed to have witnessed one of the assaults from a balcony, the court sentenced for these crimes.' Romano, meanwhile, said he has had to endure 'years of torment' while serving his sentence in Palma prison, Majorca. A Dutch charity named the Prison Law Foundation has been campaigning for Romano's release. Dixie was caught nine months after 18-year-old Sally Anne's murder when DNA taken from him after a minor pub scuffle was matched to the crime. He was jailed for life and told he must serve at least 34 years behind bars. The chef was a serial sex offender and detectives have long believed he is responsible for more sex attacks and even murders. At age 16 he was charged with indecent assault after holding a woman a knifepoint and fondling her breasts. Just a year later he was jailed for six months after attacking a mum-of-three. At his murder trial, a Thai woman gave evidence about how Dixie had stabbed and raped her at her home in Subiaco, Western Australia in 1998. Campaign: Linda Bowman wants the DNA of every British citizen to be added to a national database as soon as they're born . The killer's DNA matches that left at the scene of a sexual assault in 2001, where he is believed to have masturbated in front of a woman in a telephone booth. Dixie has also been a prime suspect in one of the notorious unsolved murder cases in Australia - the Claremont killings between 1996 and 1997, as it is believed he was in the area at the time of the killings. The Home Office has so far declined to comment on the case.","Linda Bowman has spoken of her anger over the work of Spanish police .

"Ambulance delays of up to half an hour, well outside the eight minute benchmark, have seen three people dead in Sydney in the past month. The Sydney Morning Herald reports the NSW ambulance service have blamed surges in demand for the increased waiting times, while frustrated paramedics are being forced to wait to off-load patients at Sydney's busy emergency departments. The auditor general also found that 18 ambulances are seen to get 'lost' each day due to hospital delays, a big jump from six in 2005. Brad Jones, 54 (pictured) died waiting 30 minutes for an ambulance at his Blackheath home after choking and suffering a heart attack. His 90 year old mother was forced to administer CPR for half an hour before they arrived . Frustrated paramedics are being forced to wait to off load patients at Sydney's busy emergency departments . Blackheath hospital wardsman, Brad Jones, 54, suffered a heart attack, after choking on a piece of food, at his home last month and his 90 year old mother was forced to administer CPR for more than 30 minutes before paramedics arrived. When they finally got there, they were unable to resuscitate him and he was pronounced dead. There was another incident in Hornsby last month, when it took an ambulance 25 minutes to reach a patient that had trouble breathing, who was taken to hospital but later died. A third man, suffering chest pains, also had to wait half an hour for an ambulance to arrive at his south western Sydney home at Minto Heights, but it was too late and paramedics arrived to the man dead. The NSW ambulance service have blamed surges in demand for the increased waiting times. Three people have died in Sydney in the past month due to waiting at least half an hour for paramedics to arrive . The president of the Australian Paramedics Association, Wayne Flint, said it was the responsibility of the NSW government to take action to 'commit cash and (paramedics)' Health Services Union NSW secretary, Gerard Hayes told the Daily Telegraph there has been constant under-resources of paramedics for a number of years and it has only got worse. 'This is compounded by trolley block, where the lack of resources at emergency wards means crews are forced to wait to hand over patients,' he said. He described the worst hospitals in Sydney as Liverpool, Westmead and the Royal Prince Alfred. Health minister Jillian Skinner has offered her sincere condolences to the families of these patients. 'These incidents are being thoroughly investigated,' she told the Sydney Morning Herald. The president of the Australian Paramedics Association, Wayne Flint, said it was the responsibility of the NSW government to take action to 'commit cash and (paramedics)'. The auditor general also found that 18 ambulances are seen to get 'lost' each day due to hospital delays, a big jump from six in 2005 . It follows heightened concerns last week that an ambulance took way too long to reach felled cricketer Phillip Hughes at the Sydney cricket ground when he collapsed after a bouncer and died days later. The first dispatched NSW ambulance didn't arrive for more than 20 minutes and a second ambulance took almost double the response time expected after called. Medical experts say the delay in care could have been critical to his chances of survival.","Three people have died in Sydney in the past month due to ambulance delays of up to half an hour .

"Former Manchester United star Paul Scholes says Manchester City fans are failing to offer their team the necessary support on big European nights. Scholes, who won the Champions League twice with United, said that atmospheres like Old Trafford and Anfield fire their teams up on European nights. But City's Etihad Stadium doesn't have the same impact, according to the ex-England midfielder. Paul Scholes was critical of Manchester City fans leaving the stadium almost empty at 7.15 on Tuesday . The former Manchester United star said he thought City fans didn't realise how much the competition means . ‘The crowd need to get behind this team they need to create a special European atmosphere,' Scholes told ITV ahead of City's home game with Roma, which was watched by 37,509 fans, nearly 10,000 down on capacity. ‘I was lucky enough to play at Old Trafford and we always talked about the atmosphere on a Tuesday night, the special atmosphere you create, and the crowd is rocking when you go out for a warm up. ‘At quarter past seven and there's empty seats everywhere. Scholes played in the Champions League throughout his United career and enjoyed the 'special' occassions . ‘When you come here it just doesn't have a European night feel to it. You go to Liverpool, you go to Old Trafford, you go to Chelsea, they have a special feeling for it.' Scholes also suggested that the City fans don't appreciate how fortunate they are to be facing Europe's elite clubs. ‘Tonight I don't think there is [a special atmosphere]. I don't think they realise what a big game this is. ‘They've got the team, they've definitely got the players, the quality is definitely there, but do the crowd realise how lucky they are to be in this competition? I don't think they do.’ Another Manchester United legend Rio Ferdiand also hit out at City's fans. The former England captain tweeted:  'How many empty seats are there at the City vs Roma game by the way...big CL game & fans would rather Ramsays Kitchen or something at home'. The QPR defender continued 'Expanding the stadium for what though?? For who though??' Like MailOnline Sport's Facebook page. The fans did get behind their team after City took the lead after three minutes through Sergio Aguero .

"The pesky credit card surcharges that ramp up the cost of purchases on flights, taxis, household bills, tickets and more could be chopped under recommendations to be put forward by Treasurer Joe Hockey this weekend. Consumer campaign group Choice spokesperson Tom Godfrey told Daily Mail Australia it is just a matter of time before surcharges – which are estimated to cost consumers up to $800 million a year - are scrapped. 'We think the end is imminent. The government has signalled they've had enough and now it's time for some strong enforcement against companies,' Mr Godfrey said. Mr Hockey wants the Reserve Bank of Australia to accept recommendations put forward in his Financial Service Inquiry report that call for a stop to hefty surcharges, the Herald Sun reports. Surcharges could be chopped under recommendations put forward by Treasurer Joe Hockey this weekend . Under the recommendations retailers would only be able to charge the administrative cost of paying with card – limited to 12 cents or 0.5 per cent of the transaction value. Currently, companies such as Telstra charge 2 per cents plus GST for card payments and airlines like Jetstar and Tigerair charge a whopping $8.50 per flight. Choice spokesperson Mr Godfrey explained: 'The latest report is a damning blow for excessive surcharges in the industry - airlines, taxis, ticket sellers - anyone that administrates credit card sales on a large scale. 'Australia has had it very bad for a very long time. Choice has been running a long campaign to get rid of these fees... $800 million a year is what it’s costing consumers. A lot of money could be saved if the move is bought in and enforced.’ Under the recommendations retailers would only be able to charge the administrative cost of paying with card . Mr Godfrey said the biggest offenders are the airlines. 'They have been flying high on credit card surcharging for years.' In the meantime, he said consumers can avoid surcharges by looking for a 'fee free payment method' but he acknowledged consumers like the convenience of using their credit cards. Former Commonwealth Bank executive David Murray is leading the Financial Service Inquiry, supported by Mr Hockey. The Treasurer behind this year’s unpopular federal budget told the Herald Sun of the inquiry: ‘A major focus is consumer protection. We need to make sure Australians are as well ­informed as possible so they can make the right choices.’ Airlines like Jetstar and Tigerair add a whopping $8.50 per flight in surcharges . Cabcharge also adds on a percentage in fees for paying with credit card . However, this is not the first attempt to stop credit card charges. In March 2013, Visa became the first company to ban Australian retailers from adding on fees for using their cards. The airlines and the taxi industry did change the way they charged fees as a result. Independent eftpos provider Tyro Payments said more than 36 per cent of Australian businesses, or 100,000 companies, impose some type of surcharge on a customer's bill. This means the majority of companies - 64 per cent or 200,000 – are already doing the right thing for consumers. 36 per cent of Australian businesses impose some type of surcharge on a customer's bill . In June 2012 the Reserve Bank of Australia said it had noticed an ‘increase in cases where surcharges appear to be well in excess of acceptance costs’. ‘The Bank intends that its variation will improve price signals by enabling a card scheme to address cases where merchants are clearly surcharging at a higher level than is justified for acceptance of its card products,’ it added. Daily Mail Australia has contacted the Reserve Bank of Australia for comment on the latest claims. The Financial System Inquiry is aiming to establish a blueprint for the future of Australia's financial system. The inquiry has received more than 6500 submissions since its interim report, 5000 of which touched on the issue of credit card surcharges, AAP reports. Its findings will be released on Sunday, sixteen years since the last financial system inquiry.","Treasurer Joe Hockey will ask the Reserve Bank of Australia to back his plans to scrap credit card surcharges .

"Francois Crepeau, the UN Special Rapporteur for Migrant Rights, said hostile attitudes to migrants in Britain were 'utter bull****' A United Nations official has sparked fury after claiming the public see immigrants as ‘barbarians’ who threaten British culture. Francois Crepeau, the UN Special Rapporteur for Migrants Rights, said hostile attitudes towards migrants in Britain were ‘utter bull****’ - and based on ‘fantasy’ of preserving a 2,000 year-old culture. The Canadian was accused of ‘offensive bigotry’ and political bias over his remarks comments, which also included an attack on Ukip and an apparent endorsement of New Labour’s mass migration policies. And he even appeared to accuse ministers of letting migrants die by not supporting search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean. His comments are only the latest in a string of attacks on the government from United Nations officials on Government policy over welfare reform, human rights and policy towards women in recent years. One Whitehall source said: ‘The UN stands for unelected, unrepresentative and unrealistic when it comes to immigration. 'The government will do what the public expects which is control immigration, not what some unelected bureaucrat says.’ Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘To claim the British public sees immigrants as ‘barbarians’ because it is gripped by a 2,000 year old cultural ‘fantasy’ is offensive bigotry. 'Monsieur Crepeau is aping the very prejudice he is supposed to be fighting.’ Mr Crepeau made the comments in an interview with the i newspaper, in which he was quoted as criticising the attitudes towards immigration in the UK. Scroll down for video . ‘The fantasy is that there is a core British culture that was created probably 2,000 years ago and carried on,’ he said. ‘And now it’s being threatened by all those barbarians that are coming to our gate. This is utter bull****, but who is going to say this?’ He also criticised the Government’s decision not to join in further search and rescue operations. His comments come weeks before a 'fact finding' trip to Italy where 150,000 migrants have been picked from sea by the coastguard in the last year. Above, a group of African migrants rescued near Lampedusa in February . Mr Crepeau said Britain should not stop search and rescue missions for migrants at sea. Ministers withdrew support in October amid fears the journeys were being used by human traffickers as a 'taxi service' Ministers withdrew support in late October amid reports people traffickers were using it as a ‘taxi service’ and encouraging more migrants to attempt the hazardous crossing from North Africa in ramshackle boats. Traffickers were said to be setting off with satellite phones and then calling the Italian coastguard to come and pick them up, it emerged. ‘When politicians are saying, “We should not do search and rescue because it encourages other people to come’, to me this is an extremely cynical way of putting it,” said Mr Crépeau. He added: ‘Not supporting search and rescue operations means letting them die. This is what happens, if you don’t search and rescue them; they die. ‘If we accept that, I think we go well beyond the moral boundaries of our political system.’ He was speaking ahead of a ‘fact-finding’ mission to Italy, where 150,000 migrants were picked up from the sea in the past year . In apparent praise for Tony Blair’s government, he said it was a ‘multicultural, diverse, open society’ which created Cool Britannia in the 1990s. On Ukip he added: ‘If Britannia is ruled by the Ukip, or with Ukip-type policies, it is not going to be cool.’ Ukip leader Nigel Farage told the Telegraph: ‘More people came to Britain in 2013 than came between 1066 and 1950. 'That gives you a sense of perspective of where we are with this, so he is talking utter baloney. ‘He is just not living in the real world. Britain is one of the most relaxed countries in the whole of Europe on immigration, but not with numbers like this.’ In September last year Brazilian Raquel Rolnik, the Special Rapporteur on housing, produced what was condemned as a ‘misleading Marxist diatribe’ about government housing and welfare reforms. It later emerged that she dabbled in witchcraft and had previously offered an animal sacrifice to Karl Marx. Ukip leader Nigel Farage dismissed the man's comments as 'utter baloney'. Last year Brazilian Raquel Rolnik, UN Special Rapporteur on housing, was accused of producing 'misleading Marxist diatribe' Earlier, South African Rashida Manjoo said sexism in Britain was worse than in anywhere else in the world . Then in April, Rashida Manjoo, a South African feminist academic, said sexism in Britain was worse than anywhere else in the world.

"This is the incredible moment a sperm whale who is just minutes old is escorted to the surface for its first breath by female whales who act as midwives. The amazing images show the pregnant mother swimming along with a pod of the normally shy animals in the Azores. Suddenly the mother-to-be stops and gives birth to a young whale surrounded by the pod. After giving birth, the mother and her baby are immediately surrounded by a pod of other female whales to help care for the new born . The young whale is then held by the mother and another sperm whale just moments after its birth . The other whales then appear to act as midwives and escort the newborn to the surface so it can take its first breath . But with the baby needing to get to the surface for air, several female whales quickly descend and usher it upwards while the weak mother watches on. The remarkable footage was captured on camera by wildlife photographer Kurt Amsler, who sought special authorisation from the government of the Azores to film with the protected creatures. Mr Amsler explained: 'Newborn whales are not able to swim within the first minutes and would drown without assistance. 'That's why there are always other females in attendance as midwives. By this time, the mother has arrived to support her newborn, which is easily 2.80 metres in length. The baby sperm whale swims next to its mother. The incredible images were captured by wildlife photographer Kurt Amsler . The birth of the baby whale, pictured, occurred just seconds after Mr Amsler jumped into the water while diving in the Azores . 'With every passing minute the baby is increasingly mobile and able to swim independently over short distances. I can also hear his communication, which has a higher pitch than the others - the voice of a child.' To capture the rarely ever seen event, Kurt, from Bandol, France, sought special authorisation from the Azores government to film with the gentle and protected creatures. Mr Amsler from Bandol in France, spent nine hours in a small boat being guided by 'spotters' positioned in towers along the Azores coast, who were able to see the 'blow' of the whales, and radio in their position. The birth of the whale occurred just seconds after he jumped into the water. He added: 'For the first 60 metres, I go as fast as possible, scanning the blue waters to catch a glimpse of the animals. 'However, there is nothing but a big murky cloud. I then realise it is blood, which appears greenish under water by the loss of red spectrum. The female whales take over and help escort the baby whale to the surface as the weak mother, pictured, watches on . 'At first I thought this could explain the pod's strange behaviour - a wounded animal watched over by the others. 'As the whales' communication sounds intensify, I can see the group about 18 metres in front of me, just below the surface and huddled together. With the sun directly in front of me, it is very difficult to see exactly what is going on. 'I then descend to 15 meters and carefully pass beneath the whales. And now they are clearly distinguished from the background and I realise what is happening - this is not a wounded animal but a mother giving birth. Mr Amsler, who has been taking pictures underwater for 45 years says witnessing the birth was one of the most powerful things he had ever seen . 'Parts of skin and the placenta are floating around and I can see the baby, which had left the womb just few seconds earlier. 'It is still immobile and supported by five midwifes to the surface for its first breath. The mother, still weak, is watching it from below. 'In my 45 years of underwater photography, I have documented many spectacular and unique situations. However, this experience was the most powerful of all. 'More important for me is the fact that these unique images will spread awareness and encourage people to support the protection of these intelligent and endangered marine mammals in any way they can.'","A female sperm whale gives birth surrounded by a pod of other females .

"James Bond is known for blowing up, crashing or otherwise destroying the cars Q branch spend years carefully engineering for him. But 007 will have to take care of his new Aston Martin - as the British sportscar brand has only built 10 of a new model designed exclusively for his latest film,Spectre. The car, called the DB10, was unveiled this morning at the launch party of the movie, which will be Daniel Craig's fourth as the legendary spy. The manufacturer is being as tight-lipped as MI5 about the specifications of the car, which will not go on sale and will only be driven by Bond. They say the vehicle is a 'nod to future designs' and they are keeping the machine as far away as possible from rival firms who they fear may try to copy its sleek design. Film producers and crew have also yet to reveal what gadgets the car will have, following the famous ejector seats, rocket launchers and even built-in defibrillators of previous models. Scroll down for videos . Aston Martin have created 10 custom-built DB10s for the new Bond film, Spectre,  it was announced today. The car will not be mass produced . Only 10 of the cars have been built especially for the film and developers are keeping details secret for fear other companies will copy it. Producers are even keeping tight-lipped about what gadgets - the trademark of Bond cars - the vehicle will have . The car was developed by Aston Martin and Sam Mendes, the director of the latest Bond film, who unveiled the machine this morning . The car was made at Aston Martin's Gaydon headquarters and celebrates 50 years since James Bond first drove an Aston Martin in Goldfinger . Aston Martin say they worked closely with Bond director Sam Mendes to create 'the ultimate car for the world's most famous spy'. It is the 50th anniversary of Bond's use of an Aston Martin, which started in the film Goldfinger when Sean Connery drove the iconic DB5. The firm's CEO Dr Andy Palmer said: 'In the same year that we celebrate our 50-year relationship with 007, it seems doubly fitting that today we unveiled this wonderful new sports car created especially for James Bond. 'It is great news for this company and for everyone around the world that loves to see Bond at the wheel of an Aston Martin. I'm incredibly proud of everyone in the team at Gaydon who have brought this special project from concept to reality.' Bond drove Aston Martins in the 1960s, with Connery the first to get behind the wheel of one of the sportscars, followed by George Lazenby, who used a DBS in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, in which the car featured in the famous final scene where Bond's newly-married wife, the Countess Tracy di Vicenzo played by Diana Rigg, is shot through the windscreen. Aston Martins were then reprised in the late 1980s, when Timothy Dalton drove a V8 Vantage Volante in the film, The Living Daylights. The car was shown off at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, west of London today at the launch of the new film, due out next year . Daniel Craig - who has driven Aston Martins in each of his three previous films - will drive the car in the latest movie, directed by Sam Mendes . Craig (centre) will be joined by (left to right) Naomie Harris, Lea Seydoux,  Monica Bellucci and Christoph Waltz in the new blockbuster . The car was produced to celebrate 50 years since Bond first drove an Aston Martin, the classic DB5 used by Sean Connery in Goldfinger . The classic DB5 then briefly featured in scenes in the 1990s films GoldenEye and Tomorrow Never Dies before, in 2002, Piers Brosnan drove a V12 Vanquish which featured a high-tech 'cloaking device' which made the vehicle virtually invisible in Die Another Day. Daniel Craig has driven Aston Martins in his three previous outings as Bond; a DB5 and a DBS V12 in Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace and a DB5 in Skyfall. Spectre, which is due for general release on 6 November 2015, will feature Oscar-winning star Christoph Waltz, Moriarty actor Andrew Scott, Italian star Monica Bellucci and French actress Lea Seydoux alongside Craig. The film is named after the shadowy terrorist organisation created by Bond author Ian Fleming which first appeared in his novel Thunderball. Locations for the new film will include London, Mexico City, Rome, Morocco's Tangier and Erfoud, as well as Solden in Austria, which promises to see Bond returning to the ski slopes. 'All of them are amazing places. I'm very excited to be going to these locations over seven months, which is how long we'll be shooting,' said Mendes. Announcing the production today, film-makers said of the plot: 'A cryptic message from Bond's past sends him on a trail to uncover a sinister organisation. While M battles political forces to keep the secret service alive, Bond peels back the layers of deceit to reveal the terrible truth behind Spectre.' Aston Martin is not the only brand to appear in the new film; Bollinger, Heineken, Jaguar Land Rover, Omega, Sony Electronics, and Sony Mobile will also feature. Bond took to driving other sportscars in the 1970s and 1980s. Piers Brosnan, pictured with a Vanquish ahead of the film Die Another Day, reprised them in the 1990s . The car used in Die Another Day was packed with Bond's trademark gadgets,  including a 'cloaking device' which made it invisible . Daniel Craig has driven Aston Martins in each of his three previous outings as Bond, including this V12 Coupe in Quantum of Solace . A gadget in the car even saved the character's life in Casino Royale when he used a defibrillator fitted to the dashboard after being poisoned .","Aston Martin is celebrating 50 years since James Bond first drove one of their cars in the 1960s film Goldfinger .

"George Osborne today rolled up his sleeves to prepare afternoon tea for the finance ministers from some of the world's leading economies. The Chancellor joined members of the Women's Institute to butter scones for G& politicians and central bankers. Hosting a two-day summit at a country house in Buckinghamshire, Mr Osborne issue a blunt warning that global economic recovery is not guaranteed. Chancellor George Osborne joined Women's Institute members in the kitchen of Hartwell Hall to prepare afternoon tea for G7 finance ministers . The Chancellor said he wanted to give the ministers and central bank governors a 'proper English tea' Mr Osborne said more needs to be done to . ‘nurture’ an international revival. He . said progress was being made in securing growth, but cautioned: ‘The . challenge is not to falter in the difficult steps we need to take to . make that recovery sustainable and lasting.’ Britain this year holds the chairmanship of the G7, which also includes France, the USA, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan. Banking reforms will top the agenda for the two-day meeting at the grand Hartwell House in Buckinghamshire. Ahead . of the talks Mr Osborne said: ‘Our meeting takes place at a time of . greater economic stability, thanks to policy action taken. Markets have . calmed, and there are signs that this is feeding through into greater . confidence. ‘But we cannot . take the global recovery for granted. We must guard against weakening . our resolve to confront the collective challenges we face.’ Mr Osborne has been boosted by better than expected predictions of growth in the UK.

Economic and Social Research said output rose by 0.8 per cent between . February and April – the most since the Olympics.

Chancellor George Osborne, who was out running early this morning, is hosting a meeting of G7 finance ministers to plot a global economic recovery . Mr Osborne warned against weakening resolve to secure growth, saying economic recovery should not be taken for granted . Mr Osborne said the leading economies had to focus on ‘the three pillars of monetary activism, fiscal responsibility, and structural reform’. He plans to use the UK's chairmanship to make the meeting less formal in a bid to increase flexibility at the talks, which will initially focus on the global economy. Mr Osborne wants to see worldwide agreements to end the idea of some banks being ‘too big to fail’, while also tackling tax evasion and avoidance. The G7 meeting is being hosted at Hartwell House in Buckinghamshire . Hundreds of ultra-wealthy Britons are being investigated for tax evasion following the exposure of their secret offshore accounts, it emerged yesterday. International spy agencies are thought to have helped obtain a 'goldmine' of data that names high-profile multi-millionaires and their financial advisers. The files show how the rich have hidden billions in Singapore, the British Virgin Islands and the Caymans. More than 100 individuals have been identified so far – and have already been sent warning letters by HM Revenue & Customs. Mr Osborne said of the data: 'The message is simple: if you evade tax we're coming after you. This data is another weapon in HMRC's arsenal.' The Chancellor has previously expressed shock at the extent to which the wealthy were exploiting tax loopholes. Ahead of the G7 meeting, Mr Osborne said: ‘Our task is to nurture the recovery. Our challenge is not to falter in the difficult steps we need to take to make that recovery sustainable and lasting.’ He added: ‘Countries can do much together to improve our economies. We are not powerless victims of global forces - but can be masters of our own destiny. ‘We have shown political will to tackle problems at home - and I believe the UK is further along that road than many. Now we can together show the political will to nurture global economic recovery. ‘We have more in common than separates us. The G7 can be a catalyst for collective action to the benefit of all.’ Mr Osborne acknowledged that debt and deficit levels ‘are too high’ in the UK, as well as other G7 economies and called for fresh resolve to tackle the problem.","Chancellor hosts summit of leading economies in Buckinghamshire .

"Avid Grant Theft Auto gamers have been left livid after Target and Kmart made the decision to pull the R-rated game from their shelves. Target decided to scrap sales of the popular game after an online petition slammed it for encouraging players to 'commit sexual violence and kill women'. The petition, authored by former sex workers, has so far attracted almost 40,000 signatures. It says the 'sickening game' encourages players to kill prostitutes and calls on Target to stop selling it. Scroll down for video . 26-year-old gamer Kiley McDonald diputes claims the game incites violence towards women . An online petition slammed R-rated video game Grand Theft Auto V (GTA5) for encouraging players to 'commit sexual violence and kill women' 'Games like this are grooming yet another generation of boys to tolerate violence against women,' the petition said. General manager of corporate affairs Jim Cooper said Target would no longer sell the game. 'We've been speaking to many customers over recent days about the game, and there is a significant level of concern about the game's content,' he said in a statement on Wednesday. 'We've also had customer feedback in support of us selling the game, and we respect their perspective on the issue. Kiley is an avid fan of the game and even has her own GTA character called 'SHADOWKiiLLA' 'However, we feel the decision to stop selling GTA5 is in line with the majority view of our customers.' Manager of Facebook site Grand Theft Auto Tips & Tricks Kiley McDonald says the move is 'ridiculous' and disputes claims that the game incites violence towards women. 'I remember playing it as a 10-year-old, my parents got it for me,' She told Daily Mail Australia. 'It never offended me, it doesn't offend me now and I grew up alight. 'I don't go out and mow down people or pull a gun out and spray them or anything, so I just think it's a little bit over the top.' McDonald claims that there is a significant amount of violence towards men throughout the game and believes women  are in short supply. She said she was 'speechless' as to why GTA had been specifically targeted and believes that parents who won't let their kids play the game, would probably be happy to give them permission to sit through an episode of Game of Thrones, or read a chapter from 50 Shades of Grey. 'If I don't like someone's clothing, I'm not going to ask the store to ban a certain type of shorts,' she said. 'If I don't like it, I don't look at it,because I've got better things to do.' McDonald believes the campaigners against the game are 'misinformed' and 'threw a tantrum' when they didn't get what they wanted. 'I'm all for feminists and women's rights but this is going a bit too far.' she said. 26-year-old McDonald believes big retailers such as Kmart and Target should not have to suffer financially due to this unjust petition. 'I don't know why gamers should be punished for something that's not our fault, or the retailers fault because they've gone through all the standards and checked the game,' she said. The petition, authored by former sex workers, has so far attracted almost 40,000 signatures. It says the 'sickening game' encourages players to kill prostitutes and calls on Target to stop selling it . McDonald said she understand the anger from former sex workers who launched the online petition, but believes GTA gamers do not play out these acts in the real world. 'It's up to the gamer to choose,' she said. 'I've played the story from start to finish, I'm 26-years-old, I'm a female and I was not once offended, I was not once appalled by the content,' she said. 'There are prostitutes in the game, there is a strip club in the game but very few of them that you see.' Reports that the game depicts women as bimbos and prey for men has angered McDonald. 'Most of them are actually dressed quite normally.' she said. 'Games like this are grooming yet another generation of boys to tolerate violence against women,' the petition said . 'These people actually look like they're going to work, they've got the content that perfect that some people are in uniform or they're in work clothes or summer gear.' McDonald said little children are the worst offenders in online forums. 'They're the ones that taunt you on the microphone, saying 'I'm going to f**k you mum' and 'F you this', and 'F that', it's insane and they shouldn't be playing it' she said. 'Most people have grown up playing video games like that and we're fine,' 'We don't go shooting up people and punching cops' McDonald said there are other children's games available that are much more dangerous. 'There's also another game which a lot of children play called World of Warcraft and  a lot of sexual predators are on that game.' she said. General manager of corporate affairs Jim Cooper said Target would no longer sell Grand Theft Auto V . The young gamer worries that this ban will effect future sales of Grand Theft Auto as there will be a monopoly on who will be able to sell the game. Ultimately, she said it's really going to effect gamers who are keen on playing the game. 'My worry is that it's  going to be banned so it's going to be a problem for future games,' she said. Mr Cooper said Target would continue to sell other R-rated DVDs and games. 'While these products often contain imagery that some customers find offensive, in the vast majority of cases, we believe they are appropriate products for us to sell to adult customers,' he said. 'However, in the case of GTA5, we have listened to the strong feedback from customers that this is not a product they want us to sell.' GTA5 is an award-winning game which set a sales record for entertainment products, passing the $1 billion sales mark after three days.","General manager of corporate affairs Jim Cooper said Target would no longer sell Grand Theft Auto V .

"Motorists paid out a record £1.4 billion in parking charges to councils in England and were hit by almost £1 million per day in parking fines. In total car owners forked out £160,000 every hour to town halls  for parking permits, fines, pay-and-display tickets, and other parking charges. The haul includes a staggering £343million in parking tickets. The new figures show that local authorities made a record profit last year of £546million from parking. Motorists paid out £1 million per day in parking fines, Government figures revealed . The figures from Government do not include what  motorists also paid to park in privately run car parks, so the real impact on drivers would be even higher. Eric Pickles, the Government's Communities Secretary warned councils not to treat motorists as 'cash cows', but it would appear the plea has been ignored by town halls. Last year's total parking income haul of £1.409billion was a rise of 1.5percent on the £1.389billion that English councils brought in during the previous 12 months. However, parking fines were down to £343million from £353 million the previous year. An AA spokesman said: 'Looking at these figures it seems clear that the local authority parking gravy train is still running full steam with parking profits up on last year. 'Local authorities continue to squeeze every penny they can from drivers when it comes to parking charges. The total parking haul of £1.4billion was a rise of 1.5 per cent on the amount brought in during the previous 12 months . 'This is despite the fact that town centres are battling with one another and on-line shopping to attract trade especially at this time of year. 'Far from easing off on charges many authorities now charge well into the evening and on Sundays deterring many with money in their pocket from visiting some town centres. 'Hopefully some councils may shed their Scrooge like image this Christmas by giving drivers a break with some free parking to bump up local trade - but make no mistake it may be short-term with civil enforcement officers back on the street to enjoy a post Christmas sale parking ticket bonanza!' Of the 20 local authorities that made the most income from parking a total of 13 of them come from London. Westminster Council hauled in a total of almost £81million last year, way ahead of its nearest rival. Outside the capital the places that hit the motorist the hardest are Brighton and Hove, Nottingham Birmingham, Manchester and Cornwall. London councils that collect the most money from parking: . 1. Westminster (£80.6m) 2. Kensington & Chelsea (£47.1m) 3. Camden (£38.8) 4. Hammersmith & Fulham (£34.7m) 5. Wandsworth (£29.6m) 6. Islington (£25.7m) 7. Lambeth (£24.7m) 8. Ealing (£18.9m) 9. Hackney (£18.6m) 10. Haringey (£16.3m) Outside the capital the councils that raised the most from parking: . 1. Brighton and Hove (£25.8m) 2. Nottingham City (£18.9m) 3. Birmingham (£18.3m) 4. Manchester (£14.8m) 5. Cornwall (£14.3m) 6. Newcastle (£14.3m) 7. Bristol (£13.3m) 8. Leeds (£12.6m) 9. Milton Keynes (£11.4m) 10. Guildford (£11.1m) John O'Connell, Director of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'Drivers are already hit hard by everything from fuel duty to road tax, and profiteering Councils taking them for a ride with too-high parking charges will rub salt in the wound. 'Councils should use parking charges purely as a way of funding the maintenance and upkeep of car parks and streets. Local authorities can't use hard-pressed motorists who rely on their cars as a way to fill the coffers, but must instead focus on eliminating waste in other areas.' Cllr Peter Box, Transport Spokesman at the Local Government Association, said: 'These figures prove that councils remain on the side of hard-pressed motorists with parking fines going down and total parking income staying below the rate of inflation over the past 12 months. 'The reality is that the average motorist is paying 30 times more to Whitehall in charges and taxation each year than they do to their town hall through parking. 'Parking charges and fines are essential to help councils keep traffic flowing and pedestrians and motorists safe. On-street parking revenue is spent on paying for parking services. Any surplus is spent on essential transport projects, such as talking the £12 billion roads repair backlog and providing subsidised travel to elderly and disabled residents.'","Motorists paid a record £1.4 billion in parking charges to local councils .

"A mother whose premature twins died while she lay in a coma following a tragic ambulance mix-up has led the tributes among mourners at her daughters' funeral. Jocelyn Bennett, 27, attended the service for her children Melody and Rose Clarke at Lodge Hill Crematorium in Birmingham yesterday in a wheelchair. She was allowed out of hospital especially for the service, which comes after she spent 18 days in a coma only to be told upon regaining consciousness that her daughters had passed away. Scroll down for video . Jocelyn Bennett, 27, attended the service for her children Melody and Rose Clarke at Lodge Hill Crematorium in Birmingham in a wheelchair. She was supported by friends and family at the service for her twin daughters . The white horse-drawn princess carriage carried the coffins to the service at Lodge Hill Crematorium . Pink bunting was draped over the coffins of the twin daughters, with their names Melody and Rose on . The twin girls, Melody and Rose Clarke (pictured above in images released by the family), died from multi-organ failure on November 4 . Wearing her favourite colour red, she was wheeled behind the twins' tiny coffins as they were carried to the crematorium in a white horse-drawn princess carriage. White teddy bears were placed inside the carriage along with matching floral tributes. A card showing a picture of Ms Bennett and her partner Kevin, 31, cradling their tragic twins simply read: 'God Bless you Melody and Rose.' Reverend Denise Jones, who led the service, paid tribute to Melody and Rose saying they were two 'very very special baby girls'. She told the 50-strong congregation: 'They were much loved and wanted twin girls and baby sisters to little Slater. 'The last few weeks have been a journey of great courage, determination and faith. The loss of our children is the most painful thing to ever have to experience in our lives. 'Melody and Rose touched the hearts of all of us here today as well as the community and world and they have left behind a beautiful legacy of love.' Hymns 'All Things Bright and Beautiful' and 'Lord of the Dance' were sang by the congregation who all dressed in bright colours on the request of Ms Bennett. Mourners were played 'Somewhere over the rainbow' at the end of the 40-minute ceremony. The babies were delivered by emergency caesarean while Ms Bennett fought for life after collapsing at her home in Druids Heath, Birmingham. She was 32 weeks pregnant when she called 999 early in the morning of October 29 after suffering suffered a placental abruption. When paramedics arrived 12 minutes later at 5.51am, she was in such pain that she could not press the door buzzer to let them in.

Funeral of Melody and Rose at Lodge Hill Crematorium, Birmingham. Tragically, her neighbours refused to buzz the ambulance crew into the council-run tower block because they thought the blue flashing lights were from police vans about to raid the flats. When police finally arrived to let the paramedics in, they found Ms Bennett lying unconscious on the floor of flat - 30 minutes after her initial 999 call. She was rushed to hospital where 4lb 1oz Melody and 3lb Rose were born by emergency caesarean. Tragically, while Ms Bennett slipped into a coma, her baby daughters suffered multi-organ failure and their life support was switched off. They passed away on November 4. The devastated father of Ms Bennett, Joe, 54, said yesterday: 'This has been a tragic time for Jocelyn and everybody in the family. 'We are grateful for all the support and glad Jocelyn was able to attend the service. 'There are still questions which need answering as to why the paramedics were unable to get to Jocelyn sooner but today is about saying goodbye to Rose and Melody.' Following their deaths, Mr Bennett wrote a poem for each of the girls. He previously told how neighbours in the block of flats refused to answer their buzzers to police following a recent raid. 'If any residents see flashing blue lights they don't answer their calls because they fear it'll be another raid. 'No one answered their buzzers when the paramedics tried them. 'There are vulnerable people living in that building and the council has a duty of care for them. A better system needs to be in place.' Birmingham City Council is investigating why paramedics were unable to gain access to Ms Bennett's home in Pleck House. A spokesman for Birmingham City Council said: 'We have systems to provide emergency access to our blocks for the emergency services and an urgent investigation was commissioned as soon as we were made aware of the matter.' Tributes placed with the coffins from relatives of Ms Bennett offered condolences and love to the family . Rose and Melody were born prematurely and died aged just a few days old due to severe organ failure . The twins' tiny coffins arrived by a horse-drawn princess carriage before floral tributes were placed outside . Prior to their deaths, the Bennett family held a 'Christmas' party for the twin girls and had them christened. Ms Bennett's father, his wife Lorraine, and the girls' father Mr Clarke held a small party in hospital for the twins. Mr Bennett said they documented the party, in which they dressed up in Christmas hats and jumpers, so that they could show Ms Bennett photographs when she awoke from her coma. She came round on November 16. At the time of the party, Mr Bennett said: 'It was all for Joyce for when she comes round. We can show her the children were loved and that they brought love into our lives. 'I don't want her to see sad pictures. They were baptised on the day they were born as we knew that was what Joyce had wanted.' After the party, Mr Bennett and his wife dressed the babies in the clothes their mother had chosen to take them home in. On the day they passed away, the hospital chaplain performed a touching service before the babies were placed in their father's arms for one last cuddle. Mr Bennett and his family held the babies and celebrated an early Christmas with them before their deaths .

"Earlier this summer, ride-sharing company Uber claimed that a driver in New York makes an average of $90,000 a year. Now they have revealed what it takes it reach the salary - working more than 80 hours a week while making an average of $22.50 an hour. According to a blog post on their site it is based on drivers being online for 50 weeks of the year, working the same number of hours and using uberX, the cheapest option available to customers. The chart shows Uber drivers can earn up to $90,000 a year if they work for 80 hours a week and make an average of $21 an hour . The statistics compiled by the company revealed that drivers made roughly the same amount of money per hour no matter how many they worked in a week. This allows drivers to use their own non-luxury vehicles to transport passengers. The numbers however do not take into account expenses such as gas and insurance - which the partners have to cover themselves. However they insisted that drivers are guaranteed to take home $5,000 for 200 hours in a month, no matter what time of day they chose to work. A spokesman told the Huffington Post that if the drivers were to work for 40 hours a week - they would earn around $50,000 (or $25.17 an hour) - which according to the US Department for Labor is almost double that of an average taxi driver. The post read: 'We’re so confident in the idea that every hour worked with Uber is a good one that we guarantee it - every partner working with Uber in New York is guaranteed $5,000 take home pay for 200 hours of work in a month, regardless of which 200 hours they choose. 'The data illustrates that a substantial number of partners are using the Uber platform to power better economic opportunities. 'This is a significant change from the status quo and the thousands of drivers on the platform are a testament to that opportunity. The company also added that drivers made virtually same amount per hour no matter how many they worked in a week. 'That predictability is a virtue,' the post continued. 'It allows drivers to work when it’s convenient for them, earning money in between other jobs, work with other companies, or personal time away from work.' Uber said that their drivers are guaranteed to take home $5,000 a month if they work for 200 hours . It also means that part time Uber drivers can make more per hour than their full-time counterparts. Many partners choose just to work during 'surge-pricing' hours - where fares are hiked to get more cars onto the road. This means fares can as much as double until a higher number of vehicles are back on the road. The base rate for an Uber cab in New York is $3. Then it is an additional $2.15 for for every mile as well as an extra 40 cents per minute. In September they revealed that Uber drivers were making more money than ever before, even though fares had gone down, while partners spent almost half their time with a passenger when they were working. The company also reported today that it has raised a fresh $1.2 billion in funding, giving the popular ride-sharing startup a reported value of some $40 billion. Last month they were forced to apologize after suggesting a plan to spend $1million on a team of researchers to dig up dirt on journalists who criticize his company.

"Hundreds of thousands of mussels have washed ashore on a beach, prompting officials to warn people not to eat them. A stretch of Robberg Beach, on the southern coast of South Africa, has been transformed into 'mussel beach' as thousands of the black molluscs cover the sands. As experts try to to work out what caused the mussels to be washed up, people were warned to play it safe and not eat them. Scroll down for video . Thousands of mussels have washed ashore on Robberg Beach in South Africa, with officials warning people not to eat them . Some fear that a toxic bloom of algae may have contributed to the mussels being washed ashore, but experts have denied this . Some believe that toxic 'red tide', a harmful bloom of algae, may have played a role in the mussels being washed up along the 325-yard section of the beach, but this has been dismissed by experts. Conservationist Dr Mark Brown, from Nature's Valley Trust, told the Port Elizabeth Herald: 'It does not appear to be linked to red tide or anything sinister at this stage. 'A similar event happened in November last year in the same spot. 'Essentially large swells and currents break beds of mussels off the reef and they wash up.' Officials believe strong currents may have washed the mussels off a reef further out at sea . Thousands of the mussels washed up on Robberg Beach, covering a 325-yard section of the bay . While people have been warned not to eat the mussels, flocks of seagulls have been seen enjoying the delicacy . South African National Parks marine ecologist Kyle Smith warned the public to resist eating the delicacy. 'Most of the mussels were still alive when they washed up, which lowers the possibility that it is related to some form of toxin from either a red algal bloom or other source. 'As a precautionary measure, I would advise the public not to eat them.'

"Mystery surrounds the whereabouts of the world-famous 007 spy dolphins seized from Ukraine by Russia amid speculation they could be deployed against the West. Naval sources in Crimea said the creatures had begun their first military exercises under commander-in-chief Vladimir Putin, a claim quickly denied by his Defence Ministry. In a day of Cold War-style intrigue and subterfuge, Russian officials then cast doubt on the existence of a dolphin naval squad - three months after heralding their 'defection' from Ukraine following Moscow's annexation of Crimea. A Russian military dolphin is photographed carrying an underwater bomb. The specially trained animals came under Moscow's control when Russian siezed Crimea from Ukraine in March . Naval sources in Crimea said the creatures had begun their first military exercises under commander-in-chief Vladimir Putin, a claim quickly denied by his Defence Ministry . Some news sources quickly insisted the Russian Black Sea fleet was not involved in any military use of dolphins, leading to uncertainty over their whereabouts and role . Confusion about the dolphins surfaced after a report by a state owned news agency Sputnik claimed Russia's Black Sea Fleet Special Forces had initiated its first exercises with the combat dolphins since they were taken from Ukraine. A military source said: 'Training exercises were held in the Sevastopol Oceanarium in the search of military equipment at a depth of over 60 metres. An object that looked like a mine was spotted by a dolphin and tagged with a buoy. 'We had to practically start from scratch to teach the [mammals] to search for objects under the water because the Ukrainian Navy hardly worked with them.' But other news sources quickly insisted the Russian Black Sea fleet was not involved in any military use of dolphins, leading to uncertainty over their whereabouts and role. In March, Russian media reported that the dolphins had 'defected' to Moscow - along with many Ukrainian forces in Crimea - but now Russia has cast doubt on whether the squad even exists . Swimming: It's thought that Moscow has taken charge of 13 elite units of dolphins, and a number of military sea lions . Major General Igor Konashenkov, the Defence Ministry's official spokesman, said: 'There have been, and there are, no training exercises with dolphins. 'The bases of the Black Sea Fleet are safely protected by special technical means of anti-sabotage forces, that's why there is no need in using exotic ways of safeguarding adjacent waters.' The office of the commander of the Russian Navy said dolphins had been used during the Soviet era, but this work had stopped and the animals had been sold off. A source said: 'All services that were involved in the military training of dolphins in the Black Sea fleet under the Soviets were abolished after the collapse of the Soviet Union, almost quarter a century ago. 'No decisions on their restoration was made after Crimea's unification to Russia. 'Everyone who has been to a dolphinarium at least once knows that dolphins and seals can be trained to do anything. The question is if the military need that.' One observer said: 'Perhaps the dolphins are KGB not military agents. Maybe they are now on a special mission which is why they deny their existence.' Highly trained: The combat dolphins are prepared for military duties at the Crimean State Oceanarium, which was inherited by Ukraine when the Soviet Union collapsed 23 years ago . Display: The military dolphins are trained to hunt for mines, plant bombs on hostile ships or attack enemy divers with special knives or pistols fixed to their heads. Pictured is a fully kitted-out model of a military dolphin . The Russian military dolphin training programme dates back to Cold War era of the 1970s when the Soviet Union utilised the animals in Sevastopol to search for mines or spy on foreign ships. After the fall of the USSR, they were passed to the Ukrainian Navy but when Russia annexed Crimea in March, the animals were reported to have returned to the control of Moscow. In September Acting Sevastopol governor Sergei Menyailo said: 'The jurisdiction over this facility has been fully transferred to the Russian Defence Ministry.' The unit included 13 elite dolphins as well as a number of sea lions, it was claimed. The creatures are trained to hunt for mines, plant bombs on hostile ships or attack enemy divers with special knives or pistols fixed to their heads. Others were schooled for anti-sabotage and rescue missions. NATO is now running constant patrols in the Black Sea due to the Ukrainian crisis, leading to speculation Russia could deploy them against Western ships. Shortly after the annexe of Crimea, Moscow acknowledged that the bottlenose dolphins had 'defected' to Russia along with many Ukrainian forces. The Sevastopol facility is said to be one of only two such combat dolphin training centres in the world. The other is run by the US Navy in San Diego, which also pioneered their use for military purposes.

While four per cent of parents have to think up recipes to incorporate different tastes or fussy children. Washing up after Christmas dinner is hated by nearly a quarter of those surveyed in the poll . Preparing food over the period - 48% . Not making a plan to make dinner - 39% . Undertaking the big food shop - 32% . Cleaning up after dinner - 24% . Making lumpy gravy - 19% . Burning/overcooking Christmas dinner - 18% . Not defrosting the turkey/meat on time - 13% . Getting food timings muddled up - 9% . Forgetting a particular ingredient and not knowing what the best substitute is - 8% . Thinking about what to do with leftovers and how to minimise wastage - 8% . Having to cater for unexpected guests - 7% . Recipes to incorporate different tastes  - 4% . One in 10 (eight per cent)  worry about what to do with leftovers or having to cater for an unexpected guest (seven per cent). The poll was carried out by Flora, whose Technical Chef, said: 'We know undertaking the big food shop is stressful and the common mishap of forgetting a particular ingredient and not knowing the substitute is a pain. 'A great way to help lighten the load when it comes to family cooking is by planning your menu and recipes in advance. 'Family foodies worrying about their feast-mas are not alone; we found one in two (48 per cent) find buying and preparing food, and catering over the Christmas period stressful; while a quarter (24 per cent) dread the clean up after dinner.' The 12 pains of Christmas released by Flora reveal more of the unlucky mishaps that add to the festive traditions, such as forgetting to buy batteries for new toys (36 per cent), not having a gift for someone who has unexpectedly bought you one (35 per cent) and missing the date for the Christmas post (33 per cent).","Study by Flora reveals one in ten home cooks get timings muddled up .

"Firing improvised explosives with a range of around a mile, this is the homemade weapon of choice of the Free Syrian Army known as the 'hell cannon'. The cannon has been widely used during the conflict in besieged cities such as Aleppo and usually fires out highly modified propane gas cylinders. The improvised launcher is often used by the rebels as they only have access to small arms such as machine guns and have to make their own weapons and ammunition. Scroll down for video . A shell is fired from the homemade weapon known as a 'hell cannon' by rebels from the Free Syrian Army in the ruins of the city of Aleppo . Before firing the cannon, the rebels wheeled the launcher into the street so they could put it in place before firing it . A rebel fighter uses a compass to determine the direction of the fire in Aleppo as they fight against forces of President Bashar al-Assad . But the rebel group are said to take great pride in the cannon, with resistance fighters watching online videos and given a fact sheet on how to fire it. The conflict in Syria began in 2011 in an uprising against President Bashar al-Assad, which gradually descended into civil war after a fierce crackdown. Now the country also face the threat from the Islamic State, who are occupying several cities in Syria including Raqqa. The rebels prepare their homemade shells ready to be fired from the hell cannon. Some of the rebels watch online videos about the weapon and are given a fact sheet on how to fire ammunition from the cannon . A fighter makes a homemade shell which will be fired from the cannon. The rebels have been fighting government forces since 2011 following an uprising against President Bashar al-Assad . Yesterday, pictures emerged of an ISIS terrorist in the Syrian border town of Kobane firing a 10-foot long sniper rifle out of a flat window. The fearsome weapon fires 23mm calibre bullets, far larger than the standard size. The picture emerged after a show of force from al Qaeda's Nusra Front, a rival group. They toured in a convoy around villages they said they had captured from Syrian rebels. The cannon usually fires out propane gas cylinders, that have been highly modified, with the weapon having a range of about one mile . The rebel group are said to take great pride in the cannon as they usually only have access to small weapons such as light machine guns . A rebel walks among the ruins of the city of Aleppo. In a new interview President Assad said winning the war against the rebels would be long and hard . The U.S. have led airstrikes against ISIS fighters since September in a bid to harm the terror group's fighting capabilities. But in a new interview published in a French magazine on Thursday, President Assad said his troops have noticed no difference since the strikes began and also dismissed the idea Syria had allowed ISIS to flourish. He told Paris Match: 'You can’t end terrorism with aerial strikes. The Syrian border town of Kobane has been left in ruins following fighting lasting for two months between ISIS militants and Kurdish militants, who are defending the tow . Striking back against ISIS are Kurdish fighters, which include many women. They have played a major role in helping to defend the Syrian town . A Kurdish fighter takes his position in a bid to lure ISIS fighters to give their location in Kobane. ISIS controls large swathes of Syria and Iraq . Syrian president Bashar al-Assad pictured last month giving an interview to Paris Match magazine, which has been published today. He said that U.S. led airstrikes have made no difference in stopping ISIS . There are fears that ISIS has spread to Africa after the U.S. military confirmed they are closely monitoring reports that they are now training fighters in eastern Libya. Army General David Rodriguez, head of the U.S. Africa Command, said it was not yet clear how closely aligned the trainees were with ISIS. 'We're watching it very carefully to see how it develops,' Mr Rodriguez told reporters at the Pentagon. 'Right now it's just small and very nascent and we just have to see how it goes.' 'Troops on the ground that know the land and can react are essential. That is why there haven’t been any tangible results in the two months of strikes led by the coalition. 'In reality, Islamic State was created in Iraq in 2006. It was the United States which occupied Iraq, not Syria,' he said, adding the group's leader was jailed in a U.S.-run prison there. 'So who created Islamic State? Syria or the United States?' In the interview he also vowed to remain in power and said the war against the Free Syrian Army and ISIS would be long and difficult. The interview came as Islamic State militants launched an overnight attack against the last major Syrian military air base in the eastern province of Deir el-Zour. The Local Coordination Committees activist collective and the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights both reported the fighting for the airfield, which is just outside of the city of Deir el-Zour on the Euphrates River. The Islamic State group already controls almost the entire surrounding province as part of its self-declared state in Syria and Iraq. The heavy clashes began with a suicide bombing on a Syrian military position near the air base, the Observatory said, adding that at least 19 government troops and seven ISIS militants have been killed in the fighting.

"David Williams, 34, swindled more than £120,000 in benefits that he was not entitled to . A benefits cheat swindled £120,000 by claiming he was wheelchair bound, but was actually working as a TV aerial fitter and climbing onto roofs, a court heard. David Williams, 34, from Prenton, Wirral, dishonestly obtained state benefits over a period of eight years, including child tax credits where he claimed two of his daughters were severely disabled. He also callously charged an 88-year-old woman £7,500 for a fuse box, which he never even fitted, and used the money to buy a van for his satellite dish installation business, Go Digital Aerials. Williams appeared at Liverpool Crown Court on a mobile scooter and as he complained of hearing difficulties had to be wheeled into the body of the court for the hearing. A jury heard that the elderly woman had lost trust in anyone calling at her Wirral home afterwards and 'lived out the last year of her life effectively without opening the door'. Judge Dennis Watson QC said: 'The impact of the offence on her, I have no doubt, accelerated the decline in her health. You performed a wicked con trick on her, conning her out of £7,500 so you could buy yourself a van.' When her concerned friend and neighbour pursued the matter he 'blustered and bluffed and did your best to intimidate her',  judge said. By the time his dishonesty came to light he had obtained £120,878 in benefits over an eight year period. Some he obtained from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) by purporting he was too immobile to work. While the rest came from HM Revenues & Customs (HMRC) where he claimed the opposite - that he was working and needed top up working tax credits. He also obtained child care credits for his five children and 'particularly callously and cynically told lies that two were disabled,' said the judge. Liverpool Crown Court heard that when Williams told the DWP in 2005 that he was unable to walk he spoke of hoping for an operation so he could get back to work 'as I believe a man should provide for his family but I cannot at the moment.' Williams pleaded guilty to five DWP fraud offences spanning eight years and five trading standards offences involving fraud and engaging in unfair commercial practices. Judge Watson sentenced him to 39 months in prison and afterwards he had to be escorted by the dock officers to a suitable taxi to take him to prison - as the scooter was too large to get into the holding cells downstairs. Judge Watson said that while he accepted he has diabetes and complained of pain 'there is little objective clinical evidence of substantial medical difficulties.' Michael Davies, defending, said that Williams, who has previous convictions for fraud, had never been to jail and because of his 'bulk' he would find that difficult and his children would miss him. He added that he had mobility problems because of the affect on his legs of his weight. Kevin Slack, prosecuting, said that Williams began legitimately claiming incapacity benefit in 2002 and said he could no longer work as a welder because of pain in his knees. He was sentenced to 39 months in prison after he appeared in his mobility scooter at Liverpool Crown Court . But in 2005 when he claimed he was unable to walk at all he notified HMRC that he was working 16 hours a week as a carpet cleaner and claimed tax credits. Investigations later showed that been 2006 and 2012, £40,000 was paid into his bank account - mainly in cheques from his work activities, said Mr Slack. He also claimed child care credits claiming that his wife also worked 16 hours a week and the children were in a nursery costing hundreds of pounds a week. However,she was not working and they were not at a nursery and the prosecution claimed 'it was complete fiction'. In 2009 he said that two of his daughters were disabled so their credit claim would be enhanced. 'That was completely false, neither was disabled or in receipt of disability living allowance' he added. Williams had been claiming Disability Living Allowance for himself since 2006 and the next year when he renewed his claim he stated he needed a wheelchair to get around. He also told authorities that he needed his wife to care for him 'every hour of the day', could not get upstairs and needed help to feed himself. Mr Slack added that it was not claimed it was false from the start but by early 2010 there had been a significant improvement and he began running an aerial and satelilte dish installation business, involving climbing up ladders and onto roofs. The prosecutor said that the pensioner who Williams charged an 'exorbitant' amount for a fuse box had met him earlier and got in touch because he also dealt with electrical matters. After his deception came to light she was left upset, frightened, her health deteriorated and she no longer trusted anyone and kept her curtains closed. Meanwhile he banked her cheque and spent £4,840 on a new van which carried logos, as did his website, claiming he was affiliated with various trade bodies, which was untrue.

"It should have been the happiest day of their lives, a time for celebration and feasting on the £5,000 buffet spread. But for Mateisz and Joanna Golbow, both 22, their wedding day quickly turned in to a nightmare as almost the entire 120-strong guest list were struck down with food poisoning at the reception. The newly-weds realised something was awry when their guests kept disappearing to the toilet, before excusing themselves and making a swift exit. The couple (left) look elated on their special day, but the smiles quickly turned to frowns (right) when almost their entire guest were struck down with food poisoning and had to keep dashing to the toilet . The chicken, eggs and salad at the buffet spread at the reception all contained some dangerous bacteria . The guests, pictured here at the wedding, later complained about upset stomachs and vomiting from the food . But the couple were so busy entertaining their guests they had failed to eat any thing and did not notice the extent of the disaster until the end of the reception. The guests who attended the wedding in Rudolowice, a village in south-eastern Poland complained of upset stomachs, vomiting, diarrhoea and headaches. Recounting her 'special' day, the devastated bride said: 'Every hour there were fewer and fewer people as they disappeared into the toilets and then went home or to hospital. 'Me and Mateusz had been so busy enjoying ourselves and socialising, we hadn't bothered to eat anything so we didn't notice until the end. 'And as nobody wanted to ruin our special day they didn't tell us what the problem was until we phoned the next day and asked why everyone had left so soon. 'Then it became clear that with everyone having the same symptoms, it was food poisoning. Mateisz and Joanna Golbow, both 22, said the catering company that supplied the food had ignored them . Groom Mateusz added: 'Eighty people, including a one-year-old child, were treated for food poisoning. 'We then found out that the chicken, eggs and salads all contained some dangerous bacteria. 'We had to throw away more than £5,000 worth of food that had been left over and when we contacted the catering company they ignored us and now won't even answer the phone.

"A new curry sauce containing a third of the calories, saturated fat and salt, than similar Indian cooking pastes on sale, claims to be the healthiest on the market. The tikka masala in a jar has even been given a stamp of approval by health experts at Heart Research UK. Per 100g, Mum's Masala has just 100 calories, 0.5 grams of saturated fat and 0.7 grams of salt. Tikka masala is usually one of the most fattening of curries because it contains lots of butter and cream . Similar Indian sauces for sale can have three times as many calories, salt and sugar per 100 grams and significantly more health-damaging saturated fat. Tikka masala is usually one of the most fattening of curries because it contains so much butter and cream. Following his father's death from a heart attack, creator Narinder Gill was determined to develop a healthy version of the sauce his mother used to make in the family home every day. He claims his product will revolutionise Indian cooking. Mr Gill, 50, of Coventry, West Midlands, said: 'When my mum came to England she had brought the spices with her as curry was something very new here. Narinder Gill developed the healthy sauce . 'I remember her grinding all the different spices in a pestle and mortar to make a masala when I was a child. 'My mother-in-law still grinds all the spices together. 'The recipes she used were handed down from their mothers, grandmothers and great grandmothers.' 'After doing my homework to see what was available on the market, I realised there was a gap for a healthy Indian option so I set to work with a chef to develop a unique recipe that would help towards fighting heart disease. 'Our curry base takes people back to the traditional way of making curries, with fresh ingredients and without lots of butter. 'We are extremely fortunate to have Heart Research UK supporting us. 'I know my father would be very proud too.' TV chef and nutritionist Sally Bee, who has helped develop the product, said: 'I believe nutrition is the key to health and this is truly the first healthy curry I have ever seen.' A spokesman for Heart Research UK said: 'We are so impressed by the simplicity, quality and nutritional value of the range that we wanted to get behind it to educate the nation how to eat healthy, authentic curries. 'This is a major breakthrough in Indian cuisine as for the first time previously fat-laden dishes can be enjoyed without the risk to the heart and your health.' The £2.29 sauce, serving up to five people, is on sale exclusively in supermarket chain Morrisons.","Mum's Masala given stamp of approval by Heart Research UK .

"Two fisherman have had a frightening brush with fate after their small fishing boat was stalked by a six-metre long crocodile.

The crocodile stalked them along the river over 40 minutes before emerging just two metres from their boat. Scroll down for video .

Mr Thomsen, who managed to catch the encounter on camera, had to move his boat twice in order to get away but the crocodile kept following them. 'He came right up to us and eyeballed us. His head was about 80 centimetres long,' he told the ABC. 'I do see a few big crocodiles, but (this) is the closest and most worrying I've ever had. It scared the hell out of us. My heart was just going.' The crocodile stalked them along the river over 40 minutes before emerging just two metres from their boat . The experienced fisherman said he was unsure whether to approach the motor to try and get away or just sit tight on the boat. The pair ended up yelling at the crocodile and shooing it away.

"Britain should switch to a four-day working week to combat stress, a leading doctor has said. Professor John Ashton, president of the UK Faculty of Public Health, said that shorter hours would allow workers to spend more time with their families and help reduce unemployment. Reducing the standard working week from five days to four would also help combat medical conditions such as high blood pressure and mental health problems. Health benefits: Shorter hours would help beat stress and combat conditions such as high blood pressure and mental health problems. Britons are notorious for putting in some of the longest hours in Europe . Professor Ashton, who has spent almost 40 years working in public health, said: ‘When you look at the way we lead our lives, the stress that people are under, the pressure on time and sickness absence, [work-related] mental health is clearly a major issue. ‘We should be moving towards a four-day week because we problem we have in the world of work is you’ve got a proportion who are working too hard and a proportion that haven’t got jobs. ‘We’ve got a maldistribution of work. The lunch-hour has gone; people just have a sandwich at their desk and carry on working.’ Professor Ashton, who leads more than 3,300 public health experts working in the NHS, local government and academia, spoke out after the law was changed to give all employees the right to ask for flexible hours. This could mean anything from a three-day week to only working during the school term time – options that had been reserved for parents and carers. Britons are notorious for putting in some of the longest hours in Europe, with the average worker clocking up some 250 hours more a year than their German counterpart. 'Crazy hours': Professor John Ashton (pictured) said that some Britons are working too much . One in three British adults has high blood pressure, a ‘silent killer’ that trebles the risk of heart attacks and strokes. It can also damage the kidneys and eyes and is becoming increasingly linked to dementia. Around one in six workers is experiencing stress, anxiety or depression at any one time, the charity Mind says. Professor Ashton said that some Britons are working ‘crazy hours’, while others can’t get a job. He said that a shorter working week would give more time for exercise and family life, including the opportunity to do the school run. He told the Guardian: ‘We need a four-day week so that people can enjoy their lives, have more time with their families and maybe reduce high blood pressure because people might start exercising on that extra day. ‘If you’ve got two people in a couple working, they need to be able to work in such a way that they can spend time together with their children.  It’s a nightmare.’ A recent YouGov poll found that 57 per cent of workers are in favour of a four-day week. The Trades Union Congress agreed that many people would welcome as shorter working week but questioned how easy it would be to for them to obtain. Professor Ashton said: ‘The practicalities of implementing such a policy would be complex, not least because of the high cost of living that prohibits many people from working fewer hours. ‘Nevertheless, it is important that we have a working pattern that is good for our health as well as our economy and wider society.’","Four-day week would fight high blood pressure and mental health problems .

"Two brothers have been found dead after taking a new strain of the Class A drug ecstasy. University under-graduate Torin Lakeman, 19, and Jacques, 20, are believed to have bought super-strength MDMA – the chemical name for ecstasy – on the internet. The football fans were found in a flat above a pub in Bolton earlier this week after watching a Manchester United game at Old Trafford at the weekend. Torin Lakeman (left) and his brother Jacques (right) who both died together after they are are believed to have taken lethal doses of ecstasy . Yesterday university bosses in Aberystwyth, west Wales, where Torin was studying planetary and space physics, issued a warning to students about taking the drug. It is understood the brothers’ parents, Sarah and Ray, who are both teachers, were last night flying from the family home on the Isle of Man to formally identify their sons. Police say the deaths are not suspicious and have ruled out suicide. They are awaiting the results of toxicology tests and post-mortem examinations. On the advice of police, university vice-chancellor Rebecca Davies issued an email to students warning against taking ecstasy. Police said they were not treating the deaths of the two teens (Jacques pictured) as suspicious, and post-mortem examination and toxicology results have yet to be released . She said a ‘new strain’ being bought on the internet could have a delayed effect, prompting unsuspecting users into thinking it was not working and encouraging them to take more. ‘On taking the drug there is no immediate reaction,’ Mrs Davies said. ‘Users are then making the mistake of taking more of the drug in order to obtain a high, which – when both doses kick in – results in an overdose which in some circumstances can be fatal.’ Sarah Lakeman, 51, is a teacher of modern foreign languages at Castle Rushen High School on the island, where her sons went to school. The brothers were found dead in a room above the Grapes Inn in Stoneclough, Bolton in Greater Manchester at 2.15pm on Monday . Aberystwyth University, where Torin (pictured) was a student, emailed staff and students warning of the dangers of the drug . She lives in Port St Mary, with husband Ray, 64, who is also a teacher and served as a commissioner with the local authority in the town for several years. According to a statement issued by the school, Jacques had recently left the Isle of Man to live in London, while Torin went to study in Wales. It is understood the family are big Manchester United fans and the brothers were reportedly in Manchester for the team’s match against Hull on Saturday. Castle Rushen High School, where their mother Sarah Lakeman is a teacher, has said staff and students were 'deeply shocked and saddened' to hear of the deaths of the former pupils . They were staying in rooms above the Grapes Inn, in Stoneclough, Bolton, and are thought to have taken the drugs some time over the weekend. Their bodies were discovered on Monday afternoon. Castle Rushen staff described Jacques as ‘intelligent and talented’, and Torin as a ‘caring individual who would do anything for anybody’. Professor Qiang Shen, director of the Institute of Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science at Aberystwyth University, said Torin ‘will be sadly missed, and fondly remembered by staff and students alike’.","Torin, 19, and Jacques Lakeman, 20, were found together in a Bolton pub .

"When the residents of Hong Kong took to the streets en masse in late September, it took the rest of the world - and the authoritarian Chinese government - by surprise. One woman who wasn't surprised is Nicky Lau, a 34-year-old assistant film director who has been involved in the protests since day one and says she will never give up the fight for democracy. 'The government side has shown little inclination to help the issue,' she explains in a phonecall from the Far Eastern city. 'Things have become tense because there's no clear direction from them.' Tough: Nikki Lau, 34, has been campaigning for the right to direct elections since the 28th September . The protests first exploded into life on the 28th September, following months of anger at the Chinese government's refusal to allow directly elected representatives for Hong Kong. Although allowing the territory a measure of democracy was specified in the 1997 handover agreement, China has shown little inclination to fulfill its obligations - leaving locals furious. Now, the protests, which began as a small student movement, are in their third month - and demonstrators are showing no sign of backing down, despite mounting violence. Among them is Lau, who says she has endured being tear gassed and pepper sprayed during her weeks manning the barricades, while some friends have been beaten up. 'It was chaotic on the first day,' she remembers. 'There was lots of tear gas and pepper spray. I was situated on the front line and nobody knew what was going on.' The protests, which have become known as 'the Umbrella Revolution', have waxed and waned since the first demonstrators hit the streets, but exploded into violence on Monday. On guard: Nikki and her friends spent the first 45 days living, sleeping and eating at the barricades . Popular: Ms Lau said the tradition of democracy was established under British rule - and they won't give it up . A day later, the leaders of one of the three protects - Occupy Central with Peace and Love - announced they would hand themselves into the nearest police station. Lau has no plans to follow suit. 'I haven't been beaten up yet but some of my friends have and they've been arrested,' she explains. 'The extent that police will go to exercise their authority is just dreadful. When I was little, the Hong Kong police represented everything was right and just and now...it's just really sad to see the way they're exercising their right to bear arms and enforce the law.' Since the protests began, Lau's life has been on hold. To begin with, she spent all her time at the protest sites, even sleeping there. As the days stretched into months, she returned, sporadically, to work and went home to sleep. Nevertheless, her determination to keep protesting until change comes remains. Dangerous: Many were injured after protesters clashed with police late on Sunday night . Attack: Students have endured violence at the hands of fellow citizens who say protesting is bad for business . 'I am there with friends and I think wanting to be there, the need to be there is greater than the fear of what might happen to me,' she explains. 'A hundred things are going through your mind. I don't know what's going to happen but we want justice from the government in the matter of the electoral process.' The protests, she adds, are the culmination of years of frustration. 'I think Hong Kong is at a point where it's had enough with all the developments since the handover,' she explains. 'All these changes to the everyday lives of the people. Hong Kong is still at the forefront of freedom, democracy and justice - these were firmly rooted under British rule. 'It left us knowing we should speak out when there's dissent and that's what we are doing now. It has become so tense (between citizens and the government) that people can't stand back and let things just happen.' But not everyone is standing firm. Residents of Mong Kok, one of the poorer districts and one that is crammed with small traders, have attacked protesters, claiming they are bad for business. The Chinese authorities have also stepped up their campaign, unleashing police armed with tear gas and batons on the peaceful protesters and raising fears of a second Tiananmen Square. Frightening: Police officers have become increasingly willing to use force on the demonstrators . Dreadful: Nikki says she is disappointed in the way the police have behaved and expected much better . No surrender: Nikki says she and her fellow protesters won't give up until they have what they want . That incident, which took place in central Beijing in 1989, saw student protests brutally crushed by an army of 300,000 men who advanced on demonstrators with tanks. No one knows exactly how many died but estimates are between 200 and 2,000. Lau hopes that the same thing won't happen this time. 'I think the circumstances are different but the underlying issues are there,' she explains. 'Will it be a repeat of Tiananmen Square? Yes, in the sense that  student leaders are there fighting for democracy. No because times have changed. Chillingly, she adds: 'In any revolution bloodshed is inevitable and we're seeing some of that now. But protesters are smart and if more bloodshed happens, then they will be smart about it.' Should Lau and the protesters get their way, the end result will be a democratic voice for Hong Kong and Lau is hopeful that she will get the result she wants. 'I'm really hoping to see some sincerity coming from the government,' she adds. 'Something to show that they do hear what the people are saying and they are listening. 'At the moment we don't see any of that. I think unless we see some, the protests will continue. 'I think our voices will be heard in the end,' she adds. 'I don't think it's about winning, it's about making the city better. This is how we are showing the government that we're not happy.'","Nikki Lau, an assistant film director, has been a protester from day one .

"A vicar arrested with his daughter on suspicion of murdering her baby boy was so religious he would be mortified by any pregnancy ‘out of wedlock’, relatives said yesterday. But they added that they ‘can’t see him as a murderer’. Reverend Jim Percival and his daughter Ruth, 28, have been bailed after they were questioned for a second day over the death of the newborn, whose body was found at their £400,000 vicarage last week. Family members said he would take a dim view of illegitimate pregnancies because of his religious beliefs. Peter Simpson, the ex-husband of Mrs Percival’s sister Wendy, said: 'They are very religious. Because it was out of wedlock, they may think it sinful.’ He added: 'I can’t see him as a murderer. He was very placid.' Scroll down for video . Clergyman: Rev Jim Percival is being questioned on suspicion of murder after the body of a baby was found . Service: Parishioners at the Holy Trinity CE Church in Freckleton said prayers for their vicar and his family . Detailed: Police were conducting a fingerprint search at the vicarage where the body of a baby was found as detectives were granted extra time to question the boy's mother and her vicar father on suspicion of murder . Mr Simpson, 61, added: ‘Jim and Susan were not in contact with any of the family. I haven’t seen them in at least 20 years. 'We sometimes bumped into them in the town centre but I haven’t seen Ruth since she was a child.’ Police were called on Tuesday after reports that Miss Percival had given birth to a stillborn baby. But senior officers later declared his death to be suspicious. The vicar, his daughter and his wife Susan, 65, are also suspected of conspiracy to conceal the birth of a child. Today, Lancashire Police said all three had been bailed until March 5 next year. Last night it emerged that even regular members of Rev Percival’s congregation in the village of Freckleton, Lancashire, were unaware his daughter - described locally as a ‘large lady’ – was pregnant.

Custody: The family members remained in custody yesterday afternoon as police searched their home . Police sources say Rev Percival, 64, and his wife told them they had no idea their daughter was pregnant and were shocked and angry to find out she had given birth. But the couple insist the baby – thought to have been born in the bathroom – was dead when they reached him. An ambulance was called and their daughter was taken to hospital. They are believed to have told investigating officers the umbilical cord was wrapped around the baby’s neck, adding that their daughter must have kept quiet about being pregnant because she knew they would be mortified. Detectives are investigating whether Miss Percival confided in anyone in the village about the pregnancy and whether she hid it by wearing baggy clothing. Prayers were said for the family yesterday morning at Holy Trinity Church where Rev Percival had worked for 11 years. Stand-in vicar Rev Terry Scholz said it would be wrong to ‘jump to conclusions’. He added: ‘The (congregation) are all nice people and, like any family going through difficult times, they will pull together.’ Decision: Police, who have been given extra time to question the family, said yesterday that Rev and Miss Percival were no longer being held on suspicion of sex offences .

One 87-year-old parishioner said: ‘It’s very, very sad. I sat behind Ruth every week at church and never realised she was pregnant. Personally I think (the vicar) is excellent, pastorally he was great. He would regularly visit the sick and infirm. He was a nice man.’ Yesterday police said they were trying to identify the baby’s father, while forensic teams continued to search the vicarage. Police are also thought to be examining Mr Percival’s computer. Lancashire Constabulary said a post-mortem examination had proved inconclusive and further tests were being carried out. Police were yesterday granted another 30 hours to question the trio. Miss Percival is an office cleaner who is also believed to have worked as a dinner lady. Her father grew up in Putney, south-west London, and worked as a carpenter and joiner before training as a clergyman after an ‘overnight’ conversion aged 30.
