"By . Chris Pleasance for MailOnline . A Mormon University in Utah has removed  cards celebrating same-sex marriage from its bookshop because they violate the school's honour code. Card maker Hallmark apparently stocked Brigham Young University shop with 'Mr and Mr' and 'Mrs and Mrs' cards without realising that the religious school does not support same-sex unions. It is not known how long the cards were on the shelves for but they were quickly removed after pictures surfaced online, according to a university spokeswoman. Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, has removed 'Mr and Mr' and 'Mrs and Mrs' cards from its bookshop after card maker Hallmark stocked them without realising the religious school opposes same-sex marriage . The BYU code states that being attracted to people of the same gender is acceptable, acting on those feelings is a violation. Founded by Brigham Young, leader of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in 1875, the school was established as a strict religious institution. Founded as Brigham Young Academy, Mr Young is said to have told the principal: 'Remember that you ought not to teach even the alphabet or the multiplication tables without the Spirit of God.' Today it serves 27,000 undergraduate students and has sister campuses in Idaho, Hawaii and Salt Lake City. 'Homosexual behavior includes not only sexual relations between members of the same sex, but all forms of physical intimacy that give expression to homosexual feelings,' it states. BYU is owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which has stood behind its belief that marriage should only be between a man and a woman. Staff at BYU have spoken with the company about leaving similar cards off university store shelves in the future. The school doesn't plan on ending its contract with Hallmark. 'This was just someone stocking the shelves who wasn't aware,"" she said. ""We've been able to work with them.' A call to Hallmark wasn't immediately returned. Samy Galvez, president of the group Understanding Same Gender Attraction, said changes to the honor code in 2007 and 2010 allowed students to talk about their sexual orientation without fear of being expelled. Though he declined to comment on the greeting cards, calling it an accident, Galvez said he's generally found a welcoming environment at BYU. The BYU honour code states that while being attracted to people of the same sex is not forbidden, acting on those impulses is a violation .","Cards celebrating same-sex marriages were stocked in university bookshop .

"By . Reuters . Microsoft Corp is rushing to fix a bug in its widely used Internet Explorer web browser after a computer security firm disclosed the flaw over the weekend, saying hackers have already exploited it in attacks on some U.S. companies. Microsoft disclosed on Saturday its plans to fix the bug, which targets Internet Explorer versions 9 through 11. Those versions take up 26.25 percent of the browser market, according to FireEye, the cybersecurity software company that caught the bug. The bug, however, reportedly affects versions 6 through 11. Together, those versions dominate desktop browsing, accounting for 55 percent of the PC browser market, according to tech research firm NetMarketShare. Clean-up: Microsoft is rushing to fix a bug in its widely used Internet Explorer web browser after a computer security firm disclosed the flaw over the weekend . PCs running Windows XP will not receive any updates fixing that bug when they are released, however, because Microsoft stopped supporting the 13-year-old operating system earlier this month. Security firms estimate that between 15 and 25 percent of the world's PCs still run Windows XP. FireEye Inc said that a sophisticated group of hackers have been exploiting the bug in a campaign dubbed 'Operation Clandestine Fox.' FireEye, whose Mandiant division helps companies respond to cyber attacks, declined to name specific victims or identify the group of hackers, saying that an investigation into the matter is still active. It described the hackers as 'extremely proficient at lateral movement' and 'difficult to track.' 'It's a campaign of targeted attacks seemingly against U.S.-based firms, currently tied to defense and financial sectors,' FireEye spokesman Vitor De Souza said via email. 'It's unclear what the motives of this attack group are, at this point. It appears to be broad-spectrum intel gathering.' He declined to elaborate, though he said one way to protect against them would be to switch to another browser. The bug reportedly affects versions 6 through 11 of Internet Explorer . Microsoft said in the advisory that the vulnerability could allow a hacker to take complete control of an affected system, then do things such as viewing changing, or deleting data, installing malicious programs, or creating accounts that would give hackers full user rights. FireEye and Microsoft have not provided much information about the security flaw or the approach that hackers could use to figure out how to exploit it, said Aviv Raff, chief technology officer of cybersecurity firm Seculert. Yet other groups of hackers are now racing to learn more about it so they can launch similar attacks before Microsoft prepares a security update, Raff said. 'Microsoft should move fast,' he said. 'This will snowball.' Still, he cautioned that Windows XP users will not benefit from that update since Microsoft has just halted support for that product. The software maker said in a statement to Reuters that it advises Windows XP users to upgrade to one of two most recently versions of its operating system, Windows 7 or 8.","Microsoft says Internet Explorer bug is present in versions 6 to 11 - which dominate 55 percent of PC browser market .

"By . Hugo Duncan . The housing market is starting to cool as sky-high prices and tough new mortgage rules curb demand, experts say today. The number of house hunters contacting estate agents for the first time rose again last month but at the slowest pace since February 2013, according to the report. Inquiries from new buyers in London – where fears the market is overheating are particularly high – fell for the first time since January last year. The report, by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, suggests potential buyers are becoming more cautious in the face of soaring prices and lending restrictions. Number of house hunters contacting estate agents for the first time rose again last month but at the slowest pace since February 2013, a report by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors suggests (library image) Estate agents now expect prices in London to rise by an average of just under 5 per cent a year for the next five years – down from the 9 per cent they were projecting as recently as March. That would bring the pace of price increases in line with the national average and ease pressure on the Bank of England to step in to stop the market spiralling out of control. Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at RICS, said the market ‘remains relatively robust’ around the country. But he added: ‘What we are really seeing is some of the very strong upward momentum starting to come off the housing market, as a lack of supply, higher prices, more prudent lending measures and some of the talk from the Bank of England are creating a level of caution among sellers and buyers.’ The RICS report says tough new lending rules introduced in the Mortgage Market Review in April are helping to take the heat out of the market. Banks are ‘lending less’, the report claims, with the average loan-to-value ratio among first-time buyers edging down from 86 per cent in April to 85.3 per cent in May. Under the new rules, mortgage applicants have to pass through more detailed checks about their regular outgoings to make sure they can afford their payments even when interest rates rise. A shortage of properties coming onto the market are also putting off buyers, the report claims. Surveyors now expect UK house prices to increase by 3.6 per cent over the next 12 months – the lowest figure since December. A senior Bank official yesterday warned that an overheating housing market is the biggest threat to the British economy as it bounces back from the recession. Estate agents now predict that prices in London will rise by an average of just under 5 per cent a year for the next five years - down from the 9 per cent they were projecting as recently as March (library image) Ben Broadbent, who takes over as deputy governor next month, told MPs that the recovery in property prices could lead to an increase in risky mortgage lending. He said that would pose risks to financial stability if ‘left unchecked’ but added that the Bank’s Financial Policy Committee – set up to prevent another crisis – stands ready to intervene. ‘Domestically, the main potential threat lies in the housing market,’ said Mr Broadbent, who joined the central bank from Goldman Sachs three years ago. ‘I say potential because, as yet, growth in mortgage debt remains low.’ But he added: ‘The housing market is recovering. That poses a risk to financial stability if it is accompanied by sharp rises in the number of risky mortgages. ‘If the strength of the housing market threatens to increase credit growth to unsustainable levels it is clear that the FPC would have reason to intervene.’ Figures from mortgage lender Halifax last week showed the price of an average home rose by £223 a day in May in the biggest increase since records began more than 30 years ago. A separate report from the Office for National Statistics showed prices in London are nearly 25 per cent higher than their pre-recession peak. The figures piled pressure on the Bank to act to cool the housing market, particularly in the capital, where there are growing fears of a bubble. The housing market is expected to be high on the agenda when the FPC meets next week. Senior Tory MP Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, said the meeting ‘will be an important opportunity’ for the Bank to evaluate the risks stemming from housing.","Number of buyers contacting estate agent at slowest pace since February .

"By . Carolyn Hiblen for MailOnline . Actress Rosie Perez and Republican media pundit Nicolle Wallace are joining ABC's daytime chat show, The View, the network confirmed on Thursday. As first revealed by the MailOnline one month ago, Nicolle, 42, will join Whoopi Goldberg and Rosie O'Donnell on the panel for the program's new season, beginning September 15.

Bush's reelection campaign and was an adviser on John McCain's . 2008 campaign. Fellow newcomer Nicolle served as the communications chief during George W Bush's presidency and his 2004 re-election campaign, while she is a regularly featured political commentator for a number of TV news programs. Fans of The View may remember Wallace from three guest-hosting appearances on the show earlier this year. The way they were: Following the departures of Jenny McCarthy (left), Barbara Walters (second left) and Sherri Shepherd (second right), the two new signings will join returning hosts Rosie O'Donnell (centre) and Whoopi Goldberg (right) when the show returns on September 15 . According to reports, Wallace was one of the early frontrunners for the highly-coveted position following screen tests last month. While Perez's name has come somewhat out of the blue, she also guest-hosted in February and is already a well-established household name. It will be quite the juggling act for the actress, who has just signed on to star opposite Larry David in his Broadway production of Fish In The Dark, though Deadline reports that the producers are working to accommodate her schedule. The show will not only be back with a new cast on September 15 but a new studio, set, logo and crew, led by new executive producer Bill Wollf, following a huge revamp.

"By . Sarah Dean for Daily Mail Australia . and Aap . A thick blanket of heavy fog has created travel chaos for people heading into Melbourne Airport. Visibility has been reduced to about 150 metres at the airport and across the city. Photos of the city show its skyscrapers barely visible and the wings of planes just poking through the fog at the airport. The current batch of fog has been hanging around since Wednesday but bouts of it have been causing trouble for the past couple of weeks. Covered: The planes at Melbourne airport are barely visible through the fog that set in on Friday . Disruption: Melbourne's skyline has been covered in a thick blanket of fog on and off for weeks. On August 16 this picture was taken, with visibility reported at just 150m in some areas . Melbourne Airport spokeswoman Anna Gillett said the fog had forced some international flights to divert to other cities and some incoming domestic flights had been delayed but, at this stage, departures were not badly affected. 'We're advising people to jump on to their airline's website and check for updates to their schedules but at this stage come to the airport as normal,' Ms Gillett said. Bureau of Meteorology senior forecaster Terry Ryan said the fog should begin to lift later on Friday morning. Disappearing: The tip of a skyscraper can just be seen above the fog in Melbourne . Planes were grounded on Friday morning at Melbourne airport . Bemused: 'Melbourne covered in fog for the third morning in a row, starting to feel like Gotham City,' Kieran Jones said on Twitter on Friday . 'It should begin to lift at the airport around 10-ish but generally it will take a while to clear from the city area and the suburbs because it takes a while for the sun to heat things up,' he said. The fog should clear Melbourne by lunchtime, he said. Mr Ryan said a slow moving weather pattern with a high pressure ridge over Victoria and light winds had caused this week's foggy conditions. 'It's a very unusual weather pattern for this time of year,' he said. 'A pattern like this is normally associated with autumn.' Melbourne is expecting a sunny top of 18C on Friday, with sunshine and temperatures into the low 20C range over the weekend ahead of showers and a cooler change on Monday.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The Jaguar E-Type has been voted the greatest car of all time - and is one of eight British cars to feature in the top ten. New research revealed the E-Type, launched in 1961, is the most iconic car ever, topping a top ten list including the Mini, Rolls Royces and the VW Beetle. Aston Martin also had four cars in the top ten - the DB5, the DB9, the V8 Vanquish and the Vanquish. Scroll down for video . Most iconic car ever: The classic E-Type Jaguar, which was manufactured by Jaguar Cars Ltd between 1961 and 1975 . The research, by Discovery Channel's motoring series Wheeler Dealers, marks its new season, when it will feature its 100th car on the show. When asked to choose the best cars of all time, 32 per cent of Brits said the E-Type, with one in five opting for the Mini and 18 per cent the Porsche 911 - making up the top three. From a list of 100 classical cars spanning the decades, the Porsche 911 and the VW Beetle were the only non-British cars in the top ten. Meanwhile, the highest ranked Italian car was the Ferrari F40 which came in 11th place, a poll of 2,000 British drivers found. Ford had four inclusions in the top 25, headed by the Ford Capri (17th), Ford Mustang (19th) and Ford Cortina Mk 3 (20th). Mike Brewer, the show's car trading expert, said: 'This underlines the incredible heritage of British car manufacturing, where originality, style and performance have been the hallmarks of many of our greatest cars. British classic: There were four Rolls Royce cars in the top ten list of most iconic cars ever . The Aston Martin DB5 came in at number five in the list of most iconic cars . Best of British: The Mini was originally made by the British Motor Corporation and its successors from 1959 until 2000 when it was redesigned . 'As the classic car market continues to boom, we're seeing many popular productions being snapped up as future classics.' The German Volkswagen saw the Beetle - made famous through the 'Herbie Goes' films - ranked above the highest placed Mercedes or BMW models. Indeed, the high performance sports grand tourer Mercedes SLR McLaren was in 44th place and the BMW 3 Series in 61st. Of the four French models in the 100-strong list, the Renault 5 Clio Williams (58th) pipped the Peugeot 205 GTI (63rd). The Jaguar E-Type topped two other polls, with the Roadster version being voted the greatest ever convertible and the E-Type named the best classic car of all time. Wheeler Dealers has seen presenters Mike Brewer and Edd China transform many run down classics into sleek and gleaming beauties. Edd said: 'It's good to see the Capri and the XR3i now joining the pantheon of classic popular production cars. 'As we unveil our 100th car in the series, we'll be aiming to return another hidden gem to its former glory.'","Research finds E-Type, launched in 1961, is the most iconic car ever .

"By . Sally Lee for Daily Mail Australia . A newly opened gluten-free schnitzel eatery in an Adelaide food court has offended customers with their 'racist' menu. Schnityz City-Cross offers an Asian style 'yellow fever' dish, 'Ranga, Gingers have souls' and 'Kunst, German word for art'. Customers have gone as far as urging others to boycott the fast-food store on social media. Customers have labelled the new menu at Schnityz City-Cross as 'racist' and 'offensive' Owner Tim Fitzpatrick says 'it won't be necessary' to change the menu at the store . 'Disappointed that you would feature such racist/offensive menu items. I won't be trying and will be letting others know,' Anika Johnstone wrote on Facebook. Kathy Hall was looking forward to the store opening until she saw the menu. 'It is racist and offensive,' she wrote. Andrew Coulson wasn't impressed. 'Nice bit of racism going on in Adelaide...avoid,' he wrote. Jones Vanessa also wrote: 'Not clever or funny in the slightest.' However owner Tim Fitzpatrick says the menu was designed in good humour. The fast-food store officially began trading on Wednesday . 'It's a bit of tongue-in-cheek fun,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'The aim was to make our menu mainstream and commercial with these names which also came as suggestions from staff.' Mr Fitzpatrick denies being racist and says the label couldn't be further from the truth.

"By . Jason Groves for the Daily Mail . Iain Duncan Smith yesterday became the first cabinet minister to indicate he will campaign to leave the EU unless the Prime Minister achieves major reforms. The Work and Pensions Secretary warned David Cameron that he must ‘step up the gas’ on Europe to claw back powers from Brussels. He spoke out following Eurosceptic Tory MP Douglas Carswell’s dramatic defection to Ukip on Thursday. Under pressure: The Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith (right) warned David Cameron that he must ‘step up the gas’ on Europe to claw back powers from Brussels . He said he disagreed with Mr Carswell’s decision but, as Ukip stepped up claims that more Tories are poised to defect, he acknowledged that the Conservatives need to do more. Mr Duncan Smith, who made his name as a Tory rebel on Europe, said: ‘I will make my mind up when I see what the Prime Minister brings back and I will then campaign accordingly. When the Prime Minister comes back [from negotiations] he will have to decide himself what he campaigns for – he will have to decide whether what he has brought back is sufficient.’ Tory insiders yesterday said Mr Carswell’s move had piled pressure on Mr Cameron to pledge at October’s conference that he will lead the campaign to leave Europe if he  cannot negotiate a better deal for Britain. A senior Tory suggested it was ‘inevitable’, adding: ‘The only question now is whether he can afford to wait until conference.’ But another senior Tory said Mr Cameron was undecided about whether to make the announcement in his speech on October 1– only a week before the expected date of the by-election forced by Mr Carswell in his Clacton, Essex, constituency. Wake up call: Mr Smith spoke out following Eurosceptic Tory MP Douglas Carswell's (pictured) dramatic defection to Ukip on Thursday . ‘The question is whether it makes sense to try to draw a line under the European issue just a week before this very tricky by-election,’ the source said. Mr Cameron last night warned potential Tory defectors their ‘bizarre’ behaviour could hand the election to Ed Miliband – and wreck hopes of an in/out referendum on Europe. He said: ‘It does seem to me pretty strange to leave the party that is guaranteeing an in/out referendum and join the party that can’t guarantee anything apart from the danger of a Labour government.’ Ukip has stepped up predictions that more Tory and Labour MPs will join the party.  Millionaire donor Stuart Wheeler confirmed revelations in yesterday’s Daily Mail that he has wined and dined eight Tory MPs and said he could ‘easily have got another eight’. He said: ‘I didn’t say “Would you defect?”. I would say “Would you like to meet Nigel Farage?”. Some said yes and obviously Douglas Carswell was one of them. The number of people I took out to lunch was about eight. Now, I’m not saying they are all thinking of crossing the floor. But equally there is another eight I could have easily taken out.’ Mr Wheeler said at least two Tory MPs were now in serious talks about defecting. Ukip leader Nigel Farage said it is also in talks with a small number of Eurosceptic Labour MPs. He spent yesterday morning campaigning with Mr Carswell in Clacton. Mr Carswell denied he had been disloyal to Mr Cameron, but added: ‘Once I realised that it was all about winning the election and not about real change, I said enough’s enough.’","Mr Smith said he will campaign to leave EU unless there are major reforms .

"By . Tara Brady . A photographer is taking pictures of dead animals which look like they are happily sleeping to help owners deal with their loss. In one image, a dog is captured lying on chair in the garden comforted by a rug and a book. In another, a cat looks content wrapped up in warm in a baby pink blanket. Peaceful portraits: An elderly woman's cat puts its paws up and rests in a highchair in the sun . Emir Ozsahin said when he lost a close friend it made him think about . death and ways in which he could use photography to help him and others . through a difficult time. His friend was killed in a road accident and she was just 19. Mr Ozsahin said: 'I couldn't get out of my head the image of her body covered with newspapers. Deceased: A dog lies on a chair in the garden comforted by a blanket and with a book to 'fall asleep' reading . Content: A sparrow sleeping on a miniature bed photographed by Emir Ozsahin . At peace: A dead kitten sleeping in a basket wrapped up in a pink blanket . 'While I was trying to get rid of this image, I realised that the image of her alive was fading away as well. 'Her last photograph shouldn't have been like that. Or I shouldn't have seen that photograph.' He said the project focuses on how the people the animals leave behind want to remember them. 'I . worked with animals, and because they are really close to humans, they . feel like us. And we humanise them as our human born babies. Tranquil: A guinea pig resting in a warm jumper on a bed of purple flowers . 'With . the frames I will try to create, it's about how my subconscious . processes them, about the reality we know and how we try to forget what . happens after death.' He contacted several vets asking them to tell their patients about his work. To create the project he ordered pieces of mini furniture to fit the animals including a tiny bathtub for the Kingfisher bird. The photos were taken in his parent's garden in Istanbul. An adult cat photographed on the wooden highchair belonged to an elderly lady. 'I was really shocked when I learned that an older woman would want to have her cat's picture taken. Nodding off: A dead Kingfisher bird is photographed lying in a tiny bathtub . 'I always thought elderly people would have second thoughts about the idea of this project. All of the other animals were sadly from the streets or animal shelters and could not be cured. The photographer said: 'So it was more touching that way, they died on the streets or from an illness all alone.' A peacock adorned with flowers is photographed by Emir Ozsahin who takes pictures of dead animals . After completing the project he buried the animals himself and says the photographs act as a memorial to the animals that passed. He said: 'By humanising deceased animals and showing them as if they were sleeping, I tried to briefly touch death and create a series of photographs about pushing away the feeling of disappearing before it hits us hard in the face. 'I'm seriously not sure if this is an escape or an acceptance for me. All I know is that the photographs have a positive effect on me.'","The images were taken by Turkish photographer Emir Ozsahin .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Updated: . 12:48 EST, 18 June 2011 . Facing extradition: Student Richard O'Dwyer ran the TVShack website . A British university student faces being extradited to the United States for hosting a website which provided links to downloadable pirated films and TV shows. Undergraduate Richard O'Dwyer, a student at Sheffield Hallam University, was arrested late last month and is accused of criminal copyright infringement by U.S authorities. The 23-year-old could now be extradited to America to face trial there, in a case echoing that of Gary McKinnon, the computer hacker who has spent years fighting U.S. extradition. Mr O'Dwyer, who lives in student accommodation in Sheffield city centre, was first visited by U.S. officials last year when he ran the site TVShack. The website, which he has since shut down, provided links to other sites where users could download pirated films and TV shows like The Hangover and Lost. The student appeared before Westminster Magistrates Court this week for a preliminary hearing into the planned extradition, which he is strongly contesting. Still studying: Mr O'Dwyer is currently reading computer science at Sheffield Hallam University . Jailed: The 23-year-old was made to stay overnight at Wandsworth Prison until his family could answer the £3,000 bail . His mother, Julia O'Dwyer, from Chesterfield, said the case was 'beyond belief' and the possibility of extradition was 'madness.' She said: 'The first we knew about it was this visit from the police and the American officials in November. 'He shut the website down the very next day and I don't think he expected it to go this far. 'But then in May he had to spend the night in Wandsworth Prison as the court was too slow for us to sort out his passport and bail.' Mr . McKinnon’s ordeal began almost a decade ago when he hacked into Nasa . and other military computers from the bedroom of his North London flat, . searching for evidence of ‘little green men’. Over . the past decade, the British courts have repeatedly refused to block . the 45-year-old Asperger's sufferer's extradition, despite doctors . saying he will kill himself if bundled on to a plane to the U.S. Mr . McKinnon’s hopes of avoiding extradition to the U.S. suffered a severe . setback last month when Barack Obama declined to allow him to be tried . in Britain. Mr O'Dwyer spend the night in jail and was only released after his mother paid a £3,000 bail fee. Mrs O'Dwyer, a nurse, added: 'Richard . clearly has a talent for web design but was foolish in not . understanding the implications of copyright. 'Yet . to try to haul him off to America for trial while he’s midway through . his university studies is so utterly disproportionate it defies belief.' The . UK's 2003 extradition agreement with the USA, which came in for heavy . criticism in the Gary McKinnon case, is thought to be at the centre of . the latest row. The law . currently contains no proviion for 'forum', a legal term referring to . judges being allowed to consider whether a case is heard in the UK or . abroad. Mr O'Dwyer's . family have argued that since the student has not been to America since . he was a child and he did not have any copyright material on his . website, the case should be heard in the UK. His barrister, Ben Cooper, told the . preliminary hearing at Westminster Magistrates Court on Tuesday: 'The . computer server was not based in the U.S. at all. 'Mr O'Dwyer did not have copyright material on his website; he simply provided a link. 'The contention is that the correct forum for this trial is here in Britain, where he was at all times.' Legal fight: Mr O'Dwyers lawyers argued that the student should not be extradited the the U.S. as his site was not hosted no American servers . The student's legal team will argue that he should not face extradition as the site he ran was not hosted on U.S. servers. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement seized the web address TVShack.net last July. Mr O’Dwyer moved it to TVShack.cc, but that was also seized later last year. Julia O'Dwyer said her son shut down the site after being contacted by police.","Undergraduate faces U.S. trial for copyright offences .

"By . Sally Lee for Daily Mail Australia . Owen Beddall knows he's no supermodel but he didn't think that would be an issue when he was being interviewed on TV as an author for his recently released book. So it came as a rude shock for the Sydney-sider when he was turned down by a number of shows in Los Angeles because he didn't have 'the Hollywood look'. The author of Confessions of a Qantas Flight Attendant: True Tales and Gossip From The Galley was told by U.S. producers that he needed to lose 45kg and further suggested that he sign up for reality weight-loss series The Biggest Loser. But the 38-year-old was then told he couldn't feature on the American version of the show as it would be difficult for the American audience to understand him as he doesn't speak 'proper English'. Owen Beddall worked for Qantas from 2001 to 2013. He is now the author of Confessions of a Qantas Flight Attendant: True Tales and Gossip From The Galley . Mr Beddall met Russell Brand (left) and Katy Perry (right) during his time as a first-class flight attendant for Qantas . Beddall began his five-week international book tour in July for his tell all-memoir, which documents his 12 years attending to the needs and whims of the rich and famous as a first class Qantas flight attendant. He told Daily Mail Australia that he always knew he would write a book about his high-flying experiences. The 38-year-old began writing the book in 2011 after he broke his back . 'I wanted to keep note of the funny things because flight attending isn't your average job,' he said. But it wasn't until Beddall became paralysed after breaking his back when he slipped down some stairs in 2011 that he put his plan into action. 'Those moments were dark for me as I was in hospital for two months and had to learn to walk again,' he said. 'So I wrote the book as a cathartic experience and it really helped.' While his road to recovery continues, Beddall says his medication and physical restrictions has resulted in his 30kg weight gain. Beddall, who already felt uncomfortable about his body, didn't think he would face scrutiny on his appearance whilst on a book tour. 'My agent had sent over some TV reels to the LA producers who then cancelled my interviews,' he said. 'I couldn't understand why and then was told that the producers said that I should lose 100 pounds then come back. 'It was so ridiculous because I was being held to the same standards as Kate Moss and Miranda Kerr. 'I thought as an author I would be judged on my intelligence and not for being a Victoria's Secret model. 'It really made me think that LA really is the heartland of stupidity.' It was then suggested that he apply for The Biggest Loser in the U.S. 'But then when we looked into it I was told that I spoke too fast, my humour was too bitchy and that I don't speak proper English so it would be hard for the American audience to understand what I'm saying,' he said. Beddall says his tour was an eye-opener and taught him to be 'thick-skinned'. 'I also think its important to make the point that men are equally scrutinised and criticised about their weight even if it isn't as openly discussed,' he said. Mr Beddall highlights of his 12-year career for Qantas in his tell-all memoir . Beddall reveals the experiences he had as a first-class fight attendant on Qantas . Beddall's book highlights incidents such as being on a flight with Olympic gold medalist Grant Hackett who badly affected by Stilnox on a flight. He also met comedian Russell Brand and singer Katy Perry as they returned from their 'first date' in Phuket.  He said Perry was so down to earth she could have been any other passenger. He further recounted the moment British singer Lily Allen was 's***faced' from booze whilst he was on duty. The author has already started on his second book and looking creating his first into a film.

"By . Jason Groves for the Daily Mail . and Ian Drury for the Daily Mail . Extremist taskforce? David Cameron set up a team after Lee Rigby was hacked to death by cleaver-wielding fanatics in broad daylight last May . Ministers faced a storm of criticism last night over the failure to halt the radicalisation of British Muslims amid claims up to 2,000 may have travelled to Iraq and Syria to fight. Downing Street was forced to admit plans to prevent youths being brainwashed by jihadists, ordered following the horrific murder of Lee Rigby, have been gathering dust for months. Prime Minister David Cameron set up an ‘extremism taskforce’ after the 25-year-old British soldier was hacked to death by cleaver-wielding fanatics in broad daylight outside Woolwich Barracks, South-east London, in May last year. But as anger mounted over the beheading of American journalist James Foley by a masked Islamic State militant with an English accent, it emerged none of the group’s main recommendations had been implemented. The extraordinary development fuelled concern the Government was failing to get a grip on fanatics who were ‘hijacking’ UK youths. Khalid Mahmood, Labour MP for Birmingham Perry Barr, said the true number of young British Muslims who have gone to fight with Islamic State was far higher than the official estimate of 500. He said: ‘It is closer to 2,000. I know there are still people going. 'There are no real effective controls at the borders, either on exit or coming in. 'When the Prime Minister says there is a real threat to the UK he is right, but what is he doing to stop that? He’s doing nothing.’ Mr Cameron’s taskforce reported back in early December with a long list of recommendations, including the introduction of ‘terror Asbos’ to curb the activities of hate preachers, bans on groups that ‘seek to undermine democracy or use hate speech’ and new powers to make it easier for the Charity Commission to close down groups raising funds for terror organisations. But none of the key findings has been acted upon. Only a crackdown on extremist websites is under way but even then only 57 sites have been shut down. In a much-vaunted speech on terrorism in Munich in 2011, Mr Cameron also pledged to make Britain ‘a lot less’ tolerant of Muslim fanatics who whip up hatred. He argued that the UK had been too passive and said the West must ‘wake up to what is happening in our own countries’. The British Black Beatle (left) who murdered journalist James Foley is one of at least 500 Britons fighting for ISIS - and 250 of them are believed to back already, including Abu Abdullah Al Brittani (right), 32 . Mashudur Choudhury, 31, became the first Briton to be found guilty of travelling to Syria to fight. He failed the selection process to join extremists and blew cash borrowed from family to get there on foreign holidays . But three years later, not a single strategy document appears to have been published by the Government outlining what it plans to do about the problem. Ghaffar Hussain, managing director of counter-extremism think-tank Quilliam, said: ‘There is clearly a problem. ‘At least 500 people are fighting in Syria and Iraq and a lot more sympathise with the jihadists’ view and that is disturbing. ‘The Government has not really got a grip on it. The taskforce is a prime example of that. Some very good statements are made but nothing happens, even though huge numbers of people are being attracted to this crazy ideology.’ Mr Ghaffar said the UK’s Muslim community was also to blame for the failure to tackle radicalisation. He said it was in denial and prone to ‘ridiculous conspiracy theories’. Professor Anthony Glees, of the Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies at the University of Buckingham, said: ‘Why are there Brits there? In my view this is because Islamist extremist ideologies have been able to be spread with relative ease in our country under the cover of religion, free speech and multiculturalism.’ Three men who produced a propaganda video for ISIS from Iraq spoke in English accents . 'Terror Twins' Salma and Zahra Halane, both 16, who have 28 GCSEs between them, fled Manchester for Syria, have married warlords and hope to train as doctors to treat ISIS fighters . Former security minister Pauline Neville-Jones said: ‘There’s a huge task to be done of staunching the flow of people (to Syria). 'There are various things that the Government can do, particularly in cooperation with the Turkish government, to disrupt the flow of people and prevent them actually getting over the border, and that has now become an extremely urgent task.’ During the 1990s, the threat of Islamic extremism was not taken seriously as security chiefs focused resources on foiling attacks by terror groups in Northern Ireland. Hate preachers such as hook-handed fanatic Abu Hamza were allowed to come to Britain and spout anti-Western bile. In the wake of the July 7, 2005 bombings in London, in which 52 innocent people were murdered, Tony Blair launched the ‘Prevent’ strategy, a £200million-plus scheme intended to stop young Muslims from becoming radicalised. Ifthekar Jaman (left), 23, died last year in a battlefield clash 2,000 miles from his Hampshire home last December after bragging how life in Syria was '5-star' jihad. Amer Deghayes, 20, (right) is fighting in Syria . Abdul Waheed Majeed was a father-of-three from Sussex who became the first Briton to blow himself up . Francois Hollande has suggested ‘major powers’ including the UK and US are to blame for the rise of Islamic State militants. The French president hinted that a Commons vote last year, when MPs rejected David Cameron’s motion of using force in Syria if necessary, was partly behind the rise of the terror group in Syria and Iraq. He said in an interview with French newspaper Le Monde on Wednesday: ‘If, two years ago, we had acted to ensure a transition, we wouldn’t have had Islamic State. ‘If, one year ago, the major powers had reacted to the use of chemical weapons, we wouldn’t have had this terrible choice between a dictator and a terrorist group.’ Mr Hollande said France delivered weapons to rebels battling President Assad’s regime ‘a few months ago’. He added that France ‘should not stop the support that we have given to these rebels’, but that the country ‘could not go it alone’. In August last year, the Prime Minister was humiliated when Labour MPs and Tory rebels defeated the motion, ruling out military action against Assad. But by 2009 the Labour government was forced to admit it had been a disastrous failure, with money actually bankrolling extremism. Councils and police – in charge of handing over public funds to supposedly moderate Muslim groups – had made ‘serious mistakes’, said a hard-hitting think-tank report. A Government source said: ‘Discussions are continuing across Government on the implementation of the taskforce findings. It is not true to say we are doing nothing. We are working to tackle extremism in a number of areas, including schools, colleges and prisons.’ A Home Office spokesman said: ‘Extremism of any kind has absolutely no place in our society. We have a wide range of powers at our disposal to disrupt travel and manage the risk posed by returnees, including prosecuting those who break the law.’","David Cameron created 'extremist taskforce' in wake of Lee Rigby killing .

"By . Sarah Griffiths for MailOnline . In two weeks, Apple is set to show off the features of its eagerly anticipated iPhone 6 handset. But while the world waits for the new smartphone, engineers at the firm's headquarters in Cupertino, California, are busy patenting futuristic features that could one day appear in iPads and iPhones. In a patent granted today, plans are revealed for a mobile device with a flexible screen with hidden buttons beneath its surface. In a patent granted today, plans are revealed for a mobile device with a flexible screen. This image shows how temporary  raised buttons (22) could push upwards under a screen (102) on demand, giving users the feeling of pushing a physical button, like the home button on an iPhone . The patent granted by the US Patent and Trademark Office suggests that buttons and microphones could  be hidden by the screen in a number of ways. In one scenario, future mobile devices would feature physical buttons - such as the Home button - embedded under their displays, which would flex or 'deform' to enable users to push them down, Apple Insider reported. In another scenario, the screen could be placed over actuators - tiny motors. They would press upwards to generate temporary buttons on-demand anywhere on the screen and provide haptic feedback. By hiding 'buttons' under a screen using either method, Apple could expand the size of an iPhone or iPad screen, without making the devices themselves bigger and bulkier. While these functions appear to be predominantly intended for the iPhone and iPad, the patent also shows how the technology could be incorporated into a MacBook’s trackpad, to create ridges (102) and make a future laptop (without a groove on its side) easier to open (pictured) The handset is expected to be unveiled on Tuesday 9 September and will come in 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch sizes. It is thought the phone could boast a flexible and scratch-proof sapphire screen, which is about to go into large-scale production in the US. The screen is tipped to be ‘Retina display+’ with a 1,704x904 resolution. Experts also predict a faster A8 processor, better rear-facing camera - possibly with changeable lenses -and wireless charging support. It may also include a heart rate sensor like the Samsung Galaxy S5. There is increasing demand for phones with larger screens, with Samsung among the manufacturers offering multimedia-friendly Phablets – a cross between a phone and a tablet. Apple is rumoured to be launching its iPhone 6 in two sizes - 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch – to cater to consumers who want a larger screen on their phone. The technology described in the patent could mean that Apple mobile devices of the future are ‘all screen’ and that they could grow or reveal buttons when a user needs them. The patent reads: 'The ability of a user to compress a component such as a button switch by deforming the flexible display may allow the area of a device available for visual display to be enlarged. 'For example, the active area of a flexible display may overlap a component such as a button or speaker.' 'Diaphragms' capable of being used as a speaker or microphone could also be hidden under the screen, according to the patent. While these functions appear to be predominantly intended for the iPhone and iPad, the patent also shows how the technology could be incorporated into a MacBook’s trackpad, to create a large ridge that would push up the laptop's lid. This could mean that future MacBook designs will be more streamlined and that there will no longer be a ridge to open them. As with any patent, there is no indication about whether the technology described really will feature in a future product. By hiding buttons under a screen, Apple could expand the size of an iPhone or iPad screen, without making the devices bigger. Consumers are increasingly demanding larger handsets and the iPhone 6 is rumoured to come in two sizes - 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches. Leaked images of the rumoured handsets are shown .","Patent reveals iPhones and iPads could one day have flexible screens .

He told MailOnline: ‘Many times, when faced with personal threat, it becomes almost impossible to take the smartphone out from your pocket or handbag, unlock it, and send out an emergency message. ‘In such situations, the spotNsave wristband could make all the difference in broadcasting that crucial SMS with your location data to loved ones.’ When users first set up the bracelet, they use the app (pictured) to select their five emergency contacts. The bracelet works alongside a free Android app and a version for iPhones is launching soon . The bracelet has an SOS button that when pressed twice sends a text message to up to five ‘guardian angel’ contacts. These contacts can be selected via a free Android app. The SOS text includes a link to the wearer’s location, which is marked on Google Maps and updated every two minutes. Guardian angels can see a wearer’s location at any time they choose. The bracelet costs $45 (£27) including shipping and a pendant version is also available. It is made from waterproof rubber and comes in three colours: black, brown and white - with bright colours planned. The bracelet is designed to appeal to women and senior citizens, particularly in economically less developed countries. To call for help, a user only needs to press the SOS button on the bracelet twice in quick succession. This action lets them send a text message to five emergency contacts or ‘guardian angels’. This message includes the wearer’s location and also marks their coordinates on Google Maps every two minutes. Mr Jagtiani came up with the idea for his smart band after a close friend was abducted and tortured in a case of mistaken identity, he told The Wall Street Journal. ‘That incident instilled ideas in my mind as to what we could do to save someone or how someone could send out their location in an emergency,’ he said. When users first set up the bracelet, they use the app to select their five emergency contacts. And although a call for help can be sent simply by tapping the button on the band, an emergency message can also be sent by using a linked smartphone’s power button or via the app itself - much like other rival safety apps. Mr Jagtiani told MailOnline that his target users are women, senior citizens and visually impaired people and he has found the bracelets are in demand by middle class people in developing countries. The bracelet costs $45  (£27) including shipping and there is also a pendant version available for the same cost via the spotNsave website. Mr Jagtiani claims that he sold 880 of them in the first two months they were available.","Wearers of the spotNsave bracelet can send an SOS text message to emergency contacts by discretely tapping a button on it twice .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan for MailOnline . Ever 'had to go' while swimming in the ocean but felt guilty about polluting the water? Well, feel guilty no more - according to the American Chemical Society (ACS) peeing in the ocean is not only harmless, it is actually good for marine life. In a video, it says the components of urine pose no threat to life in the ocean, and if anything they can be beneficial - but they add peeing in enclosed areas like pools is a big no. We shouldn't feel guilty about going to the loo in the ocean, say experts from the American Chemical Society. With a similar composition to sea water, urine will not dramatically alter it . A lot of people will no doubt have encountered the problem of going for a swim in the sea before realising they need to go to the toilet. Researchers have warned that urinating in swimming pools could lead to health problems. Scientists found that compounds in urine mixed with chlorine can cause chemicals that have been linked to respiratory effects in swimmers to form. They warned swimmers to stop the common practice after analysing samples. 'If swimmers avoided urinating in pools, then air and water quality would likely improve independent of other changes in water treatment or air circulation,' the scientists from China Agricultural University and Purdue University wrote in the journal Environmental Science & Technology. But rather than facing the daunting trek back to a bathroom on land, they choose to relieve themselves in the water unbeknown to others. The ACS says it is ‘absolutely okay’ to go in the ocean in a video on Youtube for the channel Reactions. The first reason for this is that urine is mostly water, with the average human’s urine composed of 95 per cent water, while also containing sodium and chloride ions. By comparison, sea water is about 96.5 per cent water and also contains sodium and chloride, albeit in a higher concentration. Both also contain potassium, so all in all urine won’t dramatically alter sea water in its vicinity. The video explains urea in urine can actually be beneficial as it creates ammonium that feeds ocean plant life, so going to the loo when you're down at the seaside (Bournemouth beach during the Air Festival 2013 shown) is fine. But they add that peeing in enclosed areas like swimming pools is not encouraged . Another factor at play is urea, which is the main waste product in urine. ‘As our bodies break down proteins in food urea is the leftover compound that gets rid of the excess nitrogen in our bodies.’ But the amount of urea released, especially in proportion to an entire ocean, is tiny. For example, the volume of the Atlantic Ocean is 350 quintillion (18 zeroes) litres. Apparently even if everyone went to the toilet in the ocean, there would still be a miniscule 60 parts per trillion of urea in the water. In addition, urea contains a lot of nitrogen, which combines with water to produce ammonium. Ammonium, in turn, feeds ocean plant life - meaning it is actually beneficial. And finally, the video points out that every animal in the ocean also pees in the water; a whale, for example, can let out 970 litres of urine per day. ‘So if they’re not harming things, you certainly aren’t as well,’ the video says. They add, however: ‘Don’t pee in protected areas like reefs or smaller bodies of water, especially swimming pools.’","According to a video created by the American Chemical Society, we should not feel guilty about going to the loo in the ocean .

"By . Mark Prigg For Mailonline . The Earth's atmosphere contains an unexpectedly large amount of an ozone-depleting compound banned over 25 years ago. Nasa scientists have admitted they are baffled by the discovery of Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), which was once used in applications such as dry cleaning and as a fire-extinguishing agent. It was regulated in 1987 under the Montreal Protocol along with other chlorofluorocarbons that destroy ozone and contribute to the ozone hole over Antarctica. Scroll down for video . Satellites observed the largest ozone hole over Antarctica in 2006. Purple and blue represent areas of low ozone concentrations in the atmosphere; yellow and red are areas of higher concentrations. To investigate the discrepancy, Liang and colleagues used NASA's 3-D GEOS Chemistry Climate Model and data from global networks of ground-based observations. The CCl4 measurements used in the study were made by scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) Earth System Research Laboratory and NOAA's Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Model simulations of global atmospheric chemistry and the losses of CCl4 due to interactions with soil and the oceans pointed to an unidentified ongoing current source of CCl4. The results produced the first quantitative estimate of average global CCl4 emissions from 2000-2012. Parties to the Montreal Protocol reported zero new CCl4 emissions between 2007-2012. However, the new research shows worldwide emissions of CCl4 average 39 kilotons per year, approximately 30 percent of peak emissions prior to the international treaty going into effect. 'We are not supposed to be seeing this at all,' said Qing Liang, an atmospheric scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and lead author of the study. 'It is now apparent there are either unidentified industrial leakages, large emissions from contaminated sites, or unknown CCl4 sources.' As of 2008, CCl4 accounted for about 11 percent of chlorine available for ozone depletion, which is not enough to alter the decreasing trend of ozone-depleting substances. Still, scientists and regulators want to know the source of the unexplained emissions. For almost a decade, scientists have debated why the observed levels of CCl4 in the atmosphere have declined slower than expectations, which are based on what is known about how the compound is destroyed by solar radiation and other natural processes. 'Is there a physical CCl4 loss process we don't understand, or are there emission sources that go unreported or are not identified?' Liang said. With zero CCl4 emissions reported between 2007-2012, atmospheric concentrations of the compound should have declined at an expected rate of 4 percent per year. Observations from the ground showed atmospheric concentrations were only declining by 1 percent per year. In addition to unexplained sources of CCl4, the model results showed the chemical stays in the atmosphere 40 percent longer than previously thought. The research was published online in the Aug. 18 issue of Geophysical Research Letters. 'People believe the emissions of ozone-depleting substances have stopped because of the Montreal Protocol,' said Paul Newman, chief scientist for atmospheres at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, and a co-author of the study. 'Unfortunately, there is still a major source of CCl4 out in the world.'","Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) was used in applications such as dry cleaning and as a fire-extinguishing agent.

"By . Mark Prigg . The world’s oldest bottle of mineral water has been uncovered from the depths of the Baltic Sea by Polish scuba divers . Sailors enjoyed a tipple of gin 200 years ago, archaeologists have found. Stoneware bottle recovered from the wreckage of a sailing ship near Gdansk contains a sealed flask - and experts say it contains booxe. Researchers found the vessel contains 14% alcohol, and it could be a type of gin. Details will be known after further studies. The bottle has been recovered from the wreck, which rests on the bottom of the Gulf, at a depth of 12 meters, approx 4 km east of Gdynia Orłowo. The remains of the ship were discovered last year, during a routine survey of the bottom, by the staff of the Maritime Office in Gdynia. They notified the archaeologists from the National Maritime Museum, who in June and July conducted a survey of the wreck with the help of divers. Archaeologists recovered parts of the ship, including wooden blocks, but also fragments and whole specimens of ceramic and metal vessels, including a 30 cm high bottle. Stoneware dish was perfectly preserved and corked, and embossed writing 'Selters' suggested that inside might be soda water produced for several centuries near the village of the same name in the Taunus mountain range in Germany. In early July, archaeologists transferred the bottle to research laboratory J.S. Hamilton in Gdynia. 'They have found that the bottle contains 14% percent alcohol distillate, possibly diluted with water, whose chemical composition corresponds to that of Selters soda' - told Tomasz Bednarz, archaeologist with the National Maritime Museum, who led the work on the wreck. Bednarz added that according to the laboratory staff, the alcohol may be a kind of genever gin (jenever) - traditional liquor of the Netherlands and Belgium. 'Did someone really pour this drink into a soda bottle, or are we dealing with a different beverage? Experts will try to determine this in another series of analyses, which will be completed in early September' - said Bednarz. The archaeologist added that according to laboratory workers, the alcohol in the bottle is suitable for drinking. 'This means, it would not cause poisoning. 'Apparently, however, it does not smell particularly good' - he explained. Scroll down for video .

Produced between 1806 and 1830, the brown bottle is an extremely rare find as most sealed flasks from that period contain either beer or wine. Apart from the bottle, the team managed to recover parts of ceramics, a small bowl and a few pieces of dinnerware. Dr Bednarz said that while it’s likely the bottle contains original Selters water, he doesn’t rule out the possibility it was filled with wine. Selters is a German luxury mineral water brand which gained popularity with Europe’s wealthy during the nineteenth century. Produced between 1806 and 1830, the brown bottle is an extremely rare find as most sealed flasks from that period contain either beer or wine. Pictured here is the team recovering the 19th Century bottle . The scuba divers prepare to jump into the waters of Gdańsk Bay which is close to the Polish coast . Its springs were discovered around 1000 on the northern slopes of the Taunus mountain range, in Hesse, Germany. Many people claim that a few sips of Selters water, also known as 'fluid treasure', can boost strength and health. The springs of this mineral water went dry in the beginning of the 19th century and the characteristic stoneware bottles became rationed goods. In 1896, a group of enthusiasts from Selters organised a quest in order to find springs of the legendary water. Archaeologists found the 12 inch (30cm) bottle in shipwreck lying 12.2 metres (40 feet) below water in the Gdańsk Bay close to the Polish coast . Apart from the bottle, the team managed to recover parts of ceramics, a small bowl and a few pieces of dinnerware . After making a number boreholes, a fountain of crystal clear water exploded from one of the wells below Laneburg castle. Archaeologists hope the bottle will help identify the shipwreck in which it was found, which is currently only known only as F-33-31. They suspect the ship may have been a cargo vessel used for transporting goods such as along the Baltic coast. ‘So far, due to its preserved state and historical background, the stoneware bottle is our most valuable find,’ said Dr Bednarz. A man caused outrage in September after finding the world's oldest message in a bottle - and refusing to open it. Worn and battered, but still sealed, the elusive note has finally reached a reader - 1,115 miles and one century later. The green glass artefact was spotted sitting on the shore of the secluded Schooner's Cove in Tofino, Canada. Strolling along the recently excavated beach on a Monday morning, Steve Thurber noticed the bottle lying in the middle of an open stretch of sand. Determined to preserve what has stayed intact since September 29 1906, he has decided to leave the details of the message shrouded in mystery. All that can be read through the bottle - the cap of which is rusted over - is the date it was thrown into the sea, September 29 1906 and that it is signed by Earl Willard. It lists Willard's address and states that he was a passenger on a steamer from San Francisco to Washington and that he threw the bottle into the sea 76 hours into the voyage. The envelope, visible through the bottle, shows Earl Willard's address and where the letter was sent from .","The 12 inch (30cm) bottle was found in a shipwreck in the Gdańsk Bay .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Huge storms have been erupting on Uranus – and they are so enormous they can be easily seen using telescopes on Earth. The swirling clouds and violent winds are being driven by massive bands of jet streams that can surround the entire planet. Astronomers in Hawaii said they were 'surprised' by the bright storms they observed this week, including one that they described as 'monstrous'. Massive storms on Uranus captured August 5 and 6, 2014 as seen by Keck Observatory in Hawaii. Astrononers said they were 'surprised' by the bright storms, particulary one that they described as a 'monstrous' Uranus boasts a thick atmosphere with winds blowing at 560 mph (900 km/h). It has massive storms that could engulf continents on Earth, and temperatures in the -220°C (-360°F) range. Scientists believe the planet's strange tilt is the reason behind this bizarre weather system. The Earth has seasons because the axis tilts, and the hemisphere tilted towards the sun gets more light than that the region tilted away. These two pictures of Uranus -  one in true colour (left) and the other in false colour -  were compiled from images returned January 17, 1986. There were taken by the narrow-angle camera of Voyager 2 . But Uranus has an axis that runs almost parallel to the plane. It also spins backwards, compared to the other planets, making its tilt 98 degrees. This causes 21-year-long seasons and unusual cold weather. For nearly a quarter of the Uranian year - equal to 84 Earth years - the sun shines directly over each pole. Uranus boasts a thick atmosphere with winds blowing at 560 mph (900 km/h).

'We are always anxious to see that first image of the night of any planet or satellite, as we never know what it might have in store for us,' said Imke de Pater, professor at UC Berkeley and team leader. 'This extremely bright feature we saw on 6 August 2014 reminds me of a similarly bright storm we saw on Uranus's southern hemisphere during the years leading up to and at equinox'. 'Even after years of observing, a new picture of Uranus from Keck Observatory can stop me in my tracks and make me say Wow!', said Heidi Hammel, a member of the observing team. Since the 2007 equinox on the planet, Uranus's northern pole has been coming into view, and the south pole is no longer visible. The bright feature Professor de Pater refers to was known as the 'Berg', because it was visible just below the polar haze, and resembled an iceberg peeled off an ice-shelf. The Berg oscillated in latitude between southern latitudes of 32 and 36 degrees since 2000, and perhaps dated back to the Voyager era in 1986. The present storm is even brighter than the Berg. Its morphology is similar, and the team expects it may also be tied to a vortex in the deeper atmosphere. While today we know more about Uranus' amazing weather systems, when Voyager 2 went by in 1986 nothing much seemed to be happening. As the hurricanes Iselle and Julio gain in strength near Hawaii, it will be interesting to see how the storms on another world also continue to evolve.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . First-time buyers are bearing the brunt of Britain’s housing boom, with prices rising by more than 10 per cent in a year. People getting on to the first rung of the property ladder paid a record £199,000 in April this year, almost 10 times the average salary of people in their twenties. In the year to April prices for all buyers rose by 9.9 per cent, the biggest increase for four years with London values surging by 18.7 per cent to £485,000. Property prices for first-time buyers are rising by more than 10 per cent in a year, outstripping rises for people already on the housing ladder for the last year . The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics reveal the crippling impact of soaring prices on people trying to buy their first home. Prices for first-time buyers have soared since the start of the year, and in April were 10.7 per cent higher than the same month in 2013. For those already on the property ladder, prices are up by 9.5 per cent. It marks the biggest rises for new homebuyers for four years, and will fuel fears that the booming property market means the dream of homeownership is pushed even further out of reach for many. Every region has seen property values increase over the last year, from London's 18.7 per cent uplift to a 2.6 per cent annual rise in Northern Ireland. However, the dominance of London and the South East is skewing the picture of the property market. The UK average home is worth £260,059 but if London and the South East were removed from the findings, the average is just £199,000. Property values have jumped by 10.4 per cent across England over the last year to reach £271,000 on average, marking the strongest annual increase seen in English prices since 2010. England remains the only UK nation where prices are now higher than their pre-crisis peak in 2008. The average house price in the UK hit £260,000 in April, more than double the same time in 2002 . In London, prices are up 18.7 per cent, twice the national UK rate of 9.9 per cent . The house price index for London is now sitting 31.6 per cent above the pre-financial crisis peak reached for the English capital in 2008. The figures add to a slew of reports which point to house prices continuing on a strong upward march, despite some estate agents suggesting that in recent weeks sellers have started to flood the market. Further steps could be recommended by the Bank of England to calm the market, which could include diluting the Government's flagship Help to Buy scheme to help buyers with low deposits. Chancellor George Osborne last week warned that high deposits mean many young families are struggling to get on to the property ladder . Critics of the scheme have argued it has been adding to the pressure on demand for homes and helping to fuel sellers' price expectations as consumers' confidence in the economy improves generally. Chancellor George Osborne used his Mansion House speech last week to defend action to help people struggling to raise a deposit. ‘The average deposit required for a first time buyer is a staggering four fifths of annual income,’ he said. And in a swipe at the City financiers in the audience, he added: ‘I suspect almost everyone in this room owns their own home. ‘But I ask this: how many of you could have afforded the kind of deposit on your first house that many young families are expected to provide today? Very few of you. ‘Let’s be clear: the market is not functioning normally. And that’s why we’ve introduced Help to Buy. ‘I want to make sure an entire generation doesn’t miss out on the reasonable aspiration to buy a home.’ He unveiled plans to give the Bank of England new powers to limit the amount people can borrow. New rules will cap the size of loans to a multiple of the borrower's earnings, meaning that in areas where prices are rising by more than locals earn in a year, it will become even harder to buy a home . Campbell Robb, chief executive of charity Shelter, said the latest figures are evidence that 'house prices are spinning further out of control'. He continued: 'Worryingly, as house prices continue to rise, some will be tempted to overstretch themselves in a frantic bid to get on the property ladder. 'But with interest rates currently at historic lows, it's a real concern that many might find themselves struggling to make ends meet in the future. 'Thousands of people are working hard and saving, now Government must meet them halfway by building the genuinely affordable homes they desperately need.'","Average price for first-time buyers hits £199,000 for the first time ever .

The girl told police that she and Workman had started speaking online about a month before they met in person. They arranged to meet near her parents’ house in northern Iredell County in late April. The girl then invited the man into the house and that is when he started to sexually assault her, investigators said. Workman of Albemarle, North Carolina, turned himself in to deputies on Monday after more than two weeks on the run . ‘Just the fact that he would be that brazen. To come up here and meet a girl online and then stay in her residence not knowing what her parents are or what they are about,’ said Iredell County Sheriff’s Office Lt. Bill Hamby. After interviewing the girl, deputies put out a warrant for Workman's arrest. 'I'm uncomfortable in my own home. I'm scared. I can't sleep at night,' the teenager’s mother said. She wants other parents to know the importance of monitoring their children's online activity. 'The internet has just ruined that poor girl. She was just taken advantage of,' she said. Investigators said Workman has a handful of prior arrests and faces charges in another sexual assault case.

"By . Corey Charlton for MailOnline . A British airman who was the inspiration for Steve McQueen’s character in the Great Escape has died at the age of 93. Flight Lieutenant Ken Rees was a prisoner of war and like McQueen in the classic movie he spent most of his time in solitary confinement. Proud Welshman Mr Rees was part of the legendary escape from Stalag Luft III camp and was named as the inspiration for the McQueen character in the 1963 film. Scroll down for video . Wing Commander Ken Rees, pictured in Anglesey, Wales, in 2003. He was the inspiration for Steve McQueen's character in the 1963 film The Great Escape, in which allied prisoners tunnel their way out of a Nazi POW camp . Mr Rees as a young man at the start of WWII (right) and as an older man during his career with the RAF (left) But modest Mr Rees said he had little in common with McQueen’s character - except for the amount of time they spent in 'the cooler'. After the film came out he said: 'He is taller than I am, I’m heavier than he is, he’s American and I’m a Welshman. 'The only things we’ve got in common is that we both annoyed the Germans and ended up doing stretches in the cooler. 'I didn’t get out and if I did, I wouldn’t have been able to ride a motorbike anyway.' Steve McQueen played Captain Virgil Hilts, the 'Cooler King' in the movie in which he is captured after leaping a barbed wire fence on a motorbike. Steve McQueen poses on the motorbike he rode in the film at the Swiss-German border. In reality, none of the prisoners escaped on a bike . The wreckage of Mr Rees' plane, pictured in 1969, after he was shot down over a lake in Norway as a young man in 1942 . If was from the crash in Norway that he was captured and taken to the infamous Nazi prisoner of war camp. The wreckage was found and pictured in 1969 . In reality, none of the prisoners used a motorbike to escape. Mr Rees was one of the men caught in the tunnel when the break-out was discovered by a German guard. Of the 76 escapees from Stalag Luft III camp, only three managed to reach Britain - the other 73 were recaptured, and 50 were killed. Only two of these escapees remain alive today - Dick Churchill, from Devon, and Paul Royle, who lives in Perth, Australia. A tunnel dug underneath the Stalag Luft III prisoner of war camp, from which 76 people escaped . Mr Rees, of . Ruabon, North Wales, joined the RAF at the age of 18 at the outbreak of . Second World War and flew Wellington bombers in raids over Germany. He became a prisoner of war after his aircraft was shot down in flames over Norway in 1942. The young airman was captured and taken to Stalag Luft III where it was considered the sworn duty of officers to escape. His . memory as a prisoner of war was being 'bored to tears', constantly . hungry and finding himself banged up in solitary confinement or the . ‘cooler’ as it was known by American prisoners. On . the night of the breakout, Mr Rees was lucky to escape with his life as . the last man to be pulled from the tunnel as German shots rang out in . the darkness. Mr Rees’s funeral will take place next Saturday at Bangor Crematorium in North Wales. The character Danny 'Tunnel King' Velinski, played by Charles Bronson, crawling through the tunnel in The Great Escape . The Great Escape's legendary motorbike chase scene starring Steven McQueen shows his character - based on Ken Rees - attempting to outrun Nazi prison guards on a motorbike. In reality, this element to the story was completely fabricated. None of the prisoners tried to flee on a motorbike. While 76 prisoners actually escaped, all except three were recaptured. Of this 73, 50 were soon recaptured and executed. Although the film was accurate in this respect, the ones who successfully made it home in the film were not the same as those who did so in real life. Although Mr Rees was Welsh, the movie producers made McQueen's character an American, presumably to give the film more appeal to U.S. audiences. Many other characters were composites, based on a number of real-life prisoners. In fact none of the prisoners involved in the real prison escape were American - they were entirely British and other Allied troops, including Australian and Canadian. American troops had been moved from the prison in the months before the escape tunnels were ready, although they had helped significantly with the digging.","Ken Rees inspired Steve McQueen's character in 1963 film The Great Escape .

He’s got a manager who is not confrontational but at the same time can instil discipline.

"By . Ciaran Gallagher . Barry McGuigan has hinted that he may be open to working with all parties as he attempts to negotiate a number of promotional issues ahead of Carl Frampton's first world-title defence – which could open the door to a showdown with Scott Quigg. The Belfast man became only the 20th Irish fighter to claim a legitimate world professional title last Saturday night, defeating Spaniard Kiko Martinez for the IBF super-bantamweight crown in front of a 16,000-capacity crowd in his native city. Frampton now faces a mandatory title defence against American Chris Avalos which is due to take place within 90 days, while a hand injury could impact on any plans.

Carl Frampton became only the 20th Irish fighter to claim a legitimate world professional title . The new champion is believed to have damaged his hand mid-way through his 12-round points win over Martinez. Promotional issues are also believed to be a concern for Frampton and his backroom team. A move back to Sky TV may be a possibility after his four-fight deal with subscription channel BoxNation expired following the win over Martinez. Barry McGuigan negotiating a number of promotional issues ahead of Carl Frampton's first world-title defence . ‘We’re going to have a look at what’s available,’ said manager McGuigan, who insisted Team Frampton will put up a united front, despite the new champion’s eagerness to fight Quigg. ‘I think Carl takes his lead from me. Let’s be honest, I do what I think is right for him. He’s definitely done something to his hand so that’s going to keep him out for a period of time,’ continued McGuigan. ‘But I wanted him to get out again before Christmas. After a fight like that, when it looks like he cracked his hand, it might be better to let him sit out and rest.’ Frampton is keen on a showdown with British rival Quigg, but a fight with the Bury native is complicated due to the fact that he is promoted by Eddie Hearn's Matchroom, who previously promoted Frampton. Hearn also recently struck a promotional deal with mandatory title challenger Avalos, with Frampton commenting: ‘My mate Eddie Hearn has teamed up with him. He’s like an old girlfriend who won’t go away, I don't know what he's playing at.’ Quigg, who fights this Saturday against Belgian Stephane Jamoye live on Sky, has pushed for a fight with Frampton to take place in Manchester. Having built a temporary 16,000-seater stadium on the site of Belfast’s Titanic Quarter for Frampton’s fight with Martinez, however, McGuigan claimed he will look at a similarly ambitious promotional plan for the new champion’s future fights. ‘Oh God almighty, of course I’d do it again,’ said McGuigan on staging such an event. ‘It’s my job. And we want to produce. ‘Carl wants to fight him [Quigg], but it has to be on the right terms - we draw the crowd. He’ll box [Jamoye] next week, he’ll knock him out in a couple of rounds, and then he’ll start talking: “Oh now, I’m the one that’s most feared in the world” and all that rubbish. ‘So he alienates himself from us and makes it difficult. I end up thinking “I don’t want to do business with him”.’","Manager Barry McGuigan could open the door to a showdown between Carl Frampton and Scott Quigg .

"By . Ray Massey for the Daily Mail . Defiant: Boris Johnson continued to back his 'fantasy' scheme and attacked the civil servants who dismissed it from an official shortlist . Boris Johnson caused dismay in Tory ranks yesterday by pressing on with his island airport plan. Vowing to fight any expansion of Heathrow, the mayor of London said his Thames estuary vision was not dead despite it being ditched from an official shortlist. Sir Howard Davies, the airports commissioner, said the £100billion scheme was not a credible option because of the cost and risks involved. Three options remain on the table – two rival plans for a third runway at Heathrow, and one for a second runway at Gatwick. Mr Johnson said Sir Howard’s ‘myopic’ decision was ‘a giant smokescreen’ for a U-turn by civil servants who favour Heathrow expansion. And he demanded that David Cameron and George Osborne stick to a Conservative manifesto pledge to block a third runway in west London. He said: ‘We shouldn’t be contracting out this decision to distinguished former civil servants, no matter how eminent they are. This is a political decision. ‘Gatwick is not a long-term solution,’ he said, adding that Heathrow would ‘create unbelievable levels of noise, blight and pollution’. The Prime Minister will be spared an immediate row because Sir Howard’s final recommendation will not be announced until just after the general election in May 2015. It will now be at least 2025 before a third runway at Heathrow could be operational – allowing rival airports in Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Paris to steal a march. A further complication is that Mr Johnson, who is said to harbour prime ministerial ambitions, is seeking the safe Tory seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip. Opinion in the constituency, which borders Heathrow, is divided between those who depend on the airport for their livelihood and those worried about more noise. Responding to the mayor’s attack, Sir Howard said: ‘I wish I had his speechwriter. I am not sure that this kind of colourful prose takes us very much further forward. ‘We are not persuaded that a very large airport in the Thames estuary is the right answer to London’s and the UK’s connectivity needs. The economic disruption would be huge and there are environmental hurdles which it may prove impossible or very time consuming to surmount. Plans: One of the options is to build a second runway at Gatwick airport, pictured . ‘Even the least ambitious version of the scheme would cost £70billion to £90billion with much greater public expenditure involved than in other options – probably some £30billion to £60billion in total.’ The remaining Heathrow and Gatwick options were shortlisted by his commission last December. But Sir Howard, who is the former head of the Financial Services Commission, had wanted more time to decide whether the estuary plan should join them. Mary Creagh, Labour’s transport spokesman, said the decision ended the mayor’s ‘back-of-a-fag-packet’ scheme: ‘Boris Johnson’s fantasy island airport plan, which would have closed Heathrow and caused longer passenger journeys, has finally been dashed.’","Boris Johnson stood by his plan to build new airport in Thames Estuary .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Mia De Graaf for MailOnline . Britons think that milk, tea bags and e-books are good value for money while cinema food, petrol and train travel are a rip-off, according to a study. Consumers feel they only get their money's worth in four out of ten of their day-to-day purchases. The study into the average person's spending and the value of the £1 coin was commissioned by EE to mark the launch of the first £1 mobile phone tariff. Poor value? A quarter of Britons would not stop to pick up a pound coin in the street, a survey revealed . Twenty-four per cent of the 2,000 questioned said they would not stop to pick up a £1 coin in the street. Financial expert Andrew Hagger, who worked with EE on the campaign, revealed a sharp decline in the purchasing power of the pound over the last 30 years. He said: 'It won't come as a surprise to anybody that you now get so much less for a pound than you could 30 years ago, but it's really quite an eye opener to see the level of apathy that the British public have towards the humble pound coin. 'We've got to a stage where we simply don't expect a pound to buy us anything of real value, so it's refreshing to see an affordable pay as you go package now available to go some way to bucking this trend.' The study also found although nine in ten said they had shopped in a High Street pound shop in the past, nearly half said that they never expect to find anything of genuine value when doing so. A quarter of those polled believed that rising inflation has rendered the pound coin all but obsolete. An additional study conducted by Hagger revealed that in the year of its launch a pound coin was enough to buy three dozen eggs, a pint and a quarter of beer and two and a half litres of petrol. The good and the bad: Milk is still seen as good value but cinema food like popcorn isn't worth it, apparently . Today, however it would get you just three and a half eggs, a quarter of a pint of beer and three quarters of a litre of petrol. And that's led many a Brit to no longer see any real value in the pound coin believing that inflation has rendered it virtually obsolete, with one in seven of us happy to see it go out of circulation completely. Instead, common purchases like videogames, microwave meals and even the cost of a haircut are now seen as not representing value for money overall. A spokesman for EE, said yesterday: 'It's clear that current public perception is that there's little out there for people to enjoy for a pound, which has led us to introduce our new offering.' The top ten items rated as good value: 1 milk; 2 paracetamol; 3 tea bags; 4 fruit; 5 bread; 6 toilet rolls; 7 coffee; 8 clothing; 9 e-books; 10 laptops. The ten items rated as the worst value: 1 cinema food; 2 petrol; 3 train travel; 4 cinema tickets; 5 football tickets; 6 paying to use the lavatory at stations; 7 white wine in a pub; 8 gym membership; 9 car insurance; 10 satellite TV.","A quarter of Britons would not stop to pick up a £1 coin in the street .

In February this year, the former Radio 1 star was cleared of carrying out 12 sex attacks on young women after a six-week trial. The Crown Prosecution Service then announced that Travis would be retried over two allegations on which the jury had failed to agree. The first concerns an alleged assault  in 1990, and the second relates to an alleged attack  in 2008. The new charge relates to an alleged assault on a young woman in January 1995.

"By . Associated Press . Rep. Mark Sanford said Wednesday that claims made by his ex-wife Jenny in their contentious divorce, including that he gets drunk and does illegal and prescription drugs in front of their youngest son, are 'preposterous, crazy and wrong.' While the motion filed in a family court last week by attorneys for Jenny Sanford asked a judge to restrict both parents . from being under the influence of drugs or . excessive amounts of alcohol while caring for their son Blake, it stated that Mark Sanford's actions were the reason for the filing. Jenny Sanford also asked a judge to limit the . Congressman's visits with their teenage son and for the court . to require her former husband to undergo psychological tests and take . anger management and parenting courses. South Carolina Rep. Mark Sanford called his ex-wife's suggestion that he does drugs in front of their youngest son 'crazy.' Sanford is pictured here in April of last year at a campaign victory party with his fiancee and former mistress Maria Belen Chapur . 'Since the time of the divorce I have tried to do everything in my power to be both a good dad and a former husband. It seems that nothing I can do at this point is enough, appropriate or adequate,' he said. Sanford, then South Carolina governor, disappeared for five days in 2009 only to return from Argentina to acknowledge an affair with a woman to whom he is now engaged. Jenny Sanford sued for a divorce, which was granted in 2010. The couple has four sons, ranging in age from 15 to 22. Mark Sanford was elected last year to a congressional seat that he held for three terms in the 1990s before becoming governor. Mark Sanford arrives with his then-wife Jenny at a White House dinner in February of 2009 a few months before the then-governor admitted to being unfaithful to his wife . The court motion filed by Jenny Sanford last week also requested the couple be restrained from . making disparaging comments about each other in front of their son and exposing him to overnight visits from a member of the opposite sex 'who could reasonably be construed as a paramour.' 'Divorce has many different tragedies and in some cases, unfortunately, unrelenting bitterness seems to be one of them,' Mark Sanford said in response to his ex-wife's claims. 'I have avoided responding to these sorts of things as best I could over the past five years and I want to continue to do so. 'But when accusations are made that would suggest inadequacy in my role as a father or in adequacy in my professional role as a congressman, they have to be addressed,' he proclaimed. Sanford added: 'I think anybody who knows me in the Lowcountry knows that these accusations are false.' Sanford's district is along the lower South Carolina coast, also known as the Lowcountry. Jenny Sanford declined to comment on the recent court filings on Tuesday when contacted by the Associated Press. 'I have no comment on this private matter other than to say that the restraints and other relief requested are common or standard practices frequently requested to protect minor children in similar custody situations,' she said in a statement.","Jenny Sanford made the accusations in a court filing last week .

Air France One: To add to Mr Hollande's woes his plane was hit by lightning as he flew to Germany for a meeting with Angela Merkel . He witnessed rain of biblical proportions, his plane to Berlin was struck by lightning, and then, when he finally reached Germany to meet the country’s Chancellor Angela Merkel, he fluffed his lines on the red carpet. To top it all, there was even a whiff of scandal, as his appointment of Jean-Marc Ayrault, convicted of corruption in the 1990s, as prime minister was met with raised eyebrows. With France and much of Europe looking on at the newcomer, Mr Hollande’s day started well enough. He exchanged pleasantries with predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy at the Elysee Palace and, in a ceremony deliberately kept low key – to distinguish him from the outgoing ‘President Bling Bling’ – he was sworn in as the seventh president of the Fifth Republic. Raining on his parade: In weather that could have been orchestrated by his opponent Nicolas Sarkozy, the heavens opened on Mr Hollande's motorcade through Paris . Still chucking it down: Mr Hollande endured more outdoor ceremonies in the rain yesterday as he placed flowers at the monument to the Unknown soldier at the Arc de Triomphe .

But then it all went wrong. Perched through the sunroof of a small £25,000 hybrid Citroen DS5, and surrounded by guardsmen on horse-back, he was driven up the Champs Elysees waving to well-wishers. Unfortunately the heavens opened on Mr Hollande’s big moment. By the time he arrived at the Arc de Triomphe he resembled a business-like version of Jane Austen’s Darcy, emerging dripping wet from a dip in the lake.

In 2011, MailOnline introduced the public to the 'Hitler house', a building in Swansea that had an unfortunate resemblance to Hitler with a sweeping roof and thin, dark door underneath two windows. After this, MailOnline started receiving pictures of animals that looked like the dictator in droves. Tash the Cat, the pub mog from St Peter's Port in Guernsey was one of those animals. Named 'Tash' because of it's unfortunate smattering of facial hair, the cat also sports a dark black barnet, making her look more like the infamous German leader than a simple cat with a mustache. Patrons at the Salerie Inn also pointed out the distinction, making sure that the landlady, Annette Blows, knew it! Tash the cat, know to locals as Adolf Hitler, is the pub cat of the Salerie Inn in St Perter's Port in Guernsey .

"By . Pa Reporter . Lauren Winfield struck her maiden international half-century as England completed a 3-0 whitewash of South Africa in the women's NatWest T20 series with victory by eight runs at Edgbaston. The touring side threatened to claim their first ever win against England in the format, having reached 77 for one in the 14th over while chasing a target of 127, but they instead lost four wickets in 16 balls to finish on 118 for six. Winfield, 24, hit a powerful 74 from 60 balls in England's 126 for six after the early departure of captain Charlotte Edwards, whose unbeaten innings underpinned previous victories at Chelmsford and Northampton. Hitting out: Lauren Winfield takes a swing at a delivery on her way to a powerful 74 . Running it down:The England batsman plays the ball down to third man in the match-winning innings . From that setback in the third over, Winfield took responsibility as she raced past her previous best of 36, driving powerfully and smearing balls confidently through the leg side, including a six over mid-wicket off Chloe Tryon's first ball to add to nine fours. South Africa used seven bowlers in all and it was the wrist-spin of Dane van Niekerk, making her 38th international T20 appearance aged only 21, who brought order to proceedings during the middle stages. A big-turning leg-break beat Natalie Sciver and Trisha Chetty reacted smartly to complete the stumping, the wicketkeeper displaying the same athleticism later on when Heather Knight attempted to force a ball from left-armer Tryon slanting across her. South Africa had won the toss on a good pitch and the early wicket of Edwards to a leading edge after scores of 62 and 75 hitherto provided the start they wanted. Winfield responded by hitting Marizanne Kapp for three fours in a row, only for the highly-rated Sarah Taylor to drive to long off. Celebration: Jenny Gunn and Charlotte Edwards embrace after Gunn bowled an excellent final over . England were slightly off line with the new ball and Van Niekerk and Chetty put on 59 for the first wicket before confusion resulted in the run-out of Van Niekerk as Winfield held her nerve with time to throw. Nerves may have got to the South Africans after the loss of Lizelle Lee to the accurate medium pace of Jenny Gunn. Lydia Greenway and Sciver combined to run out Chetty and a brilliant overhead catch by Greenway at deep mid-wicket accounted for Mignon du Preez next ball. The quick hands of wicketkeeper Taylor ran out Kapp and stumped Bernadine Bezuidenhout as the required rate reached 10 per over before the experienced Gunn held her nerve to keep a full length with the last six balls. Thirteen runs were required from the final over, but Gunn's medium pace only allowed four singles. Trophy: Edwards poses with the cup after her side completed a 3-0 whitewash over South Africa . England captain Edwards said: 'South Africa bowled and fielded well, but our experience counted in the end. 'Jenny Gunn bowled a brilliant last over, and I am really pleased with the way Lauren Whitfield went out and played so well at the top of the order. The future looks bright for us and there is a big two years ahead.' Whitfield, speaking about her first international half-century, added: 'I have had a few starts so it was nice this time to go on and make an impact. 'It was quite a slow pitch and the loss of Lottie and Sarah Taylor early meant I had to bat further into the game myself. 'There is a lot of competition for places at the moment, so I am glad I was able to take my chance today.' Du Preez, the South Africa captain, said: 'We are heading in the right direction as a team, and the more experience we get playing against strong opposition the better we will get.'","Winfield makes maiden international half-century .

"By . Pa Reporter . A magnificent 164 by Ben Stokes led Durham to a Lords final, as they swept to an 83-run win in Saturday's Royal London Cup semi-final against Nottinghamshire at Chester-le-Street. The total of 353 for eight was 21 more than Durham had managed before in a one-day match, and Stokes broke his own record for the highest individual score - the 150 not out he made in a 40-over league match at Edgbaston in 2011. Nottinghamshire, who won the Yorkshire Bank 40 final at Lord's last season, quickly slipped to 21 for two in reply and were all out for 270, despite another sparkling century from one-day captain James Taylor. Smashing: Ben Stokes blasted 24 boundaries in his record-breaking innings for Durham . Centurion: Despite a difficult summer with the bat for England this was Stokes' second county hundred . Superb: The England all-rounder flays a shot through the covers during the sparkling innings . He followed his unbeaten 146 in the quarter-final win against Derbyshire by making 114 before he was last out in the 47th over. But Taylor was involved in two calamitous run-outs straight after he and Chris Read had taken 20 off the 39th over, bowled by Chris Rushworth. The 30-over scores were identical on 158 for three and in the next over Samit Patel reached 50 with a six off Gareth Breese. The ball was caught on the mid-wicket boundary by Calum MacLeod, but his foot had touched the rope. The stand with Taylor was worth 97, but Patel sat back to cut the next ball and edged to Phil Mustard. That proved crucial as the pressure to match Durham's late onslaught saw Riki Wessels drive Breese to long-on. Then James Franklin cracked a catch to extra cover before Read and Ajmal Shahzad were run out. After losing three of their first four games in the competition, Durham will now face Warwickshire on September 20 hoping for a repeat of their one previous appearance in a Lord's final, when they beat Hampshire in the 2007 Friends Provident Trophy. En route to that final they posted their previous best List A total - 332 for four - at home to Worcestershire. Hero: Stokes is congratulated by the Riverside crowd after his match-winning knock . Chopping on: Gareth Breese is bowled for a duck but the damage had been done by Stokes . Fightback: James Taylor led the Notts charge after early wickets with some inventive shot-making . Turning point: Samit Patel, who played well for his 52, is caught behind off the bowling of Breese . Stokes' 113-ball blitz on Saturday included six sixes. Dropped on 12 by Read, standing up to the medium pace of Steven Mullaney, his first 50 came off 47 balls, the second off 37 and the third off 21. He dominated a fourth-wicket stand of 135 with Mustard, although it was the wicketkeeper who launched the attack which started when they took the five-over batting powerplay after 35 overs. Mustard had not hit a boundary for 18 overs but suddenly smashed Jake Ball for four, six, four and Durham all but doubled their score in the last 15 overs, which produced 174 runs. Mustard was run out for 89 in the 40th, but by that stage Nottinghamshire did not know where to bowl at Stokes. Their three seamers - Ball, Luke Fletcher and Shahzad - conceded a total of 240 in 29 overs, while Mullaney was relatively frugal with 47 off 10. Early-morning rain cleared in time for play to begin promptly at 1030 and, under heavy cloud, Nottinghamshire chose to field. Hitting out: Taylor continued his superb form with a very good century but it wasn't enough . All round performance: It was fitting that Stokes took the final wicket to win the match with the ball . Mark Stoneman launched Durham's innings with 36 off 29 balls before Fletcher, who had conceded 23 in three overs, switched ends and swung one in to bowl Stoneman off his pads with the score on 61 in the 10th. Stokes went in at 92 for three in the 15th over and scored 70 of the next 87 runs. There was a touch of finesse about an early leg glance, but he was soon striking the ball with brutal power off the back foot through the off side. Mullaney and Patel kept things reasonably tight until Stokes drove the left-arm spinner to the extra-cover boundary then launched him over long-on for six. That was the only maximum in his 84-ball hundred, but five more followed before he fell to the last ball of the 49th over, driving Shahzad to long-on. In the fourth over of the reply Michael Lumb edged John Hastings to Mustard, then Rushworth nipped one back to bowl Mullaney. Sam Wood, sent in at three, made 22 off 33 balls before he fell lbw trying to sweep in Breese's first over. The off-spinner finished with three for 53 and will fulfil his wish to end his 11-year Durham career at Lord's.","England stars dominate as Durham win by 83 runs .

"Almost £6,000 worth of Viagra and other medical supplies were among items worth more than £7million to be stolen from the Ministry of Defence since 2007. The anti-impotence pills were among medical stocks swiped from RAF Marham in Norfolk, while across the country bayonets, ammunition and even equipment from nuclear submarines have been taken. A replica AK-47 assault rifle also vanished from a military base, before it was later returned, and thieves also managed to smuggle large items including an aircraft fuselage, a Bedford Truck and a washing machine out of MoD sites. Taken: Almost £6,000 worth of Viagra and other medical supplies were among items worth more than £7million to be stolen from the Ministry of Defence since 2007 . Site: The Viagra was taken from RAF Marham in Norfolk. The MoD said that the anti-impotency drug could also be used to treat low blood pressure and altitude sickness . Thousands of rounds of live and blank ammunition and 100 bayonets were also taken, along with magazines and gun parts, according to The Times. Despite being more commonly associated with sexual impotence, Viagra has other medical uses, as an MoD spokesman pointed out. 'For example it is often used to treat low blood pressure and altitude sickness,' the spokesman told The Times. Nearly £7million worth of equipment . has been stolen from the MoD since 2007 - figures revealed in response . to a parliamentary question posed by Tory MP Nick de Bois. Missing: Across the country bayonets, ammunition and even equipment from nuclear submarines have been taken from MoD sites (file photo) The . MP for Enfield North asked what the value of equipment taken from the . department was, and was told by Defence minister Andrew Murrison that . £6,628,057 worth was suspected as having been stolen between April 2007 . and January 15 this year. 'These . figures do not take into account the value of items subsequently . recovered or that investigations may have established later that the . temporary loss of an item was not the result of fraud or theft,' he . added. 'We are vigorous in . seeking to recover items suspected as stolen and have so far . successfully recovered items to the value of around £600,000. We have . also achieved improvements in detection and reporting in recent years.' Revealing: The worth of equipment stolen from the MoD since 2007 was revealed in response to a parliamentary question posed by Tory MP Nick de Bois . Dr Murrison also said that a new . counter fraud and loss department was set up by the MoD last year in . order to minimise the losses from the Defence budget through fraud, misappropriation and theft - freeing up more money to be spent on the Armed Forces. Military . budgets and troop numbers have been subject to cuts in order to plug a . multi-billion pound blackhole in the defence budget. The Army is being cut from 102,000 to 82,000 over a number of years, with the 20,000 posts expected to be gone by 2020. Navy numbers are expected to fall by 6,000, while the RAF will lose 5,000 staff. The release of the the value of items stolen came after Sergeant Major Steven Barratt was jailed for 20 months after he tried to sell £115,000 worth of Army night vision equipment via eBay. In October 2012 40 anti-tank mines were taken from a goods train carrying explosives as it came to a stop for a red light near Warrington. Officials only noticed that the  mines were missing the following day when the train arrived in Didcot, Oxfordshire.

A dozen hand grenades, 100 bayonets, 600 magazine assemblies for the SA80 assault rifle, 470 items of clothing and footwear and 781 towels all vanished - as did DVD players, televisions and stereos.

An MoD spokesman told MailOnline: 'The security of our personnel and assets remains of paramount importance and the MOD works hard to detect and deter theft. 'There are robust processes in place to raise awareness of the need for vigilance in all aspects of security, but just as theft occurs in wider society, the MOD is not immune and we actively encourage individuals to report any evidence of loss or suspicion or theft.

"By . John Greechan . There is always another saviour just around the corner. A serious player with serious money, seriously promising great things. An answer to the prayers of supporters. Anyone willing to heed the multiple warnings from recent history, though, will know that a club in financial trouble is often prey to the worst kind of opportunist. And that many a potential white knight turns out to be anything but a source of stability. The pattern is now well established. A club with a great history but pressing problems gets into trouble, is sold on or snapped up out of insolvency by one fast-talking ‘character’, then punted to someone a bit more low-rent, before eventually winding up owned by … well, let’s not go there. Rangers have endured serious financial difficulties over the last decade, causing them to be relegated . Think of Leeds United. From Ken Bates to the impressive-sounding Gulf Finance House, then on to current owner Massimo Cellino. At least assuming the Italian doesn’t lose an impending court case, forcing him to sell on to AN Other. Think, too, of Portsmouth. Now a beacon of hope, owned and run by supporters, they were passed through the hands of umpteen questionable characters before being saved by the fans. Pompey Supporters Trust have actually engaged with their counterparts at Rangers regularly in a bid to provide help — if only by example — on the subject of a fans’ takeover, something that has failed to gain much traction around Ibrox. Trust chairman Ashley Brown, who also serves as a director on board, understands that it’s a huge leap for any set of supporters to make. Until, that is, things get truly desperate. Detailing the litany of disasters that befell his team before the community rallied, Brown told Sportsmail: ‘Our ownership tale is like a work of fiction, almost. Rangers even had Lithuanian owners who now face an extradition order in connection with bank fraud . ‘We even had an owner that no one has been able to prove actually existed, although the belief is that he’s a low-level accountant working somewhere in the Middle East and his name was used by others. ‘More recently we had Lithuanian owners who are now under an extradition order in connection with hundreds of billions of dollars in fraud from Lithuanian banks. ‘The people we had to fight off at the very last moment, led by Keith Harris, included a guy whose father was subsequently assassinated — and he had to go into hiding himself. ‘There are countless examples of people who did own the club, or who we had to fight off, who came under all sorts of weird and wonderful categories. There were proven mafia connections in one case. Unbelievable. ‘I hope it doesn’t get as bad as it did for us — for any club in the country. But, if there is a key message I would give to Rangers fans, it is that it’s quite amazing how much power you can have if you work together. ‘We’ve spoken to people from the Rangers Supporters Trust. They’ve been keen to hear what we did and how we did it. ‘The biggest problem football fans in general have is that fans don’t tend to rally all in the same direction — until things are in such a tremendously dire strait.’ Some Rangers fans may still be waiting for Dave King, a potential saviour who told fans not to buy tickets . Many Rangers supporters may still be waiting for Dave King, one of the potential saviours who urged fans not to buy season tickets, dangling the carrot of increased fan involvement when — not if — he swept to power. Until then, do supporters merely hope that one of the board-approved investment avenues being explored — an overseas backer here, a shares issue there — is enough to put everything back on an even keel? ‘It is natural for fans just to jump at someone coming in offering to pour money in,’ said Brown. ‘We know full well that there are plenty of fans out there who don’t care about the accounts and the bottom line. ‘They want a £5million striker — it doesn’t matter if the company is £150m in debt, as long as he’s scoring goals. There are a lot of fans who are happy to bury their heads in the sand until it’s too late. ‘Often you find that supporters who try to point out the reality of the situation are the ones accused of scaremongering — told to keep quiet and support their team. Until it’s too late. If Rangers fans united, like Portsmouth supporters did, they might not have to rely on outside saviours . ‘You have to remember one thing on any ownership, foreign or domestic. The idea of a Jack Walker, who says: “You know what, I’ve got quite a large bank account, I’m going to give a few million to my favourite football club because I love it so much”, that is incredibly rare. ‘Even the ones with money come in and effectively lend the club money — often at high interest rates. That’s something that we found, that the club was paying back loans way above commercial interest rates. ‘We had a series of poor owners, so the will to do something built up over the years. ‘We were also helped by the club being in administration. The last time it fell into administration for quite a long period, almost 18 months. That gave us a chance to do something . ‘Often administrations are much shorter. The club is liquidated or yet another undesirable owner will come in, wave a few million pounds and take the club away again.’ If that sounds familiar, the current scenario at Elland Road will certainly ring a bell at Ibrox, Leeds United Supporters Club spokesman David Gaertner telling Sportsmail: ‘We’ve been through a few takeovers now. Ken Bates, then the Emirates lot, now Mr Cellino — who I do think has the best interest of the club at heart, even if he’s upset some people. ‘When these guys come around making the promises, it is easy for some supporters to grab at the hope.’","Rangers has been owned by numerous suspect parties in recent times .

"By . Tom Worden for MailOnline . The chief of police in Magaluf has been arrested after British bar owners made allegations of extortion, corruption and drug dealing in the scandal-hit resort. Jose Antonio Navarro was detained amid claims officers demanded money from bar owners and tipped them off about police raids. Carnage Magaluf - which hit the headlines when an 18-year-old British girl was caught on video performing sex acts on 24 men - is one of the businesses reported to have made a complaint. Following a summer of scandal, the chief of police of Magaluf has been arrested amid claims of corruption . Two other officers, who have not been named, were also arrested over allegations that have shocked the resort on the Spanish island of Majorca. Chief Inspector Navarro was held by the Civil Guard in the early hours of Monday morning and was remanded in custody by investigating magistrate Carmen Gonzalez. His arrest came after several businessmen made a formal complaint to anti-corruption prosecutors last Friday. Officers allegedly turned a blind eye to crimes by rival businesses and tipped them off in advance of police drugs raids. Local newspaper Diario de Mallorca said the allegations included 'extortion, favouritism to certain bars and drug trafficking.' Navarro appeared at a behind-closed-doors hearing yesterday. Prosecutors are studying a video and emails provided by the bar owners making the allegations. The resort came in for criticism this summer after a video emerged of a girl performing sex acts on 24 men . Local newspapers said officers are also alleged to have planted drugs in bars. A spokesman for the Civil Guard confirmed Mr Navarro had been arrested on the instruction of the judge. The spokesman said: 'The judge instructed our officers to carry out the arrest. The judge is leading the investigation and there is a secrecy order preventing us saying any more.' Magaluf has a reputation for attracting British youngsters looking for sex and cheap alcohol. The resort hit the headlines this summer when an 18-year-old British girl was videoed performing sex acts on 24 men in a bar, while on a pub crawl organised by Carnage Magaluf. This week another 18-year-old girl let 15 strangers lick cream from her breasts as part of her 18th birthday celebrations. Spanish authorities have tried to clamp down on outrageous drunken behaviour in Magaluf this summer. They have introduced new regulations for pub crawls, have ordered bars to close and imposed massive fines. The allegations of corruption against local police are said to have come from bar owners in the resort .","The chief of police in the scandal-hit resort was held by the Civil Guard .

"By . Associated Press . Starbucks has apologized to a 24-year-old woman who said she wasn't allowed in a Rochester-area store because she had a service dog. Amy Kaplan of suburban Brighton said she was denied service after entering a Starbucks on Sunday afternoon with her service dog, a malamute named Zero. Kaplan suffered a traumatic brain injury in a traffic accident, and the dog helps her cope with memory issues and anxiety . Scroll Down for Video . Friendship and support: Amy Kaplan and Zero the malamute were turned away from their Rochester, New York . Kaplan posted a video to YouTube of her experience at the Twelve Corners Starbucks in New York where server, Bill Kuhns, tells her to she has to leave. Asking him why she has to leave with Zero, Kaplan says, 'Are you denying me access because of my service dog?' Kuhns replies, 'No, I'm not. I'm tellin you that you cannot come in with your service dog.' Kaplan told the Democrat and Chronicle that she stepped into the coffee store around 3pm on Sunday with Zero, who she needs after suffering a traumatic brain injury after a crash that occurred between a bus and the ambulance she was in working as a paramedic. Zero is trained to help Kaplan with memory issues which resulted after her head injury which left her unable to remember where she has parked her car or where she lives. Refusal: This is the moment that Bill Kuhns refused to let Amy Kaplan and Zero (left) into the Rochester Starbucks . Legally, the Americans with Disabilities Act requires all businesses to allow service animals inside. However, the business is allowed to ask why the animal is needed, but owners do not need to produce written proof they need it. The Starbucks employee objected to Kaplan's service animal because he thought she did not need it and because she had no documentation. Kaplan said this is a common problem. 'This is a part of daily life when you're a service dog handler,' Kaplan said to the Democrat and Chronicle. 'Everywhere you go, nobody wants to let me in.' When informed of the incident, Sumi Ghosh, who is a regional vice president for Starbucks attempted to phone Kaplan to apaologize. He sent an email in which he wrote, 'I want to personally apologize to you about what happened. 'It is not consistent with our standards and policies and your experience was clearly not what we would have wanted for you.'","The coffee giant has now apologized to Amy Kaplan, 24, for refusing entry to Rochester, New York store ."
"By . Chris Foy for the Daily Mail . Follow @@FoyChris . Eurovision came to Oxford yesterday — not the daft costumes and dubious singing, but the embarrassment of ‘nil points’ for London Welsh, on their Aviva Premiership return. This was a chastening occasion for the promoted Exiles and for the competition as a whole. The numbers added up to a low-key mismatch, as Exeter rattled along to their first half-century in the top division, in front of a meagre crowd of just 2,776 spectators, despite new-season optimism and blue skies over the Kassam Stadium. The Premiership rightly prides itself on the abundance of close contests it produces, but this was a procession from the 11th minute, when Rob Baxter’s Chiefs struck for the first of their seven tries. By failing to trouble the scorers at their own ground, Welsh suffered the same indignity as Newcastle on the opening weekend last season, when Bath left Kingston Park with 21 unanswered points. Debut to remember: Thomas Waldrom celebrates his first try in Exeter Chiefs colours . Two years ago, the Exiles marked their arrival among the elite with a respectable 38-13 defeat at home to Leicester, followed by a 40-3 thrashing against Harlequins in London. But they followed those initial setbacks with a 25-24 victory in this fixture — a world away from yesterday’s outcome. Not even the presence of a World Cup-winning All Black in their ranks, scrum half Piri Weepu (below), could stem the tide. Justin Burnell, who strove to prepare Welsh for the struggle against relegation this season by recruiting 25 new players over the summer, must hope the acclimatisation process is mercifully brief. Powerful: Waldrom clatters into London Welsh' Piri Weepu with a thunderous tackle . After this drubbing, he said: ‘We have to learn from this.There are 10 months of the season to go and we knew what we were getting into. We can either go home and hide away or we can stick our chests out, get the smile back on our faces, get back into training and keep working hard. We’re at Bath next so it doesn’t get easier.’ Reflecting on his side’s defeat, Burnell added: ‘We squandered opportunities by spilling the ball and Exeter were quick to capitalise on our turn-overs. When people make individual errors, it is not about a lack of cohesion or the new signings. We have to make our tackles, make the final pass and hold on to it.’ End in sight: Ian Whitten races clear to score a try for the Exeter Chiefs against London Welsh . While Welsh were easy prey, Exeter were convincing as they went through their high-octane attacking repertoire. Fly half Gareth Steenson under-pinned their performance with seven kicks from as many attempts — not to mention some nifty footwork and distribution — but this was a collective demonstration of slick running and inter-play. New signing Thomas Waldrom, the former England No 8, began the procession by scoring his side’s first two tries on his competitive debut. First, his off-load sent Haydn Thomas darting clear in midfield and after Steenson maintained the momentum, his pass released Waldrom in the 22 and he blasted over the line. His second try came in the 27th minute, after Tim Molenaar had held Steenson up over the line on the left. It was 17-0 at the break, but the dam burst in the second half. Dave Ewers capped a fine display from blindside flanker by rumbling in for the Chiefs’ third try, then centre Sam Hill slalomed clear to strike. Way ahead: Jack Arnott gets himself way ahead of the opposition players to score . Get in there: Arnott celebrates his first-half try for the Exeter Chiefs . On the move: Exeter Chiefs' Chrysander Botha races clear to score a try against London Welsh . Celebrations:  Botha scores a try during the game at the Kassam Stadium . Dejected: London Welsh drudge off the field disappointed after their opening game thrashing . On the hour, from a short-range lineout on the left, Ian Whitten burst forward and bounced off two tackles to touch down. Seconds later Jack Arnott claimed a clearance and spun out of a tackle to run to the posts, before full back Chrysander Botha rounded off the rout by storming through heavy traffic and swerving to finish. For Welsh, this represented a grim early glimpse of the struggle they face in the months ahead, but for Exeter it was an encouraging indication they have the firepower and daring intent to emerge as top-half contenders this season. ‘The conditioners have got our guys in great nick during the summer and we were able to impose our game,’ said coach Ali Hepher. ‘There were times in the first half when we could have been more ruthless but it was pleasing to get a bonus-point win in the first game of the season.’","Exeter Chiefs thrash London Welsh at the Kassam Stadium .

"By . Simon Caldwell For The Daily Mail . A Dutch euthanasia doctor killed a woman in her 80s because she did not want to live in a nursing home. The death has prompted regulators to refer the case to prosecutors for the first time since euthanasia was legalised in the Netherlands 12 years ago. The unidentified woman died by lethal injection in the Levenseindekliniek – or Life End Clinic – after she complained she did not want to spend the rest of her life in a care home. The doctor administered a lethal injection to the woman in 80s who had complained she did not want to spend the rest of her life in a care home after she was partially paralysed by a stroke (picture posed by models) A doctor concluded the unhappiness of the woman, who had been partially paralysed by a stroke, constituted ‘unbearable suffering’ – the legal requirement for euthanasia. But the regional review committee, which polices euthanasia, found the doctor was negligent and referred the case to the Public Prosecution Service, which will decide whether a crime has been committed. It comes months after Professor Theo Boer, a member of a review committee, warned UK politicians not to legalise assisted suicide because the Dutch experiment had been a disaster. The Life End Clinic was established in the Hague in 2012 to provide euthanasia to patients whose family doctors object to it. It has helped about 250 patients to die in the past two years and also has mobile doctors to administer lethal drugs in people’s homes. According to the Dutch newspaper Trouw, regulators acted after the doctor who killed the woman based the decision to end her life ‘solely on the fact that the patient was in a nursing home’. The Life End Clinic was established in the Hague in 2012 to provide euthanasia to patients . Twenty years earlier the woman had put in writing her desire not to live in a such a home if she became incapacitated. She expressed this wish verbally to her doctor 18 months ago and soon afterwards was left unable to communicate properly by a stroke. A family member contacted the euthanasia clinic when he formed the impression that the woman had begun to complain. An independent doctor who visited her reported that she said only two words – ‘kan niet [can not]’ – and that she held her head in her hands. According to a report by the regulators, this was regarded by the doctor as sufficient evidence of ‘despair and unhappiness’ to constitute unbearable suffering. But nursing home staff reported that the elderly woman was very often content, friendly and quiet. The case represents the second time in four months that regulators have criticised the clinic. In April officials said a doctor had not conducted sufficient interviews with a woman with psychiatric problems before helping her to die. A week before peers debated proposals by Lord Falconer to legalise assisted suicide in the UK, Professor Boer – who has reviewed around 4,000 lethal injection deaths – warned: ‘Don’t go there.’ Once an advocate of euthanasia, he said he now thought the Dutch were ‘terribly wrong’ to think they could control it. The professor said his country had seen an ‘explosive increase’ in euthanasia deaths since 2007 and he expected the number to hit a record 6,000 this year. He was also gravely concerned at the extension of killing to new groups, including the depressed. Campaigners Dignity in Dying said the Assisted Dying Bill, due to reach the committee stage in the Lords in November, is based on a model that ‘has never been extended beyond the criteria of terminal illness’. But Paralympian Tanni Grey-Thompson said the killing of the care home resident showed safeguards ‘do not work’. Lord Carlile of Berriew, who investigated euthanasia for a parliamentary inquiry, said: ‘The Dutch experiment shows that [the law] will be abused, that policing such abuse is extremely difficult and, of course, it is always too late.’","Unidentified woman died by lethal injection at the Life End Clinic after stroke .

"By . Julian Robinson for MailOnline . An 'internet Del Boy' who became an online trading millionaire has been jailed for a £300,000 tax swindle. John Woolfenden, 52, made a fortune selling CDs, DVDs and console games on websites such as Play.com and eBay. However, Woolfenden, from Radcliffe, Greater Manchester, who traded under the name 'Globalworldentertainments', had failed to pay tax or VAT on at least £300,000 of his earnings. John Woolfenden (left), 52, made a fortune selling CDs, DVDs and console games on websites such as Play.com and eBay and used his home as a base for the trading (pictured right) The fraud, including unpaid taxes, interest and money laundering totalling £299,753.17, was unearthed as part a crackdown on online tax evasion by HMRC inspectors. When officers raided his home in May last year they found it set up as a base for online trading, with DVDs, CDs and games stored all over the property, including in the shower. During the fraud Woolfenden had more than 500,000 listings on eBay and accountants discovered that nearly £1.4million had passed through his online bank accounts over six years. Woolfenden made no mention of his online trading income on his Self Assessment tax returns and, when challenged by HMRC for details of the trade, ignored the requests and did not respond to letters . Woolfenden is also said to have routed other payments through an American bank account in an attempt to disguise his income and launder his profits. He made no mention of his online trading income on his Self Assessment tax returns and, when challenged by HMRC for details of the trade, he ignored the requests and did not respond to letters. He pleaded guilty to three charges of evading tax, VAT and money laundering at a hearing in June and has now been jailed for two years by a judge at Bolton Crown Court. Speaking after the hearing, Sandra Smith, Assistant Director, Criminal Investigation, HMRC, said the trader's online earnings should have been declared . When officers raided his home in May last year they found it set up as a base for online trading, with DVDs, CDs and games stored all over the property (left), including in the shower (right) She said: 'Woolfenden did not declare his true income on his Self Assessment tax returns; he did not register for VAT, or pay VAT owed for his commercial trading online. 'He stole a substantial sum of money purely to line his own pockets. 'HMRC will pursue every avenue to ensure evaded taxes are restored to the taxpayer and public finances.' Tax inspectors launched a campaign to target the earnings of online traders in 2012, and are continuing to use data to pursue prosecutions against potential tax evaders.","John Woolfenden made fortune by trading CDs, DVDs and games online .

"By . Derek Lawrenson for the Daily Mail . Henrik Stenson was flying back from Atlanta to his home in Orlando last year when he couldn’t help but reflect that his life had turned a sweet full circle. Safely tucked away was the $11.4million (£7m) he had just claimed for winning the Tour Championship and the FedEx Cup. Some 35,000ft below was the prison believed to be housing the notorious fraudster Allen Stanford, the man who swindled Stenson out of a similar sum in 2009. ‘Life has a funny way of setting things right,’ said the personable Swede. ‘I was more than $11 million richer and here we were, flying over the federal prison in Florida where he is very possibly serving his sentence. There was some satisfaction in that, although I couldn’t help but think of the people who lost a tremendous amount of money who weren’t fortunate enough to earn it back.’ Fortune: After victories in the Tour Championship and FedEx Cup, Henrik Stenson earned £7m . It has taken Stenson a long time to speak openly about that bleak period but he has come to terms with it now. ‘It’s safe to say I won’t be visiting him in prison,’ he said. ‘What I might do to him if I saw him face to face might get me arrested as well. I lost millions in a Ponzi scheme and, while I didn’t have all my eggs in his basket, it hurt.’ Was it a coincidence that Stenson fell off the charts in the years that followed? Some of those close to him, like his English coach Pete Cowen, understandably believe there to be a link but Stenson himself won’t use it as an excuse. ‘It affected me but I got over it emotionally faster than people think,’ he told US magazine Golf Digest. ‘I knew investing carries risk and as a professional golfer I’m used to taking risks. A pro golf career is basically a gamble, at least starting out. ‘Of course I assumed there was only normal risk, when in truth I was destined to lose the whole investment. But it all fell under the category of risk, so I tried to accept it and move on.’ Loss: in 2009, Stenson lost a vast sum of money to fraudster Allen Stanford, who is now in jail . He has now done so to such an extent that he enjoyed something of a Rory McIlroy-style summer last year, flattening everyone to top the money lists on both sides of the Atlantic and help himself to the tidy sum of on-course earnings of $21m. He was also the first player to tie up his place in Europe’s Ryder Cup team — fully eight months before the end of automatic qualifying. In three weeks, he will play in his third Ryder Cup but first for six years. ‘It has been strange knowing for so long I had made it, but now the team has been finalised it is time to put the Ryder Cup game face on,’ he said. ‘I suppose it was inevitable there would be a reaction this year after what happened last summer, but I haven’t played badly. I’m still in the world’s top three and feel like my best golf is not far away, so I’m really looking forward to it. I’ve missed it.’ Sympathy: Stenson said he is happy with his success, but feels for those unable to replace their lost wealth . Stenson might be the only player in world golf who has managed to fight back from not one horrendous slump but two. The first came in 2001, when his driving was so bad he would regularly miss fairways by 70 yards. Both times he fell outside the world’s top 200 and both times he bounced back into the top five. The fearless 38-year-old will undoubtedly be one of captain Paul McGinley’s key men, both on the course with his ferocious hitting and keeping everyone relaxed off it with his dry sense of humour and penchant for practical jokes. You could easily see him playing the role of patriarch to a rookie like Victor Dubuisson or equally, forming a formidable all-Scandinavian partnership with Thomas Bjorn. First things first, though, and Stenson is in need of a top-four finish here at the BMW Championship to make the top 30 who will contest his two titles, the Tour Championship and the FedEx finale, in Atlanta next week. He made a good start, completing a first round 68 yesterday, as one of nine players who were unable to finish on Thursday. Playing partner Graeme McDowell could only manage a 73. Joint leaders after first round 67s were Rory McIlroy, Jordan Spieth and Gary Woodland. As for the other European Ryder Cuppers, Sergio Garcia and Martin Kaymer shot 68s while Justin Rose shot 69.","Henrik Stenson won Tour Championship and FedEx Cup .

"By . Katy Winter for MailOnline . As well as proving that we will wear pretty much anything in the name of fashion - including what can only described as an adult baby-gro  - the onesie kickstarted a trend for ironic, playful fashion. Celebrities such as Cara Delevingne and Harry Styles couldn't get enough of them and fuelled huge demand from the public. However, according to the high street, the comic all-in-one has had its day. Step away from the onesie: Celebrities such as Katy Perry (left) and Harry Styles (right) helped fuel the trend . Stores like M&S are set to offer a wide range of Christmas knitwear this season to supply the growing demand . Yes, it's time to shrug off that one-piece, this year is all about the continuing comeback of novelty knitwear - the weirder and wackier the better. From outlandish frosty the snowman designs to a Rudolph with a battery-powered flashing nose, it's no longer unusual to see grown men and women walking around in eye-catching festive fare, spurred on in part by charity drives such as sponsored ‘Christmas Jumper at work’ days. And the trend looks set to continue to rise, with Sainsbury’s, who sold a Christmas jumper every 22 seconds last year ordering five times more stock this year in preparation. Speaking to MailOnline Marie Jones, Head of Design M&S Collection comments: 'Christmas jumpers sold out last year as soon as they hit stores and with the fantastic breath of offer for this festive season no doubt they will be best sellers.' Model Cara Delevingne was a well known onesie lover, favouring the more outlandish designs . Worn by the likes of Justin Bieber, the onesie looks to be usurped from the top spot by novelty knitwear . But if you thought that however garish a knitted hat or jumper, it can't be as bad as elephant, tiger and bunny onesies, think again. Novelty twosies - or matching top and bottom tracksuits - are also predicted to be a hit. Speaking to the Guardian, James Brown of Sainsbury's says: 'We don't really see a growth this year in onesies. It will more about the two-piece and outfits that match head-to-toe.' Creating the same effect as the onesie but with the added advantage of making it a bit easier to go to the toilet, it seems we may soon see entire families kitted out in matching knitwear. Speaking to the Guardian, a spokesperson from Asda, who have increased their ordering of festive knits by 62 per cent from last year says: 'We are going after the whole family: mum, dad, the kids and the dog.'","Phenomenal onesie trend seems to be cooling off .

"By . Pa Reporter . Australian Mark Renshaw beat Team Sky's Ben Swift in a sprint finish to stage two of the Tour of Britain in Llandudno. Renshaw, more used to working as Mark Cavendish's lead-out man within the Omega Pharma-Quick Step squad, jumped clear before the line to win comfortably as Swift paid the price for going too soon. After the climb of the Great Orme created significant splits in the peloton, Movistar's Alex Dowsett tried to break away to victory - challenged by Sylvain Chavanel (IAM Cycling) - but Sir Bradley Wiggins, working for Swift, led a group of chasers back on to their wheel on the approach to the line. Look, no hands! Mark Renshaw celebrates his win during stage two of the 2014 Tour of Britain . Dash to the line: Renshaw was handed the yellow journey after coming out on top in a sprint finish . Swift then sprang forward but, with Cavendish not in contention, Renshaw covered the move and claimed the win. 'It was a great stage, a great victory, my first for the year with Omega Pharm-Quick Step,' Renshaw said on British Eurosport. 'It's always good to win, I've had victories here before on the Tour of Britain and it's good to do it again.' The 31-year-old, winner of stage five of the Tour of Britain in 2011, will now take yellow from Marcel Kittel, who lost touch with the peloton on the Great Orme. 'It's great to be in yellow, it's a bonus,' he added. 'We came here to work for Cav but he had a really bad crash yesterday and is just trying to recover at the moment so he gave me a chance today and it's a really good victory.' The 200.8km run from Knowsley Safari Park began with an early break of some 40 riders failing to gain any separation before a more select group - made up of Ian Bibby (Madison Genesis), Christopher Lawless (GBR), Lasse Hansen (Garmin-Sharp), Rob Partridge (Giordana) and Pablo Lastras (Movistar), soon joined by King of the Mountains leader Mark McNally (An Post Chain Reaction) - edged clear. Second best: Team Sky's Ben swift was beaten into a podium finish at stage two . Vicious cycle: Stage one winner Marcel Kittel lost the yellow journey after separating from the peloton . Their lead reached four minutes before the peloton began to reel them back in, and the last remnants were picked up on the Great Orme. Dowsett tried to break off the front with two kilometres to go and led the way onto the final straight with Chavanel on his wheel, but the pack were closing in to set up the sprint finish. Before the day's racing began, Sky lost Ian Stannard who withdrew with a fractured scaphoid suffered in a crash close to Sunday's finish in Liverpool.","Mark Renshaw claimed the second stage in the Tour of Britain .

"By . Derek Lawrenson for MailOnline . Sergio Garcia leads at the halfway stage after a thrilling second round of the BMW Championship but worryingly for the revitalised Spaniard a familiar deadly foe has appeared in his rear view mirror. Rory McIlroy was well off the pace but a marvellous finish of three birdies in his last four holes for a second successive 67 has left him just two shots behind. Rory and Sergio has been a recurring theme this summer, of course, with the outcome to this point always the same. During the first two legs of his unforgettable treble, McIlroy defeated Garcia to claim the Open Championship at Hoylake and then the Bridgestone Invitational at Firestone. Behind you: Leader Sergio Garcia has Rory McIlroy in the chasing pack . Now the pair could be set for another fabulous shootout this weekend. Not that the pair have things all their own way. Sandwiched between them is American Ryan Palmer who shot a wonderful 64 of his own, while another home player Billy Horschel is tied with McIlroy for third place. These two have a bit of history themselves, since they fell out during the 2007 Walker Cup when McIlroy took exception to the extrovert Horschel during just a bit too much whoopin’ and hollerin’. Happily, they have since made their peace. If he can’t win this title himself for the second time in three years, McIlroy would probably be the first to hope Garcia gets over the line. His brilliant form this summer is certainly deserving of a victory and you can see him being an absolute star once more at the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles. Driver: Sergio Garcia hits his tee shot on the 12th hole in Colorado. What a joy it was to watch him dismantle this storied old layout at Cherry Hills with a consummate demonstration of craft and imagination for a six under par round of 64. Even when he played the odd bad shot – his second to the par five 17th finished in the water – he saved par with a majestic pitch that finished just inches from the hole. He had some deserved good fortune as well, most notably at the par four seventh where his second shot from 128 yards finished in the hole for an eagle two. The 34 year old also had four birdies. ‘It’s just been one of those summers where I’ve had some good breaks and holed shots like that one, so it has been great,’ said Garcia. ‘Obviously it would be wonderful to win a title as prestigious as this but there’s still so much golf to play before I can think about that. I’m looking forward to the challenge, though. Contending for titles is where you want to be.’ Charge: McIlroy finished with three birdies in his last four holes . McIlroy drove the 346 yard par four opening hole and birdied the third but thereafter his round appeared to be drifting nowhere. At the 10th he flew the green from 127 yards and gave his caddie JP Fitzgerald a thunderous look. All was forgiven over a closing stretch that was the exact opposite of his opening round, when he had registered a couple of sloppy late bogeys. How often during this sublime summer for the 25 year old have we seen him respond to events on the leaderboard, and close the gap just when he needed? It began when he rolled in a 30ft putt at the par three 15th and continued with an even longer effort at the 16th. At the par five 17th he took full advantage of his extraordinary length to find the green in two and two putted. ‘I’m a lot happier with this 67 than I was after yesterday’s,’ said McIlroy. ‘It meant a lot to finish so strongly and it has left me in a very good position.’ Tied fifth is Masters champion Bubba Watson while Rickie Fowler, another of the boys of this summer, is only five behind. Alongside him are three more sharp shooters who could certainly make a run at the lead this weekend – former world number one Adam Scott, American Jordan Spieth, and Swede Henrik Stenson. US Open Champion Martin Kaymer is six off the pace on two under with Justin Rose on level par after a 71.","Sergio Garcia leads at the halfway stage on eight-under-par .

The development comes a day after the Pegulas were among at least three prospective ownership groups to submit binding bids to purchase the team. The other two groups to submit bids were New York City real estate mogul Donald Trump and a Toronto group fronted by rocker Jon Bon Jovi. The Pegulas have been regarded as front-runners to buy the Bills since first expressing interest in May. They have made Buffalo their adopted home after buying the Sabres in 2011. They have a net worth of more than $3.5billion and the support of local business leaders and public officials because of their commitment to keep the Bills in Western New York. Missing out: Donald Trump had expressed an interest in buying the team . Game over: Rock star Jon Bon Jovi appears to have admitted defeated in his bid to snap up the Bills . Once identified as the prospective ownership candidates, the Pegulas would require approval from members of the NFL Finance Committee, which is to meet next week. They would also have to go through an extensive background check by an NFL-contracted security firm. The final step would be approval from three-quarters of the league’s 31 other owners, which could come at league meetings next month. After that, NFL owners are next scheduled to meet in December. Under NFL ownership rules, the Pegulas are allowed to own both the Bills and the Sabres because they are located in the same market.","The Pegulas also own the city's ice hockey team, Buffalo Sabres .

The 27-year-old completed the £3.5million move on deadline day following 79 appearances since signing for West Ham in 2012. And Diame has said he is looking forward to playing in his favoured central midfield role at Hull, after feeling that he was misused at times by Sam Allardyce. Done deal: Diame poses with a Hull City shirt after completing his £3.5million move from West Ham . 'Shunted around': The midfielder has admitted he became frustrated with his ever-changing role at West Ham . 'At West Ham I was shunted around all the different positions,' he said, according to the Daily Star. 'I remember one time I had to play as a striker. 'That was not good for my career. I wanted to play for a club that is high in the Premier League table. 'At least with Hull I will be certain of playing in my favoured role. 'I should have left West Ham a long time ago, as with them I wasn't permitted to play in central midfield. Reacquainted: But he will play his debut for Hull against his former side when the Premier League returns . 'I wasn't able to get the biggest clubs interested in me, as when they came to watch me I'd been put in a position that was not mine. 'You lose your bearings when you get shunted around all the different positions.'

"By . Grant Miles for MailOnline . It may have only been an Under 21 fixture against Ipswich but West Ham produced a goal which could have graced any stage. It was not so much the finish from Diafra Sakho itself that was impressive, more the superb one-touch interplay between Alex Song and Ravel Morrison that preceded it. Song, who joined the Hammers on deadline day from Barcelona, showed his superior skills with an array of tricks and flicks, at one point even bringing out a cheeky Rabona. Tiki-taka touch: Alex Song produces a sublime flick to get the move started . Superb stuff: Song and Ravel Morrison combine magnificently as the Hammers get into the box . Connection: The two Hammers midfielders show they can read each other's play in the build-up . Slick: West Ham manage to slice through the Ipswich defence with ease to set up a superb goal . Finish: Diafra Sakho is handed the ball on a plate and duly scores from close range . And his tiki-taka touches clearly spurred Morrison into action, as he linked with his team-mate and stretched for a volley to set up Sakho. And it moved West Ham co-owner David Gold to post a video link to the goal on Twitter with the message: 'Diafra Sakho scored a stunning goal in our 5-1 win against an Ipswich XI yesterday. Well worth watching dg'. Song has signed for West Ham on a season-long loan deal and will be looking to make his debut once he achieves match fitness. And if he produces skill like that in the first-team, he could help counter the accusations of negativity which dog manager Sam Allardyce's style of play. And Song could also be the player who finally inspires Morrison to fulfil his undoubted potential. Matthias Fanimo scored four as the Hammers put on an impressive display against Ipswich - but even that feat could not upstage the superb team goal.","Alex Song and Ravel Morrison put together a series of one touch passes .

"By . MailOnline Reporter . Former swimmer Rebecca Adlington has revealed taking part in I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here inspired her to lose weight in time for her wedding with Harry Needs. The 25-year-old, who won two gold medals at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and bronze at London 2012, decided to retire from professional swimming in February 2013. Adlington, who tied the knot with fellow swimmer Harry Needs at The Ashes, near Leek in Staffordshire, told Hello! magazine: ‘I lost nearly two stone in the jungle and perhaps another four or five pounds since then. So it was a great kick start, and I feel better for it. Rebecca Adlington, 25, married fellow swimmer Harry Needs at The Ashes, near Leek in Staffordshire . Adlington said that taking part in 'I’m A Celebrity' last year inspired her to get in shape . ‘But I don’t like it when people assume you’re really happy because you’re thin. I’m not suddenly confident because I have lost weight, I’m happy because I’m marrying the love of my life.’ In the lead up to the wedding, the former swimmer followed a Harley Street clinic’s weight loss and detox programme. And she capped it off by spending a week at the clinic’s French retreat, which costs up to £3,295 per person. She embarked on a strict programme of vegetable juices, daily yoga and meditation sessions and long walks in the countryside at a secluded chateau in Provence along with her friend, fellow retired swimmer Katherine Wyld.

"By . Carl Markham, Press Association . Stoke utility player Geoff Cameron is to undergo surgery to fix a troublesome hernia problem. The United States international has made just one appearance this season, in the Capital One Cup victory over Portsmouth, but was forced off with the long-standing injury before half-time. Cameron's absence is the second injury blow to hit the Potters after forward Peter Odemwingie had an operation on damaged knee ligaments. Problem: Stoke defender Geoff Cameron will undergo surgery on a hernia issue as he bids to get fully fit . 'It's been troubling him for a while, so the time has come for an operation,' assistant manager Mark Bowen told The Sentinel. 'He started feeling it last season, then obviously went to the World Cup and came back to us still feeling a bit sore. 'These things tend to manifest themselves over a period of months and now the time has come, but it's difficult to say how long we will lose him for.' Odemwingie, who has been omitted from Stoke's 25-man squad submitted to the Premier League for the first half of the campaign because of the length of his lay-off, has yet to start rehabilitation but Bowen remains optimistic. Ruled out: Peter Odemwingie has not been included in Stoke's 25-man squad after damaging knee ligaments . 'The operation seems to have gone well, which is obviously great news and it always helps a recovery when you've got someone of Peter's great spirits,' he added. There was more positive news on midfielder Stephen Ireland, who returned to training on Tuesday after a rib injury sustained on August 22. 'He (Ireland) came through training okay and if he isn't ready for this weekend, then I'm sure he'll be banging on the door for the weekend after,' said Bowen.

"By . Brian Marjoribanks . Rangers striker Kris Boyd admitted he would be prepared to play for free if the financial crisis at Ibrox escalates. The Glasgow giants will learn on Tuesday whether they will be allowed to appeal last Friday’s decision at the Court of Session that saw former director Imran Ahmad succeed in freezing £620,000 of the club’s cash. Ruling in Ahmad’s favour, Lord Stewart declared there to be a ‘risk of Rangers becoming insolvent’ for the second time in just two years with the Championship side only currently having £1.2million in the bank. Charity man: Kris Boyd is supporting a cancer charity and says he will play for Rangers for free . Generosity: Boyd poses with Gillian Hailstones, centre manager of Maggie's, as he lends his support . Boyd turned his back on offers from Scottish Premiership clubs Aberdeen and Dundee United to step down a division with Rangers in the summer after leaving Kilmarnock. But with cash in the bank from lucrative moves to Middlesbrough, Turkey and the United States, the 31-year-old star striker insists money was not his motivation for re-joining the Ibrox men. Boyd said: I’d have walked through those doors for nothing because I was so desperate to play for this club. I wanted the jersey back on. ‘I don’t want to sound smart — or ignorant — but whatever I earn between now and the end of my career is not going to change the way I live. ‘I have managed my finances over the past few years to get what I hope for me and my family going forward is correct. Proud blue: Boyd wants to play for Rangers regardless of their money troubles which are again an issue . ‘So whatever I do between now and (the end of my career) it’s just about getting myself back enjoying the game. ‘I started off as a young kid going on to a football field and scoring goals. I did that last year at Kilmarnock. ‘Did I ask for assurances about the state of Rangers before I signed? You can sit here and talk about assurances but I just want to do the same as I did at Kilmarnock last season and make up for lost time.’ Rangers need their forthcoming £4m ‘open’ share offer to be fully subscribed to enable them to pay player and staff wages, which fall due on the last Thursday of this month. On top of that, they still owe £1.5m in loans to Sandy Easdale and George Letham, debts that were originally due to have been paid off by the end of August. Firepower: Boyd has been leading the line for the Ibrox club since re-signing from Kilmarnock in the summer . Top class: Boyd makes an ambitious attempt at goal during Rangers' game against Queen of the South . The club also seem likely now to bring forward an EGM designed to seek permission for a larger scale share issue, which could allow prospective investors Mike Ashley or Dave King to plough much-needed funds into the club. Almost 500 Rangers fans have signed up to a scheme seeking to buy a controlling stake in the club since the share issue was launched last month. Backed by Supporters Direct Scotland, fans’ group Rangers First have set up a similar scheme to the one used to rescue Hearts from their administration battle. Fightback: Rangers fans will have to copy Boyd's fighting spirit to keep their club going with donations . They now say that have seen the number of members volunteering monthly donations rise to over 1,400. At current totals, the scheme is pulling in almost £32,500 a month and organisers have now revealed they will use some of that income to take part in this month’s open offer. Kris Boyd was speaking as Rangers unveiled Maggie’s as the Rangers Charity Foundation’s new National Charity Partner for season 2014/15 in memory of the late, great Sandy Jardine.

He said: ‘I discussed my future with Roma sporting director Walter Sabatini. He told me that the club wanted to hold on to me, but that they needed the money from a sale. That annoyed me, because I initially wanted to stay put.' Transfer: Centre-back Mehdi Benatia moved from Roma to Bayern Munich for £20m this summer .

"By . Dominic King for the Daily Mail . Follow @@DominicKing_DM . Gareth Southgate has urged his England squad not to fall into the trap he did as a player and wilt under play-off pressure. The Under-21s will discover the identity of the opponents standing in their way of Euro 2015 when the draw is made on Friday and Southgate intends to draw on personal experience to help this group through their biggest test. Saido Berahino was the star of the show in Moldova for England U21 as he bagged a brace . Southgate played in the second leg of England’s clash with Scotland at Wembley in November 1999 and he remembers how a team containing David Beckham, Michael Owen and Alan Shearer almost threw away a place at Euro 2000 as the occasion got to them. He does, however, want the Under-21s to experience the tension of a game when, potentially, one mistake could lead to a year’s work unravelling, as Southgate is adamant it will accelerate their development. ‘I played in the debacle at home,’ Southgate recalled. ‘We were under more pressure at Wembley. Everyone expected Hampden to be the game when it would be tough but Paul Scholes got a couple of goals early and it killed that match. ‘But there is something about [having a lead] that makes everyone anxious. There were top players that night who just couldn’t keep the ball. It was incredible really. I can remember some of our top players giving it away all the time. It’s something we will have to deal with.’ Harry Kane challenges for the ball during the U21 showdown between Moldova and the Young Lions . A 3-0 victory in Moldova on Tuesday stretched England’s winning run under Southgate to eight games but there is no sense that the comfortable manner in which they have been winning games will breed complacency in the group. Dangers lurk throughout the draw - Germany, Spain, France and Portugal are all in the mix, while the potential for a reunion with Serbia remains on the cards - but Southgate is happy for his squad to be scrutinised. ‘I strongly believe that if they do the right things, as they have done, then they will get there,’ said Southgate. ‘If they don’t, then it is another two big, pressure games they have been involved in. We will review it and move on. That is how it works. ‘In the club game, and in the seniors, sometimes that pressure can mean change. You have to live with that as a head coach. That’s not necessarily where we are at this age group. It is a positive pressure rather than a negative pressure. ‘We want to go and test ourselves against the best. We want to start achieving things so the other teams at St George’s see us and think “they were the first group to win the Under-21s”.’ Gareth Southgate looks on during the clash between Moldova U21 and England U21 .","Under-21s will discover the identity of the opponents standing in their way of Euro 2015 on Friday .

Married Mark Benson, 51, tried to kiss and grope his victims as he carried out searches at Leeds Bradford Airport and even put his hands inside their clothing. Leeds Crown Court heard he also made unwanted sexual advances to female members of staff in locker rooms or other staff areas while they were alone. Security guard Mark Benson, 51, tried to kiss and grope his victims as he searched them at Leeds Bradford Airport (above) and even put his hands inside their clothing. He admitted seven offences of sexual assault . Benson, from Leeds, West Yorkshire, was jailed for 70 weeks yesterday after pleading guilty to seven offences of sexual assault. Jon Gregg, prosecuting, said Benson tricked two of his victims into giving him their mobile phone numbers before sending them sexually explicit messages. He then told one of his victims he 'knew she wanted it' and said he knew of somewhere they could go where there were no CCTV cameras. The woman told Benson he was old enough to be her father and was married but he still persisted, the court heard. Mr Gregg said: 'Undaunted by that, he unzipped her coat and tried to undo her blouse buttons. 'All the while she was trying to pull his arm away and mentioning his wife. He said she would never find out.' The court was told one of Benson's victims had to undergo counselling as a result of her ordeal. After being arrested, he initially denied the offences and claimed the allegations against him were made up. Leeds Crown Court heard how Benson also made unwanted sexual advances to female members of staff in while they were alone. He was jailed for 70 weeks and ordered to sign the sex offenders' register for two years . Tony Kellbrick, defending, said: 'For reasons he can't explain he has become hyper-sexualised and he is not willing or able to admit it. 'What I am seeking to do on this defendant's behalf is suggest that, for some obscure reason that he cannot fully understand or accept is that he suddenly thinks he is God's gift to the female half of the race and here he is seeking emotional and sexual attention from them. 'He has lost his job, he has lost his wife and he has lost his home. He is on job seekers allowance. In some ways he is the author of his own downfall.' Judge Penelope Belcher said the offences could only be met with an immediate custody as they were too serious to be dealt with by a community-punishment. Benson was also ordered to sign the sex offenders' register for two years.","Mark Benson, 51, tried to kiss and grope victims during searches at airport .

"By . Madlen Davies for MailOnline . For little Jacob Madgin simple tasks like preparing food, taking a bath or passing a dog in the street can leave him literally scared stiff. The four-year-old's entire body will become rigid if he is shocked, causing him to suffer seizures and spasms. Jacob, from Wallsend in North Tyneside has the rare condition hyperekplexia, also known as 'startle disease'. The inherited condition, which is thought to affect only 70 families worldwide, can cause Jacob to stop breathing and choke. Lesley Madgin, 48, has to watch four year old son Jacob constantly as  he could choke or stop breathing due to 'startle disease', which causes his body to become rigid when he becomes shocked . Everyday occurrences like taking a bath, preparing food or seeing a dog in the street can trigger the condition, making it impossible to know when Jacob could have a serious episode . Jacob is unable to alert others to what is happening, as the condition leaves him unable to cough or shout as his throat goes into spasm. His mother Lesley Madgin, 48, said everyday occurrences like taking a bath, preparing food or passing a dog on the street can cause Jacob to spasm and seize up. She said: ‘You never know what might trigger Jacob’s condition. When I was opening a box of blueberries the noise of the plastic as I opened the lid set him off. ‘In the past it used to be animals as he could not go passed a dog without going into spasm, but now he’s fine with dogs. 'Another time he asked to have a ride on a pony but as he approached the pony his whole body went stiff.' Anything can set off Jacob’s condition and the unpredictably of the illness makes it almost impossible to know when he will have a serious episode. Hyperkplexia - also known as startle disease - is a rare neurological disorder which causes sufferers to react in an exaggerated way when startled. They become rigid and unable to move, and sometimes stop breathing, which can prove fatal. The main symptoms of the condition include stiffness that can prevent the person from moving. It can cause them to fall, stiffly, like a log, without loss of consciousness. When a baby startles, it may be accompanied by non-epileptic seizures with increased stiffness and twitching. Simple activities, such as having a bath, can trigger the condition. There is no cure for the illness but medication can help to ease the symptoms. Mrs Madgin, a teaching assistant, said the condition means she worries about her son constantly. She said: ‘I’d love to wrap him up in cotton wool but I try to treat him as I would any child, although it’s difficult to cut the apron ties as I worry about him all the time.’ Jacob was born naturally five days early, weighing a healthy 7lb 10lbs. But within 32 hours Mrs Madgkin and her husband Allan, 56, a nursing assistant, knew something was wrong with their son noticing he was ‘twitchy and upset'. Jacob had to be fed through a tube because every time the family tried breast or bottle feeding he would spasm as his nose touched a teat. It was not until he was eight-months-old that experts made an official diagnoses, following a number of tests and examinations. Now the family try to avoid anything that might scare Jacob - even water being splashed on him. Mrs Madgin has to watch her son constantly so he doesn’t choke, and worries that as a child he is oblivious to the danger presented by his seizures and spasms. She said: ‘When Jacob was initially diagnosed I felt OK about it because we were told that the most difficult time would be the first year of his life and I felt it could be worse. ‘But it’s a very difficult condition to manage and I have to watch him all the time as he can choke on anything. ‘It is sad that he has this hereditary condition and I do worry that he will get teased as he gets older. 'We just have to take it one day at a time, but Jacob has not got an awareness of danger and that makes it even worse.’ Despite his rare condition, parents say Jacob Madgin is a 'quick, bright and intelligent' boy who has a great sense of humour and is loved by everyone . Although there is no cure for the illness,  Jacob takes medication to relax his muscles . Tomorrow Jacob will start his first day at school in Wallsend, North Tyneside, and he will get one-to-one support to make sure he’s safe and well. Mrs Madgin said: ‘Jacob has a brilliant sense of humour and he’s a fantastic, funny boy that everybody loves. 'He attracts people wherever he goes and he’s always smiling. He is a very quick, bright and intelligent boy.’ Both Mr and Mrs Madgin carry the faulty gene that causes hyperekplexia, but fortunately their eldest son, Josh, seven, did not inherit the illness. Jacob is monitored by consultants at the Great North Children’s Hospital, based at Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary, and takes medication to relax his muscles. Children’s charity Action Medical Research has funded studies looking at the genes that cause the condition and Mrs Madgin is keen to raise awareness to the rare disease. Dr Caroline Johnston, research evaluation manager at Action Medical Research said: ‘Although the symptoms of startle disease often fade by the time babies reach their first birthday, they can continue throughout childhood and into adulthood, with some children experiencing severe breathing problems and others having learning difficulties.' Both Mr and Mrs Madgin carry the faulty gene that causes hyperekplexia, but fortunately their eldest son, Josh, seven (pictured right) did not inherit the illness . 'Startle disease' is so rare that it is thought to affect just 70 families worldwide. Charity Action Medical Research is looking into the genes which cause the condition . She added that further research could lead to a new genetic test to identify babies with ‘startle disease’. She said: ‘Action has funded research looking at the genes which cause startle disease in the hope of giving more babies access to a full diagnosis. ‘The research could lead to a new genetic test for babies and children. If diagnosed correctly, babies can be treated with drugs that help reduce the unwanted startle reaction and also reduce muscle stiffness.’ Action Medical Research has launched a new ‘Bear Miles for Breakthroughs’ appeal featuring Paddington.

"By . Marielle Simon for Daily Mail Australia . AFL Melbourne players Dean Terlich (left) and Alex Georgiou (right) were of an uncanny resemblance of the disgraced Rolf Harris and a girl at Mad Monday festivities . AFL club Melbourne has apologised for the 'poor and inconsiderate mistake' two of its players made by dressing up as Rolf Harris and a young girl for yesterday's 'Mad Monday' celebrations. The Demons issued a statement saying they would investigate the incident after Dean Terlich, dressed as Harris, and teammate Alex Georgiou were photographed in the distasteful costumes. Terlich put the photo on his Instagram account. 'Dean and Alex have made a poor and inconsiderate mistake in choosing their costume’s today,' a spokesman told the Herald Sun. 'We will speak to these players about their error in judgment.' Wearing a fake goatee, grey wig, short red tie, striped blazer and rectangular glasses, Terlich's get-up was uncannily accurate to the musician, who was recently found guilty on 12 charges of indecent assault of four female victims and sentenced to five years and nine months in an England jail. Terlich was snapped next to Georgiou, who was dressed as a girl, wearing a wig with long black plaits and a red checkered dress.

Mark Cavendish asked not to be selected in the Great Britain squad for this month's Road World Championships in Spain as he continues his recovery from the crash that ended his Tour de France. Cavendish, the 2011 world champion, required shoulder surgery after crashing out of the opening stage of the Tour in Harrogate and would not be suited to the hilly Ponferrada road race course which hosts the World Championships on September 28. After the squad was announced on Thursday, the 29-year-old Manxman revealed it was his decision not to take part. Crashed out: Mark Cavendish required surgery after a crash on the opening stage of the Tour de France in July . 'For clarification, I requested NOT to be considered for this years World Champs, With the current GB riders, there's better guys for the job,' Cavendish wrote on Twitter. The eight-man British team in the event, which features 28 climbs in 254.8 kilometres, has options, with 2013 Tour de France champion Chris Froome, Commonwealth Games gold medallist Geraint Thomas, Ben Swift and the Yates brothers potential leaders, depending how the race develops.

Armitstead will be without the support of Emma Pooley, who retired following her silver medal in Glasgow, but mountain bike riders Annie Last and Alice Barnes, sister of Hannah Barnes, could make the final cut on the road after being named in the long list. Commonwealth Games time-trial champion Alex Dowsett and Sir Bradley Wiggins, silver medallist in 2013 behind Germany's Tony Martin, are in contention for the two places in the men's time-trial, which takes place on September 24, but there will be no British representative in the women's race against the clock. The World Championships begin on September 21 with trade team time-trials and also includes age-group events, with Britain refining selection prior to the event. British Cycling technical director Shane Sutton said: 'We're fortunate to have a strong pool of riders from which to make our final selection.'

"By . Stephen Mcgowan For The Daily Mail . Gordan Strachan has revealed he already knows which goalkeeper will be handed the task of keeping world champions Germany at bay in Dortmund this weekend. But the Scotland boss will pick his moment to break the news after choosing between Allan McGregor, David Marshall and Craig Gordon posed one of the toughest calls of his 18-month tenure. ‘I’m clearer,’ said Strachan on the issue. ‘I’ve been clear for a while. But it’ s a hard one and then you see Craig Gordon come in and you think, “Whoa”. Decisions: Gordon Strachan says he has already decided who will start in goal for Scotland against Germany . ‘The goalkeeping coach Jim Stewart is really pleased with him and you wouldn’t know he’s been away. ‘I haven’t told them who is playing yet — I’ll tell them after the game! ‘That’s something I need to discuss with Jim. You never know the best moment to tell them. You have to sense when that is for everyone. ‘It’s not like it has to be at a specific time, but it will be before the team in general is announced, that’s for sure.’ Former Scotland No 1 Gordon had made way for Hull’s McGregor and Cardiff keeper Marshall after spending two years on the sidelines with knee problems. Celtic: Craig Gordon is one of the options as Scotland begin the Euro 16 qualifying campaign . Back playing first-team football with Celtic, however, the 31-year-old’s return has created the strongest goalkeeper pool a Scotland boss has had to choose from in years. ‘It’s usually been two, thinking back to Andy Goram and Jim Leighton,’ Strachan admitted. ‘Look at England as well when they had Peter Shilton and Ray Clemence. You couldn’t remember the third one. ‘So we’re strong and it’s a fantastic bonus having Craig along here, it really is. ‘The goalie’s position is more specialised and you can maybe move outfield players around a wee bit more. Europa: Allan McGregor's Hull side failed to make it into the Europa League group stages . ‘But whoever is not playing, they know that there is a great goalie in front of them - but that they are a great goalie, too. ‘Sometimes the goalie can be picked depending on whether or not you are away or at home, believe it or not.’ Strachan confirmed Darren Fletcher will be his captain following his successful return to the Manchester United first team but he lost another midfielder, West Brom star Graham Dorrans, to injury yesterday. Christophe Berra and young left-back Andrew Robertson have also pulled out, with Aberdeen’s Mark Reynolds the only replacement so far. Revealed: Strachan said he would wait until the right time to inform the players about who would start . On Dorrans, Strachan said: ‘He has been playing with an injury the last few weeks. ‘It was great he came up here and gave it a couple of days’ rest and tried to train yesterday, but he wasn’t comfortable, so he is away back to his club now to get assessed. ‘Christophe has been scoring goals, as well. But his injury was bad enough not to allow him to travel. ‘Andy came up and tried his best. We felt it wasn’t worthwhile pushing it because he couldn’t train. ‘We are okay. We are happy with the training we have done. Everybody else has been involved. ‘We picked a few extra players because we knew we might get some knocks, so we are well covered.’","Scotland face Germany this weekend in Euro 16 qualifiers .

"By . Stephen Mcgowan For The Daily Mail . Aiden McGeady has blamed down-sizing and cost cutting for Celtic’s failure to reach the Champions League. The Everton winger left Parkhead for Spartak Moscow in a £9.5million deal in 2010.

Fan fury: Security staff were called in to keep an eye on the protest . ‘It (Champions League failure) is a big blow for the club and obviously the people who hold the purse strings at the club,’ said McGeady, ‘but I suppose you get what you pay for in the end if you decide to downsize, cut costs, and don’t pay three, four of five million pounds for players anymore. ‘Then you can’t really expect to get into the Champions League but that’s just the way it is at the minute I think.’ A lifelong Celtic fan McGeady has established himself in the Goodison first team, but admits to keeping a close eye on the fortunes of the Parkhead club. A first team player under Martin O’Neill and Gordon Strachan, the 28-year-old admits he had never heard of coach Ronny Deila before his appointment.

I was expecting they would put someone in there who is a bit more well known, someone with more pedigree. ‘They started off okay I suppose but things just aren’t going right at the minute. Obviously it’s a combination of everything because you’ve got fans venting frustration at the board for not spending money and then it seemed that every player who was coming in was a loan signing. ‘I still watch all the games I can and obviously want the team to do well. It’s disappointing to see the team doing poorly - but I still think they’ll win the league easily enough.’","Everton winger says they have paid ultimate price for failure to invest .

Scroll down for video . The accident which occurred on the Pacific Highway north of Ballina almost split the vehicle in two . The four young people, all aged between 16 and 22, are believed to have died on impact . The occupants, aged between 16 and 22, were travelling in a Hyundai Excel which was attempting to overtake a B-double on a stretch of the Pacific Highway . Richard Wells, left and William Manton, died when the car they were travelling in slammed in to a tree in northern NSW . Police are now investigating whether speed and alcohol may have been a factor in the crash that killed four young friends - who were believed to have been travelling to buy a cigarette lighter. Ms Camidge was driving the 40km-stretch needed to make the journey when the noise of the accident woke nearby residents. Police Inspector Nicole Bruce said the force of the impact, which almost split the vehicle in two, would have been so severe that the four would have died instantly. She said the driver attempted to pass a B-double truck over double lines while driving from Byron Bay to Ballina and then swerved to miss another oncoming truck. 'They missed the truck but lost control and heavily impacted with a tree almost splitting the car in half,' she told AAP.  'It was fairly horrific. NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said the accident was a 'tragedy beyond description.' 'This is a tragedy that is beyond description,' he told Macquarie Radio on Wednesday. 'There is no way you can describe this - four young Australians are dead.' Samantha Enright, 17 (right),  and Jessica Camidge, 22 (left), were also victims in the fatal crash .

Police and emergency services after the 22-year-old female driver attempted to overtake a B-double truck before swerving to miss another, and hitting a tree . The incident occurred along a stretch of highway which was undergoing upgrades in northern NSW . A Newrybar resident, near to where the accident occurred, said he was woken at 2am to a 'loud bang' and the sound of helicopters circling above. 'We were woken by a loud bang around 2am, then surrounded by helicopters for the next few hours,' Peter Siefken told AAP. Mr Scipione encouraged parents to talk to their children about driving safely in the wake of Wednesday's multiple fatality. 'Get those that you know that aren't that experienced, sit them down and talk to them, have a look at those images (of the crash).' 'Let them know that lives will be changed forever as a result of a stupid act that happened late last night.' 'We all have to learn from these sorts of tragedies or the people that have died have died for no reason.' The fatal smash occurred along an 80km/h section of road, which is undergoing a long-awaited upgrade. The Tintenbar to Ewingsdale upgrade, which will replace the deadly single-lane stretch of highway with dual carriageway, is expected to open in six months, Ballina Shire mayor David Wright said. 'This is a tragic loss of life and shows how imperative this highway upgrade is,' Mr Wright told AAP. However, Mr Siefken said the roadworks had created a hazard for motorists. Wednesday's crash is hauntingly similar to a crash in nearby Broken Head in 2006 that claimed the lives of four teenage friends and shocked the community. Four years later, three friends in their 20s were killed on the Pacific Highway at Ewingsdale when their car collided with a B-double truck. More recently, a 41-year-old man and a 72-year-old woman were killed in a crash at Woodburn, south of Ballina, on the Pacific Highway.

"By . Stephen Mcgowan for MailOnline . Rangers edged closer to financial meltdown on Friday after former director Imran Ahmad succeeded in freezing £620,000 of the club’s cash. In a hearing at the Court of Session in Edinburgh, Lord Stewart ruled in Ahmad’ s favour despite learning the stricken club have just £1.2million left in the bank and could soon be insolvent. Rangers have vowed to appeal the verdict and will return to the court on Tuesday after a claim the club’s finances were the ‘envy of many English Premiership sides’ was rejected. Money: Former Rangers commercial director Imran Ahmad has taken the club to court to try and freeze £620,000 of the Ibrox club's assets . Success needed: Rangers will hope the Glasgow giants can gain promotion from the Scottish Championship . Back on the brink: If the shares issues fails to reach at least £3m then Rangers' future could be uncertain again . A Rangers spokesman said: ‘Further to the Stock Exchange announcement regarding the court action taken by Imran Ahmad against Rangers, whatever the outcome of the court process, we agree with Judge Lord Stewart when he told the court: “This does not mean to say that insolvency is an actuality or is going to happen”. ‘We remain confident that the Club will be able to continue to operate as normal.’ But directors desperately need the forthcoming £4m ‘open’ share offer to be fully subscribed to enable them to pay player and staff wages, which fall due on the last Thursday of this month. On top of that, they still owe £1.5m in loans to Sandy Easdale and George Letham, debts that were originally due to have been paid off by the end of August. Lawyers for Ahmad argued he is owed a £500,000 bonus, plus £120,000 in legal costs, for the time he spent working at Rangers and went to court amid concerns the club will have no cash to pay him if he wins his claim in November. Ahmad, who left the Ibrox side in April 2013, maintains he is entitled to five per cent of commercial contracts negotiated by him subject to written approval from the chief executive. He previously contended that a letter from then chief executive Charles Green had confirmed that his bonus for 2013 would be ‘no less than £500,000’. Friday was the third time the former Zeus Capital executive had tried to ring-fence the amount. Disgraced: Craig Whyte put Rangers into administration in 2012 when he was in charge of the club . Despite expressing sympathy for an increasingly concerned Rangers support, Lord Stewart decided there was a ‘risk’ of the Glasgow side suffering an insolvency event and ordered that the money be set aside immediately. ‘I have a great deal of sympathy for Rangers fans who are bystanders in these events,’ said Lord Stewart. ‘I have formed the view that there is a risk of Rangers becoming insolvent. ‘That is not to say there is an actuality or a certainty that insolvency is something that will happen. At this stage, it is only a risk.’ The £4m share issue announced last Friday is designed to meet the club’s short-term needs and will cover the wage bill if investors respond. But Rangers seem likely now to bring forward an EGM designed to seek permission for a larger scale share issue which could allow prospective investors Mike Ashley or Dave King to plough much-needed funds into the club. Rangers advocate Alan Summers QC claimed on Friday that the club were in ‘advanced’ discussions with two unnamed prospective investors but failed to convince the judge Rangers’ finances were really improving. He said: ‘When we were last here, we heard how the share issue would only keep the lights on at Ibrox. I can tell you that the floodlights are back on at Ibrox and are in no danger of being switched off. ‘The most turbulent financial period in history is now in the past and the club is moving upwards towards profitability. ‘Talks are at an advanced stage with two potential investors. The club has not been in rude health for some time but the situation is improving. The club is trading its way out of difficulties. It’s current position is the envy of many English Premiership clubs. ‘It is moving upwards through the leagues. The plan is for it to return into the Scottish Premiership and into the promised land of European competition where there is big money to be made through gate money, television rights and the like.’ Happier times: McCoist and Paul Gascoigne celebrate wining the Coca-Cola Cup in 1996 . Rangers chief executive Graham Wallace also provided a statement to the court claiming the club was in good financial health and would continue to grow. But Ahmad’s legal representative told the court that there was no proof the forthcoming share issue or the season ticket sales could keep the club solvent and that there was no guarantee that investors would come forward to save the side. Advocate Kenny McBrearty QC added: ‘A pattern of diminishing working capital is evident. There is no concrete saviour for Rangers.’ Lord Stewart fixed a hearing at the Court of Session for Rangers to appeal on Tuesday and on Friday night a Rangers statement read: ‘The Company confirms that the Court of Session in Edinburgh has granted a request by Mr Ahmad for an order allowing him to arrest £620,000 in a Rangers bank account or the accounts of others who may be due to pay sums to Rangers. ‘He sought this order in connection with a claim against the Rangers Football Club Limited for alleged unpaid bonuses in the amount of £500,000. The court granted permission to arrest £620,000 to take account of the sum sued for and Mr Ahmad’s legal expenses in connection with his claim. ‘Leave to appeal this decision has been sought by Rangers and the court will deal with that request on Tuesday. ‘This is a provisional procedural measure and the fact that this procedural ruling is in Mr Ahmad’s favour it is in not an indication that the court accepts there is any merit in his claim. The court has not yet considered the merits of Mr Ahmad’s claim. Mr Ahmad’s claim is being robustly defended. ‘The case proceeds to a full hearing on its merits commencing 11 November 2014. If the defence of this claim is successful the funds arrested will be released.’ Concern: Ally McCoist is worried about the club's perilous finances and the prospect of administration . Rangers precarious financial position was brought in to sharp focus last week when the embattled club issued a statement to the Stock Exchange saying it had to find an injection of funding or ‘the company will be unable to pay its creditors as they fall due and the future of the company will be uncertain.’ The statement added: ‘The directors will immediately have to seek emergency financing which may or may not be available.’ There then followed revelations that that name rights for Ibrox Stadium had been sold to Newcastle owner Ashley for £1 in a deal with Charles Green last year. And, in a newspaper interview this week, Rangers director Sandy Easdale alluded to the increasingly fraught financial situation at the club. Asked about the ‘level of anxiety growing among fans’, Easdale said: ‘Yes I do feel it. It’s realistic because the club must raise funds to go forward. If we don’t then we’ll have to look at cutting the expenditure even more.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Ex-Rangers commercial director Imran Ahmad goes to court for third time .

On the ball: Ryan Gauld (right) in action for Scotland Under 21s against Luxembourg . Learning curve: Ryan Gauld (right) chats to Sporting Lisbon team-mate Mahmoud Shikabala having arrived at the Portuguese club from Dundee United earlier this summer . Gauld celebrated the news with his first goals at Under 21 level when his double helped Billy Stark’s side end their European Championship campaign on a high with a 3-0 win in Luxembourg - following on from last week’s 1-1 draw away to group winners Slovakia. But he was clearly still shocked to have been presented with even a remote chance by Sporting Lisbon of making an appearance against Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea, Schalke 04 and Celtic’s conquerors Maribor in Group G of this season’s European club spectacular. Gauld, who signed a six-year contract with the Portuguese giants in the summer for a fee thought to be in the region of £3million, with a buy-out clause of £47.8million eye-catchingly inserted, said of his inclusion in the Sporting Lisbon squad: ‘I heard about it through Twitter, actually. It’s great to be in the squad and hopefully at some point I can maybe even be a part of it in games. ‘I was actually quite surprised because I’ve been playing with the B team. The A team have got a lot of depth and strength in the team so when the news did come out I was quite surprised. ‘There was no indication from the manager Marco Silva because I think the draw was just a couple of days before I came back so there wasn’t too much said about it. They were just going about it week by week so I’m just delighted with being named in the squad and I’m looking forward to it. Finishing school: Gauld fires home his second goal for Scotland . Celebration time: The playmaker dubbed 'Baby Messi' is congratulated by team-mate John McGinn . ‘I can only keep doing my best and keep doing what I try and do best and keep plugging away to make sure I am in his thoughts. ‘To be involved in any way would be a great experience and something I would remember for a long time. ‘But at the same time I’m not expecting anything. I’m keeping things realistic and I’m not hoping for too much, too soon. ‘There have been a lot of new experiences just in the couple of months or so that I’ve been there - and there have been a lot of challenges as well. ‘I’m sure there will be more to come and I can only look forward to it.’ Now Gauld - who was mobbed by Sporting Lisbon autograph hunters after the game in Luxembourg - has to deal with the really difficult bit - getting tickets for the Champions League matches for his mates. He admitted: ‘I’ve already had a couple of requests! I’m sure I’ll hear from a few more of my friends before the games. ‘I’ve also had a few texts congratulating me and it comes up in conversation because I keep in touch with them all. It’s nice for me.’ Gauld believes his experiences in Portugal have already helped him improve his game since his summer move from Tannadice. Marked man: Gauld emerged as a promising youngster at Dundee United in 2012 . Rising star: Gauld is regarded as a big prospect for Scotland . He said: ‘The tempo of games in Portugal is closer to international games. When you play in the Scottish Premiership and you go away and play in an international game it’s hard to adapt to it really quickly because the speed of the game is much quicker at international level, that’s the main difference. ‘Being in Portugal is making me adapt to that more easily at international level as well.’ Gauld has already been tipped by many observers for a call-up to Gordon Strachan’s side, but is just concentrating on the next campaign for Stark’s Under 21s. And he’s optimistic about the future for the young Scots. He said: ‘We’ve played a really young team in both games this last week and that’s promising as we look to the next campaign. ‘Slovakia are a really good outfit and we did very well against them, although obviously conceding in the last minute put us on a bit of a downer. ‘Luxembourg can make life really difficult for teams - Holland only won here on the back of a penalty - so we can be happy with ourselves scoring three goals and keeping a clean sheet. ‘Everyone obviously gets on very well together and that helps and you are building personal relationships that help on the pitch as well. Everything is looking good towards the next campaign.’","Gauld set to be Scotland's only representative in Europe's top club competition .

"By . Damian Spellman, Press Association . Aiden McGeady was the hero as the Republic of Ireland launched their Euro 2106 qualifying campaign with a dramatic victory in Georgia. The Everton winger struck twice, the second of them in the 90th minute, to clinch a 2-1 win at the Boris Paichadze Dinamo Arena in Tbilisi and earn the plaudits of both manager Martin O’Neill and skipper Robbie Keane. O’Neill said: 'He was the only player on the field that was scoring the goal. He really is a fantastic talent. Get in there! Aiden McGeady celebrates his 90th minute winner that got Ireland off to a perfect start . Stunning finish: McGeady fooled a defender with a turn inside the box before curling home past the keeper . 'He probably thinks at this age he should have been up there with the very finest players. He has that talent and he showed that tonight.' Long-time team-mate Keane was equally effusive after seeing McGeady, who had opened the scoring with 24 minutes gone, snatch the points at the death after turning on the edge of the penalty area and curling a delicious shot past substitute keeper Roin Kvashvadze. Keane said: 'If you score a goal like that, you deserve to win the game. If anyone else did that, the top players in the world, you would be talking about it for a long time. 'The turn, the touch, the finish - only he could do that. No-one else on that field would have been able to do that.' McGeady, who played under O’Neill during his time as Celtic manager, had scored only three goals in his previous 69 appearances for his country. At the double: Earlier in the match McGeady finished off a move for his fourth international goal . Delight: McGeady wheels away after scoring Ireland's first before later going on to win the game for them . His double in Tbilisi in his manager’s first competitive game - he also scored in the 62-year-old’s first friendly against Latvia in November last year - increased his relatively meagre tally significantly, and the second of them proved priceless. McGeady was applauded back into the away dressing room after conducting a series of interviews following the final whistle, and admitted he did not know what to do with himself. He said: 'I’d been doing a few interviews outside while the manager was talking to the team about the game. I was a bit awkward when it happened, I didn’t know how to react really. It was nice.' Asked about his decisive strike, he added: 'The second goal was all about concentrating on my touch. I had my back to the goal, I just thought I’d try something. It came off for me. 'It doesn’t happen very often for me, but thankfully it went in.' My boy: Martin O'Neill shakes McGeady's hand at full-time and he had some good words to say about him . McGeady’s 24th-minute strike gave Ireland an early advantage which was cancelled out in spectacular style by Tornike Okriashvili seven minutes before half-time. The game looked to be heading for a draw until the Ireland midfielder span and delivered the denouement to send the small band of travelling supporters into raptures. O’Neill said: 'We scored a goal got a goal in front, and we were at our most comfortable when they equalised. It changed the complexion and momentum of the game. There was moments in the second half when it might have been worrying for us, but we’ve seen it through. 'I think there’s improvement in the team - we’ve won away from home, which is terrific - but there’s definitely improvement in the team.' Our savour: The rest of the Ireland team mob McGeady after he struck to give them all three points in Tblisi . For Georgia boss Temuri Ketsbaia, a sixth successive defeat by Ireland proved hard to accept. He said: 'Ireland’s second goal was the only moment of quality in the second half. Perhaps a draw would have been a fair result and left both teams happy. 'Our performance is not what we want to see and we definitely want to see better games and results. We have limitations in the team and in Georgian football in general - that is the reality we have to face. 'We cannot fault the players’ effort and they stuck to task for 99 per cent of the time, but Ireland have 25 players who play at the top level with most in the Premier League.'","Everton midfielder turned and shot to win the game for Ireland late on .

He said: ‘I spent three mornings in a hide near the loch and the ospreys were amazing to watch as they swooped into the water from a really high height. ‘The birds are feeding up to maintain their weight for migration. I was lucky as I had a great view of feeding time from my hide. ‘It’s not the easiest photography, when an osprey dives for a fish the whole dive lasts just a few seconds and a steady hand and even steadier nerves are required to get the images of the birds fishing.’ Ospreys are busy feeding up on fish – the only food they consume - before beginning their long migration to West Africa for the winter.

"By . Leesa Smith for Daily Mail Australia . Perth has been given the unwanted title of Australia's accidental overdose capital while Adelaide comes in at a close second with the rise in the misuse of painkillers labelled as the reason for the increase. Brisbane was next on the dreaded list followed by Sydney and then Melbourne while figures were not provided for Tasmania, Canberra and the Northern Territory. The Western Australian capital city rate of 5.6 overdose deaths per 100,000 rose above the national average of four deaths per 100,000, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics mortality data. The number of these accidental overdoses had more than doubled in Perth in 2012 with 106 deaths compared to only 49 deaths a decade earlier. A rise in misuse of prescription painkillers, now dubbed as 'harmaceuticals', including powerful opioids - oxycodone and fentanyl - has been linked with the alarming increase in deaths. Former junkie Patrick McKenzie, who turned to prescribed medication when he couldn't get this hands on heroin, was not surprised by the data saying the access to such drugs had 'boomed' in recent years. The data from a decade up until 2012 shows that Perth has the most accidental overdoses than anywhere else in the country . The increase has been linked with the rise in misuse of prescription painkillers, now dubbed as 'harmaceuticals', including powerful opioids - oxycodone and fentanyl . Former junkie Patrick McKenzie was not surprised by the alarming data saying the access to such drugs had 'boomed' in recent years . Mr McKenzie said the two most common types of users were those with genuine pain who misused prescription medication and those who weren't in pain but illegally obtain legal pharmaceuticals. The latter was the path that Mr McKenzie went down. 'I got them on the black market - just off the street - it was really easy,' he said. 'It's demand driven - people will resort to whatever mechanisms they can to get them.' But he said prescriptions were also easy to obtain through the legal avenues of a doctor's clinic. 'There seems to have been a change in the way doctors prescribe because they are much more available now,' he said. Meanwhile, accidental drug overdoses are happening more outside of Australia's capital cities for the first time as more remote areas have less access to adequate treatment and services. Experts say a reason for the shift was a lack of choice when 'doctor shopping' in the areas away from the Big Smoke which has seen more people relying on prescribed drugs and even accessing medication through the black market. After living in Sydney for 25 years, Mr McKenzie moved to Townsville to start a new life and although he has been clean for the past 16 months, he said prescribed medication was a big problem in the northern Queensland town. 'There is no heroin here - in the big cities like Sydney and Melbourne you have got a pretty available heroin market - but here it's all black market pharmaceuticals,' he said. 'It all comes back to the fact that heroin was available on prescription for people they would not be using oxycodone and fentanyl - it's a pretty strong convincing argument for regulated supply.' Mr McKenzie said prescriptions were also easy to obtain through the legal avenues of a doctor's clinic . The accidental overdose death rate is now higher away from the east coast's city lights in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, according to the latest statistics commissioned by the Penington Institute in Melbourne. 'Which means that it's almost certainly due to prescription drug misuse,' Mr Ryan said. The institute's CEO John Ryan said there has not been a shift in heroin use in regional areas . 'For example, oxycodone and fentanyl are powerful opioid painkillers and the number of prescriptions is rising. 'Overdose deaths involving these types of drugs are increasing as community use levels go up.' Other reasons for the increase in accidental overdoses has been put down to waiting lists for methodone programs and inevitably longer ambulance response times in the regional and rural area. Mr McKenzie said access to methodone was rare in the Townsville area. 'Here the drug that is used is buprenorphine which is not as strong - it doesn't have that same kind of bang and it can be difficult of people to access treatment,' he said. Mr Ryan said people rely on painkiller prescriptions more outside of city because there is less access to specialist pain treatment. 'Methadone programs reduce overall overdose, but in regional and rural areas there are no where near enough prescribers and waiting lists can be years in some parts of country Australia,' Mr Ryan said. 'Doctor shopping is undoubtedly an issue, and in many regional areas there are extensive black markets involving networks covering hundreds of square kilometres,' he said. The number of accidental drug deaths (per 100,000 people) in the regional and rural areas has risen by 127 per cent in the past decade up until 2012. However, it's a different story on the west coast with, Perth coming out on top with more accidental overdoses than anywhere else in the country. Adelaide was the only other capital city that remained higher in mortalities than the rest of the state with more than double the amount of accidental drug-induced deaths compared to the rest of South Australia during the 10 year-period. Although figures were not provided for Tasmania, Canberra and the Northern Territory.","Perth has more accidental overdoses than the rest of Australia .

"By . Jennifer Smith for MailOnline . Joanne Morris was jailed for seven years after police discovered the explosives at her home . A transsexual former soldier has been jailed after hiding a huge stash of explosives, guns and ammunition at her home - yards away from a police station. Joanne Morris, formerly known as Paul, kept detonators and hundreds of rounds of ammunition in flowerbeds at her cottage in preparation for 'World War Three'. The 48-year-old from Bloxwich, West Midlands, was jailed for seven years at Wolverhampton Crown Court. She will serve her sentence in a male prison despite identifying herself as a woman and being referred to as Joanne throughout court proceedings. The court heard how police swooped on her property after noticing a dozen packages from America bearing accessories for firearms. Officers discovered the largest firearms haul of its kind in 10 years at the cottage which Morris shares with her wife of 26 years. Almost 2,000 rounds of ammunitions including 476 bullet point cartridges designed to expand on impact were seized alongside 239 bullet heads, 15 detonators, a 12-bore shotgun and seven sticks of explosives. Some of the equipment was taken when Morris served with the Royal Engineers between 1983 and 1992. Air guns, night vision goggles, a silencer, smoke grenade, harpoon and two samurai swords were also discovered. One hundred officers took three days to search the property with army bomb disposal experts also called to carry out controlled explosions at the scene. Morris pleaded guilty to four charges of unlawfully possessing ammunition and one count of possessing a shotgun. She was jailed for seven years by a judge who described the hoard of explosives as 'lethal' after already spending time in a male prison where she has been 'verbally abused' and 'threatened with rape', the court heard. Almost 2,000 rounds of ammunition  were found at the property in the largest haul of explosives West Midlands Police had seen for 10 years . Police searched the property after noticing a dozen packages from America which bore firearms accessories . Judge John Warner said: 'I accept your transgender issues will have had a profound impact on the way you have lived your life. 'This was the largest haul of ammunition seized by West Midlands Police in the last ten years. 'Properties had to be evacuated, a controlled explosion was required to make the location less dangerous. 'It’s accepted that there has been no link traceable to terrorist groups or organised crime. 'But it was a very, very dangerous, indeed potentially lethal, situation that was created by your possession of these items in an unprotected, unsuitable and unauthorised environment. 'Some people have a fascination with guns and other weapons. That has undoubtedly been a long-standing situation in your case. 'These matters are of very high seriousness. Outside of the field of terrorism and organised crime, this is a wholly exceptional case given the nature of the material recovered. One hundred police officers and army explosives experts were called to search the property in Bloxwich . Officers spent three days rifling through the £120,000 property which Morris shares with her wife of 26 years . Controlled explosions were carried out during the search which required neighbouring houses and Bloxwich police station to be evacuated . Morris served in the Royal Engineers between 1983 and 1992. She had a 'long-standing' obsession with the army, the court heard . It took police and army experts three days to complete the lengthy swoop on Morris's home . Morris will spend three-and-a-half years in prison and the remainder on licence. Prosecutor Hugh O’Brien Quinn said surrounding houses and the nearby Bloxwich police station had to be evacuated as police searched Morris's home. 'Army explosive experts had to be called in. 'Neighbouring properties had to be evacuated as did Bloxwich police station which is a short distance away. 'The plastic explosives were fairly stable but storing them in a residential area carried a significant risk to live. 'If the quantity of one of the P4 plastic explosives were initiated, it would cause significant damage to buildings and properties nearby. 'If the entire quantity  were initiated the number of casualties and damage would be substantial.' Mr O’Brien Quinn said Morris claimed the plastic explosive sticks and detonators came into her possession when she served with the Royal Engineers between 1983 and 1992. She told police she had panicked and buried the explosives in woodland near her barracks in Wiltshire but returned 20 years later. Morris then claims to have hypnotised herself to find them before driving home with the weapons in her car. Brian Dean, defending, said the defendant had accumulated the bullets and ammunition between 1994 and 1996 when she was a member of a gun club in mid-Wales. He said she had 'accidentally taken leftover rounds home' and had stored them in the loft before panicking when she realised they were still there last year. Morris's wife, Karen, has stood by her husband throughout the trial, he added. 'She has been married since 1988 and is still together with her wife who has been supportive of her for 26 years. 'She has had transgender issues since childhood. She has been on hormone replacements since 2000. The property is a stone's throw from Bloxwich Police Station. Morris will spend three-and-a-half years in a male prison . 'She has a powerful desire to live and be recognised as a woman. She is a quiet, private person who is shy in company. 'She keeps herself to herself and finds it hard to go out because of the looks and stares she attracts. 'Joanne Morris is a gentle soul and this obsession has not and is never likely to be something which would cause anyone else any harm.' Morris reached the rank of Lance Corporal and served in the Falklands and Belize before leaving the Royal Engineers in 1992. She then worked as a medic in the Territorial Army before training as a nurse in the cardiac intensive care unit at New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton, West Mids., from 2003. Morris left the profession for a year after she was attacked by a patient in 2009 before returning to work at an NHS ambulance call centre. Detective Sergeant Craig Newey, of West Midlands Police, said after the hearing: 'Chemical warfare protection suits and ration packs were found at the address. 'One hypothesis was that Morris was preparing for some kind of World War III ""doomsday"" scenario. 'Whatever the motivation, Morris’ military obsession on leaving the army had clearly reached dangerous levels - but that threat was swiftly nullified thanks to the joint efforts of borders staff, police and the bomb disposal unit.'","Joanne Morris was jailed for seven years after police swooped on her home .

"By . Gemma Mullin for MailOnline . Josephine Browne, 50, walked free from court today after she was cleared of spanking her colleague on the backside 'six times' at a London . A police community support officer has walked free from court after she was cleared of repeatedly spanking a male colleague on the bottom and spying on him getting changed. Josephine Browne, 50, was accused of sexual assault and common assault after allegedly slapping her co-worker on the backside six times leaving marks at a London police station. Browne was said to have developed an ‘unhealthy’ interest with the young officer and was purportedly exposed her bra to him, offered to massage him and behaved provocatively towards him in a lift. She denied the allegations throughout the three-day trial at Southwark Crown Court and yesterday a jury took less than an hour to clear her of the sexual assault charge – and today she was cleared of the remaining charge. Judge Deborah Taylor discharging her criticised the way the incident had been investigated by police. She said: ‘As far as the prosecution of this matter is concerned may I just say that the initial investigation by the officer who gave evidence in this court was particularly unsatisfactory and that should be passed back to those concerned. ‘The fact that he invited the complainant to seek support from other officers rather than take responsibility gives great cause for concern from someone of his experience.’ Peter Ryan, a retired police sergeant and Browne’s former boss, confessed he had asked the ‘tearful’ complainant to seek support from other officers on the team after he was informed of the allegations. Giving evidence Browne, of Regents Park, London, had denied spanking her colleague and said: ‘That is not something I would do to somebody in or out of duty.’ She said there was ‘banter’ with her colleagues but strenuously denied touching the complainant or trying to seduce him. Her accuser compared the alleged peeping tom incident as ‘like something out of Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho movie’ and said he felt more comfortable dealing with criminals. He said the spanking incident, alleged to have occurred whilst he carried a filing cabinet through the building with a colleague, was ‘the final straw.’ But Browne remained adamant and said: ‘At no point have I sexually assaulted him or any member of that group,’ she said. ‘The only thing I have done is put my hands on someone’s shoulders but not in a sexual way. Pictured outside Southwark Crown Court yesterday, Browne was said to have developed an ‘unhealthy’ interest with the young officer and accused of exposeing her bra to him, offering a massage and behaving provocatively . ‘I would say something like “Oh, hello boys” in a jokey way because we had a bit of banter. ‘Maybe it is not wise exactly but no-one has ever come to me and said “please don’t do that”.’ Defence counsel Tessa Shroff asked jurors to consider if they believed the former gardener could be a ‘sex offender’. Ms Shroff also highlighted inconsistencies in the evidence of a fellow PCSO and the alleged victim. In one instance they both blamed Browne for an incident in February when she had not started with the team until April. ‘The sad fact is that people do make false allegations,’ said Ms Shroff. She denied the allegations throughout  three-day trial at Southwark Crown Court and yesterday a jury took less than an hour to clear her of the sexual assault charge – and today she was cleared of the remaining charge . Browne had confessed that she did not get on with the other PCSO although she thought she had a good relationship with the complainant. ‘She appeared to me to me to be an unhappy person. She didn’t like me, I’m not saying it is the only reason but I think she was a lady with issues,’ she said. The other PCSO claimed she heard the ‘spanking’ and that Browne’s face had turned red with the exertion. She said Browne had ‘underlying issues that need addressing’ but denied wanting to oust Browne from the team.","Josephine Browne, 50, was accused of sexual assault and common assault .

"By . Annabel Grossman for MailOnline . A British fisherman made the catch of a lifetime while on a fishing holiday in Canada. Peter Starbuck, 78, from Oswestry, Shropshire, travelled to British Columbia  to catch salmon, but stunned locals when he ended up reeling in a 350lb sturgeon. The giant fish was so heavy that it towed his boat for half an hour before the pensioner was able to pull his catch in. 'It looked like a scene from Jaws': The 78-year-old is more used to catching trout with his fly rod, but managed to hang on while the giant sturgeon towed his boat for over an hour. Canadian guide Steve Kaye couldn't believe the catch and  snapped a picture before Peter released the giant back into the water. Mr Starbuck said: 'It looked like a scene from Jaws! 'It was the second time we went out, just myself and the guide, and I caught a fish after an hour. 'I could feel it getting more weight on the line and thought maybe I'd caught a big one. 'Steve said we'd bring it in, and he cut off some of the line so we could pull it in. It towed us down the river for an hour and eventually it got close enough that we could beat it. 'It was actually like being in the gym on the weight machine, and you think you're going to do 20 reps, but the fish was saying you get off when I tell you. It's pulling on your back and also really your whole body. You have to be aware of not being pulled off the boat.' Mr Starbuck, who runs his own business, started fishing in the early 1970s. After fly fishing for trout for 20 years he moved on to fishing for salmon. Although on a salmon-fishing trip in British Colombia, Mr Starbuck took some time out to travel to the Fraser River to try his hand at catching white sturgeon, a freshwater fish species native to North America. The fish are known to reach a maximum weight of more than 1,500lb and can grow up to 20ft long. Mr Starbuck added: 'It was really that exciting. It was a marvellous experience and this time I can tell the story of the one that didn't get away. 'My dream was to get on about my own weight – that was my fantasy. 'When it turned out to be 25 stone I couldn't believe it. 'I went to British Columbia two years ago to catch salmon, last year I went back and someone suggested I should try fishing for sturgeon, and this year I decided to give it a go. 'After this I'm definitely planning to go back next year!'","Peter Starbuck from Shropshire reeled in a 350lb white sturgeon while fishing in Canada .

"By . Sally Lee for Daily Mail Australia . and Australian Associated Press . Disturbing similarities are being drawn between Breaking Bad and one of Australia's states as Victoria battles an ice epidemic. Victorian parliamentary drug committee member David Southwick says the show could become a reality, reported the ABC. This comes after recent studies show deaths from methamphetamines have more than doubled within five years as Victorian drug users increasingly turn to ice. Scroll down for video . US television series Breaking Bad, which features ice manufacturer Walter White (pictured), is coming to life in Victoria . Deaths from methamphetamines have more than doubled within five years in Victoria . Mr Southwick says Breaking Bad, which featured science teacher Walter White who produces and sells methamphetamine to fund his cancer treatment, is 'coming to life'. 'Breaking Bad, that is being held up as sensationalised is effectively playing out on our streets,' he said. Victoria recorded 166 deaths where methamphetamines were a factor last year, up from 66 in 2009. A report from A Current Affair on Wednesday showed how a young mum who had just been tested positive to methamphetamine. She stood with her child at her hip after being caught driving a car under the influence whilst on a busy Victorian road. But police say the 32-year-old's case isn't one that's isolated as she is among many ice-using drivers being busted every day in Victoria. A parliamentary inquiry also found related ambulance call-outs, and emergency department presentations, surged alongside the rising popularity of ice. 'The purity of crystal methamphetamine has also increased over the past two years, which exaggerates the drug's harmful effect,' Simon Ramsay, chair of the Law Reform, Drugs and Crime Prevention Committee, said on Wednesday. 'It's a drug that takes no prisoners in terms of its addictiveness.' The committee's report says just two per cent of the Victorians use methamphetamines and, among this group, men aged 20 to 29 were most likely to be using ice. Overdose, suicide and fatal road crashes were the most common causes of death for ice users. The ice problem was not confined to metropolitan areas, with rural towns also showing big increases in related harms. Glamorisation in the media was also a factor, Mr Southwick said, pointing to ice's role in Breaking Bad. 'It has been built up by television shows like Breaking Bad, and there is almost a hero-type mentality around it,' Mr Southwick said. 'We need to send a very clear message out to the community that this drug is a dirty drug, and it is being marketed quite the opposite even by its name.' The Victorian government is considering the report's 54 recommendations, which include mirroring a successful New Zealand initiative to set up a premier-led ministerial council on ice. Premier Denis Napthine announced $4.5 million funding to roll out roadside drug testing capability to all highway patrol cars in Victoria, and $1.6 million to train up 11 additional drug sniffer dogs. The inquiry described the synthetic substances the most potent of the amphetamine class of drugs which consequently has a stronger effect on the central nervous system. 'It is generally stronger, more addictive and has more harmful side effects than the powder form of the drug known as 'speed',' the report said.","A Victorian drug committee member David Southwick says the show is 'coming to life'

"By . Emma Glanfield for MailOnline . A hunt member has been arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm after a protester was left with seven broken ribs and a punctured lung when 'his horse trampled her' at a hunt. The 42-year-old woman was left seriously injured when she was allegedly hit by the horse at the Blackmore and Sparkford Vale meet in Somerset last Thursday evening. Police said they are treating the incident as a criminal assault and said the hunt member did not stop after the incident. The 42-year-old woman suffered seven broken ribs and a suspected punctured lung after allegedly being hit by a hunt members horse during a 'cubbing' meeting by the Blackmore and Sparkford Vale group in Somerset . The woman was treated at the scene by paramedics (above) before being taken to Yeovil District Hospital . The woman suffered seven broken ribs and a suspected punctured lung and was taken to Yeovil District Hospital. Hunt saboteurs at the scene claim the alleged incident was caught on video from a camera mounted on a vehicle. The Hunts Saboteurs Association said the woman was with another protester 'on a public road' when she was hit from behind and dragged along the ground. The joint master of the hunt, Mike Felton, said members were 'very upset and deeply concerned' that she was injured while the hunt was out. He said: 'We as a hunt and as individuals deeply regret any accident or incident that happens to anyone who is hurt. There is a police investigation so I can't say much about it.' The hunt was meeting near its base and kennels at Charlton Horethorne near Wincanton close to the Dorset-Somerset border. The 42-year-old woman was left seriously injured when she was allegedly hit by the horse at the Blackmore and Sparkford Vale meet in Somerset. Pictured: A previous meet held by the group unrelated to this incident . The incident occurred on Water Lane, Charlton Horethorne in Somerset and left the woman seriously injured . The hunt and its pony club, which consisted of around 60 riders, was met by protesters from the Dorset Hunt Saboteur group. Saboteurs attend the planned hunts in a bid to raise awareness of animal cruelty and use two main tactics to throw the hunt off course. One tactic is to cover the scent of a fleeing fox by using citronella (an essential oil) which stops the hounds from knowing which direction the animal has escaped. The other tactic is to use calls - either voice calls, hunting horns or a  small handheld device with an mp3 player attached - which calls them away from chasing the fox. Jay Tiernan, spokesman for Stop the Cull, said the incident had come as a ‘massive shock to everyone’. He said: ‘It’s a massive shock. It’s difficult to see someone who you care for ending up in hospital. ‘By being a saboteur you are in a particularly dangerous environment and there are several people who are injured every year. ‘There is a lot of anger out there, if there isn’t a successful prosecution what will happen to that hunt member?' She was taken to Yeovil District Hospital (pictured) with seven broken ribs and a suspected punctured lung . Avon and Somerset Police confirmed an investigation had been launched into the incident. A  spokesman said: 'We've started an investigation after a woman was significantly injured after being hit by a ridden horse on Water Lane, Charlton Horethorne. 'An investigation began as soon as this incident was reported to us and at this time is being treated as a criminal assault. 'As part of this work we have a copy of some video showing the incident.' The spokesman added that the man attended a local police station at the weekend and was arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm, interviewed and bailed while further enquiries are carried out.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard for MailOnline . Earth's two largest ice sheets are now dumping an 'incredible' 120 cubic miles of ice into the oceans each year. This is equal to an ice layer 1,970ft (600 metres) thick that would stretch over an area half the size of London, researchers claim. Overall, the rate of ice loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet has doubled. Meanwhile the rate of volume loss from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet has tripled since 2009. The team has produced elevation models for the ice sheets. In Antarctica, the volume of ice loss is about 31 cubic miles (128 cubic km) per year and thinning is concentrated in the area of the Amundsen Sea . The discovery was made using the first ever maps of elevation changes in Greenlandic and Antarctic glaciers created by the Cryosat satellite. A team at Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research used two years' of data collected by Cryosat in 2012 and 2013. They were then able to build 14 million individual height measurements of glaciers for Greenland and another 200 million for Antarctica. The maps reveal that Greenland is now losing about 90 cubic miles (375 cubic km) of ice each year. In Antarctica, the volume of ice loss is about 31 cubic miles (128 cubic km) per year and thinning is concentrated in the area of the Amundsen Sea. The rate of ice loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet has doubled (right), and the rate of volume loss from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (left) has tripled since 2009. Pictured above are the surface slopes of the ice sheets . The maps reveal that Greenland is now losing about 90 cubic miles (375 cubic km) of ice each year. The discovery was made using the first ever maps of elevation changes in Greenlandic and Antarctic glaciers . However, some thickening has been seen in the Dronning Maud Land, where colossal snowfalls have been reported. The scientists claim, however, that this snow fall is not enough to offset the losses in West Antarctica. 'The contribution of both ice sheets together to sea level rise has doubled since 2009,' said Angelika Humbert from Germany's Alfred Wegener Institute. 'To us, that's an incredible number,' she told Jonathon Amos at BBC News. CryoSat was launched in 2010 and uses a radar instrument to measure the shape of polar ice surfaces. 'The new elevation maps are snapshots of the current state of the ice sheets, added Dr Veit Helm, glaciologist at the Alfred Wegener Institute . In Antarctica, the volume of ice loss is about 31 cubic miles (128 cubic km) per year and thinning is concentrated in the area of the Amundsen Sea . 'The elevations are very accurate, to just a few metres in height, and cover close to 3.8 million miles2 (16 million km2) of the area of the ice sheets.' Launched in 2010, CryoSat carries a radar altimeter that can 'see' through clouds and in the dark, providing continuous measurements over areas like Antarctica. The radar can measure the surface height variation of ice in fine detail, allowing scientists to record changes in its volume with unprecedented accuracy. 'Although we are fortunate to now have, in CryoSat-2, a routine capability to monitor the polar ice sheets, the increased thinning we have detected in West Antarctica is a worrying development.' Said Professor Andrew Shepherd, of the University of Leeds. 'It adds concrete evidence that dramatic changes are underway in this part of our planet, which has enough ice to raise global sea levels by more than a metre [3.3 feet].' A flourishing ecosystem has been found a mile and a half beneath Antarctic ice in a lake cut off from the outside world for millions of years. The discovery was made by US scientists who found tiny organisms that generate energy for growth from the natural ammonium and methane in the environment. This is the first direct evidence that life can be found deep below the Antarctic ice sheet and could have implications for finding life in extreme environments in our solar system. 'We were able to prove unequivocally to the world that Antarctica is not a dead continent,’ said lead scientist Professor John Priscu, from Montana State University. Many of the organisms found belong to a primitive extended family of microbes, distinct from bacteria, called the Archaea. Archaea form one of the three great 'domains' of life on Earth, the other two being bacteria and eukayotes - organisms with their DNA contained in a cell nucleus - to which humans belong.","Greenland and Antarctica are dumping 120 cubic miles of ice each year .

"By . Frank Coletta for Daily Mail Australia . He's the Australian aid worker who gave up a lucrative business as an electrician in Queensland to save children from the sex trade across Asia. In just over 10 years, Tony Kirwan, 43, has overseen the rescue of more than 2000 people from sex slavery and human trafficking, most of whom are placed in care programs by his charity, Destiny Rescue. Even though they have successfully removed up to 100 children from brothels and dozens more from slavery - he's far from satisfied. Scroll down for video . Tony Kirwan packed up a thriving small business in north Queensland to start Destiny Rescue. He believes his teams around Asia will rescue upwards of 800 children from child sex slavery this year . 'We're a lot better than we were and we are always finding quicker ways to get the kids out of horrific situations,' said Mr Kirwan, who now is based in Thailand. 'It's not an easy process, it's not as simple as walking in there taking a child by the hand and walking out, unfortunately.' He says the involvement of families and planning what to do for the young boys and girls going forward, is all part of an often tricky process. Tony Kirwan's goal is to remove at least 800 children from sex slavery and prostitution this calendar year . 'We are finding quicker ways to get the kids out of horrific situations' says Destiny Rescue founder Tony Kirwan . Destiny Rescue team members are now directly involved in raids by anti-trafficking police across several parts of Asia, leading to the arrest of brothel owners and the closure of their businesses. 'Our vision is to end child slavery in our lifetime. If we want to change that, we need more people to come on board.' Currently they focus primarily on Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and India but the plan (see graph) is to extend the program, with clear goals set. Children they've removed from predators have been as young as five. Offices are expected in China within the next two years. Countries in orange are where Destiny Rescue is currently in operation, those highlighted in grey are some of those planned to be established by 2019. Up to half a million children are believed to be exploited in Haiti alone and reportedly more than 3 million people are enslaved in China . His colleagues tell how Tony's grand plan is a triumph of the human spirit but he says it had its beginnings from a very spiritual moment. 'One day I had lunch with a mate of mine and, for whatever reason, we got all deep and meaningful,' he said. 'For me, it was a real God moment and the first time I thought I had to be hands on.' The challenge after children are removed from their captors is to reunite them with family and reintegrate them with their community through education and employment programs . A trip to Cambodia with his father 'opened my eyes' to the overwhelming level of poverty. He and his young family packed up and made the move to Thailand where he and his wife volunteered at a mission. While there, they were told a story by a man who'd been visiting Bangkok and was openly offered very young children for sex for $400. That was the moment, according to Tony Kirwan. 'It really hit me and I knew I had to do something,' he said and so began Destiny Rescue. Tony Kirwan plans to have Destiny Rescue operations in place in several more locations within the next two years . One of Destiny Rescue's recent success stories has been Srey Toun, who was 15 when removed from her Cambodian village. Srey, an only child, was raped at knife-point in her family home. Her parents approached the village chief, only to find out her attacker had bribed the town leader and no action would be taken. Worse, to try and make the problem go away, villagers insisted that she should marry her attacker. 'Out of shame to her family, Srey tried to commit suicide,' Mr Kirwan added. 'Her family were destitute but her aunty had heard about Destiny Rescue and asked us to help. 'She didn't want to leave but had little option. 'It's not an easy process, it's not as simple as walking in there taking a child by the hand and walking out, unfortunately' Tony Kirwan says a detailed plan is needed before and after a person is rescued . 'We help rescue the sexually exploited and enslaved, restore the abused, protect the vulnerable, empower the poor and are a voice for children that can’t speak up for themselves,' says Destiny Rescue President, Tony Kirwan . Many of those saved by Destiny Rescue have gone on to start their own businesses . 'Three years on, she has finished her Khmer language studies, completed a course at sewing school and is married.' Srey now has a small sewing business in Phnom Penh and employs four other 'Destiny' girls. 'When I was in my village I was a nasty, angry girl, and Destiny has taught me about a lot of things,' Srey said. 'It has taught me how to talk, how to be strong and respect. 'Other girls should know that can face their problems, to stand up, be strong.' The UN reports that 'every country in the world is affected by human trafficking, whether as a country of origin, transit or destination for victims' Mr Kirwan says the reasons for children being sold into slavery or taken into prostitution are varied, ranging from poverty to gambling problems, as well as a lack of education or abuse at home. Identifying and then removing the child is just the first phase of the Destiny Rescue operation, 'the challenge after that is trying to give them some semblance of a normal life'. Destiny Rescue is setting a goal of 100,000 rescued children by 2020 .","Tony Kirwan was working as an electrician in north Queensland when he quit his lucrative job to establish Destiny Rescue in 2001 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A British student’s field trip has spawned the discovery of a new frog. Samuel Penny, who is doing a Master’s at Bristol University, was studying the amphibians on the island of Madagascar, off East Africa, when he made the finding. The tree frog is green with red speckles on its head and back. Adults are between two and three centimetres long, and a total of 56  were found. Samuel Penny, who is doing a Master's at Bristol University, was studying the amphibians on the island of Madagascar, off East Africa, when he found the Boophis ankarafensis . The new species has been named Boophis ankarafensis as it was found on the banks of the hidden streams of the Ankarafa Forest in Madagascar, pictured . The finding was unveiled in a report by Mr Penny and Kent University scientists in the journal Zoo Keys. Mr Penny said: 'This brightly coloured tree frog has a distinctive advertisement call so by placing sound recorders at potential breeding sites, I could plot its distribution across a wide area of the Sahamalaza Peninsula. 'This also provided detailed information on acoustic variation between individuals and on how its calling pattern changed throughout the night.' The new species has been named Boophis ankarafensis as it was found on the banks of the hidden streams of the Ankarafa Forest. The males were found calling from vegetation around 0.5 to 2m high. They were often within close proximity to each another and positioned on different leaves of the same plant. The new species is described in a paper published in the journal Zoo Keys, co-authored by Mr Penny and an international team of scientists, headed by Dr Goncalo Rosa of Kent University’s Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology. The tree frog is green with red speckles on its head and back. Adults are between two and three centimetres long, and a total of 56  were found on the banks of the hidden streams of the Ankarafa Forest . Dr Rosa said: 'Despite its conspicuous call - a triple click, compared to the usual double, Boophis ankarafensis has not been detected from other surveys of north west Madagascar and it is likely to be a local endemic to the peninsula. 'Although occurring inside a National Park, this species is highly threatened by the continuing decline in the quality and extent of its habitat. 'Due to these threats it is proposed that this beautiful new species should be classified as critically endangered according to the IUCN Red List criteria.'","Samuel Penny is completing a Master's degree at Bristol University .

"By . Stephanie Linning for MailOnline . A team of British scientists has discovered tunnels that are almost as tall as the Eiffel Tower under an ice shelf in Antarctica. Researchers from a number of UK universities and the British Antarctic Survey - a research centre based on the continent - detected the tunnels when they flew a plane over the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf in West Antarctica. Radar from the plane, as well as satellite photos, revealed that ridges and cavities on the surface of the ice sheet corresponded to tunnels lying at its base. British scientists discovered the tunnel using radar from the specially-modified plane. It revealed that ridges and cavities on the surface of the ice corresponded to 820-foot-high tunnels hidden at the base of the sheet . The 820-foot tunnels are nearly as tall as the Eiffel Tower - which measures just over 987 feet - and more than four times as tall as Tower Bride - which comes in at 213 feet. Researchers concluded that the placement of the tunnels means that they were most likely  formed from meltwater - water released from melting ice - that flowing underneath the ice sheet, over land, and into the ocean. The data revealed that water moved beneath the ice in concentrated channels, similar to rivers. Scientists previously thought that meltwater flowed underneath ice sheets in more evenly-spread, thin, continuous sheets. Researchers used a specially-modified Twin Otter aircraft to make the discovery. The plane, designed to operate in remote environment, was fitted with remote sensors that provided scientists with data on the land, ice and sea that it flew over. Scientists from the British Antarctic Survey Base and researchers from a number of UK universities made the discovery at the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf in West Antarctica. Pictured: A British Antarctic Survey base . A British Antarctic Survey Twin Otter aircraft, similar to the one pictured, was equipped with special radar equipment that provided scientists with data on the land, ice and sea that it flew over . The data revealed that water moved beneath the ice in concentrated channels, similar to rivers. Scientists had previously thought that meltwater moved in more evenly spread sheets of water . Specially-designed radar equipment . deciphered the tunnels under the ice - it can also be used to pick out . layers within the ice itself.

"By . Paul Donnelley for MailOnline . The largest outbreak of the deadly disease Ebola was caused by an infected bat biting a toddler say a group of international researchers. The 17-strong team of European and African tropical disease researchers, ecologists and anthropologists have spent three weeks investigating the outbreak of the disease in Guinea, Liberia, Ivory Coast and Nigeria. The researchers captured the bats and other creatures near the village of Meliandoua in remote eastern Guinea, where the present epidemic began in December 2013. Scroll down for video . Most of the previous outbreaks have been caused by meat from dead infected animals collected by hunters who then sell it on. Fruit bats, however, are widely eaten in rural west Africa – either smoked, grilled or in a spicy soup . The boy was bitten and passed the infection on to his mother and both were dead within a week. The disease was then spread far and wide by mourners who came to the funeral. Scientists have long believed that bats are the main carriers for the disease but it is rare for them to pass it on to man. Most of the previous outbreaks have been caused by meat from dead infected animals collected by hunters who then sell it on. Fruit bats, however, are widely eaten in rural west Africa – either smoked, grilled or in a spicy soup. The team lead by epidemiologist Fabian Leendertz, a disease ecologist at the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin, are expected to publish their results in a major journal soon. Initial research believed that a new strain of Ebola had emerged in west Africa but according to Herr Leendertz the strain of the disease is one related to as Zaire ebolavirus, identified more than 10 years ago in the Congo. Straw-coloured fruit bats taking off from largest colony on Earth in Kasanka National Park, Zambia. Herr Leendertz’s team believe that an infected straw-coloured fruit bat brought the disease to Guinea. The mammals are known to travel long distances and usually settle in forests near cities. More than 1,300 people have died in the current epidemic many in Liberia. Herr Leendertz said: ""We spent eight days in Meliandoua. They told us they regularly catch bats, like every other village in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. The evidence is not 100 per cent and we can only say that it is possible. ‘They can travel far in one night. I don't think an individual bat or colony migrated all the way from Congo or Gabon to west Africa. These big colonies are connected. There is a possibility for the virus to mix between colonies. [The bats] share the same fruit. It is likely not to have even been one species of bat. The virus may jump from one species to another."" If the bat theory confirmed, locals would try to destroy the colonies which says Herr Leendertz ‘would be an ecological disaster because bats pollinate plants and devour insects. And bat hunts would also only increase human contact with potentially infected animals.""","Epidemic began in December 2013 near village of Meliandoua in eastern Guinea .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan for MailOnline . A proposal to fire 'missiles' into the surface of Mars packed with probes rather than explosives is seeking $250,000 (£149,500) in funding. The mission known as ExoLance is aiming to provide a cheap and simple way to find out what is underneath the surface of the red planet. And the scientists hope their vessels will be taken by future spacecraft to Mars with a view to performing the deepest search for life on Mars yet. Scroll down for video . A team of scientists from the non-profit group Explore Mars have come up with a proposal that they say could find life beneath the surface of the red planet. Called ExoLance, the mission would fire missiles at the surface and bury experiments underground . 'Is there life on Mars? 'We don't know, but we do know that Mars has all the elements required for life,' the team writes on their Indiegogo page. 'Explore Mars, Inc. has a new mission concept designed to answer that question. 'It is called ExoLance, and it is engineered to look below the surface of Mars for current microbial life.' The proposal comes from the non-profit group Explore Mars based in Beverly, Massachusetts. Amongst its team includes Dr Gilbert Levin, who previously led an experiment on one of Nasa’s 1976 Viking Mars landers that he was certain found evidence of life, although Nasa disagreed. Now he and the rest of the team are hoping to prove once and for all that the red planet is habitable with their ambitious proposal. If funding is reached, the team hopes to build prototypes in 12 to 14 months and test them at a range in the New Mexico desert. 'Many areas of the Mojave Desert feature Mars-like characteristics,' they write. 'There, we will be able to test both the delivery system (from an aircraft) as well as the ground penetrating arrows. 'These tests will verify the average depth of penetration as well as testing the necessary parameters for a viable life detection experiment within the arrows.' Once the concept has been sufficiently tested the team plans to approach Nasa and other space agencies and ask them to carry ExoLance on one or more future Mars missions. Exolance would be carried to Mars by another spacecraft. The mission could comprise several penetrator probes, known as 'Arrows', that would be held in a 'Quiver' on the carrier vehicle, which would safely transport them through the atmosphere (artist's illustration shown) Once through the atmosphere the lander carrying the Quiver would deploy its parachute and begin its gradual descent to the surface, at which point the Arrows would be released to various locations . The Arrows would bury initially to about 6.5 feet (two metres). Using a drill, however, they could bury to a total depth of 16.5 feet (five metres) where life detection equipment would be deployed . ‘Exolance incorporates a delivery system that was originally designed for military purposes,’ the team writes on their website. The mission would use a series of small lightweight penetrator probes called ‘Arrows’ that would take life detection equipment underground. They would do this by impacting the surface at high speeds after being released from a carrier spacecraft. A series of Arrows the company calls a ‘Quiver’ would be integrated into a lander and released as it makes its way to the surface. Within each impactor would be experiments at the tip and communications equipment at the back so it could relay information to an orbiting spacecraft and then back to Earth. The Arrows would also have a drilling capability allowing them to dig down to a total of 16.5ft (five metres). Each missile, known as an Arrow, has a hardened penetrator on the front end and has a set of fins on the back end. The middle of the probe is a cylinder that splits into two pieces when the arrow impacts the surface. The first piece stays with the penetrator and burrows into the Martian surface to a depth of up to 6.5 feet (two metres) This piece contains the life detection experiment in a small cylinder behind the penetrator. This ‘metabolic test’ could distinguish between non-living chemistry and living microorganisms. The team says if it detects life the experiment could determine if it is related to Earth life or is a new strain. The second piece stays on the surface, where the fins act as stops to prevent it from going down into the hole. This piece houses the radio equipment that sends the signals back to an orbiting relay on one of the existing Mars orbiters. Once successfully deployed, the life detection experiment begins. By deploying multiple probes, data sampling is expanded to multiple sites, which improves the science and reliability. Having multiple probes allows for individual probe failures without losing the entire mission. This . concept borrows from several engineering designs already in practice. The penetrator design is based on military ‘bunker buster’ technology. The split segments concept was pioneered by Nasa in the late 1990’s on the Deep Space 2 mission. The team hopes to begin testing the concept in the Mojave Desert next year. This location, they say, features Mars-like characteristics that will allow the concept to be tested to an adequate degree. This will be phase 1 of the tests - phase 2 will be to test the microbial life detection experiments. The . team says that a number of upcoming Mars missions, including Nasa’s . 2016 Insight mission and Esa’s 2018 ExoMars mission, could carry . Exolance. Nasa's Curiosity rover (artist's illustration shown) is currently on Mars trying to ascertain if the red planet was or still is habitable. The Exolance team hope that their mission can be incorporated on a future Mars mission such as Nasa's Insight in 2016 or Esa's Exomars in 2018.","Scientists are seeking funding for novel proposal to find life on Mars .

"It was described as 'incredibly important' and of 'global importance,' but now archaeologists have discovered that a mysterious tomb in Greece was plundered in antiquity. Experts had hoped that the ancient mound in northern Greece contained the untouched remains of an important senior official from the time of Alexander the Great, as well as possible treasures. But now it appears that signs of forced entry outside the huge barrel-vaulted structure, indicate the tomb was emptied long ago. Scroll down for video . Archaeologists were hopeful that an ancient mound in northern Greece could hold the remains of a senior official from the time of Alexander the Great. They discovered that its entrance is guarded by a pair of sphinxes (pictured) but now say that signs of forced entry indicate it was plundered in antiquity . Archeologists entered the underground structure earlier this week and The Culture Ministry said that it appears to have been looted in antiquity. At 1,935ft (590m) wide, it is the largest burial of its kind ever discovered in Greece. Experts had partially investigated the antechamber of the tomb at the Kasta Tumulus site near ancient Amphipolis in Macedonia, Greece, and uncovered a marble wall concealing one or more inner chambers. They said that a hole in the decorated wall and signs of forced entry indicate it was plundered, but excavations will continue for weeks to make sure. The tomb dates between 325 BC - two years after the death of ancient . Greek warrior-king Alexander the Great - and 300 BC. Its discovery and a . visit there by Greece's prime minister sparked extensive . speculation on its contents. Earlier this week, photographs emerged of a pair of sphinxes guarding the grave's entrance beneath a large arch and Greece’s Culture Ministry said that most of the earth around the mythical creatures had been removed to reveal part of a marble lintel with frescoes. Chief archaeologist Katerina Peristeri, said that the monument being uncovered is a unique tomb, not just for Greece but for the entire Balkanic peninsula, and described it as being of ‘global interest’. Archaeologists . excavating an ancient mound in northern Greece (picutred) uncovered the entrance to an important tomb. It is . believed to have been built at the end of the reign of warrior-king . Alexander the Great and Prime Minister Antonis Samaras described the . discovery as 'extremely important’ Alexander (statue pictured) was born in Pella, the ancient capital of Macedonia in July 356 BC, and died of a fever in Babylon in June 323 BC . Alexander III of Macedon was born in Pella, the ancient capital of Macedonia in July 356 BC. He died of a fever in Babylon in June 323 BC. Alexander led an army across the Persian territories of Asia Minor, Syria and Egypt claiming the land as he went. His greatest victory was at the Battle of Gaugamela, now northern Iraq, in 331 BC, and during his trek across these Persian territories, he was said to never have suffered a defeat. This led him to be known as Alexander the Great. Following this battle in Gaugamela, Alexander led his army a further 11,000 miles (17,700km), founded over 70 cities and created an empire that stretched across three continents. This covered from Greece in the west, to Egypt in the south, Danube in the north, and Indian Punjab to the East. Alexander was buried in Egypt. His fellow royals were traditionally interred in a cemetery near Vergina, far to the west. The lavishly-furnished tomb of Alexander's father, Philip II, was discovered during the 1970s. Prime . Minister Antonis Samaras, who visited the tightly-guarded site two weeks . ago, said the discovery ‘is clearly extremely important’. Alexander, . who started from the northern Greek region of Macedonia to build an . empire stretching as far as India, died in 323 B.C. and was buried in . Egypt. His fellow royals were traditionally interred in a cemetery near Vergina, to the west, where the lavishly-furnished tomb of Alexander's father, Philip II, was discovered during the 1970s. But archaeologists believe the Amphipolis grave, which is surrounded by a surprisingly long and well-built wall with courses of marble decorations, may have belonged to a senior ancient official. Dr Peristeri has argued the mound was originally topped by a large stone lion that was unearthed a century ago, and is now situated around 3 miles (5km) from the excavation site. Geophysical teams have identified there are three main rooms within the huge circular structure, news.com.au reported. In the past, the lion has been associated with Laomedon of Mytilene, one of Alexander's military commanders who became governor of Syria after the king's death. Greece's culture ministry said that most of the earth around the sphinx statues has now been removed to reveal part of a marble lintel with frescoes (pictured) but hopes of finding further treasures now seem to be slim . The tomb is situated in Amphipolis region of Serres in Greece (marked). Archaeologists believe the grave may have belonged to a senior ancient official. While it looks largely undisturbed, there are fears that looting took place hundreds of years ago . In Greek tradition, the mythical sphinx has the haunches of a lion, sometimes with the wings of a great bird, and the face of a human - usually a woman. It was described by writers as being treacherous and merciless. In many myths, including Oedipus, those who could not answer a riddle posed by the monster, would be killed and eaten. The sphinx described by the Ancient Egyptians was usually male and more benevolent. In both cultures, they often guarded entrances to temples and important tombs. The oldest sphinx found guarding a site was discovered in Turkey and dates to 9,500 BC. ‘The excavation will answer the crucial question of who was buried inside,’ Mr Samaras said. Earlier this week, experts shared their fears that the tomb could have been looted hundreds of years ago. Part of a stone wall that blocked off the subterranean entrance was found to be missing, while the sphinxes, which were originally six feet (2metres) high, lack heads and wings. Near the sphinxes, excavators have found fragments of a large marble lion that originally capped the mound, which they said indicates the site was severely damaged and dug up in later antiquity. Last week The Culture Ministry called for ‘understanding’ while the Amphipolis excavation proceeds. The discovery has sparked global interest and wild speculation that it may contain rich treasures or the bones of an ancient celebrity. ‘It's astonishing, the biggest tomb we have found in Greece so far,’ said archaeologist Chryssoula Paliadelli, an expert on the period who is not involved in the excavation. ‘It clearly shows the wealth that allowed construction of what was, at the time, a hugely costly monument.’ Excavator Katerina Peristeri has argued the mound was originally topped by a large stone lion that was unearthed a century ago, and is now situated around 3 miles (5km) from the excavation site (pictured). The lion has been associated with Laomedon of Mytilene, who was one of Alexander's military commanders .","The tomb is situated in Amphipolis region of Serres in Greece .

"By . Pete D'amato for MailOnline . Despite student loan debt hitting $1trillion this decade, going to college is still the smart thing to do, as the average student makes back the cost of their degree in 10 years, says the New York Fed. Jaison R. Abel and Richard Dietz, economists at the New York Federal Reserve Bank, looked at data on college graduates and found steady growth in earnings over the last few decades. The average value of earning a bachelor's degree instead of only graduating high school has been hovering 'near its all-time high of about $300,000' for around a decade, according to a blog posted on the New York Fed's site Tuesday. Higher ed: Researchers at the New York Federal Reserve found that college graduates earn $300,000 more than high school graduates over their lifetime . Abel and Dietz looked at data going back to 1970 for the study, which was originally published in June. The record earnings took student loan debt into account on the balance, though the researchers acknowledge they did not count jobless or part-time workers with college degrees. Graduates weather bad economies better than the rest, but college graduates experienced their worst unemployment rates in decades during 2010 according to NPR. What's encouraging for students with five- or six-figure debts are findings that a college degree pays off twice as fast as it used to. Back in 1980, it took more than 20 years for a graduate to break even on a college degree. Now the average is around 10. This is in spite of the fact that tuition nearly sextupled from 1985 to 2011 as the New York Times reported. Payoff: Abel and Dietz found that the time it took for a college degree to pay for itself dropped significantly over the past few decades . College students shouldn't take this as a chance to slack. In a follow-up, Abel and Dietz explained that in addition to paying tuition, those who take an extra year to complete their bachelor's degree lose out on $37,000 in wages and earn $41,000 less over their lifetime. Students who spend a sixth year can kiss $144,000 goodbye. The returns on investment for a bachelor's degree are also not evenly distributed across every field of study. Unsurprisingly, graduates with engineering or math and computer science degrees experienced the highest rates of return. The lowest was education, where the average graduate's income amounted to nine percent return, only slightly better than investing those tuition dollars into the stock market.","Jaison R.

The full moon was a bright presence in the London night sky and many lit up many of the capital's greatest buildings and monuments, including the Shard, pictured . A supermoon occurs when the moon is both 'full' and at its closest point to Earth. Astronomers call this phenomenon a 'perigee moon,' which describes the full moon that occurs when the moon is at its closest point to Earth each year. Perigee marks the closest point a body reaches as it orbits around its host object such as Earth, while apogee marks the farthest point from its parent body. Almost every orbit has an apogee and perigee because orbits tend to be elliptical rather than perfectly circular, so even Earth has an apogee and perigee around the sun.

"By . Reuters . and Ted Thornhill for MailOnline . The death toll from an outbreak . of the Ebola virus in the Djera region of northern Democratic . Republic of Congo (DMC) has risen to 31 people, as on the other side of the continent more than 1,900 people were confirmed to have died. The DMC Government confirmed the 31 deaths today, which are due to a different strain of the disease to the ongoing epidemic in West African nations including Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. Previously, the government said there were 13 dead. Seven healthcare workers are among the dead. The separate outbreak in West Africa has killed more than . 1,900 people since it was first reported in the forests of . southeastern Guinea in March, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said. Precautions: Citizens participate in the cleaning and disinfection campaign  in Bissau, Guinea Bissau, in West Africa . The organisation said the outbreak in Congo, in the remote Boende district around 750 miles from the capital of Kinshasa, was a . 'distinct and independent event, with no relationship to the . outbreak in West Africa'. It said that there were a total of 53 . cases and said health care workers were tracing 160 contacts. A statement from the WHO added: 'These findings are reassuring, as they exclude the possibility that the virus has spread from West to Central Africa.' The Zaire strain of the deadly virus is indigenous to Congo . and there have seven outbreaks in the country since it was first . discovered there in the remote Equateur province in 1976. The first victim of the current Congo outbreak was a . pregnant woman who butchered a jungle animal in the village of . Ikanamongo and died on 11 August.

The outbreak in West Africa has killed more than 1,550 people since it was first reported in the forests of southeastern Guinea in March. Pictured is the clean-up operation in Bissau . Concern: The World Health Organisation (pictured) said that there were a total of 53 cases in Congo and that health care workers were tracing 160 contacts . The WHO explained that the virus finds its way into the human population following contact with infected bushmeant - usually fruit bats or monkeys. Meanwhile, British Ebola survivor William Pooley told today how he feared for his life after catching the deadly virus. The volunteer nurse, 29, has been given the all-clear and discharged from a London hospital, having received the experimental drug ZMapp to combat the disease he contracted in Sierra Leone. He praised the 'world-class' treatment he was given after being evacuated back to the United Kingdom. Medical workers of the John Fitzgerald Kennedy hospital of Monrovia, Liberia, wear their protective suit before going to the high-risk area of the hospital, the surgical section where Ebola patients are being treated . Alarming: Ebola kills in 90 per cent of cases. Pictured is a doctor at the John Fitzgerald Kennedy hospital of Monrovia, Liberia . Mr Pooley, from Suffolk, was flown home by the RAF and cared for in a special unit at the Royal Free Hospital in north London. He told how he had been woken by a doctor in a full protective suit after blood tests proved he had Ebola while working in west Africa. He said: 'I was worried I was going to die. 'I was worried about my family, I was scared.' He said the worst thing had been having to tell his parents that he had Ebola, adding: 'No one wants to upset their parents in that way.' He said he had no regrets about going to an area where the epidemic was rife but said he had no plans for the future at the moment. He joked: 'They incinerated my passport so my mum will be pleased to know I cannot go anywhere at the moment.' Mr Pooley is heading home to Eyke in East Anglia, where his parents Robin and Jackie live, to recuperate with friends and family, he said. He said he was 'wonderfully lucky' to have survived a disease that had killed more than 2,000 people in Africa. Infectious diseases consultant Dr Michael Jacobs, who treated Mr Pooley, said: 'The virus is clear from the body and there is no risk to the wider community in any way.' The disease victim told how he had undergone blood tests after feeling ill in Sierra Leone. He said he went to sleep feeling sick and was woken by a World Health Organisation doctor wearing personal protective equipment after the tests came back positive.","WHO said outbreak in Congo, in Boende, was a 'distinct' event .

It was towed through the Thames Barrier, under Tower Bridge and past the Houses of Parliament on its way to its mooring in Nine Elms on the south bank yesterday. The creature will be positioned at the site until September 28 and will be accessible to the public at low tide. Mr Hofman is best known for his huge rubber duck, which was taken around Europe, North and South America and the Far East before famously deflating in Hong Kong last year. The new artwork was unveiled as part of Totally Thames, a festival celebrating one of Britain's most famous rivers. The animal was first taken through the Thames Barrier in Woolwich, south east London yesterday morning before being towed up through the centre of the capital . The hippo appears from beneath Westminster Bridge next to the Houses of Parliament as tourists crane their necks and take photos of the bizarre object . The sculpture was taken by two tug boats along the famous river, past the O2 Arena in north Greenwich, formerly known as the Millennium Dome . Rotterdam-based Mr Hofman said he was inspired to make the artwork after hearing that hippopotamuses inhabited the Thames in prehistoric times. He added: 'I am thrilled and excited to be using the Thames as the location of my first UK commission. 'The purpose of setting my sculptures in the public domain has always been to give members of the public a break from their daily routines, to inspire conversation and to cause astonishment.' Dolphins and porpoises are regularly seen on the river, with a pod of five spotted last year. In 2004, a piranha landed on a Thames Bubbler boat in Dagenham and in 2009 a sea lamprey, a prehistoric eel-like creature with a sucker-shaped mouth, was found by fishermen. Workers in the Canary Wharf financial district were left shocked as the 68-foot long hippo was towed past the windows of their tower blocks yesterday morning . It was taken to its mooring at Nine Elms, near Battersea Power Station, where it will be on display this month and accessible to the public during low tides . Mr Hofman became famous after his huge rubber duck was towed around the world's harbours .

"By . John Stevens for the Daily Mail . Axed: Nick Clegg will announce the plan today . A tax break for married couples would be scrapped to pay for free childcare for all two-year-olds, under plans from the Liberal Democrats. The married couple’s allowance – worth £200 a year to couples where one partner does not pay income tax – is due to be introduced next year. But Nick Clegg will today announce plans to axe the flagship Conservative policy in the Lib Dem manifesto for next year’s election. Instead the money will be used to help fund 15 hours of free childcare for all two-year-olds. It will extend a government scheme that gives free childcare to all three and four-year-olds, and two-year-olds from families who receive certain benefits. The Deputy Prime Minister will say that the expansion of the scheme is the first step towards delivering the Lib Dems’ longer term plan to extend free childcare to all working parents from the end of parental leave. The Lib Dems admit that scrapping the married couple’s allowance would not cover the whole cost of the £800million childcare plan. According to Treasury figures the tax break will cost £515million a year from its introduction next April, rising to £820million a year by 2018. More than four million married couples are due to benefit from the extension of the married couple’s allowance, announced in this year’s Budget. Chancellor George Osborne said the allowance that can be transferred from one partner to another will rise from £1,000 to £1,050 from April next year. Only those on the basic rate of income tax would be eligible for the allowance. The Lib Dems opposed the allowance in opposition, but in the Coalition agreement agreed to abstain from voting on its introduction. A party source said last night: ‘We’ve never supported it. We believe it is a penalty on unmarried couples. 'People who lose out include widows, people who have lost their husbands in wars, people whose spouses have walked out on them and people who choose not be married. 'We don’t think they should pay higher taxes than those who are married.’ The childcare scheme will be one of more than 300 manifesto policies announced today that will be voted on at Lib Dem conference in Glasgow next month. Policy: The £200-a-year allowance will help couples of whom one member does not pay income tax . Liberal Democrat Business Minister Jo Swinson MP said: ‘Helping families with the cost of childcare is part of the Liberal Democrat plan to build a stronger economy and a fairer society where there is opportunity for everyone to get on in life. ‘Extending free early years education to all two year olds will benefit children and reduce childcare costs for working parents. 'It builds on our record in Government where we have expanded free early years education for every three and four year old and provided it for the first time to two year olds from the most hard pressed families. ‘This is a ultimately a fundamental difference in values. Liberal Democrats want to help all families with childcare support and nursery education right the way through from the end of parental leave to the start of school. 'The Tories are more bothered about helping only some couples through a married couples’ tax break.’ But Lucy Powell MP, Shadow Minister for Childcare and Children, said: ‘There’s no point the Lib Dems making more promises when people remember only too well the promises Nick Clegg and his party have already broken.’ Labour has already said it will scrap tax break if it wins next year’s General Election.","Married couples' allowance will be worth £200 a year to many when it begins .

"By . Julian Robinson for MailOnline . A murder investigation team has taken over the hunt for a missing 14-year-old girl who was last seen walking in the direction of home along a canal tow path. Detectives from Scotland Yard's homicide and major crime squad are now leading the search for Alice Gross, who went missing last week. The teenager, who has health problems, left her home in Hanwell, west London at 1pm on Thursday, telling her parents she would be back that evening, and was seen on CCTV on the Grand Union Canal tow path just over an hour later. Scroll down for video . Detectives from Scotland Yard's homicide and major crime squad are now involved in the search for missing Alice Gross, pictured . Alice Gross was seen on CCTV on the Grand Union Canal tow path in the Brentford Lock area, pictured, an hour after leaving her home in West London . She was filmed alone, walking near the Holiday Inn at Brentford Lock, heading towards the Thames at 2.23pm. And investigators now say she was seen at the same point on the tow path at 3.45pm going back towards Hanwell. Detective Chief Inspector Andy Chalmers said it was 'a matter of course' that the investigation had been taken over by the Homicide and Major Crime Command (HMCC). He said: 'It is not unusual in circumstances such as this for the HMCC to provide additional expertise and a fresh perspective to support and progress the investigation. 'I would like to stress that there is no change to the status of this investigation. This is and continues to be treated as a missing person's inquiry and our involvement is due to the fact that we have a vulnerable missing young girl who needs to be located as a matter of priority. 'I would like to thank the local community and those who have kept the appeal in the public domain by using social media to highlight Alice's disappearance. This has generated a number of leads and I would urge anyone who has any information that has yet to get in contact with us to please do. Alice Gross (pictured), who has health problems, left her home at 1pm on Thursday, telling her parents she would be back that evening . 'In particular I would like to speak with anyone who may have seen Alice on the Grand Union Canal or River Brent tow paths during the afternoon of Thursday August 28.' Scotland Yard said there was nothing to suggest the teenager had come to harm but that the possibility had to be considered as one line of inquiry. The force said in a statement: 'There is no information at this stage to suggest that anything untoward may have happened to Alice but detectives retain an open mind and consideration has been given to the fact that she may have become a victim of crime. 'This is only one line of inquiry but detectives stress that with the HMCC now providing additional resources and expertise to locate Alice they hope to return her home safe and well.' On Monday, Alice's family appealed for information about where she is. Alice's mother Rosalind Hodgkiss, 50, said: 'What I would want to say is whatever she feels, or might have happened, we are not angry with her. We love her, we desperately miss her, we want to support her whatever is going on in her thoughts. Detective Chief Inspector Andy Chalmers said it was 'a matter of course' that the investigation into the disappearance of Alice Gross had been taken over by the Homicide and Major Crime Command . Police and family members launched a major appeal for information following the disappearance of Alice Gross, pictured . 'We don't want to speculate about what might have caused her to go, if that indeed is what has happened. We want her to know how much we love her and miss her. There is a huge hole in everybody's life and we can't believe that she is not here.' The Brentside High School pupil had taken part in a song-writing workshop at the Camden Roundhouse earlier in August and police are trying to trace anyone who befriended her during the course. Alice is white, 5ft 2in and slim, with shoulder length, light brown hair. When she was last seen she was wearing dark blue jeans, a dark green lacy cardigan and denim blue Vans shoes. She may have had tartan-framed glasses with her. Her sister Nina, 19, has set up a Facebook page, Find Alice Gross, to help with the search, and celebrities including Jonathan Ross and Graham Norton have helped publicise the hunt via Twitter.

"By . Josh Gardner for MailOnline . Dangerous or just creative? Authorities in a Maryland school district suspended English teacher Patrick McLaw and some claim it was over fear he'd turn his sci-fi novels about school shootings into reality . A Maryland English teacher is on academic probation after authorities became concerned that he might act out his sci-fi novels about mass shootings. If the novels first tipped authorities off last month about Patrick Wayne McLaw, his 'several aliases' and the model school building he kept in his Wicomico County home got them seriously worried. But the 23-year-old first-year teacher was never arrested, leading some to suggest his treatment is little more than a witch hunt. However, authorities said Tuesday that it's McLaw's mental wellbeing and not threats of violence that had them worried. So why did authorities search the school where McLaw taught eighth grade language arts for bombs before students returned for class last week? '[We] agreed that the prudent thing to do was search for any type of weapons or implements or devices that could be damaging to children,' Sheriff James W. Phillips Jr. told the Baltimore Sun on Tuesday. That decision came after the area school board was told about a man named Dr. K.S. Voltaer, who'd written the novels The Insurrectionist and a sequel called Lillith's Heir. That man also once went by Patrick Beale, whose name was legally changed to Patrick McLaw. Authorities also searched McLaw's home, where he lived with his mother, and they discovered the model school building. The K-9 bomb-sniffing units sent into Mace's Lane Middle School suggest authorities feared McLaw would act out some grim fantasy. However, State's Attorney Matthew A. Maciarello now claims authorities acted out solely out of fear for the teacher's mental health. Evidence? McLaw wrote a book set in the year 2900, as well as a sequel, about a gruesome school shooting under the pen name Dr. K.S. Voltaer . According to the Sun, officials revealed after the search that McLaw had written a letter with 'suicidal undertones' to school higher-ups. McLaw was never arrested. Instead, he was taken in for a psychological evaluation. However, authorities chose not to share all of the details of the case until this week. The tight-lipped authorities gave free speech proponents room to launch a campaign demanding McLaw be reinstated. 'This superstitious demonizing of literature strikes at the heart of our most fundamental liberties,' reads a Change.org petition, which boasts nearly 2,000 posted in support of McLaw. Miciarello has now denied the books had anything to do with the actions of his office. 'It didn't start with the books and it didn't end with the books,' he told the LA Times. 'It's not even a factor in what law enforcement is doing now.' An attorney for McLaw, David Moore, told The LA Times that his client 'is receiving treatment.' Police were concerned enough over a letter McLaw wrote to sweep the middle school where he taught for bombs. However, the State's Attorney later said they feared only for McLaw's mental health and that the letter had 'suicidal undertones'","Authorities in Maryland's Eastern Shore worried about 23-year-old Patrick Wayne McLaw's 'several aliases'

"By . Lucy Thackray for Daily Mail Australia . A horrific night at the movies revealed something far more terrifying than anything on screen, when Brisbane cinema-goers were disgusted to realise they had been sitting on soiled, mouldy seats. Brisbane resident Aaron Parnell said the stained seats at Event Cinemas Garden City were covered in ‘grime and gunk’ – enough to make his ‘sick to the point of throwing up.’ Images show the discoloured chairs, covered in dust and wet patches. The four friends only became aware of the putrid chairs when the lights came on as the credits rolled after a two and a half hour stint in the seats. After the movie was over, the four friends realised they had been sitting in the stained, mouldy chairs for two and a half hours at Event Cinemas Garden City . Mr Parnell's partner developed a rash on her arm and they all felt like they needed to 'scrub themselves thoroughly', concerned about what they'd been exposed to . On the Event Cinemas Garden City Facebook page, Mr Parnell explained that his partner had a skin reaction to the seats. ‘I mean it when I say that I have NEVER in my life seen anything like this in a "" business establishment "". 'Upon driving home, my partner developed a rash on her arm and we all had to jump in the shower and scrub ourselves thoroughly after being exposed to that.' Event Cinemas Garden City replied to the Facebook complaint, explaining that the cinema had been affected by Brisbane's recent rain . The business replied to the post on Facebook, explaining that the cinemas were affected by water damage. ‘Unfortunately due to the recent rain it seems we have developed some mould affecting some of the seats. Thankyou for bringing this to our attention. We have arranged for a special team of cleaners to rectify this problem today,’ Event Cinemas Garden City wrote in response. However, Mr Parnell does not believe this excuse is true. 'It is quite obvious to see that this is not the result of anything recent, this has been left over time, excluded and not attended to,’ Mr Parnell wrote. Mr Parnell argues that the damage is not recent, but has been 'left over time, exclused and not attended to.' Mr Parnell and his friends took their phones out to photograph the disturbing facilities and posted the images on the cinema's Facebook page, to warn other patrons. ‘In the cinema there was rubbish on the floor, rubbish on the seats, grime and gunk and filth all over the floor, seats and the arm rests. It was disgusting,’ said Aaron Parnell. Further inspection of the Facebook page shows similar grievances from more than six months ago, with various cinema goers warning others about the unclean facilities and the ‘sweaty smell.’ ‘Bad day at event cinema garden city gold class cinema 1 stank like sweat soon as we walked in the door changed seats 3 times because they also smell very bad and there flithy have they ever been cleaned ? Sure didn't seem like it not sure what the $25 ticket price is meant to cover it sure wasn't a nice time,’ wrote on member of the public. Facebook posts on the Event Cinemas Garden City Facebook page reveal complaints from patrons from the last six months, expressing their distress at the unclean and 'stinky' state of the facilties. ‘Im sorry to say almost all my visits have been a disappointment due to unclean movie theaters (sic). movies are so expensive these days if you're going to charge so much at least have clean facilities (sic),’ wrote another. Mr Parnell says it’s time Event Cinemas clean their act up, fearing the health of cinema patrons is at risk. 'Mould is a big problem, especially with me with me I’m an asthmatic,' Mr Parnell told Courier Mail. 'God knows how many people have come into contact with it.'","Movie-goers discover they sat in soiled cinema seats for 2.5 hours .

"By . Jennifer Smith for MailOnline . A man attacked his gay flatmate with a hammer, embedding it in his skull as he slept, a court has heard. Connor Huntley, 18, was sleeping when Joseph Williams allegedly launched the attack just hours after the pair settled into a new flat in Margate, Kent. The 30-year-old had previously made 'disparaging comments' about homosexuality, the Old Bailey heard. Connor Huntley (pictured) needed brain surgery after being attacked in the flat he shared with Joseph Williams in Margate . Williams, who told police his mental health had 'deteriorated' after the alleged assault, denies attempted murder and causing grievous bodily harm with intent. Jurors were told Mr Huntley from Dover had been looking forward to moving into the flat after leaving school, and was getting along well with Williams on May 27 last year. ‘He was upbeat - his first night in his own flat away from people’, said Edward Woolley, who helped Mr Huntley move in to the property. ‘He probably felt a bit grown up in his own place.’ ‘They got on like a house on fire. It was like they had been friends for ages. ‘They were telling each other about their childhoods, they seemed quite friendly to me.’ But Mr Woolley's girlfriend, Abbie Smith, told jurors the accused had hinted at violence in the weeks beforehand. The teenager was 'getting along well' with the accused on the day the alleged attack is said to have taken place . ‘He said, just out of the blue, that he couldn't live with Connor because he would end up hitting him. ‘We were not having a conversation about Connor, he just said it,' she told the court. ‘I stuck up for my friend a bit, saying he had done nothing wrong. ‘But that was left at that.’ Mr Huntley was last seen by the couple at 11.30pm on May 27. Williams is thought to have spent the night at the home of his girlfriend. At 5.10am, the accused allegedly sent a text message to his partner to tell her he had had a nice time. Forty minutes later, he sent a series of messages saying 'help', the court heard. At 10.30am Ms Smith tried to visit Mr Huntley, who, it is thought, often wears women's clothing, but that Williams refused her entry. He later phoned 999, telling operators: 'I don’t know how to say this but he’s dead in my flat. I hit him on the head with a hammer in his sleep.’ The trial at the Old Bailey in London (pictured) continues. Williams denies attempted murder and grievous bodily harm with intent . He is alleged to have told them: 'My mental health just deteriorated'. Police arrived to discover the teenager lying on an air bed with the hammer embedded in his skull. He suffered a depressed skull fracture and traumatic brain injury. Yesterday prosecutors claimed Williams had made 'disparaging comments' about homosexuality in the past. Prosecutor Philip Bennetts QC said: 'They were not the obvious flatmates.' 'On the morning of 28 May last year the defendant attacked Mr Huntley with a hammer while Mr Huntley was asleep. There were at least two blows to his head. 'The hammer penetrated his skull and was embedded in his skull. 'The injuries were life threatening at the time but fortunately he survived.'

"By . Nelson Groom For Daily Mail Australia . Uluru is Australia's most expensive holiday destination, and the third most expensive in the world. The latest Hotels Price Index report, which is based on bookings through hotels.com, found the average room in Uluru, in Central Australia, costs $300 a night in the first half of the year, which is a slight increase from $287 last year. The only two popular destinations in the world more expensive than Uluru were New York City at $316 a night, and Rio De Janeiro in Brazil at $302 a night. Uluru, one of the most iconic tourism sites in Australia, had the most expensive hotel costs in the report . Uluru is largely monopolised by Voyages Tourism, a company which owns the majority of hotels in the area . Uluru is home to World Heritage listed red rock, which is one of the nation's most iconic sites. Hotels in Uluru appear to be largely controlled by Voyages Indigenous Tourism, a company which owns five of the five hotels listed in TripAdviser for Uluru and three of the three on Booking.com. Voyages spokesperson Karena Noble told Daily Mail Australia that she questioned the pertinence of the report. 'Bookings through Hotels.com represent a small percentage of the total bookings taken for the Resort, making it an unrepresentative sample.'

Interestingly, the cheapest destination in the report was Alice Springs, a city which is under an hour's flight from Uluru. Alice Springs had an average of $106 a night on the report. Paul Bailey, a spokesperson for Lasseters Hotel in Alice Springs, told Daily Mail Australia: ‘Alice Springs has some of the most expensive flight rates of anywhere in Australia. We try to level that out with the costs of accommodation.’ ‘It’s ironic that Alice Springs has been listed the cheapest holiday destination in Australia, because we just won best Deluxe Accommodation award in the 2013 Australian Tourism awards,’ Mr Bailey said. Paul Bailey said that Lasseters Hotel offers cheap accomodation to offset the relatively large flight costs involved in getting to Alice Springs . The report found American and Chinese tourists tended to pay the most for accommodation in Australia, spending an average of $192 a night. The Holiday Index report comes as Tourism Research Australia's has released it's latest survey, which shows international tourist spending in Australia has risen 7 per cent from the last year to $30.1 billion.","A new price comparison report has found Uluru in Central Australia is the most expensive holiday destination in Australia .

"By . Dan Bloom for MailOnline . Police shot dead an escaped £5,000 bull which was retreating peacefully into a shed, the animal's furious owner has claimed. North Yorkshire Police sent PCSOs, two marksmen and a firearms commander in an armed two-and-a-half hour operation after Billy the Blonde d'Aquitane strayed into a country road. Farmer Philip Marley insisted his bull was being herded calmly back towards a shed when it was shot and slammed the killing as 'outrageous and totally morally wrong'. Furious: Farmer Philip Marley (right) has made a formal complaint to North Yorkshire Police after his prize bull Billy (pictured), a Blonde d'Aquitane worth around £5,000, was shot dead by marksmen on Monday . Mr Marley, who breeds sheep and cattle and has two butcher's shops, added: 'It's as if it was target practice' The 45-year-old claimed police were 'hell-bent' on destroying his prize animal and said: 'It's almost as if it was target practice.' Officers were called just after 11am on Monday to the village of Exelby, North Yorkshire, to reports the bull had escaped. PCSOs kept the public at bay while a number of police marksmen, understood to have been at least two accompanied by a commander, tracked the animal as the incident unfolded. The bull was then shot dead at 1.30pm - just as Mr Marley said it had retreated to a field and workers were encouraging it into a shed 40 yards away. Mr Marley, a cattle and sheep breeder who also owns two butcher's shops, said Billy was worth £5,000 and has made a formal complaint to police. 'It wasn’t an aggressive bull,' he said. 'I fed him every day. 'My nine-year-old daughter used to feed the bull along with some of our other cattle on a Sunday, and I wouldn't let the girl do that if I had any doubts about his character. 'I imagine she'd be very upset if she knew what happened to Billy but I'm not going to tell her. It'll be easier to tell her I sold the bull than have her in tears.' Upsetting: The incident on Monday lasted two and a half hours and ended in the bull being shot dead . He added: 'They had no right to shoot him - he was doing no harm and he was not a danger to anyone. 'The bull got out and ended up in another field. The owners of that field put the bull out onto the road and called the police to say there was a dangerous animal on the road. 'The police marksmen then came and shot the bull, even though it was about half a mile from the road and causing no one any harm. 'By that stage there were people herding it into a shed and everything would have been alright given a bit of time. 'The animal was in no way aggressive. I've got plenty of his calves still here and their temperaments are all brilliant - very gentle animals. 'He knew the sheds and he wasn’t going anywhere. He weighed around a tonne so he wasn’t a fast runner. There was absolutely no need to kill him at that point. 'It’s a disgrace. They never gave us a chance.' A North Yorkshire Police spokesman said: 'The complaint will be dealt with by the Professional Standards Department. It would be inappropriate to comment further until this process has been completed.' Mr Marley said it was unlikely his insurers would pay out because Billy had been shot by police. But he added: 'I’m not so bothered about that, it’s not the insurance, it’s the animal itself. 'He was a fine healthy bull. He was one of two. I’d had him about two-and-a-half years and would probably have kept him for another ten years.' North Yorkshire Police declined to comment on the specific complaint. A spokesman said: 'It will be dealt with by the Professional Standards Department. It would be inappropriate to comment further until this process has been completed.' Speaking generally, Inspector Mark Henderson added: 'It's the last resort for the police and firearms officers to take this action. We try everything else but if the public are in danger, that's our priority.'","Billy the Blonde d'Aquitane strayed into road near Bedale, North Yorkshire .

The video, taken by a passer-by, shows the officer apparently attacking the man as he was arrested in Derby city centre in July. Senior officers have now launched an inquiry into the incident after studying the alarming footage. Scroll down for video . The video, taken by a passer-by in July, shows the officer apparently throwing a punch at the suspect as he was arrested and restrained in Holcombe Street, Derby. Police said an internal investigation had been launched . The footage shows the suspect being restrained by police and appears to show the officer arguing with him . The video shows the suspect being pulled along Holcombe Street by officers, as he shouts abuse at a third officer who follows them down the road. Then, as they approach a police car, the third officer appears to argue with the suspect before apparently launching himself at the man landing a punch on his face. Filmed by an onlooker who did not want to be identified, a woman's scream can be heard before the video cuts out. In response, a force spokesman confirmed the incident took place in late July and that an internal investigation had been launched. At the time of the incident, the suspect had been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and public order offences. Alan Charles, the police and crime commissioner for Derbyshire, who oversees the work of the county's force, said: 'Police officers deal with very difficult situations on a daily basis. 'The public have the right to expect officers to behave in a professional manner. 'If any officers don't meet these standards, then they can certainly expect any breaches to be thoroughly investigated and appropriate action taken.' A woman's scream can be heard on the video footage after the officer apparently punches the suspect's face . The suspect can be heard arguing and shouting at the police officers as he is restrained in Holcombe Street . Mark Pickard, Derbyshire Police Federation chairman, said: 'We are confident that, if a complaint is made, then the Derbyshire force will carry out a thorough investigation. 'The force has an exemplary record when it comes to investigating complaints from members of the public about its officers and staff. 'Police officers are bound by the force's standards and the new Code of Ethics and, as such, their behaviour must meet stringent guidelines. 'Where their conduct is found to be wanting, there are also procedures in place to ensure they are dealt with appropriately.'

She said: 'I am shocked to hear that a police officer can behave in this way. 'The whole idea of the campaign is that, whatever the provocation has been, people should not lash out with their fists. 'The campaign was launched in the hope that people learn that their fists are weapons and should not be used. 'It asks that when faced with a potentially explosive or tension-filled atmosphere, they take 60 seconds to think about exactly what the consequences of their actions might be.'","Video appears to show policeman throwing a punch at suspect in Derby .

Amy Jarmain, 24, and husband Charlie, 21, from Staffordshire, were cheered on by guests as they got drenched to raise money for charity moments after tying the knot. They surprised their guests by announcing they were going to do the popular challenge after their ceremony on Saturday. Scroll down for video . Taking the plunge: Amy and Charlie Jarmain are doused in icy cold water during their reception . Before the deluge: The happy couple hope that others will now follow their example . The couple were then doused in ice-cold water as they sat on two wooden chairs outside the Wheatsheaf Inn in Onneley, Staffordshire. Mrs Jarmain, who has two children from a previous relationship, wore her £450 dress and veil for the challenge while her groom was wearing his wedding suit complete with tie and waistcoat. Now the blushing bride has revealed that their efforts have raised £180 for the Motor Neurone Disease Association. 'We were nominated to do the challenge by my sister-in-law Joanne the day before we got married,' she added. 'We kept it a surprise from the guests so they only found out when my brother Stephen announced it during his speech. 'Some people told me I was mad to do it in my wedding dress but I was only going to wear it once so I didn’t mind. As guests counted down, Mrs Jarmain, still in her veil, was soaked with icy water by sister-in-law, Joanne White, 35, leaving her to spend the rest of the wedding with wringing wet hair. Although she did bring a change of clothes, she says she was left uncomfortably cold. 'Everyone said they couldn’t believe I went through with it but I said I was going to do it so I did,' she added. The couple now hope their example will by followed by other brides and grooms. 'I want to thank everyone who donated money on the day,' said Mr Jarmain, a supermarket worker, 'and I would definitely recommend the challenge to all couples who are getting married. 'Amy didn’t actually tell me about she was planning for us to do it on our wedding day so I only found out during the speeches.

"By . Mark Duell for MailOnline . A group of travellers moved onto a seafront park yesterday - and promptly received parking tickets on their luxury caravans as they soaked up the sun. The group - who arrived in about 10 vehicles - parked up on Hove Lawns in East Sussex immediately sparking complaints from passers-by of rubbish left near the Kingsway coastal road - almost directly opposite the local council’s offices. Council officials visited the travellers with police and traffic wardens to issue penalty charge notices to some of their vehicles, and also served them with a notice to leave the area. 'Holiday': The group arrived on Hove Lawns in East Sussex and there were soon reports from passers-by of rubbish left near the Kingsway coastal road - almost directly opposite the local council's offices .

Rubbish: Council officials visited the travellers with police and traffic wardens to issue penalty charge notices to some of their vehicles, and also served them with a notice to leave the area . Council litter pickers also visited to tidy up. One of the travellers told the Brighton Argus that they were holidaymakers from London who had stopped because one of their vehicles had broken down. They said they had been planning on going to Clacton-on-Sea in Essex - which is more than 120 miles away. If they do not leave by Friday then a court hearing will take place, the council said. Local police confirmed that some of the travellers had purchased parking tickets, but others had not and were given penalty charge notices by parking enforcement officers. A Brighton and Hove City spokesman told MailOnline today: ‘The council has carried out a joint visit with the police and parking enforcement officers to a group of ten lived-in vehicles parked on the highway opposite Brunswick Terrace in Hove, adjacent to Hove Lawns. ‘We have issued penalty charge notices to illegally-parked vehicles and are continuing to work closely with the police to monitor the situation.

"By . Tamara Cohen For Daily Mail . David Cameron has joined the open revolt against John Bercow over his bid to hand a top parliamentary job to an ‘unqualified’ Australian. The Prime Minister ridiculed the Speaker at a meeting with Tory MPs, asking whether he should now stuff the letter recommending Carol Mills for the job ‘down the back of the sofa’. According to tradition, the Prime Minister receives a letter naming the candidate chosen for the £200,000-a-year job as Clerk of the House, and passes it on to The Queen. Commons Speaker John Bercow has written to David Cameron recommending Carol Mills for the top job in Parliament, but has since put the plan on hold after a backlash from MPs . Since sending the letter recommending Miss Mills last month, Mr Bercow has been forced into a humiliating retreat, after dozens of MPs signed a motion questioning her suitability for the role. A senior official at the Australian Senate, they say she may have the administrative skills to run the Palace of Westminster but has no knowledge of procedure – on which the Clerk must advise MPs. Miss Mills has been dubbed the ‘Canberra caterer’ because her duties there involved running the Senate kitchens. The Speaker told Parliament on Monday that he acknowledged the barrage of concerns from MPs on all sides and announced a ‘pause’ in the recruitment process. MPs piled in later that afternoon, with eleven of them raising ‘points of order’ to question him over the issue as the Prime Minister looked on. Last night, according to insiders at a private meeting of Tory MPs, Mr Cameron stoked the row by joking to colleagues: ‘I considered raising a couple of points of order myself’. The Prime Minister added: ‘What am I supposed to do with the letter he’s given me? Give it to the Queen or stuff it down the back of the sofa?’. Former transport minister Simon Burns lead the charge in Parliament today asking Mr Bercow: ‘Will you be withdrawing [the letter] until after the pause has been completed…or will it just float around in No 10 until some relevant point?’ 'Canberra caterer': Carol Mills' appointment has been criticised by MPs from all parties and this week Mr Bercow announced he was 'pausing' the recruitment process . Carol Mills is the current Department of Parliamentary Services secretary in Canberra, Australia, a service department that supports the work of the Federal Parliament and is the principal support agency for Parliament House. It works closely with the Department of the Senate and Department of the House of Representatives to support the operations of the Parliament and its Committees, has around 800 staff and an annual budget of around $120 million. She is the former director general of Communities NSW and the Department of Arts, Sport and Recreation. Miss Mills, the head of the Department of Parliamentary Services in Canberra, was selected by a panel of senior MPs led by Mr Bercow in July. Recruitment consultants had been brought in for the first time to conduct a global search for candidates. In a face-saving move, Mr Bercow has agreed to hold a consultation on whether the post should be split. But MPs now consider it unlikely she will take up the role either way. In his first interview since the scandal started brewing last month, Mr Bercow claimed it was ‘damning’ that none of the 84 most senior Commons officials was from an ethnic minority. The Speaker has recommended the 650-year-old job of Clerk be split in two, with Miss Mills fulfilling the role of chief executive overseeing management, and another official to advise MPs on procedure. But in response to criticism that the recruitment process for both jobs should then be re-run, he said he would not be ‘dying in a ditch’ to keep her if MPs did not want a chief executive. Mr Bercow claimed the Commons clerks, steeped in parliamentary tradition, lack the experience to oversee Parliament’s £200million budget, 1,750 staff, and a major programme of restoration. He told the Financial Times there was ‘something a tad incongruous about expecting one person to be both the procedural expert and the top-flight manager/chief executive’. Mr Bercow was under further pressure tonight after it emerged tonight that Tory MP Michael Fabricant has written to the Speaker claiming he had 'misled' Parliament over his plan to appoint Miss Mills. Mr Fabricant raised a point of order in the Commons earlier today, claiming that the recruitment firm advising on the appointment of the Clerk was stopped from giving evidence about the suitability of Mills for the job. Mr Bercow said the Tory MP was 'unfortunately, but fairly predictably' wrong. But Mr Fabricant has insisted that the recruitment consultants Saxton Bampfylde were prevented from telling the panel advising on the appointment that Miss Mills was under two investigations by the Australian Senate. In his letter to the Speaker, Mr Fabricant wrote: ‘Saxton Bampfylde did wish to provide further information about Ms Mills, including the fact that she is under two investigations by the Australian Senate, but this offer was rejected. You may now wish to put the record straight.’ The Clerk of the House is the impartial main political adviser to the House, and adviser on all its procedure and business. They often appear before Select and Joint Committees to examine Parliamentary and constitutional matters. They sit at the Table of the House, and wear court dress, with a barrister's wig and silk robes. The Clerks of the table are consulted by the Chair, Ministers, Whips, and MPs on any matter that may arise in the conduct of a sitting. They also act as the Chief Executive of the House of Commons Service, which is made up of 2,000 people, and chairs the Management Board. The current Clerk is Sir Robert Rogers, who has held the position since October 1, 2011, and was knighted the following year. On April 30, he announced he intended to retire at the end of August, after four decades in the House.","Prime Minister jokes about what to do with Bercow's nomination for job .

"By . Katy Winter for MailOnline . Many adults now avoid many foods, believing themselves to be intolerant or allergic . Eating with a group of friends can nowadays be fraught with the difficulties, as more and more people claim to be prey to  food allergies, intolerances and diet specifications. This isn't surprising, given that more than one in five adults is avoiding certain foods because of an allergy or intolerance - even if many of them only think they have it, according to new research. But genuine or not, it means up to a third of households have had to adapt mealtimes to cope with a member of the family who cannot or does not eat certain foods. And that has led to a 'phenomenal' growth for the industry providing foods free from gluten, lactose, nuts or a host of other ingredients affecting millions of Britons. A survey for trade body, the Food and Drink Innovation Nework, found 22 per cent of adults said they had either an allergy or intolerance to certain foods or drink. The poll of 1,600 adults did not ask for proof, so it is entirely possible that many may have wrongly linked health or digestion problems to particular types of food that they now avoid. Dairy and gluten are the most popular types of food to be given up by those who believe they have an allergy or intolerance, said the industry body. The survey was commissioned ahead of a summit on the 'Free From' industry next week in London. It found twice as many women as men say they have an allergy or intolerance. The growing number who think they have a food allergy has led to a 'phenomenal' growth for the industry providing foods free from gluten, lactose, nuts or a host of other ingredients affecting millions of Britons .

New EU regulations mean any restaurant, pub or other catering service must, from December, list all potential allergens in the ingredients for all meals and products. The research added these will have a 'dramatic effect on the catering and food service industry.'","New study found 22 per cent  said they had either an allergy or intolerance .

They described the review as 'not a true view of Looe'. The AA has now apologised and promised to re-word the review in its next edition. One holidaymaker from York says the reviewer needed 'a trip to a well known opticians' and another slammed it was a 'very narrow perspective'. Gill Bridges, whose Polraen County House is advertised through the AA, said: 'Why should I pay a company to advertise when they then rubbish the town I trade in ? I feel like pulling my membership.' Town crier Roger Bennett offered to take the reviewer on a walk around the town to 'let them see and hear the quality of life in Looe'. The AA Guide to Cornwall, pictured, also said Looe in east Cornwall was a place where 'you won't find the traditional Cornish thatched cottages or peaceful walks' Town crier Roger Bennett offered to take the reviewer on a walk around the town, pictured, to 'let them see and hear the quality of life in Looe' The AA has vowed to work with the author of the review to reword the introduction with the revised version included in the next reprint of the guide . In a statement the AA said: 'Looe is a very popular place with plenty to offer visitors of all ages and we apologise for any offence that may have been caused by the wording used in the introduction. 'The section on Looe does highlight the array of great places to visit, however, with hindsight we agree that the opening could have been worded more sensitively. 'We will work with the author to reword the introduction and this will be included in the next reprint of the guide.' The review blames railway links for turning Looe into a holiday destination and the French for stopping the 'leisured classes' holidaying on the Continent. Walk some of the Smugglers' Way: A stunning trail from Boscastle on the north coast of Cornwall to Looe. The 36-mile route takes in Bodmin Moor and passes landmarks like the Jamaica Inn, Dobwalls and Sowden's Bridge. Visit the Wild Futures Monkey Sanctuary: Situated near the town, the active rescue centre features 37 animals. It is currently home to three different species - Barbary macaques, capuchins and woolly monkeys. A day out at East Looe Beach: Described by visitcornwall.com as a 'lovely bucket and spade-style beach' it is a long-time favourite with holidaymakers and a prime swimming spot right next to the bustling town. Crabbing on the harbour walls: Children can often be seen dangling lines off the harbour walls near East Looe Beach while others prefer to watch the world go by on nearby Banjo Pier. Take a boat trip: Many excursions leave from the town to explore the beautiful coastline and Looe Island, a wildlife sanctuary just off Hannafore Point and there is even a glass bottom boat so tourists can observe marine life.","Looe in east Cornwall described as 'brash' in new AA Guide to Cornwall .

"By . Dan Bloom for MailOnline . A sex attacker who groped a young woman in the street at 4am has been jailed after she filmed him on her iPhone. Luis Silva, 22, had fought with his girlfriend and 'drunk enough to sink a ship' when he exposed himself to the stranger, groped her and slapped her to the ground. When she revealed she was filming him, Silva tried to take her phone by force - but she ran away and handed the footage to police, who issued the images to the public. Intimidating: Luis Silva, 22, was 'drunk enough to sink a ship' when he exposed himself to a stranger at 4am, groped her and slapped her to the ground - but he was caught after she filmed him on her phone (pictured) Silva was jailed yesterday for three-and-a-half years  after he admitted sexual assault, attempted robbery and indecent exposure. Judge Robert Juckes QC said: 'The victim showed an extraordinary presence of mind and intelligence by recording the attack.' The court heard Silva, of Repton, Derbyshire, had spent £150 on whisky after a row with his girlfriend. He then went outside and wandered the streets of Evesham, Worcestershire, where he worked, until he found the victim. Prosecutor Paul Whitfield told Worcester Crown Court: 'The defendant began to follow the woman through the town. 'He approached her at a junction and exposed himself. Scene: The woman was walking in this street in Evesham, Worcestershire, where Silva worked in a chip shop . 'He then demanded she touched him and, when she got out her mobile phone to film him, he sexually assaulted her by touching her over her clothes.' West Mercia Police used stills from the footage to appeal for witnesses and Silva was quickly recognised. Sarah Holland, defending, told the court Silva did not remember the incident but was 'very ashamed' of his actions. He had moved to Britain from his native Portugal in January this year looking for a better life, she added. He had moved to be close to his girlfriend and had a job in a fish and chip shop in Evesham. Miss Holland said on the night of the attack Silva had an argument with his girlfriend and her mother, who was visiting from Portugal, and had gone out to 'drown his sorrows'.","Luis Silva pounced at 4am as woman walked in Evesham, Worcestershire .

"By . Laura Clark for the Daily Mail . A generation of teachers will struggle to introduce a tough new school curriculum because of their own poor grasp of the three Rs, a leading headmistress warned today. Many bright teachers are ‘completely at sea’ with proper English grammar and have little knowledge of the literary canon because their own education lacked rigour, according to Alice Phillips. Teachers had been ‘hastily’ swotting up ahead of the introduction of the new curriculum across primary and secondary schools this week. Problem: Teachers do not have a good enough grasp of English grammar, warns a leading headmistress . But Mrs Phillips, president of the Girls’ Schools Association, warned that extra training courses were not enough and called for more rigorous degrees for would-be teachers. Under the new curriculum, more emphasis will be placed on giving pupils a grounding in English grammar and punctuation. Pupils will also be required to study a broader range of classic literary works including at least one 19th century novel and a selection of poetry since 1789. In maths, pupils will be required to cover more material with greater emphasis on times tables, fractions, algebra and mental arithmetic. But Mrs Phillips, head of fee-paying St Catherine’s School, Bramley, near Guildford, Surrey warned that a generation of teachers would struggle to deliver the lessons because their own education lacked ‘breadth’. She said her school had introduced a specific English grammar course for 11-year-olds only to discover that some staff were ill-equipped to teach it. ‘In the process of introducing the course we quickly established that some of our younger teachers have not been taught English grammar in the 90s and 00s when they were at school themselves and, consequently, they feel less confident as they teach as relatively new learners themselves,’ she said in a blog for the TES teachers’ journal. ‘Many of our brightest, most enthusiastic teachers have little or no grounding in English language or grammar – through no fault of their own - and are completely at sea with many aspects of proper usage,’ she added. They would struggle to ‘delve into the mysteries of subordinate clauses’ with a class of 14-year-olds, she said. She also warned that some English literature teachers were ‘frankly, unversed in much pre-20th century literature’. Without prior knowledge of a broad range of texts, teachers may simply ‘bone up on two or three texts and stick to them’. But Mrs Phillips added: ‘This is not at all in the spirit of the new curriculum, nor will it be permissible. ‘Whilst, with the old GCSE, a teacher could stick determinedly to one or two staples, the new curriculum will change set text lists more regularly. ‘This is a welcome return to variety, but are we supporting our teachers to be ready and is there time to get this right for the first generation of students?’ In maths, there was already a shortage of qualified teachers. This would lead to problems teaching the new so-called ‘big fat maths’ curriculum, said Mrs Phillips. ‘While we undoubtedly have teachers who know the maths, there are not enough of them around to teach the extras. ‘This can only mean that schools will be placing in front of students teachers for whom maths is not their degree subject, or even an allied subject.’ In a series of proposals, Mrs Phillips called for student debt to be waived for graduates who stayed in teaching for 10 years. She also called for a Government PR campaign targeting pupils as young as 17 to encourage them to become teachers as well as a new breed of ‘subject-focused’ degree courses combined with educational theory to encourage more bright students into the profession. ‘Bridging the knowledge gap for a generation of teachers whose own education may not have included the breadth that the new curriculum espouses is our immediate task. 'Beyond that, we must ensure that future teacher training addresses subject knowledge as well as education theory,’ she said.","Leading headmistress Alice Phillips warned extra training is not enough .

"By . Tom McTague, Deputy Political Editor for MailOnline . and Jason Groves - Deputy Political Editor, Daily Mail . International Development Secretary Justine Greening has called for more working class Cabinet ministers . David Cameron would benefit from having more ministers who have stacked shelves in supermarkets, a Cabinet member said last night. The International Development Secretary Justine Greening suggested social mobility championed by Margaret Thatcher had been ‘diluted’ in recent years – and may have gone into reverse. Miss Greening, the daughter of a Rotherham steelworker, is one of the few working-class voices in the Cabinet. She told The Spectator magazine that working-class Tories ‘know how it feels to be slightly locked out of the system’. Miss Greening, who was an accountant before joining the Commons in 2005, revealed that her first job was at a branch of Morrisons. Asked if she would like to see more former supermarket workers in government, she said: ‘Yes, I would. I think it’s really important.’ She suggested her humble origins gave her a better understanding of the struggle faced by millions of people. Miss Greening said: ‘The harshest economic lesson I had was the day my dad became unemployed … I know what it is like to grow up knowing you are not starting in the best place, or that other people are having a better start than you are … it’s about understanding what it’s like to start from scratch more.’ Miss Greening did not comment on the upbringing of Mr Cameron and other leading Cabinet members, such as Chancellor George Osborne and Nick Clegg. But her comments will add to criticism that the Prime Minister relies too heavily on privileged advisers and ministers. It will also fuel concerns that the Tory leadership has failed to do enough to champion social mobility. Miss Greening said: ‘Margaret Thatcher’s message to me was, it doesn’t matter where you come from, this is a country where the effort you put in will mean you can get the reward out of it … Over the years that message has been diluted. ‘My biggest concern is that we are ending up with a country where … people are on different ladders. You might start at the bottom of a short ladder that will only get you so high. ‘What we need to recreate is one ladder that everyone can climb up.’ Miss Greening warned there was a danger the doors would ‘close back’ on young people’s aspirations unless ministers put social mobility at the top of the agenda. Mr Cameron has repeatedly insisted that improving social mobility is a priority. But he admitted last year there was a need to go ‘further and faster’. Last year Sir John Major described the dominance of a small private school elite as ‘truly shocking’. Mr Cameron insisted the Government had made ‘some progress’ on social mobility, but conceded that it was ‘still a problem’. Alan Milburn, the Government’s social mobility tsar, said last week that companies should be told to declare the social background of their workforce to combat a ‘deeply elitist’ culture at the top of public life. Privately-educated David Cameron and George Osborne were dismissed as 'two posh boys who don't know the price of milk' by Tory MP Nadine Dorries .","International Development Secretary said her first job was in a supermarket .

"By . Steph Cockroft for MailOnline . Two mechanics have spent two years and more than £50,000 transforming a classic car into a Ghostbusters replica. Classic car fanatic Paul Harborne, 52, from Dudley, West Midlands, was desperate to find a rare 1960 Cadillac Miller-Meteor which he could use for the project. When he did, the father-of-five and his business partner Tim Jordan dedicated two whole years to creating the ultimate Ecto-1 car replica. Paul Harborne, 52, and his business partner Tim Jordan spent two years converting this rare classic car into a Ghostbusters replica . They covered the car in white emulsion, painted on the famous Ghostbusters logo and even fitted mock ghost-capturing equipment onto the vehicle. The result - which cost £50,000 to achieve - is this traffic-stopping machine, which  is now being displayed at the Dudley Classic Car Show, in the West Midlands. Mr Harborne, who is also a huge film lover, said: 'I wanted to combine my love of films and classic cars and I've always wanted to own a cool classic car from a film. 'But the Batmobile had already been done so I went back to the drawing board. I have a soft spot for Ghostbusters and also the car was big enough to be used as a limo, which was a plus.' Mr Harborne bought this 1960 Cadillac Miller-Meteor two years ago, with the aim of turning it into an Ecto-1 . The sought-after car, which seats six people, was originally used as an ambulance in the U.S. Only 2,000 were produced during a four-year period . The sought-after Cadillac Miller-Meteor, which seats six people, was originally used as an ambulance in the U.S. Only 2,000 were produced during a four-year period in the late 1950s and early 1960s, meaning they are hard to come by. But after trawling car dealerships and the internet, Mr Harborne finally managed to find one, just a few miles away in Leicester. The pair painstakingly worked on the car every day, fixing and tinkering with it until they felt it was perfect . They covered the car in white emulsion, painted on the famous Ghostbusters logo and even fitted mock ghost-capturing equipment onto the vehicle . Mr Harborne, pictured, said: 'It really was a mammoth task to convert the Cadillac into something which would be show-stopping and recognisable as the Ghostbusters car- it wasn't a challenge for the faint-hearted' He said: 'It really was a mammoth task to convert the Cadillac into something which would be show-stopping and recognisable as the Ghostbusters car- it wasn't a challenge for the faint-hearted.' The pair painstakingly worked on the car every day, fixing and tinkering with it until they felt it was perfect. The biggest struggle Mr Harborne and Mr Jordan faced was finding the specialist parts for the car. Something in the neighbourhood: The original vehicle, used in the cult Ghostbuster film . He said it was 'exhausting' to work on the car every day but it was worth it for the reaction they get whenever they drive it . As the models were hand-built, factory parts are not easy to track down. The pair ended up building most of the bodywork themselves. Paul said: 'We worked on the car every day, which was exhausting, but it was such an exciting project. 'But it is so worth it, and the reaction we get when we take it out is incredible.' The car can now be hired out for parties, proms and weddings through Ghostsbusters Car For Hire.","Paul Harborne, from Dudley, wanted to combine love for film and classic cars .

"By . Louise Cheer for Daily Mail Australia . Men are more likely to make women hot under the collar by switching on a blender than turning on a power tool, according to new research. A team of neuroscientists were flown in from London to conduct scientific testing on 20 Australian couples to determine what domestic duties aroused women the most. While their male partners were performing activities from traditional do-it-yourself tasks and drilling to cake mixing, coffee-making and blending, their female counterparts had their mental, emotional and physiological responses monitored. Scroll down for video . New research has found women are more aroused by their man cooking in the kitchen than using power tools . The research - which is the first of its kind in Australia - was commissioned by home appliances brand Sunbeam. It was found that female partners were more aroused when their significant others were making a cup of coffee or whipping up a cake (57.5 per cent) than using a power drill or a saw (55 per cent). Additionally, women were happier when their man was cooking than helping around the house, including ironing and building flat-pack furniture. The research also showed that seven out of 10 women likened receiving a home-made coffee from their partner to receiving a gift or a loving embrace. The research commissioned by Sunbeam had neuroscientists do scientific testing on 20 Australian couples . While their male partners were performing activities, their female counterparts had their mental, emotional and physiological responses monitored . Sexologist and relationship expert Dr Nikki Goldstein said she was not surprised by the findings. 'As a woman, I agree with the research,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'But it will surprise some men because I think a lot of men think women are turned on by men doing masculine activities.' Dr Goldstein said seeing men in the kitchen showed off their creativity, especially with the rise of more male celebrity chefs like Curtis Stone.

'They’re thinking outside the box and I think that is very appealing to a women,' she said. 'Men can say ""I care about you, I love you"" but when they make something tangible like a coffee, it shows them they care.' Dr Goldstein also advised couples to spend more time together in the kitchen to strengthen their bond. 'I think it’s good for couples to get in the kitchen together because they can share what happened during their day and experience something together,' she said.","The new research was carried out on 20 real-life Australian couples .

The Brussels Griffon and Terrier cross was moments from death after being discovered by an animal control officer who scheduled for her to be euthanised after no owners came forward. However, at the last minute she was saved by A Home 4 Ever rescue center, in Bellflower, California, and staff nursed her back to health and even raised money to buy her a sparkly pink wheelchair. Scroll down for video . Daisy, a Brussels Griffon and Terrier cross, was born without the use of her front legs, and was abandoned at just two months old before being found by an animal control officer . The adorable pup was nearly euthanised after no owners came forward to collect her, but she was saved at the last minute by A Home 4 Ever rescue center . Now Daisy has a new owner, Sheena Main, and likes to spend her time going on long walks. Sheena said: 'I am so proud and happy to see Daisy being mobile. Without the cart, she hops like a bunny and that consumes a lot of energy for her, so the wheels mean we can go on longer walks. 'Daisy can do everything that a normal dog can, except to climb up and down the stairs or jump on something high. 'She is able to live a happy life with us and is quite active, despite her disability.' Vets have no idea what caused Daisy's disability, though it is believed she was born with the condition, which may have led to her being abandoned. Staff at the centre nursed Daisy back to health and bought a pink sparkly wheelchair to help her get around . Seven months after being found Daisy was adopted by Sheena Main and now enjoys going for long walks . Within a few months of arriving at A Home 4 Ever, Daisy got her new wheels but didn't feel comfortable with them at first and would only use them if a treat was dangled in front of her. Sheena said: 'We have later learned that it was due to the cart not fitting properly. 'After adjusting the wheel cart, she adapted to it very quickly and we all enjoy taking long walks, which was not possible before.' After the readjustments to her cart Daisy and Sheena get to meet new furry friends, although some of them are wary of her 'different' appearance. 'The cart has even helped boost her confidence when meeting new dogs,' said Sheena. 'Having said that each dog reacts differently to Daisy - some just accept her and greet her like any other dog. Without her wheelchair, Daisy hops on her hind legs in order to get around which uses up a lot of energy meaning she cannot walk far. But with her new wheels she can take leisurely walks along with other dogs . Sheena says Daisy was reluctant to use her cart at first because it didn't fit properly, but after having it readjusted she quickly go used to it and now takes to it with ease . 'Some are frightened by her wheels and run away and a few bark every time she makes any movement. 'But Daisy doesn't really seem to mind how dogs react to her and she wheels along in her own happy little world.' It's not just canine chums who notice Daisy when she's strutting her stuff out and about . Sheena said: 'Daisy does get quite a bit of attention from people, and she loves it. 'I am often asked about her and if they can photograph her during our walks. Sheena says that while most dogs don't seem to mind Daisy's wheels, some are frightened and run away . 'It's great when people take an interest in Daisy because that allows us to raise positive awareness for the special needs. 'It saddens me when people see Daisy and tell us how sad it is that she has to live with a disability.

"By . Melissa Hills For Daily Mail Australia . Julie Hayes, principal Cowandilla Primary School in Adelaide . Proposals for more Mandarin to be taught in schools across Australia has been hailed as 'brilliant news'. The South Australian government is considering an English-Mandarin bi-lingual program that could start in early 2016 to help strengthen cultural and economic links with China. A working group is looking at the benefits of establishing a bilingual school, the programme would start from primary school age to Year 12 students. Julie Hayes, principal Cowandilla Primary School in Adelaide told Daily Mail Australia, she thought it was a 'fine idea' if the school did not already teach a language. 'It would help us understand the Chinese people more because language carries culture and encapsulates how people view the world. 'It would help us understand the Chinese perspective, values, family and religion. 'It is important and whatever language you end up studying it gives you an insight into the world of those people. 'We have 67 per cent of our children who are non English speaking at this school, it is a real mix of everything. 'We already teach three languages at this school, it's historically an area of Greek and Italian descent so we teach those and also aboriginal language Pitjantjara. 'We would not take on any new languages because we do enough already and because they have historic connections to us they are far more important.' Children learning Mandarin in a bilingual school will make it easier for them to take in the language, say experts . The South Australian bilingual schools working group will be tasked with researching possible funding models for bilingual programs, identifying a school willing to transform its curriculum to that of a bilingual school and working with the school to develop an appropriate curriculum. Angela Scarino, associate professor of Applied Linguistics at the University of South Australia told Daily Mail Australia there was 'bucket loads of evidence' to show that being bilingual improves kids learning across the curriculum. She said: 'This is brilliant news for South Australia. It's fantastic in relation to language learning because it is the most robust way to of ensuring the children learn the language. SA Premier Jay Weatherill wants more children to learn Mandarin at school . 'Chinese is wonderful language given the place of China in the world. 'Because Chinese is a more distant language for Australian learners it is important that children have a good amount of time on task to learn the language. 'With the bilingual approach the students have more exposure to the language.' South Australia Premier Jay Weatherill says increased proficiency in Mandarin will help South Australia enhance its engagement with China. 'Language is an important carrier of culture and this proposal will help strengthen our already strong relationship with China. 'In the early years of primary school, I envisage that lessons might be conducted in Mandarin on three or four days per week, before the balance is adjusted as the students grow in confidence in both languages. 'I understand that English-speaking students need to engage in around 2,800 hours of intense, focused study to become proficient in Mandarin - this is only possible in an immersion environment. 'Our relationship with China must be more than transactional. ''My government is keen to strengthen the cultural aspects of our relationship with its economic partners, so these relationships can grow in the long term.' Education Minister Jennifer Rankine is currently in China to promote Chinese schools adopting the SACE, so more international students may chose Adelaide as a preferred study destination. Chad Sexton-Finck, principal of Redcliffe Primary School in WA  called the new initiative 'terrific' Mandy Scott, secretary for the Association of Learning Mandarin in Australia told Daily Mail Australia: 'I think this is the way to go because the more time you can spend on the language the better.

"By . Darren Boyle for MailOnline . Volanda Cousar, pictured, allowed her three-year-old grandchild to steer her silver Chyrsler in the car park of an Orlando apartment complex when it crashed . A 47-year old grandmother has been charged with child abuse after she allowed her grandson to steer her car in a car park while sitting on her lap. The three-year-old crashed into three cars at an apartment complex in Orlando, Florida on Sunday when police were alerted. An eyewitness saw the car hit three vehicles and ran to confront the driver, only to discover a three-year-old boy behind the wheel. Documents posted by The Smoking Gun confirm that Volanda Cousar, who has a New Jersey driving licence was arrested on Sunday afternoon following the incident and taken to Orange County Jail where she signed a $2,000 bail bond. Orlando Police Department arrested Cousar at the scene. According to arrest documents seen by Mail online Officers D Bates and T Campbell were told to go to Cypress Woods Drive 'with reference to a suspicious incident'. The arrest affidavit said: 'While en-route to the scene, OPD dispatch advised a silver four-door vehicle seen crashing into parked cars in the parking lot of the above listed address. 'Witnesses told dispatch that a small child was seen sitting on the lap of the driver while the crashes were occurring. 'Upon arrival we observed a sliver Cyrsler four-door vehicle parked in the center of the parking lot. The driver of the vehicle later identified by New Jersey driver licence as Volanda Cousar, was standing next to the vehicle with a three year old black male juvenile. 'While on scene we met with a witness Thomas Hannon, who advised in a sworn written that he was in his apartment when he heard loud crash coming from the parking lot. Cousar is accused of letting her grandchild steer her car in the car park of this Florida apartment complex . 'Hannon exited his residence and observed a silver four-door vehicle, driven by V Cousar, crash head-on into a parked vehicle and then back into another parked vehicle. 'He advised that while crashing into the parked vehicles in the complext parking lot he could clearly see a young child sitting on the lap of V Cousar in the front seat. 'Hannon advised the child had both hands on the wheeland was clearly steering the vehicle. Hannon ran to the vehicle to confront V Cousar and to prevent her from leaving the scene before officers arrived. 'Based on the above facts and statemnts probable cause exists to charge Volanda Cousar with child abuse as her actions could reasonably be expected to result in physical or mental injury to a child.'

"By . Anna Edwards . The former Youth Police and Crime Commissioner Paris Brown has been interviewed under caution . Paris Brown,the foul-mouthed youth crime commissioner who was forced to quit after her string of offensive Tweets, has been interviewed under caution about her comments. The 17-year-old's mobile phone was seized and she was questioned by officers from Kent police's Special Branch. Her lawyers described Kent Police’s response as 'wholly disproportionate' and claimed it was 'inconceivable' that her comments would be sufficient grounds for prosecution. Olswang Solicitors accused Kent Police overreacting and accused them of having no proper basis for interviewing the teenager under caution, or making her surrender her phone, The Times reported. Police started investigating 17-year-old former Youth Police and Crime Commissioner Paris Brown after discovering she used a racial slur in her Twitter profile. Miss Brown resigned after it was revealed that she used her personal Twitter account to make a series of offensive, racist and homophobic posts. Kent Police are understood to be looking at tweets where Miss Brown uses the word 'n*****' – an offensive term for black people – in alternative spellings. The force also confirmed it has received more than 50 complaints but is yet to decide whether Miss Brown has committed any offence. Scroll down for video . Ann Barnes, Kent Police and Crime Commissioner, left, with Paris Brown, before the teenager's offensive rants were investigated . Her account, where she posted or . circulated more than 4,000 messages, was deleted last Saturday after . this newspaper asked her to explain messages referring to drug use, . underage drinking and threats of violence. Miss Brown wrote the messages during the last six months before she was given the role of helping the force 'stay in touch with young people'. She called homosexuals 'fags', immigrants 'illegals' and travellers 'pikeys', and said she had 'a thing for older men', an apparent reference to a teacher at her former school. In another tweet, seemingly referring to cannabis, she wrote: 'I really wanna make a batch of hash brownies.' And she attacked the men in the reality TV programme Made In Chelsea, writing: 'Everyone on Made In Chelsea looks like a ******* fag.' Paris Brown's lawyers have written to Kent Police Chief Constable Ian Learmonth about the scope and nature of the investigation . Today it emerged that Paris's lawyers, Olswang, have written to Kent Police Chief Constable Ian Learmonth about the scope and nature of the investigation, including the decision to seize her phone and for Special Branch to quiz her. In the letter, her lawyers said: 'That appears to be wholly disproportionate and unjustified having regard to the Twitter material itself and the broader circumstances of the case.' They said Paris, from Sheerness, Kent, was visited by a Special Branch officer at her home on April 11, along with a second officer, and asked to surrender her mobile for examination. Then she was requested to attend an interview under caution on April 14. She was quizzed for one hour and seven minutes about material posted on her Twitter account which had already been published in the media. Her phone was returned three days later. In their letter, her lawyers said: 'As we are sure that you will readily understand, being subject to a police investigation is highly distressing for any person, but especially so for a teenager, particularly one who has been recently subject to such adverse media coverage. 'In such circumstances, we believe that the police must weigh carefully the extent to which an investigation relating solely to social media activity is merited.' Olswang also referred to the interim guidelines from the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), Keir Starmer, regarding prosecutions relating to social media. Paris's lawyers said it was 'immediately apparent' from reviewing the Twitter material that it would be 'inconceivable' that they would form sufficient grounds for a prosecution. 'There is nothing in the Twitter material which could be deemed, even on its face, to be grossly offensive or otherwise unlawful,' the letter added. 'There was therefore no proper basis on which to require our 17-year-old client to surrender her mobile telephone, to caution her or to subject her to a detailed police interview whilst under caution.' But Kent Police have defended their actions, saying they are reacting to complaints from members of the public and are seeking to establish whether any offences have been committed. 'Kent Police received more than 50 complaints from members of the public and are currently investigating to establish whether any criminal offences have been committed in relation to this incident. 'Kent Police disagrees with the interpretation of the investigation given. 'Officers must first determine the extent of the misuse of social media so that the Crown Prosecution Service can then, taking into account the DPP's interim guidance, determine whether or not any potential evidence meets the set criteria for a prosecution. 'We will investigate all complaints thoroughly but cannot comment further on the progress of a live investigation.'

'Crossrail for the bike': The east-west cycle superhighway will run for 18 miles from Barking in the east to Acton in the west . Some 19,000 cyclists are killed or injured in reported road accidents in the UK every year, according to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents. Last autumn six cyclists were killed on London's roads in two weeks, leading to calls for more money to be invested in cycle lanes and safety measures. At the time, former Olympic cyclist Chris Boardman asked Mr Johnson to look at banning heavy good vehicles from the roads during peak hours. This is a system already implemented in Paris. Out of 14 cyclists killed last year in London, nine were involved in accidents with HGVs. At Ludgate Circus, one of the areas being redeveloped in the plans, seven cyclists are said to have died since 2008 - the latest being in April this year. The EAST-WEST Cycle Superhighway would start at Tower Hill, where it would connect to the existing Barclays Cycle Superhighway Route 3 (CS3), which runs east to Canary Wharf and Barking. From Tower Hill, the new route would run along Lower and Upper Thames Street, Victoria Embankment, across Parliament Square, to Hyde Park Corner and through Hyde Park, across Lancaster Gate and up Westbourne Terrace. From there, it will travel on the Westway Flyover from Westbourne Bridge to Wood Lane and would continue along the A40 Western Avenue as far as Kathleen Avenue, Acton. The East-West Cycle Superhighway would start at Tower Hill, where it would connect to the existing Barclays Cycle Superhighway Route 3 (CS3) The design of the section from the Westway to Acton is still being finalised and will be consulted on at a later date. Apart from a short stretch in the Lancaster Gate area and a low traffic street adjacent to Upper Thames Street tunnel, the new Superhighway would be entirely physically segregated. In central London, there will be connecting Quietway backstreet routes to other parts of the City, the West End, Paddington, Maida Vale, Notting Hill and many other places. There will also be connections to an upgraded Cycle Superhighway 2 for Mile End and Stratford. From Tower Hill, the new route would run along Lower and Upper Thames Street, Victoria Embankment and across Parliament Square . There will also be connections to the existing segregated track across Southwark Bridge, connecting to Cycle Superhighway 7 and Quietway routes in Southwark. Connections are proposed at the western end to Shepherds Bush, Acton, Ealing and Wembley town centres and to the Park Royal trading estate. Proposals for cycling infrastructure improvements on Westminster Bridge will also be covered as part of the Better Junctions scheme at Westminster Bridge Road. Our wish is for segregation for cyclists on the bridge, subject to this being feasible. From Westbourne Terrace, it will travel on the Westway Flyover from Westbourne Bridge to Wood Lane and would continue along the A40 Western Avenue . The NORTH-SOUTH Cycle Superhighway would start at Elephant & Castle, where it would connect to the existing Barclays Cycle Superhighway Route 7 (CS7) at Princess Street. From Elephant & Castle the North-South Cycle Superhighway would run along St. George’s Road, through St. George’s Circus, along Blackfriars Road and cross Blackfriars Bridge before connecting to the proposed East-West Cycle Superhighway on the north bank of the River Thames.

'I have been punished for them, I'm not complaint about that,' he said. 'But getting stitched up and charged with zero evidence for a crime I did not do is not something I will sit back and take.

"By . Freya Noble for Daily Mail Australia . Some may know Christiaan Van Vuuren better as Dom Nader from Bondi Hipsters, while others may have followed his journey from the Fully Sick Rapper before the apathetic characters went viral on YouTube. But there was an unlikely catalyst that kick-started Christiaan's career and now he, his brother Connor Van Vuuren and their friend Nick Boshier are pinned as some of Australia's most promising and innovative comedians and producers. In 2009 Christiaan, originally from Cronulla Beach south of Sydney, travelled to South America for a holiday away from his Sydney advertising job. What he didn't know was that he would bring back with him a rare and deadly disease. Scroll down for video . Christiaan Van Vuuren (right) and Nick Boshier (left) make up the dynamic duo known as Bondi Hipsters . In 2009 Christiaan spent over six months quarantined in a Sydney hospital after he contracted tuberculosis, seen here in a recreation for one of his projects . The then 27-year-old shot to online fame with his character the Fully Sick Rapper, whose songs were mainly about his illness . The then 27-year-old was diagnosed with tuberculosis after he was rushed to hospital coughing up blood. He spent 21 days in quarantine before he was released. But Christiaan received a phone call just weeks later, when one of his doctors broke the news that he actually contracted a drug-resistant form of the disease. Back in the Sydney hospital room where he would spent more than six months straight in quarantine, he had to find a way to amuse himself. In a bid to fill the long days spent mostly in isolation, Christiaan started making videos with the aid of his new laptop in a bid to entertain himself, and a handful of friends. From this, the Fully Sick Rapper was born. 'It was a bit of a fluke really - it wasn't like getting TB made me go ""I want to make videos"",' Christiaan told Daily Mail Australia. Christiaan Van Vuuren (left), Nick Boshier (right) and Connor Van Vuuren (not pictured) shot to fame after their Bondi Hipsters videos went viral . The trio have garnered international fame and recently appeared in an advertisement for Old Spice . Connor joined forces with his brother while he was in hospital and the pair began to produce videos together . The above video can be viewed in full here. Warning: it contains strong language. 'At first I was just kind of really bored and dealing with what it was like to be confined ... They had me on a lot of medication which affected my attention span', he said. Christiaan filmed himself making an array of hilarious and touching videos from the confines of his hospital room - most of which revolved around his sickness. His doctor, TB specialist Dr Hazel Goldberg told ABC's Australian Story it was inspiring to see someone deal with a potentially life-threatening illness in such a positive way. But Dr Goldberg also revealed just how serious the disease was: 'It was clear from the state of Christiaan when he presented at the hospital that this was a fairly advanced case'. What started as a pass-time for Christiaan developed into hundreds of thousands of views from a growing online audience, despite the comedian's initial refusal to engage with social media. What started as a pass-time for Christiaan developed into hundreds of thousands of views from a growing online audience . Nick Boshier (right) teamed up with the brothers shortly after and the trio have a TV show on the way . Christiaan's doctor Dr Hazel Goldberg revealed just how serious his drug-resistant TB was . By 2009 Facebook had really taken off worldwide but Christiaan didn't want anything to do with it. 'Why would you want to watch your friends online - why not catch up with them?' he said. The irony that it was social media - where he has millions of views on Youtube and close to 100,000 likes across various Facebook pages - that really kickstarted Christiaan's career is not lost on him. Fast forward through Christiaan's long recovery, which involved daily trips to the hospital for treatment for a full year after his release, the he Connor - known then as the Van Buuren Brothers - met Nick Boshier. Coming together over their shared Youtube prominence the group decided to collaborate, and the gluten-free clean-living fashion-conscious Bondi Hipsters, originally just the Hipsters, were created. Following the exploits of Dom Nader, played by Christiaan, and Nick as Adrian 'Aids' Archer, Bondi Hipsters 'started off as a little left-jab at those Bondi guys'. Arguably their best-know Bondi Hipsters video The Organic Life has raked in over a million views on YouTube . Nick Boshier, who portrays Adrian Archer in the comedy pieces, joined forced the with Van Vuuren brothers after meeting them at a YouTube conference . The group release regular videos and have a new one on the way at the end of this week . The idea for Bondi Hipsters spawned from the contradictions they observed in people living in the area . 'Whenever you go out there's lots of young kids out interested in environmentalist issue but they weren't changing their own lives... (They) care about all the big things as long as they don't affect their own lives', Christiaan elaborated. Their most popular video is titled The Organic Life, and highlights the contradictions they observed in people living a 'clean' life in Bondi while hitting up the party scene on the weekends. Christiaan's time in hospital also reignited the strong friendship between he and Connor. 'I would say my brother is my best friend', Christiaan said. On Four Corners Connor just how strong the bond which emerged from his sibling's illness was and said: 'I thought if I get it too (TB) that's okay at least I'll be in there. And it was a bit of a self destructive instinct'. 'I was fighting back tears watching that in the living room - I know he just wanted me to get better', Christiaan told Daily Mail Australia. 'It was a really emotional moment.' While Christiaan has become somewhat of a spokesperson for the group, he made sure it was known just how much work goes on behind the scenes and the hard yards Nick and Connor also put in. 'I can't stress enough how much they are responsible for', he said. 'And so much of this is owed to Connor, he's a brilliant writer', Christiaan added. The trio's latest venture is a TV show on ABC 2 called Soulmates, which tracks the friendship of two souls through the ages . Dom and Adrian are up for Cleo Bachelor of the year, but the characters insist they would never enter themselves as it's too mainstream . Their move to TV sees them jump from the computer screen to the small screen thanks to their immense popularity online . The hard work has paid off for the trio and the they have made the jump from computer screens to the small screen. Their new TV series title Soulmates will air on ABC 2 next month, and is loosely based on the character quirks and traits evident in the Bondi Hipsters. It tracks two souls as they live their lives through different reincarnations, and despite the out-there graphics and crazy concepts Christiaan said reincarnation 'feels like a more possible concept than it used to'. The show is based on 'the idea if you're in a reincarnating soul what happens from life to life? Is the idea of a soul mate... is there a reason for that? Is it because they were someone else to you in another lifetime?' The boys are also keeping very busy making as much content as they can across all platforms and the Bondi Hipsters are set to release a new video at the end of this week taking on the financial system and the big 'bahnks'. Characters Dom and Adrian have also been nominated for Cleo Bachelor of the year, and although they insist they didn't nominate themselves, Christiaan had other thoughts about that. 'My opinion as Christiaan is that Dom entered himself, but pretended he didn't.' 'Then Adrian entered because Dom did', he laughed.","Christiaan Van Vuuren contracted potentially deadly tuberculosis in 2009 .

"By . James Chapman for the Daily Mail . 'Unpredictable threats': Defence Secretary Michael Fallon urged increased defence spending to ward off countries like Russia . Britain is under pressure to extend a commitment to spend at least 2 per cent of national income on defence as it demands Nato allies boost their investment. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said every member should increase military spending to deal with ‘unpredictable and uncertain threats’, particularly from Russia. The Prime Minister said Britain was showing leadership by being one of only four of the 28 Nato states to meet the alliance’s spending target. But critics, including senior Tories, pointed out that the Government has only pledged to maintain that level until the current spending round ends in April 2016. Pressure is growing on David Cameron to enshrine the commitment in legislation for good. Britain and the United States will also use the Nato summit in Wales to push for a new rapid response force comprising of between 3,000 and 5,000 international troops, which could be deployed within two days if member states face military aggression. The organisation is proposing to beef up its presence in eastern Europe following Vladimir Putin’s annexation of Crimea and attempts to destabilise more of Ukraine. It is also proposing military exercises alongside Ukrainian forces as a warning to Moscow. France was last night shamed into cancelling plans to sell a multi-billion pound warship to Russia following protests from the US and the UK. Mr Fallon insisted Nato must ‘toughen up’ to deal with the new threats facing the West. He said the alliance must sharpen its activities to contend with crises, including ‘almost daily atrocities’ in the Middle East. The Defence Secretary said the West could either ‘enfeeble’ the transatlantic alliance by allowing defence spending to fall, or ‘revive its spirit’ by boosting investment. ‘Let me be very clear about the UK’s position,’ he said. ‘It’s time now to toughen up so that Nato can deal with the aggression and the threats that we face. Commitment: Mr Fallon spoke out ahead of a meeting of Nato powers in Newport, Wales (pictured) ‘That means rapid reaction forces that are worthy of the name, that means better sharing of capability, and it means the first ever public commitment to increase defence spending. ‘That will demonstrate to all those who threaten us that the state of our transatlantic bond is strong. ‘Nato was formed on the basis that Europe would pay her way. ‘Like any insurance policy, defence only pays out when you pay in.’ Colonel Bob Stewart, a Conservative MP who was the commander of Nato forces in Bosnia, said Mr Cameron should put the two per cent spending commitment into law - rather than a separate pledge to legislate for 0.7 per cent of national income going on foreign aid. Increased presence: Nato is planning to beef up its forces in war-torn Ukraine . Labour MP Thomas Docherty added: ‘It’s typical of the Tories that they are lecturing our European partners about defence when they won’t commit to adequately funding our troops beyond the next financial year. ‘Michael Fallon should be getting his own house in order before trying to tell voters what to do.’ The Government will seek to demonstrate its commitment to defence spending by unveiling a £3.5billion deal for nearly 600 new armoured vehicles, the Army’s largest single order for armoured vehicles for more than 30 years. Mr Cameron said the UK had the second largest defence budget in Nato and was providing ‘leadership’ on spending within the alliance. Other countries, including Canada, have fiercely resisted calls to increase defence spending above two per cent of GDP.","Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said Nato members should increase funds .

"By . Lillian Radulova for Daily Mail Australia . Stung by the Australian foreign minister's attempt to ban them from the G20 summit this year, Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs took to Twitter to have a go at Julie Bishop herself. But the joke was on them at the end of the Twitter tirade, when Australia's ambassador in Russia ridiculed the ministry right back for confusing Ms Bishops gender, while adding in his own quip about their controversial presence in Ukraine. 'The Australian FM's idea not to invite Russia to the G20 summit is not surprising but he should not lose sight of its principles,' Russia's MFA tweeted, quoting their own foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov. Australia's Foreign Minister, Julie Bishop, was the subject of a twitter tirade after she was referred to as a'he' Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs posted the offending tweet when it took to Twitter to warn Ms Bishop against trying to ban Mr Putin from the G20 world summit in Brisbane . Sweden's foreign minister Carl Bildt was first to notice the gender confusion and quickly tweeted in response: 'You should know that Australia FM Julie Bishop is not a 'he'. Fairly basic.' Paul Myler, Australia's ambassador located in Moscow, thanked Carl with his own loaded Twitter comment. 'Thanks Carl! Borders, genders – all a bit confusing right now!' Mr Myler said. Mr Myler is not the only national ambassador on Twitter taking aim at Russia over their growing presence in Ukraine. Sweden's foreign minister  was first to notice the gender confusion and responded with this tweet . Australia's ambassador  in Moscow thanked Carl while adding in his own quip regarding Russia'a presence in Ukraine .

"By . Jamie Redknapp . The World Cup has started with a bang and we've seen some sensational games but, make no mistake, every football fan in the country will already be looking forward to next season. Last year’s Premier League was one of the most dramatic we’ve ever seen and, with a new cast of characters, let’s hope for more of the same. Louis van Gaal arrives at Manchester United fresh from Holland’s incredible destruction of world champions Spain — and the fixtures have thrown up the perfect start for the Dutchman. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Van Gaal: I am proud to be coach of Manchester United . Perfect start? Louis van Gaal will not face a top six side until October when he takes over at Manchester United after the World Cup . First up: Wilfried Bony (centre) and his Swansea team-mates will be Van Gaal's first challenge . Fit and firing: Van Gaal will be hoping Robin van Persie continues his World Cup form at Old Trafford . Blue is the colour: Van Gaal is aiming to regain the Premier League title from Manchester City . In contrast to David Moyes, who had a very tricky start to last season, Van Gaal has a set of relatively straight-forward games to begin with. He opens with the same opposition as Moyes — Swansea — but Van Gaal won’t have to play a top-six team until Chelsea come to Old Trafford in October. They are still a few good players away from being strong enough to get back to the very top, but with that run of games United could well be the early pacesetters. For the promoted sides it’s a time of huge excitement. When are your great away days at Anfield, Stamford Bridge, Old Trafford? Leicester’s Nigel Pearson, Sean Dyche at Burnley and that up-and-coming young manager at QPR, will be looking forward to each and every game. Experienced: Van Gaal does not face a top six side until taking on Jose Mourinho's Chelsea in October . Up we go: Harry Redknapp (left) led QPR to victory in the Championship play-off final, while Sean Dyche (right) secured automatic promotion with Burnley . Top tier: Nigel Pearson led Leicester City back to the Premier League for the first time in a decade . Leicester host Everton on day one and QPR will entertain Hull, but Burnley will be absolutely delighted that they have Chelsea at home first up. It will be the Ginger Mourinho  versus Jose Mourinho, and what a game for Dyche to get his side off and running and to get Turf Moor bouncing. Diego Costa could prove to be a new hero for Chelsea while Cesc Fabregas will join him in west London, but Arsenal fans will be in no mood for forgiveness when the sides meet. Liverpool will try to balance another title charge with European football, but Manchester City will not let the trophy go without a fight. The Premier League is the best in the world. It’s where every player, manager and fan wants to be. Now we know  who faces who and when. Roll on next season. New boy: Cesc Fabregas will come up against his old club Arsenal with Chelsea next season . Second time lucky? Steven Gerrard (right), Luis Suarez (left) and their Liverpool team-mates will be hoping to mount another title challenge after late disappointment last season .","Van Gaal will take over at Old Trafford after the World Cup with Holland .

"By . Daniel Piotrowski for Daily Mail Australia . The federal government refused to let the son of a hero World War II pilot who fought and died for Australia become a citizen because his father died too early. Former English teacher Dr Mark Cremin, 74, from East Sussex in the U.K., was amazed when his application for Australian citizenship was denied earlier this year. His father, Flight Lieutenant Daniel Cremin, was born and raised in Sydney and took to the skies and died for his country as part of the RAF during World War II. The lieutenant was commended for his courage and his name is listed among countless other Australians at the War Memorial in Canberra. But that sacrifice was not enough for his son, Dr Cremin, to be recognised as an Australian citizen. Dr Mark Cremin, left, aged 74, was denied Australian citizenship even though his father, right, was an Australian war hero who fought for the Royal Air Force. Lt Cremin flew Spitfire and Hurricane aircraft as a flight instructor and part of 66 Squadron. Above, a squadron of Spitfire aircraft is pictured in 1944. Lieutenant Dan Cremin, pictured with fellow RAF members at a Royal Air Force base in Iraq. Lt Cremin's son, Mark, believes he was serving as a flight instructor at the time. A dashing Lieutenant Daniel Cremin was awarded a Distinguished Flying Cross. The Cross is granted 'for exceptional valour, courage or devotion to duty whilst flying in active operations against the enemy'. 'My father was, and his family in Australia are, as Australian as anyone else in the country,' Dr Cremin, from East Sussex, said in an impassioned plea to a tribunal last month. 'My father even gave his life for the freedom of Australia,' he said. Dr Cremin has extended family in Australia - his uncle even played for the Wallabies, the national rugby team. But he cannot become a citizen because of a legal technicality. Australians were considered 'British subjects' until citizenship laws went into force in 1949. But Dr Cremin's dad died seven years before he would have automatically become a citizen. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal upheld the ruling against Dr Cremin two weeks ago. Now he is unsure where to turn. Dr Cremin said the law was 'perverse', 'unjust' and did a disservice to some Australian heroes. 'My father was singled out for his bravery in action, and he shouldered the responsibility of commanding a front line squadron... and his war record marks him down as an Australian and he like all those on the war memorial in Canberra have been listed as Australian,' he said. 'Now this Australian-ness is denied, treating them as if they were mercenaries because they have been excluded from being called Australian, by the ruling.'

Lieutenant Cremin flew a number of planes, including a Spitfire (left) and a Hurricane (right) as a flight instructor for the RAF. A cartoon of Lieutenant Cremin drawn by one of his squadmates. Lieutenant Cremin with his wife and her sister in an image taken in Egypt before the war. Dr Cremin told Daily Mail Australia he wanted to become an Australian to be closer to the memory of his father who he never knew. 'The major reason is a sentimental one: of in some small way getting closer to my father,' he said. Dr Cremin's adult son, Daniel - who is named after his grandfather - told Daily Mail Australia he hoped the Australian government would reconsider how they interpreted the law. He said: 'I am very proud of my grandfather's courageous and selfless decision to leave his birthplace in Australia and travel thousands of miles to fight in the Middle East and Britain and eventually give his life for our freedom.' 'I'm sure there will be many Australians of my father's age who will be shocked to read of this unjust and discriminatory interpretation of a law that surely was not intended to preclude Australian war heroes and their children from claiming citizenship. A spokeswoman for Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said: 'Australian citizenship laws are necessarily very strict. 'These laws do not provide the Minister with discretionary power to grant citizenship in these cases.' Dr Cremin is considering an appeal to the Federal Court.","Dr Mark Cremin's dad, Daniel, was an Australian war pilot .

"By . Jennifer Newton . A five-year-old boy whose chronic diabetes meant he had never spoken said his first words just days after starting a 'miracle' treatment. Jack Neighbour suffered from health complications related to neonatal diabetes and it meant he could only communicate with his family through picture cards. But just six weeks after a genetic test by a team at the University of Exeter he switched from insulin injections to tablets. Jack, far right, aged 14, who was unable to speak until he was five due to neonatal diabetes. He is pictured with father Paul, brother Tom and mother Emma . And then he delighted his family with his first words aged five, the simple phrase, 'hello mummy'. Family life was then transformed from a 'living nightmare' to a home filled with laughter after the diagnosis at the University of Exeter Medical School, based at the Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust. Now aged 14, Jack's diabetes is far easier to manage and he no longer has to prick his finger up to 15 times a day to check his blood sugar levels. His mother Emma Matthews, told her son's story while taking part in an event, organised by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), which brought together 34 families from across the world who have benefited from the same treatment. Jack, pictured here aged 17 days old, suffered from volatile blood sugar levels and mother Emma says he was often very 'whingey and whiney' Ms Matthews said: 'It was just hideous. I'm a nurse, and I had to work nights and my husband had to work days, so Jack always had someone with him who knew how to manage his diabetes. We had no family life. 'We'd wake up in the night with Jack completely manic because his blood sugar level was so high, or in convulsions on the floor because it was so low. 'We couldn't take part in normal activities because we had to take so much medication and bags of sugar, to account for any eventuality. 'It was a living nightmare and we were all absolutely shattered.' Jack now aged 14, with his mother Emma, who says he now 'never shuts up!' The turning point came when a relative spotted a newspaper report about a boy whose life had been transformed by his diagnosis by the Exeter researchers, and by switching treatment. Ms Matthews, from Essex, contacted the Exeter team, and soon had the diagnosis that changed everything. 'At that point, Jack was still in nappies. He was often very whingey and whiney, and he never spoke. The . condition is caused by a change in a gene which affects insulin.This . means that levels of blood glucose (sugar) in the body rise dangerously . high. The main feature of the condition is being diagnosed with diabetes under the age of six months . Around 20 per cent of people with neonatal diabetes also have some . developmental delay or . epilepsy. The treatment . breakthrough came when scientists discovered that genetic mutations . which lead to neonatal diabetes sometimes caused abnormalities in a . channel within the pancreas. The . abnormal channels are corrected by taking sulphonylurea tablets to . allow the patient's pancreatic cells to release their own insulin. To date, more than 300 people have been successfully treated across the world. 'He made sounds and we communicated through a system of picture cards. 'Within just a few weeks of switching treatment, it became obvious that Jack's blood sugar levels were really stable. 'He had stopped collapsing on the floor and he suddenly started smiling and laughing. 'He turned into a really happy little chap. Six weeks later he came out of school and all the staff were grinning from ear to ear. 'He came up to me with this big smile on his face and said 'hello mummy' - the first words he had ever spoken. 'Now he never shuts up! Jack will always have severe special needs but now his diabetes just isn't an issue. For us, it really was a miracle.' Neonatal diabetes is diagnosed within the first six months of life, and can be associated with complications such as severe learning difficulties or epilepsy. Professors Andrew Hattersley and Sian Ellard, of the University of Exeter Medical School, have funding from the Wellcome Trust to continue this work into neonatal diabetes until at least 2020. Professor Ellard said: 'We're delighted to welcome these families from all over the world to Exeter. 'It's always extremely gratifying and humbling to see first hand that research by the team at the University of Exeter Medical School is yielding real benefits to families. 'In many cases, their diagnosis and the switch from insulin injections to tablets has significantly improved blood sugar levels and allows them to eat a normal diet. 'Some have seen better muscle strength, concentration and sleep patterns. 'This family day is a chance for us to learn from them about how clinical care can be improved, as well as to follow their progression. Jack has benefited from the breakthrough treatment at the University of Exeter . 'It's also a valuable chance for families to get together and support each other.' Dr Alasdair Rankin, Diabetes UK Director of Research, added: 'It's really important to know if your child has neonatal diabetes so that they can start getting the tailored treatment they need. 'We're proud to have funded research that has led to a better understanding of the genetic causes of this rare condition, providing answers for parents and improving the lives of children affected.'","Jack Neighbour suffered health complications related to neonatal diabetes .

"By . Louise Boyle for MailOnline . The third American missionary worker to have contracted Ebola was named today as Dr Rick Sacra as his colleague Nancy Writebol spoke for the first time following her amazing recovery from the deadly virus. The 59-year-old aid worker, along with her husband David, smiled broadly and waved for the cameras as she spoke at length at the SIM USA charity's campus in Charlotte, North Carolina on Wednesday. Mrs Writebol beamed as she said it was wonderful to be with everyone just weeks after falling ill with the virus which kills 90 per cent of sufferers. She thanked God for her survival and said: 'Some mornings, I woke up and thought ''I'm alive'', and some mornings I woke up and thought ''I'm not going to make it anymore.''' Scroll down for video . Dr Rick Sacra, pictured with his wife Debbie. His charity announced today that the 51-year-old doctor contracted Ebola while working in the obstetrics ward of the missionary hospital in Monrovia, Liberia . American missionary Nancy Writebol, pictured today, said that she felt very grateful to be alive and thanked God along with the doctors and nurses who helped her recover from Ebola . Missionary charity SIM also used the press conference to name aid worker, 51-year-old Dr Rick Sacra, who had contracted Ebola. Dr Sacra is a veteran doctor who, along with his wife Debbie, has served SIM since the late 1980s and is a former director for the charity in Liberia. The doctor, whose family are currently based in Austin, Texas, was in Liberia to establish a program in family medicine. The SIM spokesman said that Dr Sacra had volunteered a month ago to return to Liberia. It is unclear how the 51-year-old doctor contracted the virus as he had not been caring for patients in the Ebola ward but delivering babies by C-section and natural birth in the obstetrics unit. Dr. Richard Sacra is seen in this undated family handout photo working in Liberia. Sacra is the third American doctor reported to have contracted the Ebola virus while working in West Africa . Dr Sacra is currently being cared for in the ELWA Ebola care center in Monrovia with discussions taking place to decide if he will be transported back to the U.S. Mrs Writebol contracted Ebola in July at the same hospital where Dr Sacra is currently being treated, around the same time as her missionary colleague Dr Kent Brantly. The 59-year-old grandmother said at the press conference today: 'I would like to say good morning to Liberia and our prayers are for you and with you in West Africa.' She continued: 'This is not our story, this is God's story.' Mrs Writebol thanked her husband, sons and daughters-in-law, along with the doctors and nurses in both Liberia and at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta who had cared for her. She called the Emory medical team 'amazing people' and added: 'They are a lot of fun to be around, if you have to be in the hospital.' She added that it had been an 'amazing privilege' to be part of a missionary hospital in Liberia where she helped to dress and decontaminate doctors and nurses to keep them safe. American missionary worker Nancy Writebol, with her husband David, spoke out for the first time today following her recovery from Ebola . David Writebol, pictured on Wednesday, with his wife Nancy said that he was deeply grateful to medical teams for saving her life . Nancy Writebol, pictured just a month ago, being stretchered into Emory University Hospital in her protective suit. She has made a tremendous recovery from Ebola after contracting the disease in West Africa . The 59-year-old said that she had been asked multiple times why she had gone with her husband to Liberia and simply answered: 'It was God's call. That was where we sensed God was leading... It was a joy to be there, there was not a fear there.' She described how she first began to feel unwell on July 22 and was tested for malaria which came back positive. After taking malaria medication and with her condition growing worse, Mrs Writebol was tested for Ebola. She described the moment that the news she had the deadly virus was broken to her by her husband David. Mrs Writebol said: 'David went to hug me and put his arms around me and I knew how dangerous that was and I said, ''David, don’t. Just don’t.''' 'I walked into the living room and our doctors were in the living room and all they could say is, ''We are so sorry, Nancy, we are so sorry.'' All I can remember saying to them is, ''It is going to be OK.''' 'I had no clue what was going to happen. Of course, I knew what the outcome could be. But there was no fear, a sense of the Lord's peace was with us... But there were some very, very dark days.' Since her recovery, Writebol said she has been asked whether she believes that it was the experimental drug, supportive care, the Liberian or U.S. medical staff or her faith that saved her life. The aid worker said: 'My answer to that question is all of the above. I want to say first, to God be the glory, because he is the one who gives us life and numbers our days. But God uses doctors, and God uses experimental drugs. We don’t know whether the drug helped or worked. We don’t know whether it was the supportive care, but I’m telling you it was very, very necessary. And we are seeing wonderful results just from supportive care in West Africa.' Mrs Writebol's co-worker Dr Kent Brantly, who also contracted Ebola in Liberia, spoke on Tuesday about his battle. He told NBC how the disease quickly took hold of him, leaving him struggling to breathe and his body overcome with violent shaking. Dr Brantly, 33, said: 'And I said to the nurse who was taking care of me, ""I'm sick. I have no reserve. And I don't know how long I can keep this up."" And I said, ""I don't know how you're going to breathe for me when I quit breathing.""' Ebola survivor Dr Kent Brantly speaks to NBC's Matt Lauer in an interview aired on Tuesday. He revealed how his battle with the disease left him struggling for breath and violently shaking . The Writebols left their home last year for missionary work at a clinic in Liberia, where Nancy Writebol's duties included disinfecting staff entering or leaving the Ebola treatment area. After she was infected, Mrs Writebol was flown to the United States and kept in isolation at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. She was released on August 19 and has been spending time with her husband at an undisclosed location. Her husband was quarantined for a week at the SIM campus before being released. Ebola has killed more than 1,500 people in West Africa - 10 per cent of those health care workers -  and is spread by direct contact with blood or bodily fluids. Dr Brantly was released last month after spending three weeks in an isolation unit at the same hospital as Mrs Writebol. Mrs Writebol and Dr Brantly both contracted Ebola through their vital healthcare work at Elwa hospital in Monrovia, Liberia.

"By . Sarah Michael for Daily Mail Australia . A couple who travel around Australia prospecting for gold and gemstones have captured the incredible moment an ant tried to steal one of their nuggets. Walter Krikowa and his wife Liz, from Canberra, were on a recent gold hunting trip in the Kimberly in Western Australia when they came across the little insect making a getaway with their precious find. Mr Krikowa, 60, dug a number of gold nuggets out of a sandy creek and had just returned to camp to show his wife what he had found. Scroll down for video . Walter Krikowa and his wife Liz captured the moment an ant tried to steal one of their gold nuggets . The Canberra couple witnessed the tiny heist while on a prospecting trip in the Kimberly in Western Australia . But when he accidentally dropped one of the nuggets he turned around to pick it up, only to discover a meat ant was trying to steal it. 'He was a cheeky little bugger, wasn't he?' Mr Krikowa told Daily Mail Australia. 'I was pretty surprised, you hear about situations where they do take things back to their nest like garnets and quartz crystals, but you never think they go for gold. 'Maybe I should check a few ants' nests!' When they realised what was happening, Mrs Krikowa quickly grabbed her video camera to capture the heist on film. In the video the ant can be seen dragging the gold nugget with its two front jaws. Mrs and Mr Krikowa run a construction company in Canberra but every winter they go prospecting for three to four months . During their recent trip the couple found over 300 nuggets, weighing approximately 9 ounces (255 grams) They returned to Canberra last week after three and a half months on the road chasing gold and gemstones throughout Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland . Mr Krikowa said the ant was 'persistent', and in the film it can be seen taking a number of breaks before giving up and crawling away. Mr Krikowa said the nugget weighed just under a gram and would have been several times the weight of the ant. He added that he thought the ant had brought them luck. 'The next day we got a really good day and ended up with two ounces [of gold],' he said.

"By . Richard Spillett for MailOnline . Political leaders are to study an award-winning plan  to create around 3.5million new homes by expanding up to 40 towns and cities. Planner David Rudlin was awarded the Wolfson Prize this week for his idea to double the size of existing towns and cities by building more than 80,000 homes in 'garden cities' in the green belt. Party leaders are now said to be taking an interest in his ideas after he won the respected competition - the second biggest economics prize in the world after the Nobel Prize. Scroll down for video . A map of David Rudlin's imaginary city, Uxcester, used in his plan to tackle the UK housing crisis. The new developments are shown in lighter colours to the north west, east and south west of the existing city . Mr Rudlin beat nearly 300 entrants to the prize and his ideas are now likely to be viewed by political leaders . Mr Rudlin proposed expanding a fictional city he called Uxcester, loosely modelled on Oxford, using the principles of the garden city movement of the 1890s. He says towns with existing populations of around 150,000 people could each be expanded to provide around 86,000 new homes for another 150,000 more people over the next 30 to 35 years. Mr Rudlin says the opposition of locals to large housing developments could be overcome by concentrating the majority of new buildings in one area and protecting others . Praising his plan, prize founder Lord Wolfson of Aspley Guise, who is known to be close to chancellor George Osborne, said: 'We urgently need to build more houses and great places in Britain. 'David's entry is a tour de force of economic and financial analysis, creative thinking and bold, daring ideas.' Labour and the Lib Dems are believed to be keen on the idea of new garden cities to meet the spiralling demand for homes in Britain. The plan is based around the idea of garden cities, like that built in Letchworth, Hertfordshire a century ago . The idea of garden cities, like Welwyn (pictured), is for homes scattered between parks and public gardens . George Osborne unveiled plans for a 15,000 garden city in Ebbsfleet, Kent earlier this year, but some Tories are wary of idea, fearing large house-building projects may lose them votes in rural towns and cities. A section of the report suggesting places for expansion lists Oxford, Cambridge, Reading, Guildford, Canterbury, Ashford in Kent, Rochester, Colchester, Chelmsford, Ipswich, Norwich, Northampton, Bedford, Peterborough, Rugby, Stratford-on-Avon, Worcester, Cheltenham, Stroud, Bath, Salisbury, Winchester, Poole, Taunton, Exeter, Shrewsbury, Stafford, Chester, Preston, Blackburn, Harrogate, York, Harrogate, Lincoln, Durham and Carlisle as possible contenders. Nearly 300 experts entered the £250,000 prize, with five finalists chosen before Mr Rudlin was announced as the winner. A plan by homelessness charity, Shelter, to build a new garden city on the Hoo Peninsula in Medway, Kent came second. The garden city movement arose in the late 19th century around the utopian ideas of Sir Ebenezer Howard.

"By . Julian Robinson for MailOnline . Parents disillusioned with the school system have sold their house and pulled their children out of classes - to take them on a year-long educational road trip of the UK in a caravan. Amy and Ella Meek, aged 11 and nine, will attend 'road school' supervised by their mother and father who are both teachers from Arnold, Nottingham. The girls will swap classrooms and formal tests for trips to castles, museums and libraries up and down the country. Scroll down for video . Tim, and Kerry Meek, pictured, have taken their children Amy (right), 11, and Ella (left), nine, out of school for a year-long educational road trip . The trip, which will take at least a year, will take in the likes of Stonehenge, the Scilly Isles and salmon rivers in Scotland . The trip, which will take at least a year, will take in Stonehenge, the Scilly Isles and salmon rivers in Scotland. Father Tim and mother Kerry quit their jobs and sold their house to fund the trip, which will cover up to 20,000 miles. Most schoolchildren are now back at school facing a controversial new National Curriculum which requires five-year-olds to learn fractions and pupils in early secondary school to study Shakespeare. But the Meek family are in Peterborough where lessons include a science project looking at the mechanics of a trebuchet - a type of catapult used in the Middle Ages. Mr Meek, who quit his role at Derrymount Special School, Arnold, Nottingham, said: 'Children are not sausages in a sausage factory to be pumped full of facts and content ready for regurgitation at the end of some arbitrary Key Stage, when they take high-stakes assessments. 'We've given ourselves a minimum of an academic year but we are realistic and we know the girls will return to school at some point. Mr and Mrs Meek, pictured with their daughters, quit their jobs and sold their house to fund the trip, which will cover up to 20,000 miles . For the girls' first day of 'road school' on Monday, they visited historic Warwick Castle in Warwickshire (pictured) 'It's one of those things that's scary and people say you are brave, or silly. One thing we do know is that it's going to be a year to remember.' The 45-year-old stressed that he and wife Kerry, 39, were not unhappy with staff at the school, or at Richard Bonington Primary and Nursery in Arnold, Nottingham, where the girls attended. 'Education is becoming overly dominated with tests, assessments and targets, at the expense of rich, engaging and enjoyable learning,' said Mr Meek, who has budgeted to spend £20,000 on the trip.

She said: 'In school we were having tests all the time. We'd read from a book and just repeat it. 'We are going to have more freedom now and we'll still learn the important things like English and maths.' The Meeks insist they don't blame teachers, schools or even local authorities for their disenchantment with conventional schooling. Instead they say Government policies do not cater for the day-to-day needs of children and that youngsters are taught simply to pass exams.

The Meeks, pictured, have shown their adventurous side in the past and last year set their daughters a challenge of completing 50 new outdoor activities in 12 months . The 11-year-old added: 'I always felt like I was working towards a test. I had my SATs last year and we were reminded about them almost every day. It's like we just read from the book and repeated it for the test.' The Meeks have shown their adventurous side in the past and last year set their daughters a challenge of completing 50 new outdoor activities in 12 months. For the girls' first day of 'road school' on Monday, they visited historic Warwick Castle. Mr Meek added: 'We used the visit to Warwick Castle as the stimulus and asked the girls what questions they wanted answering. It's more engaging because they're inside the fascinating castle walls.' The girls were then set assignments to follow-up the trip and asked to carry out some educational research. Mike Fortune-Wood, of Home Education UK, said pupils taught outside of school tended to fare better than state school students. On the road: The family have set off from Arnold in Nottinghamshire and have already taken in trips to Warwick Castle and Peterborough . They will also take in Stonehenge during the tour. The children are likely to return to school after the 'ed-venture' He said: 'Home schooling is easier in many ways because it's one-on-one. The children don't waste hours listening while the teacher explains something to 30-odd other kids in the class. They can go at their own pace.' One criticism of home schooling is that children don't get as much social interaction with their peers. Ella, nine, said she was already missing her friends - although she thinks they would love to be doing what she is. 'I'm trying not to think about leaving my friends,' said Ella. 'But I think most of them would like to be exploring castles instead of sitting at a desk at school.' 'It's easy to keep in touch,' added Amy. 'I will miss my friends but we have social media and things like Skype to keep in contact. It's not like we're never coming back to Nottingham - we will visit.' Nottinghamshire County Council's education standards service director, John Slater, said: 'We respect the parents’ wishes in this case to provide alternative education for their children. 'As both are high attaining children we have no concerns and we wish them every success.'","Amy and Ella Meek taken out of school for year-long educational tour of UK .

"By . Kieran Corcoran for MailOnline . An interactive history project has breathed new life into an old treasure-trove of maps by matching them up to modern-day street layouts. The initiative, orchestrated by the British Library, unearthed and uploaded a huge trove of maps, which were made available to the public. Anybody who matches up a number of landmarks on one of the old documents - such as a road, river or church - to points on today's world map can add to the project, which now boasts more than 8,000 entries. While some of the maps show the pace of change - streets filling out, roads advancing and railways being built. However, many of the cities featured have still keep their distinctive character on a map. Others . To view the full project click here. Old and new: The above map shows the City of London and the boroughs of Westminster and Southwark as they were in 1733. The street layouts are in many cases the same - though there is more open space and no evidence of railways . From the archive: The London map, taken from a 1733 survey by Robert Seymour, shows the still-familiar layout of central London's streets. The city was radically reshaped after the Great Fire of London in 1666 . Victoriana: Modern-day Coventry is overlain above with a map image from 1898 - where the location of prominent railway lines through the city can still be seen . Difference: The settlement is noticeably less developed in years gone by. The map extract is taken from a 1898 Cassell & Co. book called 'Our own country. Description, historical, pictorial’ Invaders: This maps shows the south coast of England overlain with a map showing the invasion route taken by the Romans around 55BC . Geological: The lie of the land is still substantially the same, as it would have been in 1862 when the map was published and also centuries earlier when Ceasar and his legions landed on British shores . Four score and lots more years ago: This map shows the modern layout of Gettysburg in the state of Pennsylvania, where one of the bloodiest battles of the American Civil war was fought, which has been overlain with a military map showing troop layouts on the day. Some roads can be seen on both, while the large Freeway, marked in orange, would not have featured . Famous fight: The map shows the ground where Abraham Lincoln led to Unionist troops against their Confederate foes in one of the civil war's decisive clashes . Going through changes: This map of central Sheffield, taken from an 1874 edition, is again significantly less built-up than today - and major roads are narrower and less prominent .

"By . Alex Lazcano for Daily Mail Australia . Schools across Australia have been slammed by outraged parents for becoming too cautious after it emerged that childhood games, loom bands and even bibles have been banned by some teachers. It comes after a Queensland school decided to ban students from doing handstands and cartwheels which prompted outraged parents to reveal online what other things have been axed from their kids' schools. Peregian Springs State School parents were advised in a recent school newsletter by deputy principal Sandy Cathcart that 'cheerleading-style' stunts were not allowed unless children were supervised. Another distressed South Australian mother took to Facebook to reveal her child's school now insists all parents have a police clearance if they want to step into a classroom. The decision to ban cartwheels was made after students were injured while doing 'cheerleading-style' stunts . The mother filed her police clearance but realised it would take up to six weeks to be approved. 'For that time I am effectively not allowed in the classroom even for a few minutes,' she wrote. The woman's sister posted the status onto Reddit where many Australian parents insisted that it should not be the case unless the parent is working at the school. Meanwhile New South Wales primary schools are banning children from bringing loom bands to school to stop unfair swaps and sales. The newest playground fad made from rubber bands has been banned at Sydney's North Balgowlah Public School. Parents were warned via the school newsletter not to allow their children to bring the rubber bands to school. While in Victoria the Education Department has banned religious organisations from running prayer groups and handing out Bibles in state schools during school hours. Schools have banned children from wearing, trading and selling Loom bands . Under the new guidelines, parents give their written permission for their child to attend religion classes via a new government-approved form. A Melbourne primary school even temporarily banned the game 'tips' or 'tag' last year because a lack of fair play among the students. 'We can’t always win and no we don’t all get a prize and better to learn it now than when you are stepping out into that big wide world and you are told ‘no’ for the first time at 28,' a Facebook user told Kidspot. Leather balls were banned from Albert Park Primary School near Melbourne in a bid to prevent any head injuries incurred during sports games. While Black Rock Primary banned ballgames all together before and after school. Chief Executive of the AFL Andrew Demetriou told 3AW: 'It's bloody stupid.

"By . Deni Kirkova for MailOnline . A mother-of-one has dropped four dress sizes, going from a size 16 to a size 8, by swapping Hula Hoops for hula hooping. Kim Middleton 29, from Middlesbrough, North Yorks, got to her heaviest of 12st 9lbs after giving birth to her daughter as she turned to takeaways and bags of crisps to fit around her busy schedule. The teaching assistant was devastated when Elisha, now eight, wanted to learn to ride a bike but Kim found she was too big to be able to run after her. Scroll down for video . The busy single mother was always rushing around and would just grab unhealthy food on the go . But after picking up Elisha's toy hula hoop, she noticed the pounds soon melting away - and managed to hula herself slim. Kim said: 'I was sick of being too unfit to play with my daughter in the park and she got to the age where she was learning to ride a bike and I just couldn't help her the way a mother should. 'As a busy single mother I was always rushing around and would just grab unhealthy food on the go such as sausage rolls and packets of Hula Hoops. 'I'd be running around after Elisha all day and busy with work, so when she'd gone to bed I'd just order a takeaway and scoff on crisps. 'And I never did any exercise at all - I just didn't have the confidence.'

The turning point came when Kim stepped on the scales and was shocked that she had almost reached 13 st and was wearing a dress size 16. She said: 'I needed to make a change in my life - I was sick of being overweight and unhappy, eating unhealthy food so I swapped the fatty Hula Hoops for a healthier alternative - and I've never looked back.' Kim kick-started her weight loss by joining Slimming World, but she knew it would take more than just healthy eating to help her lose weight and have the toned stomach she had always dreamed of. She was inspired after seeing her daughter playing with her child's hula hoop and decided to give it a try for herself. Kim said: 'I was always desperate to have a flat stomach with a small waist and toned abs. When I started doing hooping I never thought I would get it, but I persevered and it paid off.' She would use her hula hoop while watching her favourite TV show Coronation Street, four times a week. Kim said: 'At the start it was hard going, and I ended up with a few bruises but once I got the hang of it I could really see my body changing.' In the past Kim would eat sausage rolls and packets of Hula Hoops until she joined Slimming World . After just a month's hula hooping, Kim was amazed that the pounds were falling off her . After just a month's hula hooping, Kim was amazed that the pounds were falling off her and after 18 months of hard work she had shed a staggering three and a half stone, and was a toned size 8. Kim, who went from 12 stone 9lbs to an impressive 9st 4lbs said: 'I am so happy with my body now, and the hula hooping has given the toned tummy I have always wanted. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to start getting fit - it's so simple and can fit into everyday life.' Kim is now a Slimming World consultant and offerS hula-hooping advice to the slimmers in her group. She said: 'It hasn't been easy but I have been motivated by my daughter. 'We hula hoop together now, and after all my family and friends have seen the change in me, they have all rushed out to get hula hoops too! 'It is such a fantastic way to exercise and toned up at the same time, and you can do it while watching the TV - so it really is the best of both worlds.'

"A 13-month-old baby girl in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen is suffering from a rare, undiagnosed disease which is preventing her from growing. The parents have turned to the media now to find medical experts who could provide help and a formal diagnosis. The infant, named Yuanyuan, weighs about 2.9 kg and measures in at 10cm. A 13-month-old Chinese baby has an undiagnosed disease that has stopped her from growing . Since birth, Yuanyuan has only gained 0.5kg in weight, which is less than a quarter of what a healthy baby should have gained in that time frame. She has grown only 10cm, less than half of what she should have, and bears a resemblance to Benjamin Button - a character created by U.S. author F. Scott Fitzgerald. [related] .

The parents have spent about 100,000 Chinese yuan - or more than AU$17,000 - on treatments, which has exhausted their savings, and they still do not know the cause of the disease or what is the appropriate treatment. The baby can only consume small amounts of breast milk and a formula known as sips, where a baby formula is injected through a hose attached to her nose. It takes her about two hours to eat 30 millilitres of milk. The baby is malnourished and her immunity is growing weak. Her parents say she can express joy through eye contact, but is unable to make any noises. She also has symptoms of eczema, requiring ointment to be applied after bathing. A doctor in Shanghai, Xiao Yuan, responded to the parents call for help on Weibo - a microblogging service - saying that Yuanyuan may have a digestive system disease.

"By . Sarah Michael for Daily Mail Australia . When Tina Ramsdell heard the story of British parents Brett and Naghmeh King being arrested in Spain, all she felt was empathy. The Kings sparked an international manhunt when they took their five-year-old son Ashya, who has brain cancer, out of a UK hospital and fled to Spain without the consent of doctors. Their decision drew global criticism but for Ms Ramsdell, 42, it just reminded her of her own story. In 2005 Ms Ramsdell, from Gympie on Queenland's Sunshine Coast, sparked a five-day manhunt across Queensland and New South Wales when she went on the run with her six-year-old daughter Brandy who had terminal leukaemia. Scroll down for video . Tina Ramsdell became a wanted fugitive after running away with her terminally ill daughter, Brandy, nine years ago . Brandy was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia two weeks before her sixth birthday in 2004 and underwent six months of chemotherapy while living in hospital . Brandy was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia two weeks before her sixth birthday in 2004 and underwent six months of chemotherapy while living in hospital. The cancer went into remission but less than two months later Brandy started showing signs that she was sick again. Ms Ramsdell has come to the defence of Brett and Naghmeh King who were arrested after they took their five-year-old son Ashya (pictured), who has brain cancer, out of a UK hospital and fled to Spain without the consent of doctors . 'Her hair started growing back but then she just got sick again you could tell - they get tremors and they can't warm up,' Ms Ramsdell told Daily Mail Australia. Ms Ramsdell went to see a GP who said he thought Brandy's leukaemia had come back. He told her he was calling the hospital and that she had to go there straight away. But Ms Ramsdell knew that because of the type of cancer Brandy had, and because it had come back a second time so quickly, she only had about a 2 percent chance of surviving. Ms Ramsdell didn't want Brandy's last months spent in a hospital ward hooked up to machines. 'The treatment's horrible, having to live there was horrible,' Ms Ramsdell said. 'I didn't want to go back to the hospital with that [survival rate] - the chemo didn't work and I didn't want to make her go through it again.' She spoke to the Brisbane hospital on the phone and told doctors they were on their way. 'I just sort of lied and said ""I'm packing now, it takes us two hours to get there"",' she said. 'We did a runner like this other family.' Ms Ramsdell said Brandy only had about a two percent chance of surviving and she didn't want her last months spent in a hospital ward hooked up to machines . At first she took Brandy to a friend's house nearby but she soon realised that whoever she stayed with would be dragged into the situation so they only stayed one night. Ms Ramsdell then went to her uncle's house in Brisbane and stayed a night, after which he drove her to her cousin's house south of the NSW border. She stayed there a night before going back to her uncle's house in Brisbane. After a couple of days Ms Ramsdell turned on the TV and saw her and Brandy's faces on the news and that's when she realised the scale of the police manhunt. 'I just had a gut feeling they were going to be there by 9am the next morning and they were,' she said. Brandy died at home on August 29 2005, a month after she was discharged from hospital for the second time . 'The house was surrounded by police cars, helicopters and media were blocking off the street. 'It was full on.' Ms Ramsdell wasn't arrested but she and Brandy were taken straight to hospital and she was kept guarded by police. 'I wasn't handcuffed and I was allowed to stay with Brandy,' she said. Child welfare officers were also involved and Brandy was made a ward of the state for 48 hours. 'I was so angry. l let them know they could have one overnight stay and one blood test and then we were leaving,' Ms Ramsdell. 'That was when I realised I was allowed to [refuse chemo], and that I shouldn't have gone on that big police chase.' Brett and Naghmeh King were arrested in Spain but have since been released . When Brandy was allowed to leave hospital Ms Ramsdell took her home, and she spent the next few weeks on a bed in the lounge room where she was 'comfortable and warm'. Brandy died on August 29 2005, a month after she was discharged. Forensic police came to the house to interrogate Ms Ramsdell and they confirmed there was no foul play. 'You just answer their questions as best you can. The two detectives were really good, really respectful,' she said. While she wishes she had never run away with Brandy, the experience has turned Ms Ramsdell off hospitals. She also has a four-year-old daughter Pearl Possum who suffers from Edwards syndrome – a disease related to Down syndrome.

"By . Steph Cockroft for MailOnline . Jeremy Smith, 45, from London, raped a woman in a swingers' club in Sheffield during a Halloween party . A cabaret performer has been jailed for five years after raping a woman in a swingers' club while dressed as Herman Munster. Jeremy Smith, 45, was part of a male cabaret team performing at a Halloween party at La Chambre in Attercliffe, Sheffield, when he attacked the woman in a room of mirrors. The married father, who admitted taking Viagra, was dressed as the character from The Munsters while his two friends were dressed as Harry Potter and Herman's wife in drag. Jailing Smith at Sheffield Crown Court today, Judge Peter Kelson QC said the defendant had behaved 'shockingly'. He said: 'Having taken drink yourself, you behaved shockingly. 'This is a crime which leaves the victim nothing else then devastated, and she was surely devastated.' The 22-year-old victim, who was at the club with two friends, said she only went to the club to socialise and never indulged in sexual activities. But the court heard that, after meeting her that night, Smith - formerly of Tingley, Wakefield who now lives in London - plied the woman with alcohol. He then raped the woman in an indoor smoking room which was 'covered in mirrors', the court was told. It meant his victim was forced to watch every moment of the terrifying ordeal. Kama Melly, mitigating, told the court it was 'the toxic combination of being in a place where sexuality, and sex itself, was paraded in front of him' that led Smith to commit the offence. Prosecutor Charlotte Baines previously told the court that La Chambre was a private members' club, commonly known as a swingers' club. She said: 'It opens its doors to members with a view to them watching or participating in sexual activity, if they wish to do so. 'Upstairs in this club there are rooms commonly known as 'play rooms' for individuals who want to engage in sexual activity. The defendant was there with two friends performing a cabaret act. 'He was dressed as Herman Munster, known as the Frankenstein monster, while (a friend) was dressed in drag as Lily Munster, and (another friend) was dressed as Harry Potter.' Miss Baines said the defendant had asked the woman to go with him upstairs. The victim's and defendant's friends chatted upstairs throughout the evening, during which she told her friends: 'I think he's going to try something with me'. The married father, who admitted taking Viagra, was dressed as a Herman Munster for the event, Sheffield Crown Court was told . Miss Baines said: 'As they all left down the stairs, the defendant and the complainant were at the back of the group. 'The defendant put his arm across the stairs on the stairwell to stop her and indicated to her he wanted to go for a cigarette. 'She told him she didn't smoke but didn't want to kick up a fuss. The two went to an indoor smoking area in the club, which is an open air room in the club were people are permitted to smoke.' Miss Baines told the jury the defendant began to kiss the girl in the room, before sexually assaulting her and keeping her underwear 'to look after it for her'. In a video given as evidence in court, the woman told police: 'I just felt as though I was paralysed. I was so scared I didn't even know what to do. I knew what was going to happen.' The victim described how the defendant began to touch her and raped her. She said: 'He started having sex with me. I could see everything that was happening. I tried to look away but the walls were covered in mirrors so I had to watch everything.' The married father was performing alongside two other men dressed as Harry Potter in La Chambre, Sheffield, when he attacked the woman who was in fancy dress . The attack took place in a mirror-covered room.  The court heard it was 'the toxic combination of being in a place where sexuality, and sex itself, was paraded in front of him' that led Smith to rape the woman . The woman told police how she wanted her friends to come back and find her, which they later did. She went on: 'Just because of where it was it doesn't mean that gave him the right to do that to me. 'I didn't give him any indication I wanted to have sex with him that night. He shouldn't get away with what he's done.' The victim told the police that, as she was being raped, she thought: 'He was really, really tall and big in his platform soles. I thought My God where are my friends.' After the ordeal, the victim locked herself in a toilet and complained to management. Smith was later arrested. During the trial, Smith had claimed that any sexual activity was consensual. He said the woman had been flirting with him and they were getting on well. But a jury found him guilty of rape after nearly seven hours of deliberations. He was also ordered to sign the Sex Offenders' Register. After the trial, investigating officer PC Jessica Hawley, of South Yorkshire Police, said: 'South Yorkshire Police takes all reports of rape extremely seriously and will work tirelessly to bring offenders to justice. 'Smith denied the offence and forced his victim to relive her ordeal in court, which must have been incredibly hard for her. 'I would like to praise her for the tremendous courage and dignity she has shown during the investigation and court case. 'This man is now rightly starting a lengthy prison term and I hope today's sentencing allows the victim to move forward with her life.'","Jeremy Smith attacked the woman at La Chambre in Sheffield on Halloween .

Tory MP Sir Edward Leigh warned David Cameron against complacency in the run-up to the referendum on September 18 . Support for the Yes vote has surged following Mr Salmond's triumph in last week's TV debate against former Chancellor Alistair Darling, leader of the Better Together campaign. A YouGov survey for The Times and The Sun yesterday showed 48 per cent plan to vote No, 42 per cent back the Yes campaign and 10 per cent remain undecided. The shock surge in support for independence saw the pound tumble to nearly a five-month low and shares in some of Scotland's largest firms, including Royal Bank of Scotland and energy giant SSE, slid. Sterling fell almost a cent against the US dollar to $1.6510, close to a five-month low of $1.6501. It also slipped against the euro and traders warned it is likely to weaken further ahead of September 18. In Commons today, Sir Edward issued a dire warning about the risk of taking a No vote for granted. He told the PM: 'For all the reasons that have been given, if we were to lose the Union, it would be not only a disaster for Scotland, but a national humiliation of catastrophic proportions. 'I say gently to the three party leaders that perhaps we have been a bit complacent up to now. I urge them, over the next two weeks, to drop everything else and stand shoulder to shoulder to fight for the Union that we love and believe in.' Mr Cameron insisted that all party leaders in Westminster have 'put aside their differences and said that, in spite of the political differences we have, we all agree about one thing: not only is Scotland better off inside the United Kingdom, but the United Kingdom is better off with Scotland inside it'. Mr Cameron added: 'As well as being leader of the Conservative party and Prime Minister, I am the Member of Parliament for an English seat and I say on behalf of everyone in England and, I believe, in Wales and Northern Ireland, 'We want Scotland to stay.' Better Together leader Alistair Darling today said he is 'absolutely confident' that Scots will vote to stay in the UK but conceded the referendum campaign will be a 'race to the wire'. He brushed aside reports that a source in his Better Together campaign had conceded they could lose the historic ballot.  'That's rubbish, we will win,' he said on a visit to Aberdeen. Better Together leader Alistair Darling, pictured with Alexander Burnett  during a visit to HOBESCO Biomass Energy Centre near Banchory in Scotland, today insisted he still thinks voters will reject independence . At the beginning of August, 18 per of Labour supporters said they would vote Yes in the referendum, but the latest YouGov poll showed the figure had soared to 30 per cent . Tomorrow Labour leader Ed Miliband will head to Central Belt in a desperate attempt to persuade Scottish Labour voters to reject independence, as Alex Salmond woos Labour voters with a promise to end Tory rule north of the border. After a sharp rise in support for independence, Labour is drawing up urgent plans to 'unleash big beasts' such as Gordon Brown and former Home Secretary John Reid to help avert a crisis. Now the No campaign is to step up efforts to target Labour voters, who are said to be switching to back independence. At the beginning of August, 18 per of Labour supporters said they would vote Yes in the referendum, but the latest YouGov poll showed the figure had soared to 30 per cent. The proportion of women backing independence has also risen from 33 per cent to 42 per cent in a month. Ed Miliband, under fire for his absence, will this week divert a trip to Aberdeen to visit Glasgow . Labour strategists plan to send 'big beasts' Gordon Brown  (left) and former home secretary John Reid (right) to party heartlands . Mr Miliband will head to Scotland tomorrow, where he will make a visit to the Central Belt to issue a direct plea to Labour supporters to remain in the Union. At the same time, Mr Brown has agreed to step up his involvement in the battle against independence. The former Prime Minister is expected to attend events almost every day between now and the vote on September 18. Former Home Secretary John Reid will be sent to the party's Glasgow heartlands to help avert a crisis. Meanwhile Mr Salmond, and his deputy Nicola Sturgeon, will today target Labour voters in the Borders, Ayrshire and West Lothian. Scottish Finance Secretary John Swinney today claimed Prime Minister's Questions is a reminder to Scots that they are being governed by 'Tory-led governments people in Scotland don't vote for'. With the penultimate PMQs before the referendum taking place today, Mr Swinney said independence would switch hundreds of millions of pounds of spending from Westminster priorities to Scottish needs. 'The sight of Prime Ministers Questions in the House of Commons is a stark reminder of what a No vote means - Tory-led governments people in Scotland don't vote for, imposing policies we don't support and charging us for the privilege,' he said. 'A Yes vote means the opportunity to control economic and tax policy so that many more people in Scotland benefit from our wealth and vast natural resources. 'That's why we're better off with Scotland's future in Scotland's hands.' However, last night it emerged an independent Scotland would be blocked from joining the European Union if Alex Salmond ploughs ahead with his 'bonkers idea' of using the pound. The pound tumbled to a near five-month low on the shock poll showing a narrowing in the No campaign's lead . The latest YouGov poll shows a sharp narrowing in the lead for the No campaign ahead of the independence referendum on September 18 . Brussels chief Olli Rehn warned it 'would simply not be possible' to become an EU nation if Edinburgh did not have control of its own currency. Lib Dem Treasury minister Danny Alexander said the revelation meant an independent Scotland would have to choose between 'using the pound like Panama uses the dollar, or joining the EU'. Doubts about the currency Scotland would use if it leaves the UK have dominated the debate ahead of the independence referendum on September 18. Mr Salmond has insisted it would continue to use the pound, entering a currency union with the remaining countries in the Union. But Labour, the Tories and Lib Dems have all ruled out the plan, making it impossible whoever wins next year's Westminister general election. Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Euro until July this year, warned it 'would simply not be possible' to become an EU nation if Edinburgh did not have control of its own currency . In a speech last night Mr Alexander released details of a letter from Mr Rehn, who spent a decade as a European Commissioner, including four years as European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Euro until July this year. Mr Rehn insisted that any country which wants to join the EU must be 'committed' to the Economic and Monetary Union of the EU. It means they must have the 'will and expected capacity to meet the convergence criteria of euro membership in due course' as well as their own independent central bank. But if Scotland is using the pound governed from London, it will not have control of bits own currency. Mr Rehn added: 'As to the question whether 'sterlingisation' were compatible with EU membership, the answer is that this would simply not be possible, since that would obviously imply a situation where the candidate country concerned would not have a monetary authority of its own and thus no necessary instruments of the EMU.'","Ed Miliband to head north to win back Labour voters backing independence .

"By . Martha Cliff for MailOnline . In a world of constant complications sometimes the simplest solution can be the most effective, at least that's what one woman believes. Jane Hanson was so haunted by the escalating conflict in Syria growing unrest at home and globally that she was desperate to find a way to help bring peace to the world again and for her it was as simple as singing. Jane, who has sung in choirs for years, has witnessed the power that singing had on groups of people as a reporter for BBC World Service in numerous countries around the world. Jane Hanson hopes that by singing, members of the public can focus on harmony on World Peace Day . Inspired by the simple notion of singing as a group, Jane set up the One Day One Choir initiative, a global choral project for peace. The One Day One Choir project runs on the simple idea that singing as a group is one of the most unifying and harmonious activities known to mankind. Singing releases endorphins which help us to feel physically and mentally better and singing together makes people feel more connected. The project takes these basic principles and applies them to peace, at all levels. One Day One Choir.org simply asks people, of all ages and locations around the world, to sign up and sing in choirs, on Peace Day on 21 September. One Day One Choir are asking schools to dedicate songs or hymns in assemblies to peace . International Peace Day was established by the UN in 1981 as a day devoted to strengthening the ideals of peace within and among all nations and peoples. The idea behind the choirs is to help people to focus on peace, not just world peace but peace  at home, at school or work, in the community and around the world. The initiative is hoping to involve as many people as possible. The project is asking  schools to dedicate songs or hymns in assemblies or classrooms on the 19th, churches can dedicate their hymns on the Peace Day itself which is a Sunday. Mosques and temples can dedicate their chanted prayers on Friday, Saturday or Sunday and people anywhere else who are already singing or want to join in can just dedicate their rehearsals or performances. Jane has always believed that singing as a group is one of the most uplifting activities and can make people feel united . Fittingly for World peace the project is not confined to the UK with 16 different countries having already signed up to sing. By the centenary commemoration of the end of the war to end all wars in 2018 One Day One Choir is hoping to have the biggest choir in the world, singing for peace. Jane, who sings regularly with the London Philharmonic Choir hopes that the project will be both enjoyable but also focus people's minds. 'I was compelled to do something focused on peace. Something that would somehow be simple, uplifting and engaging, and that anyone, anywhere, regardless of age, belief or ability, could be a part of, together and have a voice in.' Raise your voice and join them by signing up to sing at www.onedayonechoir.org and follow us on Facebook and Twitter.","Jane Hanson created One Day One Choir .

"By . Leesa Smith for Daily Mail Australia . Ryan McCann has been questioned by police after drugs were allegedly found in the walls of his home . A successful Brisbane real estate agent has been questioned by police after drugs were allegedly found in the walls of his home. Ryan McCann, 36, was interviewed by police on Monday night after an operation that also included a search at his L J Hooker office in Cleveland, Channel Nine News reports. McCann was charged with 34 drug-related charges and will appear at Cleveland Magistrates Court on Tuesday. It will be alleged that as a result of a search warrant police located dangerous drugs at a Compass Court residence. The Redland City Bulletin reports detectives with sniffer dogs executed six search warrants after a year-long investigation into an alleged methamphetamine ring. In total, five men were arrested and are expected to be charged with up to 41 drug offences. His father, Patrick McCann, told The Courier-Mail his family was 'distraught' and 'very upset' at the situation. Mr McCann, who has represented LJ Hooker since 2007, was spruiked on the agency's website as having sold $40 million in property in the past 12 months. But Mr McCann's profile has since been taken off the site which previously claimed he had been rated in the top 15 agents in the country based on settled sales. The office at L J Hooker in Cleveland (pictured) was also searched as part the operation on Monday .

"By . James Tozer . Gregg Stevenson, who lost both his legs in Afghanistan, walks with the revolutionary Genium X3 knee - which is controlled by Bluetooth and uses Wii technology . A former soldier who lost both legs in Afghanistan has told how being fitted with the world’s most advanced bionic knee has transformed his life. Gregg Stevenson, 29, is the first wounded serviceman to wear  a ground-breaking prosthetic limb which has a Bluetooth remote control to switch from walking, jogging, cycling and even golfing modes. It can also automatically sense and react to his movements, enabling it to adapt seamlessly when he breaks out into a run or tackles a flight of stairs. The device is also waterproof, meaning he can keep it on in the shower or at the beach.Yesterday Mr Stevenson, who lives with wife Melanie and two-year-old son Harry in Foulridge, Lancashire, said the new limb would give him ‘almost complete freedom’. ‘Before, I had to switch between different knees for different activities – this is much, much easier,’ he said. ‘I feel blessed that I’ve regained this much mobility.’ Mr Stevenson was just a fortnight from the end of his first tour of duty with the elite 24 Commando Engineer Regiment supporting the Royal Marines in Helmand Province in 2009 when a Taliban IED exploded. He lost his left leg above the knee and his right leg just below it. Last month he was given the new Genium X model of knee, funded by the Ministry of Defence. The £70,000 limb, the first to be fitted in the UK, is programmed from a laptop and can be switched manually between different modes.But what makes it particularly ground-breaking is it also uses Wii-style sensors to anticipate when the wearer is breaking into a run – to catch a bus, for example – and adapts accordingly, just like a human leg. It was designed with the US military and was attached at Lancashire Teaching Hospital’s Specialist Mobility Rehabilitation Centre in Preston. Yesterday, Mr Stevenson said:  ‘I’ve just started kicking a football with my son. He will have to keep up with me now.’ He added: ‘Since I was injured, I haven’t been able to go back to work as an engineer because the prosthetic legs that I was using before really limited my movement, but now I’m hoping to get back to work. It’s fantastic.’ The limb, developed in part with the Ministry of Defence, can switch between modes to allow the user to perform several different everyday actions . The knee (pictured left on the nearest leg and right being adjusted) can change between modes - such as swimming, running, driving and biking, using a Bluetooth remote. Previously Mr Stevenson would have to change prosthetic in order to do different activities . A diagram showing the natural walking gait - or pattern - the wearer of the prosthetic will achieve. It is very similar to the gait of someone without a bionic limb . The full Genium X3 knee. Mr Stevenson is the first UK veteran to be fitted with the technology . The prosthetic was funded by the Ministry of Defence. The prosthetic is made from aluminium, steel and carbon fibre and costs £70,000. It . gives the wearer the most anatomically correct walking posture and . provides a similar gait - or walking pattern - to a human leg. The knee operation automatically bends when the user picks their foot off the ground - and so simulates natural walking style. It has a battery life of five days - much longer than any other previous models and is the first to be completely waterproof. It is the first prosthetic that allows the wearer to walk backwards and up stairs and over obstacles. It . is capable of doing several modes - including biking, golfing, driving, . walking and running - all of which are programmed in to the prosthetic . by a computer before fitting. The user can switch between modes using a . Bluetooth remote. The . knee also uses similar technology used in Wii gaming consoles and . smartphones to sense when the user is about to go change activity - and . so can automatically switch between walking and running modes. There is also a mute button so that it can be silenced for . things like meetings or trips to the cinema. The . war veteran said today the 'fantastic' prosthetic will give him 'almost . complete freedom' to play with his young son Harry, 2. He also hopes it . will mean he can return to work as an engineer. He . said: 'It feels fantastic, we’ll balanced and comfortable. I can now . walk up and down stairs, backwards and it’s waterproof which is really . important. 'It sounds like a small thing but I will be able to take Harry for swimming lessons and go to the beach. Mr Stevenson's new leg is programmed by a computer to execute a variety of settings. The father says he will have far more freedom to play with his child now he has the prosthetic . 'Before I had to switch between different knees for different activities, this is much, much easier. 'I’ve just started kicking a football with him and got him some mini golf clubs. Harry will have to keep up with me now.' Lancashire . Teaching Hospital’s Specialist Mobility Rehabilitation Centre (SMRC) in . Preston also became the first in the UK to fit the world’s most . advanced prosthetic knee. Mr Stevenson said: 'I am so pleased to be the first person to use this new leg and I am so grateful to the staff at the SMRC. 'Since . I was injured I haven’t been able to go back to work as an engineer . because the prosthetic legs that I was using before really limited my . movement, but now I’m hoping to get back to work. 'It’s . fantastic. The encouragement of my friends, family and the soldiers . from the regiment has been immense. I feel blessed that I’ve regained . this much mobility' Dr . Fergus Jepson, Consultant at the SMRC said: 'It’s so pleasing to see a . young man who is a double amputee, as a result of fighting for his . country, being given a new lease of life thanks to this amazing new . technology. We know how . much this will enhance Gregg’s life and give him new opportunities and . we are so proud to be the first centre in the UK to provide this piece . of kit for one of our patients.' In 2010 the Government announced plans to invest £15 million to support and improve prosthetic services for military veterans. Following this, staff at the SMRC have been working in partnership with . the Veteran’s Prosthetic Panel and Ottobock, who have designed the new . Genium X3 knee, to develop new prosthetic technology. The leg has previously only been used by a handful of veterans with similar disabilities in the USA. Materials:  Uses corrosion resistant materials such as titanium, hard . anodised aluminum, stainless steel, and coating.Waterproof: . The prosthetic has undergone stringent waterproof testing and is completely . submersible.Battery life: 5 . days. Charging point is at the back of the knee and . can even be charged through clothing. Sensors: The Genium X3 has additional sensors. From the moment the heel strikes the . ground until the toe lifts off, the sensors tell the microprocessor . exactly where the wearer is in the walking cycle, as well as measuring the . amount of force acting on the knee - helping give the user the . most natural movement possible. New technologies: An accelerometer and a gyroscope . intuitively know where the leg is in space, using the same technologies . from Wii gaming systems and smartphones, for a virtually natural gait. Activity modes: Offers five activity modes including –biking, . golfing, and more – activated using a key fob-sized remote. Run: Innovative Walk2Run mode detects . start-and-stop running - such as crossing a street or trying to catch a . bus.","Gregg Stevenson, 29, lost both legs in Kajaki, Helmand Province, in 2009 .

'As part of our enquiries, we are talking to people in the area to find out more about Pennie and the circumstances leading to her death. 'Understandably, people will have concerns and suspicions, but I would ask you to contact us with any information and please be aware that speculation, particularly on social media, is not always helpful. 'Pennie's death has also been felt across the wider community of horse riders and owners. 'While we can rule nothing out at this stage, there is no evidence of any harm to Sprattley, the horse Pennie was tending to at the time, or any other horses nearby.' Mrs Davis was discovered by her new husband Pete who is said to be distraught over his wife's murder . Speaking at the scene, Detective Superintendent Paul Barton, said Mrs Davis had been stabbed to death . Pennie's friend Nicola Crawford said she knew Pennie for the past five years and used to cut her hair. She said: 'Pennie started off as a customer but our friendship blossomed from there after I gave her one of my horses, Spratt, who she still had. She was so bubbly, quite loud, but absolutely lovely - she didn't have a bad bone in her body. Pennie was so full of life and I can't imagine why anyone would want to hurt her. 'She was a single mum for a long time, as long as I've known her, and did everything she could for her kids. 'For a long time she was lonely and her horses were her passion, but when she met Pete through a friend, everything seemed to have finally worked out for her.' Nicola Crawford, right, said her best friend Pennie Davies, left had finally found happiness with husband Pete . Ms Crawford said Mrs Davis had recently rented the field where she was murdered to keep her horses because it was near her new £185,000 four-bedroom house in Blackfield. She added: 'Pennie had a tough life but her and Pete were like peas in a pod and spent every possible moment together.He would often go up to meet her at the yard, which is when he would have found her. 'I just don't get what's happened. Pennie was very independent and would constantly visit the horses to give them hay but never spent hours up there as she was a busy working mum.'

Mrs Davis’s first husband David Colwell, 48, said she was a ‘kind hearted’ woman who loved her horses. ‘I was so shocked when I heard the news,’ the builder from Chichester said. ‘I was married to her years ago when I was in my 20s. It took me many years to get over her. It tore me apart. We split up because I think it just wasn’t what she wanted.’ Darren White, the Sainsbury’s Local store manager in Blackfield where Mrs Davis worked, said his staff had been plunged into a ‘day of sadness’. Friends said that Pennie Davis, pictured, was a keen horse woman who really enjoyed riding . Mr Pierce said he believed it was a 2002 transit van because of the shape. 'It is all pretty scary,' he added. Another resident said: 'It's a little strange, they seem to be saying it's murder which is unusual, nothing like that has happened in the 15 years I have lived here.' Police and forensics officers were seen at Leygreen Farmhouse, a B&B about a mile from the centre of the village. They searched nearby hedgerows and carried out door-to-door inquiries. The proprietor did not wish to comment. Village resident Hillary Gibbs said: 'It's horrifying. It's a picturesque village and a tight community. It's come as a dreadful shock.'

"By . Steph Cockroft for MailOnline . An internationally-acclaimed medic and his team of workers showed a 'cynical disregard' for the NHS by working just half their contracted hours in a scam which cost taxpayers £1.1m. The four top health experts, all from London, were employed by Basildon hospital in Essex on full-time salaries to provide expertise on operating heart and lung machines during operations. But the fraudsters billed the hospital for 14,000 hours that they never worked - while 'arrogantly flitting' across other NHS trusts in London making 'truck loads of cash' as private contractors. Their scam became such a cash cow that they secretly referred to the hospital as 'Bas Vegas' and set up a 'bonus points' in which they rewarded themselves for successfully carrying out the con. Martin Oliver, pictured left, and John Mulholland, pictured right, were two of the four fraudsters who conned £1.1m out of the NHS in a 'systematic, well-planned' scam in which they worked just half their contracted hours . 'Leader' John Mulholland, 41, a highly respected perfusionist who is published widely in academic journals, alone billed the NHS for more than £400,000 of work that was never done. All four defendants - all of whom were directors at a private company in London at the time - have now been jailed for a total of nine years for the 'systematic, well-planned' scam. Mulholland was jailed for three years while his co-defendants - Martin Oliver, 36, Ann Clements, 51, Tom Cumberland, 41 - were all handed two-year terms. They all worked as perfusionists - blood circulation specialists who operate heart and lung bypass equipment which keep patients alive during heart surgery. The shamed medics were convicted by a jury in July this year after a 13-week trial of one count of conspiracy to defraud the NHS between 2007 and 2011. Judge David Owen-Jones branded Mulholland the 'leader' of the fraud, saying there was 'no doubt' his involvement was 'greater than your co-directors'. He said: 'This was a systematic, well-planned and organised and executed deception by all of your over a significant period of time - four years, or so, in total. 'While taking a salary from the NHS for a 37-and-a-half hour week, you worked elsewhere at other hospitals during NHS hours. You all four gravely abused the trust placed in you. 'It's awful to see people of your education, previous good character and achievements convicted of these kinds. I feel these offences were motivated purely by greed.' The court heard that the four medics - who were directors at London Perfusion Science Ltd (LPS) - were contracted between 2007 and 2011. They were employed to provide clinical perfusion services to manage heart and lung machines during cardiac surgery at Basildon. But they failed to work their contracted hours, instead opting to make extra money at other hospitals, mainly Hammersmith. The four top health experts, all from London, were employed by Basildon hospital in Essex, pictured, on full-time salaries but 'arrogantly flitted' across other NHS trusts in London making 'truck loads of cash' During the four-year period, the fraudsters were overpaid by about £420,000, the court was told. The private work they charged for at other hospitals while they should have been at Basildon gave them a further £700,000. Basildon Crown Court was told how a series of damning e-mails led to the downfall of the medics. The defendants reminded each other in emails about doing 'face shows', which meant turning up to work every so often to stop staff becoming suspicious about their whereabouts . Opening the case earlier this year, prosecutor Shane Collery  told jurors: 'This is in many respects a sad case. It involves one of the perfusion medical teams at Basildon Hospital engaging in a fraud. 'They provided significant services to the public and were rewarded by a salary but it was not enough. 'They started to earn more by doing less and engaging in activities which stole from their employer, the public purse and from you.' In one of the crucial e-mails, Mulholland warned that care needed to be taken with the amount they were billing the NHS 'so as not to draw attention to the number of people we have doing nothing'. In May 2010, he also referred in an e-mail to how one of his team would 'continue to make us truck loads of cash paid for by Vegas'. One, sent by Mulholland to other defendants, revealed he tried to avoid NHS work 'unless it's going to make cash/make our lives easier'. And in another damning e-mail Clements sent to Mulholland, she said: 'Look at 'Bas' and the manipulation that we go through there to make it run without highlighting people are missing. 'That's why when you are there you make sure you talk to everybody you are high profile so you are noticed!' Mullholland was arrested by detectives as he arrived to attend a meeting at Basildon Hospital. Mr Benjamin Summers, mitigating for Mulholland, said he had a seriously ill young daughter who requires round the clock care for a chronic lung condition. Mulholland has also had to resign for a variety of highly respected roles within the industry and is highly likely to struggle to find work within the 'small community' when he leaves prison. He said: 'His career as a perfusionist is over - the destruction of that career in my respectful submission is utter and complete.' Dean Armstong, QC, on behalf of Clements, told the court: 'She was a high-class perfusionist, whatever the circumstances, she is a loss to the profession. 'She is a loss to the general public who will no longer be treated by her. She has lost her reputation - she has lost her good character.' Adam Kane, for Oliver, from East London, said it was a 'most unusual fraud case' in that the defendants had not achieved an easy life and were 'still working all the hours that God sends'. David Whittaker, for Cumberland, from Penge, said his client did not play a leading role in the scame. He now lives 'quietly' with his elderly mother in Anglesey and will never work within the industry again. All the defendants were banned from holding directorships of companies for four years. Two other junior colleagues from LPS charged with the same count were acquitted at the trial. After the hearing Sue Frith, head of the National Investigation Service at NHS Protect, said: 'From day one, John Mulholland and his associates set out to defraud the NHS of hundreds of thousands of pounds. 'The time, effort and planning that they were willing to put in to their criminal activities reaped them considerable rewards - until NHS Protect caught up with them.' 'These custodial sentences reflect the seriousness of the offences and will act as a powerful deterrent to others.' There will be a proceeds of crime hearing at a later date.","Experts were paid full-time salaries for 4 years at Basildon Hospital, Essex .

"By . Steph Cockroft for MailOnline . Former deputy head Tony Wheeler, 84, left his £3m fortune to 16 local charities, including the church in Sudbury where his family were life-long worshippers . A former deputy headteacher who died without any close relatives left his £3m fortune to charity, including more than £200,000 to the church where his family were life-long worshippers. Multi-millionaire Tony Wheeler died in June 2012, aged 84, after a battle with pancreatic cancer. Now it has emerged that Mr Wheeler left almost half of his fortune to 16 local organisations, including Sudbury's United Reformed Church. He left the other half to a long list of national charities which were close to his heart. Friends of the retired schoolmaster, who was described as a 'perfect gentleman', said they were stunned he had left so much money. The church secretary also said he was 'not even sure' if Mr Wheeler himself knew he had that much money saved away. Mr Wheeler, the former deputy headmaster at Royal Worcester Grammar School, spent much of his working life at the prestigious school. It is believed he saved up his millions through inheritance, as well as making 'bold' investments using the salary from his deputy's post. He retired to his home town of Sudbury, Suffolk, in 1987, but never married and did not have any close relatives. He lived modestly and did not smoke or drink. David Cocksedge, probate manager at legal firm Bates, Wells and Braithwaite, based in Sudbury, said Mr Wheeler had requested that virtually all of his money should go to national and local charities. Secretary of the United Reform Church Chris Proffitt said the £215,000 would be used for a number of projects, including lighting up the spire which Mr Wheeler liked to look at from his bedroom window. He said: 'No-one dreamt Tony had that amount of money and I'm not even sure if he knew that he had that much. 'It was a wonderful gift that has enabled us to make a significant improvement to our church hall. 'It's used by around 140 people each week and is the best facility in town, so we have regenerated it to make it much more user friendly. 'We have also illuminated the spire in Tony's memory, which he used to enjoy seeing from his bedroom window.' Mr Wheeler also donated £200,000 to Suffolk Wildlife Trust, which is using the money to buy a 78-acre extension at Assington, near Sudbury. Christine Luxton, head of development at the countryside trust, said: 'It's an amazing nature reserve and over the years we have extended it greatly through the generosity of people like Mr Wheeler. Mr Wheeler left £215,000 to Subury's United Reformed Church, some of which is being used to light up the spire which the keen historian could see from his bedroom window . 'When someone leaves us a legacy like this, we have a huge responsibility to do something fantastic with it. We chose this site because it was close to where Mr Wheeler lived and we felt it would connect to his life, but it is there for everyone to enjoy.' Gainsborough's House, the museum and art gallery at the birthplace of leading 18th century painter Thomas Gainsborough, was also given £105,000 by Mr Wheeler. The money has been used to extend its shop and a room in the house will also be named after Mr Wheeler. Mark Bills said: 'It was an extraordinary thing for someone to do and has made an enormous difference to us. 'The money has allowed us to think about moving forward and expanding. We are going to put up a thank you board and Mr Wheeler's name will be at the top.' Some of the other beneficiaries of Mr Wheeler's include The Eden Project in Cornwall, national charity The Salvation Army, and several other churches around the area, all of which were given £50,000. Mr Wheeler, a keen local historian, published a book exploring the origins of street names in Sudbury, entitled What's in a Name, just before he died. He left his extensive collection of maps and books to the Libraries Museums Records and Amenities Committee at Suffolk County Council. Mr Wheeler also left unknown sums to The RSPCA, Guide Dogs for the Blind Association, The Royal National Institute of Blind People, Jesus College Cambridge, the Suffolk Historic Churches Trust and Royal British Legion. As a special tribute to his family predecessors, £6,000 was left to provide commemorative seats in the town cemetery. He also made a number of £5,000 bequests to individuals.","Tony Wheeler, 84, from Sudbury, Suffolk, left thousands to 16 local charities .

"By . Emily Crane . and Sarah Michael for Daily Mail Australia . Australians may be allowed to purchase cars online from overseas dealers  under a radical new plan put forward by the federal government. The plan, which is expected to draw backlash from local car dealerships, would allow Australians to import their own cars as long as they were aligned with accepted international safety standards. The Coalition wants to remove current red tape and barriers that restrict people from buying new cars from overseas in a move that would aim to deregulate the automotive market for consumers. Scroll down for video . Australians may be allowed to purchase cars online from overseas dealers under a radical new plan put forward by the federal government . It comes as new car sales figures released on Wednesday showed demand for new cars had dropped 5.5 percent compared with last August. A discussion paper from the government says a review of the Motor Vehicle Standards Act needs to occur to stay updated with changes to the international automotive market, considering it was last reviewed 14 years ago. The Motor Vehicle Standards Act delivers national vehicle standards for new motor vehicles and regulates the first supply of used imported vehicles to the Australian market. 'At the moment there are certain schemes for importation, but it is very difficult and complicated and very bureaucratic,' Assistant Infrastructure Minister Jamie Briggs told The Australian. . Assistant Infrastructure Minister Jamie Briggs said certain schemes for importation were difficult and complicated, with only about 3,000 cars getting imported by individuals each year . The plan, which is expected to draw backlash from local car dealerships, would allow Australians to import their own cars as long as they were aligned with accepted international safety standards . There's currently only about 3,000 cars that get imported in Australia by individuals each year - people can't import their own vehicles unless they're given special approval. 'Why shouldn't consumers have the option to do that if there is no good safety reason why they can’t? There would be an element of buyer beware that people will need to be conscious of; it is a big purchase to buy something sight unseen.' The government's plan would give consumers access to vehicles at the lowest possible cost, including luxury vehicles, and would be from markets with right-hand drive vehicles like Britain, Japan, Indonesia, Thailand and India. The discussion paper considers a range of reform options including ideas put forward by the Productivity Commission in its Report on Australia's Automotive Manufacturing Industry. The Productivity Commission's proposal to reduce restrictions on second-hand imports is canvassed in the paper. A discussion paper from the government says a review of the Motor Vehicle Standards Act needs to occur to stay updated with changes to the international automotive market . Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe signed an economic partnership agreement back in July, which would see a reduced cost in Japanese cars. Australian Automobile Association chief Andrew McKellar said Japan was the largest source of imported vehicles in Australia and made up about 30 per cent of the market. 'We would estimate [the trade deal] would reduce the amount of tax payable on a new car by about $1000 to $2000,' Mr McKellar told Daily Mail Australia. 'For a larger vehicle like a [Toyota] Land Cruiser the saving is probably closer to $3000.' The government's plan would bring down the price of cars, including luxury vehicles, and would be from markets with right-hand drive vehicles like Britain, Japan, Indonesia, Thailand and India .","The federal government wants to cut red tape and allow individuals to purchase and import cars .

"By . Sally Lee for Daily Mail Australia . An Australian fashion label has caused a stir for their most recent campaign, which is modelled by a young girl with a skeletal figure. Manning Cartell subscribers recently received an email containing the three images of the skinny model. The 'disturbing and distressing' photos were posted on news website Mamamia on Wednesday, reigniting the debate on the fashion industry's role in promoting unhealthy bodies. Manning Cartell subscribers recently received an email containing the three images of the skinny model . The model poses three different looks while she wears a two-piece set which exposes her emaciated limbs. Website founder Mia Freedman expressed her frustration at the images, describing them as 'the body of a girl who looks like a starving child'. Mamamia founder Mia Freedman is outraged by the fashion industry's lack of action against emancipated models . 'How astonishing is it that nobody involved in this shoot stopped to say, ""Hang on. This girl looks incredibly underweight. The clothes literally bunch and hang off her emaciated limbs, child-like torso and non-existent hips. Is that the message we want to send to our customers and the world about our brand?"",' she wrote. One reader, Julie, shared Freedman's outrage. 'Absolute joke! When will the fashion industry wake up! Stop using skinny models that perpetuate false images that girls try to live up to,' she said in response to the Mamamia post. Another reader, 'Redqueen', wrote: 'What this industry is really saying is: ""you can't sit with us until you reach a size 0"". They know most women will never look like the stick figures featured in these magazines, it's a never ending treadmill keeping women feeling s**t about themselves.' Others were more sympathetic towards the model and her size. 'I can't believe people are upset over this girl's body. She is obviously a slim build but does not look dangerously unhealthy,' Liz wrote. 'I look like the girl in the ad. Naturally. I eat, I exercise to keep strong and I just can't gain weight. I find things like this so offensive. I'm sitting here now wondering if people think I'm sick...""or just stupid."" I'm neither!' Lala wrote. Cassi Van Den Dungen made headlines earlier in the year when she walked for Australian designer Alex Perry's show at the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in Sydney . The 21-year-old looked revealed her slim legs, protruding elbow joints and sunken cheeks . Earlier this year, the body image debate was reignited after a gaunt looking Cassi Van Den Dungen faced backlash after walking for Australian designer Alex Perry's show at the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in Sydney in April. The 21-year-old looked dramatically thinner than her teenage self, where she first appeared on television series Australia's Next Top Model, as she revealed her slim legs, protruding elbow joints and sunken cheeks. Freedman dubbed the show: 'The hunger games', while Jackie Frank, editor-in-chief of Marie Claire was compelled to phone one model's agent to inquire after her health . Perry later admitted he was wrong to put models like Cassi Van Den Dungen on the runway. He added that everyone in the fashion industry needs to work together to make a difference. However since then, Freedman believes nothing's changed. In Australia, there's currently no code of conduct which requires a certain average Body Mass Index  for models. The World Health Organisation considers a BMI below 16 as starvation. Manning Cartell was founded in 2005 by Sydney sisters Cheryl, Vanessa and Gabrielle Manning. A spokeswoman for Manning Cartell is yet to respond to Daily Mail Australia.","Manning Cartell subscribers recently received an email containing images of a skinny model .

Floodwater gushes out of the Three Gorges Dam as the gates were opened to discharge floods for first time this year, at the vast Yangtze River, in Hubei, China . Heavy rains are pushing water levels at the Three Gorges Dam past the flood level limit. Sluice gates of the world's biggest hydropower project were opened earlier today . It is being reported that the miners were in a four-story dormitory building when the landslide hit. Fifteen of them managed to escape but the rest were buried in a mine shaft where they had been taking shelter, according to state television. It is thought rescue workers were able to save one miner who was sent to a local hospital where he remained in stable condition. Rain began to lash the southwest region on Sunday and firefighters and police have been assisting to evacuate thousands of people from nine flooded towns in the Yunyang county. Roads were turned to rivers as motorists struggled to stop their cars from being washed away and fleets of vehicles were left abandoned in the town square.

Plumber Polly, 46, from Kendal, Cumbria, was working at the wedding of John Simpson and Nicole Rothwell at their home in Ecclerigg, on the shores of the lake Windermere. She was helping a friend who organised firework displays and was killed in the ensuing blaze. Another man - yet to be identified - also died. Mrs Connor leaves behind her husband Damien and three children Molly, 15, Daisy, 13, and Oscar, 10. Loss: Accident: A woman killed in an explosion at a firework display on Saturday has been named as  Polly Connor. The victim (right) is pictured with her husband Damien and children Molly, 15, Daisy 13 and Oscar, 10 . Fire rampaged through outbuildings at the wedding reception in Windermere, Cumbria, on Saturday afternoon . Polly's mother, stepfather and brother all heard the blast and saw white smoke rising from the site, but it was only later in the day that they learned what had happened. Her brother Russell Colman, of Bowness, had been at his photographic studio on the edge of Windermere with his mother Penny Benson and stepfather John Benson. Mr Colman said: 'We heard the explosion. It sounded like thunder, very loud. But then we realised it was something else. Moments later we saw white smoke,' he said. 'It wasn't until I got a phone call in the evening asking me to go urgently to Polly's house that I put it all together in my head.' Accident: A woman killed in an explosion at a firework display on Saturday has been named as mother-of-three Polly Connor. Polly, 46, had been working at the wedding of John Simpson and Nicole Rothwell at their home . Mrs Benson paid tribute to her daughter. 'She was our sunshine and now she's disappeared,' she said. 'You always felt better for seeing her. We are incredibly proud of her. 'All the tributes that have come in are exactly how she was and we are so incredibly grateful for that. 'She worked so hard and put 100 per cent into everything she did. She thought of others before herself all the time. 'But she was a girly girl, she loved dressing up and going out dancing with her friends. 'I just can't describe how much we will miss her and how much grief we feel at her loss. 'She was adored by everyone, especially Damien and her children. She was wonderful, a person with a beautiful spirit who will be terribly missed.' Mrs Connor's mother Penny Benson said: 'She was our sunshine and now she's disappeared' Mrs Connor ran her own plumbing business called 'Polly the Plumber' and was at the event in an official capacity working with a colleague. She had worked with the man in construction but he also organised firework displays at public events. Polly's brother, photographer Russell Colman said: 'She had done this sort of thing before and I know that when they worked together they worked incredibly carefully. 'We are just devastated at this time. 'Growing up, we were like the three amigos: mum, Polly and me. She was little but so tough. She wasn't just the glue or the rock or the scaffolding to her family. She was the whole world to them.' She met her husband Damien, a former jockey, also 46, while working in the racing industry . Mrs Connor was a former clerk of the course for the Macau Jockey Club and had worked internationally as a rider and head groom at racing stables all over the world. She met her husband Damien, a former jockey, also 46, while working in the racing industry. They moved to Kendal 10 years ago where she retrained as a plumber at night school while bringing up her family and after establishing her business worked as plumber across the construction industry as well as for private clients. Stepfather John Benson said she was humble and modest about her many talents and had an unmistakable laugh. He said: 'She brought everything together in the most remarkable way. She was lovely, delicate and a girly but also a tomboy. 'It's hard to describe someone with such an opposing combination of characteristics but in Polly, there there were. 'We're just so upset we can't say any more.' Guests at the reception on the shores of Lake Windermere fled in terror when they heard the explosion and saw smoke and fireworks, shortly after the bride and groom had posed for photographs on Saturday afternoon. Around 70 guests were mingling in the marquee of the countryside wedding venue when there was an 'enormous explosion' as fireworks went off in a nearby outbuilding, sparking a huge fire, witnesses said. The area was evacuated and the celebration had to be cancelled as firemen rushed to the reception, being held at a beauty spot yards from Lake Windermere in Cumbria. Insurance firm boss John Simpson, 61, married Nicole Rothwell, 44, and were holding the reception in the grounds of their lakeside home when the first started at 3.35pm on Saturday. Stepfather John Benson said she was humble and modest about her many talents and had an unmistakable laugh . Mrs Connor was a former clerk of the course for the Macau Jockey Club and had worked internationally as a rider and head groom at racing stables all over the world. They are believed to have had a register office ceremony earlier in the week and held the party to celebrate it with family and friends on Saturday. One of the musicians, who asked not to be named, said: 'It was a beautiful day and we were playing on the terrace just after the photographs were taken. 'The bride was in her gown in the garden with the groom and the fireworks just started going off. The flaming debris was falling all around. 'The firework display was spectacular, but we were wondering why it was being held in the bright daylight. 'Then we realised something shocking had happened. We grabbed our instruments and ran.' He said 'everyone was in complete shock' and the bride was 'obviously extremely upset.' Moment of terror: This picture shows the moment fireworks exploded at a wedding reception, killing two . Scene: There were around 70 guests in the marquee, pictured, when the fireworks suddenly exploded . Neighbour Enid Battersby said: 'All of a sudden there was an enormous explosion. I have never heard anything like it since the blitz in Manchester.' There then followed loud 'booms and pops' and thick smoke could be seen. It is understood there was going to be a big fireworks display later in the evening as the grand finale of the wedding celebration. Tourist Anthony Middleton was at the nearby Brockhole Visitor Centre with his family when they saw fireworks shooting into the sky. Panic: Police and firemen interviewed the 70 wedding guests who had been in the marquee at the time . He said: 'We heard this almighty explosion and the best way to describe that would be a series of earth-shaking cannons going off. 'The ground was shaking. We looked up and saw exhibition fireworks illuminating the daytime sky. That was followed by thick grey smoke and we obviously realised there was a fire nearby. 'Explosions were going off all the time, we could see the fireworks coming out from behind the trees. It appeared to us the fireworks had been stored in this wooden building that was on fire. 'We realised something disastrous was taking place. I could almost feel the heat of the fire.' Another witness from the visitor centre said: 'There was an explosion that sounded like thunder and then lots of fireworks went off. There were clouds of black smoke, we had no idea what happened.' Explosion: The bride and groom were in the garden when flaming debris started to fly in their direction . The national park visitor centre at Brockhole was packed with hundreds of tourists enjoying the last weekend of the summer holidays. Stuart Halliwell, the operations manager on the site, said one of his staff helped evacuate wedding reception guests away from the fire scene. He said: 'It must have been awful for the couple on their special day. It is obviously a tragedy but we could have been even worse than it was.' A fire service spokesman said four fire engines were sent to the scene to tackle a 'well developed fire involving the two outbuildings.' A Cumbria Police spokesman said they were called after a 'shed containing fireworks was on fire.' A vehicle nearby was also damaged by the blaze. Investigation: The man and woman have yet to be identified and police stayed late at the scene investigating . 'Two bodies, believed to be a male and a female, were found. Police and the fire service are investigating the circumstances that led to the fire.' Detective Chief Inspector Mike Brown said: 'We are still trying to examine the circumstances and the cause of the fire.' Mr Simpson was a partner in a local insurance company which he co-founded 30 years ago.","Polly Connor was killed in a blaze sparked by a fireworks explosion .

"By . Steph Cockroft for MailOnline . Passengers  waiting at a tram stop were given a shock - when a Nissan Micra pulled up to give them a lift instead. The car ended up unexpectedly parked at Oldham King Street Metrolink stop, Oldham, after veering off the nearby road onto the tracks. Several passengers waiting at the stop tried to help to move the car, before police and firefighters arrived at the scene. Wrong carriage: This Nissan Micra ended up on the tracks at Oldham King Street Metrolink stop, Oldham . But the incident caused the next and final service from the stop to be cancelled. The incident also had a knock-on effect on overnight engineering works. Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of drink-driving at the scene. He has been bailed until a later date. A woman passenger was taken to hospital after the incident as a precaution, but police said that no-one had been injured. A photo of the car parked up on the tracks was soon posted by a witness on Facebook. Metrolink, which runs the service, said the control room received a call from a waiting passenger who had used the  emergency call point at the stop. The person reported that the car had been driven onto the inbound track, heading towards the city centre, at around 11.30pm. A spokesman for tram operator Metrolink RATP Dev Limited said: 'The next and last service to travel that evening into the city centre from the Oldham King Street stop was held immediately at Oldham Central and any remaining passengers were asked to make alternative arrangements to their journey. 'The police were notified immediately and arrived on site to remove the passengers from the car.' A spokesman for the tram operator said the next and last service from the stop, pictured above, was cancelled that evening. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of drink-driving and has been bailed . A recovery vehicle removed the car at around 1am, after the incident on August 24. Engineers inspected the track for damage, but said it was superficial. It's not the first time a car ended up on the wrong side of the tracks in the area. In March, trams between Eccles and Ashton-under-Lyne were delayed when a car ended up on tracks near the Holt Town stop on the Ashton line. In January, tram bosses faced calls to improve signage after an elderly woman drove a high-powered Jaguar onto the tracks. Witnesses said the 76-year-old continued down the line in Beswick for more than 200 yards. The woman was not hurt but trams on the line between Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester were halted for more than an hour. It was revealed last June how gran Marie Smith drove her Nissan Qashqai 200 yards up the line at the same spot and was also rescued. She blamed a lack of clear signs on Ashton New Road for the confusion. And last October, a gold Citroen was driven onto the tracks outside a new Ashton-under-Lyne stop opposite Ikea just one week before its official opening. Some of the lines are mostly street-running which has caused confusion for some drivers.","The vehicle drove onto tracks at Oldham King Street Metrolink stop, Oldham .

Members of the Royal Southern Yacht Club and Island Sailing Club faced off in their annual grudge and managed to battle it out for at least an hour before the waves washed in and swamped the pitch. Bramble Bank is a sandbar in the centre of the Solent - the stretch of water between the Isle of Wight and the Hampshire coastline. It is uncovered only once a year - for about an hour - when the lowest tide reveals a temporary 200-metre-long 'pitch'. During that time the two sides, the Royal Southern Yacht Club, from Hamble, Hampshire and the Island Sailing Club, from Cowes on the Isle of Wight, sail out from the opposite coasts for their match.

"By . Leon Watson for MailOnline . A council has been blasted after warning undertakers it can only cremate one obese person a day on health and safety grounds. South Lanarkshire Council have written to funeral directors informing them they can only accommodate one service a day for people weighing over 21 stone. They said the extra workload involved and 'health and safety issues' meant that overweight people had to be cremated before 11am at their crematorium in Blantyre. South Lanarkshire Council has written to funeral directors with new rules banning them from cremating more than one obese person a day . The crematorium can cater for coffins weighing up to 45 stones but have said only one casket will be accepted each day. The move has been criticised by funeral directors who say it is discriminating against the families of overweight people. Andrew Ironside, who runs a funeral directors in Biggar, said: 'To me the council are discriminating against people who are over that particular weight. 'In fact with the weight of the coffin it will be people who are 20 stone and over. I think if they were challenged legally I don't see how it would stand up in court. 'I don't like it and I think it is very unfair that funeral directors will have to tell bereaved families that their loved ones can't be cremated on a particular day because of these guidelines.' In a letter sent to local undertakers, Danny Maxwell, the council's bereavement service manager, said: 'When receiving heavy coffins into the crematorium we must follow certain procedures to ensure a dignified service is given to both the deceased and their family. While a standard casket typically measures between 24 and 27 inches wide, manufacturers are now producing boxes as wide as 52 inches, capable of fitting a person weighing up to 1,000 pounds . 'There are also certain health and safety as well as manual handling issues that have to be considered. 'The instructions from the manufacturers are that cremations of a larger size should be the first cremations of the day. 'As we have a policy of not holding the deceased to the day after the service please note that the latest service will be 11am for a funeral service when the deceased is 140kg/21 stone or more.' Critics have also pointed out that the policy will punish families from rural parts of Lanarkshire who will have to travel long distances to services early in the morning. Funeral directors have previously told how they have been forced to call in fire fighters and cranes to move supersize coffins. Mourners have also been asked to sign waivers preventing them from suing for compensation if they injure themselves while carrying mammoth coffins . Stephen Kelly, the council's head of facilities, waste and ground services, said: 'We are one of the few councils in the country with capacity for larger coffins up to the maximum weight of 285kg/45 stones. 'There has been no change in our policy, however, we are reminding funeral directors that when receiving heavy coffins we must follow certain procedures to ensure a dignified service is given to both the deceased and their family. 'As with all services at the crematorium we will work with funeral directors to facilitate any request from bereaved families. 'We can, in certain circumstances, facilitate two funerals for larger coffins on the same day. 'This is subject to certain health and safety and SEPA regulations together with manufacturer's instructions that we must follow as the cremations process requires to be started from a lower than normal cremation temperature.'","South Lanarkshire Council write to funeral directors with new rules .

"By . Matt Chorley, MailOnline Political Editor . Schoolchildren returning to classrooms should be banned from choosing where they sit, under government rules. Ministers say teachers should decide a seating plan for pupils and not just let youngsters pair up with friends. Hardline guidance from Whitehall also includes threats of Saturday detentions, litter picking and writing out lines, and a demand for textbooks to be used instead of scruffy, photocopied worksheets. Ministers have told teachers to take a tougher line on discipline, imposing a strict seating plan from the start of term and threatening pupils with Saturday detentions, writing lines or picking up litter . Millions of children return to lessons this week after their six week summer holiday. Securing a good seat in the classroom used to be a key battle on the first days of term. But ministers now say teachers must intervene and choose where every pupil sits. Such a policy will stop disruptive pupils hiding at the back of the room, break up cliques of friends and ensuring the year groups chatterboxes are kept apart. Tory education minister Lord Nash said: ’The Department believes that teachers should have a plan for pupil seating arrangements in classrooms, rather than leaving it to pupil preference or chance. ’Where and how pupils are seated will depend entirely on the lesson and its objectives. Teachers are best placed to take these decisions,' he said, in a series of responses to parliamentary questions. The instructions are just the latest in a raft of rules designed to encourage teachers to take a stricter line on discipline. It follows a survey which found one in three secondary school teachers ’lacked confidence in their powers to discipline pupils’. As a result, new advice has been issued spelling out punishments teachers can use to bring pupils into line. They include litter picking in the playground, removing graffiti and writing lines. The Department for Education has also issued examples of how ’good schools manage behaviour’. One radical idea is forcing children to attend school detentions on Saturdays, while others tell teachers and senior staff to be more ’visible’ during the school day. ’We remain determined to support schools in providing safe, calm and orderly classrooms where pupils can learn effectively, Lord Nash added. Education minister Lord Nash said a return to textbooks would support the introduction of the new, tougher national curriculum . Teachers are also told to ditch worksheets and return to traditional textbooks as part of the new national curriculum. It includes children aged five having to recite poetry by heart, 11-year-olds will sit maths exams without calculators and teenagers will study at least two Shakespeare plays. Computer programming will be taught from five to 14, and foreign languages will be made compulsory at primary school. There will be a new emphasis on spelling and grammar, and history will focus on the story of Britain. Lord Nash said: 'The Department for Education has made it clear that a return to textbooks would support the new national curriculum. 'High-quality textbooks can prevent teachers from spending unnecessary time creating plans from scratch, and provide well-planned stretching activities for pupils.'","Department for Education tells teachers to use seating plans in lessons .

"By . Deni Kirkova for MailOnline . A pensioner just weeks from her 70th birthday is a real high flyer... but we're not talking about her career. At the age of 69 Gill Williams, from Cardiff, has long since retired from her job in financial services. These days the pensioner likes nothing better than swinging from a trapeze at circus school. Gill Williams, 69, a trapeze artist with No Fit State circus, and likes nothing better than throwing herself around . While many elderly people wouldn't dream of such daring exploits for fear of the physical demands required, Gill is something of an anomaly - and that's just the way she likes it. She attends circus skills classes at the HQ of world-renowned Cardiff-based NoFit State Circus twice a week. 'I started circus skills and aerial work, which is my favourite, just before turning 50,' she recalls. related] . 'I saw an advert in Eastern Leisure Centre for a trapeze class run by No Fit State who had been going for about eight years by then. 'It was a class for children, so I called and said, ""I'm a 50-year-old adult"". 'There was a sharp intake of breath on the other end of the line, but the instructor said there were only 14 spaces, so we should wait and see if all the spaces got taken up.' Gill attends circus skills classes at the HQ of Cardiff-based NoFit State Circus twice a week . As luck would have it, Gill received a call to partake in the class - and when she arrived the only other adults there were parents ready to watch their children pick up circus tricks. 'I squatted on the floor with the other children and the instructor said, ""I wondered if you were going to look like an old granny"". Coming from anyone else, that would have been rude, but it was so funny. 'It was a very hard class, but such fun. Exercising with young people was and is still very liberating.' Hanging upside down from ropes might not be every pensioner's idea of fun, however Gill's agility has come as no surprise to her friends and family. She took up rollerblading at 55 and there are plenty of other adventures she would like to have a go at before she thinks of winding down. Her husband Cliff - with whom she celebrated 50 years of marriage this year - gets a similar thrill from surfing and windsurfing. Gill says exercising with young people was and is still very liberating . As a child growing up in the Rhondda Valley, Gill longed to do gymnastics, but didn't have much opportunity to partake in her passions - instead she took piano lessons at the insistence of her father. However, it was when she hit 40 that her life took a turn. An article about cancer patients had a profound emotional impact and made Gill realise it was time she started looking after herself, taking care of her body and fitness. Now retired, Gill, who begins her eighth century in November, regularly goes to the gym - when she's not flying on a trapeze of course. She has also practised yoga for years and with regular swimming and running, exercises up to five times a week. And for the future? Well she's going to keep on keeping on. To this inspirational woman, age really is just a number. 'Many people think that just because they're getting old that should stop them from exercising. I'm proof that if you look after yourself, you can achieve whatever you want.' To find out more about classes at NoFit State visit the website at nofitstate.org .

"By . Alex Lazcano for Daily Mail Australia . A group of primary school kids on an excursion were caught in the middle of a mid-air scare onboard a Qantas plane from Canberra to Perth. The children were seated at the back of the plane causing the nose's weight to be higher due to the brunt of the weight being held in the front. Although pilots managed to rectify the situation and take off a report was released by the Australian Transport and Safety Bureau. Quantas check in staff have introduced a new check in procedure after the the mid-flight scare in a Canberra to Perth flight . The school group were seated with their chaperones at the back of the plane and assigned adult standard seated which should hold a standard 87kg adult. The children were all over the age of 11 which is above the age child seats are assigned. There was quite a serious discrepancy of 55kg per seat each child was was assigned to while majority of the adult passengers were given seats at the front of plane. The aircraft appeared nose-heavy during take-off, forcing the captain to apply significant back pressure to achieve lift off from the runway. Off the mark: The final load sheet of the Canberra to Perth flight overstated the aircraft take-off weight by about 3.5 to five tonnes . 'Qantas has worked with the ATSB to investigate a weight and balance anomaly on a Canberra to Perth flight,' a Qantas spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. 'The investigation found that due to an administrative error, the weight of some passengers was incorrectly recorded as adults rather than children.' 'This meant that the aircraft didn’t have the optimum configuration for takeoff, but at no stage was this a material risk to passenger safety.' An investigation by the Australian Transport and Safety Bureau was led after the incident, which found  87 primary school children on were assigned the adult weight of 87kg . Too much back pressure could have caused the aircraft tail to strike the runway, but the captain managed to ease the aircraft into the air. The incident, prompted an investigation by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. It was subsequently determined that the final load sheet overstated the aircraft take-off weight by about 3.5 to five tonnes. The Australian Transport and Safety Bureau said Qantas issued a new procedure to check-in staff, reminding them to ensure that children travelling on group bookings must be recorded as children, to ensure aircraft weight and balance is based on an accurate passenger type. The new procedure ensures that children travelling on group bookings must be recorded as children, which will ensure an accurate passenger weight assessment .","Primary school children caused a mid-flight scare on a Qantas plane .

"By . Alex Lazcano for Daily Mail Australia . A disgruntled staff member at an Outback Steakhouse restaurant has posted a complaint made by a guest that the staff member's accents weren't Australian enough. The complaint read that the customer was 'not satisfied' with the restaurant because 'nobody spoke Australian.' Outback Steakhouse is actually an American franchise with 116 restaurants around the world, including seven in Australia. The accent complaint doesn't state which restaurant the complaint was made about. Reddit user themeandoggie uploaded this complaint they received at the Outback Steakhouse they work at . The complaint posted to Reddit by user themeandoggie on Monday was made on August 19. The caption attached to the post reads: 'I work at an outback. someone actually complained about this.' A manager from an Outback Steakhouse, who wished to remain anonymous told Daily Mail Australia: 'It makes no sense, if anyone complains about an accent I'd be questioning that.' 'The brand Outback Steakhouse isn't Australian, it's from America, and we have restaurants around the world not just in Australia,' he said. 'We hire staff from all nationalities and who have different accents, there is no one Australian accent.' The Outback Steakhouse website describes their restaurants as: 'Outback Steakhouse is an Australian steakhouse restaurant.' 'The Company's strategy is to differentiate its restaurants by emphasizing consistently high-quality food and service, generous portions at moderate prices and a casual atmosphere suggestive of the Australian Outback.' Outback Steakhouse has been accused by a customer of their staff not having Aussie enough accents . The steakhouse's website also states that the brand is owned by OSI Restaurant Partners, LLC, headquartered in Tampa, Florida. 'It was probably a comment that was made in passing but holds not much value to us,' said the restaurant manager. 'In a way it saddens me as a person who has immigrated to Australia. I'm Australian but would they not consider me that because I don't have the accent they deem Australian?' The restaurant manager also stated that Outback Steakhouse performs rigorous tasks in reading, writing and mathematics as well as a face-to-face interview to ensure the staff are able to perform to an outstanding level. 'We want to provide the best service possible to our customers, and that has nothing to do with our backgrounds or our accents.'","A customer left feedback at an Outback Steakhouse that the staff didn't 'speak Australian'

A hovercraft pilot appeared in court today accused of being nearly three times over the drink drive limit while in charge of a busy Isle of Wight passenger vessel. Richard Pease, 50, fell ill at the helm of the Hovercraft Freedom 90 carrying 36 passengers, leaving one of his colleagues to step in and take over the controls as it travelled from Portsmouth, Hampshire. Pease, from Cowes, Isle of Wight, was later arrested under the Railway and Transport Safety Act 2003. Tests allegedly revealed he had 96 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of his breath. The legal drink-drive limit is 35. He appeared in front of Isle of Wight Magistrates' Court in Newport today charged with driving a motor vehicle while over the alcohol limit and contravening Merchant Shipping regulations by failing to present for duty free from alcohol. Prosecutor Sunyana Sharma told the court Pease was in 'sole control' of the vessel, which can take up to 127 passengers, as it journeyed to Ryde on the island. She said Pease was the only person responsible for controlling the vessel during the incident on June 22, 2014. 'The defendant was the master and pilot of the Hovercraft Freedom 90. He is an experienced driver of some 18 years,' she told the court. 'On the day in question...he was the individual in sole control of the hovercraft and driving.' Pease, who wore a  suit and blue tie as he stood in the dock, did not enter a plea. Magistrates adjourned the case and released Pease on unconditional bail for a hearing at Newport Crown Court on September 8. Hovertravel, which runs the service, is the world's longest running commercial hovercraft service and is the only scheduled passenger hovercraft service in the Europe.

It is believed that the couple then . skipped an arranged dinner with Ms Schroder's family, who were also . travelling on the Carnival Spirit liner. A source told the Sydney Herald the couple frequently had short but heated fights that would last about five minutes. 'It was a common occurence between them,' said the source. Scroll down for video . Fall: Paul Rossington, 30, and Kristen Schroder, 27 were arguing on the Carnival Spirit liner hours before they fell from the ship off the New South Wales coast . Senior police sources revealed that . CCTV footage captures Ms Schroder fall from the ship first, with her . paramedic boyfriend following. Further footage shows Ms Schroder hit a lifeboat before her body hit the water. The couple had been travelling with a group of friends and family on the Carnival Spirit liner. The massive sea and air search for the . pair was called off yesterday. Authorities were said to be looking at the . theory that Miss Schroder fell first and her panic-stricken boyfriend . then jumped in to try to save her. 'Paul was trying to save her,' a source who asked not to be identified told the Australian Associated Press. Security footage on the boat is said to show the pair falling overboard from the mid-deck of the boat as it travelled down the New South Wales' mid-north coast just before 9pm local time on Wednesday. Tweet: Ms Schroder (right) wrote on her Twitter feed of her excitement about the holiday days before they boarded the cruise liner . Investigation: Police officers investigate the cruise ship's balcony where the couple fell overboard on Wednesday evening. they are reviewing CCTV footage for evidence . A passenger looks at the view as a police officer inspects the balcony. Safety barriers on the ship are said to include an 2.5m barricade . Initially police were unable to determine who had fallen into the sea first, but after the footage had been enhanced, they could see that it was estate agent Miss Schroder who plunged first from the 65ft-high deck, followed about 20 seconds later by her boyfriend. They were reported missing 12 hours later after the boat had docked at Sydney's Circular Quay at the end of its 10-day cruise. Staff noticed the couple had failed to collect their luggage when the rest of the 2,680 passengers disembarked. Survival expert Dr Paul Luckin said if the couple, from Barraba, near Tamworth in NSW, had survived the impact of hitting the water, fatigue would be their biggest problem. Dr Luckin, who advises the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) said he would not expect anyone to last as long as three days after falling from a ship. He told the Sydney Herald: 'If you're stuck in the water and constantly being hit in the face by water, that is tremendously fatiguing... 'It will certainly be under three days that you would expect somebody to survive without water in those conditions.' Holiday: The couple was on holiday with a group of seven relatives and friends when they went missing on Wednesday night . Mr Rossington, a paramedic, and his . girlfriend had been on holiday on the cruise around the Pacific Islands . with a group of seven relatives and friends. Their cabin on the ship remains sealed off while forensic officers inspect it, although the ship did set sail from Sydney on its next cruise at 6.30pm last night. NSW police marine area commander Mark . Hutchings said the couple's fall was not believed to be suspicious, and . officers were inspecting the ship's CCTV footage. He said: 'It’s very unclear, but it does depict one person going over and then a short time (later) another person going over.' The ship was about 120km (75 miles) off the coastal town of Forster when the couple plunged into the sea. A statement released by Carnival Cruise Lines said: 'As part of our standard protocol, a full ship search was conducted as well as examination of closed circuit video. 'There is indication from the shipboard video of what transpired. 'There is no evidence of foul play.  However, out of respect for the families, we are not going to publicly disclose the details of what occurred.' The firm's spokesman said the rails on the cabin balconies are higher than the required standard. CCTV: Police studying enhanced CCTV footage from the ship's cameras believe Miss Schroder fell into the sea first . Carnival Cruise Lines, operated by Miami-based Carnival Corp, has been beset by a . series of problems and onboard crimes including power outage, rape, . sickness and theft. Several lawsuits have been launched against Carnival - but whether complainants will have any success is doubtful as the cruise company has a legal structure that shields it from big-money lawsuits.

"By . Alasdair Glennie Tv Correspondent . The BBC is planning to put more programmes online before they are shown on TV – but admits it needs to find another £100million a year in savings to fund it. In his first speech since becoming Director-General six months ago, Tony Hall said he wants the corporation to cater for a ‘new audience’ of younger viewers and listeners. He said his ambition was to double the BBC’s global audience to half a billion by 2022 by increasing the output of global news services, and to turn iPlayer into ‘the best online TV service in the world’. iPlayer: The BBC is planning to put more programmes online before they are shown on TV . His digital revolution will also include an iTunes Store-style website and a music streaming service, and plans to make the free iPlayer radio app globally available. There will be a crackdown on licence-fee evaders, while other BBC services would have their budgets slashed in order to pay for the plans. Lord Hall made his speech, titled Where Next?, in the wake of a string of catastrophic BBC fiascos including the Jimmy Savile crisis, the failed £100m Digital Media Initiative and the severance pay scandal. BBC insiders insisted the speech had . ‘something for everyone’, pointing to increased funding for the arts and . promises of more drama on BBC1. But critics accused Lord Hall of forgetting the BBC’s core and older audiences, many of whom do not access its services online. Tory MP Philip Davies, who sits on the culture media and sports select committee, said Hall’s global ambition, which will be borne by the BBC World Service and £245million from the licence fee next year, amounted to ‘strutting the world stage, empire-building on a global scale’ rather than focusing on the needs of British viewers. Meanwhile Tory MP Rob Wilson said: ‘Millions of the BBC’s traditional viewers will want reassurance the BBC isn’t going to neglect its traditional channels while its executives pursue trendy projects. Television got only a brief and grudging mention in the Director-General’s nearly 5,000 word speech.’ Lord Hall admitted funding would require some ‘hard choices’, and an extra £100million a year – on top of existing budget cuts of 20 per cent – would need to be found. The current licence fee of £145.50 has been frozen until 2017, so to increase its annual £3.7billion revenue the BBC plans to crack down on those who use a TV but avoid paying it. Lord Hall said: ‘We’ll make sure everyone who should be paying the licence fee is.’ Other parts of the BBC would have budgets slashed. ‘We’ll examine every penny we’re spending and redirect resources – money, people – towards our new priorities where we can,’ he said. Finally, Lord Hall promised to cut bureaucracy at the corporation by getting rid of ‘at least half of pan-BBC boards.’ Critics . warned the speech echoed the grandiose plans of previous director . generals and said the BBC has a history of failed IT projects. Pledge: BBC Director-General Tony Hall said he wants the corporation to cater for a 'new audience' of younger viewers and listeners . Lord Hall claimed the next decade would be a ‘bold era of BBC innovation’ and said he wanted to ‘harness the energy of the YouTube generation’. He said: ‘We are going to reinvent what we do, bit by bit, step by step, to serve this new audience.’ Defending Lord Hall’s plans to expand the BBC’s global reach, a spokesman said: ‘The BBC plays a major role in enhancing Britain’s standing and reputation overseas. ‘It has led the world as a trusted news provider for 80 years, especially through the World Service; we do not want to cede this position to new competitors like China or Russia.’","BBC Director-General Tony Hall wants to double global audience by 2022 .

"By . Mark Duell . Anti-rape campaigners today slammed adverts for a minicab firm featuring a vulnerable-looking woman caught in a downpour. The use of the image on 200,000 promotional postcards which say ‘Should have used Data Cars’ has attracted criticism - but the company insists it merely shows a woman caught out by the weather. Les Chapman, manager of Data Cars in Lewisham, south-east London, said his inspiration for the campaign came from seeing his teenage daughters coming home from a night out looking drenched. Controversial: The use of the image on 200,000 promotional postcards which say 'Should have used Data Cars' has attracted criticism - but the company insists it merely shows a woman caught out by the weather . Postcard: The firm's message signed off with the mock address: 'A. Muchbetter, 5 Ervice, Than, NE1 ELS' But Rape Crisis said the advertising was ‘a really unfortunate and misguided piece of advertising’. Katie Russell from the charity said: ‘The best case scenario, giving the company the benefit of the doubt, is that they're not aware of the associations that the image on this postcard conjures. ‘The worst case scenario is that they've knowingly used scare-mongering, sexist and victim-blaming imagery and messaging in a cynical marketing ploy.’ When the postcard was sent out it started a wave of outrage, with angry comments left on the Data Cars Twitter feed and complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority and Transport for London. Defence: Les Chapman, manager of Data Cars in Lewisham, south-east London, said his inspiration for the campaign came from seeing his teenage daughters coming home from a night out looking drenched . Complaint: One Twitter user said shadows on the girl's body resembled bruising and she looked in distress . However Mr Chapman said: ‘The way we viewed the image, it is simply a girl who has gone out on a hot summer evening and the predicable British weather has opened the heavens and she got soaking wet. 'The worst case scenario is that they've knowingly used scare-mongering, sexist and victim-blaming imagery and messaging in a cynical marketing ploy' Katie Russell, Rape Crisis . ‘This is something we see every year and this year we decided to place an advertising campaign with this in mind.’ He said the wording on the back of the postcard makes it clear, saying: ‘You should look just as great coming home as you did going out, so don't gamble on the weather... get a Data Cars minicab.’ But one commenter on Twitter said shadows on the girl's body resembled bruising and she looked in some distress, likening it to adverts for Transport for London’s minicab safety campaign Cabwise. Headquarters: Data Cars is based at the Handicars of London office in Lewisham, south-east London . Dee Elms said: ‘Check the bruises on her arms. That's what bothered me. 'Use our cabs - or u gonna get RAPED!’ 'It is simply a girl who has gone out on a hot summer evening and the predicable British weather has opened the heavens and she got soaking wet' Lee Chapman, Data Cars . However Mr Chapman added: ‘I think in life people see everything in different ways. Most people who have looked at it, I'd say 99.5 per cent, have seen it exactly for what it is. ‘The comments can be frustrating as we promote safety more than any other minicab company in South East London and would obviously apologise if we have offending anyone.’ He said: ‘Data Cars have always been at the forefront with safety ideas and were the first local company to introduce drivers' ID badges way back in the 1990s as well as the first to text the vehicle details of the customer nearly 10 years ago.’","The 200,000 promotional postcards say 'Should have used Data Cars'

"By . Craig Hope . Follow @@CraigHope01 . Leeds United are preparing to enter into the new season with morale at rock bottom. The club’s players returned to their Thorp Arch training ground last week only to be shocked by the cost-saving measures brought in by new owner Massimo Cellino. The kitchen which used to lay on breakfast and a hot lunch for the squad after training is now closed and youth-team players have been sent out to bring in sandwiches. Ringing the changes: Massimo Celino with former Leeds United manager Brian McDermott, who left in May . The laundry service which provides the players with their daily training kit is also gone. And a training-ground source told Sportsmail: ‘It’s ridiculous. It’s all the players can talk about. ‘There is no hot food for the lads and the younger boys have been going out to get sandwiches. ‘The players wouldn’t mind even if they had to pay a few quid for some hot food after training and in the morning but there is nothing at all. ‘Then there is the laundry situation – there aren’t even any underpants for the lads to train in. ‘The message from the club seems to be “like it or lump it” and it’s fair to say that morale in the squad is pretty low right now.’ It all made for a troubled atmosphere in which new head coach Dave Hockaday met his players for the first time. But the ex-Forest Green Rovers boss – a surprise appointment two weeks ago – is fully signed up to Cellino’s austerity measures. On his way: Star striker Ross McCormack is on the verge of a move to Fulham . The 56-year-old said: ‘We are going to have to get rid of all the excess baggage. There’s too much excess baggage at Leeds in every department. ‘We need to pare things back, get it right back to the bones and start fleshing it out as we want. ‘It will be ongoing and from a business point of view, that’s Mr Cellino’s business. ‘It’s just too much, we are haemorrhaging in every department. I am sure there will be people unfortunately going out and that’s life, not just football, on and off the pitch.’ It is all a far cry from the excesses of the Peter Ridsdale regime of the early 2000s which saw Leeds reach the semi-finals of the Champions League and break the British transfer record when they paid £18m for Rio Ferdinand from West Ham in 2000. They were eventually relegated in 2004 and have remained outside of the top flight for a decade, dropping into the third tier for three seasons between 2007 and 2010. Their current transfer embargo is expected to be lifted and Cellino’s Italian connection has seen a number of players from Serie B linked with a move to Elland Road. New head coach: Dave Hockaday joined the club two weeks ago . Star striker Ross McCormack is on the verge of a move to Fulham, although their £7m valuation is short of the £10m Cellino is demanding. Goalkeeper Paddy Kenny – who reported back for training looking decidedly out of shape – is also on his way out of the club. Our source added: ‘It’s probably going to get worse before it ever gets better. ‘The players are expecting more to leave and they’re not sure about a lot of the foreign names which have been mentioned with regards coming in. ‘The lads were also surprised about the new coach and most of them had never heard of him.’ A squad of 20 players are currently at a training camp in Santa Cristina in northern Italy. They kick off their Championship campaign with a trip to Millwall on August 9 but bookmakers price them at just 7/2 to be relegated come the end of the season.

"By . Darren Boyle . Christians claim they have been banned from holding a bible talk in a pub named after the founder of Sunday Schools - because it might offend other religions. Churchgoers had organised their annual Bible Day event at Robert Raikes House, an inn named after the man behind the Sunday school movement in the 18th Century. But they have now been forced to find a new venue claiming the landlord did not want to be associated with the word 'bible'. A group of devoted Christians, pictured, claim they are being discriminated against because they cannot hold a talk on the founder of the Sunday School movement in his former house which is now a pub . The home of Robert Raikes, founder of the Sunday School movement has been converted into a pub, pictured . Roland Parsons, city preacher and . spokesman for the group, said: 'We think the pub has excluded us because . it wanted to please everybody else and not have the word Bible . associated with the establishment. 'We find this quite ironic because of the work Robert Raikes did for Christianity and education. 'It’s upsetting to be banned but, as a Christian, I personally forgive the manager.' The event, which is due to be held tomorrow, will be discussing Robert Raikes, so decided it would be fitting to hold it at the pub. But Phil Tandy, manager of the pub in Gloucester, claims he told the group to find an alternative venue to host the event as he was not prepared for large numbers. Mr Tandy also said he did not think that pubs and religious activity mixed. He added that the reason he had blocked the group from hosting the annual event was due to the fact they had not communicated with the team properly. He said: 'I’ve got absolutely no problem at all with the word Bible but we were not consulted about being associated with Bible Day. 'Then I see flyers across town associating us with the event without being told. 'The group also couldn’t guarantee how many people who be attending the meal. If they had 100 people coming that would disrupt the pub for the public. 'I know Robert Raikes was a famous religious figure in Gloucester, but, personally, I’m not sure a pub should be associated with religious activities.' The Reverend Gwyenth Gibbens, from Holy Trinity Church, Longlevens, said it’s important churches are allowed freedom. He said: 'It’s important the church has the freedom to express itself and not become a fringe group. Christians and the church are part of the history of this country.' Robert Raikes, pictured, was a liberal campaigner who used his Gloucester Journal newspaper to promote his views on prison reform, the need to educate the working class and his fledgling Sunday School society .","Robert Raikes founded the first Sunday School in Gloucester in 1780 .

United Kingdom (2.3) South Korea’s unparalleled liquor consumption is almost entirely down to the country’s love for the fermented rice spirit Soju. The South Korean liquor accounts for 97 per cent of the country’s spirits market, according to Quartz. Hard drinking has become a growing issue in South Korea forcing the government to launch a marketing campaign to reign in its citizens' boozing. 'Almost every night in almost every police station lockup in Seoul, . drunken men - and sometimes women - can be found abusing officers . verbally and even physically, as a widely tolerated way of banishing . anger,' reported the New York Times in 2012. 'They usually are allowed to sleep it off and go home, their . punishment no more than a small fine.' 'A problem with the way South Koreans drink is that they drink fast to get drunk fast,' an official at the Korean Alcohol Research Foundation told the paper. Many South Koreans, who work some of the . longest hours in the world, believe that one of the quickest ways of . building friendship and office camaraderie is to get drunk together, the . Times' report added. There, 'he who drinks more works better' is a common saying, and the working person’s drink of choice is often . “the bomb,” a shot glass of soju added to a glass of beer. The concoction is then downed in unison by all around the table to shouts of “One shot!” or “Bottoms up!” Down and out: Of 44 countries studied by Euromonitor, The Russians were the second hardest drinkers at 6.3 shots per week.

However, while the South Koreans are the heaviest drinkers when it comes to hard liquor, they are 13th heaviest drinkers overall, according to the World Health Organisation. A .

"By . Harriet Cooke . Addictive: Text messages took the world by storm in 1998, but less than two decades later it is in decline as new forms of messaging have become more popular . A revolutionary form of communication is in decline - just 20 years after it changed the way that people interact with each other. Used by four billion people around the world, the SMS (Short Message Service) took the world by storm after its birth in December 1992. But after two decades of fervently bashing keypads with our thumbs, media watchdog Ofcom has reported a decline in the volume of texts sent. The number of text messages sent in Britain peaked at 39.7billion at the end of last year, but is now down to 38.5billion, following two quarterly declines. The fall has been attributed to new forms of communication which have taken over from the basic SMS system. Owners of modern smartphones now have a plethora of ways of communicating with each other - including Tweeting and instant messaging. The first ever text - sent in December 1992 - simply read 'Merry Christmas', after being sent by engineer Neil Papworth from his personal . computer to Vodafone's Richard Jarvis. This humble beginning kicked off a cultural and social revolution in the developed world, and texts have been used to seal business deals and even convey marriage proposals. Advanced: Many mobile phones now use the internet and their owners have more choice in how to communicate with friends and contacts, including Twitter and instant messaging . The trend of texting exploded among children in 1998 with the introduction of the 'pay as you go' system by four major phone companies. But it was only in 1999 that texting became a way of life when users could start sending text messages to people using different mobile networks to their own. Texts soon completely transformed the way we write by introducing new abbreviations to the English language now known as 'text speak'. Today is the 20th anniversary of the first ever text message. It was sent by 22-year-old engineer . Neil Papworth, pictured right, on December 3, 1992, whom was sitting at a computer . terminal in Vodafone's Newbury HQ where his colleague were enjoying . their Christmas party. He had to type the text on a computer . before sending it because mobile phones did not keyboards - these were . not developed until 1997. His text to the company's technical director Richard Jarvis' Orbitel 901 mobile phone simply read 'Merry Christmas'. Originally intended as a pager for contacting people on the road, the first text message spawned a revolution in communication. But it was not until 1999 that messages could be sent and received between different networks. Although a first, the concept of text messages  had been developed eight years earlier by the Franco-German GSM corporation. Since the Mr Papworth's pioneering text, SMS - or short message service - has taken over the world. It has been used to organise . revolutions during the Arab Spring and to coordinate relief efforts and . raise money for survivors of natural disasters such as the Boxing Day . Tsunami and the Haiti earthquakes. With 150 billion text messages sent . last year in the UK - almost triple the number sent in 2006 - texting . became the most common form of communication. It is called short message service . because in English a text can only have 140 characters. In other . alphabets, such as Chinese, texts can only have 70 characters. The average 12 to 15-year-old send 193 texts a week and politicians have blamed the . abbreviated language on the demise of literacy among the youth as . punctuation, grammar and capitalisation are largely ignored in favour of . brevity. Text messages sent around the world now generates £73.5billion a year with the average Brit sending 50 texts a week. It gave rise to a number of new challenges for modern society, including bullying, the dangers of texting while driving and 'sexting' - where sexually explicit photographs or messages are sent by mobile phone. As well as giving bullies an easy way to torment their victims out of school, the trend of sexting among teens has also caused concern. A 2008 survey by The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy found one in five teen girls surveyed admitted to electronically sending nude or semi-nude images of themselves. One-third of teen boys and one-quarter of teen girls say they were shown private nude or semi-nude images. According to the survey, sexually suggestive messages sent by text, e-mail, and instant messaging were even more common than images. Nearly 40 per cent of teens admitted to having sent or posted such messages, and half of teens have received them. More recently, a 2012 study by the University of Utah Department of Psychology found nearly 20 percent of the students said they had sent a sexually explicit image of themselves on their mobile. James Thickett, Ofcom's director of . research, told The Independent: 'For the first time in the history of . mobile phones, SMS volumes are showing signs of decline. 'The . availability of a wider range of communications tools, like instant . messaging and social networking sites, means people might be sending . fewer SMS messages, but they are communicating electronically more than . ever before.' While texting . might be on decline in favour of alternative - and often cheaper - . forms of electronic communication, experts warn that it is our personal . relationships that are really at risk. Ironically, a new study has found . that while electronic communication has made it easier than ever for . people to stay in touch, it has actually started to erode out ability to communicate with others. The communication revolution: The average Brit sends 50 texts a week while average teenagers send 193 texts a week . Here are just a selection of the most common words that have infiltrated not just the way we write but also the way we speak: . LOL - Laugh out loud                      TBH - To be honest                                               B4N - Bye for nowOMG - Oh my God                           ROTFL - Rolling on the floor laughing         ASL - Age, sex, location BFF - Best friends forever            ASAP - As soon as possible                      CU - See you      LMAO - Laugh my a** off           FoMo - Fear of missing out                            AML - All my love    Thx - Thanks                             YoLo - You only live once                                  Srsly - seriously           Swak - Sealed with a kiss              WTH - What the hell                                  RU - Are you    Gr8 - Great                                          TTFN - Ta ta for now                                             M8 -Mate Atm - At the moment                        FYI - For your information                        B4 - Before POV - point of view                            AFC - away from keyboard                              L8r - Later     TTYL - talk to you later               BBL - Be back later                                  XOXO - Hugs and kisses . And it revealed that texting has become as addictive as compulsive spending for many. Study author Dr James Roberts said: 'Mobile phones are a part of our consumer culture. 'They are not just a consumer tool, but are used as a status symbol. They're also eroding our personal relationships.' Previous studies have revealed young adults send on average 109.5 texts a day, or approximately 3,200 messages a month. They receive an additional 113 texts . and check their phones 60 times in a typical day and students spend . about seven hours a day interacting with information and communication . technology. Dr Roberts added: 'At first glance, . one might have the tendency to dismiss such aberrant mobile phone use as . merely youthful nonsense - a passing fad. 'But an emerging body of literature has given increasing credence to cell phone addiction and similar behavioural addictions.' New trends: But experts fear that the increased use of electronic communication is causing people to lose the ability to communicate with others in person .","Number of texts sent annually has fallen by one billion since last year .

"By . Becky Evans . Parking wardens could be dishing out higher fines after Transport Secretary Norman Baker said the current price may not be enough of a 'deterrent' Parking fines could rise by as much as £50 because the current cap on charges may not act as enough as a 'deterrent' for drivers. Currently, motorists outside London pay a maximum of £70 for a parking fine but Transport Secretary Norman Baker said this is under review. It means drivers could be forced to pay as much as £130 for a parking ticket - if the London charge cap is introduced around the country. Mr Baker confirmed to MPs at the transport select committee meeting yesterday that a review on fines is underway - the first on charges outside of London since 2001. He said Londoners have faced escalating fines after both Ken Livingstone and Boris Johnston increased the cap. However, fines outside the capital have remained static. The Lewes MP said: 'It can be argued that if the cost of legitimate parking rises to such a degree that the penalty no longer becomes a deterrent then that should be looked at', he was quoted in The Telegraph as saying. The review has been criticised by motorist groups. Edmund King, President of the AA, told The Telegraph: 'Our concern would be that local authorities become reliant on the fines as income'. He added there was a danger local authorities use parking fines as a source of revenue rather than a measure to prevent illegal parking. Mr Baker admitted that any rise would prove unpopular with drivers, who are already being squeezed at the pumps. Londoners have faced rising fines -  currently capped at £130 - but charges elsewhere have remained static . Mr Baker admitted increasing the fines may 'send out the wrong message' He told MPs that rises may hit struggling town centres hard and 'send out the wrong message' to motorists. However, Mr Baker refused to tell the committee what decision he is likely to make. The British Parking Association supports councils who want to increase penalty charges. The association said in its 2013 parking masterplan that it wants fines to be reviewed at least every four years. It says on its website more frequent reviews are needed 'to ensure they remain effective and fit for purpose and that charges are set locally'. The association said: 'There is an urgent need to change these penalty charges since they often fail to act as a deter rent and sometimes encourage non-compliance with traffic management and parking rules. 'This is costly and unfair on council tax payers who will be subsidising parking enforcement and undermines effectiveness of local transport policies.'","Transport secretary Norman Baker opened review into parking fine cap .

Murray White, the National Farmers' Union branch secretary for Inverness, Nairn and Moray, said: 'It's going to take some farmers several days to clear the sand away. 'We might have lost 10 per cent of the harvest, and then again we might have lost 50 per cent. It's too early to say at the moment.

If the mercury rises as high as predicted, it will be as hot as the city of Tangiers in Morocco – and warmer than California, where it is expected to reach just 19C (66f). But the country will have a north-south split. While southerners enjoy relatively balmy conditions, those in northern England and Scotland will see temperatures dipping to zero at night. And the chillier weather is expected to spread south by the weekend, bringing clouds and rain to most places. Forecaster Charlie Powell said: ‘As we move into the middle of this week we could see one of the warmest days of the year so far, but only in a few places. ‘We will have a weather system that essentially cuts the UK in  half. Temperatures in the upper half – northern England and  Scotland – will be around 9-11C (48-52f), which isn’t too far off normal for the time of year. ‘But in the southern half of the UK we are likely to see fairly dry, fine weather, sunshine and temperatures that could reach 21C (70f).’ Low visibility: Sandstorms swept across Moray covering roads and fields . Dangerous: Driving conditions on the A96 near Elgin in Moray were poor yesterday as gales sent clouds of sand racing across the land . Hazy: The sandstorms came less than a week after a first storm was cleared up by the council . However, he warned the good weather . would not last, adding: ‘By the time we get to Friday that band will . have pushed its way to the south of the country. Most of the country can . expect a cool and showery end to the week. ‘We can expect highs of 11C (52f), . which is average for April. And on Saturday and Sunday we’ll have a band . of rain from the north-west arriving in the south-east.' The warmest day of the year so far was April 14, when 22C (72f) was recorded in Kent. But these glimpses of good weather . are little comfort to businesses struggling to deal with one of the . coldest springs in decades. In Lincolnshire, organisers of the . Spalding Flower Parade are being forced to import hundreds of thousands . of tulips from France because of a shortage of British blooms caused by . cold weather. Manager Kathleen Codd said there was ‘very little likelihood’ of getting enough homegrown flowers before the event on May 4. Hayfever . sufferers will feel the effects of the highest pollen levels for half a . century, but the rest of us should enjoy a balmy few days - in which . southern England will enjoy warmer weather than Hollywood (where it's . currently around 19C) before it starts to feel unseasonably cold again. Hay fever expert Professor Roy . Kennedy said the cold March and start to April means the period until . June will see its highest pollen levels since 1962. Peak pollen levels normally occur later in summer, but the bitter March delayed the start of . the pollen season by a month, with tree pollen now soaring and the . expected 'phenomenon of tree pollen colliding with grass pollen' from . mid-May. Blossoming: Gun salutes in honour of the Queen's birthday were postponed until today as her actual birthday, which is on April 21st, fell on a Sunday . Flowers of spring: The King's Troop Royal Artillery arriving in Green Park for the 41 gun salute in honour of the Queen's 87th birthday . Meanwhile the extended wintry conditions mean that spring is blooming late, quite literally. Last . year Britain’s gardens, . parks and woodlands were awash with a stunning riot of colour, but this . spring has yet to bloom after a bitter March followed hard on the heels . of a cold winter. With . spring delayed by over a month and no real signs of seasonal flowers . such as tulips or bluebells, many will be wondering if Britain will ever . burst into bloom. But garden writer Nigel Colborn, a . former Royal Horticultural Society vice-chairman, says that with the . arrival of warmer weather, we are likely to have a much shorter but more . intense spring awakening. Forecasters . are predicting temperatures will remain higher than the seasonal . average for the rest of the week – a boon for gardeners. Mr Colburn said: ‘Plants, particularly spring varieties, have a self-survival kit. 'They . won’t grow until the temperature is above 4C (39F) degrees for a period . of time. Once warm weather sticks around they’ll kick into rapid . growth. 'Because of the bitterly cold March, we are running about a month late compared to a normal season: Instead of it being a drawn-out . spring, we are going to have an explosion of colour, but over a shorter . period.We will soon be treated to a fantastically colourful bounty.’ After a pleasant, sunny weekend for much . of the country, the Met Office says temperatures will remain slightly . warmer than the seasonal average this week – reaching 20C (68F) by . Thursday in the south east. In bloom: A sea of daffodils set the scene for the Queen's birthday celebrations . 'Mixed bag': Met Office forecasters are predicting a week of changeable weather . But it is still too soon to pack away your winter woollens. At the weekend temperatures are due to plummet to a chilly 6C (43F). May is almost upon us, but there were . still patches of frost in parts of the UK overnight between Saturday and Sunday, with a low of . -2.7C in Charlwood, Surrey. While there will be some sunny spells . across the UK in the coming week, Britons are advised to keep their . umbrellas and jackets close to hand along with their sunglasses. Mr Lawrence described bands of rain moving in from the Atlantic, bringing wind and showers to the UK. 'This week on the whole is on the unsettled side and quite changeable. 'We've got bands of rain moving in from the Atlantic, although it won't be a wash out.' 'A fair bit of cloud' is also . expected throughout the week, he said, with conditions likely to change . from sunny to grey even 'within each day'. 'Temperatures in the south might . manage 20C in the South East later in the week, perhaps by Thursday,' said the forecaster, who added that current temperatures were fairly . typical for the time of year. 'So it will be warm at times in the south. Broadly speaking we've got a north-south split, with the north wetter and windier, but still with some sunshine. In the south it will be less wet and windy.' While temperatures dropped to 2.7C in Surrey overnight, Lossiemouth in Scotland recorded a low of 7.6C, in a 'flip' of the typical pattern of warmer conditions in the south.","Scotland battered again by second round of sandstorms devastating crops .

"By . Daniel Mills for Daily Mail Australia . A Sydney fisherman has filmed himself in a titanic battle with a human-sized yellowfin tuna he landed in stormy weather  off the coast of Sydney. Battling torrential rain and two-metre swells, experienced angler Josh Stuckey caught the 76kg fish after it latched onto a rod specially rigged-up for the one-man fishing expedition 40km off Sydney's coastline. After initially planning to 'call it a day' after an uneventful Saturday morning on the water, Mr Stuckey headed for home before his prized-catch, a caught hold. Scroll down for video . Josh Stuckey was fishing 50km off the coast of Sydney when the Tuna took hold . The experienced angler battled the tuna for more than an hour in rough seas . Navigating  through 'torrential rain' in his 4.5 metre runabout, Mr Stuckey filmed himself reeling the fish in with a GoPro camera mounted to the front of the boat at Browns Mountain - a section of sea popular with game fisherman. The daring angler wrote in a fishing blog he was 'about to call it a day' when a mate called him over to a spot where he was having more luck. En-route to the new location, Mr Stuckey suddenly leapt to his feet when he heard the line to one of his eight rods start spinning ferociously. He wrote how he had 'happily been chugging along, through a couple of torrential downpours' before his luck turned. Preparing for what would eventually be a one-hour wrestle, Mr Stuckey de-rigged the remaining tackle on board to give him more room to manoeuvre around the boat. He filmed the whole ordeal on camera which showed just how much of a fight the tuna gave him before he finally brought it to the side of the boat. After bringing it to the boat he battled to haul it aboard and used various solo fishing techniques . Mr Stuckey was holding on to a large hook attached to the tuna's mouth when he brought it in . 'Just as stuffed as the fish:' He used every once of strength to haul it on deck . It was at this point he  declared in the Fishing World blog that he was 'just as stuffed as the fish' and admitted that he almost lost it when he took a rest. 'The fish was stuffed and didn't do a great deal and so I tried to skulldrag the fish up and over the gunwale,' he wrote. 'Just as stuffed as the fish' Mr Stuckey admitted he almost lost the prized-catch when he sat back down and dropped it overboard, because he didn't 'quite have the huff 'n' puff left in me to go the extra yards.' 'I got the head and shoulders up and over the height of the gunwale but I was just as stuffed as the fish and didn't quite have the huff 'n' puff left in me to go the extra yards.' 'Reluctantly I dropped the tuna back to the water back to the water and made a couple more attempts without success,' he wrote.' The whole episode was filmed with a GoPro mounted to the front of the boat . He said he  waited for a decent swell to come up which helped him heave it on board . Mr Stuckey's boat was specially rigged for the game fishing expedition . When he finally secured it with some rope and a ski hook, his only move was to then reef it over the side without managing to hook himself in the had. 'I took a moment to catch my breath, dropped the tail rope off the ski hook and drew the fish's head up to the gunwale.' 'I just waited for a decent swell to come up and heaved on the fish, getting him half up and over the gunwale and reefed back and the fish came spearing into the boat.' 'He said I was pumped,' before sitting on the boat's floor to reflect on his monster catch. 'I sat there on the floor for a moment before moving the fish around and getting some GoPro footage holding the fish up. 'This is the downside of fishing solo, no one to get good quality pics while the fish is still lit up and looking its best,' he wrote. On his way home he took the fish to be weighed at a station near Watsons Bay, in Sydney's east, where it was gutted, and shared between two of his friends.","Josh Stuckey caught the fish unaided during a sea trip outside Sydney .

It was the first assault on a diplomatic mission in Tripoli, considered safer than the rest of the North African country, since the end of the 2011 war that ousted Muammar Gaddafi, leaving Libya awash with weapons and roaming armed groups. There have been several attacks on diplomatic missions, notably in the eastern city of Benghazi, where the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans were killed last September.

Harrison Ford may have to be filmed from the waist up after breaking his ankle on the set of  Star Wars: Episode VII. The 71-year-old suffered the break last Thursday after one of the hydraulic doors of the spacecraft Millennium Falcon fell on him and he had to be airlifted to the trauma unit at John .

"By . Associated Press . and Mail Online Reporter . If you think fall weddings are inconvenient for college football fans, imagine being a coach with a daughter who has her heart set on a Saturday in late September. That was Wagner College coach Walt Hameline's dilemma, when his youngest daughter, Kelly, told him last fall the place she chose as the site of her big day had few dates available — and the one she picked was September 20, the same day Wagner was scheduled to play Monmouth University. 'How can you do this?' Hameline said was his reaction. Family affair: Wagner football coach Walt Hameline, second from left, poses with his family, from left, daughter Kristen, wife Debi and daugher Kelly at a college football game against Monmouth in Staten Island New York . 'What are you thinking about? It's football season. Ever since she was a baby she went to every football game.' With the help of an old friend, Hameline was able to reschedule the game. Wagner, an FCS school in Staten Island, visits its old Northeast Conference rival on the Jersey Shore on Saturday, giving the Seahawks an open date on Sept. 20 and keeping peace in the Hameline family. 'It's her wedding present and a lot of presents to follow throughout life,' Hameline in a phone interview Friday. Hameline is in his 34th season as head coach at Wagner. He has a career record of 217-136-2, fifth among active FCS coaches in career victories, and is also the school's athletic director. Sometimes it pays to be your own boss. Kelly Hameline, 28, let her father know that she had found the perfect place to have her wedding — 'The most expensive place you can find,' Walt Hameline said — on Long Beach Island, New Jersey. Turns out, the bill was only Hameline's second-biggest problem. 'There was only like, one or two dates (available),' he said. Still, Hameline could hardly believe what his daughter was asking. 'There's always been a golden rule in our family,' he said. ""Once football season starts, my wife, my family, they go to the games and we do nothing else."" Not this time. Rescheduled: Luckily the bride-to-be got her wish after Hameline was able to reschedule the game . After last season was over, Hameline reached out to Monmouth coach Kevin Callahan. The two had crossed paths and become friends as young assistant coaches in the late 1970s, and when Hameline became head coach at Wagner, Callahan was the first coach he hired. 'It was kind of funny,' Callahan said, recalling the conversation with a laugh. 'In typical Walt fashion he goes, 'Hey, hey, hey, you gotta help me out.' My first thought was, what's he up to here? Let me figure this out.' Callahan was in the process of filling Sept. 20 on Monmouth's schedule, but was able to move the Wagner game, lock it in and build the team's remaining schedule around it. 'We had the flexibility to make it work. I was more than happy to do it,' said Callahan, who has been coach at Monmouth for 22 years. So while Callahan won't be attending the wedding — the Hawks play at Duquesne that day — he's covered for a gift. And Kelly Hameline, who lives in the Chicago area, will be at the Wagner-Monmouth game Saturday. As for Hameline, he's just happy his daughter's wedding didn't conflict with Wagner's game last week at Florida International, an FBS school. He said Wagner was paid $240,000 for that trip to South Florida. 'Let's get this straight,' Hameline said, 'I wasn't calling FIU up.'

Sneak a radio into the service to keep up with the action, or behave with dignity and enjoy the couple's big day? Were you invited to this Kenyan couple's wedding, however, one suspects you would not have to make the tricky decision. The bride and groom decided to theme their wedding around Manchester United, with everything from their clothes to the wedding cake featuring Red Devils branding. VIDEO Scroll down for WATCH Manchester United unveil their new kit . The happy couple: Can you guess which Premier League club this groom supports? That's the spirit: The bride wore a traditional white dress but showed he support with a red flower in her hair . As revealed by Africa Gossip News, the groom wore a United replica kit for the nuptials, and while his bride looks rather unamused at his choice in one wedding photo, a quick glance an another photo reveals the couple are United in their support. While the bride is wearing a traditional white dress, she can also be seen with a red flower in her hair and so sports the club's colours. Just for good measure the groom has 'just married' printed on the back of his kit. Sponsors will be pleased: The Kenya couple had their cake decorated with red icing and a Chevrolet logo . The cake is decorated with red icing plus several Chevrolet logos in a nod to the club's home kit for the 2013-14 season. The wedding car appears to be one part of the wedding that escapes the United treatment, but a closer look at the silver Mercedes shows that it is also decorated with red and white flowers. There is also a large United flag draped over the rear window. Let's hope the marriage is a match made in heaven, like when Sir Alex Ferguson joined the club, and does not end in a quick divorce, such as when David Moyes took over last season.

"By . Jack Doyle . New rights to flexible working will ‘make workers happier’ and improve their productivity, a minister has claimed. From today, all 30million workers in Britain will get the right to ask for flexible hours – instead of just parents and carers. Liberal Democrat business minister Jo Swinson said it was a ‘1950’s mindset’ which said workers actually needed to be in the office to get their work done. From today, all 30million workers in Britain will get the right to ask for flexible hours - instead of just parents and carers . But employment lawyers predicted a huge surge in the number of workplace grievances and rising ‘resentment’ between workers who get what they want and those who lose out. And business groups reminded employees that the ‘work still needs to be done’. The new right is expected to lead to a huge shift in employment practices in firms where flexible working is not yet allowed. It allows workers to demand part time hours, compressed hours, working from home or job sharing. Miss Swinson, who has just returned from maternity leave said: ‘Sometimes, because this has been a right to request that only parents have had, that can create, in some workplaces, a bit of tension when parents get special treatment.’ She said workers could benefit with compressed hours, commuting outside rush hour and or working from home. ‘Employers often find that this leads to employees being much more motivated, productive, less likely to leave. So that cuts down their staff recruitment costs. It really can be a win-win’, she told the Independent on Sunday. ‘You get staff that are happy and more productive and the employers benefit from that as well. And lots of businesses are very positive about this. ‘We live in a globalised society, we have technology which enables us to be doing work not just from physically being there at the workplace but actually doing so at different times of the day and from different places. ‘And rather than it staying stuck in a 1950s mind-set that being at work is about physically being somewhere and it’s about long hours and that ‘presenteeism’ culture, actually it’s about achieving what you’re supposed to do in your job and doing that in the most effective way. Liberal Democrat business minister Jo Swinson said it was a '1950's mindset' which said workers actually needed to be in the office to get their work done . ‘So flexibility isn’t a special case; flexibility is just the way that organisations work and they recognise that they can benefit from that.’ But employment lawyers said the new rules could lead to a raft of new complaints from those who lose out. Fraser Younson, an employment law specialist and partner at the law firm Squire Patton Boggs, said: ‘We’ve already started to see an increase in the number of grievances filed by people who feel they are having to make up the work of colleagues working flexibly because they have children. ‘With everyone able to request flexible working, the number of grievances is only set to rise.’ A survey by the firm found 84pc of employers expect the new right to cause resentment among staff. More than half predict the change will adversely affect the day-to-day running of businesses. Companies have the right to refuse a request for flexible working if there is a valid business reason, such as the changes creating extra costs. There are also concerns about how the new rules will work – as requests will be considered in the order they are received and not on merit. The new right is expected to lead to a huge shift in employment practices in firms where flexible working is not yet allowed. It allows workers to demand part time hours, compressed hours, working from home or job sharing . As a result, someone wanting time off for a lie in or a hobby could win out simply if they get their request in first. Employers have been told they cannot judge applications on merit and should ‘pull the names out of a hat’ if two people ask for the same thing and both cannot be accommodated. Mr Younson added: ‘It says all requests should be considered equally but what if one request is from a parent and one is from an athlete who wants to train every day?’. Experts have also warned some workers may come to see the rules as a ‘right to have’ instead of a right to ask. Under the existing rules, around three out of five requests are granted and a further one in four after negotiation with employers. Neil Carberry, the CBI director for employment and skills, welcomed the new rules but added: ‘It’s important to remember that the work still needs to be done, so businesses will have to manage conflicting requests effectively and they retain the right to say no where the company just can’t make it work.’","30million workers in Britain will get the right to ask for flexible hours .

Next up is the club’s captain Mikel Arteta. ‘I can’t change that my hair is perfecto,’ the Spaniard says while using hairspray to keep his locks in place. Santi Cazorla – one of the Premier League’s smallest players at just 5ft 6in – then appears, albeit comically with only half of his face on display. ‘I can’t change my height,’ he says during the 30-second advert. ‘I can’t change that I look like a Teenage Ninja Mutant Hero’, adds Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain before crocked Giroud probably provokes the biggest laugh.
