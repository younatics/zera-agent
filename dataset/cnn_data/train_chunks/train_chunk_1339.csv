"The chain of events which sparked an auction for Rangers can be traced back to a conference call two weeks before Christmas. Norman Crighton, a former non-executive director of Rangers, took his leave of Ibrox on a Wednesday morning. His departure not only removed the first point of contact for Robert Sarver, the American who has upped his bid for the club to £20million plus £6.5m in short-term loans. It also ended the uneasy alliance safeguarding Mike Ashley’s powerbase. An undemonstrative financier, Crighton was never, as people had speculated, the appointed representative of Laxey Partners on the plc board. (l-r) James Easdale, David Somers, Barry Leach (back row), Derek Llambias and Sandy Easdale . Colin Kingsnorth, chairman of Laxey, put his name forward to the club’s former nominated advisers Daniel Stewart. But the final approval for his appointment was granted by chairman David Somers, James Easdale and former finance director Brian Stockbridge. A quietly spoken Dundonian with a strong ethical streak and extensive experience of publicly quoted companies, Crighton took his boardroom responsibilities at Rangers seriously. Guarding the interests of Laxey was never his goal. Protecting the wider body of shareholders was. While others, including the Easdale brothers and Somers, threw their weight behind Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley’s takeover by stealth, Crighton remained a sceptic. He stood back from the crowd and applied a critical eye. Norman Crighton's departure ended uneasy alliance safeguarding Mike Ashley’s powerbase . He began to ask questions. Plenty of them. Few were of the type his fellow directors cared to answer. In the weeks before his departure, Crighton sent a steady stream of emails querying the club’s running to Somers. All went unanswered. His queries were wide-ranging and complex. One was shared by many supporters. Why was Ashley obtaining so much power and influence. He had provided £3m of short-term loans. But the offer of £16m for a 51 per cent stake from Dave King and George Letham appeared to be better for shareholders. The issue was one of timing. The Ashley cash was available more quickly than the King cash and the board had failed to receive proof of funds from the South Africa-based former director. Apparently ignoring the club’s broader interests, Ashley pushed on at some pace. He pursued SFA dispensation to up his stake in the club to 29.9 per cent. Dual interest regulations would frustrate him in the end. Yet, two weeks before the club’s annual general meeting or the SFA edict, he was acting as if the deed was done. Sports Direct were effectively calling the shots. This struck some investors, most notably Laxey, as unsatisfactory. Ashley, after all, had just 8.92 per cent of the shares. He was a significant shareholder but by no means a majority one. Mike Ashley called the shots despite owning just 8.92 per cent of the shares in Rangers . With Rangers running out of money, however, a wealthy benefactor was needed. He was also prepared to work with the existing directors, Somers and the Easdales, so long as they supported his goals. To the outside world, Ashley’s goal appeared to be to protect the lucrative Rangers merchandising contracts which poured millions into the coffers of Sports Direct. His trusted lieutenants Derek Llambias and Barry Leach were brought in and became influential. So much so that, weeks before his appointment as chief executive was confirmed to the stock market, Llambias was the man who instigated the dismissal of Crighton during a conference call which became heated following more awkward, unwanted questions. To an outsider, Crighton’s questions would have seemed logical — necessary even. They were concerns any shareholder or non-executive director with the broader interests of the club might ask. But the broader interests of Rangers were no longer what was at stake two weeks before Christmas. What mattered by then were the interests of Ashley and Sports Direct. So it was, then, that Crighton was informed down a telephone line that his fellow directors no longer wished to work with him. Rangers manager Ally McCoist quickly followed Crighton out of Ibrox . Sources say he had become a persistent, troublesome thorn in the side of Ashley’s unquestioning acolytes. They could have waited until the AGM two weeks later, when Crighton was up for re-election anyway, and allowed shareholders to decide. But tension was growing and, as the subsequent emails have revealed, some on the Rangers board would do whatever it took to keep hold of their blazers and ties. Crighton’s exit, when it was confirmed, was low-key. Quickly forgotten. Within 48 hours Ally McCoist, an Ibrox icon, had resigned. The departure of a non-executive director threatened to become a footnote. Yet what happened that day proved to be critical. It was the beginning of the end for the Ibrox status quo. By bulleting Crighton, the Rangers directors created a substantial problem for themselves. In time, it may even prove to be their downfall. Laxey Partners, chaired by Kingsnorth, had been broadly supportive of the Ashley and Easdale powerbase during key votes. But the Isle of Man hedge fund were becoming concerned by the direction the club was moving in. Ashley’s interests, they believed, no longer aligned with theirs or those of Rangers as a club. Crighton’s removal was the final straw. It convinced Kingsnorth to sell the firm’s 14.5 per cent stake in the club. They were sold to the ‘Three Bears’ of George Letham, Douglas Park and George Taylor with a final withering salvo. In a statement, Kingsnorth blamed Somers for the departure of Crighton and described the chairman — a much-derided figure these days — as a ‘wet fish’. Robert Sarver, the soccer-loving owner of the Phoenix Suns basketball team . Laxey were appalled by a staggering request from Somers for a rise in his £60,000-a-year non-executive chairman’s salary. This at a time when the club were running out of cash. Yet Laxey’s shares might easily have gone elsewhere — to the man whose belated bid to purchase the club has just been rejected. Whilst still on the board, Crighton had received an approach from Sarver, the soccer-loving owner of the Phoenix Suns basketball team. Keen to acquire control of a football club in the UK, the American banker was persuaded by former Ibrox defender David Robertson — a fellow resident of Arizona — to consider saving Rangers. Through mutual friends, he was put in touch with Crighton. Opting to make an £18m offer for new shares — raised to £20m plus a £6.5m short-term loan —Sarver took a different path. The Laxey shares went instead to Park, Letham and Taylor. And within days King — acting separately, but with a common interest — would also purchase a near 15 per cent stake in the club. Previously untouchable, Ashley had been blindsided. Soon Leach was appointed finance director. It is presumed it was done on the say-so of his Sports Direct boss, but that has never been confirmed. Either way, the best strategy for Ashley now may be to work with the potential new investors rather than against them. If — or, rather, when — regime change happens, the chances of Somers or the Easdales retaining their cherished positions on the Rangers board diminish greatly. Another reason why they, as power slips from their fingers, must wish a conference call in mid-December had taken a different course.","Norman Crighton was a thorn in the side of potential buyer Mike Ashley .
His low-key departure may prove the downfall of the Rangers directors ."
"Welcome to your new home on Mars. Exterior solar panels are powering the dome-shaped habitat you’re standing in. The high ceilings should make you feel comfortable, and there’s a 3D-printer to make new tools. 'It might seem far-fetched, but that’s a scenario that might not be too far in the future when the first mission to Mars goes ahead - and Nasa has been preparing for the trip with a new study in Hawaii.' Teams of scientists have been simulating Martian living conditions on Earth. The Hi-Seas project, funded by Nasa, sees crews live in a habitat in Hawaii.  The habitat has space for six people and amenities include bedrooms, a bathroom, workspaces and even a dining room (shown in diagram) The Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation, or Hi-Seas, is a Nasa sponsored project to see how a crew would cope with living on Mars. The second of three missions was completed recently and the third, lasting eight months, has just started. It involves crews of six living in a large dome in a remote region of Hawaii, Mauna Loa. Here the crew is confined to a dome 36ft (11 metres) wide, with a living area of about 1,000 square feet (93 square metres), according to science journalist Kate Greene, writing for Wired, who took part in the project. ‘The key to keeping everybody sane? A sense of airiness,’ she says. The Hi-Seas (Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation) mission's crews spend months 8,000 feet (2,440 metres) above sea level in a geodesic-dome habitat on the northern slope of the Mauna Loa volcano. The volcano is a barren landscape, an abandoned quarry with little vegetation that's as similar to Mars' landscape as planet Earth can get. The crew members live under Mars-like conditions. According to Hi-Seas 'communication latencies and blackouts, in close quarters, under strict water-use rules, etc' are part of the deal. The food study was designed to test food preparation strategies for long-term space exploration. Hi-Seas aims to address problems that may be encountered in future space missions by simulating exploration in areas of the world similar to space environments. The aim mission, funded by Nasa's Human Research Program, the University of Hawaii and Cornell University, is to learn about living sustainably on Mars. The third mission started on 15 October 2014 and will last for eight months, while the final mission lasting a year begins in August 2015. The Hi-Seas (Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation) mission's crews live 8,000 feet (2,440 metres) above sea level in a geodesic-dome habitat on the northern slope of the Mauna Loa volcano (shown) There are six pie-slice-shaped bedrooms for the crewmembers to live in, all adjacent to one another (shown in diagram). This floor is above the ground level and also has a bathroom and an open balcony to below, making the habitat seem big so the crew doesn't feel trapped . Each room has a bed, mattress and a stool. There is space under each bed for clothes to be stored. A 3D printer is also in the habitat to enable the crew to print new tools if they need to. On a future mission to Mars, items like a 3D printer will likely be invaluable as resupply missions will be scarce or non-existent . The crew must spend the entirety of their trip inside the dome. They are only allowed to venture outside when wearing appropriate spacesuits, just like future astronauts on Mars will have to do. Earlier this week science writer Kate Green, who took part in the simulated mission to the red planet, argued on Slate that the first mission to the red planet should be crewed by only women. Ms Greene and five other crewmembers - three men and three women in total - spent four months in the dome on Hawaii, only leaving the habitat in mock spacesuits. She says it was rare for a woman to burn more than 2,000 calories a day, whereas men regularly exceeded 3,000. Her conclusion is that sending women to Mars would be cheaper and more feasible than one with men. Another study from the University of New Hampshire reported yesterday, however, said that women were more susceptible to cosmic radiation than men, so it would be difficult to complete a Mars mission before they succumbed to radiation sickness. To prevent the crew getting claustrophobic while inside the habitat, the dome has a large ceiling and is tiered in two floors. Regular exercise keeps the crew fit, with routines such as P90X often used. And in the project, as would happen in real life on Mars, the delay that would be experienced by a crew on Mars was simulated by a 24-minute time delay to all communication back ‘home’. The rooms, meanwhile, are six ‘pie-slice-shaped staterooms’ with a mattress, desk and stool. And to make sure they had sufficient access to supplies, the crew was given a 3D printer to make things they may have forgotten. Power is supplied by solar power, while a hydrogen fuel cell provides back-up power in the case that levels run too low. Earlier this year Nasa awarded $1.2 million to the Hi-Seas programme to continue its working studying the human factors that may affect a future crew on Mars. The first two missions lasted four months, the next will take eight months and the last will take place over a year beginning in August 2015 . Throughout the studies, researchers evaluate how the crew copes in the habitat. It's hoped the research will prove invaluable in an eventual mission to the red planet, which is expected to take place in the 2030s. Pictured here is the kitchen of the Mars habitat. The crew were given access to the same sorts of supplies as would be expected on a future mission to Mars. Throughout the mission, researchers evaluated how the crewmembers cope with the conditions . The crew are not allowed to leave the dome for the duration of the project except for when they do spacewalks (shown). These must be conducted in spacesuits, albeit more primitive versions of the ones that will one day be used on Mars. Spacewalks usually take place with just two or three of the six crewmembers . Nasa's ultimate goal is to take humans to the red planet in the 2030s. In December of this year they will test the Orion module (seen in the centre of the image) for the first time, which will be used to take astronauts out of and back into Earth's atmosphere, as well as to the red planet .","Teams of scientists have been simulating Martian living conditions on Earth .

"Most Americans do not want President Obama to shut down the United State's terrorist detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, according to a poll released this afternoon. Americans continue to be wary of releasing prisoners with terrorist ties like the ones swapped last month for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl or moving them to prisons in the U.S. Two in three Americans told Gallup that they want president Obama to keep the 149 suspected terrorists being held at Gitmo under lock and key on foreign soil instead of shutting down the camp. The majority of Americans don't want the president to close the terrorist holding facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba . American have never wanted the president to close Guantanamo Bay, but the number against it has increased since the president promised to shut it down on the campaign trail . Closing Guantanamo Bay was one of the president's core campaign promises in the 2008 presidential election. On his first full day in office, Obama stated that 'Guantanamo will be closed no later than one year from now.' That never happened, in part, because the idea became politically unpopular and Congress clamped down on the president's authority to release and transfer detainees. Americans have never wanted president Obama to close the prison and move the most dangerous inmates to prisons on U.S. soil, but the number in favor of keeping it open has sharply increased since the president brought attention to it by promising to shut it down. In 2007 a simple majority, 51 percent, of Americans thought the U.S. should keep Guantanamo Bay open. By 2009 that number had jumped up to 65 percent, and since then, roughly 66 percent of Americans have said they don't want it to close. The majority of the president's own . political party doesn't think he should close Guantanamo Bay. The percentage of self-proclaimed Democrats who believe Obama should close Gitmo has decreased 53 percent to 41 percent since 2009. In . Gallup's latest poll, 54 percent of self-proclaimed Democrats said Obama . should not close the prison. Nevertheless, President Obama has pushed forward with his plan. Obama told Congress in his 2014 State of the Union address in January, 'With the Afghan war ending, this needs to be the year Congress lifts the remaining restrictions on detainee transfers and we close the prison at Guantanamo Bay – because we counter terrorism not just through intelligence and military action, but by remaining true to our Constitutional ideals, and setting an example for the rest of the world.' Current law prohibits the president from transferring terrorists to U.S. prisons. Additionally, the president is legally required to show that it is in the national interest of the country to release detainees and steps have been taken to 'substantially mitigate the risk of such individual engaging or reengaging in any terrorist or other hostile activity that threatens the United States' before they can be repatriated. He is also required to give Congress 30 days notice before releasing detainees. Obama did not confer with Congress in the case of Bergdahl exchange, but the Obama administration has said they did not break the law because it only applies to prisoner releases, not trades. This March 2013 picture shows the exterior of Camp Delta at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. The president has said he wants to shut down the U.S. detention facilities there, but he lacks the power to do so . Even members of the president's own party don't want him to shut down Gitmor . As a result of the stringent restrictions placed on the president, only 17 Guantanamo Bay prisoners have been released in the last 13 months. That number includes the five Taliban fighters Obama traded last month. One way the president may legally be able to release the terrorists being held at Guantanamo Bay is by ending the war in Afghanistan. Legal scholars have argued that the U.S. is only authorized to keep the captured Taliban associates in prison as long as it is at war with the terrorist organization. President Obama announced two weeks ago that he would withdraw the majority of America's troops in Afghanistan by the end of the year, effectively ending the war there as far as the United States is concerned. Administration officials recently told CNN that the president's first preference would be to work with Congress to shut down the terrorist detention camp rather than go it alone, however. And, according to a Politico article from earlier this year, the Obama administration believes that a third of the combatants being held at Guantanamo bay are too dangerous to release outright but are unsuitable for trial, further complicating the matter and making it unlikely the the president will fully close the camp at the end of this year.","One of candidate Barack Obama's promises was that he would shut down Guantanamo Bay .
The president has been unable to do so because Congress passed legislation restricting him from transferring terrorists to prisons on U.S. soil .
Obama is also legally required to show that detainees he repatriates are unlikely to retaliate against the U.S.
A new poll shows closing Guantanamo would be an unpopular move even if the president were able to find a way to shut down the detention facility .
Two in three Americans want Obama to keep Gitmo open ."
"Rangers chairman David Somers shocked fellow directors by seeking a pay-rise – just as the club were lurching towards a new cash crisis. Sportsmail has learned that Somers requested an increase to his salary shortly after agreeing to become executive chairman on a temporary basis on October 30. His request came despite the Rangers board being forced to accept a £2million loan offer from Newcastle owner Mike Ashley to keep the club alive. Ashley subsequently loaned a further £1m – secured against assets – to keep the lights on. Rangers chairman David Somers (second from the left) shocked fellow directors by seeking a pay-rise . Appointed temporary, then permanent, non-executive chairman in November 2013, Somers was detailed to work for Rangers two days a month, but assumed a full-time role following the departure of former chief executive Graham Wallace and finance director Philip Nash. Asked to oversee the search for replacements, eventual appointments Derek Llambias and Barry Leach were already working at the club as consultants and were always expected to fill the posts. On the morning his new role was confirmed, Somers spoke to Sky Sports News outside Ibrox, joking of ‘more work, no more money’. But in a communication with former colleague Nash uncovered under the Data Protection Act last September, the Ibrox chairman had referred to his ‘poor level of remuneration’. It’s unclear if the Rangers board agreed to the Somers request for a salary increase after it was tendered to the club’s Remuneration and Nominations Committee but the proposal outraged former investors Laxey Partners. Phoenix Suns owner and financier Robert Sarver has increased his Rangers takeover bid to £20million . Rangers remain in a perilous financial state as they desperately seek emergency funding. On Thursday, American financier Robert Sarver upped his offer for the club after a previous £18m bid for control was rejected. Sarver should discover on Friday if his improved £20m bid has cut any ice with the embattled Ibrox board. The owner of NBA side the Phoenix Suns also announced that he is ready to offer the crisis-hit club a £6.5m emergency loan to help keep it afloat. However, his ambition to hold a controlling interest in the club can only move forward if 75 per cent of shareholders back such a proposal. In a move that will chime with many in an increasingly disgruntled fan base, the American hinted he would be willing to continue working with two factions who last week snapped up significant stakes in the club. Former Ibrox director Dave King, who purchased 15 per cent of the club, and Douglas Park, George Letham and George Taylor – dubbed the Three Bears - who have a combined interest of around 20 per cent are acting independently with the shared aim of achieving regime change. Sarver failed in his bid to buy a controlling stake of the Ibrox club after offering £18m . Rangers have yet to repay the £3m loan Sports Direct tycoon Ashley gave the club last year while he has also tightened his grip on the club’s retail division. However, Sarver insists he will provide a steady stream of cash to the club if his bid is successful. In a statement given to the Stock Exchange, the 53-year-old said: ‘This new proposal hopefully helps the board deal with the short-term cash flow crunch and also addresses my desire to see the club back on a solid long-term financial footing. ‘It will also enable Rangers to immediately repay the loans from Mike Ashley and Sandy Easdale, and free it of debt. ‘If the board agrees to my proposal, I would provide a total of £16.4m-£20m to be invested in the club as the board determines - £6.5m immediately and the remainder following a share issue, taking the major step necessary to restore financial stability to the club. ‘I know, of course, that there are various groups of prominent fans who have been working hard for a long time to bring change to the club and they can rest assured that I am committed to building a strong partnership with fans and key stakeholders to do what is best for the club. Sarver also offers a £6.5m emergency loan to the cash-strapped club to pay off debts in the short term . ‘I fully realise that a strong sports club needs local investment, local directors and local support to be successful. ‘After everything they have been through in recent years, I understand some (fans) are rightly cautious about a guy they’ve never heard of wanting to get involved in their club. I’d feel exactly the same way. ‘But hopefully I can combine my financial resources and knowledge of professional sport with strong local leaders and top-notch management to bring Rangers back to elite level. ‘I look forward to receiving the response of the Rangers board.’ Curiously, Sarver felt the need to respond to speculation on social media that he was working with other parties. His spokesman said: ‘There appears to be some speculation in online fans’ forums, prompting questions from the media asking if Mr Sarver is working in conjunction with other figures associated with Ibrox. Dave King bought a 14.5 per cent share in the club this month and is keen to protect the club for the fans . ‘Let me assure you he is not. To be very clear, Mr Sarver has never met or spoken to Mike Ashley, Sandy Easdale or James Easdale. ‘And for the complete avoidance of doubt, he has never met or spoken to Charles Green or Craig Whyte. He is not working with, acting for, or alongside any of these individuals. ‘Mr Sarver is acting on his own behalf, although he has repeatedly said that if he succeeds in acquiring a majority stake in Rangers he would like to work with others who clearly have the best long-term interests of Rangers at heart.’ Rangers meantime confirmed they have repaid the £500,000 loan issued by Easdale on Monday after Brentford paid the first installment on their £850,000 purchase of the midfielder Lewis Macleod.","David Somers originally joined Rangers working two days a month .

"Sticky labels on supermarket fruits are set to be replaced by laser 'tattoos' printed onto their skin, under new rulings from the European Union. The EU approved the use of iron oxides and hydroxides in lasering citrus fruit, melons and pomegranates last week and the law comes into force from 23 June. Although the technology has been around since 2009, the use of these chemicals - which enhance the contrast between the lasered and non-lasered parts of the fruit making the mark much clearer - had previously been banned. A new ruling by the European Union means grocers and retailers can now use lasers with iron oxides, hydroxides and other e-numbers to 'tattoo' the skin of fruit. These lasered marks can contain barcodes or fruit information and could be used to replace sticky labels . From 23 June, shops in the EU can laser branding information to the skin of fruits. Suppliers can use the technology to trace where their products are picked and where they're sold . Retailers and suppliers can use the 'tattoos' to mark the fruit and track where it has been and where it is sold. Under the new ruling they can additionally add barcodes or other information to the skin of fruits which removes the need for sticky labels. Trade magazine The Grocer said that the previous ban on the chemicals hindered the adoption of lasering and the publication, along with suppliers, have welcomed the EU's decision. The company behind the technology is Valencia-based Laser Food. It has spent three years liasing with the EU to get the use of iron oxides and hydoroxides approved. It claims that one of the main benefits of laser technology is 'improved traceability for shoppers.' Jaime Sanfelix, managing director of Laser Food, told The Grover: 'Consumers will have absolute certainty the product they are buying is fully guaranteed.' He said that currently loose products were removed from cartons and sold 'anonymously.' Lasering . would also bring considerable cost advantages and environmental savings . for retailers and suppliers as it would remove the need for paper, ink . and glue typically used in sticky labels to add information and branding . to fresh produce. Mr Sanfelix added: 'It limits the risk of losing, mixing up or inverting food items and therefore facilitates transportation and storage.' The EU ruling applies to lasering citrus fruits, such as oranges (pictured), melons and pomegranates. Valencia-based company Laser Food, which develops the technology behind the ruling, worked with the EU to get approval. It has previously branded fruits with Valencia FC badges and other sporting brands . Suppliers also believe the hi-tech . change will provide a huge marketing opportunity for retailers as the . lasering could be used as a promotional tool to mark products with . motifs during special events during the year. For example, Laser Food has previously marked fruit with the Valencia FC football club badge. The company has also previously branded fruit with the Hello Kitty logo. The . amended EU regulations now allows the use of iron oxides, hydroxides, . hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose and polysorbates for marking certain . fruits. These are all . examples of so called E-numbers and can be used to create a contrast . between the laser marking and the fruit's skin. Iron oxides and hyrdoxides are know as E172. They are natural minerals commercially made from iron powder which can be yellow, red, orange, brown or black in colour. Manufactured . by treating a solution of ferrous sulphate or chloride with an alkali . and oxidising the precipitate in hot air. As the iron present in these . oxides is in the ferric form it is not very actively available to body . tissues. E172 can be found in cake and dessert mixes, meat paste, salmon and shrimp paste. They are only used for coating the surfaces of things but are safe to eat because they are not absorbed into the body. Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (E 464) is made from cellulose and commercially prepared from wood and chemically modified. It is mainly used as a thickening agent, but also as filler, dietary fibre, anti clumping agent and emulsfier. Hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose is soluble and can be fermented in the large intestine. Large doses can cause intestinal problems, such as bloating, constipation and diarrhoea. Polysorbates . (E 432-436) is a synthetic compound made from ethylene oxide, sorbitol . and lauric acid  - a naturally occurring fatty acid. It is mainly found in ice cream and soft drinks. Humans . can take in 25mg for each kg of body weight and there are no known side . effects, although people intolerant of propylene glycol should avoid . the E430-E436 group.","Latest EU ruling allows grocers and retailers to use hi-tech lasers to mark the skin of fruit .

"A Department of Homeland Security employee has been put on paid administrative leave after it was discovered that he has been moonlighting as an advocate for a race war. An acquisitions officer for Immigration and Customs Enforcement who deals with small businesses, Ayo Kimathi, operates the website War on the Horizon. It includes descriptions of an 'unavoidable, inevitable clash with the white race.' Kimathi is black. Chameleon: Ayo Kimathi, an acquisitions officer for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, was suspended with pay after it was discovered that he has been moonlighting as an advocate for a race war . Hate speech: Kimathi, who is black, operates the website War on the Horizon, which includes descriptions of an 'unavoidable, inevitable clash with the white race' Kimathi has been with the department since 2009. He was told Friday that he is being suspended with pay. His website criticizes whites, gays, those of mixed race, and blacks who integrate with whites. In his lectures and speeches, some of them available on YouTube, the federal employee heaped abuse on President Obama for his support of gay rights, calling him a ‘goddamn f***** mulatto.’ The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which monitors hate groups, earlier this week reported on Kimathi's role in running the site. Hostile: A former manager at DHS said that 'everybody in the office is afraid' of Kimatha . 'At this point in history, whites worldwide are threatening the existence of every Black man, woman, and child on Earth,' one passage on the site read. 'Since we are the most valuable people . alive and there is no need for this planet’s existence without us, it . is time for us to prepare for the international war for Black survival.' Kimathi, . who calls himself 'the irritated Genie,' received permission to launch . the site after falsely telling his supervisors at the DHS that War on the . Horizon was set up to sell concert and lecture videos. Author: Kimathi wrote a book under the pen name the Irritated Genie of Soufees on the subject of the effeminization of the black male by whites, which retails on Amazon for more than $756 . ‘He called it simply WOH, never saying that WOH stood for War on the Horizon,’ the report stated. ICE spokeswoman Gillian Christensen said in a written statement that the agency ‘does not condone any type of hateful rhetoric or advocacy of violence of any kind against anyone.’ The Alabama-based SPLC said in its report that Kimathi's site declares: ‘in order for Black people to survive the 21st century, we are going to have to kill a lot of whites – more than our Christian hearts can possibly count.' A former manager at DHS reportedly told SPLC that 'everybody in the office is afraid of him,' adding that his co-workers have expressed concerns that one day, Kimathi would bring a gun 'and go postal.' His hate-filled rhetoric aside, however, Kimathi’s ex-supervisor described him as a ‘suave’ professional with a ‘commanding presence’ who excelled at his job advocating for small business owners. The radical activist appears to have a long list of enemies, among them Rev. Al Sharpton, Lil Wayne, Oprah Winfrey, Whoopi Goldberg, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell, dubbed by him ‘Colon,’ and the long-deceased FBI director ‘Gay Edgar Hoover.’ Besides preparing members of the black . race for war on whites, Kimathi also has been going after gays and . lesbians, while accusing the US government of pursuing a secret agenda . of trying to ‘effeminize’ the black male as a way of destroying the race. Firebrand: Besides running the website, Kimathi also has been giving lectures and speeches advocating for a war of whites and homosexuals . Anti-gay: Lomathi lambasted President Obama for his support of LGBT community in 2009 speech . Harsh words: Kimathi said he was disillusioned with Michelle Obama for wearing a 'lingerie'-style dress on the cover of People magazine . A book on the subject titled ‘War on the Horizon: Black Resistance to the white-sex Assault,’ which was apparently written by Kimathi under the pen name the Irritated Genie of Soufees, retails on Amazon for more than $756, the Huffington Post reported. In a particularly incendiary video from August 2009 posted on his YouTube page, which was unearthed by the site Mediate, Kimathi delivered a racially charged and homophobic speech blasting President Obama as a' goddamn f***** mullato' for his efforts to extend rights to members of the LGBT community.

"She's famous for her penchant for recycling outfits and a visit to charity Only Connect proved no exception for the Duchess of Cambridge. The new mother looked fresh-faced and seemed in good spirits as she arrived on the arm of her husband, the Duke of Cambridge, to be greeted by cheering crowds on Pentonville Road. But while the Duchess appeared as youthful as ever, her brown patterned Orla Kiely dress was of an older vintage. Thrifty: The Duchess' Orla Kiely dress first appeared during a visit to a school in Oxford . Looking good: The Duchess was stylish in her Orla Kiely shirt-dress, brown suede boots and chic black clutch . Bought in a sale for £162.50 - reduced from £325 - the brown and cream frock made its first appearance during a visit to a school art class in Oxford in February 2012. Although the dress didn't quite escape unscathed from that engagement and ended up splattered with paint, it looked good as new as the Duchess mingled with crowds outside Only Connect's Pentonville Road headquarters. And the dress wasn't the only part of her outfit making a repeat appearance: her brown suede ankle boots and black clutch were also on their second outing. Both appeared with the dress during . the Oxford visit, during which the Duchess met children helped by the . charity The Art Room, of which she is a patron. Gift: Mr Russell-Andrews and his baby daughter Teegan present the Duchess with a babygro for Prince George . Delighted: The Duchess beams as Mr Russell-Andrew unfolds the tiny black and white garment for her to see . After making their way past the . waiting press pack, the royal couple toured the offices of Only Connect, . a charity which helps rehabilitate prisoners, ex-offenders and . disadvantaged young people seen as being at risk of offending and . carries out programmes in prisons and schools across the capital. During . the visit, the Duchess of Cambridge spoke of her baby son Prince . George, and revealed that youngster is growing up fast as she accepted . the gift of a personalised babygro from a young ex-offender, Aaron . Russell-Andrews. His daughter, 20-month-old Teegan, tried to take the present back from Kate - after which she sympathised with Mr Russell-Andrews about how demanding babies can be. At a nearby Only Connect venue, OC Central, the pair were treated to contemporary dance performances by the group Dance United and had the opportunity to meet those connected to the charity, including Mr Russell-Andrews and his little girl. Mr Russell-Andrews, 22, from Camden, north London, became involved with Only Connect four years ago after committing a crime a day as a teenager - including robbery, burglary and vehicle theft - and is now a professional actor. He said: 'She was very pleased that Only Connect has helped me make such a big change with my life and keep me on the right path.' Friendly: The Duchess enjoys a chat with Elise Johnson and Nasser Massadimi during a sewing class . Dance: The royal couple look on as some of the young offenders at Only Connect put on a dance display . Asked what Kate thought of the white babygro, which featured the Only Connect logo and the words Prince George underneath, Mr Russell-Andrews said: 'She was very pleased about it. She said it's a very good fit because he's growing very fast, and that he'll like it. Teegan tried to take back the babygro, she's very cheeky.' He added: 'Kate said: ""They're very demanding at this age"".' While Teegan was all smiles with Kate, she burst into tears when William started speaking to her father - but she was soon placated with a piece of chocolate cake made by trainees from Switchback, which aims for rehabilitation through catering. Kate tried two pieces of their cakes herself, one an iced ginger sponge and the other a chocolate cake. William's . aunt Lady Jane Fellowes, the older sister of Diana, Princess of Wales, . is a trustee of Only Connect and described them as carrying out 'inspiring and life-changing work' in a recent interview. Impressed: The Duke of Cambridge later spoke of his admiration for the dancers and their performance . Glowing: It seems Kate may have had a very subtle dye applied, as her hair appears darker . Elegant: Kate on November 7, meeting military supporters and servicemen as part of London Poppy Day, with those silver strands on show . Business: The royal couple appeared relaxed - despite the watching press pack - as they arrived at the charity . Stylish: The Duchess made her recycled outfit look good as new during the appearance in London . A Kensington Palace spokeswoman said it was a coincidence that she is involved however and that the duke and duchess wanted to see the work of the charity as part of their interest in young people, describing it as a 'learning and scoping exercise'. Speaking . after their visit, Lady Jane said: 'I'm really delighted that William . and Catherine have had the opportunity to see the work of Only Connect, a . charity that I have been supporting for many years.' During the visit, William chatted to dancers Moshood Ibrahim, 20, and Jannick Moth, 22, from . Dance United and asked them if there had been a technical glitch - . having noticed that music for their modern dance piece only kicked in . half-way through. William said to them: 'I could hear clattering going on behind me. So there was a problem? I loved how you guys just rolled with it.' Karis . Barnard, centre manager at OC Central, spoke to the duchess about . programmes the charity runs to help young people, which also reaches out . to them through the arts, including poetry.She said: 'She said . she wasn't so good at poetry but her photography is her passion. If . she's going to do anything artistic, it's that.' Charity visit: The Duchess of Cambridge emerges from her car before heading into the Only Connect offices . During the . visit, the royal couple watched workshops being carried out by . complementary projects Handmade Alliance, which trains prisoners to . produce textiles for British designers, and Bounce Back, which offers . training and employment in painting and decorating for offenders at the . end of their sentences. Kate watched volunteers Elise Johnson and . Nasser Massadimi making bunting, and said to them: 'Are you guys sewing . on buttons? It looks very fiddly work.' She added: 'It's quite therapeutic, isn't it?' Danny . Kruger, chief executive of Only Connect, which employs 25 people, told . William and Kate he was 'enormously proud' to welcome them to their . headquarters. Mr Kruger, whose wife Emma founded the charity . eight years ago, spoke to them about the importance of charities working . together. After the two-hour visit ended, he said: 'It was a . great thing to have them giving us a pat on the back and for our members . to get congratulated for their work and achievements, and I hope it . means we can build our profile and do more work.' Support: The Royal couple were at the offices of Only Connect which helps rehabilitate young offenders . Official: Prince William will be taking on more royal duties after resigning from his Search and Rescue role . Waiting: Photographers waited for hours in icy conditions outside the charity's Pentonville Road headquarters . Thrifty Kate's worn this piece before. The Orla Kiely dresscoat worn by the Duchess of Cambridge sold out ‘within minutes’ of a public appearance on February 22 2012, a spokeswoman for the label said at the time. Kate wore the coat for her first public engagement as royal patron of The Art Room, which encourages confidence in disadvantaged children. The Duchess of Cambridge wore the coat to visit a school on February 22, 2012 (left) and again today (right) Orla Kiely is famed for her retro, 70s-inspired prints . And she was so keen to get stuck in that . she ended up with red paint on the sleeve of her wool jacquard coat . after taking part in a class. As soon as the duchess was spotted wearing the brown dove-patterned garment, there was an ‘absolute frenzy’ on the website, according to a the brand. The Birdie wool jacquard shirt dress was on sale for £162.50, down from £325. Sadly, for Kate fashion fans, it is no longer on sale. Kiely is an Irish contemporary designer, based in London, known for her unique retro prints and designs. She has been dubbed the 'Queen of Prints' by the fashion world. A suitable choice for the future Queen of England, perhaps. Trained in textile design, she began her career designing hats, but moved on to  handbags, clothing and a variety of other items - including kitchenware and cars. Kate's also worn dresses by the designer. The new mum wore a steel-grey dress from Orla Kiely's Autumn Winter 2011 collection to the Dulwich Picture Gallery in March 2012. At the time Kiely told Grazia magazine: 'When Kate wears one of your designs you get a boost.' 'The phone was ringing off the hook – email went, and one of my team counted over 800 Google alerts in that time! The only thing was, it was the end of the season so we didn’t have so many of the dresses in stock. But it’s a nice thing to happen.'","The Duchess was visiting crime support charity Only Connect in London .

"Harry Redknapp has admitted that QPR have been more solid recently when Rio Ferdinand has been out of the team. Ferdinand is available again to the QPR manager after serving a three-match ban for using the word 'sket' on twitter, which also cost him a £25,000 fine, and the defender hopes to return to the starting lineup for Saturday's match at home to fellow strugglers Leicester. The former Manchester United and England man was left on the bench for the R's matches against Liverpool and Aston Villa before missing games against Chelsea, Manchester City and Newcastle. Queens Park Rangers manager Harry Redknapp admits his side have been more solid without Rio Ferdinand . Ferdinand (right), in training with the QPR squad, has struggled to adapt to life in west London . And his manager admits that Ferdinand has struggled to adapt to life at Loftus Road and that the R's have looked better defensively in his absence. 'It's been difficult,' Redknapp said. 'He's come from a team used to winning every week and everything to a team out of the championship and has found it more difficult. 'So it's a more difficult period. Maybe he wasn't getting an awful lot of protection in the early games either. Him, Steven Caulker, whoever played at the back – it wasn't just Rio. They found it difficult in them early in them early games. I think we've looked more solid recently but no, I've got no problems with Rio.' QPR manager Harry Redknapp's (left)  side lost 1-0 to Newcastle to go bottom of the table last weekend . Ferdinand has been carrying a knock recently which he should shake off for the visit of the Foxes and if he does then Redknapp insists he has nothing to prove. He added: 'Rio is hopefully going to be fit. We'll have a look and assess hit fitness and see how he is but Rio doesn't have anything to prove to anyone, he's been a fantastic player for so many years so there's no problem, he's not one that I have to worry about.' Redknapp has been dealt a blow with the news Sandro will be out until 2015 after injuring his medial knee ligaments in the 1-0 defeat at Newcastle last weekend, and he revealed that the Brazilian midfielder could have been out for a year having viewed the incident a slow-motion replay of the incident. Queens Park Rangers will be without Brazilian midfieler Sandro until after Christmas . VIDEO QPR need stability - Ferdinand . Redknapp added: 'It could have been a real damaging one for him and could have put him out for a year. That is a big blow to us, losing him until after the Christmas period. 'He took a bad bang on his knee. We looked the video of it and it could have been even worse. 'The bang he took on that knee, it could have been an awful lot worse, and his knee must have been very strong to take that. It is not easy for him but he has got to come back stronger.","Rio Ferdinand is available for QPR after serving a three-match ban .

"The cyberattack on Sony Pictures that released the social security numbers, salary details and other secrets of 47,000 employees originated from a $250-per-night, five-star hotel in Bangkok, Thailand, it was revealed today. Bloomberg News  has revealed new details of the attack, which has shaken the Hollywood studio to its core. Nearly all of the signs point to North Korean hackers being behind the network invasion. The reclusive hermit regime in Pyongyang has denied being behind the cyberattack, but released a statement Sunday saying that it may have been a 'righteous deed of the supporters and sympathizers' of North Korea. The St. Regis Bangkok is a glittery five-star luxury hotel in the Thai city's richest shopping district. Authorities say they have traced the attack to the hotel's internet network . The St. Regis has rooms that start at $250 a night and go up to $10,600 for the penthouse suite, which comes with its own butler . The North Korean statement also made reference to Sony Pictures producing 'The Interview,' a comedy that stars Seth Rogen and James Franco as talk show hosts who try to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. It has been speculated that Sony was targeted because of the film, which is set to be released on Christmas Day. Bloomberg reports that investigators have traced the attack last weekend back to the St. Regis Bangkok hotel, a five-star resort in Thailand's capital. Authorities are not sure whether the hackers stayed as guests at the hotel, simply used the wifi in the lobby, or routed the traffic through the hotel. The luxury resort has rooms starting at $250 per night, going up to the penthouse suite, which features a private pool and a personal butler for $10,600 a night. The attack on Sony Pictures may have been the result of the studio producing 'The Interview,' which is a comedy about an assassination attempt on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un . North Korea has already reacted angrily to 'The Interview,' which stars James Franco and Seth Rogen . The St. Regis Bangkok is owned by Starwood Hotels and Resorts, a Connecticut-based company that also owns Westin, Sheraton and the W hotel chains. The St. Regis, a glittering high-rise hotel, is located on Rajadmari Road in a section of Bangkok known for its high-end boutiques for the likes of Bulgari and Valentino. Sources tell Bloomberg that forensic evidence indicates that the Sony attack was carried out by the same hackers who pulled off the DarkSeoul cyber assault of South Korean banks and media companies in 2013. The DarkSeoul hackers were linked to North Korea, which employs at least 5,900 hackers - many of whom operate outside the country, where electricity is unreliable and internet access is scarce. According to details released by the FBI, key pieces of the malware used in the attack have the same names and construction as the malware used in the DarkSeoul attack. In both attacks, hackers also defaced websites with skeletons and political slogans.","Evidence from hack attack on Sony Pictures points to North Korea .

"Hate crime: Island Nettles was beaten into a coma by a Facebook friend who only moments earlier realized she was born a man . A transgender woman in New York has died after being beaten by a group of men who attacked her and yelled gay slurs. The victim, 21-year-old Islan Nettles, died Thursday in a Harlem hospital after being taken off life support five days following the attack. Nettles was pronounced brain after being beaten on the street by one of her Facebook friends, 20-year-old Paris Wilson. According to Nettles' family, the young woman had two Facebook profiles - one using her birth name Vaughn Nettles and another 'female' profile. Wilson was friends with Nettles on her female profile. When she ran into Wilson last Saturday near a police precinct on Eighth Avenue and 147th Street in Harlem, he started flirting with her. But his male friends were quick to inform him that Nettles was born a man. Angered at being embarrassed in front of his friends, Wilson started to beat up Nettles while his friends verbally harassed her. Wilson, a rising senior at Buffalo State University, wouldn't let up on Nettles, issuing blow after blow even after she hit her head on the pavement. Nettles' friends informed cops, but Nettles was already unconscious by the time they arrived and broke up the fight. The attack happened at an intersection off of Eighth Avenue in Harlem near a police precinct. Hate crimes against the gay community in New York have seen a dramatic increase this year . 'He deserves to rot': Nettles' mother Delores says she hopes Wilson will spend the rest of his life in prison . According to the criminal complaint, witnesses say Nettles was found passed out on the ground with a swollen shut eye and blood on her face. After the attack, Nettles was hospitalized, slipped into a coma and later died. The witness eventually told detectives about the anti-gay remarks- after initially leaving them out of the criminal report- and the hate crimes task force took over the investigation. Wilson was charged on a misdemeanor assault charge, but now that Nettles has died and her death ruled a homicide, he will likely face murder charges. He was released on $2,000 bail. Delores Nettles, the victim's mother, hopes that her daughter's killer will spend the rest of his life in jail. 'He deserves to rot because he took a life,' she told the New York Daily News. Now, she and the rest of the victim's family are planning for Islan's funeral. 'I accepted him no matter what because I loved him at the end of the day,' she said. 'My son was a beautiful woman.' Murdered: Nettles died at Harlem Hospital after being ruled brain dead and taken off life support. Her attacker will likely face murder charges now that her death has been ruled a homicide . The attack on Nettles was the latest in a spate of bias incidents this year in New York and a total of 68 have been reported so far this year, showing a significant increase from the 54 that were reported in all of last year. The bias attacks this year range from yelled slurs to the May killing of a 32-year-old gay man in Greenwich Village. Police stepped up patrols this summer in response. In May, police said Mark Carson, 32, was first taunted with homophobic slurs, then shot in the head in Greenwich Village, not far from the site of 1969 riots that helped give rise to the gay rights movement. A suspect was arrested on a charge of murder as a hate crime. The killing, and other bias attacks, sparked a summer protest attended by thousands. Some of the other bias incidents this summer included an assault last week where two men were attacked in Chelsea. Christine Quinn, the city's first openly gay City Council speaker and a mayoral candidate, denounced the most recent attack. 'An attack against one person, or one community, is an assault against all New Yorkers,' she said in a joint statement with other council members. 'We ask all New Yorkers to come together, to embrace our differences and to denounce hate violence.'","Islan Nettles, 21, died last Thursday following an alleged hate crime in Harlem .

"Every single major artery on Britain's railways will remain closed on Boxing Day, leaving millions stranded or pushing them onto the roads. No trains will run between England and Scotland or Wales on the East Coast, West Coast or Great Western mainlines - and the Midland, Cross Country and East Anglia lines will also remain shut. The near-non-existent service has returned this year despite a fierce political battle over the so-called Boxing Day shutdown dating back to at least 2007. Scroll down to find out which trains will be running . Leaving the city? Perish the thought - every cross-country artery will be closed again on Boxing Day . Labour and Tories have repeatedly traded accusations over the lack of service, which affects football fans, families without cars and shop workers in the Boxing Day sales. Apart from airport shuttles and Eurostar, only Chiltern, Scotrail, Southeastern and Southern will be running any trains on December 26. Even then the services will be extremely limited and only call at major stations. Not even the Heathrow Express train from London to its largest airport will be running, despite terminals remaining open on Boxing Day. Campaigners blamed a 'blind spot' in the set-up of private rail franchises which puts no obligation on firms to run services on December 26. Bruce Williamson, spokesman for the passenger group Railfuture, told MailOnline: 'Things need to improve. No trains: London Liverpool Street station is deserted in 2008 due to over-running festive maintenance work . 'Even trains not running on Christmas Day is a relatively new development - I believe British Rail were running Christmas Day trains as recently as 1981. 'We appreciate it sometimes makes more sense to extend Christmas engineering works to Boxing Day to give yourself a major chunk of time, but we're calling for more lines to be open next year. Jams: Drivers will be stranded or forced to take to the road to reach family, sales and sports fixtures . 'The problem is it's a blind spot in the way the Department for Transport runs its franchise agreement with the operating companies. 'They're under no obligation to run on Boxing Day and it's often a loss leader because you don't have huge numbers of people travelling.' He added: 'Personally I'm already down at my mother's house in Devon. I drove because I didn't want to be stranded, and because I'm sure the trains will be absolutely rammed to the gills today.' Despite the complaints Boxing Day is traditionally quiet compared to normal commuting days - so many firms are using the opportunity to do engineering work. London Bridge station, one of the largest in the capital, will see one of the most disruptive parts of its five-year upgrade this week as part of the £6billion Thameslink programme. A Department for Transport spokesman told MailOnline: 'Deciding the level of service on specific days is a matter for train operators. 'But we know passengers want to travel on Boxing Day, and that’s why we have worked with the rail industry to ensure there are limited services on some franchises on that day. 'Network Rail and train companies have ensured that a large part of the railway will remain open over the Christmas/New Year period and alternative routes are provided where the lines are closed for essential engineering work, and that these are communicated properly to the public.' One group that will be worst-hit are football supporters - with ten major Premier League fixtures on Boxing Day involving some of the nation's biggest clubs. Tottenham Hotspur fans  face a 100-mile trek to a 3pm kick-off against Leicester City while Aston Villa fans will have to travel 150 miles for their club's draw against Swansea City. Football trip: Tottenham Hotspur fans face a 100-mile trek to a 3pm kick-off against Leicester City at the King Power Stadium (pictured) Football Supporters' Federation chairman Malcolm Clarke told the Daily Mirror: 'This is a ­significant issue for a lot of fans. Not just away fans - without public transport even home fans can find a three or four mile journey almost impossible. 'This is one of the biggest footballing days of the calendar. It is a shame nothing has changed.' Similar chaos in previous years prompted transport minister Stephen Hammond to tell the Commons in January there was 'no reason' why lines without engineering works shouldn't run. While in opposition Mr Hammond slammed the Labour government over Boxing Day line closures, saying they were 'condemning sports fans and families trying to celebrate the Christmas period together to misery on our clogged-up motorways.' But he was sacked in July's reshuffle and today Labour accused the Tories of hypocrisy. Shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher told the Mirror: 'They had four and a half years to do something about this, but the lack of action shows they never really cared'. Politics: The Boxing Day shutdown has been the subject of party political spats since at least 2007 . A spokesman for the campaign group Passenger Focus said operators often had no choice but to close lines on Boxing Day. 'This is nothing new,' he told MailOnline. 'If the operators did decide to run services on Boxing Day that's usually the period when Network Rail wants to shut the network down anyway for engineering work. 'The people who are put at a disadvantage are the leisure traveller, such as football fans, who want to travel and come across a lot of engineering work. If you are a commuter Monday to Friday you're less likely to encounter that. 'But we have been calling for investment and improvement and the quiet Christmas period is the ideal time to do that. You have to go with the numbers, and Christmas is a traditionally quiet time'.","Every single  artery closed including all lines into Scotland and Wales .

Ms Jolly's devastated mother Sylvia Duddle, 61, told the M.E.N: 'We were in contact again, it was like a fresh start. 'She was supposed to be coming to one of my other daughter’s houses today and stay for Christmas. I’m absolutely devastated. I feel broken - like my heart has been ripped out.' Ms Jolly also leaves behind five sisters, four brothers and a step-brother. Mr Ward's bereft sister Theresa McCoy said she was at her brother's side when he died. The 47-year-old said: 'It doesn't feel real, we don't know what to think yet. He would have been in here having a Christmas drink with us. I can't believe he's gone.' The incident took place as the couple were crossing Princess Road at the junction of Greenheys Lane outside an Asda superstore at about 10.15pm yesterday. Both were hit by a blue Vauxhall Corsa.

"A federal judge has thrown out a lawsuit brought by an Arizona sheriff that sought to halt President Barack Obama's plan to spare nearly 5 million people from deportation. U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell, herself nominated to the federal bench by Obama in 2010, said Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio had legal standing to challenge the immigration program the president announced last month. She suggested the topic is better left for Congress and the Obama administration to sort out. The case 'raises important questions regarding the impact of illegal immigration on this nation, but the questions amount to generalized grievances which are not proper for the judiciary to address,' Howell wrote. The White House held up the decision on Wednesday as confirmation that the president's executive actions are on the up and up. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Maricopa County, Ariz., Sheriff Joe Arpaio, seen in 2013, is an outspoken opponent of Obama's immigration policy; his county is near the U.S.-Mexico border . President Obama, whose landmark immigration policy decree is under fire, arrived Friday in Hawaii for an extended family holiday vacation . 'Judge Howell's decision today confirms what the Department of Justice and scholars throughout the country have been saying all along: the president's executive actions on immigration are lawful,' White House spokesman Eric Schultz said. 'The Supreme Court and Congress have made clear that federal officials can set priorities in enforcing our immigration laws, and the actions announced by the president are consistent with those taken by administrations of both parties for the last half century.' In the first courtroom battle over Obama's plan, Arpaio's lawyer, Larry Klayman, told reporters on Monday that the president violated the U.S. Constitution by doing an end-run around Congress.wever, there are 'serious issues of constitutionality involved' in the president's actions. 'It's not policy, he's creating law and he cannot do that under the U.S. Constitution,' Klayman said in remarks outside the courtroom. He argued that the program would let more illegal immigrants enter the country and commit crimes, burdening law enforcement – Arpaio's area of concern. 'It's not policy, he's creating law and he cannot do that under the U.S. Constitution,' Klayman said of Obama. Arpaio has often clashed with the federal government over the enforcement of immigration laws and he has filed suit to stop new policies announced by Obama. He claims that more than 35 percent of immigrants living in Maricopa County illegally who wound up in his jails this year were repeat offenders, buttressing his view that federal officials have done a poor job of deporting criminals. But Justice Department lawyer Kathleen Hartnett said Arpaio's lawsuit seemed to be raising a 'political dispute' rather than a legal claim the court could address. The Obama administration had called the case 'speculative and unsubstantiated' and had urged the court to dismiss it. Howell at times seemed exasperated with Klayman, a longtime conservative activist who has filed hundreds of lawsuits against the federal government, including challenges to Obama's U.S. citizenship, during his presentation. When Klayman said his client has been threatened because of his tough views on Obama's immigration policy, Howell responded: 'That just doesn't cut it for me.' Howell also said it did not appear that Arpaio could show a 'concrete' injury he has suffered from the new policy, especially since it will take months before the bulk of it actually goes into effect. 'If Congress doesn't like it, doesn't Congress have the power to step in?' she asked. Judge Beryl A. Howell, nominated by Barack Obama, heard the case focused on claims that the president has violated the Constitution by doing an end run around Congress and that drastic changes in immigration programs should be stopped . Obama's plan, derided by conservatives as an 'amnesty' for millions of lawbreakers, marks the most sweeping change to the nation's immigration policies in nearly three decades and set off a fierce fight on Capitol Hill. The changes include work permits and three-year deportation stays for more than 4 million immigrants here illegally. It mostly applies to those who have been in the country more than five years and have children who are U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents. Under the program, the Department of Homeland Security would prioritize the removal of immigrants who present threats to national security, public safety or border security. DHS officials could deport someone if an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office director determined that removing the person would serve an important federal interest. The White House has insisted that Obama is acting under proper legal authority to enforce the nation's immigration laws. Larry Klayman of the conservative nonprofit Freedom Watch is representing the Maricopa County, Arizona sheriff's office in the lawsuit, and filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to stop Obama from granting legal status to approximately 4.7 illegal aliens in the United States . Arpaio has suffered a series of stinging political defeats in his quest to slow the flow of illegal immigrants into his Arizona county. Just last week he agreed to give up a major part of his efforts that won him popularity among voters but gradually were dismantled by the Obama administration and the courts. Arpaio's office said Dec. 17 that it would disband a controversial squad that has raided businesses to arrest more than 700 immigrants who were charged with using fake or stolen IDs to get jobs. After complaints from the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups that charged he was engaging in racial profiling – most illegal immigrants in Arizona are Hispanic – his office was found to have done so at least in some traffic stops. As a result the federal government had stripped him of special federal immigration powers and investigated him for alleged civil rights violations. Arpaio, however, remains popular in Arizona, where voters have elected him six times. He is best known for operating a series of outdoor 'tent city' jails where male inmates are limited to wearing pink underwear and those over age 18 are required to register for the Selective Service military draft. In 2007 he launched an in-house jail radio station that broadcasts patriotic songs, Frank Sinatra tunes, educational shows and classical music 20 hours each week.","America's 'toughest sheriff' wanted to force Washington to stop the flow of illegal-immigrant criminals into his southern Arizona county .

"A widower whose wife was killed in front of their toddler son when an 85-year-old driver confused the pedals of his car has made an impassioned plea for his family's story to be used as a cautionary tale against dangerous driving among the elderly. Ben Brooks-Dutton said he has been left 'utterly bereft' by the loss of his wife Desreen, killed in 2012 by pensioner Geoffrey Lederman in Hampstead, north west London. Lederman was jailed this week for 18 months for mistaking the accelerator of his 1950s Mercedes for its brake. Despite his grief, Mr Brooks-Dutton said he never wanted to see the man behind bars. No amount of suffering on the part of the man culpable for his wife's death would relieve his heartache. But in a moving plea to families concerned their elderly relatives may not be fit enough to drive, the 35-year-old father has begged them to share his story. Here, the MailOnline publishes Mr Brooks-Dutton's request, Tell Them. Desreen Brooks was killed in 2012 in front of her husband Ben (pictured together) and their son . 'The eighty-five-year-old driver who killed my wife, Desreen, was jailed today for eighteen months for causing her death by dangerous driving. He was also banned from driving for life. 'I suspect he, his family and friends are feeling really quite dreadful right now, and, for what it’s worth, mine and I aren’t exactly celebrating either. Geoffrey Lederman was jailed for 18 months last week . 'You see, I’ve had time to think since attending the trial and I’ve realised that you can punish a crime but you can’t transfer pain. 'Any suffering caused to the defendant as a result of his sentencing could in no way take away mine. I’ve since learned that, having suffered so much myself, I genuinely wish no hurt on any other person and I never wished a prison sentence on the driver, either. 'In fact, I wasn’t even going to mention the sentencing on my blog at all. 'But then I reminded myself that justice for Desreen is best served not by a prison sentence but by trying to prevent similar unnecessary deaths from happening again in future. 'I keep hearing people say that they know someone who should probably give up driving but that they don’t know how to raise the issue with them. Well maybe I can help with that. 'Tell them that the judge who sentenced the driver today said, ‘An elderly driver who knows, or should acknowledge, that he or she is losing his or her faculties is no less a danger than a drunken driver who knows the same.’ 'Tell them that the judge also explained that the defendant’s ‘lifetime of blameless driving is of no comfort to the Brooks-Dutton family,’ (and I assure you it really isn’t). 'Tell them that the detective sergeant in charge of the prosecution said, ‘It is important for motorists to regularly monitor their driver behaviour and that of their elderly relatives to ensure that the roads are safe for all road users.’ 'Tell them that the once ‘blameless’ elderly driver suffered pedal confusion, which caused his car to be travelling at an average of fifty-four miles per hour in a twenty zone when he struck and killed my wife. 'Tell them that the impact of this pedal confusion caused one of her shoes to fly off her feet as his speeding car hit her on the pavement where she was walking blamelessly with our then two-year-old son and me. 'Tell them that I had to keep looking at that shoe in the street on the night of her death and in photographs over the course of the subsequent trial. 'Tell them that this is the last photo ever taken of my wife with our son together. Tell them that the paramedics on the scene later that evening had to cut off the jumper she is pictured wearing in order to be able to perform CPR on the pavement where she lay dying. 'Tell them this is the last photo ever taken of my wife with our son together. The paramedics on the scene later that evening had to cut off the jumper she is pictured wearing to perform CPR' 'Tell them the collision investigator found a piece of the pushchair my son is pictured in in the street after the car skimmed it before mowing down his mother' 'Tell them that the day after my wife was killed my son was upset that he couldn’t find his scooter. Tell them that’s because his scooter was found in the wreckage too.' 'Tell them that what happened was almost even more catastrophic and that the car that killed my wife almost killed our son too. 'Tell them that the collision investigator found a piece of the pushchair he is pictured in here in the street after the car skimmed it before mowing down his mother. 'Tell them that the day after my wife was killed my son was upset that he couldn’t find his scooter. Tell them that’s because his scooter was found in the wreckage too. 'Tell them that every time I look at my favourite picture of my wife and me together I get upset as I imagine how I lost the hat I am pictured wearing on the night of her death. 'Tell them that I’ve concluded that I must have inadvertently thrown it into the street as I pulled at my own hair through fear that she was going to die. Tell them they won’t be the only people who have to deal with the consequences of any potential injury or fatality that they might cause. 'Tell them the impact will be felt by more people than they can imagine including their own family and friends. 'Tell them that the two-year-old boy who lost his mummy is now four and is still so angry and upset that she can’t come back. 'Tell them that he has suffered immeasurably from the trauma of that night. 'Show them this picture and tell them that this is him pictured with his beautiful mummy on his second birthday – the last one they would ever spend together. 'Tell them that at thirty-one years old I was the happiest man alive when I married the love of my life. 'Tell them that I was utterly bereft when I lost her at thirty-three. 'Show them this picture and tell them that this is him pictured with his beautiful mummy on his second birthday – the last one they would ever spend together' Tell them that every time I look at my favourite picture of my wife and me together I get upset as I imagine how I lost the hat I am pictured wearing on the night of her death . 'Tell them I’ve thirty-five now and depressed. 'Tell them that I put a good face on but that the truth is that things haven’t really got much easier. Tell them from me how hard it is to be a bereaved single parent. 'Tell them that once disaster strikes no wishing the tables could be turned will help. 'Tell them that wanting to switch places with the young person killed will make no difference to those who survive. 'Tell them that you understand that they may want to stay mobile but remind them of what’s at risk. 'Tell them any of these things you like; print this blog post off, email it on, share it online and let it speak for itself. 'Tell me you’ll help prevent this happening again, though. 'Just tell me that so that one day I can tell my son that his mother’s death wasn’t completely in vain.' Mr Brooks-Dutton's book, It's Not Raining Daddy, It's Happy can be found here.

"An Iraq veteran is angry and upset with U.S. Airways after he says he and his service dog were mistreated on a recent flight from Florida to Detroit. Ex-Marine Eric Calley, from Williamston, Michigan, suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after serving two tours of duty. His constant companion nowadays is a Doberman pinscher called Sun, who is specially trained to help him with his PTSD.She goes everywhere with him including on the December 7 flight. Ex-Marine Eric Calley, from Williamston, Michigan, is angry and upset after he says he and his service dog were mistreated on a recent flight from Florida to Detroit . Calley was sitting in coach when a flight attendant from first class walked over and repeatedly yelled at him because Sun had put her front paws on an empty seat next to him during some turbulence. The flight attendant was so apparently rude that a dozen or so passengers got involved and some filed complaints when they landed. 'It was blatant disrespect. I couldn't just sit there and not say something,' said Chuck Aaron of Charlotte, Mich., who also served in Iraq. 'He [the flight attendant] started telling us that he was going to have the police waiting when we landed because we were being hostile,' Aaron told the Lansing State Journal. U.S. Airways apologized this week and sent Calley a letter saying 'it appears our airport personnel didn't handle the situation with the quality customer care we expect.' But Calley has said the apology isn't good enough and that the attendant's bad behavior was just one of example of how the airline mistreated him. Calley served two tours of duty in Iraq, left, and his constant companion nowadays is a Doberman pinscher called Sun, who is specially trained to help him with his PTSD . He says airline employees twice described him to other passengers as having a medical disability and also asked him to provide proof that Sun is a service dog. Calley, who works as an advocate on behalf of other returning veterans, has said he is speaking out about his experience because he wants to raise awareness about the lack of recognition given to vets with PTSD and how it is a growing problem. 'We are going to continue to have this huge influx of new veterans coming back,' he said. Calley, who was part of the first wave of American troops who invaded Iraq in 2003, said it took him several years of struggling to adjust to normal life after he left the Marines. During that time he battled alcoholism to cope flashbacks and panic attacks, but says Sun has rescued him. 'Dogs are 10 times more intuitive than humans. They pick up things way more than we do,' he said. U.S. Airways apologized this week but Calley isn't happy and says his treatment is typical of the lack of recognition given to the needs of vets with PTSD . Sun monitors his heart rate, breathing, the tension in his muscles and can help calm him down by wedging her snout under his arm to calm him or jumping into his lap to put warm pressure on his chest. If Calley has a nightmare, Sun wakes him up with a nudge of her cold nose. 'If you have a flashback, and say you're dreaming you're overseas and you wake up, you still think you're over there for a while. She helps you get out of that. She brings you back to real time,' he said. Leslie Scott, a spokeswoman for the airline's parent company American Airlines, wouldn't comment on whether any disciplinary action was taken against the flight attendant. She said several airline employees, many of whom are veterans, volunteer with a program called Puppies in Flight to acclimate service dogs to flying.","Eric Calley, from Williamston, Michigan, is angry and upset after he says he and his service dog were mistreated on a recent flight .

"Ethic minority voters are abandoning Labour according to a poll which shows the number of Indian, African and Caribbeans who support the party has fallen since 2010. The party has traditionally benefited from the ethnic minority vote, especially with people of Afro-Caribbean descent. However, figures from the British Election Study reportedly show that the number of African voters who say they identify with Ed Miliband's party has slipped from 79 to 63 per cent since 1997, while Caribbean support has fallen from 78 to 67 per cent. Scroll down for video . Ethic minority voters are abandoning Labour according to a poll which shows the number of Indian, African and Caribbeans who support the party has fallen since 2010 . More worrying for Miliband will be Indian support collapsing from 77 per cent to 45 per cent - a fall of more than three-quarters - while support among people of Pakistani origin has fallen from 77 to 57 per cent, according to the figures revealed by theTelegraph. 'The ethnic minorities are seen to be the core of Labour party vote, they have been for years, for decades but I will make these people here representing Labour a little bit uncomfortable about this assumption that minorities will vote for them as a matter of course,' Dr Maria Sobolewska, an expert from Manchester University and part of the team conducting the Ethnic Minority British Election Study, told a conference this month, according to the newspaper's website. News that Labour is falling out of favour with ethnic minority voters comes after research released earlier this year predicted that Britain's black and ethnic minority communities could account for almost a third of the population by 2050. Research released earlier this year predicted that Britain's black and ethnic minority communities could account for almost a third of the population by 2050 . Currently, eight million people, or 14 per cent of the UK population, are from ethnic minorities. But they now account for 80 per cent of population growth, while the white population remains constant. Experts from  think-tank Policy Exchange predict that as a result, by the middle of the century between 20 per cent and 30 per cent of the population – up to 16million people – will be from a minority community. In the last election, the Conservatives received 16 per cent of ethnic minority votes, while Labour had 68 per cent, according to the Ethnic Minority British Election Study which was undertaken by researchers from Oxford, Manchester and Essex Universities. Research by Ipsos Mori showed the Conservative share in 2010 had increased from the 2005 election when the party got just ten per cent of votes cast by ethnic minority voters. Conservative strategist Lynton Crosby told Conservative MPs they should look to Boris Johnson's  mayoral campaign, which won over large sections of the non-white community . In October, Conservative strategist Lynton Crosby said David Cameron needed to do more to win over voters from minority background. He told MPs they should look to Boris Johnson’s  mayoral campaign, which won over large sections of the non-white community. In a meeting at the Tory party conference, Crosby - who ran Johnson's 2012 campaign - said it had seen 'Boris outperform the Conservative party by 40% in the BME [black minority ethnic] communities'. But Dr Sobolewska said if voters from minority backgrounds were turning away from Labour, that did not necessarily mean they would give their support to the Conservatives - despite Tory attempts to win departing Labour voters over. 'They [the Conservatives] don't think for the effort they are putting in they are getting enough back - in fact they think what is going to happen to them is this so-called death by demographics that has been advertised as something that is already happening to the republicans in the US,' she said.","Labour has traditionally benefited from the ethnic minority vote .

"A new diet app will allow users to connect with a nutrition expert at the click of a button. Boston-based NuPlanit, which is expected to launch in spring 2015, rejects traditional calorie-counting, and instead gives  users a nutrition score when they log each meal. The idea is that users are more likely to successfully lose weight and improve overall health with a  scoring system  based on customized food group goals than by watching calorie intake. Scroll down for video . Health savvy: Instead of calorie counting, the app uses a customized Nutrition Score that highlights food groups . Founder and CEO Alaina Adams says she wants to shift the conversation from what you are eating to address the psychological reason why your food habits are they way they are. Ms Adams, who also has a PhD in mechanical engineering, was inspired to create NuPlanit in 2013 after her own struggles with a nutrition-related illness. 'I knew what I needed to do,' she told BostInno. 'I had a great care team, I was motivated, yet my stressful, busy life kept me going back to my old, comfortable, destructive habits. 'I found that I was more successful when I had regular check-ins with my dietitian, however I needed more support during my everyday life.' Ms Adams says in a company press release that simple dieting and calorie counting approaches fail 95 per cent of the time and current solutions for weight loss and management don't incorporate a nutrition expert even though research shows they they are proven to be an asset when trying to alter bad food habits. That's not all: The app provides users with food tracking logs, customized feedback, quality of life monitoring, automatic physical activity tracking and a 'smart' grocery shopping adviser with personalized meal planning, recipes and coupons. 'Each person has unique nutrient needs for optimal health so we developed a nutrition scoring algorithm, personalized to each individual's daily needs,' she explains. Simple solution: Founder and CEO Alaina Adams's personal nutrition struggles inspired her to create NuPlanit . 'We then use behavior change methodologies to deliver targeted feedback, recommendations and support to help people improve their Nutrition Score, their quality of life and ultimately their physical health.' After logging in their meals, users are given automatic feedback and reminders on how to improve their Nutrition Score, which is rated from 0-100 throughout the day. NuPlanit will be free for users to download, but features including video counseling sessions with an expert will require a monthly subscription, though fees are yet to be announced. If users are struggling between options or tempted to binge, they can click a 'Nutrition Lifeline' button, which puts customers in touch with either their current dietitian or one of the network's experts (chosen based on location, health insurance carrier and needs). While you aren't required to seek the advice of an expert, NuPlanit encourages customers to utilize human interaction as a way to identify and eradicate negative eating patterns. According the NuPlanit website, the average person makes more than 200 food-related decisions a day, which can make healthy eating seem overwhelming at times. NuPlanit also offers text and video counseling, quality of life monitoring, automatic physical activity tracking and a 'smart' grocery shopping adviser with personalized meal planning, recipes and coupons. The startup, which is currently in beta, launched a crowdfunding campaign in late November on Indiegogo with a goal of raising $50,000 by January 13 in order to enhance the product and grow its network of nutrition experts.","NuPlanit founder Alaina Adams was inspired to create the app because she found it easier to kick bad habits when she was working with her dietitian .

"An Amy Winehouse impersonator  has revealed she has 'a hunch' she may be the late singer's secret half sister. Laura Jane Butler, who was adopted at birth, is the only amateur singer to have received the endorsement of Miss Winehouse's parents as an impersonator since the star's death in 2011. The 43-year-old, who claims she is so similar to the tragic star that her father struggles to watch her perform, has now said she believes that they may in fact be related. Scroll down for video . Laura Jane Butler (left) says she has a hunch she may be related to Amy Winehouse as the pair have an 'uncanny' similarity. The star died in 2011 following a lengthy battle with alcoholism and drug abuse . Her claims have been refuted by Mitch Winehouse, whose agent dismissed them as 'rubbish', and the woman admits she has no evidence to suggest she is his daughter, other than the fact she knows little about her biological father. 'My likeness to her is uncanny. We also have similar mannerisms and similar personalities,' Ms Butler told the Daily Star. 'Mitch gets freaked out by my Amy tributes because I am so like Amy.' The singer, whose adoptive father recently died, is in contact with her birth mother but knows nothing of her biological father, she said. While she claims she may be closer to related to the Winehouse family in some way, she does not want to upset them by pursuing her hunch. 'It would just be a freak if Mitch was my father. I wouldn't want to rock anything as I am good friends with Mitch and Janis,' Ms Butler added. The 43-year-old tribute singer says she is friends with Miss Winehouse's parents Mitch and Janis. The singer's father (left with Ms Butler and right, with his daughter) has rubbished her claims . Mitch and Janis Winehouse were guests at the performer's wedding and have attended several of her tribute gigs across London. She has been performing as an impersonator of the star for seven years. Amy Winehouse was found dead in her north London home in June 2011 following a lengthy battle with drug and alcohol addiction. The cause of the 27-year-old's death was given as alcohol poisoning at a second inquest, where it was heard the star had been watching videos of herself on YouTube and drinking vodka in her final hours. Since her death her family has set up the Amy Winehouse Foundation, a charity which encourages recovering drug addicts and alcohols to share their experiences with young people in schools. Earlier this year the taxi driver and singer revealed he spent time in the Camden flat where his daughter was found slumped on her bed. 'This is the first place Amy bought when she got some money after her album Frank in 2004, and she lived here on and off for four years,' the 63-year-old said. 'When she was struggling for money before her Back To Black album in 2006 she said, ""Never sell the flat. I’m going to do a big album and we’re going to make lots of money."" 'So obviously my ex-wife Janis, who co-owns it, and I will never sell it.' Tributes left outside the singer's home in Camden, north London, following her untimely death in 2011 .

"Announcement: Anton Krasovsky, 37, was sacked from his job for admitting he was gay on live television . A Russian television presenter was sacked after coming out on live television. Anton Krasovsky, 37, made the announcement on the KontrTV network, a Kremlin-backed Internet and cable television network he helped to launch. 'I’m gay, and I’m just the same person as you, my dear audience, as President Putin, as Prime Minister Medvedev and the deputies of our Duma,' Mr Krasovsky said. He told CNN in a recent interview that he was sacked the same night that he made the announcement at the end of the Friday night show. It appeared that videos of his announcement in earlier this year were deleted from the Kontr TV website and YouTube. He told the interviewer he was not sure who was behind the decision to delete the footage. Mr Krasovsky, who was an editor-in-chief at the channel later told The Independent:  'I have made a lot of money in television and I understood that I’d lose everything,' he recalls over coffee, months later. He is currently unemployed. 'But I also understood that I couldn’t do anything else. I didn’t do it so that I would get hundreds of likes on my Facebook page. I did it because I wanted them to hear it in the Kremlin. And they heard it, and were surprised.' The issue of homosexuality in Russia is under intense scrutiny at the moment - yesterday FIFA has asked authorities in 2018 World Cup host Russia for 'clarification and more details' about a new anti-gay law, joining the International Olympic Committee in seeking answers from Moscow.Legislation prohibiting 'propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations among minors' has provoked an international furor since President Vladimir Putin signed it off in June and sparked growing concern at the IOC ahead of the Sochi Winter Games next February.

Sacked: He told CNN in a recent interview that he was sacked the same night that he made the announcement at the end of the Friday night show . Russian lawmakers say the law doesn't . outlaw homosexuality but merely discourages discussion of it among . people younger than 18. 'I'm gay, and I'm just the same person as you, my dear audience, as President Putin,' Mr Krasovsky said . However, the law has outraged Russian liberals . and some sectors of the international community just six months before . the start of the Winter Olympic Games in the Russian city of Sochi. The law does not outlaw gay sex, which was legalized in Russia in 1993. It does not explicitly ban . participation in gay pride parades or promotion of lesbian, gay, . bisexual and transgender equality online, but anyone wearing a rainbow . flag on the street or writing about gay relationships on Facebook, for . instance, could be accused of propagandizing. No one has yet gone to court under . the federal law. Six LGBT activists were detained after one of them . unfurled a banner reading 'Being gay is normal' near a children's . library in Moscow, but so far the participants have not been brought to . trial. Four Dutch citizens working on a . documentary film about gay rights in the northern Russian town of . Murmansk were the first foreigners to be detained under the new law. They were fined and forced to leave the country, but weren't put on . trial. There have been six cases in which individuals have been tried for 'propaganda' under regional legislation.

"Comedian Ted Shiress, 27 (pictured), from Roath, Cardiff, claims he was turned away twice from Empire restaurant in Cardiff city centre by staff . An Indian restaurant has been forced to apologise after turning away a cerebral palsy sufferer on two occasions and telling him he needed to be 'accompanied by an adult'. Ted Shiress, 27, from Roath, Cardiff, claims he was turned away twice from Empire restaurant in Cardiff city centre by staff. Writing about his experience on his blog, the comedian said he was left feeling 'shocked and hurt' after being flatly refused a table and said it was 'just not acceptable'. Mujib Mohammed, who owns the restaurant, has now apologised for the incident and said actions by one member of staff were 'completely inappropriate but stemmed from a lack of awareness' rather than an intention to discriminate. Mr Shiress, a former finalist of the Welsh Unsigned Stand-Up Award, said he tried to visit the Indian restaurant several times last week. He said the first time he attempted to eat at the restaurant he was told 'We're full, go please,' despite there being 'visibly empty tables'. He said he returned two days later to book a table for a future visit but was told to 'come in with a caretaker'. However, he said that despite the comment, he decided to return 48 hours later with his mother and was told once again that the restaurant was 'full'. Writing on his blog, he said: 'At this point I could sense my mother losing her rag as she popped out to remind the waiter I had booked. 'The sight of my mother then pleased the waiter as he said: ""Oh good, you have a responsible adult this time"". 'Reasonably my mother then inquired what this meant, explaining that she may be my mother but she's also my guest who lives in London and does not look after me. 'He clearly failed to process this information as he went on to insist ""He"" (yes, ""he""!!) ""needs a caretaker, what if he had an accident?(sic)"". 'Although she then tried suggesting anyone could have an accident, I had had enough at this point and insisted we go.' Mr Mohammed responded to Mr Shiress' comments via his blog, saying he was 'extremely disappointed' by the incident. He said all staff at the eatery would now be given disability awareness training. 'We wish to offer Ted a full and frank apology for what happened,' he said. Mujib Mohammed, who owns Empire restaurant (pictured), has now apologised for the incident and said actions by one member of staff were 'completely inappropriate but stemmed from a lack of awareness' The cerebral palsy sufferer  said he was left feeling 'shocked and hurt' after his treatment by the restaurant . 'Having read his blog we immediately undertook an internal investigation and our findings showed that the actions of one of our members of staff were completely inappropriate, but stemmed from a lack of understanding and awareness of disability rather than an active attempt to discriminate. 'To this end we will be arranging for our entire restaurant team to undergo disability awareness training at the earliest opportunity in the new year.' He added: 'We would welcome the opportunity to apologise to you in person, but in the meantime we sincerely and publicly apologise for any upset caused and would like to reassure you that this kind of occurrence will never happen again.' Mr Shiress has played some of the leading venues on the comedy circuit, including The Glee Clubs in Cardiff and Birmingham, as well as major festivals such as Green Man in Brecon. He said as a comedian he has a thick skin but had still felt hurt by the treatment. 'I can only imagine how it would hurt someone more sensitive,' he said. 'I'm pleased at what he said but it's the manager I feel should apologise.'","Ted Shiress, 27,  claims he was turned away twice from Empire in Cardiff .

"They're a great British tradition sure to make any Christmas dinner go with a bang - and as these vibrant images show, the humble Christmas cracker has always been an important part of the festive season. These beautifully illustrated cracker boxes provide a stunning visual history of British social and political developments over an entire century. The colourful images, dating back more than 100 years, document iconic moments and eras in history with many of the striking designs coming from the man credited with inventing the cracker himself - Tom Smith. Scroll down for video . A great British tradition to make sure to make any Christmas dinner goes with a bang - cracker inventor Tom Smith's Motoring Crackers features a family on a drive in their veteran motor car in 1907 . The colourful images, dating back more than 100 years, having striking designs such as Tom Smith's Pre-historic Crackers, from 1907, which feature a family of cavemen dressed in furs pulling a giant cracker . Tom Smith's Frolicsome Frogs, also from 1907, showed two frogs tugging on a cracker with the box promising to contain prizes such as miniature frogs, croakers, squeakers and riddles . St George's Crackers: The beautifully designed box features patron saint of England famously slaying the dragon in a design surrounded by red and white roses . An original set of Tom Smith’s 'Bank of Love' Christmas crackers, featuring a woman's face set against a butterfly design on the blue and red crackers which are edged in lace, currently on display at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London . But the boxes also allow a glimpse into how Christmas was celebrated in days gone by. Tom, a confectioner's apprentice was on a trip to Paris in 1840 when he saw some almond bon bons wrapped in tissue paper with a twist at each end. He worked on introducing something similar to the people of London and for seven years he developed the idea. He added mottoes and poems inside each one and the cracking mechanism - inspired by listening to the crackle of a log fire - was a strip of paper impregnated with chemicals which, when rubbed, created enough friction to produce a noise. His sons, Tom, Walter and Henry took over the business when he died and it was Walter who introduced the paper hats and toured the world to find unusual gifts to put inside. The company was very aware of current affairs and created many sets of crackers to mark occasions such as the Russo-Japanese War crackers, printed in 1907 (pictured) just after the Russian and Japanese military conflict ended . Tom Smith's Christmas Tree Crackers: Revealing a glimpse into how Christmas was celebrated in the past the box shows children dancing round a Christmas tree to music .

Tom Smith's Xmas Messengers, 1907: Another striking design from the man credited with inventing the cracker, robins are pictured delivering boxes of the famous crackers . The company was very aware of current affairs and as these vibrant images show, they created many sets of crackers to mark occasions. Among those pictured are the Russo-Japanese War crackers, printed in 1907, just after the Russian and Japanese military conflict ended. Also featured are the Motoring crackers printed in 1907 and the Telephone crackers designed in 1878 - two years after the man who invented the telephone, Alexander Graham Bell, was first granted a patent for the phone in 1876. Contents were tailored to each box with grotesque or artistic masks, puzzles, conundrums, tiny treasures, jewels, games and mottoes. Most of the beautifully illustrated boxes, crackers and hats were made by hand and the company still produces crackers today. Another British company strongly associated with the cracker business is Batger and Co. Tom Smith, the inventor of the Christmas cracker . Tom Smith had been a young confectioner's apprentice when he first had the idea for the Christmas cracker,an invention which would go onto become an integral part of the British festive season. On a trip to Paris in 1840 he had been inspired by some almond bon bons wrapped in tissue paper with a twist at each end. It was a simple idea which, over the next seven years, would eventually evolve into the cracker. He brought over the bon bon to London as part of his wedding cake ornament and confectionery business. It proved a big hit at Christmas and then in January, Smith decided to add a small love motto in the tissue paper to improve sales. But it was the breakthrough of adding the cracker's iconic snap, inspired by the crackle of a log as he threw it on his fire, that eventually led to the crackers we know today. Smith discovered that a strip of paper impregnated with chemicals, when rubbed, created enough friction to produce a noise which delighted his customers. In 1847, he dropped the name of bon bon and called his new crackers Cosaques, but he kept the motto and added a surprise gift. The crackers became an overnight success and at the turn of the century, Tom Smith produced crackers not only for the Christmas season but also to celebrate every major occasion from The Paris Exhibition in 1900 to War Heroes in 1918 and the Russian Japanese conflict in 1907. Smith toured the world to find unusual and precious trinkets for his crackers, which were tailored to each box such as artistic masks, puzzles and games. When he died he left the business to his three sons, Tom Henry and Walter. The company have also been making crackers for the royals for over a hundred years. Tom Smith also had a range of crackers marking Asian culture in 1907 such as the Jewels of Asia Japanese (pictured) which shows a woman choosing a necklace with the help of two young girls, and a box of Tom Smith's crackers . Tom Smith's Japanese Toys, 1907 has a playful design which features two children in Japan who abandon their toys to chase a monkey who has stolen a cracker . Another British company strongly associated with the cracker business is Batger and Co such as Batgers Treasure Trove crackers with a picture showing pirates hiding their ill gotten gains in a cave . Batgers Royal Highlanders Crackers showing a parade of smartly turned out soldiers in kilts and bearskins marching through Edinburgh . Batgers Forfeit Crackers: Showing a jolly party game at home at the dinner table with a family wearing party hats playing forfeits . Like Tom Smith, they sold a wide variety of crackers in highly decorated boxes and once again many were themed or in commemoration of a special event. Featured in this collection is the Wireless Crackers set which shows Santa wearing headphones and taking a call from a little girl in bed. This label was printed in the 1930s during the early days of radio. Another box called Television Crackers shows a family watching a television set, with children using the crackers to scare their elderly relatives. This label was printed in 1950 during the early days of television. Crackers were an incredibly expensive luxury at the time costing from 14 shillings to 30 shillings a box. The bright and jolly label for a Batger's Derby Crackers, which states 'The name Batger is a guarantee of value', is based around the theme of the horse racing Derby . Another cracker company, Mead and Field's Marionette Crackers, showing a girl in a party costume working various puppets in the shape of race horses and crackers . Cabaret Girl from the Peerless series of Christmas crackers, from 1933, which promises that each cracker contains 'both a juvenile costume and fancy hat or cap, amusing joke or riddle, a good snap' Batger's Gretna Green Crackers themed around the destination for eloping lovers features a couple from the Regency period in the traditional blacksmiths forge at Gretna Green . Batger's Musical Toy cracker box label from the 1920s featuring a picture of a group of children playing musical instruments . This rather odd scene featuring an adult in a sinister party mask trying to lasso a group of children in fancy dress masks and head dresses at a party is from Batger's Masks and Animal Luggage .

Chinese health authorities were forced to act following public anger that erupted over pictures taken in an operating room showing a group of medical staff posing for photos while an unconscious patient lies beside them. The photos were taken in August at the privately owned Fengcheng Hospital in the north-central city of Xi'an and leaked on social media at the weekend. The group of medical staff pose for a photo at the completion of an operation at Fengcheng Hospital, China . The pictures appear to show three surgeons continuing to work on the patient while a group of medical staff face the camera as a group. Other images show some of the team flashing the 'V for victory' sign and grinning, and in one instance, the patient can be clearly seen. The hospital's director, deputy director, the head nurse and chief of anesthetics were all fired, along with the staff members pictured, The Telegraph reported. Online commentators criticized medical staff for being unprofessional and disrespectful of patients, while others defended the photos, saying they were intended to be private and were taken at the end of surgical procedures. Tensions have run high between health workers and patients in China in recent years. Patients often complain about poor medical services and high costs, especially the need to bribe doctors and nurses in exchange for competent services. In this photo, the patient can be seen lying unconscious on the operating table as staff pose for the picture . Here the team are pictured as they all face the camera as a group. Chinese health authorities later said the group took the photo to memorialize the operating room, which was being relocated . Several members of the medical team flash 'V for victory' hand signs in the final picture leaked on social media at the weekend . Chinese health workers say they are overworked, underpaid and underappreciated. The Xi'an Bureau of Public Health, which handed out the punishment, said in a statement Sunday that the staff at Fengcheng took the photos to memorialize the operating room, which was to be relocated. Nevertheless, the bureau said the picture-snapping violated proper medical procedures and had a negative social impact. It also demanded that the hospital issue an open apology and rectify its management to avoid similar incidents in the future.","Hospital bosses and medical staff fired after surgeons pose for selfies .

"Fears have risen about a measles outbreak in Perth after two people returned there from Bali with the disease. The revelation sparked a warning that hundreds of people could have been exposed to the virus on the flight or at various locations around the city. The pair contracted the disease while holidaying with their family on the island. They were already sick with the virus when they travelled on Air Asia flight QZ 548 from Denpasar to Perth on December 20. There is now a possibility that passengers who were on the flight may be at risk of developing the disease. Scroll down for video . Three cases of measles being contracted by West Australians in Bali were reported in the last few weeks . ABC reported that Western Australia's Communicable Disease Control medical coordinator Paul Effler said if anyone thought they were in those areas at the time and developed a fever with other symptoms including a cough, runny nose or sore red eyes within the next two weeks, they should stay at home and consult their doctor. Anyone with the symptoms should call ahead to a hospital and mention their possible contact with measles so they could be isolated when they arrived at the GP surgery or emergency department. 43 West Australians having been diagnosed with the virus this year, which is a record. There has now been a total of three cases of measles being contracted by West Australians in Bali in the last few weeks. Measles is contagious for up to five days before a rash develops and four days after that. Measle symptoms include a cough, runny nose or sore red eyes . 'If you're susceptible or you're in the same area as someone as a measles case you will get it,' Dr Effler said. 'The good news is most people in Western Australia are immune to measles.

"An untouched and unbound rare first edition of Jane Austen's Emma is on sale at a collectors bookshop for almost £100,000. The book is unique because it is in almost pristine condition and was found with the paper boards it would have had before being sent to the binder to bound in leather. However the novel, which comes in three volumes, escaped the binder and is in almost mint condition. Three volumes of a first edition of Jane Austen's Emma, unbound, are being sold for almost £100,000 . It is priced at £97,500 and is being sold at Lucius Books in Fossgate in York by owner James Hallgate. It is understood to be the first time the book has been sold. Mr Hallgate said: 'This is probably the best copy in the world; it's in entirely original condition still with the paper boards. 'Back in those days a customer would buy the book and send it to their binder to be bound in leather. This copy escaped the binder. 'It's my favourite piece in the catalogue as it has lasted nearly 200 years in untouched, original condition. There isn't a single one in the world that will look like that. The rare unbound first edition copy of Jane Austen's Emma is not the first to be sold for such a high price . 'While copies of Emma in the original boards do appear infrequently, beautiful examples in this entirely untouched condition are of great rarity.' The book was discovered in a castle in Scotland and has an inscription of Lady M Dalrymple, who is believed to have been its owner.

"Millions of shoppers will be spending Christmas Eve pounding the streets for last-minute gifts with more than £800million predicted to go through the tills. Half of British adults have left some of their festive shopping until today, according to a survey. Sainsbury’s Bank, for whom the poll was done, has estimated 11 per cent of the week’s shopping will take place in the final hours of trading - down from 22 per cent last year. But 23.6million people are expected to shop today compared with 17.5million last year, spending up to £832million.

"It has all the usual suspects of Christmas dinner, with turkey, honey roast ham, stuffing, cranberry jelly and even Brussels sprouts. But this festive spread is served up in 1.5lb giant toastie.

Three pigs in blankets and cheesy turkey gravy, sandwiched between the two toasties before being fused together on the griddle, complete the creation, . The Yuletide sarnie is the brainchild of Flic and Barny Luxmoore, from Leamington Spa. The couple, who run The Jabberwocky, a gourmet street food service which specialises in toasties, have called the 1.5lbs festive feast Mrs Claus and have put it on sale for £8.50. Their festive menu also features a mince pie toastie, made with homemade mincemeat and a scoop of brandy butter, and a turkey toastie with cranberry sauce and Camembert. The toastie is made from two sandwiches fused together with cheesy turkey gravy . The pair - who have been creating Christmas themed toasties since 2012  - have become renowned for their seasonal toasties, even winning the BBC Midlands Street Food Award in 2013 for their very British culinary flare. Mrs Luxmoore 30, said: 'We've had a great response from customers to the Mrs Claus toasty. 'People use it as an ersatz Christmas dinner, and just love the idea of a whole Christmas dinner - in weight as well as in content - in a single toasty. 'The most common response is a widening of the eyes as we put it together and they realise how much they have let themselves in for. 'But invariably they come back after and tell us it was amazing.' The festive menu also features a mince pie toastie and a turkey toastie with cranberry sauce and Camembert . For those put off by sprouts, the couple are offering customers the chance to remove the Brussels in return for a charity condition of £1, dubbing the option as the 'Mrs Claus clause'. Surprisingly, they have only had one request to remove the green wintry veg, regularly selling out their entire stock of Mrs Claus toasties with sprouts included. Mr Luxmoore said: 'We are constantly asked if we can add or subtract ingredients here and there, often making a totally different toasty. 'Before Christmas, we had a horrible premonition that we would spend the entire time taking sprouts out of the Mrs Claus. Mrs Luxmoore (left) preparing the festive feast in a sandwich. Customers who want their toasties sans sprouts have to make a £1 donation to charity (right) 'We thought we would at least give people an incentive to try it, seeing as they actually really work. 'Although we have had donations where people have left the sprouts in, only one person has paid to take them out, which perhaps suggest people like sprouts more than we thought.

"Sometimes you can try and disguise but you can't hide, as this new mugshot shows. Codi James Antoniello, 19, from Holland Township in Michigan was chased by police last Thursday after allegedly attacking a 21-year-old man with a pickax and baseball bat. In a bid to escape, he quickly tried to alter his appearance by shaving his head. However, he was caught mid-transformation and a booking photo shows him with a large bald strip running through his brown locks. In a bid to escape arrest Codi James Antoniello, 19, from Holland Township in Michigan quickly tried to alter his appearance by shaving his head . Antoniello was arraigned Friday on charges of felonious assault and first-degree home invasion along with a 16-year-old accomplice. A spokesperson from the Ottawa County Sheriff’s Office told Wood TV the two teenagers broke into a man's home around 2:30am last Wednesday and bludgeoned him. The victim’s father called 911 after trying to break up the fight. It's believed the attack stemmed around a woman and Antoniello is dating the victim's ex-girlfriend. All of the parties involved had reportedly been communicating via Facebook before coming to blows. The victim sustained injuries to his head and face and was taken to the hospital where he was listed in good condition. Antoniello and the other alleged attacker fled the scene but detectives caught up with them a day later at an apartment complex. Police told Fox News that Antoniello was apprehended while he was in the process of shaving his head to change his look. Antoniello is being held at the Ottawa County jail while the 16-year-old is lodged at a  juvenile detention center. Both men face the same charges.","Codi James Antoniello, 19, from  Michigan was chased by police last Thursday after allegedly attacking a 21-year-old man .

"A cash-strapped student is pleading for the safe return of his beloved vintage car after it was stolen from outside his house – and is offering a reward of 'love and affection' to anyone who finds it. Ben Wheldon-Bayes, 20, said he was devastated when he popped outside to get something from his 30-year-old brown B-reg Austin Mini only to find it had been stolen. The civil engineering student had driven home from Southampton University for Christmas and parked the motor - nicknamed Edna - outside his family home in Reading, Berkshire. Ben Wheldon-Bayes, 20, parked his 30-year-old brown B-reg Austin Mini (pictured) outside his family home in Reading, Berkshire, on Saturday but noticed it had vanished when he went to unpack it just a few hours later .

He is now pleading for any information about its whereabouts and will offer 'love and affection' He said he noticed his beloved car had disappeared when he went to unload it on Saturday evening. He is now desperate to see his car returned, and said that while he cannot offer a cash reward, he will 'shower love and affection' on anyone who can help. His Facebook post appealing for his car's return has already been shared more than 16,000 times around the country. It says: 'My car has been stolen from outside my house in Reading some time between 6.30pm and 2am last night (Saturday). 'Any info etc. would be greatly appreciated, can't really offer a reward but I'll shower you with love and affection. 'Someone please give my car back, it's Christmas.' Speaking at his parent's large red-brick home today, the third year student said the car was his 'pride and joy'. Mr Wheldon-Bayes, 20 (above), saved up for years for the vintage car and said he is 'devastated' that it has been taken. He hopes it will be safely returned . 'I saved up for years for the car,' he said. 'All my birthday money, Christmas money, and I had a job in Asda. 'It was my pride and joy and I was so happy driving it.' Mr Wheldon-Bayes had owned the vintage brown Mini for three years, and it was his first car after passing his test. The penniless student said that while he would be unable to offer anyone a financial reward for the safe return of his car, he would do anything he could to thank them. He said: 'I would be overjoyed. I don't know what I'd do. I'd be shocked if I got it back. 'It would be incredible to have it back. It is my favourite thing in the world at the moment.' Of the online support, he said: 'It's wicked, it's lovely. So many people have messaged me. 'More than 16,000 people have shared my Facebook post, and that's strangers, people I don't even have mutual friends with. 'Loads of people have contacted me and suggested things that might have happened.' He believes thieves took the car and may have sold it on for parts since there's a huge market for the older models. He had only recently saved up enough money to insure the car again after having it in storage for two years, but was in the process of sorting out special classic car coverage when it was taken. 'I don't think I'll get a penny,' he said. His father John, 71, said he worked hard to get the car and appealed to anyone with information to contact the family.

"A tattooed princess preserved in permafrost after 2,500 years is to be reinterred amid fears her upheaval sparked a series of natural disasters. The mummified remains of the Russian ice maiden were discovered 21 years ago in a high altitude plateau in the heart of south-western Siberia. But her removal led to concern among local elders who called for her to be put back in her final resting place to 'stop her anger that caused floods and earthquakes'. Scroll down for video . The tattooed Russian ice maiden was discovered 21 years ago in a high altitude plateau in the heart of south-western Siberia . When the mummy was found by scientist Natalia Polosmak in 1993 she was heralded as 'one of the most significant archaeological discoveries of the 20th century' She was thought to be about 25 years old when she died of suspected cancer and was found preserved in permafrost . Ancient beliefs dictate that her presence in the burial chamber had been to 'bar the entrance to the kingdom of the dead'. Now the Siberian Times  has reported plans have finally been put forward to reinter the body back into the ground in the Russia's Altai Mountains and honour her with her own special mausoleum. Located on the pristine grasslands of the 2,500 metre high Ukok Plateau, the beautiful monument to Princess Ukok could be started next year. The tattooed mummy was excavated by Novosibirsk scientist Natalia Polosmak in 1993 and was heralded as 'one of the most significant archaeological discoveries of the 20th century'. Thought to be about 25 years old when she died of suspected cancer, she was found preserved in permafrost, with two men also discovered nearby. Buried around her were six horses, saddled and bridled and said to have been her spiritual escorts to the next world, along with a meal of sheep and horse meat. Archaeologists also found ornaments made from felt, wood, bronze and gold as well as a small container of cannabis and a stone plate on which coriander seeds were burned. From her clothes and possessions including a 'cosmetics bag', scientists were able to recreate her fashion and beauty secrets. She was dressed in a long shirt made from Chinese silk, and had long felt sleeve boots with a beautiful decoration on them. At this time Chinese silk was only ever found in royal burials of the Pazyrk people, and since it was more expensive than gold it gave an indication of her wealth and status. Elders in the Altai Mountains have long called for the mummified remains to be reburied on the Ukopk plateau . Elders insisted that the worst flooding in 50 years in Altai and a series of earthquakes were caused by the dead princess . Her head was completely shaved, and she wore a horse hair wig on top of which was a carving of a wooden deer. The princess's face and neck skin was not preserved, but the skin of her left arm survived. But the most exciting discovery was her elaborate body art, which many observers said bore striking similarities to modern-day tattoos. On her left shoulder was a fantastical mythological animal made up of a deer with a griffon's beak and a Capricorn~s antlers. The antlers themselves were decorated with the heads of griffons. The mouth of a spotted panther with a long tail could also be seen, and she had a deer's head on her wrist. Elders in the Altai Mountains have long called for the mummified remains to be reburied on the Ukopk plateau to 'stop her anger which causes floods and earthquakes'. They insisted that the worst flooding in 50 years in Altai and a series of earthquakes were caused by the dead princess. Recently Russian scientists discovered that her death is likely to have been caused by cancer but that she also suffered a suspected fall from a horse late in her life. She is believed to have been between 25 and 28 years old and about 1.62 metres tall. Her remains were treated by the same scientists in Moscow who preserved the body of former Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin. The plans to reinter the body back into the ground in the Russia's Altai Mountains and honour her with her own special mausoleum. Work could start on the 2,500 metre high Ukok Plateau next year . Princess Ukok spent most of the past two decades at a scientific institute in Novosibirsk. Then she was moved to a specially designed chamber at the Republican National Museum in Gorno-Altaisk, but elders objected to her remains going on public display. The first sketches of the plans for the new mausoleum were presented by Akai Kine, the zaisan (leader) of the Teles ethnic group, and president of the Spiritual Centre of the Turks Kin Altai. He told the Siberian Times: 'According to the drafts, the mummy will be put in her original resting place, and on the top will be build funerary monument. 'The mausoleum will be located on the Ukok plateau in the place where the mummy was found by archaeologists in 1993. 'These are the first options for the future mausoleum. Publishing them, we want to start a public discussion in the media. 'There is no State decision on reburial of the Princess. But we have the main thing - we believe that this revered woman will be reburied.' Local political leaders accept that she should be reburied. Under the proposals put forward for the mausoleum the elders say any project should meet three basic requirements. Akai Kine said: 'Firstly, the body should be reposed in the site of the original burial. 'Second, the mausoleum mound must be made according to the traditions that were followed when the Princess was buried. 'And third, scientists shall be granted access to the body.'","The tattooed mummy was excavated in 1993 by scientist Natalie Polosmak .

"They're among the most iconic artifacts of British culture, recognised the world over by their bright red exterior. But the quintessential red phone box is being reinvented to accommodate a generation of mobile-phone users. Instead of metal headsets and coin slots, the booths are to be fitted with coffee machines, sweet jars and shoe shine as part of the scheme. Phone boxes across London are to be refurbished in to coffee shops by the Red Kiosk Company. It comes after the success of Red Box coffee in Brighton (pictured) Of the 669 remaining K6 Kiosks, 100 will be adapted by the Red Kiosk Company. For £5,000-a-pop, the company will transform them into miniature businesses and give jobs to the long-term unemployed. The 100 Kiosks have been taken on via the BT Adopt a Phonebox scheme. For as little as £1, local authorities and charities can take ownership of one of the iconic boxes and protect its heritage. If the new owner decides to fit a defibrillator in their kiosk, BT will supply free red paint for them to coat its exterior. Scotland's smallest internet cafe can be found in Ballogie where visitors can make themselves a cup of tea or coffee and use the internet . Heather Munro with the defibrillator outside the phone box in Glendaruel, Argyll, in 2011 . Twelve of its planning applications for Kiosks have already been approved, the Evening Standard reports. The scheme has already seen success in Brighton, where two previously disused phone boxes have been turned into Red Box Coffee and Ice Cream shops. And in Scotland a council took ownership of one of the boxes to create the country's smallest internet cafe. Visitors to the box in Ballogie, Aberdeenshire, can make themselves a cup of tea or coffee while connecting to the internet. An honesty box has been placed to encourage customers to pay for the service. In Argyll a previously empty box was fitted with a defibrillator upon the suggestion of a local girl guide. Heather Munro won a local competition appealing for the best use of the box in 2011. Its location in the Highlands is a passing point for many hikers who have, villagers said, had heart problems in the past. In 1868, the Telegraph Act granted the Postmaster General (the office of the General Post Office) the right to acquire privately-owned telegraph companies. Sixteen years later, the first public boxes appeared on British streets, with the first police box appearing in Glasgow in 1891. In 1923, a national competition was held to source a new design for the kiosks across London. It was held by the Metropolitan Boroughs Joint Standing Committee. After several different styles of kiosk, 8,000 of the K6 were distributed across the UK in 1936. But in 1969, the Metropolitan Police began decommissioning its network of police boxes. A decade later, the Post Office - which had acquired the boxes - is split into two companies, and they become the responsibility of BT. With the introduction of mobile phones, the use of public phone boxes deteriorated rapidly over the following decades. In 2008, British Telecommunications launched the Adopt a Kiosk scheme to revive the disused boxes. By 2011, 1500 kiosks had been adopted under the scheme. The following year it was revealed that of the 50,000-odd public phones in the UK, only around 11,000 were red boxes. A 2001 phone box unveiled in Parliament Square as BT announced a loss of £1.35billion .","The Red Kiosk Company has 'adopted' 100 of the iconic phone booths .

"This was the scene when more than £1.25million in cash spilled out of an armoured van in Hong Kong - sparking a frenzy as passers-by tried to get their hands on the notes. Traffic ground to a halt on busy Gloucester Road in central Hong Kong as taxi drivers rushed out of their cars to make a grab for the hundreds of banknotes scattered over the busy multi-lane highway.

This was the scene when more than £1.25million in cash spilled out of an armoured van in Hong Kong - sparking a frenzy as passers-by tried to get their hands on the notes . Police, some of them armed with armed with shotguns, helmets and bulletproof vests, rushed to the scene to secure the area. More than HK$15.23million (£1.26million) spilled onto the road after the vehicle crashed, police said. It was not clear how much officers managed to retrieve and how much had been pocketed by members of the public. 'Any person who finds the relevant bank notes should return them to police as soon as possible, or they may be committing a theft,' police warned in a statement. Television footage showed pedestrians dashing in from the pavements to join in the Christmas Eve melee . Police superintendent Wan Siu-hung said the driver of the van made it all the way to his destination, a half-hour's drive away, oblivious to the fact that his back door was open and the cash boxes had fallen out. 'When it (the van) arrived at its destination they discovered that the door was open,' Wan told reporters, adding that police would use the serial numbers of the bills to conduct an investigation. Legal experts told local media that people who kept the banknotes would be committing larceny and could face up to 10 years in jail.","Traffic ground to a halt in central Hong Kong after cash spilled out of van .

"A suspected burglar who died in police custody after being Tasered while breaking into a family home has been named. Adrian Thompson became unresponsive after being shot with a 50,000-volt stun gun following reports of a break-in at flats in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire. The 34-year-old later died in police custody following emergency treatment. An investigation into his death has been launched by the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Scroll down for video . Adrian Thompson, 34, died after being Tasered by police while breaking into a block of flats in Staffordshire . Mr McDonald's family have been too grief-stricken to speak of his death. The IPCC said today: 'The 34-year-old man was arrested and taken to a police van. 'The man then became unresponsive and an ambulance was called. He was pronounced dead at the scene at around 2.30 am. 'A post mortem was carried out and HM Coroner has been informed.' Commissioner Kathryn Stone OBE added: 'I would like to express my sincere condolences to the man’s family at this difficult time. 'We are at a very early stage of our independent investigation into the actions police took at the scene. 'We will be examining closely police involvement in this incident and the circumstances surrounding the man’s death.' Last month Matthew Williams, 34, died after being shot with a stun gun following a horrific attack on Cerys Yemm at a hostel for the homeless. Miss Yemm was allegedly murdered by Williams who ‘ate her face while high on cocaine’ in Caerphilly, South Wales. Police discharged the Taser after finding the 22-year-old unconscious with severe facial injuries. Solicitor Sophie Khan, from the Police Action Centre, has now called on Theresa May to consider a temporary ban on Tasers. She said stun guns are a ‘real threat to life and their use must now be curbed’. Yesterday officers remained on guard outside the flat, which neighbours say is occupied by a ‘hard-working’ couple in their twenties and their baby boy. Death: A man has died after being shot with a Taser stun gun by police at a home in Newcastle-under-Lyme . Investigation: The incident came after the man apparently tried to burgle a house . Police: Officers at the scene in the aftermath of the fatal Taser shooting in the early hours . Block: The attempted burglary and subsequent death happened at these flats in Newcastle-under-Lyme . On guard: A police officer at the scene with a Taser holstered on his jacket . Neighbour Mark Finney, 50, said: ‘I was asleep and at around 1.30am, I woke up and heard shouting and tremendous banging. It sounded like someone was in distress.’ A 22-year-old local resident, who did not want to be named, said he heard the Taser victim shout ‘help me’ after the stun gun was fired at around 1.45am. He added: ‘There were seven or eight police and I saw them dragging this bloke out. ‘He was still alive then but he looked like he was drunk or something. They were carrying him with their arms under his shoulders. They bunged him in the back of the van.’ Staffordshire Police, which deploys Tasers more than any other force in the country, has now been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which will investigate the death. Probe: The Independent Police Complaints Commission will be investigating the man's death . Quiet: The incident took place in the suburb of Chesterton just outside Newcastle-under-Lyme . An IPCC report revealed in July that Staffordshire officers had used Tasers as ‘a deterrent’ 619 times in the past nine years. Between 2012 and 2013, the force fired stun guns a total of 71 times – more than three times more than similar-sized forces such as Leicestershire and West Mercia Police. The weapons have been linked to at least ten deaths in England and Wales over the past decade. Staffordshire’s police and crime commissioner Matthew Ellis said it was ‘immensely sad’ that a man had lost his life, but added that it would be inappropriate to comment further during an ongoing IPCC investigation.

Beachgoers were recently asked to have their faces and skin filmed using an ultraviolet camera at Sydney's iconic Bondi Beach to show how sunscreen can act as a shield against the sun . The film was a collaboration between Nivea Sun and New York based film maker Thomas Leveritt. 'The emotions unleashed when people see themselves in ultraviolet are so interesting - the unselfconscious glee or surprise or fascination is almost like an undiscovered tribe seeing themselves in the mirror for the first time,' Mr Leveritt said. 'I expected Australians to be much more clued up about the sun than Americans or Brits, which they seem to be. 'But even here, being able actually to see the sun damage changed that message from an intellectual one to an emotional one.' This woman had her face filmed with the UV lens so she could see exactly how sun-affected her skin was .

Mr Lee said there were several tips to consider to be more sun safe this summer. 'People don't wear sunscreen if they find it uncomfortable - it can be too thick or greasy,' he said. 'I'd suggest funding one they do find comfortable and get the highest SPF available. 'You should be using about 35ml for your whole body in one application. That's 5ml for the seven body parts, including your face and neck, each limb and front and back.'

"Christopher Melendez,27, has defied the odds to become a pro wrestler after losing his leg in an IED explosion while serving with the US Army in Iraq . A heroic Iraq war veteran who lost his leg in an IED explosion has defied the odds to become a professional wrestler. Christopher Melendez, was only 23 days away from returning home when his left leg was ripped off in the blast and he was left fighting for his life. After being resuscitated three times  the Army Sergeant was flown back to the US where he underwent  surgery to his arm and jaw. His leg could not be saved. Now, eight years on the 27-year-old, has become a professional wrestler and has joined TNA Wrestling. 'Here in TNA, I plan to go straight to the top,' Mr Melendez, who grew up in Spanish Harlem, New York, told Mandatory.com. 'I have the same mentality I had in the battlefield, the same mentality I had during my recovery. I'm going to be the best.' Mr Melendez joined the army at 17 after being inspired by his father, who served in Vietnam. He spent three years in Iraq and was deployed to Afghanistan after signing up in 2004. But, less than a month before he was due to leave Iraq he was caught up in the explosion and lost his leg. Sergeant Melendez made his professional wrestling debut at the Manhattan Centre in August this year . During his debut fight Mr Melendez defeated DJZ and then Kenny KIng . Mr Melendez, pictured in his military uniform, was inspired to join the US Army by his father, who fought in Vietnam . 'When I was able to open my eyes after the explosion I looked across the battlefield to see what I thought was a fellow-soldier in need of help,' he said. 'I quickly realized it was my leg.' Melendez was treated at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas where he quickly recovered and was walking again, with the help of a prosthetic, within 40 days. Determined not to let the amputation slow him down, Melendez started training to become a professional wrestler in 2012 and was recently offered the contract with TNA. Early in his career Mr Melendez wore his lightweight prosthetic leg, but he has since ditched it in the ring, . 'Every time I have the leg off and I'm standing tall on one leg, that shows other guys, other amputees, civilians and veterans that you can overcome these things,' he told Mandatory.com .

"The U.S. federal government has prompted controversy after spending over $33,000 on a study to find out whether same-sex couples live closer to tobacco shops than heterosexuals. The large sum was spent on a study by the National Institutes of Health entitled, 'Relationship Between Tobacco Retailer Density and Sexual Minority Couples.' But it's likely to raise questions about how the government is spending money, particularly at a time when there are widespread economic problems. Smoking habits: The $33,341 report found that gay couples are more likely to smoke than heterosexuals . Joseph Lee, a graduate student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, lead the research. He interviewed gays, bisexuals, and lesbians at bars in West Virginia to see if they smoked, and  picked up cigarette butts outside of community colleges for his prior tobacco research. The report found that gay couples are more likely to smoke than heterosexuals. Spending bill: On Tuesday President Obama signed a $1.1 trillion spending bill passed by Congress . This was due to where they lived in the U.S. which tended to be in urban neighborhoods where there were more tobacco retailers. The report also found that 'Living near a tobacco retailer has been associated with decreased success in quitting tobacco. Tobacco use is substantially higher among sexual minorities than among heterosexuals. 'The reasons for this persistent disparity remain unclear, but the high toll of death and disability from tobacco use creates substantial health inequalities in cancer.' The $33,341 study was carried out using information from nearly 100,000 tobacco retailers in 97 U.S. counties with census data to find out whether same-sex couples lived nearby. The National Institutes of Health is a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human services. It describes itself as 'the nation’s leading medical research agency—making important discoveries that improve health and save lives.' Last week, President Obama signed a $1.1 trillion spending bill passed by Congress last week that lifted the threat of a government shutdown. The legislation funds most government agencies through September 2015.","The large sum was spent on a study by the National Institutes of Health .

"The remains of missing Darwin mother Carlie Sinclair have been found in a bush grave just days before what would have been her 37th birthday. The discovery was made by Northern Territory police's forensics team on Wednesday morning, five days after a grave was found in bushland on a private property in Berry Springs - about 60km south of Darwin. The remains are yet to be formally identified as Carlie's, but NT Police Commissioner John McRoberts said he had no doubt they were the missing woman's. The remains of Carlie Sinclair have been found just days before her 37th birthday (she is pictured here with her son, Alex) Carlie's mother and father, Marlene and Robert, and her brother Kristian flew to Darwin on Friday once they learned of the arrest of her partner, Danny Deacon, on suspicion of murder. Marlene Sinclair said it had been a long 18 months since Carlie's disappearance. Carlie went missing on June 18 last year from her business premises in Parap - north of the Northern Territory capital. 'She was such a lovely, joyous, kind person. To think something like this could happen to her is unbelievable,' she said. Carlie went missing on June 18 last year . Marlene also thanked the police for their tireless investigation. 'They kept us going when things were really down and black. Every single one of them has been so kind and just helped wherever they could,' she said tearfully. 'This is just amazing, the work they have done to get a resolution to this. It just simply is awesome.' Danny Deacon appeared in the Darwin Magistrates Court earlier on Wednesday charged with murder. He did not apply for bail and will front court again in February. Mr McRoberts said it would take some days before a full positive identification of the body can be made. 'Today is a sad day, not only because we have recovered the remains of a woman who we say was murdered, but today is in fact the anniversary of Carlie's birthday. Tomorrow she would have turned 37,' he said. Mr McRoberts also gave words of comfort to Ms Sinclair's family. 'We can only imagine the grief you have experienced over the past 18 months,' he said. '[We] hope that today's discovery gives you some comfort to understand what happened to your loving daughter and sister, Carlie.' NT police had assistance and support from Queensland police, Western Australian police, the Australian Federal Police and specialist advice from the FBI in the US 'because we would not leave any stone unturned', Mr McRoberts said.

"A family of car thieves stole dozens of 4x4s in the Midlands before dismantling the vehicles and selling off their parts to criminals in the Middle East. Within the gang were eight cousins who scoured the streets looking for Toyota and Vauxhall cars to steal and take apart at a rural industrial estate in Staffordshire. Once deconstructed, the vehicles' engines and gearboxes were sold to buyers in the United Arab Emirates. James Bailey (left), 36, and Rocky Butler (right) were jailed for five years and four months for their roles in the gang which sold the parts of stolen cars to buyers in the Middle East . Leslie Taylor (left) was jailed for four years. Yawar Jaffari, who took orders from buyers in the UAE, will spend three years and nine months behind bars . All of the cousins have been jailed alongside others involved in the illegal business for almost 30 years. Worcester Crown Court heard how the men, all from Blakenall in Walsall, attempted to steal 81 vehicles in the Midlands, before handing the parts over to Yawar Jaffari who, the court heard, had contacts in the UAE. Among the most coveted car-parts were 2L engines which were frequently requested by the gang's buyers. Toyota Hilux, Toyota Hiace, Toyota Landcruiser and Vauxhall Brava were named as the most sought after models. Once Jaffari received an order from abroad, the eight men would be told what to steal and dismantle for distribution, the court heard. The operation grew quickly, with the men forced to move to larger premises to keep up with the demand for Toyota and Vauxhall parts. Colin Brookes (left) was jailed for two years as was Richard Edwards (right, both from Walsall, Midlands . (Left to right) Terence Gould,  Paul Kendall and James Taylor who were all jailed following a lengthy investigation by West Mercia police . The men operated from three units at Cannock Wood Industrial Estate in Staffordshire (pictured) Among the cars most frequently stolen by the gang was the Toyota Hilux (file image above) Marking their routes out in daylight, they would peruse homes and offices at night to find the vehicles. The men, aged between 26 and 46, all received jail sentences for their role in the organisation, with the shortest being for two years. Each was ordered to pay a £120 victim surcharge. 'This was a lengthy and complex investigation into a large group of offenders,' said Detective Constable Karl High from West Mercia Police. 'A number of policing techniques were deployed to identify and prosecute the persons responsible. It is clear that this was organised criminality for commercial gain. 'Many of the victims have lost their vehicles including tools used in the course of their trades and professions, preventing them from working and further compounding the offences.

"Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said wants to hit better-off homeowners with the mansion tax in the next financial year . Labour has asked the Treasury to start drawing up plans to levy its mansion tax on 100,000 expensive homes from day one of regaining power. Despite a revolt from some Labour MPs over the annual levy, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said he aimed to hit better-off homeowners in the next financial year. Although it is unusual for a tax to be introduced in the course of a financial year, Mr Balls said he wanted to start raising money from the rich in order to plough it into the NHS as quickly as possible. He said Treasury officials were already working on the proposals, in line with the civil service practice of making plans to implement the policies of parties that could win a forthcoming election. Labour and Liberal Democrat plans for a mansion tax had been in doubt after George Osborne’s dramatic reform of stamp duty at the Autumn Statement, which have made buying a home worth £1million or more far more expensive. Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said his party would stick with its policy of an annual levy – but suggested it may have to be amended following the Chancellor’s changes. Labour opponents of the party’s own mansion tax scheme have also stepped up their campaign to persuade Mr Balls to shift his position. But the Shadow Chancellor insisted in an interview with the Independent: ‘Saving the NHS will be at the heart of our first Budget. I would like to see that revenue coming in in the first year of a Labour government, before the end of the financial year. We will have to see the practicalities.’ Mr Balls denied charges could be imposed retrospectively. ‘A charge is paid in that year on the valuation on a date in that year. No one will have any doubt about our intentions,’ he insisted. The Coalition has sought to undermine Mr Balls’s pledge to raise £2.5billion for the NHS through a combination of the mansion tax, a levy on tobacco firms and reducing tax avoidance by hedge funds by announcing its own £3billion boost. Critics also pointed out that revenues from these measures were unlikely to start flowing in until the middle of the next Parliament. However, Mr Balls said Labour could legislate for the mansion tax to start in the following financial year of 2016-17 ‘as a backstop’. Labour’s mansion tax will be about £3,000 a year for homes in the £2million to £3million bracket. Experts say an average charge of £11,000 a year will need to be levied to raise the £1.2billion a year Labour predicts. The Conservatives claim it will be extended to cover cheaper properties.","It is unusual for tax to be introduced in the course of the financial year .

"A generous managing director has treated 20 hard-up families to Christmas dinner with all the trimmings. Roy Ganley, 49, had filled four supermarket trolleys with £500 of groceries and arrived unannounced at a foodbank in Bolton, Greater Manchester. The food is now being distributed to families who faced the tough choice of whether to heat their homes, buy their children gifts or be able to eat this Christmas. Big-hearted Roy Ganley (pictured on his big Christmas shopping trip) has splashed out on treating 20 hard-up families to Christmas dinner with all the trimmings . Roy, a father-of-two from Westhoughton, Bolton, said: 'It was something I wanted to do. I've never known there to be foodbanks before. People are struggling. 'I discussed it with my wife Lesley and the family and they were all for it.'

'It shows that people do care, and are prepared to think of others. The food bought will make a tremendous difference to the people in Farnworth and Kearsley.' Mr Ganley, who has two daughters, Charlotte, 22, and Natalie, 20, added: 'There will be people on Christmas day without a food on the table. 20 chickens . 20 jellies . 20 bags of potatoes . 20 bags of apples . 20 bags of tangerines . 20 jars of coffee . 20 bags of sugar . 20 bags of pasta . 20 trays of eggs . 20 bags of carrots . 20 boxes of tea bags .

'When I put it on Facebook asking for information a couple of people said it was a great idea and they would donate something too. 'Everybody can do something that will make a difference to somebody - 20 families will now have a good day.' Mr Ganley, a managing director at Bolton-based vehicle finance company First Step UK, was given a discount on his traditional Christmas fare by bosses at Lidl who also donated items to the foodbank after his big shop. Family friend Niki Ashton, who helped the  49-year-old back with his food-laden trolley after the shopping trip, said it had been a 'selfless act.' 'He has bought enough food for 20 families on Christmas day and for a few days afterwards - it is a most selfless thing to do and it is what Christmas is about,' she added.

"China-based criminals have mastered the ability to manufacture almost perfect bi-metallic coins, stoking fears the £2 coin is vulnerable to a new wave of forgeries. While the £1 coin remains heavily faked, the £2 has remained almost untouched because of the difficulty criminals have connecting the inner and outer pieces of the coin together. But a shipment of fake euro coins intercepted in Naples, Italy, three months ago, has revealed forgers are now producing bi-metallic coins in massive quantities. The seizure - the largest of its kind in the history of the Euro - is likely to cause concern among British investigators given its ramifications for the £2 coin. Scroll down for video . Coins such as the  £2 (left) and euro (right) are under threat from China-based forgers who have cracked the ability to connect the two pieces of metal together in a near perfect manner . Pictured is a counterfeit £2 coin (left) compared to a genuine coin (right). The comparison reveals most fake coins lack detail and the colouring of the originals . A shipment of fake euro coins worth £390,000 was intercepted in Italy in September. Pictured is a pile of euros during the legitimate production process . A British investigator told The Times counterfeiters had historically struggled to make convincing £2 coins. He said: 'You've always been able to tell a fake by dropping it on a table - they rattle because the two bits have not been stuck together properly.' Another investigator told the paper that the China to Italy counterfeit route was 'entirely feasible' and it should ring alarms bells if Chinese gangs were exporting to the country. Europol said the leader of the criminal group responsible for the influx of fake euro coins was thought to be operating from Shanghai, China, where he has links to a clandestine manufacturing facility and people to organise the shipping of the counterfeit money to Naples, Italy. A spokesperson for The Royal Mint said £2 coins have a large number of features that make them  difficult to forge. 'A bi-colour coin is much harder to counterfeit because replicating the two metal components, the inner and outer, is significantly more difficult than a single component coin. 'Forgers would also require a highly sophisticated press to produce bi-colour coins. 'The coin detector mechanism of vending machines and self-service check outs can detect the two different metal components, in addition to the conductivity, thickness and diameter of the coin. 'The addition of edge lettering is also very hard to counterfeit, and some circulating £2 coin designs also include a latent feature in their elements which is difficult to replicate.' 'On arrival in Italy, the coins are distributed throughout Europe by other members of the criminal group, led by the main suspect in Palermo, who is a Ghanaian national.' Twelve people were arrested this month after an  investigation was launched following September's seizure. Investigators said: 'From this first seizure, investigators realised that the criminal group had the capability to produce a vast quantity of good quality fake coins, as the criminals were using sophisticated manufacturing techniques, very similar to those used to produce authentic coins.' It was the largest such seizure in the history of the currency, and were so perfect they would work in vending machines across Europe. Palermo prosecutor Calogero Ferrara said: 'They were high-quality fakes produced at a clandestine Chinese mint and ready to be put on the Italian market just before the Christmas spending rush.' A spokesperson for The Royal Mint said a recent Britain-wide survey unearthed only one fake £2 coin and it worked closely with HM Treasury, the National Crime Agency and the cash-handling industry. 'Together we ensure that every effort is made to maximise opportunities to identify and withdraw counterfeit coins from circulation.'","Chinese criminals have developed ability to forge perfect bi-metallic coins .

"A businessman claims he has lost around £40,000 after he was wrongly issued with a parking ticket and was taken to court, affecting his credit rating. Bob Long, 61, had built up a successful pawn shop business over 40 years but now claims it is in tatters after he was denied credit because he was wrongly made the subject of a County Court judgement. The businessman was taken to court after he failed to pay a parking ticket - despite being told by the Radisson Blu hotel in Stansted that as long as he spent at least £35 inside the four star hotel he could park his three-year-old BMW convertible there for free. Mr Long ran up a bill of £135 in the hotel restaurant. Bob Long claims he has lost around £40,000 and his pawn broker business is in jeopardy after he was wrongly given a parking ticket and a county court judgement, which has severely affected his credit rating . Weeks later he found himself unable to borrow money to buy big items for his business because he had unknowingly been taken to court. Mr Long had received a fine from the parking company and sent it back with a letter explaining, on the advice of Radisson Blu. He then moved house assuming the matter was closed but a series of letters were sent to his old address and he was then made the subject of a court order. 'At this time of year we are using a lot of credit because people are trying to pawn their things ahead of Christmas,' said Mr Long of Norwich in Norfolk. 'This has absolutely stuffed me. I have lost my credibility and lost two of my oldest clients who have been doing business with me for more than 20 years.' Mr Long visited the restaurant in Radisson Blu hotel in August 2013 and parked his £30,000 BMW, which has a personalised 80BL numberplate, in the hotel car park - run by contractors ParkingEye. He said payment machines were broken upon his arrival but a concierge told him it would be free if he spent more than £35 in the restaurant. But he was stunned two weeks later when he received a fine from ParkingEye. Mr Long phoned the hotel who said he didn't have to pay and advised him to send the ticket back with a letter explaining the mix up. The shop owner followed their instructions but later moved to a new property five miles away thinking the matter was closed. Mr Long parked his £30,000 BMW at the hotel car park and was told he would not need to pay parking charges . Mr Long parked his car at the Radisson Blu hotel in Stansted airport while he enjoyed a business lunch and was told he could park for free as long as he spent a minimum £35 - but days later he was sent a ticket . This summer he realised something was amiss when he was rejected for credit from three different banks. He investigated and found he had a poor credit rating because ParkingEye had taken out a county court judgement for the unpaid ticket. 'At the moment we aren't making hay while the sun shines,;' he added. 'It is a bit like going to the restaurant getting a bad meal and then asking people to come back again. 'It is awful because normally at this time of year we are getting good stock in but now we are just recycling all our old stock. 'We have been in business over 40 years and we have got loyal customers but it is damaging the reputation of the company I have worked so hard to build. 'One parking ticket could have cost me between £30,000 or £40,000. 'I have had to turn down a deal for three classical cars because I needed £50,000 and I couldn't get that cash on credit.' He said his pawn broker shop is struggling and he has lost around £40,000 because he was unknowingly made the subject of a county court judgement and denied credit because of the unpaid parking ticket . Despite the fact he had changed his address with the DVLA the correspondence over the matter had already been set to his previous home. Radisson Blu have admitted they are wrong and claim they have applied for the judgement to be withdrawn. A spokesman said: 'We are sorry to hear about the parking fines that have been received by Mr Long. 'Radisson Blu Stansted does offer a parking waiver to guests visiting the hotel restaurant, with a minimum spend. In these instances we ask guests to enter their registration number at the hotel reception. 'Once a guest receives a parking ticket, we suggest that they contact Parking Eye if they wish to appeal. 'Unfortunately Parking Eye has confirmed to us that no letter of appeal was received from Mr Long.' ParkingEye, which operates the car park said: ''Unfortunately our records indicate that Mr Long did not appeal his parking charge. 'ParkingEye then pursues all available avenues before initiating court action, sending at least three further letters to the motorist including documentation on how to appeal to the industry's independent appeals service (which is completed at ParkingEye's cost) prior to issuing any court claim. ParkingEye relies, not unreasonably, on address information supplied to it by the DVLA as this information is supplied, in turn, by the registered keeper of the vehicle.' The company said they had since applied to have the County Court Judgement set aside, at their own cost.","Bob Long, 61, said pawn broker business is in tatters after ticket blunder .

"With a demon baby Jesus, skeletal wise men and the carcass of a lamb, a zombie-themed nativity scene caused quite a stir when it was unveiled in Ohio earlier this month. And now its creator, Jasen Dixon, has been ordered to kill the ten-foot by ten-foot structure because it violates local property maintenance codes. The Cincinnati resident has been given until December 26 to dismantle the display otherwise he will be slapped with a $1,000 fine. Gruesome: Zombie-themed nativity scene caused quite a stir when it was unveiled in Ohio earlier this month . Underfire: Now its creator, Jasen Dixon, has been ordered to kill the ten-foot by ten-foot structure because it violates local property maintenance codes . Officials in Ohio's Sycamore Township said they received two anonymous complaints about the placement of the zombie nativity. Regulations in the area state that structures  located in a front or  side yard should not occupy more than 35per cent of the area, and should be three feet from the street and six feet from the house. Dixon, who manages a haunted attraction in Indiana, unveiled his unconventional creation three weeks ago. He said he made the models for the zombie Mary and three wise men and borrowed props to make the Joseph and Jesus zombie figures. Red alert: Officials in Ohio's Sycamore Township said they received two anonymous complaints about the placement of the zombie nativity . All coming down: The Cincinnati resident has been given until December 26 to dismantle the display otherwise he will be slapped with a $1,000 fine . Source of inspiration: As Dixon also manages the 13 Rooms of Doom haunted house in Indiana, he had access to plenty of props . The baby Jesus is pale with totally white eyes, while the other life-sized figures are partly skeletal. Dixon said despite some backlash, many people approve of the display, which is lit by red and green lights. A Facebook page he made for it has attracted 200 'likes.' He said that at around 2am on Tuesday, he discovered three women in his front yard taking selfies with the display in the pouring rain. 'I never suspected it to be this big,' Dixon said. Greg Bickford, the township administrator, said the citation has nothing to do with the irreverent content of the display, which he called 'comical.' Rather it is to do with the size and location. Not for children: A lamb's carcass lays in the hay . Sight for sore eyes: Dixon said his father and neighbors aren't fans of the zombie scene . 'We’re complaint-driven,' Bickford said, when asked if other displays had been cited this season. 'If we were to drive up and down every single street and try to find violations, we’d never get off a street.' Dixon, who has lived in the neighborhood for 15 years and never received any other notices, was also cited for junk and debris on his property that he said was never an issue before. He said he is still considering what to do with the manger scene by the township’s Friday deadline, the day after Christmas. 'I haven’t decided,' he said. 'I don’t really know what’s going to happen.'","Jasen Dixon came up with his own twist on the classic nativity scene .

"It may be the must-have smartphone accessory this year. But a photo has emerged that shows the 'selfie stick' is not an entirely new invention and is in fact almost 90 years old. An image, taken of a couple in 1926, shows Arnold and Helen Hogg using a stick to take a picture of themselves on the street they lived in in Rugby, Warwickshire, just a year after they were married. Scroll down for video . A photo taken using a 'selfie stick' has emerged showing the popular modern device was being used in 1926 . The photograph, annotated with the words 'Self Taken, Oct 1926' is evidence that people were using selfie sticks to capture images of themselves long before the phenomenon was made popular this year by celebrities. The picture is only two inches wide and was found stuck in the back of a family album by the Hoggs’ grandson Alan Cleaver, of Whitehaven in Cumbria. It features the couple and shows the stick visible and being held by Mr Hogg. 'In our family it's always been a favourite photo and the fact that there is so much interest in it now would have been loved by granddad,' said Mr Cleaver. 'My granddad didn't take too many photos throughout his life but he took quite a few after he got married in the 1920s. We have a few photo albums of that time but most of them were quite boring, and then we found this photo stuck at the back. 'He was obviously trying something new. 'Sadly we think it's the only one he took like this that he felt happy enough to include in the album.' Mr Cleaver said his grandfather was an entertainer and musician but admits he never saw him use the 'selfie stick' . Alexander Remnev used a selfie stick to take this photo after he scaled  the 1,350ft Princes Tower in Dubai . Celebrities have also got into the act, with Dan Snow (left), Ben Fogle and June Sarpong using a selfie stick . Selfie sticks were named one of the greatest inventions of 2014 by Time magazine and has gained popularity . His grandfather used to play the piano at silent films where he lived in Rugby and would often entertain people wherever he went. During a family holiday to Benidorm in 1969 he was given a medal by a hotel owner after he delighted guests with his piano playing. Mr Cleaver added: 'I don't really know what was going on or why he chose to use the stick. His wife Helen looks suitably bemused in the photo. 'But it's absolutely no surprise he took something like this. He was always mucking about and trying to entertain people. I think he looks a bit like Charlie Chaplin in the photograph and he was a bit like him in real life. If you were in a pub and heard laughter it was always guaranteed to be him. He was an absolute star and a granddad you would dream of. The selfie stick has become a modern day gadget for tourists keen to picture themselves at landmarks . Celebrities have popularised the selfie, such as this picture taken on a mobile phone and featuring Jared Leto, Jennifer Lawrence, Meryl Streep, Ellen DeGeneres, Bradley Cooper, Peter Nyongío Jr., and, second row, from left, Channing Tatum, Julia Roberts, Kevin Spacey, Brad Pitt, Lupita Nyongío and Angelina Jolie . Scots adventurer Will Copestake took this picture of himself on a sheet of ice close to a glacier in Patagonia . 'He never spoke about the selfie stick. And I have no idea how he used it. Various photographic experts have had in depth discussions about what he was doing. Cameras in those days worked by the shutter being pulled on the side of the camera. He was probably just using the stick to hold the camera in position.' Selfie sticks have risen in popularity this year, with people going to great lengths to capture the perfect images of themselves leaning over precipices, in impossible poses and with stunning landmarks in the background. The devices were named as one of the greatest inventions of 2014 by Time Magazine and the modern-day contraption originated in Asia. They work by holding the camera in place at the end of the stick, usually about 3ft long, and have a button on the handle which presses the shutter so the photo can be taken. Selfie sticks are similar to monopods used with digital cameras but were invented specifically for smartphones this year.","Photograph taken 88 years ago shows selfie being taken with aid of a stick .

"A group of squatters who took over an expensive London building - complete with a penthouse - so they could serve the homeless lunch on Christmas Day are being removed by bailiffs. The 40-strong group, who call themselves The Love Activists, took over a five-storey Victorian building in Trafalgar Square in London to protest against the growing number of homeless people in Britain. The expensive grade II listed five-storey building called Cavell House has a secure vault in the basement and dozens of rooms. Bailiffs were at the property in Charing Cross Road this morning to try and evict the squatters. Around 30 people have been evicted, with two squatters seen teetering on the edge of the building's impressive balconies. Several more are believed to be hiding inside. Scroll down for video . Squatters calling themselves Love Activists were seen sitting on a balcony as bailiffs tried to remove them from an empty five-storey building in central London, protesting against the number of homeless people . Dozens of squatters were removed by bailiffs, supported by police this morning, from the London building . Police taped off the road and confirmed they had been called to assist the bailiffs and no arrests had been made so far. Scotland Yard said tonight 'On the instruction of the bailiffs, all but two of the people inside left the building. 'A man and a woman, believed to be in their twenties, were on a balcony for a period of time. 'The woman has since come down but the man currently remains on the balcony.' Shortly before 2pm a man, believed to be one of the squatters, appeared to be attempting to talk the couple down. Three police officers were later spotted trying to get them to come down from the balcony. The couple on the balcony were spotted kissing and calling for supporters below to bring them a cigarette lighter. The building had been covered in banners bearing the name 'Love Activists' put up by the group, who claim they have decided to take over in protest at the housing crisis. Tomorrow they had planned to invite the homeless and cook them a free Christmas lunch at the building. Pete Phoenix, 44, one of the Love Activist squatters, who like the rest claim to be homeless, said: 'We're a group of homeless who decided to do a Christmas dinner for street homeless and other squatters. 'The police have thrown most of us out but we are going to stay here as long as possible. We will get back in. Around 30 police filled Charing Cross Road to help bailiffs remove protesters from the Victorian building . A couple were seen on one of the balconies of the building and are believed to be the last remaining . Police and squatters gathered outside the entrance to the five-storey building this morning . The Love Activists branded the building Love HQ and the remaining couple were seen kissing (right) 'If we don't we'll be back on the street or we will find another squat.' Love Activist Steve said: 'We were told we could stay here until December 29 when we had a court hearing. But they came in and said we were leaving or were getting dragged out and said they had got an injunction. 'But they didn't show us any identification or papers. No one even knows who owns the building. The last company who owned it was liquidated.' The squatters were said to have their legal team at the High Court tonight trying to get the injunction on them varied so they could stay in the building. The building used to be home to National Westminster Bank and was previously leased to RBS and has been left empty since 2013 when the banking group handed it back to its owners. This is listed as a company called Greencap Ltd, a Jersey company that according to Land Registry documents appears to have been dissolved. The squatters decided to target the former RBS HQ because the bank was one of the institutions bailed out by the taxpayer during the financial crisis. A statement on the group's Facebook page said: 'Love Activists and Squatter and Homeless Autonomy (SHA) have seized a disused RBS bank abandoned for two years in the heart of Westminster; a building that has been taken by the people, for the people. The listed building in Trafalgar Square has been empty since last year and was taken over by squatters . Officers said they were called to the building (left) to prevent a breach of the peace by protesters (right) Dozens of squatters were being removed from the building in Trafalgar Square this morning . Police were called to help bailiffs remove squatters this morning, and one was seen standing on a balcony . The squatters had planned to invite other homeless people inside the building tomorrow for Christmas lunch . 'RBS was bailed out £46 billion by the taxpayer, equating a loss of £1500 per UK taxpayer. This means RBS are 82% owned by the people of the UK. This is a public repossession. 'Despite the 1.5 million empty buildings there are 110,000 homeless people in the UK this winter, and squatting is a direct solution to this housing crisis.' The protesters said they were keen to break back into the building and were trying to gather support on social media. One said: 'We will gather enough people and we will rush the bank again. Police taped off Charing Cross road as officials removed the squatters and said there had been no arrests . The protesters said they had been wanting to help people who had been left homeless over Christmas . Banners put up over the building protest against homelessness and have been displayed by the group . Love Activists, a group of around 40 squatters, took over the Victorian listed building on Saturday . Love Activists said they targeted the RBS building because the bank was bailed out by taxpayers and thousands of people in England are still struggling to find a home, with 110,000 homeless last year . 'We will get about 500 people here and we are going back through the doors and into the building.' Squatters moved into the building in Charing Cross road on Saturday and the doors are now bolted with padlocks and planks of wood. Last year 112,070 people declared themselves homeless in England. The number of homeless people has increased by 26 per cent in four years. More people are sleeping rough in London, with 6,437 on the streets last year. This was an increase of eight per cent compared to two years before. Last year more people aged 25-44 declared themselves homeless than any other age group. Government figures predict 93,000 children in Britain - the equivalent to three in every school - will spend this Christmas homeless. Other banners said 'Seized by the people for the people.' As well as the Christmas lunch the group also planned to hold workshops for the homeless, including one called 'How to squat.' They are also advertising on their Facebook page for donations of food, tools, sleeping equipment and pots and pans so they can help as many homeless people as possible over Christmas. Organisers posted a link to a page where people can make online donations, but wrote: 'We would prefer non-financial donations, as we all know money corrupts.' Squatting is a problem in London. Earlier this year a group took over a £3million grade II listed building in Southwark in South London. The building had been dubbed Britain's most expensive council house and was quickly covered with banners saying 'Homes for all' and 'Stop social cleansing'. Around 20 people occupied the building.","Group of squatters called Love Activists took over central London building .

"This Jack Russell was found wandering the streets of Poole dressed in a festive red and white coat . This lonely dog  was found wandering the streets dressed as Father Christmas  - and now faces spending the festive period alone after being separated from his owners. The adorable Jack Russell was found wandering the streets of Poole, Dorset, dressed in a tiny red Father Christmas coat with a white felt collar and belt. Dog wardens had hoped to reunite the dog with his owners before Christmas Day - but no one has come forward. Becky Corbin, an animal welfare officer at Poole council, said: 'He was wearing the Christmas outfit with a camouflage coat underneath when we found him. 'There was no one around at the time I picked him up, apart from a boy on a paper round who found the dog wandering on the street. 'He appears to be looked after but that is only our initial understanding. 'He has enjoyed playing with a tennis ball. 'The dog will be kept in the possession of the council for seven days, then we will look to re-home him.' Animal charity Dogs Trust is reminding families that a dog is for life and not just for Christmas. Previously Giles Webber, responsible for rehoming at Dogs Trust's 20 rehoming centres said: 'With more and more puppies flooding the Christmas market, all available at the click of a button, it is more essential than ever that our message ""A Dog is For Life, Not Just For Christmas"" is ingrained in people's minds. The dog is pictured with animal welfare officer Becky Corbin who is appealing for his owners to come forward . The UK dog population as of 2013 is estimated at 8.5 million and an estimated seven in 10 of all stray dogs are Staffordshire Bull Terriers. According to Save the Strays more than 126,000 dogs are picked up by local authorities across the UK each year. Of those more than 30,000 homeless dogs are sent to rescue centres every year to be re-homed, and more than 7,000 end up being euthanised every year when a home cannot be found. In 2013 30 per cent of dogs were abandoned in the first three months of 2013 alone, with financial difficulties and relationship breakdowns the most common reasons dogs are abandoned. More than half, 54 per cent, of pets whose owners break up are abandoned after couples can't decide who should keep the pet. In 2013 Battersea Dogs and Cats home cared for 5,421 dogs in 2013 and has around 400 dogs across its sites or on foster at all time.","Jack Russell was found wandering the streets dressed as Father Christmas .

"More than 620 laptops have been stolen from the BBC and its staff in the last five years. The corporation has also had 83 iPads, 109 mobile phones, 34 desktop computers and 98 cameras taken in the same five-year period, it has been revealed. It comes after staff complained the BBC's £1bn New Broadcasting House in central London was 'swarming with petty thieves' who stole everything from bananas and sandwiches to trousers. Gone: More than 620 laptops have been stolen from the BBC and its staff in the last five years, figures reveal just days after it emerged staff at New Broadcasting House (above) said it was 'swarming with petty thieves' Among the more unusual thefts between 2010 and 2014 were four kettles and two fire-extinguishers. Even a sign telling staff not to steal toilet paper was taken from a toilet by a thief earlier this month. The new figures were obtained from the BBC in a Freedom of Information Act request by the Parliament Street think-tank. Its director, Clare George-Hilley, said: 'These findings show that the BBC must do more to prevent theft and losses at every level of the organisation, taxpayers should not have to pick up the bill for sloppy management of expensive equipment. 'To tackle this, the organisation needs to deliver more effective policies and training to ensure staff understand the importance of looking after devices.' Ariel - the BBC's in-house magazine – has reported thefts inside New Broadcasting House were becoming 'increasingly common' and revealed earlier this month three private letters to economics editor Robert Peston had been stolen from his desk. Theft: The tally of stolen devices over the past five years also included 83 iPads (file photo) The magazine reported thefts of high-value electronic items had been stopped following an in-house investigation earlier this year. The figures show the theft of laptops at the corporation peaked in 2012 when 205 of them were taken – compared to 84 this year. More than 20 iPads have been stolen in each of the past three years, The Guardian reported last night. The new information also reveals that Broadcasting House staff have reported theft of food and items of clothing. The BBC said in a statement last night: 'With thousands of staff and people coming and going in more than 150 BBC buildings at any one time, it is regrettably inevitable personal property and other items occasionally go missing. 'The BBC takes such incidents seriously and has implemented a number of crime prevention measures.' The broadcaster also stressed that said the list of stolen items included 'all property stolen, whether BBC property or personal possessions of individuals'.

The extremist, who called himself Abu Abdel Malik al-Britani, became the thirty fifth Briton to have been killed while fighting for ISIS in Syria this week. In the image the militant is seen wearing camouflage gear as he proudly brandishes the weapon on a shopping street. He is understood to have been killed alongside two Canadian jihadis during fierce clashes in the Syrian desert town of Dabiq. He is just the latest in a steady flow of British militants to be killed fighting for ISIS in the Middle East - a figure that has grown dramatically towards the end of the year as American-led airstrikes target the group's strongholds and Kurdish YPG and Peshmerga forces retake land from the terrorists. Today it was revealed that US-led air strikes in Syria and Iraq have killed more than 1,000 jihadis in the past three months, nearly all of them from the Islamic State. 'At least 1,171 have been killed in the Arab and international air strikes [since September 23], including 1,119 jihadists of the Islamic State group and Al-Nusra Front,' said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on a network of activists and medics across the war-ravaged country for its information. Among the dead were 1,046 members of IS, which has seized large chunks of Iraq and Syria and is the main target of the air campaign. Seventy-two of those killed were members of Al-Qaeda's branch in Syria, the Al-Nusra Front, while another was a jihadist prisoner whose affiliation was unknown, an Observatory statement said. The remaining 52 were civilians. Abu Abdel Malik's death was announced on social media by a fighter of Algerian origin who goes by the nom de guerre Abu Musab and who claims to have trained alongside the militant in Syria. He said the Briton was killed in Dabiq alongside two militants of Canadian origin named Abu Ibrahim Al-Canadi & Abu Abdullah Al-Canadi. ISIS supporters on social media raised the possibility that the pair could be Calgary-raised brothers Collin and Greg Gordon, who joined ISIS in August having only recently converted to Islam. Details of Abu Abdel Malik's true identity are not known and reports of his death could not be independently verified. The Foreign Office said it was aware of reports of the death of a British national, but could not confirm their legitimacy due to the lack of consular presence in Syria. He is just the latest in a long line of British killed fighting for ISIS in Syria and Iraq in recent months - many of them having travelled to join the group after its declaration of a so-called caliphate in the vast swaths of territory it controls, and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's self-appointment as a caliph.

Canada's Gordon bothers (Collin pictured) joined ISIS in August having only recently converted to Islam . Abu Abdel Malik was killed in Dabiq alongside two militants of Canadian origin named Abu Ibrahim Al-Canadi & Abu Abdullah Al-Canadi . The number of British deaths has risen dramatically towards the end of the year, as the fighter's naive expectations of Call of Duty-style warfare are replaced by the brutal reality of fierce battles with the group's enemies: Al Qaeda-affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra, the Free Syrian Army, Syrian and Iraqi regime armies, Sunni tribes, Shia militias, and a number of other rebel groups in the area. Their fight is made even harder by near constant airstrikes from warplanes sent by the U.S. and its Arab allies in Syria; and from America, Belgium, Canada, France, Netherlands, Australia and of course Britain itself in neighbouring Iraq. The greatest number of Britons killed fighting for ISIS, however, have been killed in street battles with Kurdish YPG and Peshmerga troops, who have been making huge gains in northern Syria and western Iraq since September, having lost vast swaths of territory to ISIS earlier in the year. In recent weeks there have been a number of reports of British militants expressing their desire to return to Britain having grown disillusioned with the reality of fighting for ISIS. Professor Peter Neumann from King's College London's International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation says he was contacted by a man representing a group of up to 30 British militants, all of whom wanted to return to the UK but were worried about being arrested on their return. He believes as many as a fifth of British fighters in the country could be trying to find a way out of their current situation and claimed less-hardened jihadists could be used to show would-be recruits that the reality of battle may not match the image presented by ISIS propaganda. Militants: Coventry teenagers Ali Kalantar, 19, (left) known as Ali al-Farsi, and Rashid Amani (pictured right as a schoolboy) were killed in Iraq and Syria respectively while fighting for the Islamic State . Jihadi: Rashid Amani, 19, had been fighting for Islamic State in the besieged Syrian town of Kobane when he suffered serious wounds from a US air strike . Sick: Former supervisor at Primark, 25-year-old Muhammad Hamidur Rahman (left), was one of four Portsmouth jihadis killed fighting in Syria. In November Kabir Ahmed (right), a 30-year-old father of three from Derby, blew himself up in Iraq killing eight people and injuring 15 others . As many as 35 British nationals are believed to have died fighting for Islamist groups over the last 12 months - although the number is likely to be far higher as reports of deaths largely centre on those who maintain contact with the West through social media accounts on Facebook or Twitter. The Home Office says over 550 individuals of interest to the security services have travelled to the region from the UK since the start of the conflict. It is estimated around half of these have returned. The first known death came over a year ago when Ifthekar Jaman - a 23-year-old from Portsmouth who described his life in the Middle East as 'five star jihad' was killed fighting for Jabhat al-Nusra. In September four British men  were killed in a single U.S. airstrike in the Syrian city of Aleppo. Among then was 19-year-old Ibrahim Kamara who was born and raised in Brighton. Other British fighters who have been killed in the fighting include teen-aged brothers Abdullah and Jaffar Deghayes from Brighton, East Sussex. Jaffar, 17, is believed to have died in October trying to overthrow dictator Assad's government. His brother, Abdullah, 18, died in Latakia province in April after leaving the UK in January to reportedly take up arms with al-Nusra. Their older brother Amer Deghayes, 20, is believed to still be in Syria fighting for Jabhat al-Nusra. Dead: Left is one of the last images of Ifthekar Jaman, a British national who died fighting  in Syria last year . Relaxed: Briton Abdul Waheed Majeed (white shirt) was seen pointing up the sky while posing for photos moments before driving a truck full of explosives into a prison killing himself and many others in February . In October it emerged that a fourth man from Portsmouth, Hampshire - Muhammad Mehdi Hassan, 19 - had died fighting in Kobane, the scene of fierce fighting between Kurds and ISIS. Three others from the same city - Iftekar Jaman, 23, Mamunur Roshid, 24, and Muhammad Hamidur Rahman, 25 - have also been killed after travelling there in October 2013. Another city that has produced a number of jihadis is Coventry. So far two young Britons - Ali Kalantar, 18, and Rashid Amani, 19, have been killed in US airstrikes on Kobane. Their 19-year-old friend Mohammed Hadi, also known as Abu Yahya al-Kurdi, is the only living member of the trio that travelled to Syria from the Midlands city in March of this year. Anger: In recent weeks three British men of African descent are known to have died fighting for ISIS. They include Abu Abdullah al-Habashi (left) who previously featured in a chilling ISIS propaganda video filmed in Dabiq, and Abu Dharda as-Somali (right) Names of other British nationals known to have died in Syria include Abdul Waheed Majeed - a 41-year-old suicide bomber from Crawley; Kabir Ahmed - a 30-year-old father of three from Derby who blew himself up in July; and Abu Abdullah al-Britani and Abu Abdullah al-Hajar, whose names are known but whose life and death details remain clouded in speculation. In recent weeks three British men of African descent are known to have died fighting for ISIS - Abu Abdullah al-Habashi, Abu Dharda as-Somali, and Abu Musa as-Somali. All three are understood to have been killed fighting in Syria, with Abu Abdullah al-Habashi having previously featured in a chilling ISIS propaganda video filmed in Dabiq. While the escalation in deaths of British nationals fighting for ISIS may way put off some would-be jihadis joining the terror group, it may not have quite the impact many would expect. Fingers raised: The third British man of African descent killed fighting for ISIS is Abu Musa as-Somali (pictured left alongside the aforementioned Abu Abdullah al-Habashi . The fear is that the deaths may actually attract more would-be jihadis to join ISIS, as young Westerners are sucked into the warped romance of martyrdom in the name of religion. Those killed are referred to my their jihadist friends as 'green birds' in reference to passages in the Koran that talks about martyrs living in the hearts of green birds in paradise. In fact references to green birds are so prevalent among Islamic extremists that the easily influenced claim to pray for death to come quickly to hasten their arrival in the afterlife. A Home Office spokesperson said: 'The UK advises against all travel to Syria and parts of Iraq. Anyone who does travel to these areas, even for humanitarian reasons, is putting themselves in considerable danger of harm.' 'The best way for the public to help is to donate to or otherwise support UK-registered charities that have ongoing relief operations.'","Briton Abu Abdel Malik al-Britani was killed fighting for ISIS in Syria .

"After weeks of leaking emails that painted top Hollywood executives as catty, crass and sometimes racist, posting highly guarded movie scripts online for public viewing, and ultimately threatening the possibility of a terrorist attack at theaters across America, North Korea today saw their quest to stop the release of the Kim Jong-un assassination film The Interview foiled as the film officially became available to rent or own online, one day before it hits theaters and video on demand. It is a major victory for Sony considering all they had to go through just to get the film released, dealing with a massive hack that President Obama has called an act of 'cyber vandalism' on the part of North Korea. After all that however, there seems to be yet another hurdle standing in the studio's way - the film Sony fought so hard to release is getting slammed by critics. Scroll down for videos . The reviews are in: Critics have begun releasing their reviews of The Interview, and they are not good . Harsh: Variety wrote of the film, 'North Korea is right to object' Big day: This as the film was released online today, and will be in theaters and on video on demand on Thursday . Reviews of the film are slowly starting to pour in, and most critics are not impressed with the comedy, citing problems with everything from the plot to the acting and frequently comparing the massive studio film to an lackluster episode of Saturday Night Live. Variety critic Scott Foundas starts of his review by stating that 'North Korea is right to object' to the film, this before he goes on to warn readers eager to see the film that 'an evening of cinematic waterboarding awaits.' That's not all either, as he also calls the picture 'about as funny as a communist food shortage,' and declares that 'America comes off looking at least as bad as the DPRK' in the film. Joe Morgenstern of the Wall Street Journal seems equally unimpressed, especially with star James Franco who, he notes; 'Mugs shamelessly to make sure we understand that he’s being funny, which he’s not.' As for the feel of the film, Morgenstern writes; 'Think Saturday Night Live on a really bad night.' Though a bit more mixed in his review, The Hollywood Reporter's Todd McCarthy still declares the picture 'wildly uneven.' He is however slightly kinder than Morgenstern in describing the feel of the film, which he believes 'has the comic batting average of a mediocre-to-average Saturday Night Live sketch.' Stephanie Zacharek of The Village Voice notes that the film 'offers a few moments of casual brilliance,' but ultimately 'trips itself up in the threads of its contrived absurdity.' Sorry bud: James Franco is described in one review as not being funny . Almost every critic does however praise the performance of Randall Park, who plays Kim Jong-un in the film. Park, perhaps best known for playing Danny Chung, the political rival of Julia Louis-Dreyfus' Selena Meyer on Veep, delivers a 'sympathetic' and 'complex' performance as the Supreme Leader according to Time's Richard Corliss. He is also singled out by David Ehrlich of TimeOut, in a review that uses a now familiar comparison to describe the film. 'It’s Park’s performance that elevates the premise of a routine SNL sketch into the stuff of a compelling and genuinely radical feature, the actor portraying Kim as an endearingly deranged despot with nuclear daddy issues,' writes Ehrlich. Praise: Despite the mixed to bad reviews, the performance of Randall Park as Kim Jong-un is uniformly praised by the critics . Seth Rogen, who not only stars in the film but also wrote and directed the picture alongside his childhood pal turned writing, directing and producing partner Evan Goldberg, also gets some love in a rave review from Tess Hoffmann at The Playlist, who compares The Interview to the last film he and Goldberg wrote and directed, the critically praised disaster comedy This Is the End. 'Goldberg and Rogen navigate this minefield of prurient humor and political incorrectness with aplomb, delivering a high-concept spy thriller comedy that feels as carefree as This Is the End while managing not to ruin the thrills by too clumsily dumbing down the realities the film plays with,' writes Hoffmann. The film also got high marks from Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers who praised both Rogen and Franco's work in the picture while also applauding the comedy's 'bad taste.' Writes Travers; 'The Interview hits the sweet spot for raunchy fun and spiky lampooning because Franco and Rogen are effing hilarious and fearless about swinging for the fences.' History repeating: Many reviews also make mention of the 2004 film Team America: World Police, which was a satire about Kim Jong-il, the father of Kim Jong-un, and also ended with his death . It is also worth noting that more than a few critics make mention of the last film to mock a North Korean leader, the Matt Parker and Trey Stone comedy Team America: World Police, which told the story of a paramilitary anti-terrorism force based out of Mount Rushmore who were tasked with stopping a terrorist plot crafted by Kim Jong-un's father, former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il. The film is remarkably similar to The Interview in its ridiculous characterization of the villain, in this case Kim Jong-il, and also ends with the death of the North Korean leader. Unlike The Interview though, the characters in Team America are all marionettes and not actual actors. That film  was released in 2004 to no real controversy, save an order from Kim Jong-il that  the Czech Republic to ban the film. The Czech Republic refused his request.","Reviews for the much discussed Kim Jong-un assassination film The Interview are slowly being released .

"An elderly couple have been left seriously injured after a vicious attack by a suspected burglar in their quiet, cul-de-sac home. Eric and Joyce Davey remain in hospital with throat and head injuries respectively after being attacked in their home in Scunthorpe, north Lincolnshire, yesterday afternoon. The couple, aged 90 and 86, were discovered after neighbours saw a man fleeing their property in a white van. A 36-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of burglary. An elderly couple were 'viciously' attacked in their own home in Scunthorpe. Police have arrested a 36-year-old man on suspicion of burglary . 'This was a vicious attack on two elderly and vulnerable members of the community in their own home,' said Detective Inspector Jon Cross. While it is believed the couple were assaulted by the man attempting to burgle them, it is not known whether or not the man stole anything from the property. 'It is believed they were assaulted by the man who was attempting to burgle them,' a Humberside Police spokesman said. 'At this time it is not known whether anything was stolen.' Neighbours described their shock that such a violent attack could take place in such a quiet area. 'It’s just a small community street. When things like this happen, you just can’t believe it,' said Martin Sloan. 'I hope all the best for them. I hope everything’s OK.' Officers were called to the home in Scunthorpe following reports of a man fleeing the property in a white van . Mr Sloan added the couple do not interact with neighbours much, but had lots of security installed at their house. 'I thought it was a car alarm further down the street but, as it progressed, we understand that it was the alarm on his house. 'We saw them come out. It didn’t look very good. 'It’s unbelievable. You wouldn’t think something like this would happen on this street. Definitely not. 'I know everybody on this street. It’s quite a shock really to find out that something like this has happened.' 'They kept themselves to themselves, basically. We keep ourselves to ourselves. But we still look out for people. 'He’s got CCTV all over the place and I don’t really know what’s happened. 'It’s a very, very quiet street. It’s a very quiet area. It’s a good area. It’s quite shocking to hear what’s gone on.' Another neighbour, Suzanne Cowling, said: 'Nobody deserves that in their own home. It’s not right.'

"Move over Movember. There's a new facial hair fundraising initiative in town. Beard Baubles have hit the mainstream, becoming one of the biggest fashion accessories of the season and even making an appearance at the World Darts Championship. The multi-coloured festive baubles, which attach gently to facial hair, are popping up on beards all over the world, from the UK to Australia. One man - 22-year-old Callum Storey, from Sevenoaks, Kent, - even flaunted his Beard Baubles at the William Hill World Darts Championship at Alexandra Palace in north London last night. Scroll down for video . The multi-coloured festive Beard Baubles, which attach to facial hair, are popping up on beards all over the world, including Callum Storey, 22, who sported them at the World Darts Championship in London last night . Mr Storey, 22, from Sevenoaks, Kent, flaunted his festive Beard Baubles at the William Hill World Darts Championship at Alexandra Palace in north London last night . Several people wore festive attire for the darts championship at Alexandra Palace last night (pictured) He could be seen with an array of the tiny ornaments nestled in his facial hair, as he sipped a pint and watched the likes of Mervyn King and Max Hopp compete. The baubles are the brainchild of creative agency Grey London, situated in the Farringdon area of the capital. The agency set up a partnership with Jimmy Niggles, the founder of Beard Season - an initiative to raise awareness for skin cancer by encouraging men to grow their beard during the month of December. Much like Movember, when men are encouraged to grow a moustache while raising money for prostate cancer, testicular cancer and mental health issues, Beard Season aims to raise awareness of melanoma. All proceeds from Grey London's Yuletide facial hair accessory – which cost £5 for a pack of 14 – go to the charity. Mr Storey, who recently resigned from his job as a headhunter to return to university to study a master's degree in finance, said he strongly supported the Beard Season campaign. He said: 'I had a cancer in my foot when I was 14, so I support all the drives like this and get involved because it raises awareness. Beard Baubles were the brainchild of creative agency Grey London, situated in central London . 'I had a really rare tumour and had to have my big toe amputated on my left foot. I was in remission until two or three years ago and then I got the all clear.' He said he started growing his beard on September 29 and now hopes to continue growing it long into the new year. ‘There’s nothing to lose getting involved in these things, I like growing a full beard,’ he said. ‘You can raise money for charity, but even if you don’t, you’re still raising awareness. ‘If people can relate, then it’s always good.’ Mr Storey, who will begin his master’s degree at Nottingham Trent University in January, said he chose to wear the facial baubles as part of his fancy dress, but also to raise awareness of Beard Season. He said: ‘Last night was the first time I’ve worn them. A few people came up to me and asked for my picture and everyone wanted to touch them.’ Grey London said Beard Baubles have been so popular, flying off shelves from the UK to Australia, that they had now sold out. Ollie Dearn, who works at the agency, said: 'The product has been particularly popular with Brits. 'We've sold more than we ever expected. 'But Aussie, American, Kiwis, German and French customers have been purchasing Beard Baubles too.' Each pack contains 14 multi-coloured baubles to attach to beard bristles - ten large balls and four small ones. The success of the product grew after Grey London decided to feature the facial hair accessory in their annual Christmas cards to clients. Mr Dearn said: 'Each year, Grey London makes a Christmas card to send out to clients and other agencies. Grey London has teamed up with Beard Season, an initiative which aims to raise awareness of skin cancer. They money from each bag of the multi-coloured baubles sold goes to the non-profit Beard Season charity . 'This year, the creative team, Mike Kennedy and Pauline Ashford, went one step further and came up with a festive gift idea to feature on our cards - Beard Baubles. It was a striking image.' The craze isn't just a hit with humans either. 'We've heard about hairy dogs wearing Beard Baubles too,' Mr Dearn added. Beard Baubles have in fact been so successful that they have now sold out across Europe. Ms Ashford, one of the creatives at Grey London, told MailOnline: 'The interest has been huge, it seems bearded men (and dogs) all over the world have been neglected at Christmas time up until now. 'We physically couldn't make enough Beard Baubles to satisfy the demand and post them all out in time for Christmas. But we'll be ready next year. 'Because there was still massive interest after we sold out of Original Beard Baubles, ​we decided that we would create some Limited Edition packs, to raise even more money for melanoma research, and to stretch the skin cancer awareness campaign longer over the festive period, especially in Australia where it is summer.' All proceeds from the baubles go to Beard Season, a non-profit Australian-based charity which works to raise awareness of melanoma. Much like Movember, when men are encouraged to grow a moustache while raising money for prostate cancer, testicular cancer and mental health issues, Beard Season aims to raise awareness of melanoma . For every bag of baubles sold, the money will go to Beard Season - a charity which encourages men to grow a beard for December. Men are urged to upload photos of their facial hair to Twitter using #BeardBaubles . The outfit has been running its December-themed initiative in Australia for the last two years, but has become more well-known in the UK since it teamed up with Grey London's Beard Baubles. Men are encouraged to grow their beard for the entire month, and upload photographs of their progress – and Beard Baubles - to social media under #BeardBaubles. Beard Season founder Mr Niggles - who is also known as Scott Maggs -  said the support of the initiative had been 'phenomenal'. He told Philanthropy: 'The real goal of the #BeardBaubles isn't raising funds, it's inspiring action, and every day now, hundreds of people are signing up as Beard Season Ambassadors on our website, following us on social media, booking skin checks, and spreading the word. 'We've generated millions in earned media, and if we can save at least one life through early detection of melanoma, then it's all been worthwhile.'

"An awarding winning homing pigeon used for  breeding and worth a staggering £120,000 has been stolen from an aviary. The owner of the pigeon, which is named AS 969, has now offered an £8,000 reward for the successful recovery of their beloved money spinner. Police claim the theft was either an inside job or carried out by pigeon 'connoisseurs' after they identified the bird as the most valuable in an aviary full of other homing pigeons in Germany. Homing pigeons, such as the one pictured, have been used for centuries to carry messages across long distances. File image used . Dusseldorf police said the 6-year-old male bird was stolen at some point on Saturday night from the locked aviary, located in the city's suburbs. A police spokesperson told The Local Germany that to untrained eyes it looked like any other pigeon, but it had 'good genes' that would be obvious to a homing pigeon breeder. It had won several prizes and its offspring raced in South Africa, they added. Homing pigeons have been used to carry messages over long distances for centuries. They have been utilized by the military, news agencies and governments, and were responsible for the very first air mail services.","Police say pigeon 'connoisseurs' are to blame for theft of valuable bird .

"With a trail of light sparkling away in the night sky, are these the images that show Father Christmas is hard at work above Britain on his busiest night of the year? The long streak of light was spotted in the night sky above London tonight as families were settling in for Christmas Eve. But although Santa Claus may well have started his deliveries early this year, scientists have another explanation for the display. Scroll down for video . Residents in London may be forgiven for thinking the long streak of light in the night sky was Father Christmas delivering presents . The long line of light was seen high above the London skyline and across other parts of southern England tonight . Experts have revealed that the long streak of light was in fact the International Space Station (pictured) Residents across southern England enjoyed the best views of the streak of light - which experts have revealed was the International Space Station passing above. The man-made satellite appeared as a small dot of light moving across the night sky at about 5.20pm today. It was only visible for about three minutes, according to the Independent. Stargazers were told to look to the west at 35 degrees from the horizon. The newspaper quotes the Met Office as saying 'The space station will be passing over – and it might look like Santa’s sleigh.' It comes as a major operation was launched earlier today aimed at tracking Santa Claus as he makes his annual delivery of presents. Hundreds of highly trained experts at NORAD follow the live action on a big screen normally used by the US Air Force . The National Air Traffic service tracked Santa's deliveries last year as he flew all over Europe, pictured . Santa left his top-secret toy factory deep underneath the North Pole several hours ago, with Rudolf leading the reindeer on their trip around the world. International aircraft have been warned to steer clear of the North Pole as Santa Claus dashes around the world at almost the speed of light. Central to the tracking operation is the North American Aerospace Defense Command, who have been following Santa's movements from space since 1955. Before the invention of satellites, ground observers had to try and spot the reindeer-powered sleigh as it shot across the night-time sky. NORAD is especially busy on Christmas Eve and has brought in volunteers in order to field hundreds of phone calls, emails and tweets from anxious children, wondering what time Santa will arrive.","The long streak of light was seen in the sky above London earlier tonight .

"A £2,300 camera, two Cartier watches and a top-of-the-range oboe worth £600 are among the valuables which were left on London's tubes and buses this year. Transport for London pocketed almost £300,000 between January and October through selling off more than 4,000 items of property - such as Apple Macbooks and jewellery - which were left on the transport network. In total, there were more than 260,000 items left on the different modes of transport during the ten-month period - the largest total for several years. The most expensive item left on London transport this year was a Canon DSLR camera, which sold for £2,301 - complete with the lens - at auction . A Cabart oboe was one of the 260,000 items left by passengers on the Transport for London network. It went on to fetch £599 at auction . A freedom of information request by the Evening Standard revealed that the highest-valued item sold at auction was a Canon EOS digital camera and lens, which went for £2,301 in March. A Cabart oboe, sold in the same month, raised £599. Two months later, a Cartier Panthère wristwatch - complete with an 18-carat gold case and bracelet - sold for £1,480, while another ladies Cartier watch sold for £600. Among the top 10 most expensive auction items were Apple laptops, which were sold for up to £650. They can cost up to £1,599 new. Two Cartier watches sold for almost £2,100 after being sold by the TfL Lost Property Office . TfL says it does not profit from the proceeds. Instead, the income subsidises the cost of running its Baker Street lost property office, now in its 80th year. Meanwhile, the 260,000 lost items handled by the property office included 20,309 mobile phones, 18,433 Oyster card holders and 11,580 wallets or purses. These three items have remained the three most likely items to be lost for the past three years. More than 80 per cent of the unclaimed items were given to charities such as the Salvation Army and the British Red Cross after three months. This year - for the eighth time - more than 200 toys were donated to the Salvation Army from TfL's Lost Property office to hand out to children in Lewisham in time for Christmas. The brand new toys - still in their original packaging - include dolls, teddy bears and toy cars, as well as board games and electronic gadgets. Around 25 per cent of items found on TfL services are returned to their owner. Sue Tyler, of TfL's lost property office, said: 'The fact that so many items have been handed in over 80 years is a testament to the honesty of the travelling public in London.' She added: 'It is a shame the children's toys were not reclaimed by their owners, but it is just wonderful to know they will now bring smiles to children who might have otherwise gone without.' TfL's transport services include London Buses, London Underground, London Overground, the Dockland Light Railway, licensed taxis, Victoria Coach Station and the Emirates Air Line cable car. Over the years, items which have been handed in include false teeth and limbs, wedding dresses, stuffed animals, urns of ashes and even a parachute.

"A group of Australian filmmakers spent 15 hours on the ultimate boys trip - travelling to 24 Sydney beaches across the space of a day. The idea for the video voyage was spawned when a friend of the four-strong production team turned 28, and celebrated by visiting 28 beaches in one day. From Maroubra Beach, in Sydney's east, to Palm Beach, in the north, the group were lucky when the clouds blew away - leaving clear blue skies and sunshine in their wake. Scroll down for video . Rocky start: The video opens with rough waves crashing against a rock cliff at one of the many iconic beaches featured in the video . Southernmost point of the expedition: The furthest south the four member production team went was Maroubra Beach, the most southern surfing beach in Sydney's eastern suburbs . Chilling in Summer Bay: The expedition ended at Sydney's Palm Beach, the setting for the popular long-running soap opera Home And Away . 'We wanted to show off Sydney and its beaches as best we could,' The Runaways Production House co-founder and managing director, Alex Dann, told Daily Mail Australia. 'We decided on 24 beaches, because we figured that was the most we could fit in during one day.' When asked about snubbing the beaches south of Maroubra, in Sydney's Sutherland Shire, Mr Dann was hopeful for The Runaways future endeavours: 'Next time, we'll try and get 31.' Rising with the sun: The first dip into the ocean of the day came as the sun was rising . The production team arrived at the beach so early, that council workers were still cleaning the sand . From beach to bay: While they visited 24 beaches, some of the swimming in the videos is limited to ocean baths . 'Growing up in Sydney, the beach has always been around and there are such amazing beaches here - we just wanted to show that off,' Mr Dann said. 'I think Palm Beach was probably my favourite, because it marked the end of a very long day,' he said. 'It was very rewarding to get there and have a beer.' On his favourite beach of the 24 visited, Mr Dann was quick to name Little Manly. 'I really enjoyed Little Manly, which was one of the ones I'd never visited before,' Mr Dann said. 'It was a great little beach that I'd never heard of to be honest.' Messing about: A poodle was one of the few beachgoers at this bayside northern Sydney gem . Carved in cement: A statue, with eastern Sydney gang The Bra Boys' catchphrase 'My Brothers Keeper', can be seen in the video . Beachside street art: A graffiti mural of an owl was used in an interest way to transition to another beachside locale . On what exciting videos viewers can be looking forward to in the future, Mr Dann said The Runaways team have an action-packed start for 2015. 'Next year we have a few trips lined up,' he said. 'We're very passionate about travel videos and adventuring, so we've got a few trips lined up in a few countries that we're hoping to release around mid-next year.' Production of the video took five days, with one day spent shooting it and four days of post-production. Impressively, the postcard-style graphics were put into the video five hours before it was uploaded to user-generated video website Vimeo. 'We wanted to make sure we got it out in time for Summer - so everyone could see it,' Mr Dann said. Relaxing after a long day: The four-member production team were able to enjoy a beer while watching the sun go down at Palm Beach . Well wishes: The Runaways Production House ended the video by wishing viewers a happy summer - with their video no doubt encouraging some viewers to get out and explore Sydney's beaches .","The four-strong production team travelled from Maroubra, in Sydney's east, to Palm Beach, in the north .

"Amid a swell of controversy, backlash, confusion and threats, Sony Pictures released The Interview online on Wednesday — an unprecedented counterstroke against the hackers who spoiled the Christmas opening of the comedy depicting the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. 'It has always been Sony's intention to have a national platform on which to release this film,' Sony Pictures chair and CEO Michael Lynton said in a statement. 'We chose the path of digital distribution first so as to reach as many people as possible on opening day, and we continue to seek other partners and platforms to further expand the release.' Scroll down for video . Sony Pictures released The Interview online on Wednesday — an unprecedented counterstroke against the hackers who spoiled the Christmas opening of the comedy . Kim Jong un-recognizable: A photo of Kim Jong-un in a full face of makeup is sweeping social media platforms as . The Interview became available on a variety of digital platforms on Wednesday afternoon, including Google Play, YouTube Movies, Microsoft's Xbox Video and a separate Sony website, a day after Sony and independent theaters agreed to release it in over 300 venues on Christmas. The wide digital release is the culmination of a set of deals that have been in the works since the major theater chains last week dropped the movie that was to have opened on up to 3,000 screens. Seth Rogen, who stars in the film he co-directed with Evan Goldberg, cheered the decision. 'I need to say that a comedy is best viewed in a theater full of people, so if you can, I'd watch it like that. Or call some friends over,' he tweeted. 'Thanks Sony for making it happen. Booyah,' he wrote in another tweet. James Franco added, 'Merry X-mas MERICA!!!!!!THE INTERVIEW IS LIVE!!!!!...Thank you SONY!!!!!!!!' A photo mocking North Korea's Supreme Leader has been sweeping social media in recent days along with the hashtag ‪'#‎YouCantSilenceOurFreedomOfSpeech‬.' The photo shows the stoic and stern Kim Jong Un with a full face of make-up. It has been splashed across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, and urges individuals to share, retweet or regram, 'for no other reason than to piss off North Korea.' Two tickets for The Interview on Christmas Day at the Los Feliz 3 Cinema in Los Angeles, California, after some changed its mind and released the comedy to independent movie theaters . Seth Rogen took to Twitter on Wednesday to share his delight that The Interview is now available online as well as getting a limited cinema run from Christmas Day . A Sony executive close to the matter said that there is concern over whether the company will recoup the $40 million cost of the film and the millions more spent on marketing, but that affordability and wide access were their main priorities. The executive also said more providers could sign on in the coming days and weeks and the option is still there for more theaters to show the film down the line. The executive said it remained an option for the major theater chains to show the film, and that Sony was working to repair the symbiotic relationship that has eroded in recent days. Regal, AMC, Cinemark, Cineplex and Carmike - who between them operate more than half of the country's 40,000 cinemas - had announced last Wednesday that they wouldn't be screening it. Decisions by Google and Microsoft to show the movie could open their sites to hacking. Microsoft reported technical problems with its Xbox sign-in system on Wednesday, though it wasn't known whether it was the result of hacking. Microsoft declined to comment. Sony's initial decision not to release the film was widely criticized, with President Barack Obama one of the harshest critics. U.S. officials have blamed North Korea for the hacking, and White House spokesman Eric Schultz said Obama welcomed the latest development. Rogen's co-star James Franco also took to social media to express his delight that the film has been released . 'As the president made clear on Friday, we do not live in a country where a foreign dictator can start imposing censorship here in the United States. With today's announcements, people can now make their own choices about the film, and that's how it should be,' Schultz said. Kim Song, a North Korean diplomat to the United Nations, condemned the release, calling the movie an 'unpardonable mockery of our sovereignty and dignity of our supreme leader.' But Kim said North Korea will likely limit its response to condemnation, with no 'physical reaction.' Among the early viewers was 11-year-old Marco Squitieri of Washington, D.C. Squitieri had wanted to see The Interview since seeing a preview earlier this year and had followed the news about Sony pulling the movie, then permitting its release. Squitieri's family purchased The Interview from Xbox for $14.99. 'It's pretty funny,' Squitieri told The Associated Press, laughing as he praised the chemistry of Rogen and Franco and adding that he could understand why the North Korean government wouldn't like it. 'They make fun of North Korea a lot.' The Interview will play in more than 300 U.S. theaters as of Christmas Day, after Sony reversed its decision to pull the film, after coming under criticism from President Barack Obama and others for caving into pressure from North Korea . Shut it down: The hack was an attempt to get Sony to cancel the release of their film The Interview, which depicts the assassination of Kim Jong-Un . Amy Hurley, an executive assistant who lives in Detroit, paid $5.99 to rent the movie on YouTube Movies and was disappointed. A fan of Rogen and Franco, she found Franco's character 'way over the top' and thought the jokes 'were old and kept going on and on.' 'It was kind of a mess overall,' said Hurley, 42. 'I was a little bummed because I was looking forward to seeing it.' The move to make the film available for rental and purchase before its theatrical release had never before been done with a mainstream film. Studios have released smaller indie and foreign movies simultaneously in theaters and on digital platforms, but analysts said the situation with The Interview left Sony little choice. 'This isn't being done because Sony wants to do it regularly, but rather out of necessity prompted by the exhibitor boycott,' said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter. Party guy: The film also depicts Kim Jong-Un as a party animal and ladies man . 'Sony is in a delicate situation here since they normally never go this route with a major film, but theater chains also know this is a unique back-against-the-wall situation,' added Gitesh Pandya, editor of BoxOfficeGuru.com. While Pandya said that interest would likely wane in January, for now, the curiosity and enthusiasm is still palpable. Tyler Pulsifer, manager of the Hartford Spotlight Theaters in Hartford, Connecticut, said he had received 32 calls from people interested in seeing The Interview during the first 90 minutes the theater was open on Christmas Eve. 'I'd be willing to bet we're going to sell out,' Pulsifer said. The theater has four showings on Christmas, and five each for Friday and Saturday nights. 'People want to see it because they've been told not to,' he said. For some, the decision to show the film hasn't been the smoothest process. Stephanie Putnam, assistant manager of the Greendale Cinema in Lawrence, Indiana, still isn't sure whether her theater will be able to show the movie on Christmas — it hasn't received it from the distributor yet. As a result, tickets haven't been on sale, but there have been several calls from customers who have expressed interested in seeing it. Releasing The Interview could potentially cause a response from the hackers, who called themselves the Guardians of Peace. There have been none of the embarrassing data leaks of Sony emails since the movie's release was delayed. In a message last week to the studio, the hackers said Sony's data would be safe so long as the film was never distributed. Lynton said the release represented the company's commitment to free speech. 'While we couldn't have predicted the road this movie traveled to get to this moment, I'm proud our fight was not for nothing and that cyber criminals were not able to silence us,' he said.","Sony Pictures released The Interview online on Wednesday in an unprecedented counterstroke against the hackers .

"Some of the families who were driven out of their houses in last winter's floods are finally home - just in time for Christmas. Hundreds of home owners were forced to abandon their houses on the Somerset Levels after record rainfall saw rivers burst their banks following years of insufficient dredging. More than 600 homes and 17,000 acres of farmland were inundated with quickly rising waters and entire villages were cut off after roads became unusable. Some of the families who were driven out of their houses due to the Somerset floods are finally home - Bryony Sadler is pictured in her finally dry home with grandma Julie Howell and  children Elsa and Toby . Now, several families have managed to make it home for the first time since they were evacuated. Among them are Gavin and Bryony Sadler, and their children, Toby and Elsa, who returned to the Old Vicarage in Moorland, Somerset, exactly nine months and two days after the devastating floods. Mrs Sadler, a leading member of the Flooding On the Levels Action Group, said: 'We've got young kids and it's been my paramount wish that we would get them back in time. 'Christmas is Christmas and you can see from the smiles on their faces that they are back home - we didn't need any more presents than that.' This aerial views shows Moorland on the Somerset Levels during last winter's 17,000 acres of flooding . The Sadlers' home was flooded by two and a half feet of water after the River Parrett burst its banks. 'We'll be replacing things for months to come, but the main thing is that we are back,' Mrs Sadler said. 'The children are much happier now they are home. 'Toby's school, Stoke St Gregory primary and the preschool that Elsa attends, the Willows Set, have been massively supportive. 'It has been so important for them to feel secure through all that has happened.' Following the devastation, which took place between December 2013 and March this year, 8,000 metres of river was dredged at a cost of £6 million. However, despite many making it home just in time for Christmas, dozens of families left homeless by the floods are still facing the festive period in temporary accommodation. Mrs Sadler stands among the debris left in her back garden  after the flood water  receded in March 2014 . This aerial view of Moorland shows no property in the village escaped unscathed following the flooding . They include Sally Vize, who is currently living in a mobile home at Church Farm, Moorland, while her house is being repaired. She was born in the farmhouse and this Christmas will be the first she has not spent in her home - but she remains stoical. 'I think everyone is in a better place now,' she said. 'They have started work on the house and we can see that things are moving on.' 'We have a shower here in the mobile home, but I do miss a bath, and I do wish I could dry the washing. 'But you just have to carry on.' Steve Parsons and his partner Alison are still camping out in a caravan beside their home at Fordgate. The house they bought as a family home is still drying out. Mr Parsons said: 'It was built in 1783 and it's got clay walls. It has been restored with lime plaster, but it just takes time to dry. 'Life in a caravan is a bit cold and damp but it was our choice, we wanted to be on site. 'I just felt with the problems some people have had that I wanted to be close to what was happening.' This picture, taken in March, shows some of the damage the flood inflicted on the Sadler's home in Moorland . But there will be no Christmas lights in the caravan this year. 'The electricity doesn't really run to that, and we can only run a certain amount of heaters,' Mr Parsons said. The partnership of authorities including district and county councils and the Environment Agency say they continue to make progress in delivering the 20 Year Somerset Levels and Moors Flood Action Plan. The plan includes improving infrastructure so that roads are more resilient as well as homes, to help protect businesses and residents. The Somerset Flood Relief Fund, launched by Somerset Community Foundation saw a national outpouring of goodwill which raised around £1.35 million. Justin Sargent, SCF chief executive, said last night that more than £1.1 million has been distributed, mainly to households and individuals, but also to provide other essential aid. He said: 'The main flood relief fund has still got funds remaining reserved for people still on their journey to get their home back up and running in a reasonable condition and to rebuild their lives. 'We are also working very closely with the Freemasons who have a separate fund with us which we invest in the community and projects which will help those affected such as village halls.' The restored village hall at Moorland, which received help from the masons' fund, is now a much-improved hub and is hosting church services while work continues on the church. Parishioners will celebrate Christmas there.","Families forced to abandon their homes after they were flooded last year .

"The driver of a tanker containing thousands of gallons of fuel spent two days in his cab after his satnav led him up a blind alley and the vehicle got wedged in a tiny country lane. An on-board GPS system linked to satellites gave the driver of the 40ft long tanker the wrong directions and he ended up stuck between two hedges on the road at Tutton Hill near the village of Colerne in Wiltshire. But despite his plight, the driver appeared to be perfectly happy to spend two days in his tanker - turning down an offer by police to take him to a hotel while they figured out how to remove the HGV and its gallons of fuel. Police were left scratching their heads for two days after a 40ft HGV got wedged between hedges in a narrow country road in Wiltshire and could not be moved, the driver of the tanker spent two days in the cab . A spokesman for Wiltshire Police said today 'We offered to take him to a local hotel but he said he could get provisions by walking to the village's Co-Op store, and he had a TV and heater in his cab.' The driver had been trying to deliver fuel at a nearby Ministry of Defence base when it got stuck. Officers were left scratching their heads for a solution to remove the tanker after recovery vehicles were unable to drag it clear when it rolled back down the hill and got wedged between the hedges, completely blocking the lane. They considered using a police helicopter and spent two days trying to work out how to remove it before they decided to remove some of the fuel to make the vehicle light enough so they could tow it. PCSO Shaun Redmond from Corsham police station said 'At one point we were considering using a police helicopter to try to release the tanker. 'Its size, weight and location meant it was proving a struggle to get it out  using our standard recovery trucks.' The truck was jammed between two hedges in Tutton Hill, near Colerne, Wiltshire (pictured) Meanwhile the driver of the HGV was left looking at the rolling hills and wildlife for two days. Wiltshire councillor Dick Tonge, who lives on Tutton Hill, said today 'It happens all the time so we are used to it. 'People follow their satnavs to cut through to get to the base, but I've never heard of one being stuck for two days before.' The police spokmesman added 'We want to remind HGV drivers to follow road signs and that Tutton Hill is unsuitable for HGVs.'","Tanker driver got stuck down a narrow country lane for two days .

"Piles of soiled and unusable goods dumped as 'donations' for charities are doing more damage than good, with Australians urged to think before they 'give away' their junk. Charities are set to lose millions of dollars this holiday season disposing of the worthless items people offload, as they create room for gifts and treats they receive over Christmas. For years, Lifeline's Gold Coast business manager Jim Dale has been picking up the pieces and this year he's bracing himself for the worst. He says Christmas time is when op shops receive the most donations of junk and this leaves him 'frustrated and disappointed' every year.

Australian charities are set to lose millions of dollars this holiday season disposing of these unusable items . 'We get a lot of broken, soiled and ripped items donated to us this time of year,' Mr Dale told Daily Mail Australia. 'They include clothing, mattresses, lawn mowers and once even had a transmission with oil in it. 'Majority of our donors are responsible but there's always that minority who leave us disappointed and frustrated.' Mr Dale says the process of removing the items are costly. 'It's quite expensive and here in the Gold Coast (southeastern Queensland) we've actually had to buy a second tip truck to help with the load. They cost more than $100,000 so they're not cheap.' In a recent incident, it took Mr Dale and other volunteers four hours to remove seven mattresses, three lounges, two dining tables and a dirty barbecue. Most of them had to be sent to the tip.

'Christmas is a hard time of year for many Australian families struggling with poverty, so donations of good quality goods are needed by the charities to raise funds so they can deliver their services. 'But giving un-useable or broken goods to a charity bin or op shop is not a donation - it is dumping waste and the cost of disposal of this rubbish takes away funds needed for the charities' community programs.' The National Association of Charitable Recycling Organisations is appealing to householders to make their donations of secondhand goods count this Christmas season: . · Ask yourself, would you give this item to a friend in need (ie it's clean, undamaged, good quality); . · Donate direct to the op shop during operating hours or call to arrange pick-up for larger items; . · Put rubbish and damaged items in your rubbish bin.","Charity op shops are urging householders to make their donations count this Christmas season .

"The patriarch of a Queensland family grieving after the alleged murder of eight children in Cairns has delivered a heartfelt public appeal for children to be cherished. Rod Willie faced the media in Cairns for the first time since the mother of seven of the children and aunt to another, Raina Mersane Ina Thaiday, 37, was charged with eight counts of murder. The four boys and four girls, aged between two and 14 years, were found dead in the home at Manoora last Friday. Scroll down for video .

The distraught father of the four youngest children massacred in Cairns could barely stand as he visited the memorial outside the home in which they were killed . Mr Willie - the grandfather of seven of the eight children - urged the public to band together during the Christmas period and 'hold dear such occasions with family and friends'. Families needed to regularly offer and seek loving support from one another, he said. 'Children are the most vulnerable of our society whose innocent lives deserve the greatest of love and care,' he said. 'Cherish them.' No date has been set for funeral ceremonies, but Mr Willie said the families would lay the victims to rest in Cairns early in the New Year. Gavin Willie was carried to the tribute site by family members on Sunday, screaming and crying in anguish . The unprecedented tragedy had directly affected multiple families, Mr Willie says. 'We are working carefully and respectfully as immediate families, extended families and as a community, through a sensitive and cultural process to ensure our loved ones are respectfully put to rest,' he said, according to statement circulated by police on Wednesday. 'Thank you for your patience and understanding as we work through a very difficult process.' He said those affected by the tragedy had been offered tremendous support from community leaders and organisations, individuals, agencies, and the private and corporate sectors. 'Our priority focus to date has been very much towards supporting our traumatised family members, to meet our cultural protocols and to begin to consider extraordinary funeral arrangements,' he said. On Sunday, the distraught father of the four youngest children massacred in Cairns could barely stand as he visited the memorial outside the home in which they were killed. It was a heartbreaking scene as family members - including the children's maternal grandmother (above) - made their way up to a tree where tributes had been left for the young vicitms . Gavin Willie was carried to the tribute site by family members on Sunday, screaming and crying in anguish as he clutched the flowers he had brought to lay in tribute to the eight children that lost lives. At one point Mr Willie collapsed to the ground, screaming the names of children, and had to be lifted by several men to a chair to be consoled by relatives. ‘Raiden’, ‘Rodney’, ‘Azza’ and ‘baby girl’, the father screamed over and over again in a rasping voice, while sobbing uncontrollably. Family members mopped at his forehead with a wet cloth, desperate to do something to help the father in his distress. Eventually they had to pick him up - his limbs hanging limp - and take him back to the family home to try and console him. Several men carried one of the fathers to the scene where he sat on a seat - weak and inconsolable . Family members sat and sobbed as they grieved the death of their beloved children . The grandmother of seven of the children who were killed wailed: 'No! No! My babies, my babies!' Family came to lay flowers at the memorial which they visited on Sunday morning .

She was supported by other family members as she wailed, ‘they’re my grandchildren’, and had to be helped to place a yellow rose among the tributes. A group of about 40 people - made up of the elderly, parents, young children and babies - were seen walking up the road, and were heard screaming and crying in distress and anguish. They clutched flowers as they stumbled down the street to add to the growing pile - a symbol of the immense grief in the community for the lost lives of the little children.

"A Florida woman was arrested two days before Christmas for knocking down a controversial Satanic Temple holiday display at the State Capitol. Susan Hemeryck, 54, of Tallahassee, tried removing the display showing an angel falling into the flames of hell with the message 'Happy Holidays from the Satanic Temple' Tuesday, and when the Capitol Police told her she couldn't, she began tearing it apart. She was arrested and charged with criminal mischief. The display had been erected as a satire by an atheist group from New York to counter a nativity scene, which was taken down the day the Satanic Temple installed theirs. Scroll down for video . Fallen angel: An angel ripped from a Satanic Temple display at the Florida Capitol sits on a table Tuesday in Tallahassee . Vandalism: John and Jean Porgal take photos of damage to a Satanic Temple holiday display they installed at the Florida Capitol Monday as a counter to a nativity scene that was set up by a Christian group . In the past, the Capitol has displayed a Pabst Blue Ribbon Festivus pole, atheist banners and even a tribute to the Flying Spaghetti Monster. 'It's just wrong, when you remove baby Jesus two days before Christmas and put Satan in his place — that just can't happen. I couldn't allow it to happen,' said Hemeryck, who said she was wearing a shirt that said 'Catholic Warrior' when she arrived at the Capitol. 'I was there at the right time and the right moment and I needed to take a stand against Satan.' Catholic warrior: Susan Hemeryck, 54, has been charged with criminal mischief for trying to tear down the atheist display, saying after her arrest that she should have done a better job of it . Atheist groups last year began taking advantage of the Capitol's free speech zone after a Christian group installed a manger scene showing the birth of Jesus. The display last year included a six-foot Festivus pole in tribute to a fake holiday created on Seinfeld that satirizes the commercialism of Christmas and a display by the Church of The Flying Spaghetti Monster, which mocks beliefs that a god created the universe and argues instead that the universe was created by a plate of pasta and meatballs. The Satanic Temple display was rejected as 'grossly offensive' last year, but this year — following threats of legal action from the Americans United for Separation of Church and State — the state Department of Management Services gave its approval. 'The angel's dead,' said John Porgal, regional director of American Atheists, when he arrived at the Capitol to see the angel figurine lying alone on a table. 'We've been tolerant of their display. We didn't like it, but we tolerated it. You see what they did to our display.' The Satanic Temple is a satirical group, also created by the atheists, that opposes religious displays and activity on government property and public schools. Porgal said he was not surprised someone had damaged the display, which he had installed in the Capitol just a day earlier. 'I was really surprised that it took this long,' he said. 'I was really expecting it to be damaged because of the religious part of our society.'

John Porgal, regional director of the American Atheists, second from left, talks with a Capitol Police officer after his mocking holiday display was torn down by a devout Catholic . Porgal said he plans to leave the display in its damaged state 'as a sign of what the religious right's idea of tolerance is.' Pam Olsen, who organized the manger display, said she doesn't approve of the attack. 'I'm actually very sad that she felt motivated to do that,' Olsen said. 'I do not like the display. I think it's rude and it's sad that he put it up to protest the nativity that means so much to millions of people, however I don't think anyone should ever vandalize anything.

"A Muslim terror leader whom the United States released from the Guantanamo Bay military prison camp in 2006 has sent at least 2,500 jihadis from Saudi Arabia and some from Yemen to join the self-proclaimed 'Islamic State' army in Syria and Iraq, according to a highly placed Pentagon source. That's more than twice the number of jihadi soldiers killed in U.S.-led coalition airstrikes over ISIS-held territory in Syria and Iraq. Ibrahim al-Rubaish, now the spiritual leader of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), was captured by American troops in 2001 and spent five years at 'Gitmo' before the George W. Bush administration released him into Saudi custody. 'There's no doubt that he's sending fighters,' the Department of Defense official told DailyMail.com on Wednesday. 'Twenty-five hundred is a conservative estimate.' SCROLL DOWN TO READ A SECRET GOVERNMENT FILE ON AL-RUBAISH . Ibrahim al-Rubaish was let go from Gitmo in 2006 along with 16 other prisoners, and quickly returned to al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula – becoming its Mufti, or spiritual leader – and he's now recruiting for ISIS . 'Caliphate Cubs': Some ISIS recruits are reportedly traveling with their young sons, who are then educated in madrassa-style military academies . 'The intel community as a whole is convinced he's [ISIS leader Abu Bakr] al-Baghdadi's link to Yemen,' he added. 'He manages to motivate a lot of Saudis too, even though he's persona non grata in the KSA,' he said, referring to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The official refused to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the information, and because he is not authorized to speak to the press. A second Pentagon official, lower-ranking but with knowledge of the Obama administration's tactical toolbox and Middle Eastern intelligence, confirmed the first source's account. 'That's correct,' he said in a phone interview when asked if al-Rubaish was sending large numbers of extremists to join ISIS. 'If we could get him back, we'd do it in a heartbeat. And there are more of them out there like him.' He said some Guantanamo detainees spend time behind razor wire building networks and strategic connections that become useful once the United States government repatriates them. 'It could happen during recreation time, even during prayer time,' the official explained. 'They're always plotting, and when someone like [al-] Rubaish is sent home he leaves with a mental Rolodex of people in the movement – everyone his fellow detainees ever worked with or made common cause with.' The Department of Defense wouldn't comment on al-Rubaish's ISIS recruiting, instead sending a generic statement recounting parts of his history. 'Ibrahim Al Rubaysh arrived at Guantanamo in 2002 and was transferred in 2006,' wrote Lt. Col. Myles B. Caggins III, a U.S. Army spokesman. 'Since 2009, the Defense Department and five government departments and agencies conduct thorough security and intelligence reviews prior to transferring Guantanamo detainees; more than 90 percent of detainees transferred during the Obama administration have resumed quiet lives in various countries.' 'I can't comment on behalf of security officials in Yemen or KSA,' he insisted. The Saudi government includes al-Rubaish on its list of most wanted terrorists, and the United States is offering a $5 million reward for information that leads to his capture. In 2009 the Jamestown Foundation, a terror-tracking think tank, identified him as AQAP's 'Mufti,' or chief religious authority in Saudi Arabia and Yemen. Al-Rubaish also has a college degree in Islamic shariah law. According to the Middle East Media Research Institute, Al-Rubaish called for open holy war against Americans in 2013, saying: 'It is my duty to spur the Muslims to kill the Americans, to get them out of the Muslims' land.' ISIS can muster up to 31,500 fighters, the Central Intelligence Agency reported in October. If that number is correct, al-Rubaish is responsible for mobilizing at least one out of every 13 ISIS fighters. But Fuad Hussein, chief of staff to Kurdish President Massoud Barzani, said a month later that the CIA and other intelligence agencies dramatically underestimated the total. Former President George W. Bush was under pressure in 2006 to release prisoners from Guantanamo, and did so a year after Vice President Dick Cheney warned against it . Pictured in 2002, the Guantanamo Bay military detention camp in Cuba became a repository for the worst terrorists captured after the 9/11 attacks in 2001, but the Bush and Obama administrations mostly emptied it . 'I am talking about hundreds of thousands of fighters because they are able to mobilize Arab young men in the territory they have taken,' Hussein told The Independent last month. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a nonprofit monitoring group, said Tuesday that it has counted 1,171 casualties and 800 wounded, mostly ISIS members, as a consequence of U.S.-led bombing raids. Thousands more have died during ground battles with the Iraqi Army and Kurdish Peshmerga forces. The Bush administration released more than 500 prisoners from Guantanamo, mostly by handing them over to other countries. President Barack Obama continued that trend, pledging during his 2008 political campaign to close 'Gitmo' completely. His most controversial Guantanamo releases were five top Taliban fighters whom he traded for the safe return of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl in May. Even then he acknowledged that that decision could come back to haunt the United States. 'Is there the possibility of some of them trying to return to activities that are detrimental to us? Absolutely,' he acknowledged three days later during a press conference in Poland. 'That's been true of all the prisoners that were released from Guantanamo,' Obama said. 'There's a certain recidivism rate that takes place.' The Obama administration is scrambling to track down al-Rubaish, whose Arabic name is spelled several different ways in English. The Pentagon insists that it continues to take precautions before releasing prisoners . PINPRICK? U.S.-led coalition airstrikes have killed more than 1,000 ISIS fighters, but al-Rubaish has sent more than twice that number into battle on his own . Nine years ago, then-Vice President Dick Cheney warned against emptying out Guantanamo for the same reason. 'If you were to release those 520 [detainees] that are currently held at Guantanamo that have been deemed to be enemy combatants, we're putting a lot of bad guys back on the street to do exactly what they started to do in the first place,' he said in 2005 at the National Press Club. A year later the Pentagon released al-Rubaish into a Saudi 'rehabilitation' program designed to reintegrate jihadis into society. He escaped and fled to Yemen, leaving his wife and three children behind. Now at the top of AQAP's religious pecking order, however, he has reportedly urged some of his ISIS-bound followers to bring their sons with them. 'You know there are little terrorist-training schools in Syria?' DailyMail.com's first Defense Department source said Tuesday. 'Those aren't all Syrian 10-year-olds. Foreign fighters from all over are traveling with sons. Mostly teenagers, but some are much younger.' The office of the Director of National Intelligence reported ni 2013 that 171 detainees Guantanamo prisoners released during the Bush years were confirmed or suspected of having re-engaged in hostilities. Judicial Watch, a center-right research organization known for collecting documents via Freedom of Information Act requests, first publicized on Monday that the U.S. State Department had offered a $5 million bounty for al-Rubaish. Tom Fitton, the group's president, said Tuesday that the AQAP Mufti stood as 'a dramatic illustration of the danger of releasing these terrorists.' 'The recidivism rate is dangerously high, and to release terrorists in the middle of ongoing wars in Afghanistan, the Middle East, is reckless,' he said. He said the Saudi program into which al-Rubaish was released 'had a recidivism rate of about 20 per cent.'

"Police confiscated plastic guns from a gang of 'toy soldiers' after they stormed into a Nando's restaurant. Shocked staff and diners watched as the group of men, painted green and wearing makeshift army uniforms, burst into Nando's in Chester and started doing military-style drills. Officers were called to the chicken restaurant on Bridge Street after hearing that the stag party were 'storming in and out' of shops and restaurants causing alarm to the public. Police confiscated toy guns from this group of revellers dressed as soldiers (pictured) after an incident in Nando's Chester . The men, who had all dressed up as the plastic miniature figurine soldiers, were spoken to by the officers and had their plastic weapons confiscated. The incident comes less than a month after counter terrorism officers met organisations, including Chester Zoo and Chester Cathedral, to urge them to step up security after the national terror threat level was raised to severe. Richard Ingham, manager at Nando's, said he was surprised to see the men come into the restaurant and start rolling around on the floor. 'We didn't know if they were street performers,' he said describing the moment the men, smothered in green paint, walked in on Saturday, December 20. Police received reports that the group, wearing makeshift army uniforms, were playing toy soldiers in shops and restaurants around Cheshire (pictured) The men had dressed up as plastic miniature figurine soldiers (toy pictured) complete with fake guns and green paint . 'They all lay down on the floor and started scrambling and doing all kinds of things.' One witness said: 'I saw them 'storm' Costa... they ran in shouting 'clear the area'. 'It was obvious to me that they were a stag party but I could see some people looked utterly confused.' The stunt divided opinion on social media. One member of the public commented: 'In bad taste considering the Sydney siege this week', while another said 'some people clearly have no sense of humour' adding 'it brightened up our day anyway'. A mother-of-four said the men had waved and even posed for a photo with her kids while she was stuck in traffic, saying 'all my children loved them' while others said they should have been arrested and one said it was 'lucky they hadn't been shot'. Cheshire Constabulary posted a statement on its official Facebook page, saying: 'Cheshire officers have been called to a report of males dressed as soldiers with guns 'storming' in and out of shops in Chester city centre. Cheshire Police, who posted that the group were causing 'concern to the public on Twitter, have spoken to the men and confiscated the fake guns . 'Whilst it was fairly apparent this was a case of ill-considered revelry the actions of those involved who were on a stag party night out have caused quite some concern to members of the public. 'Given the current terror climate, those involved really should have known better. The males have had the toy weapons confiscated and been appropriately advised. 'We want people to enjoy nights out, especially at this time of year, but we also want people to feel safe and to act responsibly.' Chester police sergeant Tony McGreary added: 'Officers were deployed in a proportionate manner to reassure the public and to speak to the men to prevent further concern.

"Travel review website TripAdvisor has been fined £392,000 by an Italian regulator after complaints from hotel owners about fake reviews on its pages. The Italian Competition Authority (ICA) ruled that people reading TripAdvisor Italy were unable to distinguish between genuine and fake reviews posted on the site. It said both were presented by TripAdvisor as ‘authentic and genuine in nature’. Travel review website TripAdvisor has been fined £392,000 by an Italian regulator after complaints from hotel owners about fake reviews on its pages . The fine follows a seven-month investigation by the regulator into whether the website takes appropriate measures to avoid publishing false opinions while presenting them as genuine. Founded in February 2000, TripAdvisor now claims to be the world's largest travel website, hosting millions of reviews from its community of users. It operates in 45 countries and is used by around 300 million people a month. The association says unscrupulous hotel owners sometimes leave false bad reviews of neighbouring competitors, which could skew holidaymakers’ decisions. In its response, TripAdvisor said it took aggressive action to fight fraud and had adequate systems in place to prevent it. Measures deployed by the website to fight bogus reviews include a team to detect fraudsters as well as automated tools and algorithms. The company said: ‘Our systems and procedures are extremely efficient in protecting consumers from a small minority of people who try to con our system. ‘We firmly believe that Tripadvisor is a force for good, both for consumers and the hospitality industry.’ Travel review website TripAdvisor operates in 45 countries and is used by around 300 million people a month . It complained that the Italian watchdog's ‘zero tolerance’ rules meant it would be liable to the same punishment even if just one review out of millions was deemed questionable. ‘From our initial review we believe that the ICA's recommendations are unwarranted and out of touch with commercial realities, not just of a user-generated content business, but of any company in any sector,’ it said. ‘The bottom line is, if people didn't find the reviews helpful, they wouldn't keep coming back to our site.’ However, the Federalberghi Italian hoteliers association, which was involved in the initial complaint against the website, alongside the country’s national consumer’s union, welcomed the decision. ‘We are happy with the decision by the antitrust authority, which goes in the right direction to offer greater protection for consumers and businesses,’ the group’s director-general Alessandro Nicara said. TripAdvisor says it take aggressive action to fight fraud and had adequate systems in place to prevent bogus reviews including automated tools and algorithms . TripAdvisor was investigated by the Advertising Standards Authority in 2011 and 2012 following claims from UK hoteliers that many of its reviews are fake. In 2012 the UK advertising regulator the Advertising Standards Authority ruled that TripAdvisor could not advertise all of its reviews as being genuine and the website subsequently scrapped its ‘reviews you can trust’ slogan and stopped claiming that its reviews are from ‘real’ travellers. Despite the elaborate systems it says are in place to detect fraudulent reviews, many have slipped through the net in recent years. Last year, a senior executive at one of the world’s biggest hotel groups admitted breaching rules last year by posting dozens of glowing reviews about the firm’s properties – and negative ones of its rivals. The reviews were only removed after Telegraph Travel contacted TripAdvisor. The website's fraud detection systems also failed to prevent a non-existent business becoming one of the most highly-rated restaurants in the popular seaside town of Brixham in 2013. And in March TripAdvisor’s came under fire over “alarmingly prolific” reviewers on daodao, its Chinese website. One member was found to have posted 2,633 reviews since 2010, while another had posted 1,361 reviews since October 2013, including 51 in Paris in a single month, during which time they also reviewed 50 other hotels in several other countries. Last month a couple were charged £100 by a hotel after they left a negative review of the establishment on TripAdvisor. The ‘fine’ was eventually refunded after a social media outcry.","Italian Competition Authority issued fine after  hotel owners complain .

"While limited-edition holiday drinks have become a festive tradition, many of them contain unhealthy levels of fat and sugar. But one high street chain has brought out a slimming one-calorie Christmas spicy coffee - so you actually lose weight just by drinking it. The Yuletide coffee is infused with flavours of Christmas candy, dried fruit and hints of pine and therefore needs no sugar, milk or syrup. Scroll down for video . Harris+Hoole's Yuletide coffee - which has only one calorie - is infused with flavours of Christmas candy, dried fruit and hints of pine and therefore needs no sugar, milk or syrup to sweeten it . The seasonal beverage is available at Harris+Hoole's 45 stores across the UK . With barely more than a calorie, the new coffee is available at Harris+Hoole's 45 stores across the UK. And as calories are burnt just in the act of drinking and digesting the coffee - you are using up more calories than are actually in the cup. This naturally fragrant coffee, cultured by one of Harris+Hoole's growers in Panama, uses the 'Honey process' to help keep the natural sugars from the coffee cherry. This means the coffee beans, which are a type of fruit, retain their sweetness, and the resulting drink needs no added syrup, toppings or cream to lend it such. Jochem Verheijen, head of coffee at Harris+Hoole, said: 'With overtones of candy, pine, the dried fruit of Christmas cake and even a whiff of wood smoke, everything in this filter coffee is reminiscent of the best bits of Christmas. 'The mastermind behind it, Graciano Cruz, is something of a God in the coffee world as his new process helps beans retain even more of their natural sweetness.' The result is a calorie-free Christmas coffee with flavours that speak for themselves. Mr Verheijen added: 'Christmas feasting is hard enough on the waistline. 'A coffee doesn't need to add to the calorie overdose by being packed with sugar. 'Just as you wouldn't use a fine bottle of plonk to make mulled wine, a coffee this good needs no added sugar.' A recent MailOnline study of high street coffee chain festive drinks found major brands like Costa Coffee and Starbucks had high sugar and high calorie contents. Out of 20 different festive drinks on sale at Starbucks, Costa Coffee and Cafe Nero, just four had less than a woman's daily recommended sugar intake of 25g (approximately five teaspoons). The worst offender - a Starbucks skimmed Honey and Almond Hot Chocolate with whipped cream - contained a 'shocking' 61g or 15 teaspoons - the equivalent to around two Mars Bars. A grande Honey and Almond Hot Chocolate from Starbucks - made with full fat milk and topped off with a frothy crown of whipped cream - contains 524 calories. This is a quarter of a woman's daily allowance (2,000 calories) and more than the 508 calories nestling inside a McDonald's Big Mac. Meanwhile seven of the skinny drinks - Starbucks' chai tea latte, Honey and Almond Hot Chocolate (without whip), Toffee Nut latte (without whip) and Peppermint Mocha latte (with whip), and Costa's Roasted Hazelnut, caramel and chai lattes - had more sugar than their full fat equivalents. The World Health Organisation recently reviewed its guidelines on how much sugar should be incorporated into a healthy diet. While it has previously recommended men consume no more than 70g and women 50g a day, those guidelines have been slashed to 35g and 25g respectively. This equates to no more than nine for men and six for women. Diets high in sugar can increase a person's risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and tooth decay. Dietitian Helen Bond told MailOnline while it is important for people to indulge in a festive treat at this time of year, they should be considered just that - a treat. The danger, she said, is that people popping into their local cafe will choose a tempting festive special and not realise the number of calories it contains. 'People go into coffee shops thinking, 'I'll just grab a coffee',' she said.","Harris+Hoole's Yuletide coffee beans are infused with Christmas candy .

"Investors have been treated to a Christmas bonus after more than £105billion was added to the value of Britain’s biggest companies in little over a week. The FTSE 100 index gained another 21.44 points yesterday to close at 6598.18. But it was not all good news as the pound fell against the US dollar, making holidays stateside more expensive for British travellers. Investors have been treated to a Christmas bonus after more than £105billion was added to the value of Britain’s biggest companies in little over a week (file picture) The FTSE has now jumped more than 400 points, or 6.7 per cent, in the last six trading sessions, adding £105.6billion to the value of blue-chip firms since early last week. The so-called ‘Santa Rally’, when the stock prices surge in the festive period, is good news for investors and workers saving for a pension who have money tied up in the markets. However, the FTSE is still below the 6743 it reached early this month before tumbling oil prices, the crisis in Russia, and fears over the eurozone sent it crashing to a year low. Sterling fell below $1.55 against a resurgent US dollar for the first time since August last year – a development that will make Christmas trips to America more expensive for UK travellers. Meanwhile stock markets in America soared to record highs last night as ‘astounding’ figures showed the United States economy growing at its fastest pace for 11 years. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average smashed through the 18,000 mark for the first time. In contrast, there were signs that the UK economy is slowing as the year comes to an end. Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed gross domestic product – the total size of the economy – rose by a healthy 0.7 per cent between July and September. The surge is good news for investors and workers saving for a pension who have money tied up in the markets (file picture) But that was lower than the 0.8 per cent growth seen in the second quarter of the year. Output was only 2.6 per cent higher than in the same period of last year, far less than the 3 per cent increase previously reported. The ONS report also showed the economy grew by less than expected in the previous five quarters meaning the recovery since early last year was weaker than thought. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ‘The stark revision in annual growth confirms that the pace of recovery is slowing.’ But analysts said the recent slump in the price of oil – a drop from $115 a barrel in June to below $60 last night – will breathe new life into the economy in 2015 as tumbling petrol prices leave households with more money to spend. Former Bank of England economist Rob Wood, now at Berenberg Bank, said: ‘The oil price rout is like a big tax cut for consumers, and UK consumers tend to spend extra income. ‘In our view, now is the time to be optimistic about the UK. A tax cut funded by Russia and the Middle East and falling mortgage rates should combine in a powerful cocktail that boosts UK growth next year.’ Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the Ernst & Young Item Club, said: ‘Looking ahead to 2015 the UK may experience some softening in growth. ‘However, the plunge in oil prices promises to provide the economy with renewed momentum, by improving household purchasing power and boosting global growth. ‘Overall, the chance that growth in output in 2015 could outpace 2014’s expansion cannot be ruled out.’ In the US, official figures showed the American economy grew at an annual rate of 5 per cent in the third quarter of the year – its best performance for 11 years.","Surge is good for investors and pension savers with money in the markets .

"Two best friends have sent each other the same Christmas card  for the past 36 years. Jackie Watson, of East Sussex, and June Monaghan, of West Sussex, have kept the tradition going since 1978, when Mrs Watson decided to play a trick on her friend. Instead of writing a new Christmas card, she popped the one she had received from Mrs Monaghan the year before back in the post with the  joke: 'Couldn't afford new cards this year.' When Mrs Watson sent the same card back again the following year, the festive tradition began. June Monaghan (left) and Jackie Watson with the Christmas card they have been exchanging since 1978 . The friends, now both 79, met as 25-year-olds working as BT telephone operators. The card, which depicts a snow scene of a dog with a robin perched next to its head, is now  worn and creased, but is full with good wishes from each year. It is now so full of messages that Post-it notes cover the inside so the friends can include their latest news and continue the tradition. Mrs Watson, of Peacehaven, East Sussex, said: 'It was just a silly joke on a simple card. We like a laugh, we know each other so well. 'It is now part of Christmas in our families. All our relatives want to know who's got the card that year and what's been written inside. 'We always post it, even though we don't live too far from each other, and luckily it's never been lost in transit. 'We wonder if we are the only people in the country or the world to do it and also if the length of time is a record.' The card, which features a dog holding a gun with a robin on the barrel, is now full of Post-it notes with the friends' messages from each year written on them . The messages are all dated and the pair say they hope the card never gets lost in the post . Each note is dated so the friends can track their progress. For example, their joy at the card lasting so long was clear in 1992 when Jackie said: 'Who would have believed '92?!' A note in 1994 was just signed: 'You'll never guess who.' The women worked together in Brighton, East Sussex, in the 1960s and, as neighbours, they would travel to work together. Their children went to the same school and they shared holidays together. Now they meet up regularly for lunch. Mrs Monaghan, of Lancing near Worthing, West Sussex, said: 'We've always been good friends and share the same sense of humour. 'We've travelled round the world together and the card is something we laugh about every year.' The friends, pictured in the 1990s, have been friends since they worked together in Brighton in the 1960s .","Friends met when they worked together at telephone exchange in 1960s .

"Northern Ireland's Attorney General, John Larkin, has directed new inquests into the deaths of people killed  in west Belfast in 1972 should be held . Northern Ireland's Attorney General John Larkin has directed that new inquests into the deaths of people killed by the army in west Belfast in 1972 should be held. Five people were killed in Springhill, Ballymurphy,  during the incident which became known as the Springhill Massacre. At the time of the incident the Troubles in Northern Ireland had been going on for three years – and hundreds of people on both sides had already been killed by the warring factions. The two clashing groups were Irish republicans wanting unification with the Republic of Ireland, and Ulster unionists, opposing Irish unification. The British Army had been deployed to keep the two groups apart but Nationalists complained about the army's heavy-handedness. Violence had been taking place all day on July 9 and the five dead were among ten people killed that day. There are two disputing versions of the events of that day, with a Provisional IRA statement released the day after the event claiming British army snipers opened fire on two cars, before shooting residents who rushed to the aid of the injured. The Army disputed this version of events and claimed its troops were fired on first by the IRA, ending a temporary IRA ceasefire. Now, Mr Larkin has directed inquests to be opened into the deaths of Margaret Gargan, John Dougal, David McCafferty and Patrick Butler. West Belfast MP Paul Maskey (pictured right with Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams) has welcomed the news . Sinn Fein West Belfast MP Paul Maskey said: 'The announcement by Attorney General John Larkin that inquests are to be held is welcome news for the families. 'The families have campaigned tirelessly for the truth and I commend their dignity and fortitude in bringing the campaign to this stage. 'The holding of the inquests is a step forward in getting to that truth and I hope that it will help bring justice to the families concerned.'","Five people killed in incident in Springhill, Ballymurphy in the Troubles .

"Britain was on festive flood watch today as the North West of England was covered in alerts ahead of Christmas Day. The Environment Agency had 35 flood alerts and four warnings in place this morning, with the Lake District and North Yorkshire the most at-risk areas. In addition, a Met Office yellow 'be aware' alert for ice is in place for Scotland and the uppermost parts of northern England today and tomorrow. Snow and wind warnings were also issued for Scotland and the North on Boxing Day and Saturday, and snow for Northern Ireland on Boxing Day. Two of the EA flood warnings, which are the most serious, were for the River Ouse at Naburn Lock and the River Ure at Roecliffe, both near York. Scroll down for video . Warnings: The Environment Agency has 35 flood alerts and four warnings in place, with Cumbria and North Yorkshire the most at-risk areas . Forecast: Tonight, scattered showers are likely to affect coastal Scotland alongside some Irish Sea and North Sea coasts . Weather warnings: A yellow 'be aware' alert for ice is in place for Scotland and the uppermost parts of northern England today and tomorrow . Be aware: A snow and wind warning is in place for Scotland and the North on Boxing Day and Saturday, as well as snow for Northern Ireland . Making up the total of four were warnings in Keswick, Cumbria, and Pimlico Brook at Clitheroe, Lancashire. The 35 flood alerts were mainly located in the North West and North East, although there was also a handful in the South and Wales. The Met Office told MailOnline today’s warmest temperature had already been seen at about 6am in London, at 12C, due to a cold air mass arriving. Tonight is expected to be as cold as 3C in the South and 2C in the North, with temperatures falling to -3C in Scotland overnight into Christmas Day. Christmas Day will see temperatures of 5C to 7C in the South, 4C to 6C in the North and 0C in Scotland, before it gets much colder into Boxing Day. Forecaster Dan Williams said: ‘We've got a fairly cold night  into Boxing Day. Northern England will be down to zero and in Scotland we could see -6C.’ What a glorious morning: An aurora is seen on the horizon behind Bamburgh Lighthouse in Northumberland today . Dramatic sky: An aeroplane vapour trails line the sky over Wimbleball lake in Exmoor National Park in Somerset today . Coastal life: A family on the beach enjoying the sunny weather on Christmas Eve in Southsea, Hampshire . He cautioned that a white Christmas was not on the cards, but said some sleet is possible in eastern Scotland and North East England coastal areas. Tonight, scattered showers are likely to affect coastal Scotland alongside some Irish Sea and North Sea coasts with some tracking further inland. Some of these may be wintry over high ground - but most other parts of the UK will have a dry and chilly night with lengthy clear spells. Many areas will have a dry and chilly Christmas Day with spells of sunshine, although showers will affect North Sea coastal areas and Irish Sea coasts. Some of these will drift further inland, and most of the showers will fall as rain - but they could turn wintry in places. Festive scene: Ice skaters today at Hampton Court Palace in East Molesey, Surrey . Dancing on ice: The sun shines through the trees as ice skaters enjoy the rink at Hampton Court Palace in Surrey . Quite a sight: Houseboat residents wake up to glorious sunrise after very heavy overnight rain at St Mary's Marina in Rufford, Lancashire . Sunrise: Roker Lighthouse and Pier in Sunderland on Christmas Eve morning. The pier has recently reopened after £850,000 of repairs . Meanwhile, Christmas was looking more wet than white in York yesterday but council chiefs said they were prepared to cope with any flooding. The Kings Staith and Skeldergate areas of the city centre were beginning to flood after recent heavy rainfall caused the levels of the River Ouse to rise. The Environment Agency said no major issues were expected in the city, but the council said it was ‘well equipped’ to deal with any problems. Boxing Day will have a fine and frosty start, before cloud will tend to increase from the west through the day with a freshening southerly wind. Rain will spread in from the west through the afternoon, falling as snow initially over the Pennines and Scottish hills. Any sign of Santa? Real radar data and radio transmissions from Christmas Eve last year shows what might be happening in the skies tonight . Saturday then looks set to be very unsettled with rain giving way to heavy showers, these potentially wintry in places. BBC Weather said the warmest place in the UK yesterday was Gravesend, Kent, at 13.7C, while the coldest in the day was 4C at Lentran, Highlands. The wettest place yesterday was Shap in Cumbria with 1.3in (33mm) of rain, and the sunniest was Kinloss in Moray, Scotland, which had 4.7 hours. In the US, storms in the South yesterday killed at least four people, damaged homes, businesses and cars, and knocked out power to thousands. It appears spring is already here, as Mother Nature responds to the mild weather with an early show of flowers. Daffodils are in full bloom on a grass verge in the North Devon village of Instow, and locals claim they have sprung from bulbs planted a decade ago. And in the Berkshire village of Inkpen, residents are admiring primroses in bloom and snowdrops poking. 'Planted a decade ago': Daffodils are in full bloom on a grass verge in the North Devon village of Instow . Grandmother Sue Hardy, 62, said: ‘There are several grass banks along the roads where the primroses have emerged - It's incredible.' And in nearby Kintbury, villagers have reported seeing bumblebees flying along hedgerows and in gardens in the spring-like temperatures. But wildlife experts are warning the current warm weather could spell disaster for hibernating creatures. If butterflies and hedgehogs are lured out of their winter quarters by the warmth, they will die in a sudden cold snap if they cannot find a new home. All quiet on the roads but airports are a different matter . It has been a quiet start to Christmas Eve on the roads and railways, with many workers taking the day off. Airports were busy though, with flights full with some of the four million people who are heading abroad over the period December 19 to January 3. Main line trains and Tubes were far less crowded than usual, with the Highways Agency reporting no major hold-ups on England’s motorways and A-roads. Deserted: Cars drive on the M4 near Heathrow Airport today, on what has been a quiet start to Christmas Eve on the roads and railways . Quiet day for traffic: Cars drive on the M25 motorway near Heathrow, with many workers taking the day off . And after weeks of almost daily disruption to morning rush-hour trains, rail delays were restricted to minor ones in East Anglia. Gatwick Airport in West Sussex presented travellers with a complete contrast to last Christmas Eve, when flooding led to a power outage which caused delays and cancellations. Passenger Rhiannon Morton tweeted: 'It’s so Christmassy in Gatwick today. Santa, frosty the snowman, a giant snow globe.' Also impressed was Nicola Keleher, who tweeted: 'Gatwick Airport South Terminal looks super busy today but loving all the entertainment, singers & the amazing polar bear.' The top winter sun destinations for Britons heading abroad include the Canary Islands, Tunisia and Morocco, while top long-haul destinations include Dubai, Mexico, Cuba and Egypt. British Airways’ schedules include 267 flights on Christmas Day, on which 37,000 turkey dinners will be served. Top BA destinations over the festive period are Dubai, Barbados, New York, Australia and Barcelona. Ryanair is carrying more than 3.5 million customers between December 20 and January 6 - an increase of 500,000 on the 2013/14 holiday period. Going on a winter holiday: Passengers queue to drop off their bags at Terminal 5 of London Heathrow Airport, for their Christmas getaways . EasyJet has had to cancel some Boxing Day flights due to a strike by French cabin crew. However, none of the affected services depart from or arrive in the UK, with all of them being within France. Rail travellers are having to contend with disruption caused by a £200 million engineering programme over the holiday period. Although a lot of the work, being carried out by an army of 11,000 rail engineers, is being done on Christmas Day and Boxing Day, there will be major disruption on the West Coast Main Line due to work at Watford in Hertfordshire and between Stafford and Crewe. The West Coast line will be shut between Euston station in London and Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire after the last trains on Christmas Eve until December 29. It will also be closed between Stafford and Crewe after the last trains today until December 28. Heading west: Passengers travelling through Paddington station in London on Christmas Eve . Packed and ready: Train passengers look at departure boards before boarding trains at London Paddington station on Christmas Eve . Also, work at Reading in Berkshire will mean restricted services in and out of Paddington station in London right through to January 5. A 16-day part-closure of London Bridge station for work involving the £6.5 billion Thameslink programme started last Saturday. From December 20 to January 4, Southern and Thameslink trains are not calling at London Bridge. The other piece of work that will extend beyond Boxing Day is at a spot just outside King’s Cross in London. This will restrict services on December 27 and 28. National Express has announced record demand for its coaches this Christmas, with this Saturday the most popular day to travel. Another bus company, First Bus, said it would be running a record number of services on Boxing Day when it would be carrying around 250,000 passengers.","Environment Agency has 35 flood alerts and 4 warnings in place, with Cumbria and North Yorkshire most at-risk .

"A California woman was reunited with her classic Ford Mustang nearly 30 years after it was stolen, when a man tried to register the muscle car at a Department of Motor Vehicles office. Lynda Alsip said she couldn't ask for a better Christmas present than the return of her  1967 Mustang, The Monterey County Herald reported on Monday. 'I never thought I would see it again,' she told the newspaper. 'It's like winning the lottery. It happens to very few people and for it to happen to me, it's just an amazing feeling.' Scroll down for video . Reunion: Lynda Alsip is seen sitting inside her 1967 Ford Mustang at California Towing in Salinas, California on Tuesday . Present: The vehicle, Alsip's first car, was stolen from her 28 years ago and was recently recovered by the California Highway Patrol . Alsip was 17 when she purchased the vehicle in 1985 for $800 - and the muscle car was stolen approximately twelve months later outside the apartment complex she lived in, the newspaper reported. Police say the vehicle was found at the Department of Motor Vehicles in Salinas in September when a man tried to register the car he had for 23 years. Authorities are looking into if the man knew the Mustang was a stolen vehicle, The Monterey County Herald reported. 'It had been out of the system for so long that it came back with no file,' California Highway Patrol Officer Jaime Rios told the newspaper. 'The officer did some digging and found out the car was stolen in 1986 from Salinas.' 'It's astonishing that it has stayed here,' Alsip told The Salinas Californian. 'For so many years and not so far away. I wonder how many times I might have driven past the house or been in the area?' 'At first I didn’t think it was going to be a happy call,' she told The Monterey County Herald. 'None of my kids were home, and both are at a driving age. But then [Officer Chris Menchen, who researched the car] asked me if I had ever had my car stolen and I immediately thought: ""Oh my god! You found my green 1967 Mustang!""' According to the newspaper, Alsip's now-deceased father assisted with the money to buy the car in 1985. Alsip told the media outlet his reaction to the found vehicle would have been 'Only you, kid.' 'He taught me how to change the oil in vehicles on this car,' she told NBC Bay Area. He’s no longer with us, so it’s very bittersweet.' Alsip, who now lives in the central California valley town of Hollister, plans to have some work done on the car then show off her original personalized license plate, 'LYNDA67,' The Monterey County Herald reported.

"A Japanese artist who makes objects such as phone cases, kayaks and picture frames shaped like her own vagina has been charged with distributing 'obscene' data. The charges follow Megumi Igarashi's arrest this month after she raised funds online to pay for a genital-shaped kayak which she made on a 3D printer. The 42-year-old was first arrested in July, but was freed after several days following a legal appeal and after thousands of people signed a petition demanding her release. Scroll down for video .

Igarashi creates a range of products that look like her vagina, including picture frames (left) and phone cases (right) Igarashi (pictured) is facing up to two years in jail or a fine of 2.5million yen (£13,000) if found to guilty of breaching Japan's strict obscenity laws . But Tokyo police arrested her again this month -- along with sex shop owner Minori Watanabe, 44, also a writer and feminist activist, for 'displaying (Igarashi's) obscene goods in her shop window'. Ms Watanabe, whose boutique is aimed at women, was later freed after prosecutors failed to persuade a judge to sanction extended questioning. Takeshi Sumi, Ms Igarashi's lawyer, said: 'We don't agree with the prosecutors' contention at all. 'We will continue pleading not guilty on behalf of Igarashi, who argues her works are not anything obscene.' The Japanese court approved her detention, as prosecutors said they feared she would destroy evidence if released, according to Sumi. The present charges relate to three counts of distributing 'obscene' data -- namely CD-ROMs containing computer code for a 3D printer that would allow users to make copies of the vagina-shaped kayak. Japan's multi-billion-dollar pornography industry is large and varied, but obscenity laws still ban pictures of actual genitalia, which normally appear pixellated or behind black spots. If convicted of distributing or possessing obscene materials for the purpose of selling, she could face up to two years in jail and/or a fine of as much as 2.5million yen (£13,000).

"A Seattle Seahawks super-fan got the ultimate thank you gift just in time for Christmas after helping  a friend of Robert Turbin, Seahawks running back, earlier this year. In a YouTube video, Alex Hughes's eyes were filled with tears  after he opened the mystery package bearing the Seattle Seahawks logo. The package contained every football fan's dream: a helmet signed by every player on his favorite team. 'Are you kidding me? This is so awesome,' Hughes exclaimed as he held the autographed helmet in his hands. Scroll down for video . Gift: Seattle Seahawks fan Alex Hughes posted a YouTube video of him and his son opening a gift from Seahawks running back Robert Turbin . Tears: Here, Hughes is seen holding the helmet as tears well up in his eyes, his son in the background holding a pair of scissors . 'Awesome:' Hughes said 'this is so awesome' before leaning on the ground and wiping the tears from his eyes . A little more than a month earlier, Hughes traveled to Kansas City to watch his beloved Seahawks play against the Kansas City Chiefs. Hughes told Komo News that he was decked out in his Seahawks gear when he and his friends went bar-hopping the night before the game. Hughes said that he had been heckled all night as tensions were high while football fans anticipated the big game -- the Chiefs won the game with a final score of 24 to 20. 'This girl walks up to me and says, 'Hey, can I try your jacket on real quick?' Hughes said. Autograph: Hughes encountered Turbin's girlfriend who asked to take a photo in Hughes' jacket, the two then planned to meet up so Hughes could get his '12th Man' flag signed by the runningback . Disappointment: He tried to meet up with the woman as the two had planned, but Hughes' phone died and after nearly an hour of searching for the team's bus in the freezing cold weather, Hughes gave up and left . But the Oklahoma father was wary of the woman's request, thinking she might be trying to take his jacket. The woman told Hughes she wanted to take a photo in the jacket to send to her boyfriend, Seahawks running back Robert Turbin. When Hughes asked her to prove she was dating the player, the woman showed him text messages on her phone and a photo of Turbin on her Instagram page, according to Komo. Hughes decided to believe her. After the photo, the two arranged to meet up after the game so Hughes could get an autograph from the player. But Hughes' phone died and after nearly an hour of searching for the team's bus in the freezing cold weather, Hughes gave up and left as his friends teased him saying he had been tricked. Son: In the video, Hughes opens the package with help from his son who exclaimed 'you won it, daddy! You won it!' after seeing the helmet . Robert: Robert Turbin is a running back for the Seattle Seahawks, the player was drafted in the fourth round of the 2012 NFL Draft . A week after the encounter,  the mystery woman messaged Hughes on Instagram and asked for his address, according to Komo. Three weeks later, a box marked 'Seattle Seahawks' was on his doorstep. In the video, Hughes opened the package with a little help from his son. With tear-filled eyes, Hughes looked incredulously at the helmet as his son said 'you won it daddy! You won it!' Hughes told Komo that he has the helmet in a case, on display in his son's room. 'I was just happy to get anything... and then to get this with 30 signatures on it...' Hughes said. 'I just imagine Robert taking the time for some stranger to walk around his locker room and bug his friends to sign some thing for some guy in Oklahoma - that's incredible that you could have a job that can make somebody that happy.'","Seattle Seahawks superfan Alex Hughes got the ultimate thank you gift from Seahawks running back Robert Turbin just in time for Christmas .

"Hundreds of survivors of a brutal rebel attack that killed at least 63 people in northeastern India sought shelter Wednesday in a church and school while security forces imposed a curfew in a bid to contain the latest bout of ethnic violence. Long-simmering land and ethnic disputes in Assam state erupted in bloodshed Tuesday when authorities said rebels belonging to a faction of an indigenous separatist group called the National Democratic Front of Bodoland attacked tribal settlers known as Adivasi. Most of the Adivasis, whose ancestors migrated to Assam more than 100 years ago, have worked on tea plantations. Indian tribal settlers in Assam take refuge in a local school after their village was attacked by an indigenous separatist group called the National Democratic Front of Bodoland . A woman and her child arrive at a hospital in the Sonitpur district of Assam after being caught up in the violence . At least 100 people, mostly women and children, sought refuge in a church in Shamukjuli village in Sonitpur district, where 26 of the victims died. Another 200 people ran to a nearby school. The Adivasis are a mix of Hindus and Christians and many had been preparing for Christmas when the attack took place, survivors said. Bodo rebels have been fighting for a separate homeland for their indigenous tribe, which makes up 10 percent of Assam's 33 million people. They have staged attacks against both Adivasi and Muslim settlers in violence that has left at 10,000 people dead, most of them civilians, in the last three decades. In May, the same rebels group shot and killed more than 30 Muslims. Many of the dead in Tuesday's attacks included women and children, police said. The rebels may have been provoked by heavy losses they suffered recently as police intensified operations against the group, Singh said. 'We are trying to ensure that ethnic violence does not flare up,' he said, adding that a curfew was imposed in two districts and police and paramilitary forces patrolled the area. There were concerns the violence could spill over. Following the attacks, angry Adivasis surrounded a police station in Sonitpur and attempted to attack the officers inside, said S.N. Singh, a top police official. Police opened fire, killing three Adivasis, he said. An injured person is treated at a hospital in Kokrajhar district, in northeast state of Assam, India, following an attack by Bodo separatists .

Tribal men with their bows and arrows walk towards houses belonging to Bodo community people after they were set on fire in revenge for attacks that left 63 dead . Rebels gunned down at least 37 Adivasi, or tribal settlers, in Sonitpur district and 15 others in Kokrajhar . He also said there were incidents of Bodo homes being attacked, but troops managed to control the situation. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi condemned the latest attacks, and the Home Ministry rushed several thousand federal paramilitary troops to the region, junior Home Minister Kiren Rijiju said. Dozens of rebel groups have been fighting the government and sometimes each other for years in seven states in northeast India. They demand greater regional autonomy or independent homelands for the indigenous groups they represent. The rebels accuse the federal government of exploiting the region's rich mineral resources but neglecting the local people.

"A major operation has been launched tracking Santa Claus as he makes is annual delivery of presents to all the children who have been good over the past year. Santa left his top-secret toy factory deep underneath the North Pole several hours ago, with Rudolf leading the reindeer on their trip around the world. International aircraft have been warned to steer clear of the North Pole as Santa Claus dashes around the world at almost the speed of light. Scroll down for video . Volunteers are busy working on the phones dealing with questions from children over Santa's location . Hundreds of highly trained experts follow the live action on a big screen normally used by the US Air Force . Central to the tracking operation is the North American Aerospace Defense Command, who have been following Santa's movements from space since 1955. Before the invention of satellites, ground observers had to try and spot the reindeer-powered sleigh as it shot across the night-time sky. NORAD is especially busy on Christmas Eve and has brought in volunteers in order to field hundreds of phone calls, emails and tweets from anxious children, wondering what time Santa will arrive. Also parents and guardians want to ensure that their children are in bed before Santa arrives so he stops and makes his much-anticipated delivery. This year, NORAD has launched a live-feed of Santa's journey from a special satellite which is able to keep up with the Mr Claus as he hurtles across the night sky. The 59-year-old program is based at a special Santa nerve centre at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs. In December 1955, children discovered a phone number for the top-secret NORAD facility and rang officers who routinely passed on detail's of Santa's progress. Santa Claus pictured earlier today, said he was making deliveries to everyone who had been good . Pilots have been warned to avoid the area around Santa's top-secret workshop for the rest of the day . At 2pm GMT Santa was spotted in the middle of Australia before heading north east to Papua New Guinea . The volunteers will work for 23 hours today following Santa, before racing home just in time for the delivery of their own presents. By lunchtime today, the Santa Tracker had more than 1.5 million likes on Facebook with more than 19.5 million people visiting the website. Major Beth Castro, who is in charge of communications between Santa and the children said in 2012, 22.3 million people logged onto the website. This year, the website features an animated elf named 'Radar'. Normally the NORAD facility is responsible for defending the skies of the United States and Canada and was originally located deep within Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado Springs. Pilots flying near the North Pole have been advised to avoid the area for the whole of Christmas Eve. A special pilot map produced by Jeppesen warned air crew that: 'Departures may be illuminated by a blinding red nose. The notice also warns of 'supersonic heavy departures' and that 'non-sleigh traffic discouraged'. Pilots are also warned that 'reindeer and elves on and in the vicinity of the runway'. British Airways Captain, David Thomas, said: 'Santa has absolute priority over the skies on Christmas Eve and we’ll be cheering him on. 'There will be 28 British Airways aircraft flying tonight to the four corners of the world, so we’ll be telling our customers to look out for the sleigh and to give Santa and his reindeer a wave.'

"Living in fear of a partner or family member does not stop over Christmas . It’s a time for family gatherings, celebrations and present-giving. However, excessive alcohol consumption and money worries over Christmas contribute to a peak period for domestic abuse. For thousands of women, men and children up and down the country, the festive period remains a time where their own home is not safe. Living in fear of a partner or family member does not stop over Christmas, and statistics reveal incidences of domestic violence increase over the holidays. During the last quarter of 2013, there was a 15.5 per cent rise in victims suffering abuse at home. And it is estimated that one in four women will experience domestic violence in their lifetime. In the UK, two women are killed every week by a current or ex-partner, and many police forces across the UK see a spike in reports around Christmas. Sandra Horley CBE, chief executive of national domestic violence charity Refuge, says: 'Christmas can be an incredibly difficult time for women and children experiencing domestic violence. ‘Christmas is meant to be a time of joy, a time of generosity, a time of caring. But for too many women and children, the 25th December will be yet another day of living with fear, intimidation and violence.' The physical, economic, and psychological abuse suffered by victims of domestic violence can make it incredibly difficult for victims to leave. Isabel*, 35, explains how she was a ‘successful, independent businesswoman’ when she first met her ex-husband Mark, who started being violent to her when she fell pregnant. 'I wasn't sure about him at first, but he pursued me relentlessly, charming me with gifts, flowers and surprise trips abroad,’ she said. Christmas is a peak time for domestic violence, according to statistics . 'He was at the top of his profession and he bowled me over. 'He wanted to get married and have children straight away. It was exciting and romantic - I thought I had met the love of my life. 'It's only now, looking at back at the whole picture that I can see that this was controlling behaviour and his inability to take no for an answer. 'After we had moved in together, he kept starting arguments. I put it down to the stress he was under at work. Sandra Horley CBE, chief executive of national domestic violence charity Refuge, says: 'Every couple has arguments and disagreements – we all say and do things we later regret. 'Domestic violence is systematic, purposeful and patterned behaviour designed to control another person. 'If a woman is forced to change her behaviour because she is frightened of her partner's reaction, then she is being abused. 'Domestic violence can be physical, emotional, psychological, financial or sexual. 'Abuse tends to become more frequent and more severe over time; even if you are not being hit, you may still be being abused. If your partner is excessively jealous or possessive, or if he controls where you go, who you speak to, how you dress or wear your hair, these are all warning signs of domestic violence.' ‘We had been together for about a year when one of these rows ended with him threatening me with a kitchen knife. ‘I decided to leave him, but when he agreed to go to relationship counselling, I gave him another chance.' Like many abusers, Mark began isolating Isabel and making her economically reliant on him, encouraging her to leave the business that she ran with a colleague. She said: 'The moment the business had a bad time he was encouraging me to sell up and leave it, promising he would take care of me and support me. ‘There were subtle pressures to force me under his economic control and take away my independence.’ 'The next year, we got married and I fell pregnant. That was when the violence started. 'We were arguing after we had missed our flight for a holiday. Suddenly he hit me and threw me across the room.' As with many cases of abuse, the violence outburst was not a one-off, and Mark became increasingly abusive towards Isabel. 'Throughout the pregnancy, I had to explain away the bruises from his punches and kicks. I told the midwife I had fallen down the stairs,’ she said. 'Anything could set off a violent outburst from Mark. I was constantly walking on eggshells. 'But whenever I tried to leave, he would reel me back in, telling me that he would change and that he wanted us to be a family.’ Emotionally manipulated and abused by Mark, Isabel felt unable to leave him and isolated from friends and family. Arguments can often happen in front of the children - and escalate out of control . 'They [abusers] are very clever. He made me believe it was things I was doing wrong that was setting him off. 'After the birth of our second child he had a massive falling out with my family and gave me an ultimatum; him or them. We had just had a baby and I was desperate to keep the family together. So I was totally alone. 'The violence was sporadic and I began to question whether I was causing it. I didn't have the term domestic abuse in my head at all. ‘It sounds silly but I thought domestic abuse meant having a black eye. Because I wasn't turning up at the school gate covered in bruises everyday it wasn't domestic violence.' Despite his promises to change, Mark became worse after the birth of the couple's second child. For more information visit www.refuge.org.uk . 'One day a normal conversation suddenly turned into a frenzied attack,’ Isabel explained. ‘He punched me to the ground, kicked me in the back, and then threw me across the room - all in front of our two-year-old and the baby.' It was only after this incident in the presence of the children that Isabel called the police. However, it took several more attacks and calls to the emergency services before Isabel found the strength to leave permanently, getting legal help to set up restraining orders. 'The police were not very supportive, it was like they were just ticking things off their check list and rolling their eyes,’ she said. 'Eventually the police put me in touch with Refuge. One of their outreach workers, Anna*, started helping me. 'The very act of being believed allowed everything to just come pouring out. 'We talked about everything I had been through and she helped me to understand that Mark's behaviour was all about power and control. Just that initial emotional support was so important. 'But then she also calmly helped talked me through the practicalities, navigating the next stage. With her support, I made a plan to stay safe. 'Anna supported me as I went through the divorce and child contact proceedings. Thanks to her I was able to start rebuilding my life away from Mark. 'I was devastated when the crown prosecution service said there wasn't enough evidence to prosecute him, but I have had to move on. 'Now things are so much better. It isn't easy to break away from a violent partner; I don't think I could have done it without Refuge's support. ‘I would urge anyone who is living with fear and intimidation at home to visit Refuge's website and find out more - you are not alone and there is life on the other side of domestic violence.' Sandra Horley CBE, chief executive of national domestic violence charity Refuge, said: 'People often ask, “Why do women stay with violent men?”. 'The answer is complicated. There are a huge number of practical and psychological barriers to leaving an abusive partner. 'Victims of domestic violence are frequently isolated by their abusers: systematically cut off from friends and family. It can be incredibly hard for women to reach out for help in situations like this. If a woman is forced to change her behaviour because she is frightened of her partner then she is being abused. This list may help you to identify whether you are experiencing domestic violence: . 'The grinding impact of emotional abuse can chip away at a woman's sense of self. She may begin to believe her abuser when he tells her, day in, day out, that she is worthless, that no-one will believe her, that no-one cares about her but him. 'Abusers manipulate their victims carefully and purposefully; they switch readily between charm and rage, like Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. 'Fear can be a paralysing force: many women stay with their abusers because they are terrified of what will happen if they leave. This is a well-founded fear. Domestic violence takes a staggering death toll, killing two women every week, and the vast majority of domestic homicides happen when a woman is trying to separate from her abuser. 'Some women may not be able to support themselves and their children financially on their own. Refuges and other support services are being closed across the country as a result of ongoing funding cuts – reducing the number of escape routes available to women and children. 'Domestic violence will not end unless we stop asking “Why does she stay?” and instead ask the right questions: “Why does he abuse?” and “What can we do as a society to end domestic violence once and for all?”.’' * Names have been changed.","Christmas is a peak period for domestic violence attacks, figures show .

"MPs have been urged to scrap their multi-million pound lunch subsidy amid fury at the cut-price Christmas lunches being offered in Parliament.

The meals are able to be offered for way below the going rate because taxpayers subsidise Parliament's restaurant and bars to the tune of £3million a year. Scroll down for video . Parliamentary authorities insiste that bills have been reduced by hundreds of thousands and prices in bars and restaurants have been increased to reduce the burden on the public purse . The Strangers' Dining Room - used by members to wine and dine guests - is serving chargrilled spatchcocked partridge with roast pear, squash and game chips for £9.25. Just a mile away from Parliament, ordinary members of the public have to pay £25 to dine on a roast leg of Partridge. Another seasonal item at the restaurant is the roast Norfolk turkey breast wrapped in smoked pancetta with piccolo parsnips, baby sprouts, chestnut stuffing, cranberry gel and bread sauce foam for £12. The fish menu includes confit halibut with lemon verbena, Anna potatoes, baby fennel, golden raisins and verjus for £15. In the Portcullis Cafeteria main courses include braised guinea fowl breast with baked fig and celeriac rosti with ginger sauce for £4 and baked fillet of salmon in puff pastry with a rich tomato sauce, roasted cherry tomatoes and basil for £4. At the Debate restaurant Christmas specials include grilled salmon fillet marinated in vodka and dill with vegetable tinsel for £4. The Churchill Dining Room offers salt-baked celeriac with pea velouté, poached hen's egg, puffed potato, toasted panko and popcorn shoots for £10. Parliamentary staff can also make use of the daily roast at the Members' Dining Room, where the fare includes traditional roast turkey with stuffing, pigs in blankets and cranberry sauce and mustard and honey glazed gammon with parsley sauce and sage and onion pudding . Peers are angry that ordinary office workers are now allowed to dine with them and have attacked the quality of dining, it emerged last month. They also rejected a plan to merge dining with MPs, fearing the quality of champagne would suffer. MPs have been urged to end the £7million a year subsidy for food and drink in the House of Commons . A spokesman for the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'Turkeys don't vote for Christmas but MPs should certainly vote to scrap the subsidised food and drink in Parliament. 'Everyone loves a festive lunch, but the Christmas menu in Parliament highlights the generous taxpayer subsidies that still exist there. 'With many people tightening their belts this Christmas it's time these out-of-date subsidies were axed.' Lords have their own set of restaurants and have resisted plans to merge their catering with the Commons, fearing the quality of champagne might suffer. The cost of food and drink at Parliament costs taxpayers about £3million a year. A spokesman for the House of Commons said: 'The House of Commons Catering Service provides catering to over 10,000 people who work on or visit Parliament, including MPs, their staff, House staff, civil servants, contractors, journalists and members of public. 'Much of the net cost to the House arises because of the irregular hours and unpredictability of Parliamentary business. Good progress has been made over the years to reduce the cost of catering. 'The budget for the current financial year, 2014-15, is for the net cost of catering services to be under £3million.'","Taxpayers subsidise Parliament's restaurant  to the tune of £3million a year .

"They are a trademark of the Islamic State terror group. Slickly produced propaganda videos, filmed with high definition cameras. Now it has been revealed that an Australian university student is behind many of the packages broadcast around the world, which often feature barbaric threats to Westerners. In an interview with The Australian newspaper, an unnamed former electrical engineering student from Sydney said he had witnessed beheadings during his time working for the Islamic State. But he described his life as fairly typical. 'I have a job, I live in a HQ, eat, sleep, work, hope an airstrike gets me so I can be Shaheed (martyred). Pretty typical life,' he told the newspaper. Australian militants are in front of the camera and behind the scenes: Abdullah Elmir, 17, from western Sydney, has featured in IS propaganda videos and it was revealed today an unnamed Sydney man is working behind the scenes to produce the terror group's packages . Slick production values: The Islamic State has shown a penchant for producing high-quality propaganda videos, often featuring HD cameras and elaborate costuming . It is unknown who is responsible for this video, which featured former western Sydney resident Abdullah Elmir, who headed to Syria after reportedly telling his mother he was 'going fishing' Fled overseas: Bassima (centre) and Issam El Baf, the parents of (from L to R) Taha, Hamza, Bilal and Omar from Yagoona in western Sydney, have released an image of their four sons in an effort to locate them . The man was quoted saying video editing was 'kind of a hobby at first back in Australia... mostly cheap little film effects.' He stopped when he attended university, but it became a valuable skill working for the militant group in the Middle East. The young man is one of more than 70 Australians who have left for the Middle East to fight for the militant organisation. Many wannabe militants have failed to make it over there, with the Federal government cancelling more than 100 passports. One Australian militant who featured in the group's videos, so-called 'Ginger Jihadi' Abdullah Elmir, 17, declared in a propaganda broadcast in October that Islamic State would not rest until 'the black flag is flying high across every land'. The teenager vanished in June, reportedly telling his mother he was 'going fishing' - only to turn up in the propaganda video months later, surrounding by Islamic State fighters chanting loudly. Zakaria Raad, 22, also from Sydney, appeared in a recruitment video in June but died in an ambush in Syria shortly thereafter. Australian militant Zakaria Raad (left) appeared in an Islamic State propaganda video in June . Raad was killed shortly afterwards in an ambush in Syria . Professor Greg Barton, a terrorism expert from Monash University, told Daily Mail Australia it was 'quite chilling' to think many Australians living relatively ordinary lives had joined the terrorist group. 'It's all abstract, until the kid in the next suburb over is involved in doing that,' he said. Prof Barton said there has been no indication the number of citizens heading to Syria or Iraq has slowed recently. Four brothers from a western Sydney family vanished in November after telling family they were going on a trip to Thailand. They sent a text message to their sister saying: 'we will see you in Paradise.' Acclaimed German journalist Jürgen Todenhöfer, who recently spent 10 days embedded with the terror group in Mosul and Syria, said he was surprised by the hundreds of foreign fighters who have arrived from all over the world. In a detailed post on his Facebook site this wek, Todenhöfer wrote: 'The West underestimated the risk posed by IS dramatically. 'The IS fighters are much smarter and more dangerous than our leaders believe. 'In the Islamic State, there is an almost palpable enthusiasm and confidence of victory, which I have not seen in many war zones.' Prime Minister Tony Abbott this week warned security agencies have picked up 'heightened terrorist chatter' since last week's siege at the Lindt cafe in Martin Place.

"A number of turkeys are likely to be left feeling ‘unfulfilled’ tomorrow as stuffing topped the list of items most likely to be forgotten in the Christmas shop, new research revealed. Almost half of Brits (44 per cent) admit to forgetting at least one Christmas dinner essential in the mad Yuletide rush. Stuffing (11 per cent) was followed closely by cranberry sauce (10 per cent) as the most forgotten item. Scroll down for video . Almost half of Britons forget at least one Christmas dinner essential in the mad Yuletide rush . Stuffing (pictured), cranberry sauce, brandy sauce, bread sauce and sausages were the top five forgotten foods. While 3 per cent of shoppers have forgotten to purchase the all-essential turkey . Amazingly, three per cent of those surveyed said they were guilty of forgetting to buy the turkey when doing their Christmas food shopping, even though they passed by the poultry aisle. The survey of 4,000 Brits by Morrisons also revealed that 18-24 year olds are more than twice as likely to forget to buy a turkey for their Christmas dinner than stock up on alcohol supplies. Overall, five per cent will forget to buy alcohol as opposed to the three per cent who admitted forgetting to buy the most important item on the Christmas menu. It also revealed that we are a nation of over-shoppers with almost half of us (48 per cent) having to eat Christmas leftovers until the New Year due to overestimating the shopping. But a smug 47 per cent do buy just the right amount of food and drink. Brits will throw away the equivalent of 4.2 million dinners on Christmas Day, a study by Unilever revealed . On Christmas Day itself, a study by Unilever revealed British households will throw away the equivalent of 4.2 million dinners. The food we leave on our plates on December 25 adds up to to 263,000 turkeys, 740,000 Christmas puddings and 17.2 million Brussels sprouts across the UK. Figures showed that nearly 10 per cent of every festive meal is thrown away, which equates to an incredible £64million of wasted food. The sprouts alone would fill 1,000 wheelie bins, leftover carrots would reach from London to Munich when lined up end-to-end and unused gravy would fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool.","Almost half of Brits will forget at least one Christmas dinner essential .

"A court has heard mother-of-one Alison Morrison (pictured) who was allegedly murdered by her next-door neighbour, was stabbed 'at least' 35 times . A mother-of-one who was allegedly murdered by her next door neighbour was stabbed at least 35 times, a court heard yesterday. Charity executive Alison Morrison, 45, was allegedly ambushed as she walked to work by 48-year-old satellite TV engineer Trevor Gibbon, of Harrow, London. Mrs Morrison, a senior manager for consumer charity Which? and vice-Chair of the Harrow Safer Neighbourhood Board, was fatally stabbed in Alexandra Avenue, Harrow, northwest London on the morning of December 18. At the time residents reported hearing piercing screams and police were called to the attack. Mrs Morrison was taken to St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, west London, but died from her injuries. A post-mortem examination gave the cause of death as multiple stab wounds. Yesterday Gibbon appeared at the Old Bailey by video link from Wormwood Scrubs prison for a preliminary hearing. No bail application was made and he was remanded in custody by Judge Steven Kay QC until a plea and case management hearing on March 10 next year. Prosecutor Brian O'Neill, QC, said the attacker 'inflicted some 35 or so stab wounds to her torso as well as numerous other stab wounds of a defensive nature.' Gibbon was arrested in Lincolnshire later the same day and charged with murder. He did not enter a plea at yesterday's ten-minute hearing in court number ten. Mrs Morrison grew up in Bedhampton, Hampshire, and lived with her husband Cedric and 16 year-old son Kori in Harrow.

Tributes have been pouring in for Mrs Morrision, who has been described as a 'wonderful and caring' mother and wife who worked hard to reduce crime in her community. Her family said in a statement: 'Alison was an inspiration, a warm and loving person who will be deeply missed by her husband and son. 'Her devastating loss as a result of this senseless attack is also felt by all the family, local community and all who knew her.' Mrs Morrison grew up in Bedhampton, Hampshire, before moving to the capital after finishing university. She was planning to return home to see her family to celebrate Christmas this week. Flowers have been left at the spot on Alexandra Avenue where Mrs Morrison was stabbed to death in Harrow . One of the floral tributes is from Mrs Morrison's sisters - family members said they were very close . Her brother-in-law Lee Richards said her 46-year-old husband called the family to tell them the tragic news. He said: 'We are in shock. It couldn't have happened to a nicer lady. 'You know what sisters are like - you can't separate them. 'They received a phone call from Cedric to say there had been a situation. 'They left what they were doing and went straight up there.' Mrs Morrison's sister Paula received the news minutes after stepping off the plane at London Heathrow airport following a 10-day holiday in Cuba. Mr Richards said his wife Julie Brathwaite, a 52-year-old mother-of-two who runs a cleaning business, was inconsolable. He said: 'She's in a mess. I have left the sisters together - that's the best way. 'Alison was here a couple of weeks ago. My family were due to go up this weekend to the Olympia horse show.

He said she died a lot of voluntary work for her community, and was the vice-chairwoman of her local Neighbourhood Watch scheme. Her full-time job was as a senior manager at consumer organisation Which?, a position she moved to London for after studying a degree. He said: 'She was fun-loving and happy. She was sensible and responsible - this is a disaster.' Bianca Brathwaite, 24, Mrs Morrison's niece, added: 'She was everything you could ask for in a woman, she was strong and always stood up for herself and her family and is loved dearly.' David Perry, leader of Harrow Council, described her as a 'key member of the board'. He said: 'Alison Morrison was passionately committed to creating a safer Harrow through her work with the Harrow Safer Neighbourhood Board and as a community champion, and it is terrible news that she has lost her life in this violent way in a borough she cared so much about. 'Alison's colleagues on the Safer Neighbourhood Board are absolutely shattered by this news, as are the staff of Harrow Council. Alison was a key member of the board and a tireless advocate of its work. 'We will do whatever we can to help the police. In the meantime, our thoughts are with Alison's family.' Chief Superintendent Simon Ovens, borough commander for Harrow, said: 'I had the pleasure of knowing and working with Alison in her role as the vice-chair of our borough's Safer Neighbourhood Board.

"A chilli sauce company has been under attack on social media after labelling prime minister Tony Abbott an 'idiot' on their product. Darwin Chilli Co has triggered an online storm after a photograph of a 'Darwin Hot Sauce' bottle label was shared across Twitter and Facebook, which also drove the company's Facebook page to 72,000 percent in traffic. The label reads: 'Darwin hot sauce (sriracha style) is what it is. We are sorry that our Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, is an idiot. Heat level: Cat3.' The sauce company has come under attack for calling the Prime Minister an 'idiot' on its' chilli sauce bottles . The family-owned business started the labels shortly before Abbott was elected prime minister around September 2014. The company owner, who wished to not be named, told Daily Mail Australia the idea came to light from an 'old school labelling joke that started in France from the 1980s'. 'A french clothing company wrote under their washing instructions that they were sorry that their president was an idiot. It's funny and I've always remembered that. 'When I was making my labels, I remember hearing Tony Abbott's name everywhere so I made the first label as ""Don't vote for Tony Abbott, he's an idiot"", he said. 'But then he got elected so we had to apologise in the labels for our next batch of chilli sauces.' The Darwin based family-owned business has been making and selling chilli sauce during the past five years . The page has been backfired with negative comments after discovering the printed label on the bottle . He said the label is 'just a bit of a joke' and 'nearly everyone gets it' but it has offended a few over social media and has attracted a significant amount of 'internet trolls'. 'The negative comments don't bother us - it's just a sense of humour and we think it's hilarious. 'No one cares except the internet trolls who go on our page and give us one star ratings and abuse. 'But the negative stuff has actually kicked off our business and everybody is behind us. We couldn't be prouder. We started off defending ourselves but we've had so many nice people supporting us. 'We even had to shut down our official website because we ran out of stock.' The business owner said the label started during the election, before Abbott was appointed prime minister . The business has received a significant amount of supporters since the label was shared over social media . The family from Darwin has been making chilli sauces for the past five years. 'Our main focus is let our sauces do all the talking. It's 100 percent Australian made and every ingredient, down to the garlic is all from Australia. 'We just like chilli sauce and it's just what we do and sell at markets. The label was always written behind the bottles and it makes our customers read it and go ""hang on"". The business is currently closed for business but will reopen second week of January. 'We're looking at making a couple of ton next year and people are already placing their orders. We'll be sending out the first batch of sauces early next year so get in quick.' Despite the negative backlash on social media, the owner said the company will continue to run their 'Tony Abbott' labels. 'By popular demand, our Tony Abbott labelled sauce will be available for backorder,' he said. He added: 'To all the internet trolls, Merry Christmas and come say hi to us when you're in Darwin.'","Darwin Chilli Co has triggered an online storm over its' chilli label .

"A 114-year-old woman who challenged Facebook after the social media site wouldn't let her list her real age has died in Minnesota. Anna Stoehr, one of the nation's oldest residents, died Sunday in her sleep after several days in hospice care, according to her son, Harlan Stoehr. 'I don't think mother intended to live forever,' Harlan told KARE-11. 'She just got farther than most.' Scroll down for video . Birthday: Anna Stoehr (center), one of the nation's oldest residents' died in her sleep Sunday months after celebrating her 114th birthday . Facebook: Stoehr drew national attention earlier this year when she challenged Facebook's age policy; the social media site wouldn't allow her to list her actual birth year . Verified: Stoehr, born in 1900,  was hailed as the oldest Minnesota resident, and was the seventh oldest person verified to be living in the U.S. She drew national attention this year after  her attempt to create a Facebook account. Usually, most women would jump at the chance to claim a younger age, but not Stoehr. The social media site wouldn't let her enter a birth year before 1905, so she listed her age as 99. However, she wrote a letter -- fittingly, on an old type writer -- to the company saying, 'I'm still here.' In response, Facebook sent her a bouquet of 114 flowers for her most recent birthday, her son said. Now, however, the popular site founded by Mark Zuckerberg still does not allow users to choose a birth year earlier than 1905. 1905: The drop-down menu for users' birthdays on Facebook's current sign-up page still doesn't allow years earlier than 1905 . Profile: Stoehr's has 32 friends on her Facebook page and a photo she posted (shown above) has been shared more than 200 times on the social media site since it was posted in September . Founder: Stoehr wrote a letter to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg (photographed) Harlan told KARE that Anna's obituary will list two apple trees she planted at the age of 105 among her survivors. Stoehr's funeral will be held Saturday in Potsdam. Born in Iowa in 1900, Anna Stoehr's family moved to Wisconsin and South Dakota before settling in Ridgeway, Minnesota, in 1919. She lived in Minnesota the rest of her life, her son said. The Gerontology Research Group, which tracks many of the world's longest-living people, said Anna Stoehr was the oldest verified resident of Minnesota.. Stoehr was hailed as the oldest Minnesota resident, and was the seventh oldest person verified to be living in the U.S., according to Robert Young, a senior database administrator for the research group. The oldest woman in the U.S. is Gertrude Weaver, a 116-year-old woman from Arkansas. Stoehr's death comes just two days before that of Conrad Johnson, the 110 year-old man who was recognized as the oldest man in the U.S. Johnson's title is now held by Wash Wesley, a 111-year-old deacon from Illinois. Young said living to age '114 is extremely rare.' But he said the most amazing thing about Stoehr wasn't just her age, but the fact that she was willing to try new things, including Facebook and smartphones. Harlan  said his mother was sharp until the end. He joked that when he saw her a week ago, 'it was like she was 112 again.'","Anna Stoehr, one of the nation's oldest residents, died in her sleep Sunday at the age of 114 .

"Two men have cashed in on the popularity of ugly sweater parties - and the lack of garish sweaters on the market - by launching a multi-million dollar business. Evan Mendelsohn, 30, and Nick Morton, 32, of San Diego, California, created their cheeky apparel company, Tipsy Elves, in 2011; two years later, they appeared on ABC's Shark Tank, where they won $100,000 in funding for the brand. The pair, whose irreverent sweater designs include an image of Jesus in a party hat wearing a T-shirt that says 'birthday boy' and an illustration of Santa Claus urinating onto white snow, told Racked.com that their projected sales for 2014 are $8 million. Irreverent: Evan Mendelsohn and Nick Morton of San Diego, California, created Tipsy Elves, an apparel company that manufactures cheeky Christmas sweaters such as this one (seen on a model) Big Break: Mr Mendelsohn (left) and Mr Morton (right) earned publicity and a $100,000 investment when they appeared on Shark Tank in 2013 . The two friends, who met while fraternity brothers at the University of California, San Diego, began the venture as a side project while Mr Mendelsohn was practicing law and Mr Morton was working as a dentist. 'Nick and I had been to a lot of ugly Christmas sweater parties and had difficulty finding places to buy them,' Mr Mendelsohn recalled. They both tapped into their own savings, investing $140,000 in the business. While neither had experience selling apparel, they put in long hours to get the company off the ground. Inappropriate: Another popular Tipsy Elves sweater (seen on Mr Mendelsohn) features an illustration of Santa Claus urinating onto white snow . 'It was really difficult for us the first year because we were both working full-time jobs. I was coming home from work and staying up until 1 or 2 a.m. talking with suppliers in China. It was hectic, but once I saw that it went well, I was comfortable quitting my ""real"" job in our second year,' Mr Mendelsohn said. While social media coverage of their designs led to an appearance on the Today show, their big break came when a Shark Tank producer spotted one of their sweaters at a holiday party and contacted them. They went on the show and persuaded Robert Herjavec to invest $100,000 in return for 10per cent of the company. In June, Mr Herjavec told CNBC that Tipsy Elves had been his best investment in five seasons of Shark Tank. Cheeky: Two other popular designs include 'Reindeer Menage-a-Trois' (left) and 'Gingerbread Nightmare' (right) 'You have a highly educated lawyer making 200 grand a year, quits his job to sell inappropriate Christmas sweaters. How can you not love that?' he said of Mr Mendelsohn. In 2013, the company made about $3 million, having pulled in $800,000 the year before. Mr Mendelsohn said the biggest force driving their revenue has been their expansion into other product lines, such as college sweaters for large state schools including the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Michigan. They've also begun creating festive shirts for other popular holidays such as St. Patrick's Day and Valentine's Day. Watch your back: One silly design shows a 'suspicious gnome' wielding an axe . But their most popular designs are their risque holiday sweaters, which cost $34.95-$69.95, including one that shows a 'suspicious gnome' wielding an axe. Mr Mendelsohn thinks the popularity of ugly Christmas sweaters suggests a 'backlash against how serious the holidays have become'. 'Christmas sweaters were really popular in the '80s, and then they went out of style. When you look at the holidays, particularly starting around the early 2000s, they've become more of a serious, stressful time,' he said. 'There's an emphasis on black-tie events and formal holiday parties that no one wants go to. Ugly Christmas sweaters are a celebration of what holidays should be: having a good time and being silly.'","Evan Mendelsohn, 30, and Nick Morton, 32, of San Diego, California, created their cheeky apparel company, Tipsy Elves, in 2011 .

"American runner Nick Symmonds has become the first international athlete to speak out against Russia's ban on 'gay propaganda', but fears he'll 'get put in jail for it'. After winning a silver medal in the 800m in Moscow yesterday, the outspoken middle distance runner criticized the controversial law which passed in June. 'As much as I can speak out about it, I believe that all humans deserve equality however God made them,' Symmonds said after the race at Luzhniki stadium. 'Whether you're gay, straight, black, white, we all deserve the same rights. If there's anything I can do to champion the cause and further it I will, shy of getting arrested. I respect Russians' ability to govern their people. I disagree with their laws.' Scroll down for video . Brave: American runner Nick Symmonds has denounced Russia's law against 'gay propaganda' Symmonds' comments could contravene the new law which bans statements maintaining the 'equivalence of traditional and non-traditional sexual relations', according to The Guardian. The law has . prompted strong calls among Western activists for a boycott of the . Winter Olympics, which Russia will host in Sochi early next year. Foreign citizens who violate the law in the media face a fine of up to 100,000 roubles (US$3000), arrest for up to 15 days and deportation. Symmonds' statements come after he wrote a blog for Runner's World stating his support for gay rights. 'If I am . placed in a race with a Russian athlete, I will shake his hand, thank . him for his country's generous hospitality, and then, after kicking his . (butt) in the race, silently dedicate the win to my gay and lesbian . friends back home,' he wrote. 'Upon my return, I will then continue to fight for . their rights in my beloved democratic union.' However when questioned by AP about the laws in Moscow yesterday, he said:  'I can't talk about it. You're not allowed to talk about it here. I'll get put in jail . for it.' Scared: US runner Nick Symmonds, center in green, fears he could be imprisoned for standing up for gay rights in Russia . The intersection of politics and sports can be awkward, as this year's world championships demonstrates. The competition is being held at Luzhniki Stadium, the main venue used for the 1980 Moscow Olympics that the U.S. boycotted. Although the athletes at the worlds won't be competing in Sochi, it's the first major sports event hosted by Russia since the law was passed. It's also seen as an informal test event for the Olympics. Russia will also host the swimming world championships in 2015 and the World Cup in 2018, so how the law is enforced will likely be a long-standing issue for sports. Controversial: Russian President Vladimir Putin signed into law the bill punishing people for homosexual 'propaganda' Symmonds' concern about jail underlines how the law's vagueness makes it intimidating. The law's definition of 'propaganda' hinges on intent. Anyone who distributes information with the 'intention' of persuading minors that non-traditional sexual relationships are 'attractive' or 'interesting' could be accused of breaking the law. Russia has given contradictory signals on how the law will apply to the Olympics. Some said the law would be suspended during the games, but the Interior Ministry has said it would be enforced. International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge said last week that the Russian government provided written reassurances about the law, but that more clarity was needed. FIFA has also asked for 'clarification and more details'. During the Olympics, the IOC bans athletes from making political statements.","US runner Nick Symmonds fears he will be imprisoned for denouncing Russia's ban on 'gay propaganda'

"Fatbergs the size of buses could clog sewers across the UK this Christmas as tonnes of turkey and goose fat is poured down kitchen sinks. Calls to clogged drains and sewers are predicted to rise by a third over the festive period as thousands of homes attempt to flush fat and leftovers down their sinks. Fatbergs – dubbed 'Turkeybergs' over the Christmas period – can measure the size of a double-decker bus or Boeing 747, and solidify in the sewers leading to foul-smelling waste and blockages. Scroll down for video . Calls to blocked drains and sewers are predicted to rise by a third over the Christmas period and the number of fatbergs expected to increase thanks to festive cooking and people pouring  turkey and goose fat down their kitchen sinks. Pictured: A fatberg in Kingston, south London . Fatbergs – dubbed 'Turkeybergs' over the Christmas period – can measure the size of a double-decker bus or Boeing 747, and solidify in the sewers leading to foul-smelling waste and blockages. Pictured: This fatberg in south London last year contained weighed 15,000 tonnes . The congealed lumps of fat are made up of waste products which cannot be broken down, including everything from solidified fat and food waste to wet wipes, sanitary products and plastic bottles. The unsightly obstructions in the sewers cost waste companies millions of pounds every Christmas, because they have to pay workers overtime to unblock the system at short notice. Thames Water spends approximately £1million a month clearing fatbergs and blockages, dealing with more than 55,000 of them every  year. Dave Dennis, the sewer manager for west London, said: 'We find objects every day that should not be there. Planks of wood, plastic bottles, and the bane of our lives - wet wipes. 'They may say flushable on the packet but they don't break down inside the sewer. They cling to cooled cooking fat and form fatbergs, which block pipes and flood our customers with sewage.' Thames Water spends approximately £1million a month clearing fatbergs and blockages, dealing with more than 55,000 of them every year . The congealed lumps of fat are made up of waste products which cannot be broken down, including solidified fat, food waste and wet wipes . He is now pleading with people across the UK to stop using  drains and kitchen sinks to pour away cooking fat. 'Please remember next time you go to throw cooking oil down the drain or wet wipes down the loo - bin it, don't block it,' he said. A 'fatberg' is a congealed lump consisting of fat, wet wipes, sanitary products and other items in sewer systems, which cannot be broken down. They clog the underground sewer system, causing all kinds of sanitation and drainage problems, as well as blockages further up the line. 'Fatberg' is the official term given to the deposits by Thames Water in London. Earlier this year, a fatberg the size of a Boeing 747 was discovered beneath the streets of Shepherd's Bush in west London. The blockage was made up of waste fat, wet wipes, food, tennis balls and planks of wood. Another in Kingston, south London, was recorded as weighing 15 tonnes and was found to be a congealed lump of festering food mixed with wet wipes. And last month, a fatberg stretching 66 feet beneath the government offices in Whitehall was discovered. The 'berg' - one of the biggest ever to be cleared by Thames Water - was created by people throwing wet wipes and fat down drains and toilets, which then congealed into a large immovable mass. It was stuck in the sewer at the junction of Whitehall Court and Whitehall Place in south London. Officials examining the fatberg found nail varnish pots, a pencil sharpener, condoms, and sanitary products - all of which should not have been there. Mr Dennis added: 'We have 67,108 miles of sewers, and that's a lot of pipe to keep clear. 'We spend £12million a year tackling blockages, most of them formed because people have tipped cooking fats down the drain and wet wipes down the loo. 'The sewers serve an important purpose - they are not an abyss for household rubbish.'","Calls to blocked drains and sewers predicted to rise by a third over Christmas period thanks to festive cooking .

"From a 'health and safety' tree decorated with hazard tape and a traffic cone fairy to  one made entirely of rubbish bags, are these Britain's worst Christmas trees? The dodgy Christmas trees, from towns and villages up and down the country, have been ridiculed as being the worst in the country for their poor decoration and non-traditional, and occasionally  bizarre design. One town's tree was so bad that it even had it's own Facebook page - The Embarrassment of Mottram Christmas Tree! - set up by locals in the Greater Manchester village in protest over its  spindly, sparse branches and lack of decorations. Scroll down for videos . In Mier, Stoke-on-Trent, their town Christmas tree was literally rubbish: Plastic bags collected by local schoolchildren were stacked high to create the bizarre festive offering (pictured) In Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire, the choice of decorations was described 'as something you'd find after an explosion in a rag factory' (left) while in Streatham, London, locals were left with a conical piece of white plastic with lights topped with a star and decorated with one solitary piece of tinsel and a few baubles (right) Based on a lonely patch of grass at a crossroads, the tree nicknamed 'twiggy' was decorated with a solitary string of fairy lights until residents decided to decorate it themselves. But at least theirs was actually a tree. In Mier, Stoke-on-Trent, their town Christmas tree was literally rubbish. Plastic bags collected by local schoolchildren were stacked high to create the bizarre festive offering. In some areas, the trees were considered such a health and safety risk they were fenced off from the public. This health-and-safety-conscious tree in north Oxford was decorated with bows made from hazard warning tape and plastic and instead of an angel on top, sits a plastic traffic cone (pictured) This unusual Christmas tree in Dymchurch, Kent, was described as a 'great big weed growing out of a stick' Locals in Mottram, Greater Manchester, set up a Facebook page in protest against their town tree - The Embarrassment of Mottram Christmas Tree! - until they decide to decorate it themselves (right) while this conical tree (left) was dubbed one of the worst in the country when it appeared in Stockton-on-Tees High Street last year and has now been donated to a local charity . Christmas trees in Derby, in the Midlands, Stockton-on-Tees in Middlesborough  and Liscard in Merseyside were all surrounded by metal fences, leading to Liscard residents branding their town's festive feature an 'absolute joke' and launching a campaign to jazz up their 'depressing' tree. But when it came to red tape, it was hard to beat the health-and-safety-conscious tree in north Oxford. Surrounded by plastic fencing, it was decorated with bows made from hazard warning tape and plastic. Instead of an angel on top, sits a plastic traffic cone. Other criticism came over trees being too bare and under decorated, non-traditional shapes and design and - in the case of one in Dymchurch, Kent, the fact it allegedly looked like 'a great big weed growing out of a stick'. In Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire, the choice of decorations was described 'as something you'd find after an explosion in a rag factory' while in Streatham, London, locals were left with a conical piece of white plastic with lights topped with a star and decorated with one solitary piece of tinsel and a few baubles. And a conical tree, dubbed one of the worst in the country when it was placed on Stockton-on-Tees High Street last year, was so hated it has not returned but has been donated to a local charity. People complained  trees had been fenced off from the public by a health and safety perimeter such as this conical festive offering in Derby .

"This brave young family will be doing their best to celebrate this Christmas after receiving the devastating news their mother is terminally ill with cancer. Kerry Briggs was first diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer three years ago when she discovered a lump as she breastfed her seven-month-old daughter. The 35-year-old, who lives at Sheidow Park in Adelaide, had a double mastectomy and underwent 12 months of gruelling chemotherapy, radiotherapy and intravenous therapy to successfully rid her body of cancer. Scroll down for video . Kerry Briggs, pictured here with her two children Lachlan, 7, and Caitlin, 3, was told she incurable cancer just weeks before Christmas . But two years on from her last chemotherapy treatment, Mrs Briggs was informed the cancer she thought was gone had now spread to her pelvis, spine, ribs and liver. Mrs Briggs, her husband David and children Lachlan, 7, and Caitlin, 3, were told the heartbreaking news on November 26 that she was losing her battle. 'It still hasn't sunk in, none of us are coping. We've only got a limited amount of time and we don't know how long,' Mr Briggs told Daily Mail Australia. 'My son's a mess because he remembers the chemo from last time. They both know the cancer has come back, but they don't know the full problem of where it's heading.' Mrs Briggs was first diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer three years ago when she discovered a lump as she breastfed her seven-month-old daughter . The 35-year-old, pictured here having her last chemotherapy treatment two years ago, had a double mastectomy and underwent 12 months of gruelling treatment to successfully rid her body of cancer . Doctors have given Mrs Briggs a 50 percent chance of surviving the next four to five years, which means  she might not get the chance to see her children finish primary school. But Mrs Briggs' family refuse to give up hope and they are taking every measure to ensure she stays as healthy as possible. Her husband says it will all depend on Mrs Briggs' liver function and how she responds to chemotherapy and the various other drugs she will be taking for the rest of her life. 'The aim for us now is to make some lasting memories that the kids will remember,' he said. 'Family holidays (like Christmas and birthdays) will be very precious over the next few years... but they can also be the most difficult times.'

'My wife wants to have a white Christmas next year (in America) - that's on her bucket list. We're also hoping to get away on some other family holidays next year. 'There's also potential future chemotherapy treatments that aren't covered by the PBS that we're looking at... this all adds up.'

"This is the terrifying moment when scores of hammerhead sharks swim peacefully past a group of scuba divers  just metres away. The underwater footage shows around an estimate of 100 sharks swimming casually though the deep blue sea at South West Rocks on the mid-north coast of NSW. Diving instructor, Steve Skinner who caught it on camera, told Daily Mail Australia that his closer encounter with the school of hammerheads couldn't deter him from his passion of diving. Scroll down for video . The terrifying moment when scores of sharks swim peacefully past a group of scuba divers just metres away . 'It was completely unexpected to see that many hammerheads around here but it was awesome and a pretty exciting day,' Skinner said. 'We rarely get hammerheads in the area and it was a very off chance that they'd come around but I'm pretty happy about that. 'I was more concerned for a woman I was instructing during my course because she was a little scared but she thought it was pretty exciting too.' Skinner, who has been diving for 18 years, said he hasn't had any 'scary moments' in his career. 'I'm usually not scared because I've been underwater for so long but a close encounter I had was with great white sharks,' he said. The video was posted on Facebook by South West Rocks Dive Centre and has received more than 33,000 views and almost 600 shares.

"A smirking thug who ran up and kicked his victim's head 'like taking a penalty kick' at a music festival has been jailed. Leon Wong, 32, was caught on mobile phone footage running at victim Jordan Holmes and kicking him  in the face at the Parklife Weekender in Heaton Park, Manchester, in June. He had already punched Mr Holmes in the face prior to the kick, and went on to attack his friend Andrew Bartholomew when he tried to intervene. Smirking thug Leon Wong, 32, (left) has been jailed after he ran up and kicked Jordan Holmes's head 'like taking a penalty' at a music festival. Mr Holmes (right) lost four of his teeth in the attack in June . Wong, from Widnes, who appeared to be smirking in his police mugshot, admitted causing actual and grievous bodily harm at an earlier hearing at Manchester Crown Court and has now been jailed for 18 months. He had fled the scene after the attack - jumping into a stranger's car before asking them to get him away from the scene. However, he was found after the couple saw appeals for information about an unrelated suspected murder at the festival on the same day and contacted police. Wong's blood was found in the vehicle and though he was not connected to the death of festival-goer Robert Hart - who died after he was punched at the event, he was linked to assaults on Mr Holmes and Mr Bartholomew. Wong was caught on mobile phone footage running at victim Mr Holmes and kicking him in the face at the Parklife Weekender in Heaton Park, Manchester, in June . Crown Square court was told Wong had been talking to a woman in the Kaluki tent at Parklife, on Friday June 7, when he was attacked by two men. He then mistakenly believed Mr Holmes and Mr Bartholomew were responsible - and launched his own savage attack. Mr Holmes lost four of his teeth, and both men suffered facial injuries in the attack, which one witness described as if Wong was running up to take a penalty kick. Charles Langley, mitigating, said his client had been 'disgusted and shocked' when shown footage of his actions, which happened in a 'moment of madness'. But Judge Robert Atherton told Wong: 'If ever there was a case of violence begetting violence this is it. 'A punch would have been one thing but I think the description given that it looks like someone running up to take a penalty kick at a football is much more accurate. 'That's what struck me and someone present and the ball is the head, that could've caused very serious injuries. This could easily have been a case in which someone's life was lost.' Wong, who has ten previous convictions for offences including common assault, possession of heroin and perverting the course of justice, pleaded guilty to one charge of actual bodily harm and one of grievous bodily harm at an earlier hearing. He was jailed for 18 months for the attack on Mr Holmes and four months for the attack on Mr Bartholomew, to run concurrently.","Leon Wong, 32, caught on mobile phone kicking Jordan Holmes in the face .

"Labor Opposition leader John Robertson has been forced to step down from his role after it was revealed he wrote a letter on behalf of Sydney siege gunman Man Haron Monis. In the letter to the NSW Department of Community Services in August, 2011, Mr Robertson asked for Monis to be granted at least one hour's supervised access to his sons on Father's Day. The decision to resign comes just three months out from the NSW state election, which is expected to be won by the Michael Baird-led coalition government. Mr Robertson, 52, has been under fire for his response to the revelation he wrote the letter, after he intially refused to release publically release his correspondence with Monis, then said his office 'didn't have time to Google' the past crimes of Monis before signing the letter. Scroll down for video . 'It has become clear to me that I've lost the support of some of my Labor colleagues,' Mr Robertson said. 'So as a lifelong Labor man, I have decided to step aside as Labor leader.' Mr Robertson, the member for Blacktown, had been leader since March 2011, when the party lost government after one of the worst election routs in the state's history. In the letter, Mr Robertson asked for Monis to be granted access to his sons despite his estranged wife Noleen Hayson Pal, having an Apprehended Violence Order issued against him. Mr Robertson also wrote his letter in support of Monis depsite the fact he had been prosecuted for sending offensive letters to the families of death Australian soldiers. ""[Monis] has asked me to appeal to you, to grant him a supervised access visit of at least one hour in your Liverpool office for Father's Day,"" Mr Robertson wrote to Community Services in August, 2011. ""He is requesting visits ... on a regular basis of at least one to two times per week until the Family Law Court matter has been resolved."" At the time, Monis was a resident of Mr Robertson's Blacktown constituency in Sydney's western suburbs . Mr Robertson has resigned just three months for the NSW state election . Referring to the letter he sent on behalf of Monis, Mr Robertson said he accepted how it might appear given last week's siege, which ended in the deaths of hostages Katrina Dawson and Tori Johnson. 'The tragic event at Martin Placed touched the lives of people across our city, our state and our nation,' he said. 'My heart goes out to the victims and their families, specially today. 'I offer my sincere condolences and they should know that we all are grieving with them.' Mr Robertson said he was disappointed that after four years he was not going to lead Labor to the 2015 poll. But he was proud of his role in clamping down on corruption within the NSW party branch. 'I have rid the party of those who betrayed the great Labor cause,' he said. 'We have dragged the party out of the pit of electoral oblivion.' Mr Robertson then wrote to Monis after his request was denied, referring to the organisation Lone Father Association of Australia for further support. The correspondence was released on Monday afternoon. Despite signing the letter, Mr Robertson continues to deny he endorsed Monis. He said it was a straightforward matter similar to the thousands of constituent requests handled by politicians every year. Mr Robertson urged NSW Department of Community Services to grant siege killer Monis (above) access to his sons . ""This was a letter that forwarded a request to an agency,"" he said. ""It in no way supported or endorsed anything that this man was asking for."" Mr Robertson played down the significance of his signature, saying he signs every letter out of his office as a matter of protocol. All correspondence has been forwarded to the joint investigation into the Martin Place siege. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said on Monday that the nation must learn from its 'brush with terrorism'. Sydney siege gunman Man Haron Monis (above) had written to John Robertson asking him to write on his behalf to the NSW Department of Community Services to gain access to his sons . ""If this review shows that there are further policy changes needed, they will be done,"" he told the Nine Network's Today show. His comments came after it emerged that the national security hotline was tipped off about Monis's extremism only days before the Martin Place siege. Mr Abbott said officials looked at Monis's website but took no further action because there were no imminent threats of violence.","NSW Labor Opposition leader quit after outcry about the letter he wrote .

"For their wedding last week, terminally ill bride Liza Heaton and her newlywed husband, Wyatt, were given the the best gift of all -- a kernel of hope. Heaton, 25, from Louisiana, had been in remission from synovila sarcoma for three years, but last Thursday she received the devastating news that she has just one month to live. Her rare form of cancer had returned with a vengeance and cannot be treated using traditional methods. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

Wyatt and Liza Heaton share a laugh as they cut the cake at the wedding reception . Facing the devastating prospect of losing his girlfriend in the very near future, Wyatt Heaton threw a surprise wedding for the cancer-stricken woman. But the best part came after the bittersweet event. The following day, the Heatons learned that the obstruction that was preventing Liza's treatment cleared, allowing the newlywed to take a chemotherapy pill. If all goes according to plan, the treatment will stop the growth of Heaton's tumors, and possibly even shrink them. Michelle Haynie, Heaton's mother, told 11Alive the hope is her daughter will be able to join a drug trial in the spring to treat the cancer. Since receiving the good news, Heaton has left hospice care and her treatment is no longer considered palliative. ‘Last week we were thinking hospice. Only a few weeks left. Then with this chemo pill we weren't given a time frame. We're hopeful to beat it again and go into remission and spend the rest of our lives together,’ Liza told the station. The family have been inspired to launch a GoFundMe campaign to raise money towards cancer research. Since the page went live a week ago, more than 2,800 people have donated a whopping $352,000, and counting. Heaton said she was overwhelmed by the response from her family, friends, and even celebrities. 'Someone got Lance Armstrong to call me last night,' Heaton gushed.

Last week, it seemed to Liza that her dreams of marrying her boyfriend Wyatt would never materialize. Wyatt had other ideas. Calling on more than 100 relatives and friends from across the United States to flock to Shreveport, Louisiana, he planned a wedding in just two days. On Saturday December 13 (12.13.14), they exchanged vows by the riverside at dusk and promised each other they would continue fighting the disease to the end. 'When they said it would not be months, but weeks, I took that to mean a wedding was off the table,' Liza told Shreveport Times. 'Wyatt took it to mean, OK, we have to get married this weekend.' Wyatt and Liza Heaton share a kiss at the wedding reception. Liza is now planning to join a clinical trial in a desperate bid to find treatment .

Her sister has also set up a Love for Liza page on GoFundMe to raise funds for other medication they plan to pursue. She had been investigating options since doctors first rediscovered the cancer on Thanksgiving Day, when she went to hospital with stomach pains. It was the first sign of any medical problems since Liza was given the all-clear in 2011.

'When it came back this time, it was such a whirlwind. You're not really ever ready for that news.' Her first instinct was to tell every friend and relative. 'I guess I would want everyone to know that people who have cancer... you're still living.

"David Warner will play the Boxing Day Test and Shane Watson should too, but far more grievous matters remain at the forefront of their minds. Warner on Wednesday batted for the first time since hurting his thumb in the second Test win over India at the Gabba last week. Watson also took part in the Christmas Eve session at the MCG, a day after being dazed by a bouncer that struck his helmet. Shane Watson is seen in the field on day four of the second Test match between Australia and India at the Gabba . Watson  puts his hand on his head after being hit in the helmet by a bouncer, a confronting moment for the entire squad . The hit was a confronting moment for the entire squad, especially the likes of Watson and Warner who were in the field when Phillip Hughes was fatally injured by a bouncer. 'It probably shook him (Watson) up a lot more than he would have anticipated,' Warner said. 'He was close to Hughesy. It brought back a bit of a memory for him and he got back on the horse and trained again today which was fantastic.' Warner suggested Hughes' death is never far from his thoughts. 'It's going to be in the back of my mind every time I play,' he said. 'Every time I sit at home and I'm thinking about nothing but that. We've got to keep pushing on. He'd want us to do that.' Batsman David Warner leaves the field after being dismissed for six runs . Warner said ex team mate Phil Hughes' death is never far from his thoughts: 'It's going to be in the back of my mind every time I play,' he said . Warner did just that at the MCG, starting with some throwdowns from batting coach Michael Di Venuto. The aggressive opener was somewhat apprehensive early, immediately pulling his left hand off the bat after the first few strokes. But Warner soon found his rhythm, driving and hooking with few signs of discomfort and then facing Nathan Lyon and some net bowlers. The 28-year-old declared he will be ready for the third Test, and that middling the ball would be the best form of pain management. Phil Hughes, who died in tragic circumstances last month after being struck in the head by a bouncer . 'I tried to have a dip at the spinners to see if I could actually hit the ball as hard as I can and it did feel real sore,' Warner said. 'I had to try and grind it out and get through that pain and I was able to do that. 'When the ball hits the splice I found out today it's going to be quite painful, but I can bear that pain.' Warner will wear a finger splint and expects to be shifted to mid-off while fielding. Watson started the session with a bowling machine in the indoor nets, then faced some medium-pacers in the outdoor nets. Warner declared he will be ready for the third Test, and that middling the ball would be the best form of pain management . 'He practiced as well as I've seen him hit the ball,' Warner said. 'He looked great.' As did Ryan Harris, who proved his fitness bowling in tandem with Mitchell Johnson and Josh Hazlewood. Shaun Marsh was struck on his left hand by a rising delivery from Josh Hazlewood on Wednesday. Marsh headed to the rooms for further assessment, but returned to the nets for some throwdowns. 'You go 12 months without someone getting hit in the nets and then all of a sudden you have three or four in the one net session, and that's cricket,' Warner said.","Batsman David Warner said Hughes' death is never far from his thoughts .

"Police are investigating a second offensive message posted on social media about the tragic Glasgow bin lorry crash which killed six people. North Yorkshire Police confirmed today that the force was 'aware of an offensive comment on social media' regarding the tragedy. It follows the arrest of a 19-year-old man from Sunderland, who allegedly posted a crass message on Twitter following the incident on Monday. Scroll down for video . North Yorkshire Police confirmed today that the force was 'aware of an offensive comment on social media' regarding the bin lorry crash in Glasgow city centre which killed six people. Pictured: Flowers at the scene . Witnesses believe the lorry driver became ill behind the wheel and lost control of the vehicle. The lorry careered along the pavement in Glasgow centre on Monday before colliding with a hotel in George Square . Police said they were contacted by Facebook users over the latest offensive message, which was apparently made by a woman in York. The force tweeted today: 'We are aware of an offensive comment on social media regarding the £georgesquare tragedy. 'We are assisting @policescotland with enquiries.' The Sunderland teenager, who was arrested on suspicion of making a malicious communication on Monday, has since been released on bail, Northumbria Police said. Officers are still carrying out investigations into the circumstances surrounding the crash, and are keen to determine what caused the bin lorry to career 300 metres along a crowded pavement. Six people died and 10 were injured after the lorry apparently veered out of control in the city's George Square before crashing into the side of the Millennium Hotel. The accident happened at about 2.30pm on Monday afternoon in the city's busiest square, which was packed with Christmas shoppers and families enjoying the annual winter carnival.

Jack Sweeney (left) had been shopping at the time of the crash, which also killed Jacqueline Morton (right) Gillian Ewing, from Edinburgh (left), and primary school teacher Stephenie Tait (right) were also killed . One witness described the lorry as knocking people down 'like pinballs' in the crash. It is thought the driver may have fallen ill at the wheel as he travelled up Queen Street and his vehicle struck a pedestrian outside the Gallery of Modern Art. Those who died have been named as student Erin McQuade and her grandparents Jack and Lorraine Sweeney, all from Dumbarton. Primary teacher Stephenie Tait, Gillian Ewing and Jacqueline Morton were also killed when the council truck mounted the pavement. Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS Board confirmed today that five patients, including a 14-year-old girl, were still being treated in hospital for injuries.

"Danah Stephens, the mother of  16 week old Paris Vince-Stephens who was shaken to death by her father, has been found dead at her Bristol home . A mother whose boyfriend was jailed for shaking their baby to death after he lost his temper when his cannabis ran out has been found dead. Paris Vince-Stephens was just 16 weeks old when she suffered 'catastrophic' head injuries and died after being shaken by her father William Stephens at her home in Bristol. The 25-year-old shook the baby so hard she was bleeding from her eyes and he was jailed last year for manslaughter. Almost a year later the child's mother, Danah Vince, 20, was found dead at her home in Southmead in Bristol. Miss Vince was also accused of killing her daughter but was acquitted during the seven week trial last year. Her body was found on November 29 and a post mortem into her death has so far been inconclusive. On the day of Paris's death, Stephens and Miss Vince had become 'agitated' because they had run out of drugs. The pair argued and Miss Vince  left her daughter in the care of her father while she went out to the doctors. While she was out Stephens is said to have shaken the youngster after losing his temper with the child when she was crying in January last year. The shaking caused a fatal brain bleed and Paris was taken to Bristol Children's Hospital where she was put on life support for three days until she died. During the trial a shocked expert said he had never before seen such a severe case of bleeding in the eyes. Sentencing him to six years in prison for manslaughter, Mr Justice Teare told Stephens: ' 'This is a case where a loss of control has resulted in a fatal act of violence on a defenceless baby. 'You will have to live with the fact that you killed your daughter.' He added that Stephens' learning disabilities could have been a factor in the child's death. During the trial, at Bristol Crown Court, the jury heard the young parents had a 'volatile' relationship and there was evidence of arguments and fighting. Social services stepped in and the couple had both signed agreements not to resort to domestic violence. Paris Vince-Stephens was just 16 weeks old when she was shaken so violenty by her father she died . But, even though Stephens, who had learning difficulties and an IQ in the low 50s, was subject to a restraining order banning him from contacting Ms Vince, the court was told there was evidence he was still living with her on the day Paris was taken to Bristol Children's Hospital. An examination on Paris's body found she had either been shaken or suffered a head injury from hitting her head against a soft surface - or a combination of both. During his trial Stephens, who has an IQ of 52 and cannot read, initially told police he had not touched his daughter all day - claiming she had simply gone 'all floppy' while he was feeding her. But he later admitted he 'slightly shook her' at Miss Vince's flat in Bristol. The court heard Stephens had previous convictions and warnings for violence relating to Miss Vince and his own mother, and previously punched a pregnant woman 'a number of times'. He had also used crack cocaine and heroin. He had been handed community orders, cautions, reprimands and warnings for the offences. Ignatious Hughes, defending, said Stephens's 'modest' upbringing in a 'drug-ridden' neighbourhood meant it was 'hardly surprising' he had acquired previous convictions and a drug habit. William Stephens was jailed for six years for manslaughter after he caused the death of his daughter . Mr Hughes also explained that Stephens had been attacked several times while in custody - including scalding water being thrown at his face - due to the nature of his offence. Speaking after the case, James Ward, crown advocate for the Crown Prosecution Service South West, described the case as 'difficult' and said people needed to understand Stephen's sentence was given because he did not intend to kill the child. 'He didn’t intend to kill the baby, nor did he intend to cause it really serious harm. 'Also, the defendant does have serious learning difficulties. His IQ is between 52 and 54. He lost control when he had that baby, probably because it cried. 'As a result of that, he shook it and that baby died.' A spokesman for Avon and Somerset Constabulary said they were called to Miss Vince's house on the afternoon of November 29 after her body had been found. He said: 'A post mortem into the death has been held but this was inconclusive. 'The matter was referred to the coroner as a sudden death. We are continuing to make inquiries on behalf of the coroner.","Paris Vince-Stephens was shaken to death by her father William Stephens .

"Brightly-coloured primary school classrooms are being toned down with shades of beige to calm rowdy pupils - but fed-up teachers say the bland tones make them feel like they are working in Ikea. Some schools, including Berkhamsted pre-prep school in Hertfordshire, are choosing to replace garish primary colours with neutral tones to calm children down while improving their behaviour and attainment levels. Several schools and councils have employed Elizabeth Jarman, an education expert who specialises in creating effective learning environment to help improve their classrooms. Traditional, brightly-coloured primary school classrooms are being replaced with a muted palette of beige in a bid to calm rowdy pupils, particularly in younger classes - but some teachers do not like the changes . Berkhamsted head teacher Samantha Jaspal told The Times: 'Not all staff like the look of a beige, natural classroom and are comparing it with a Swedish store showroom.' She went on to explain that they made the changes to a blander environment after noticing children appeared to prefer being taught outside in a natural environment. They replaced brightly coloured display boards to hessian and swapped colourful tables for natural wood - and Ms Jaspal says the changes have had a clear impact on pupils' focus and behaviour in the classroom. Some teachers do not approve of the blander classrooms and say it makes them feel like they work at Ikea . 'Children who are easily distracted are able to concentrate for longer periods if the spaces around them are uncluttered.' she said. 'We have noticed this particularly when teaching early reading.' Ms Jarman, who has a background in teaching, told MailOnline: ‘We know so much more about children’s brains now and they are critical ingredients when we are thinking about environments. ‘We need to challenge some of the historical stereotypes about the way that environments have traditionally been set up for children, based on what we know today about brain development, language acquisition, child development and attachment theory.’ When asked about the Ikea comment, Ms Jarman said: ‘I would agree. A lot of the thinking we challenge, people hold onto because that’s how they’ve always done it and that’s what you expect to see. ‘When you look in toy shops and the environments children are spending time in, they just give them sensory overload. ‘We need to get the balance right, that is so important. ‘In a world of information overload we need to be thinking about where are the places you can be still, reflect and consolidate your thinking? We need to create more of that.’ In 2006 research claimed brightly decorated classrooms covered with colourful displays can damage children's education and some primary schools were told to tone down their environments. The report from the Basic Skills Agency warned that classrooms which were too 'cluttered' with colour could disrupt young children's concentration. The report said: 'Over-stimulating environments are not always the best. 'That has implications for the use of displays. Sometimes it is a visual overload for children. 'It can make it very difficult for them to concentrate.' Schools are replacing bright colours  and de-cluttering classrooms to make them calmer places to learn . The study focused on how the school environment can affect children's speaking and listening skills. The report added: 'Spaces should take account of environmental factors that can impact on learning, for example, light, colour, noise. 'The environment should not be over-stimulating. 'Cosy, small areas, where children feel safe and able to chat in privacy are necessary.'","Schools are choosing neutral colours in classrooms to calm rowdy pupils .

"A gunman armed with two fully loaded shotguns and a knife has been arrested by French police after he was spotted 'armed to the teeth' and walking towards Cannes city centre. His arrest comes just hours after the French government ordered an extra 300 soldiers to patrol city streets in an attempt to quell a spate of 'lone wolf' attacks that have rocked the country this week. The wave of violence began on Saturday with the stabbing of three police officers and was followed by two incidents in which vehicles were driven into groups of pedestrians, injuring dozens. Armed soldiers patrol the streets of Paris in the wake of a series of 'lone wolf' attacks . The French government requested an additional 300 troops to conduct foot patrols after three police officers were stabbed on Saturday and dozens of pedestrians injured when vehicles were driven into them on Sunday and Monday . The gunman was arrested after police spotted him on CCTV making his way towards the centre of Cannes (pictured) armed with two shotguns and a 25cm knife . The latest arrest comes after police spotted the gunman on CCTV 'armed to the teeth' and walking into Cannes city centre in south east France. While his intentions were not immediately clear, he was arrested near Forville market armed with two loaded shotguns and a 25cm knife, Sky News reported. On Monday, after three days of seemingly random acts of violence, France's government implored people to remain calm. It began on Saturday when a man was shot dead by police after stabbing three police officers. Bertrand Nzohabonayo was killed after entering a police station in the central town with a knife and seriously wounding two officers, including slashing one in the face. Nzohabonayo, who had posted an IS flag on his Facebook account, was a French national born in Burundi in 1994. He was also heard shouting 'Allahu Akbar' during the assault and local prosecutor Jean-Luc Beck said investigators would seek to determine whether 'he acted alone or if he acted on orders'. The brother of Nzohabonayo, who attacked police Saturday, was arrested the same day in their homeland, Burundi. The country's intelligence spokesman said both men had links with radical Islam. In an interview Tuesday with French radio, their sister denied it. Two police officers stand guard at the Christmas market in Nantes, where a man on Monday drove a car into a group of pedestrians . The Dijon man, who cried out 'God is great' in Arabic, had been hospitalized 157 times since 2001, the prosecutor said. She described him as having an 'incoherent' motive involving the treatment of Chechen children. Over the next two days, two men drove vehicles into pedestrians in almost identical attacks. Officials said they were unrelated, and that the two drivers in particular had no direct links to terrorism or radical Islam. The prime minister lamented 'the ravages of propaganda on fragile minds' before increasing military patrols. A visibly distressed woman is accompanied across the road by a police officer after a man drove a vehicle into a group of pedestrians in Dijon on Sunday . Roads surrounding the square in the centre of Dijon remained closed for hours as police investigated . 'People were running everywhere,' said Mohammed Bader Ghegate, who was among the witnesses in the Monday night attack at the Christmas market in Nantes. A 25-year-old man died yesterday of injuries sustained in the attack, local prosecutor Brigitte Lamy said at a news conference. The driver remains hospitalized and police have not been able to question him, Lamy said. Just a day before, on the other side of France, another driver had done almost exactly the same thing, bumping over sidewalks and into small groups of people throughout the city of Dijon. Thirteen people were injured. The police station in Joue-les-Tours, central France, where police on Saturday shot dead a man who attacked them with a knife while shouting 'Allahu Akbar' Both suspects, who survived, have long histories of mental illness. The first attack to set France on edge in recent days, the stabbing of three police officers on Saturday, is so far the only one drawing the attention of counterterrorism investigators. 'These three events have no links, but there is a concurrence that requires vigilance,' President Francois Hollande said. Prime Minister Manuel Valls urged France to avoid overreacting to isolated incidents in a country on alert after repeated threats from Muslim extremists, including one broadcast in a propaganda video on Friday by a masked and bearded Frenchman surrounded by gun-toting Islamic State fighters. 'We want to protect and reassure the French people,' Valls said, announcing that as many as 300 soldiers would be added to patrols already in place.","A man has been arrested 'armed to the teeth' with shotguns and knife .

"For most dogs, Christmas is the time to bundle around in festive wrapping paper, or sneak the last scraps of the  turkey dinner from under the dining room table. But for these adorable canines and cats, Christmas is yet another day spent waiting to be chosen by a loving family to be welcomed into a new home. More than 180 animals will spend today at the Battersea Dogs and Cats Home's flagship centre in south west London, where they will be looked after by a team of volunteers. Scroll down for video . Jack Russell Monty is one of around 100 dogs who will spend Christmas at Battersea Dogs and Cats Home . Pippa, the King Charles spaniel (left) is looking for a home, while Biscuit (right) has been turned down for adoption 5,000 times since arriving at the home's Berkshire branch in February 2014 . Border Collie Dillon is another of the 180 pets who are spending the festive period at the rescue centre . Each year, a handful of workers postpone their turkey dinners to tend to the animals residing here and at other shelters across the country. Among the pets are those who have been rescued in the run-up to Christmas, who will be treated to renditions of Silent Night and donated toys. But there are also those who will be spending their second Christmas at the centre, after being rejected for adoption thousands of times over the past 12 months. Ros Davies is one of those who will be manning the Battersea home today. Although she works as a rehomer in the cattery, she spends Christmas Day playing Saint Nick instead. Ms Davies said: 'We're full at the moment. There's 83 pens in the cattery and they've all got at least one cat in them. 'A lot of people very kindly donated toys and treats for the cats, so we've got a big pile of presents to give out to them ... We dish 'em all out so that there's enough for every cat, and some left over.' Ms Davies said the cats got into the Christmas spirit early this year,  with stockings outside each pen and the cattery being decked out in beautiful decorations which are 'much better than the dogs'. Meanwhile, over in the kennels, canine welfare trainer Nathalie Ingham has been playing carols to keep her charges from fretting. She said: 'We've got nice calm Christmas songs going at the moment. Silent Night, stuff like that.' Nathalie Ingham, the canine welfare trainer, will be keeping Honey, the Bull Mastiff, company tpday . Wini, a Northern Inuit (left) and Eve, a Staffordshire Bull Terrier, are two of the dogs looking for homes . Laura Cushy, one of the rehomers, pictured with Lola, who has been waiting for a home for two months . She was hoping for a white Christmas this year, an added adventure for the mischievous animals. She said: 'It's really nice to see how they respond to things like snow - some dogs are just mesmerised by it and don't quite understand what they're walking on. 'Others just go crazy for snow and have loads of fun charging around. It's a nice time of year to be here, lots of different things, and everyone's a bit more laid-back,' she said. Rehomer Laura Cushway has one Christmas present in mind. She has her fingers crossed that one of the 'long-stays' will find a home these holidays - like Lola, who spends her nights in foster care but has been waiting patiently for a permanent home for more than two months. But Lola has nothing on Biscuit, in the home's Old Windsor branch in Berkshire, who has now spent more than half his life waiting for a home. Sydney is a one-and-a-half-year-old Mongrel who has not yet tempted any prospective dog owners . Mini, a Northern Inuit, is another of the 'long-stays' who has been listening to Silent Night at the centre . Gabriel the Labrador does not have a permanent home. There is no time limit on how a dog or cat can spend at the centre . The two-year-old mongrel arrived as a stray in February 2013 and has watched on as nearly 5,000 other dogs have found new homes. Making a last-ditch pre-Christmas plea this week, the Old Windsor centre's manager Kaye Mughal said: 'It's unbelievable Biscuit still hasn't found a home when he's such a beautiful and fun-loving dog who would fit in perfectly with a family. 'Every day we hope someone will call us wanting to meet him, but poor Biscuit is constantly rejected and hasn't had any interest. We really thought he'd find a home before Christmas.' There is no time limit on how long a dog or cat can spend looking for a new home at Battersea, but anything more than a few months is unusual. 'We used to have dogs who stayed for a year,' Ms Cushway said. 'Now, three or four months is a long stay for us.' Intake co-ordinator Woody Woodford-Price said he would be having 'more or less' his first Christmas off since he joined Battersea 14 years ago. Ros Davies, pictured with one of the cats at the home, is one of those manning the Battersea centre today . Five-month-old Springer Spaniel Buster needs a new home. The centre takes 1,300 calls per month regarding animals who need to be rehomed . Staffordshire Bull Terrier Zarrow. The centre expects more animals to arrive in January, after Christmas . When a family decides they can no longer keep a pet at home, Mr Woodford-Price is their first contact at the home. He deals with at least 1,300 calls a month and says they run the gamut from the heartbreaking to the slightly perplexing. 'There have been cases where dogs haven't matched the sofa, things like that, they've been different colours. That does happen as well. Or it just doesn't fit in with their lifestyle. 'People do buy these things as fashion accessories, and it's not, of course,' he said. 'For this time of year, some people are looking to rehome their animals because they're going away for Christmas - they've got parties planned and they want to bring their animals in to the home.' Come January or February, he will be bracing for another wave of puppies and kittens that were given as ill-advised gifts. 'People don't realise how much it's actually going to cost to feed an animal, the time that's involved ... Like children, they have to be fed, kept clean, with fresh water and food and of course medical treatment as well,' he said. But he is also expecting a surge of people to make the post-holiday decision to open their homes. Cat rehomer Ms Davies said she is expecting up to 40 cats to be snapped up this weekend alone. 'Most of our cats will fly out of here,' she said.","Handful of workers will spend Christmas looking after the rescue animals .

"Ride sharing service Uber has issued an apology after it jacked up prices as frightened Sydneysiders fled last week's siege at Martin Place. With police calls to evacuate the area, demand for Uber outstripped its supply of cars, kicking in an automatic price surge to attract more cars to the area.

The company said it wanted to help get as many people as possible out of the CBD, but it communicated its intentions poorly, leading to misunderstanding about its motives. 'We didn't stop surge pricing immediately,' Uber said in its statement. 'This was the wrong decision.'

And none more so than Justin Scheman, who spent six weeks and $2,500 planning a proposal based on the hit TV show The Amazing Race. The Phoenix radio producer whisked his girlfriend Diana Bishop away on a 5,000 mile clue-chasing trip - spanning six US states and two countries and ending with him getting down on one knee beneath the Northern Lights in Iceland. Scroll down for video . Elaborate: Radio producer Justin Scheman gets down on one knee in Iceland underneath the Northern Lights . She said yes! At the end of his intricate proposal, which was based on the hit TV show The Amazing Race, Diana Bishop agrees to be his wife . His meticulous plan involved tricking his girlfriend into thinking she was a contestant on an online edition of the Amazing Race - a show the couple has watched religiously since it was first aired. The multi-Emmy Award-winning reality series pits 11 teams, each comprised of two members, against each other on a trek around the world for approximately 25 days. The Amazing Race is a multi-Emmy Award-winning reality series hosted by Phil Keoghan, which pits 11 teams, each comprised of two members, against each other on a trek around the world for approximately 25 days. At every destination, each team must compete in a series of challenges, some mental and some physical, and only when the tasks are completed will they learn of their next location. Teams who are the farthest behind will gradually be eliminated as the contest progresses, with the first team to arrive at the final destination winning $1 million. Source: CBS . At every destination, each team must compete in a series of challenges and the first team to arrive at the final destination wins $1 million. Mr Scheman took his fiancée through challenges just as she would if she was a contestant on the popular show - but over just 24 hours. The plan, which was captured on video, ended with the couple embracing under the Aurora Borealis. Mr Scheman said that it was not until the couple were on their way to Iceland that he revealed the whole thing was a ruse. Speaking to the Huffington Post, he said: 'When she realized CBS didn't set up that race she was floored! 'She kept kissing me and squeezing me. It was so cute, I wish the camera was rolling! She couldn't believe I was so detailed. 'With the pull-tab envelope, the way the clues were written, the arrows posted on the streets, real release forms, etc. I even used the same cars they use on the show.'

I just started talking, grabbed the wrong hand, and I just started crying like a baby. He added: 'It's not that much effort for somebody you love when you say I would do anything for you, don't say it, do it, go out and do it.

"Excited fans flocked to YouTube on Christmas Eve to rent  The Interview after Sony posted the film online to thwart hackers' attempts to prevent its release. The controversial comedy, which depicts an assassination attempt on the North Korean leader, was available to rent or purchase on several websites in the U.S, with viewers forking out a minimum of $6 to watch it from start to finish. Within hours it had been viewed more than 10,000 times, with viewers sharing their reviews on social media afterwards. Overnight other fans visited cinemas to view the film in person, with some donning Christmas outfits for the occasion. Scroll down for video . Within hours of being uploaded online more than 10,000 fans shared their praise of the film on social media . It comes as cinema chains across the country pulled out of plans to show the film amid 'security concerns' after hackers published scores of confidential information from Sony's database. American authorities accused North Korea of the breach which leaked private emails and exchanges, and urged Sony to release the film as planned despite threats. President Obama later praised the company's decision not to halt the film's release. 'As the president made clear, we are a country that believes in free speech, and the right of artistic expression,' a statement given by his spokesman said. 'The decision made by Sony and participating theatres allows people to make their own choices about the film, and we welcome that outcome.' Yesterday the film's stars James Franco and Seth Rogan took to social media to announce it would be made available online. Within hours of it being uploaded, the film had been viewed more than 10,000 times. The majority of viewers gave it a 'thumbs up' on Youtube, with around 800 giving it a poor review. Among the first verdicts was praise for its comedic value and warnings about expletive language. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg who starred and produced the film introduce its release in L.A. on Christmas Day . James Franco announced the film's online release yesterday on his Instagram page to the delight of fans . Fans rushed to social media to share their verdict of the film which was released online yesterday afternoon . 'Hey North Korea... I just watched the Interview and I laughed by butt off!!! Thanks YouTube!!' said one happy customer, while another said paying $5.99 to watch the film was 'totally worth it.' Last week Sony fell victim to one of the most destructive cyber-attacks in recent memory. Among information released was a chain of emails between co-chair Amy Pascal and producer Scott Rudin who made racially insensitive remarks about President Obama's film tastes. A further series of  internal documents were also made public, ranging from plans for the upcoming James Bond film, to internal emails arguing over the company's direction, to discussion of past theatrical failures. Pascal has been especially embarrassed by the leaks, recently having emails released revealing that things are so bad between the actor and the studio in fact that Sony head Amy Pascal calls him an 'a**hole* not once, but twice in emails exchanges. She also believed Idris Elba should be cast as the next James Bond. Meanwhile Angelina Jolie was referred to as a 'a minimally talented spoiled brat' in one exchange discussing the star's passion project remake of Cleopatra. While a select view were able to watch the film without a glitch, others endured server crashes and disrupted connections due in part to a surge in traffic. 'Well after 3 server crashes on You Tube... finished The Interview... it wasn't bad. It is at times filled with adult situations, language R (rated)!' said another viewer. The film cannot be viewed online in Europe or Asia. Scores of cinemas in America will still show the film, with many Christmas Day showings already sold-out. Organisers said they would take extra safety measures in light of the film's controversy. 'When a film attracts this kind of hype, there has to be concerns,"" said Greg Laemmle, co-owner and president of Laemmle, an art house chain with several theaters in Los Angeles. 'As long as we're not being irresponsible in terms of addressing patron safety, we really need to support freedom of artistic expression.' While North Korea has denied it is responsible for the cyberattack on Sony, it supported calls for the film to be banned. Yesterday a photograph of the country's leader Kim Jong-Un wearing makeup swept social media, with those sharing the image proclaiming: 'You can't silence our freedom of speech'. The film, which depicts an assassination attempt on the North Korean leader, has attracted wide controversy .

"Shelley-Marie Sumner and her boyfriend Dean Williams, who encouraged her to enter her first beauty pageant . A woman who was subjected to a bullying ordeal due to her severe eczema has hit back against her tormentors - by being becoming a top beauty queen. Shelley-Marie Sumner, 23, endured daily taunts of 'snake skin' throughout school due to the condition which affected her face and body and it left her desperately under-confident and considering self-harm. But the dance teacher refused to cower away after she left school and when her eczema eased off she entered a local beauty pageant at the suggestion of her boyfriend. Now she has had the last laugh after she was crowned Miss Black Country and went on to compete in the Miss England pageant. Ms Sumner, 23, from Walsall, West Midlands said: 'I was picked on every day at school because of my eczema and it shattered my confidence. I never dreamed I would have the courage to enter a beauty pageant, let alone win, but I've finally shown the bullies that their words won't hold me back any more.' She was born with sore red patches of eczema covering her body and although doctors told her mother Tracey-Marie that she would grow out of it, the condition only got worse. By the time she was a toddler, she was covered from head to toe in eczema. 'It was really severe. My skin was always sticky and when my hair started to grow long, I had to have it cut short so it wouldn't get stuck to the eczema on my neck. 'It was in my eyes and the creases of my arms and legs. Mum used to bandage my hands up at night so I couldn't scratch myself in my sleep. I still try to sleep in gloves now to stop myself scratching, because it's become such a habit.' 'In primary school it wasn't as bad as you're only children, but at high school the bullying got much worse. People would try and get away from me like I was contagious. We had to wear long-sleeved shirts so during the summer, I was always going to see the school nurse to put my eczema cream on and cool down. 'That definitely didn't help. Most of the bullying was during PE lessons when I wore shorts and everyone could see the rash all over my legs. I hated it - I always tried to get out of PE, which I regret now. 'I sometimes got prank calls where the bullies would just laugh and hang up on me. I was tiny too, so they called me 'Anorexic Annie'. As a child you can't forget the name-calling. 'I never had a lot of friends. At my lowest point I was seeing the school counsellor. I had serious trust issues,' she says. Shelley-Marie Sumner poses for a photo wearing her Miss Black Country winner's sash . The 23-year-old said she was terrified when taking part in the Miss Black Country competition. Here she is pictured wearing her winner's tiara and sash (left) and backstage before walking the catwalk (right) Ms Sumner often went to see a dermatologist as a teenager in an attempt to soothe her sore skin, but never found the 'wonder product' she was hoping for. She said: 'I've tried lots of types of aloe vera creams, cocoa butter, steroid cream. Some of them seemed like the answer but as soon as my skin got used to them, they'd stop working. I've spent a shocking amount of time and money searching for the right skin products, because I have to be so careful with what I put on my face.' By her late teens, the eczema started to die down on its own and she started dating Dean Williams, 23, who assured her she was beautiful. Mr Williams, as well as her family, persuaded the shy blonde to enter the regional beauty pageant last year. She said: 'I never thought I would have the confidence to do a pageant, but I had read that they involved a lot of charity work. I decided that even if I didn't do well, it would be good to do something for charity and it would give me more confidence. But in the end I don't know what made me apply. Something in me just said 'give it a go'. Shelley-Marie Sumner pictured as a child with the eczema already visible on her face and arms . She often went to see a dermatologist as a teenager in an attempt to soothe her sore skin (pictured), but never found the 'wonder product' she was hoping for. It eventually died down naturally . After taking part in an interview, she was told she'd made the final, which took place in February 2014. She said: 'Walking down the catwalk in the final was really frightening. I suffer from anxiety so it felt like a huge amount of pressure, but I knew how proud my family would be. 'When it was time to reveal the winner I started taking my shoes off, knowing I hadn't won, and then they announced my name and started playing 'The World's Greatest' by R Kelly. You should have seen my face. 'It was completely mad. I was sitting on a throne with this big crown on and my family were staring at me in amazement. I was extremely happy to have won it. It felt amazing to show the bullies what I could achieve, despite all their cruelty.' Ms Sumner was crowed Miss Black Country (left) after being urged to enter the competition by her boyfriend Dean Williams (pictured together right) After being crowned Miss Black Country, she went on to compete in the Miss England pageant in May, finishing in the top 20. Here she is pictured with her mother (centre) and sister (right) After being crowned Miss Black Country, she went on to compete in the Miss England pageant in May, finishing in the top 20. But her skin condition flared up yet again, nearly stopping her from taking part in the competition, held at Kelham Hall in Nottinghamshire. She said: 'Two weeks before the final,  I developed shingles in my eye socket. I was devastated, but I'd obviously been overdoing it and was feeling the strain. 'I ended up in hospital for four days and the doctors advised me not to do the pageant but I made them give me a steroid cream so I could go ahead with it. I didn't want to miss the opportunity. Thankfully my rash had faded when the final came around, but I still didn't feel back to full health.' Since winning Miss Black Country, she has raised £700 for a local children's charity and works as an ambassador for her local area. Although Ms Sumner still battles bouts of eczema, becoming a beauty queen has shown her that her condition can't hold her back from achieving her dreams. 'Since doing Miss Black Country, getting involved in charity work and seeing how well I am compared to other people, it makes me feel lucky to even be here. In the future I'd like to go into schools and talk about bullying and self-esteem. I want to urge victims to speak up and not suffer in silence like I did.'","Shelley-Marie Sumner, 23, endured daily taunts throughout school life .

"Michelle Obama today shared a snap of Christmas past as she wished the nation a happy holiday. The first lady tweeted a photograph on Thursday afternoon showing her with President Obama in their younger years, with the message: 'Merry Christmas!' In the image, which is not dated, the young couple are standing beside a Christmas tree that is a slightly less impressive than the one at their home today. She shared her message online as she celebrated Christmas day by singing carols and opening gifts with her husband and their daughters at their vacation home in Hawaii. The White House said Obama started the holiday on Christmas Eve by having dinner with friends, his wife and daughters before telephoning troops who are stationed overseas for the holidays. Younger years: Michelle Obama has shared this photo to Twitter with the message: 'Merry Christmas!' In the calls, he thanked the troops for their service and the sacrifice they and their families make. Later on Thursday, as is their tradition, Obama and his wife were planning to visit with troops and their families at a Marine Corps base in Hawaii. On Christmas Eve, White House photographer, Pete Souza, shared another rather festive snap of the commander-in-chief - showing him wearing a jewel-encrusted tiara with a Girl Scouts troop. The image, which was actually taken with the troop from Tulsa, Oklahoma at the annual White House Science Fair in May, was shared by Souza on his Instagram page on Christmas Eve. He explained that he came across the image while editing his images from 2014. ABC News noted that the smiling youngsters managed to get Obama to do something the Navy football team had been unable to do in April - wear a headdress. The Navy had presented Obama with a custom-fit helmet but he refused to try it on. 'Here's the general rule: You don't put stuff on your head if you're president,' Obama said at the time. 'That's politics 101. You never look good wearing something on your head.' Also on Christmas Eve, the White House shared a photograph of Michelle Obama speaking to children on the phone for the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and its super-popular Santa tracking program. Festive: A Girl Scout troop from Tulsa, Oklahoma convinced President Obama to don a tiara during their trip to the White House in May. The image was shared by his official photographer on Christmas Ev . The first couple passed on their good wishes to the country in Obama's weekly address, and called upon the nation to give thought to the troops and their families. The president added that the celebration of the birth of Jesus was a reminder of a message 'that has changed the world: to reach out to the sick; the hungry; the troubled; and above all else, to love one another as we would be loved ourselves.' On Christmas Eve, Mrs Obama had spent the day away from her husband on the fifth day of their traditional Hawaiian getaway so that they could both complete diplomatic duties and be with their daughters on Christmas Day. While his wife was volunteering, the President enjoyed a game of golf with Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak. Obama and Najib teed off Wednesday on a cloudy but balmy afternoon at a Marine Corps base on Oahu, not far from where Obama is renting a home for his two-week stay. The two leaders seemed at ease together, smiling and laughing in casual clothes as they sized up their shots. Although Obama plays golf nearly every day while on vacation, he typically restricts his foursome to a small circle of longtime friends and advisers. Star volunteer: First Lady Michelle Obama reacts while talking on the phone to children across the country from Hawaii as part of the annual NORAD Tracks Santa program, which kids call to see where Santa is . Mixing business and pleasure: US President Barack Obama he plays golf with Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razzak at Marine Corps Base Hawaii on Christmas Eve . 'The two leaders took the opportunity to discuss the growing and warming relationship between the United States and Malaysia,' the White House said in a statement . But in recent years, his annual trip to Hawaii has allowed Obama to mix in a little diplomacy. Last year, he hit the links with New Zealand Prime Minister John Key, who owns a home in Hawaii. Media access to Obama's golf games is typically restricted, but reporters and photographers were permitted to briefly watch the two leaders Wednesday about halfway through their game. Neither leader was having particularly good luck with their short game. Up first to finish the hole, Najib came up short with his putt. Obama crouched low to line up his shot, but the ball tilted left and evaded the hole. After another failed attempt, he picked up the ball and called it quits. Najib, too, missed his next shot, but a gracious Obama gave him a pat on the shoulder and praised his golf game just the same. 'Merry Christmas,' Obama said as he waved to the media. In April, Obama paid the first presidential visit to Malaysia in nearly half a century, when Lyndon B. Johnson visited the Southeast Asian nation . U.S. President Barack Obama puts his putter in the bag after he and Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak played on the 18th green at the Clipper Golf course on Marine Corps Base Hawaii on December 24 . Then he added a note of caution for reporters covering his Hawaiian getaway. 'Be careful about those fruity drinks,' he said. 'You never know - they might have a little kick to them.' Ever the statesmen, Obama and Najib also used their time on the course to discuss world affairs, including Malaysia's rotating leadership next year of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN. 'The two leaders took the opportunity to discuss the growing and warming relationship between the United States and Malaysia,' the White House said in a statement. Najib has served as Malaysia's prime minister since 2009. In April, Obama paid the first presidential visit to Malaysia in nearly half a century, when Lyndon B. Johnson visited the Southeast Asian nation. During that visit, Obama met with Najib and pressed his government to improve its human rights and political freedoms. Vacation: President Obama, his wife and daughters Sasha and Malia disembark Air Force One  after arriving at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam for their annual family Christmas vacation last Friday . Obama is no stranger to Hawaii's picturesque golf courses, and this year's vacation has been par for the course. The president has played a round four out of the five days he's been on the island so far. Michelle, meanwhile, was busy helping NORAD, which uses the heat signature from Rudolph's nose to 'track' St. Nick over spots ranging from Australia to South America and on to the United States. She volunteers each year. While other volunteers work from an operations center in Colorado, Michelle works remotely from Hawaii each year. She spent 30 minutes answering calls from children. This year, Obama fielded a half-dozen calls while Santa was swooping down in Italy, Kosovo and the Czech Republic. Heartwarming: NORAD volunteers take phone calls from children around the world asking where Santa is and when he will deliver presents to their homes at Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado . NORAD and USNORTHCOM Chief of Staff Maj. Gen. Charles D. Luckey joins other volunteers taking phone calls  during the annual NORAD Tracks Santa Operation . 'Do you believe in Santa?' asked Sara, an 8-year-old from Ontario, Canada. Mrs. Obama replied that she did ? and the president does, too. 'That's why I try to be good all year. I try to help other people and eat my vegetables, and be kind to all the kids that I know because I believe that Santa is watching,' the first lady said. Kids can call 877-HI-NORAD or email noradtrackssanta@outlook.com on Christmas Eve and an operator will tell them exactly where Santa is based on their tracking system. The program is based at a control center at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs. Last year the website received 19.5 million hits, while volunteers fielded 117,000 phone calls and answered 9,600 emails. The website was launched in 1997. Typically, NORAD defends the skies and monitors the sea approaches for the US and Canada.","White House photographer Pete Souza shared a snap of President Obama wearing a tiara surrounded by a Girl Scout troop from Oklahoma .

"This stunning set of pictures shows an intense battle between a seal and octopus - in which the seal emerges as the winner by gulping the octopus down in one. The hungry seal spots the octopus and decides that it would make a great breakfast, so goes in for the killer move. But the little octopus puts up a fight by wriggling about and wrapping its clingy tentacles around the seal's face. Scroll down for video . Sea-ing is believing: A stunning set of pictures shows an intense battle between a seal and octopus - in which the seal emerges as the winner by gulping the octopus down in one . Hungry: The seal spots the octopus and decides that it would make a great breakfast, so goes in for the killer move . The little octopus put up a fight by wriggling about and wrapping its clingy tentacles around the seal's face - but it was all in vain . After a long struggle, the big seal got the better of the sea animal and gulped him down in one. These spectacular photos were taken by photographer Andrew Lee whilst he visited the Bolsa Chica Wetlands in Huntington Beach, California, USA. The 53-year-old, from California, visited the area before sunrise and only intended to picture pelicans diving for smelts. However, Andrew was stunned at around 8am when he saw a lone seal making its way into the Bolsa Chica inlet from the ocean - causing a 'chaotic atmosphere' among the birds. All the pelicans flew off into the distance and Andrew decided to photograph the seal. When the excitement calmed down Andrew decided to gamble on one more shot of the seal before he set off. He said: 'As the activities at the bridge winded down, I walked towards my car to go home. Then I decided to take a chance and walked west towards the gate. Tactic: The seal flung the octopus around to kill it as it was proving too difficult to swallow while it was alive and struggling . The epic battle played out off Huntington Beach in California, as stunned photographer Andrew Lee looked on . The seal caused a huge commotion as it desperately tried to swallow the defiant octopus . Photographer Mr Lee explained that the seal eventually had to kill the octopus before gulping it down in one . Water sight: The seal is finally getting to grips with its slippery prey, which put up a brave fight . Mr Lee said that he felt extremely privileged to witness the 'extraordinary' aquatic battle, which he said lasted 'quite a while' 'I was hoping to catch the seal there hunting instead of going out back to the ocean. I was not disappointed, as I walked closer to the gate, I could see the seal's head bobbing up and down near the inlet. 'I could see that the seal was diving down then surfacing, again and again, as if he was fighting with something. 'It turned out it was an octopus that the seal just caught. 'The octopus wrapped himself tightly around the seal's face: his eight tentacles completely covered the seal's nose and mouth - I thought I was seeing some kind of sea monster. 'The epic battle lasted a while as the seal tried desperately to position the octopus to swallow. 'The octopus, to his credit, fought hard not to be beaten (and eaten), clinging and wrapping his tenacious tentacles with big suckers around the seal. I had never witnessed anything like this before. 'The seal continually dived then surfaced then dived again in an effort to dislodge the octopus. He finally succeeded and was able to grab hold of one of the octopus's tentacles. Gloating: Mr Lee said that the seal appeared to go on a victory parade around the inlet after it swallowed the octopus . 'As if punishing or toying with the octopus, the seal shook his head vigorously left and right then right and left, flinging the octopus around him liked a frisbee. It was a sight to behold. 'The seal then flipped the octopus high in the air and tried to swallow him. But the octopus proved that he was not such an easy prey. 'The mouth of the seal was filled with the slippery octopus, with all of his eight tentacles spread out. 'The seal could not swallow the octopus so he spat him out and then started tenderizing his meal again by flinging his lunch back and forth, back and forth. 'After several attempts, the seal was able to kill the octopus. 'In the grand finale, the seal triumphantly tossed the now deceased rival in the air, opened his mouth wide, and in one gulf, swallowed the octopus. 'He then swam around the gate inlet several times as if he was in a victory parade. 'I was left speechless and very excited to be lucky enough to witness such an extraordinary event.'","A photographer spoke of his amazement after seeing a seal engaged in an epic battle with a defiant octopus .

"This man, known only as X, had his sentence for carrying a knife delayed so he could go on holiday, where he was involved in a fatal stabbing . A convicted thug’s sentence for carrying a knife was delayed so that he could go on holiday abroad – where he was then involved in the fatal stabbing of a British teenager. The 19-year-old was given a ten-week curfew and ordered to wear a tag at all times by District Judge Dennis Lynch. But The Mail on Sunday can now reveal he then permitted an 11-day suspension, so the youth could go on holiday. Four days later, the youth – referred to only as ‘X’ for legal reasons – was involved in a brawl outside a bar in Malia, Crete, during which Tyrell Matthews-Burton, from Leyton, East London, was fatally stabbed through the heart. Tyrell’s mother, Sharon Matthews, says she is ‘shocked’ by the revelation and one family source says, had the curfew not been suspended, her son may have still been alive, as X played a ‘crucial role’ in the brawl. X, who has been charged with affray by Greek police, was one of 17 British youths arrested in connection with the brawl. Police in Malia are still unclear as to what triggered the brawl outside the Safari club in the early hours of July 22 last year. John Kostadoudakis, a lawyer in Athens acting for Ms Matthews, said Tyrell and his friends and members of X’s group were all inside the bar when an argument broke out, possibly over a girl. It appears that when Tyrell – who was in Crete to celebrate his 19th birthday – was leaving the bar, he was set upon by the group and stabbed. Despite paramedics’ attempts to save him, he died at the scene. Within hours, Greek police had arrested 17 British youths in the resort, some with blood still smeared on their clothes. Had the incident taken place in Britain, the entire group could have been charged with murder under the law of joint enterprise, in which all gang members are responsible for a murder even if one person struck the fatal blow. This concept does not exist in Greek law. The thug (left) has now been charged with affray after Tyrell Matthews-Burton died after a knife attack outside a club in Malia, Greece. Myles Litchmore-Dunbar (right) has been charged with the killing . One of Tyrell’s alleged attackers, Myles Litchmore-Dunbar, 19, from Catford, South-East London, has been charged with murder, which he denies. Two others – Dejon Anaughe, 19, and Jordan Williams, 19 – have been charged with being accomplices to murder. Five more – including ‘X’ – have been charged with affray. They have been allowed to return to the UK until a trial date is set. Myles Litchmore-Dunbar, 19, from Catford, South-East London, denies the murder . The Mail on Sunday has seen a confidential letter from the Ministry of Justice to Labour MP Stella Creasy, in which Justice Minister Sailesh Vara reveals Judge Lynch’s extraordinary decision. ‘I am extremely concerned,’ said Miss Creasy, the MP for Walthamstow. ‘This man was sentenced for the possession of a knife, and then allowed to go on holiday where he became involved in an incident where someone was stabbed to death. Questions need to be asked.’ X appeared before Judge Lynch at Bromley Magistrates’ Court in Kent on July 17 last year. According to Mr Vara’s letter and a separate summary of the proceedings obtained by this newspaper from the court, X was arrested twice on the same day a week earlier in separate incidents in the Forest Hill area of South-East London. He was charged with cannabis possession and for carrying a folding pocket knife with a 3in blade. X pleaded guilty to both charges in court. Judge Lynch did not sentence him for the cannabis possession but imposed a ten-week-long curfew, requiring he wear a tag and remain inside his house between 8pm and 6am each night. He ordered that the sentence start immediately, but X’s lawyer asked if it could be suspended between July 19-30 so X could go on a pre-booked holiday. The judge gave permission. Four days later, X was in Malia with at least eight friends. Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, added: ‘This is an extraordinary case. The judge’s decision to suspend a curfew to enable a defendant to go on holiday has been most unwise. The Lord Chief Justice should revisit sentencing guidelines to ensure these circumstances are never repeated.’ Writing in this newspaper today, Tyrell’s mother, a 43-year-old housing officer, said: ‘This is a complete shock. How can a judge allow a person convicted of such a serious offence to go on holiday before serving their sentence?’ Since his return to the UK, X has been arrested in South London for possession of cannabis as well as a fraud-related offence. Crime scene: Police are still at a loss as to exactly what started the brawl outside the Safari club (pictured) on July 22 last year but believe an argument may have started over a girl . In May, police in Scotland charged him with possession of heroin and crack cocaine. He is on bail while he awaits trial. This weekend Judge Lynch – who was appointed in 2004 and sits in courts in South-East London – could not be contacted for comment. A spokesman for the Judicial Communications Office, which acts of behalf of judges, said: ‘Judges are obliged to follow sentencing guidelines. 'Court documents show that the defendant had immediately pleaded guilty to possession of cannabis and a knife. He had no previous convictions. He had been on bail since his arrest and had committed no further offences.’ My son was killed on his 19th birthday... I need to know why, by Sharon Matthews . What does it mean to lose a child to a senseless murder? How do I feel? Imagine your child, cold and unresponsive to your touch. Imagine wanting to celebrate their birthday, only for it to be the date of their death. I sent my son on holiday, not to war. Tyrell was in Malia, Crete, celebrating his 19th birthday with friends and due home two days later. On July 21, the day before his birthday, we spoke on the phone. He said he was having a good time. I told him I loved him and to take care. Mother Sharon Matthews (left) with her 'precious son' Tyrell (right) who was stabbed to death on holiday . Next day I tried to call to wish him happy birthday but kept getting his voicemail. I was not worried, I assumed he’d been out the night before and was sleeping. I headed off to work and, at lunchtime, went shopping. I was at the chemists when my world was destroyed. My nephew called with the news: ‘Tyrell was injured in a fight.’ ‘Is he OK?’ I murmured. Silence, then: ‘No, I don’t think so.’ In the middle of Boots, in Stratford, East London, I started to scream and fell to my knees. A security guard came to my aid and soon my colleagues and two police officers were by my side. Two more officers arrived and said Tyrell had been stabbed to death outside a club in Malia on his 19th birthday. In the immediate aftermath, the press described it as a gang-fight. But this was contrary to Tyrell’s values and beliefs. He was charming and handsome – he could light up a room. He seemed confident, but was actually slightly shy and very humble. Two days later, I went to Greece to identify his body. In the hospital mortuary, I held him, willing him to wake up, praying he would open his eyes when he realised Mum was there. I touched his wounds, kissed his face and held his hands. The nightmare was finally real. I returned to the UK, and went to collect my daughter Savannah, then five, from her grandmother. ‘Where’s TyTy?’ she asked, looking behind me. I could not find the words to tell her, so just said he wasn’t here. The disappointment in her face broke me. It is a year since Tyrell’s precious life was cut short. His death was senseless, brutal and unnecessary. Why would anyone want to hurt him? How can people go on holiday armed with knives? How could they leave him in the street to die? Last week, my local MP Stella Creasy told me one of the men involved in the brawl leading to my son’s death was convicted of carrying a knife four days earlier. Yet a judge suspended his ten-week-long curfew for almost two weeks so he could go on holiday. This is a complete shock. How can a judge allow a person convicted of such a serious offence to go on holiday before serving their sentence? I am hurt and disappointed. Hurt, because there is no deterrent for such offences. Disappointed because it is a slap in the face for all the families of other young stabbing victims. It does not bode well for the future. Judges must be tough on all knife crime, for the sake of society. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Thug, known as X, was due to be sentenced for carrying a knife last year .

"Outspoken: Stephen Fry has never been shy about his opinions or his sexuality and wrote and open letter to number 10 claiming Putin was making scapegoats of gay people . David Cameron had a secret pub summit with Stephen Fry after  the actor called for a boycott of the Winter Olympics in Russia over its treatment of gay people. The two men met in a pub in London’s East End which is co-owned by Mr Fry’s fellow actor and gay rights campaigner Sir Ian McKellen. Mr Fry, a self-proclaimed bitter opponent of the Tories, challenged Mr Cameron after the Prime Minister said it was vital that Britain attend the Games in Sochi to make the  case for more gay rights in Russia. Well-placed sources said that at the end of the meeting – which took place in a private room at the back of The Grapes pub in trendy Limehouse – Mr Fry said he had a better understanding of Mr Cameron’s argument and thanked him for his assurances. ‘They had a very pleasant discussion,’ said one source. ‘Mr Cameron explained in detail why he thought we should attend the Games. ‘Mr Fry asked him how Britain would use its attendance to make the case for gay rights and seemed pleased at the replies he received.’ The extraordinary ‘gay rights pub summit’ between the actor and the Prime Minister on Monday evening came days after Mr Fry had written an open letter to No 10. He claimed that Russia’s . President Putin was making scapegoats of gay people, just as Hitler did with the Jews.  Mr Fry had made no attempt to conceal his lifelong disdain for  the Tories, although he praised the Prime Minister’s stance on gay rights in the UK. He had ‘instinctively disliked’ the Conservatives for most of his life, said Mr Fry. Campaigner: Stephen Fry speaking at a demonstration in Whitehalll last week during a protest against Russia's anti-gay stance . But he said that he had the ‘utmost respect’ for Mr Cameron’s support for gay marriage. ‘For that  I will always admire you, whatever other differences may lie between us,’ he wrote. ‘In the end I believe you know when a thing is wrong or right. Please act on that instinct now.’ He continued: ‘At all costs Putin cannot be seen to have the approval of the civilised world. The Summer Olympics of 2012 were one of the most glorious moments of my life and the life of my country. 'For  there to be a Russian Winter Olympics would stain the movement  for ever and wipe away any of  that glory.’ The Grapes pub in Limehouse, east London, where the pair had a 'very pleasant discussion' But he was rebuffed in a series  of tweets by the Prime Minister: ‘Thank you for your note @stephenfry. I share your deep concern about the abuse of gay people in Russia. ‘However, I believe we can better challenge prejudice as we attend, rather than boycotting the Winter Olympics. DC.’ Newspaper publisher Evgeny Lebedev, co-owner of The Grapes, invited Mr Fry to join him and Mr Cameron at the pub on Monday to thrash out their differences over a drink in a private room. Asked why Mr Cameron had agreed to meet  the actor, a No 10 source said: ‘The PM meets all sorts of people all the time. There is nothing unusual in him meeting Stephen Fry. ‘He was having dinner at the pub with Mr Lebedev who suggested  Mr Fry join them for drinks. The PM was happy to agree. It wasn’t a negotiation, it was a friendly discussion.’ Mr Fry also called on members of the public to back an anti-Russian gay rights protest in London planned for yesterday. ‘Lots of people popping down to Whitehall to make their feelings known. What to wear, what to  wear?’ he wrote on a social networking site.","Secret meeting took place in the pub's private back room .

Both videos have since been removed from Facebook. But Cruz also mentioned the happy news on Twitter, saying that he had taken an important step in his life and that he wants happiness for him and his partner as a couple.

"A tiny rural town in Utah put on its first-ever Christmas light parade this week in the latest gesture aimed at making the holidays special for a dying little girl. Addie Fausett, 6, watched the parade of floats Tuesday night in front of the small post office in Fountain Green, Utah, the Deseret News reports. It's there where nearly 300,000 Christmas cards from around the world have arrived in the last month for Addie, whose story had garnered attention across the country. Special moment: 6-year-old Addie Fausett is held by her mother, Tami Fausett, during the  light parade on Tuesday.  Nearly 300,000 Christmas cards from around the world have arrived in the last month for Addie . Addie has an undiagnosed illness that has halted her growth since she was 3 and is now causing cerebral atrophy. Doctors say she has less than one year to live. She hardly talks anymore, struggles to walk and sleep and weighs less than 25 pounds. She can't play with other kids because her illness causes behavior problems. Her grandmother came up with the idea to ask people from around the globe to send her Christmas cards to cheer Addie up. Days before the first Facebook post by grandma Maree Jensen, Addie told her mom she wanted friends like her two older sisters and to be able to laugh and play. Cards, letters and gifts have arrived from across the country and world — exceeding even the wildest expectations her family had when they came up with the idea. The flood of mail has been so much that the Fountain Green post office has had to get help from nearby post offices to sort it all. In addition to colorful cards, letters, stuffed animals and toys there have been monetary donations. Those have helped the family plan a dream trip for Addie: to Sea World in San Diego. Seasons greetings: Cards, letters and gifts have arrived from across the country and world  for Addie— exceeding even the wildest expectations her family had when they came up with the idea . Illness: Addie has an undiagnosed illness that has halted her growth since she was 3 and is now causing cerebral atrophy. Doctors say she has less than one year to live . Addie's mom, Tami Fausett, was touched by the parade — which capped off a whirlwind month for the family. She held Addie, bundled up in a white blanket, as the floats went by on main street in Fountain Green, population 1,000. It is about a 1 ½-hour drive south from Salt Lake City. 'I think it is really awesome that so many people want to come and do this, and so many people showed up to watch as well,' Tami Fausett said. Fountain Green resident Nathan Beck, whose family made two floats for the parade, said witnessing the community rally around Addie has restored his faith in humanity. 'I think it has changed the way people think about Christmas in this little town,' Beck said. Most of the floats were modest, made with a few lights and decorations, but it was still quite an event for the tiny community. 'I just worked with what I had, bought a few lights made a little float for her, put her name on it,' said resident Jerry Beck. 'We love her.'","A tiny rural town  put on its first-ever Christmas light parade this week in the latest gesture aimed at making the holidays special for a dying little girl .

"Colorado was the first state to legalize recreational marijuana sales. Now the state's voters may consider a ballot measure to allow pot smokers to carry a concealed firearm. The 'Colorado Campaign for Equal Gun Rights' is working to put a question on the November 2016 ballot to have Colorado ignore guidelines from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives about firearms and pot. The measure would change state law to prevent sheriffs from denying concealed carry permits because of marijuana use. It's a new frontier in the marijuana wars, and one that has divided gun-rights activists. Showing support: Edgar Antillon is one of the organizers of an effort to have a ballot measure placed before voters in the 2016 November election to allow marijuana users to carry concealed firearms . 'It's just ridiculous,' said Edgar Antillon, one of the campaign organizers, who argues that firearms aren't kept from alcohol drinkers. 'Somebody can get extremely drunk — Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and all week if they want — and they can still get a concealed carry permit.' He said he and his campaign partner, Isaac Chase, who run a firearm training business called 'Guns For Everyone,' are reaching out to gun rights groups for support, including those involved in last year's recall of two state senators who supported stricter firearm laws. Colorado organizers need more than 86,100 signatures to send the question to voters, and it's unclear whether Antillon's campaign will get enough support to launch. The campaign would put Colorado again in direct conflict with federal guidelines about the drug. In 2011, the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives sent states a directive to keep guns away from marijuana users. Earlier this year, Democratic Sen. John Walsh of Montana tried to change that, suggesting an amendment to bar federal prosecution of medical marijuana patients who own firearms. The amendment failed. The matter divides gun enthusiasts. The president of the Colorado State Shooting Association said his members would oppose letting pot users carry guns. Divided: Edgar Antillon argues pot smokers should be able to carry guns because drunk people can . 'Federal law prohibits the possession and use of marijuana and its derivatives, and therefore its possession and use is incompatible with legal, responsible firearms ownership,' said Tony Fabian, president of the Colorado State Shooting Association. The County Sheriffs of Colorado are lining up against the idea, too. But it's an open debate whether marijuana-using gun owners are more dangerous than others — or even how many people lose gun rights over pot. Colorado keeps no data on the question. And the Colorado Bureau of Investigation, which runs background checks for applicants and gun buyers, doesn't track how many are denied concealed carry permits because of pot. Neither does the County Sheriffs of Colorado. Drugs and guns: Firearm trainers are staging a campaign to have a question put on the November 2016 ballot asking voters to change state law to prevent sheriffs from using marijuana use as a reason to deny a permit . People are asked, under oath, 14 questions on Colorado's concealed carry application, including whether the person has a restraining order, has been convicted of a felony, or has been treated for alcoholism within the past 10 years. They're also asked if they're 'an unlawful user of' marijuana 'or any other controlled substance.' The application is processed by county sheriffs. The conflict has surfaced in other states that allow medical or recreational marijuana use, including Washington and Oregon. In Washington state, forms for concealed weapons permits also ask if someone is an ""unlawful user"" of marijuana, without differentiating between state or federal law. In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal from an Oregon sheriff who had been prohibited from denying a concealed handgun license to a medical marijuana user. The decision meant the woman and other medical marijuana cardholders could obtain concealed handgun licenses. Antillon, whose company provides the firearm training required for concealed carry applicants, said several students have told him they've been denied a permit because they use marijuana, either medically or recreationally. He said it's unjust that marijuana users are being 'punished and can't defend their lives.' He argues that marijuana users can also be responsible firearm owners. 'It's going to be that initial battle of educating people. The challenge is people thinking that we're allowing people who are high to possess handguns,' he said.","The 'Colorado Campaign for Equal Gun Rights' is working to put a question on the November 2016 ballot to allow Colorado pot smokers to carry guns .

"Tony Pulis has been appointed head coach of West Bromwich Albion, replacing Alan Irvine who was sacked on Monday. The 56-year-old, who has been out of work since leaving his post at Crystal Palace before the season, has signed a two-and-a-half-year deal at The Hawthorns. And the former Stoke City and Crystal Palace boss was pictured arriving at Upton Park on New Year's Day, where he will watch his new side take on West Ham United from the directors' box alongside his trusted No 2 David Kemp. Tony Pulis (right) in the directors' box at Upton Park watching his new club West Bromwich Albion . Pulis signs a programme for a supporter before watching West Ham against West Brom . Tony Pulis arrives at Upton Park after being named as West Bromwich Albion's new head coach . The ex-Stoke City and Crystal Palace boss will watch West Brom's match with West Ham United from stands . Tony Pulis has taken over at West Brom after turning down the job at Newcastle United . Pulis has been out of work since leaving Crystal Palace before the start of the Premier League season . 'I'm absolutely delighted to accept the job and I do so with a simple but important message for the Albion fans and everyone at the club,' Pulis said. 'Every successful club is built on unity and that is what I shall strive to help bring to Albion. We need everyone together from top to bottom – the supporters, all the staff, the players, everyone who has an interest in the club's welfare. 'With that, we can go forward together and hopefully take this club up the Premier League.' West Brom technical director Terry Burton added: 'We are delighted to secure a man of Tony's calibre and proven ability. 'He made it clear that this position excited him and that he was eager to get back into the business of winning Premier League points - and there are few who know how to do it better.' Pulis is set to watch from the stands as West Brom play West Ham at Upton Park on New Year's Day . Pulis has replaced Alan Irvine who was sacked by the Baggies late on Monday night . Pulis takes over at West Brom with the club 16th in the Premier League, just one point above the relegation zone. Irvine was dismissed late on Monday night after a 2-0 defeat by Pulis's former club Stoke made it just a single win in nine games for West Brom. Pulis will charge of the team for the first time when Gateshead visit in the FA Cup on Saturday. Chairman Jeremy Peace has agreed to amend the Welshman's contract so he is satisfied he has total control of transfers - a potential stumbling block. It is clear Pulis, who takes the title 'head coach', will have a much greater role in player recruitment than predecessor Irvine, who came from an academy role. Record signing Brown Ideye has failed to impress since joining the Baggies in the summer . West Brom have tracked Blackburn midfielder Ben Marshall (right) but he would cost £3million . Pulis left Selhurst Park - having been named Manager of the Year for his relegation rescue mission - following a fallout over transfers. He will compile a list of  targets he hopes can help him maintain a remarkable record of never being relegated in 22 years as a manager. Peace had been focused on loan signings but is now expected to make funds available for permanent deals. On the way out are Sebastian Blanco, Jason Davidson, Georgios Samaras and Chris Baird. Record signing Brown Ideye, who cost £9million, has also failed to impress. Caretaker boss Rob Kelly is expected to leave the club when Pulis' arrival is officially announced . Technical director Burton retains his job and will help identify targets for Pulis but it remains to be seen how their relationship develops. Mervyn Day, head of recruitment, also stays. West Brom have been prioritising a new, mobile striker and want pace on both flanks. Another full-back would be welcome too. Ben Marshall, the Blackburn winger, has been tracked and would cost £3m, while Wigan's Callum McManaman could be available for £5m. Rob Kelly and Keith Downing will take charge of West Brom at Upton Park but both are likely to leave once Pulis brings in trusted assistants David Kemp, currently in Florida, and Gerry Francis.","Tony Pulis named as West Brom boss on day they face West Ham .

"A California couple who were left having to repay their daughter's crippling student loan debts when she died have revealed that they are finally debt free – five years after her untimely passing. Lisa Mason died suddenly in 2010 of liver failure at the age of 27, leaving behind three children – now aged nine, 12 and 14. As well as raising their grandchildren, Pastor Steve Mason, 59, and his wife Darnelle were saddled with $100,000 of debt because they had co-signed their daughter's loans for nursing school. Pastor Steve Mason, left, is finally rid of the crippling debts he was left responsible for after daughter Lisa suddenly died in 2010 from liver failure . Because the money had been borrowed from a private lender, instead of the federal government, they had no way for the debt to be canceled. After four years, the  debt had doubled to $200,000 because of high interest rates and late-fee penalties but now thanks to the help of CNN Money, donations from strangers and the generosity of the family's lawyer they are finally celebrating being debt free. 'We are just overwhelmed at the response,' said Darnelle. 'We can only hope that this wave [that the story] began will turn into a tsunami for all those other families that suffer as we do.' Steve Mason, who earns $75,000 a year salary as pastor at Oasis Church in Redlands, California, was struggling to pay off $2,000 a month in debt as well as feed three children. The salary has wife earned as director at the same church wasn't helping either. Pastor Mason had appealed to the lenders for help, but the couple were told the only solution was to repay the mammoth loans - some of which had interest rates of 12 percent - in full. Pastor Steve Mason, 59, and his wife Darnelle are raising their three grandchildren aged nine, 12 and 14 . Private lenders are not bound by federal regulations to provide assistance to those in financial difficulty - even when a family member has passed away. The family was running out of options after discovering that they couldn't declare bankruptcy because student loan debts can't be forgiven. In July, just as Mason was searching for a second job, CNN Money took up his case and suddenly things started to change. Senator Elizabeth Warren also highlighted the family's dire straits at a Banking Committee hearing. Suddenly the loan companies that had refused to negotiate with Pastor Mason were shamed into leniency and have now forgiven more than $60,000 in outstanding debt. The pastor also launched a GoFundMe page which has so far raised just over $41,000. The remaining $100,000 debt has now been whipped thanks to the generosity of the family's attorney David Fine. As well as raising their grandchildren, Pastor Steve Mason, 59, and his wife Darnelle were saddled with $100,000 of debt because they had co-signed their daughter's loans for nursing school . He has announced that he is waiving $100,000 in legal fees related to a lawsuit over Darnelle's death in a kind jesture to help the family pay off the rest. 'The tremendous emotional cost [of losing Lisa] was compounded by a sudden and colossal financial debt,' Fine told CNN Money. 'Offering a portion of our fee to the Masons provides a small amount of comfort and security to a wonderful family.' Money leftover from the settlement will now go directly to helping raise the Masons' grand kids. Generosity for the family also came in other ways, for instance a local orthodontist has offered to give free braces to the Masons' grandkids, while they also received $750 worth of toys. More than 210,000 people have also signed the family's Change.org petition urging lawmakers to require private student loan debt to be forgiven when the primary borrower dies.","Pastor Steve Mason, 59, and his wife Darnelle are finally rid of the crippling debts they were left with after their daughter Lisa suddenly died in 2010 .

They had just been out to celebrate a birthday and they just wanted to get home' Justice Hollingworth said Closter handed himself into police out of pragmatism rather than remorse, given the number of witnesses and surveillance video and said that Closter initially claimed he was acting in self-defence. 'What happened that night was entirely of your making,' the judge told the accused. 'The affray involved a violent, frightening and completely unprovoked attack by you and members of your group on another group, in the middle of the night, on a public street, at a busy time of year.

""Six years minimum, it'll never be enough, but it doesn't send a message of deterrence and punishment for a man who took my son's life' said David Cassai's mother Caterina Politi .","Dylan Closter was sentenced to nine years, three months in prison for the manslaughter of David Cassai, with a minimum term of six years .
Closter was 18 at the time of the attack on Cassai on New Year's Eve 2012 in the Victorian coastal town of Rye .
Cassai, 22, fell to the pavement after one punch and his skull was fatally fractured .
Closter and his friends launched 'a violent, frightening and completely unprovoked attack,' the sentencing judge said .

"Does religious affiliation contribute to happiness? A recent study by the Austin Institute for the Study of Family and Culture found that a strong correlation exists between religious affiliation and personal happiness. The institute surveyed a sample of 15,738 Americans between the ages of 18 and 60, according to the Breitbart News Network. Of the more than 15,000 sampled, 45 percent of those who attend a religious service on a weekly basis described themselves as 'very happy,' while only 28 percent of those who said they 'never' attend said the same. Study: A recent study by the Austin Institute for the Study of Family and Culture found that a strong correlation exists between religious affiliation and personal happiness (stock image) Data: Photographed is data obtained by the Institute detailing its findings which illustrate that those who attend a weekly religious service are happier than those who 'never' attend . Those who said they never attend religious services are twice as likely to say they are 'very unhappy' as those who attend services weekly. According to the study, this connection between religion and happiness stems from social support within the religious communities. Unhappy: Those who said they never attend religious services are twice as likely to say they are 'very unhappy' as those who attend services weekly (stock image) Being surrounded by friends and a congregation who share common beliefs and motivations is reportedly a key way in which faith and happiness connect. Though many other factors play a role, the study found that the sense of community among those who attend and engage in religious services is the most plausible theory to explain the connection. The link between faith and happiness is nothing new. Past studies -- both in America and overseas-- have found that, generally, those with a faith have higher levels of 'life satisfaction' than those without, BBC News reports. Key: Being surrounded by friends and a congregation who share common beliefs and motivations is reportedly a key way in which faith and happiness connect . Along with generally higher levels of happiness, BBC reports that studies find that religious people are better able to cope with difficult situations, such as losing a job or a divorce. The Austin Institute study included controlled variables such as self-reported physical health, marital status, age, educational attainment, race/ethnicity, gender, and marital happiness. But the end results proved that the statistics tying religious affiliation to happiness have held and are continuing to hold true.","A recent study by the Austin Institute for the Study of Family and Culture found that a strong correlation exists between religious affiliation and personal happiness .

"December was a rough month for Sony, as the movie studio was forced to sit back and watch as hackers released private emails from top executives, the personal information of thousands of  company employees, and then threatened a terrorist attack on American movie theaters, all in an attempt to get the studio to cancel the long planned Christmas release of their Kim Jong-un assassination comedy The Interview. Things finally turned around on Wednesday however, when Christmas came exactly one day early for Sony and the studio was able to declare victory over their hackers by releasing The Interview online. Making the release even sweeter for Sony was the massive outpouring of public support for the film, with thousands turning out for Christmas Eve midnight screenings across the country and tens of thousands of Americans streaming the film online. Guests at the Cinefamily theater's midnight showing in Los Angeles even got their own little holiday surprise  when the film's writers and directors, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, showed up to introduce the film and answer questions. Scroll down for videos . Surprise: Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen (above) surprised some fans in Los Angeles at the midnight showing of the film in the early morning hours of Thursday . Big business: This just hours after the film was officially released - online . Meanwhile, the film has taken over social media, with viewers eager to share their near uniform praise of the comedy, a development that no doubt restored a little holiday cheer in everyone involved in the production after critics found little to love about the movie. 'Hey North Korea... I just watched the Interview and I laughed my butt off!!! Thanks YouTube!!' said one happy customer, while another said paying $5.99 to watch the film was 'totally worth it.' This in contrast to Variety critic Scott Foundas who said in his review of the film that 'North Korea is right to object,' before then going on to warn readers eager to see the film that 'an evening of cinematic waterboarding awaits.' Also expressing their excitement over the comedy's release on social media were stars Seth Rogen and James Franco, who have frequently taken to Twitter, Instagram and Facebook over the past two days to remind everyone how happy they are to see the film released, and, in Rogen's case, suggest that fans check it out on the big screen. 'I need to say that a comedy is best viewed in a theater full of people, so if you can, I'd watch it like that. Or call some friends over,' he said just hours before his surprise appearance Wednesday night. Franco decided to take a much different approach, as the actor continued his current social media strategy of really utilizing his keyboard's caps lock and punctuation keys, writing on Instagram; 'Merry X-mas MERICA!!!!!!THE INTERVIEW IS LIVE!!!!!! !!!Watch it here!!!Thank you SONY!!!!!!!!' There were also a few American flag emojis to really make the post pop. And as an added bonus for Sony, the studio will now go down in the history books for becoming the first studio to release a major motion picture online, as well as being the first studio to simultaneously allow for the viewing of a film across three different platforms - theaters, online and video on demand. 'It has always been Sony's intention to have a national platform on which to release this film,' Sony Pictures chair and CEO Michael Lynton said in a statement. 'We chose the path of digital distribution first so as to reach as many people as possible on opening day, and we continue to seek other partners and platforms to further expand the release.' Even more impressive however is how quickly the studio managed to pull this all together after initially deciding to hold off on distributing the film last week. Sony only announced on Tuesday that the film would play in selected theaters and be released to video on demand on Thursday. As for the big online announcement, that was confirmed less than an hour before the movie appeared on Google Play, YouTube, Microsoft Xbox Video and a Sony website created for the film, with the option of renting the film for $5.99 or downloading it for $16.99. Laughing and laughing: James Franco and Rogen (above in a still from the film) have also be using their social media accounts to share how happy they are to see the film be released . And while many are not doubt eager to learn how many views, and how much dough, Sony will make off of online streaming, the studio has said at this time there is no plan to release the numbers, a move very similar to that practiced by Netflix. Sony also quickly learned the biggest downfall of an online release, as less than an hour after it was released, pirates had already copied and shared the film.","Thousands packed movie theaters across the country last night for the first screening of The Interview, which happened at midnight on Christmas Eve .
This as tens of thousands streamed the film online in just its first day of release .
Early audiences seem to be responding well to the film, sharing how much they enjoyed the comedy on social media .
This news is not doubt a relief to everyone involved in the production and many at the studio after the film was panned by many critics .
Sony also made history on Wednesday when The Interview became to first studio film to have its release online .
They then made history again Thursday, when The Interview became the first film to simultaneously play across three different viewing platforms ."
"A 13-year-old Nigerian girl who was arrested with explosives strapped to her body told journalists that her parents volunteered her to take part in a suicide attack. The girl, who was identified as Zahra'u Babangida, was arrested in Kano on December 10 following a double suicide bombing in a market that killed 10 people. She was presented to journalists on Wednesday by police and instructed to recount how Islamist militants allegedly forced her to take part in the attack. Twisted: A 13-year-old Nigerian girl (pictured) who was arrested with explosives strapped to her body told journalists Wednesday that her parents volunteered her to take part in a suicide attack . Terrifying: This is the bomb belt that the girl was forced to wear - but that she thankfully didn't detonate . She said her mother and father, both Boko Haram sympathisers, took her to an insurgent hideout in a forest near the town of Gidan Zana in Kano state. She said one alleged militant leader asked her whether she knew what a suicide bombing was. Zahra'u told journalists: 'They said, ""Can you do it?"" I said no. 'They said, ""You will go to heaven if you do it."" I said ""no I can't"". They said they would shoot me or throw me into a dungeon.' There was no way to independently verify her story and she had no lawyer present. No information was available concerning the whereabouts of her parents. Police said they had instructed the girl to tell her story to boost public awareness about those responsible for the December 10 attack. Faced with the threat of death, Zahra'u said she finally agreed to take part in the attack but 'never had any intention of doing it'. Several days later, Zahra'u said, she and three other girls, all wearing explosives, were brought to the Kantin Kwari market by unidentified men. Massacre: A man walks past blood stains and rubble after twin suicide blasts at Kantin Kwari textile market in the northern Nigerian city of Kano on December 10 . Zahra'u said she was injured when one of the girls detonated her bomb and then she fled the scene, ending up at a hospital on the outskirts of Kano where she was discovered to be carrying explosives. Boko Haram has increasingly used female suicide bombers, including teenagers, as part of their five-year insurgency. Kano, the largest city in the mainly Muslim north, saw four such attacks in one week in July, while similar bombings have hit the states of Bauchi and Niger. Experts say the group has used girls as bombers to demonstrate the range of tactics they have available to sow fear across Nigeria. If confirmed, Zahra'u's story would be the first known case of parents volunteering their daughter to take part in a deadly attack. Violence in northern Nigeria has intensified in recent months, raising security fears ahead of February 14 elections.","Zahra'u Babangida was taken to a Boko Haram hideout by her parents .

"Click HERE to read Martin Samuel's match report from St Mary's . Morgan Schneiderlin's second-half absence proved to be extremely costly to his side's hopes of maintaining their impressive run as his replacement Maya Yoshida and Victor Wanyama failed to deal with Manchester City's runners. Manchester City's opening goal was fortuitous as Schneiderlin may have been in a better position to block Yaya Toure's shot had he not picked up a knock before the interval. Both Ronald Koeman and his players will be hoping the France international is fit for Southampton's next two fixtures against Arsenal and Manchester United. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Southampton failed to shine after key player Morgan Schneiderlin was substituted due to an injury knock . Schneiderlin was tasked with keeping a close eye on Manchester City's runners such as Jesus Navas . Saints boss Ronald Koeman will be hoping Schneiderlin is back in time to face Arsenal and Manchester United . Saints are clearly at their best when Schneiderlin, who Koeman forced to stay at the club following a mass summer exodus at St Mary's, is dictating play from his side's engine room. Southampton boss Koeman came into his side's Premier League encounter against Manchester City brimming with confidence having led his side to second spot after 12 games. The Dutchman said he had not 'seen one team better than us' throughout his first few months in England but that claim is no longer relevant after Sunday's result. Koeman will be extremely disappointed that his side were beaten by a Toure goal, which was deflected into Fraser Forster's net, and late strikes by Frank Lampard and Gael Clichy. The home side rarely tested Joe Hart but they also managed to keep Manuel Pellegrini's side at bay for the first 75 minutes. Schneiderlin was deployed in a defensive midfield role to screen Southampton's back four. Click HERE to view more of our brilliant Match Zone service . Substitute Maya Yoshida failed to close down Frank Lampard for Manchester City's second goal . Southampton's back line, which was made up of Jose Fonte, Toby Alderweireld, Nathaniel Clyne and Ryan Bertrand, stood firm to minimise the visitors' threat at goal until they went in search of an all-important equaliser. Premier League top scorer Sergio Aguero was denied a stonewall penalty by referee Mike Jones in the first half - but he rarely had a sniff at goal other than in the 84th minute when Southampton were hit on the counter attack. The biggest negative for Southampton was that they lacked creativity to unlock City's shaky defence - even when Eliaquim Mangala was shown a second yellow card in the 74th minute for a reckless challenge on substitute Shane Long. Lampard and Clichy managed to put the game to bed when Southampton were on the lookout for a goal but again Koeman's midfield failed to track City's runners from deep. The Premier League fixture computer has been unkind to Southampton in making the south coast side face Manchester City, Arsenal and Manchester United in quick succession - but it also provides Koeman's side the chance to prove their manager was right in suggesting they can go toe-to-toe with the big boys. Eliaquim Mangala was given his marching orders after picking up two yellow cards against Southampton .","Morgan Schneiderlin was withdrawn at half-time after sustaining thigh injury during first half .

"A father was horrified after his daughters opened a Frozen karaoke machine and discovered a pill inside it. Samuel Wilkes Read gave the toy to daughters Isabella, six, and Lola, four, after his sister-in-law bought it for them in America. The 33-year-old from Cambridge was shocked when they opened the gift to find the small green and purple tablet inside. Lola and Isabella thought the tablet (left) was 'a magic pill' when they found it in their Frozen karaoke machine . Mr Wilkes Read, an airline pilot, said if he hadn't been there to see them open the gift one of the girls would have swallowed the pill and become ill. 'The girls were so excited to open the gift. 'They quickly said there was a magical pill at the bottom stuck in the sellotape and the plastic, it was a green and grey capsule and stood out quite a bit. 'I Googled what it was and it seems to be a diarrhoea tablet, probably the equivalent of Imodium or something similar. 'I assumed it has fallen in as they packed the toy away, no one has spotted it, there is no quality control. 'Because it was a Disney toy they assumed it was part of it and were asking if they could eat it. 'If they could have got at it they would have done but I took it away fairly quickly. It could have made our girls very ill.' The singalong toy was bought by Mr Wilkes Read's sister-in-law. He believes the pill must have fallen in while it was being packaged . Mr Wilkes Read said he was glad he was there when the girls opened the gift as one of them may have swallowed the pill . The Singalong Karaoke was bought by Mr Wilkes Read's sister-in-law Leanne in Target in New York. She quickly snapped it up to bring home for the girls, unaware of what lay inside. As Isabella and Lola quickly ripped into the present morning, desperate to sing along to their favourite Disney movie songs, they found the slightly bashed pill. Using the colouring and markings the girls' father discovered it was a prescription diarrhoea pill, which could seriously harm their daughters . 'I jumped on it pretty quickly and removed it before they could do anything with it,"" the pilot added. 'I can't believe it was in there, it is appalling really. They should really check these things, it could have made my girls really ill if we hadn't have spotted it.'","Samuel Wilkes Read gave the toy to daughters Isabella, six, and Lola, four .

"Queen Elizabeth II used her traditional Christmas broadcast on Thursday to call for reconciliation throughout the United Kingdom and to praise medical workers fighting Ebola in Africa. She said it will take time to heal divisions in Scotland, where a referendum was held this year on whether to remain part of Britain, and praised progress resolving the conflict in Northern Ireland. Elizabeth cited the 'Christmas truce' in 1914 as an example to be remembered. 'Something remarkable did happen that Christmas, exactly 100 years ago today,' she said. 'Without any instruction or command, the shooting stopped and German and British soldiers met in No Man's Land. Photographs were taken and gifts exchanged. It was a Christmas truce.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Queen Elizabeth II and her husband Prince Philip, right, leave after attending the British royal family's traditional Christmas Day church service  in Sandringham, England . She said German forces sang 'Silent Night' so that it could be heard on the British side of the front line. 'That carol is still much-loved today, a legacy of the Christmas truce, and a reminder to us all that even in the unlikeliest of places hope can still be found,' the queen said before wishing everyone a happy Christmas. The queen writes her own Christmas speech, which is pre-recorded and televised in many parts of the world. She made her first Christmas broadcast on radio in 1952. The queen and her close family celebrated Christmas at the sprawling Sandringham estate in Norfolk. Prince William, left, and  Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge arrive to attend the British royal family's traditional Christmas Day church service . Members of Britain's royal family arrive to attend their traditional Christmas Day church service at St. Mary Magdalene Church in Sandringham, England . The royals attended a church service Christmas morning before a gala lunch. Prince William and his pregnant wife Kate were present, but their toddler son, Prince George, didn't go to church. Kate told one person in the crowd she didn't bring one-year-old George because he would have made too much noise. Prince Charles' wife Camilla also didn't attend because of a painful back injury suffered earlier this month, officials said. The queen arrived by car while the other royals walked from her estate to the village church. Prince Harry leaves joined his royal family at St. Mary Magdalene Church in Sandringham, England . Prince William and Kate left baby Prince George at home because he would have been too noisy . The Queen pictured giving her Christmas speech . The Queen's Christmas broadcast is a traditional feature of the festive season where the head of state can express her thoughts about the past year. The Queen made her first Christmas broadcast in 1952 and the annual message was first shown on TV in 1957. In that first broadcast she delivered her message live on the radio from her study at Sandringham in Norfolk. She has delivered one every year except in 1969, when she decided the royals had been on TV enough after an unprecedented family documentary. Instead, her greeting took the form of a written address. In her 1991 message, the Queen silenced rumours of abdication as she pledged to continue to serve. She issued a writ against the Sun newspaper after it published the full text of her 1992 broadcast two days before transmission. She later accepted an apology and a £200,000 donation to charity. The Queen's grandfather, King George V, delivered the first royal Christmas broadcast live on the radio from Sandringham in 1932. George V was at first unsure about using the relatively untried medium of the wireless, but eventually agreed. There was no Christmas broadcast in 1936 or 1938, and it was the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 that firmly established the tradition. The speech is written by the Queen herself and each has a strong religious framework, reflects current issues and often draws on her own experiences. Hundreds of well-wishers lined the route to the church to exchange Christmas greetings with the royals. Some shouted with glee as Prince Harry walked by. One visitor from Spain told reporters she had asked Harry to marry her. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby cancelled his Christmas sermon because of a severe cold. In a statement he expressed 'great regret' about his inability to preach his planned sermon about the true meaning of Christmas. Church officials said the sermon at Canterbury Cathedral would instead be delivered by the Dean of Canterbury Robert Willis. In the ruins of the old Coventry Cathedral is a sculpture of a man and a woman reaching out to embrace each other. The sculptor was inspired by the story of a woman who crossed Europe on foot after the war to find her husband. Casts of the same sculpture can be found in Belfast and Berlin, and it is simply called Reconciliation. Reconciliation is the peaceful end to conflict, and we were reminded of this in August when countries on both sides of the First World War came together to remember in peace. The ceramic poppies at the Tower of London drew millions, and the only possible reaction to seeing them and walking among them was silence. For every poppy a life; and a reminder of the grief of loved ones left behind. No one who fought in that war is still alive, but we remember their sacrifice and indeed the sacrifice of all those in the armed forces who serve and protect us today. In 1914, many people thought the war would be over by Christmas, but sadly by then the trenches were dug and the future shape of the war in Europe was set. But, as we know, something remarkable did happen that Christmas, exactly a hundred years ago today. Without any instruction or command, the shooting stopped and German and British soldiers met in No Man's Land. Photographs were taken and gifts exchanged. It was a Christmas truce. Truces are not a new idea. In the ancient world a truce was declared for the duration of the Olympic Games and wars and battles were put on hold. Sport has a wonderful way of bringing together people and nations, as we saw this year in Glasgow when over 70 countries took part in the Commonwealth Games. It is no accident that they are known as the Friendly Games. As well as promoting dialogue between nations, the Commonwealth Games pioneered the inclusion of para-sports within each day's events. As with the Invictus Games that followed, the courage, determination and talent of the athletes captured our imagination as well as breaking down divisions. The benefits of reconciliation were clear to see when I visited Belfast in June. While my tour of the set of Game Of Thrones may have gained most attention, my visit to the Crumlin Road Gaol will remain vividly in my mind. What was once a prison during the Troubles is now a place of hope and fresh purpose; a reminder of what is possible when people reach out to one another, rather like the couple in the sculpture. Of course, reconciliation takes different forms. In Scotland after the referendum many felt great disappointment, while others felt great relief; and bridging these differences will take time. Bringing reconciliation to war or emergency zones is an even harder task, and I have been deeply touched this year by the selflessness of aid workers and medical volunteers who have gone abroad to help victims of conflict or of diseases like Ebola, often at great personal risk. For me, the life of Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace, whose birth we celebrate today, is an inspiration and an anchor in my life. A role model of reconciliation and forgiveness, he stretched out his hands in love, acceptance and healing. Christ's example has taught me to seek to respect and value all people, of whatever faith or none. Sometimes it seems that reconciliation stands little chance in the face of war and discord. But, as the Christmas truce a century ago reminds us, peace and goodwill have lasting power in the hearts of men and women. On that chilly Christmas Eve in 1914 many of the German forces sang Silent Night, its haunting melody inching across the line. That carol is still much-loved today, a legacy of the Christmas truce, and a reminder to us all that even in the unlikeliest of places hope can still be found. A very happy Christmas to you all.","Monarch remembered the Christmas truce with German troops in 1914 .

"A four-year-old boy with autism from New York who went missing while visiting family in South Carolina has been found dead this morning, authorities say. Coroner Robert Edge told local media outlets that Jayden Morrison was found in a pond in Little River. Emergency workers in Little River on the South Carolina coast searched for the child who went missing on Christmas Eve and was last seen wearing red footie pajamas. Area media outlets report rescue workers and volunteers searched until 1 a.m. on Christmas Day for Jayden Morrison. He was last seen at his grandmother's house about 6 p.m. on Wednesday. Missing: Jayden Morrison, 4, went missing from his grandmother's home in South Carolina last night . An Horry County Police dispatcher says the search resumed about 7 a.m. Thursday. The child's mother, Tabatha Morrison, tells reporters the family arrived at her mother's house on Christmas Eve day just hours earlier from New York. She says her son is autistic and wouldn't respond if his name was called. Before he was found dead, Jayden's mother said he likely would not be able to find his way home because he is not familiar with his grandmother's neighborhood. 'He’s never done anything like this before,' Morrison told the Sun News. 'He’s 4 years old. He’s never been out of my eyesight.'

"Stoke City players were incensed when referee Michael Oliver denied them what appeared to be a stonewall penalty against Manchester United, despite having a clear view of the incident. As Potters striker Peter Crouch headed the ball on, Chris Smalling could be seen lifting his arm as the ball struck him on the way through. Referee Oliver was in a good position to see the incident clearly, but made the decision to refrain from awarding a spot kick. The ball clearly hits the arm of Manchester United defender Chris Smalling on the way through . A different angle of the incident shows again that the ball hits Smalling after Peter Crouch's header . Referee Michael Oliver (bottom left) has an unobstructed view of the incident between Stoke and United . After the match, speaking to Sky Sports, Crouch said of the incident: 'It was a yard ahead of me, my header was on target. Smalling had his hands up and for me, it was a definite penalty.' Stoke manager Mark Hughes added: ‘Chris Smalling has lost Peter Crouch on the initial header and is just trying to get something in the way of the ball. It’s a goal-bound header and he’s made an intentional movement with his arm to bat the ball down. ‘The referee is clearly standing there four or five yards away so why he hasn’t given it I don’t know. ‘It’s a waste of time (speaking to Oliver about it). I’m sure he will say something like the lad couldn’t get out of the way because he was so close but I don’t think that’s the case.' At the time of the incident, Stoke were level with Manchester United, who equalised through Radamel Falcao. The home side had gone 1-0 up after just two minutes, and were looking to hold on for an invaluable point against Louis van Gaal's men. They managed to keep the scores level at 1-1, leaving them in 10th place ahead of the 3pm kick-offs in the Premier League. Manchester United remain third. It was a quiet game for Michael Oliver. The only real talking point was the penalty for the Chris Smalling handball. His arms were up in an unnatural position, so it should have been a penalty. Manchester United have certainly had a lucky Christmas in terms of penalties awarded against them, with the Stoke incident the clearest of three. United had one given against them versus Newcastle on Boxing Day, but there should have been another earlier in the game at Old Trafford, when Juan Mata tripped Yoan Gouffran. At White Hart Lane two days later, Wayne Rooney clearly held Harry Kane toward the end of the game as a corner was taken, but appeals were waved away. Louis van Gaal's side are riding their luck.

The war hero's appearance comes just days before American and NATO combat troops will withdraw from Afghanistan after 13 years in the country.

"A somber Pope Francis steeped his Christmas message to the world in sadness for those with little cause for joy — abused children, refugees, hostages and others suffering from violence in the Middle East, Africa, Ukraine and elsewhere. 'Truly there are so many tears this Christmas, said Francis, looking solemn and smiling little, to a crowd, estimated by the Vatican to number more than 80,000 Romans, tourists and pilgrims, filled St. Peter's Square for his 'Urbi et Orbi' message (Latin for 'to the city and to the world').

Anguish for children who suffer maltreatment or violence, including in the recent terrorist attack on a Pakistani military school, tempered the pontiff's traditional Christmas Day speech . 'I think also of those infants massacred in bomb attacks, also those where the Son of God was born,' he said, referring to the Middle East . Pope Francis condemned 'brutal' religious persecution in the Middle East while urging peace in Nigeria, Ukraine and other troubled spots . He lamented that many children are 'made objects of trade and trafficking' or forced to become soldiers, as well as those never born because of abortion. 'I think also of those infants massacred in bomb attacks, also those where the Son of God was born,' he said, referring to the Middle East. The Pope also decried the persecution of ancient Christian communities in Iraq and Syria, along with those from other ethnic and religious groups. 'May Christmas bring them hope,' he said. Referring to refugees and exiles, he prayed: 'May indifference be changed into closeness, and rejection into hospitality.' He expressed hope they'd receive humanitarian help to withstand the 'rigors of winter, return to their countries and live with dignity.' The pope also thanked those courageously helping people infected with Ebola in Africa. In his litany of the world's troubled places, he denounced hostage-taking in Nigeria, and hoped that reconciliation would prevail over 'hatred and violence' in Ukraine, where pro-Russian rebels have been fighting against government forces in the east of that country. While much of his message concerned poor countries, Francis had harsh words for some in affluent nations. He prayed for an end to the hardened hearts 'of so many men and women immersed in worldliness and indifference, the globalization of indifference.' 'Truly there are so many tears this Christmas,' said Francis, looking solemn and smiling little, in contrast to his often jocular demeanor when addressing crowds . He lamented that many children are 'made objects of trade and trafficking' or forced to become soldiers, as well as those never born because of abortion .

'I think also of those infants massacred in bomb attacks, also those where the Son of God was born,' he said, referring to the Middle East . Christmas joy will only be realized when weapons are transformed 'into ploughshares, destruction into creativity, hatred into love and tenderness,' Francis concluded before giving the crowd his blessing. Pope Francis celebrated Christmas Eve with a late-night Mass in St Peter's Basilica after making a phone call to refugees in Iraq who have been forced to flee their homes by ISIS. In the phone call, the Pontiff told refugees at the tent camp in Ankawa, northern Iraq, that they too were like Jesus and were forced to flee because there was no place for them. His call of Christmas greetings came as the Vatican prepared to host the Mass, with the Pope already unveiling a statue of the baby Jesus in a nativity scene.

The Ankawa camp houses mostly Christian refugees forced to flee the onslaught by militants of ISIS. In a letter to Middle East Christians penned earlier this week, Francis urged them to remain in the region, where Christian communities have existed for 2,000 years, and to help their fellow Muslim citizens present 'a more authentic image of Islam' as a religion of peace. Pope Francis has written a Christmas letter to Christians in the Middle East to express his closeness to them at a time of 'afflictions and tribulations' Pope Francis holds a cross in the late night service in St Peter's Basilica, which marks the start of a busy festive period for the 78-year-old . The Mass came just days after Francis excoriated the Vatican bureaucracy for a laundry list of sins, including lusting for power and suffering from 'spiritual Alzheimer's' During the Mass hours later in St Peter's, Francis echoed some of the themes he raised in the phone call as he reflected on the Nativity scene. 'How much the world needs tenderness today!' he said. 'God's patience, God's closeness, God's tenderness.' In his homily, the Pope, wearing white vestments, said Christmas is a time to remember that God's message of peace 'is stronger than darkness and corruption'. He said: 'The question put to us simply by the infant's presence is, 'Do I allow God to love me?' Do we have the courage to welcome with tenderness the difficulties and problems of those who are near to us?' It is the second Christmas season for Pope Francis as leader of the Roman Catholic Church and being elected last year. The Mass marked the start of a busy few weeks for the 78-year-old that includes New Year's Eve vespers and 2015 greetings a few hours later. On January 6 he will celebrate Epiphany Mass, and on January 11 he will baptise babies in the Sistine Chapel.

Several have spoken out in recent days saying Francis was merely asking them to examine their consciences, as any Jesuit spiritual director would do, and to use the Christmas season to heal. Meanwhile, thousands of pilgrims also flocked to Bethlehem to travel to the Church of the Nativity for traditional Christmas Eve celebrations. On a crisp sunny day, revellers crowded into Manger Square, stopping in restaurants and admiring the Christmas tree in the town, where Jesus is believed to have been born. Scout troops could be heard playing bagpipes, horns and drums, while street traders sold Santa hats and special sesame sweets for children. The celebrations brought a boost to the area after a difficult year, which saw Israel battle Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip during a 50-day war over the summer. The Church of the Nativity, built over the grotto that Christians believe is the site of Jesus' birth, was flanked by a towering Christmas tree and a large poster in Arabic and English that read 'All I want for Christmas is justice.'","Pope Francis delivered Christmas Day speech to more than 80,000 from balcony overlooking St Peter's Square .

"The world's longest coma patient, a Miami woman who had been called the 'Sleeping Snow White' during the 42 years she remained comatose, has died at the age of 59. Edwarda O'Bara was a cheery high school student in 1970 when she suddenly fell ill, threw up her medicine and slipped into a diabetic coma. But before she became comatose she turned to her mother and pleaded with her to 'promise ... you won't leave me.' Her mother stayed true to her word, enduring a grueling schedule to constantly stay near her daughter until the mother died five years ago and the woman's sister became her primary care giver - until Edwarda passed away on Wednesday. Sisters: Colleen O'Bara leans over her sister, Edwarda in April. Colleen cared for her sister full time after their mother passed away in 2008 . As a popular 16-year-old, Edwarda had a bright future ahead of her but then she became ill with a severe bout of pneumonia. In the early hours of January 3 in 1970, she 'woke up shaking and in great pain because the oral form of insulin she had been taking wasn't reaching her blood stream,' according to her family. She was rushed to hospital and as she lay in her bed, she turned to her mother, Kaye O'Bara, and pleaded with her to stay near. 'Promise me you won't leave me,' the teen begged her mother, according to the Miami Herald. Terrified, O'Bara assured daughter, 'Of course not. I would never leave you, darling,' having no idea of the long ordeal ahead. The mother kept that promise, taking care of her daughter, until Kaye O'Bara herself died five years ago. Tragic: Edwarda (pictured as a 14-year-old girl) suddenly fell ill in 1970 and has been in a coma ever since . For more than 35 years, Kaye O'Bara remained constantly by Edwarda's bedside, enduring a grueling schedule to give her daughter around the clock care. She would only sleep for 90 minutes at a time, so she would always be accessible to her daughter. The devoted mother would not . institutionalize Edwarda, even though the financial burden became a . great challenge to the family. ""Promise... you won't leave me,"" the teen begged her mother. ""Of course not. I would never leave you, darling,"" her mother replied. Though Kaye died at the age of 80 on . March 7, 2008, she never gave up hope that her daughter would one day . wake up from her coma. Edwarda's father, Joe, had passed away in 1977. He died from a heart attack, believed to have been brought on by the strain of caring for his ailing daughter. After . their mother's passing, Edwarda's sister Colleen stepped in and . continued the tradition to offer constant care to Edwarda at her home in . Miami Gardens. Colleen quit her previous job as a horse trainer to care full time for her sister. 'I didn’t give it a second thought. She's my sister,' Colleen O'Bara said, 'and I love her.' Bright future: Edwarda O'Bara (pictured left in a childhood photo with her mother Kay, center, and sister, Colleen, front right) was a popular 16-year-old girl before she fell ill with pneumonia in 1970 . Illness: Edwarda, pictured in a childhood photo from 1957, suffered from childhood diabetes . As part of her care, her body was turned every two hours to keep away bedsores, she was given insulin and fed through a tube. Colleen would also lovingly braid her sister's grey hairs, suck the mucus from Edwarda's throat to allow her to breath and constantly speak to her sister, assuming Edwarda was soaking up her every word. She mixes baby food, milk, eggs, orange juice, Mazola oil, brewer's yeast and . a piece of white bread into a blender and then a wire mesh strainer, pouring . the concoction into Edwarda's feeding tube every two hours, day and night. She suctions mucus from Edwarda's throat, whispers endearments in her ear and . braids her long gray hair. Family and friends would also visit her, playing music and reading to the woman. Kaye O'Bara was a devout Catholic who said she felt the presence of the Virgin Mary in her daughter's room. That led Dr. Wayne Dyer to write a book about the family and their unconditional care for Edwarda, 'A Promise Is A Promise: An Almost Unbelievable Story of a Mother’s Unconditional Love and What It Can Teach Us.' The book . attracted widespread attention and visitors from around the world would . come and visit the ailing woman and encourage her family. 'I had to learn to let strangers in,' Colleen O'Bara said, 'because they aren't strangers.' A promise is a promise: Edwarda asked her mother, Kaye O'Bara (pictured in an undated photo), to never leave her side. The mother was presented with a medal from the Catholic Church, the highest honor a layperson can receive, for her diligent care . Always by her side: Then 77-year-old Kaye O'Bara (pictured in May 2005) was a constant companion to her daughter Edwarda O'Bara, then 52 . Remembering Edwarda as 'the best sister in the whole wide world,' Colleen said that she learned so much from the experience. 'She taught me so much, and I’m talking about now, after she was in the coma,' Colleen O'Bara said. 'She . taught me so much about unconditional love that I couldn't say I had it . before. She taught me about patience, that I didn’t have before. I . learned so much from taking care of my sister. It’s like I grew up . overnight.' ""She . taught me so much about unconditional love... she taught me about patience. I . learned so much from taking care of my sister. It's like I grew up . overnight."" This April, Colleen gathered friends and family to Miami to celebrate Edwarda's 59th birthday. 'We all had a . good time at the party especially Edwarda. Everyone was so amazed at how . aware of everything going on she was. It was just a good day,' the . sister shared with her friends and supporters on Facebook. 'My mom's spirit was so strong that we all felt her with us,' Colleen added. Throughout the year, Colleen had updated supporters on Facebook on her sister's condition. Celebration: Colleen O'Bara (front right) invited friends and family to celebrate her sister's 59th birthday at a party this April . Birthday: The family held onto hope even after the 42 years that Edwarda was in a coma (pictured: a balloon at Edward's birthday party in April) 'She is still making different sounds and is so much more aware of her surroundings,' the sister wrote in a posting in October. 'When I am talking to her I have her total attention, I can tell by the look in her eyes. This just really makes me smile.' 'Thank you for all the cards and letters I received They always make me smile,' she added, expressing gratitude. Even though Colleen was optimistic about her sister's improvement, she noticed that on Tuesday night, Edwards was having difficulty keeping her food down. By Wednesday, the woman seemed to be feeling better and her sister told Edwarda that she was going to grab a cup of coffee. 'I noticed her looking directly at me and gave me the biggest smile I had ever seen,' her sister said. When Colleen returned with her coffee, Edwarda had already passed away. 'She then closed her eyes and joined my Mom in Heaven,' Colleen announced. Edwarda is survived by her sister, nephew Richard O'Bara and great-nephew Joseph Michael O'Bara. A person is deemed to be comatose, or in a coma, when they are unconscious for more than six hours. While . comatose, a patient cannot be woken up and though they sometimes appear . to be awake, they cannot consciously feel, speak, hear, or move. Around . 40 per cent of comas are drug induced while others are caused by a lack . of oxygen reaching the brain (25 per cent) or strokes (20 per cent).

"Click here to read Laurie Whitwell's match report from the Britannia . It was May 2012 when Stewart Downing last pulled on an England shirt, but his renaissance at West Ham this season gives credible cause to believe he can once again be part of Roy Hodgson’s plans. West Ham boss Sam Allardyce insisted his player is in the thoughts of the England manager and deserved to receive a call-up for this month’s internationals due to his versatility and ability. Downing scored and assisted after moving from the wing to a central role as West Ham clawed back a point on Saturday having trailed 2-0. He delivered a superb deep cross for Enner Valencia to head in, then struck a late equaliser with a firm right-foot shot. Stewart Downing celebrates with his team-mates after scoring West Ham's second goal at the weekend . Downing has not played for England since 2012, but there have been calls for him to return to the squad . At 30, he has been a key reason for West Ham recording their best start to a campaign since 2000, creating 30 chances for team-mates. Only Chelsea’s Cesc Fabregas (35) and Southampton’s Dusan Tadic (31) can post better numbers in this department. England play Slovenia in a Euro 2016 qualifier on November 15 before welcoming Scotland to Wembley in a friendly three days later. Hodgson watched Downing in the victory over champions Manchester City just over a week ago. ‘If he picks me it would be unbelievable, I’d love to play for England,’ said Downing. ‘The main thing for me is that I’ve got to keep playing well and if I can nick goals and create, it gives him a problem to think about. Downing has seen a real resurgence in form this season, pictured battling with Erik Pieters on Saturday . Sam Allardyce has backed his player to return to the England squad after his impressive form . ‘We’ll see what happens. I know he’s been to games and is watching us. If he picks me, great. If not, I’ll just carry on.’ Allardyce added: ‘If they need a central midfield player either in the three or in the hole, it’s well worth having a look at him the way he’s played this year. He’s not under the radar for England. Roy will have everybody on the radar, believe you me. ‘They have already recognised that Stewart has taken a different position. ‘Whether that fits into his shape of play that’s up to Roy to decide, but certainly Stewart is making big strides to say, “Here I am, I’m playing really, really well”.’ Stoke manager Mark Hughes plans to speak to PGMOL, the body that governs referees, after Alex Song escaped a red card despite a two-foot lunge at Mame Biram Diouf. Downing was all smiles as he celebrated with Kevin Nolan after equalising for West Ham against Stoke . Arms aloft, Downing runs in celebration at the Britannia Stadium on Saturday afternoon . Hughes was incensed as West Ham scored their first goal 22 seconds after the incident with referee Chris Foy failing to even see a foul. ‘We’ll ask about it because it’s a poor decision,’ said Hughes. ‘We are not trying to get people into trouble. We’d just like observations about that. Our view is that the game should have been stopped.’ This display was arguably Stoke’s best performance of the campaign so far, with Diouf, Bojan, Victor Moses and Jon Walters a menace throughout. Moses opened the scoring — and his Stoke City account — with a scrambled finish from close range, and Diouf doubled the lead with a header from Walters’s cross. Hughes paid tribute to Bojan, who showed his potential after a difficult start to his time in England. ‘He’s sat out games and he’s watched and learned. You saw today that he’s going to be a good player for us.’","Stewart Downing last played for England in May 2012 .

"England manager Roy Hodgson has not spoken to Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers about the fitness of striker Daniel Sturridge ahead of his squad announcement for the matches against Slovenia and Scotland. England play Slovenia in a European Championship qualifier on November 15 before facing Scotland in a friendly match three days later. Reds forward Sturridge, who has been sidelined since early September with a thigh injury suffered on England duty and a calf problem before his club comeback, has travelled to Spain with Liverpool for their Champions League clash with Real Madrid. Liverpool ace Daniel Sturridge has been out of action since picking up a thigh injury . Roy Hodgson plans to hold talks with Brendan Rodgers over the possibility of calling up Sturridge . The 25-year-old is not expected to play and Three Lions boss Hodgson revealed he still has to check with Rodgers about the striker's fitness before including him in the squad. When asked if he had spoken to Rodgers, Hodgson told Sky Sports News: 'No not at the moment but I have it in mind to do so of course. 'I was waiting to see what the situation would be with him (Sturridge). It's very good news to hear that he's travelled but of course before I select him again I would check with the player and the club that we were doing the right thing.' While Sturridge's fitness still has a question mark over it, Arsenal welcomed back fellow England star Theo Walcott after a long-term injury. The England boss could also call up Arsenal winger Theo Walcott following his return from injury . Walcott missed the 2014 World Cup after being ruled out for nine months with a knee injury . Walcott missed out on the World Cup in Brazil after suffering a cruciate knee injury in January but came off the bench to play a cameo role in the Gunners' 3-0 win over Burnley at the weekend. Hodgson was playing his cards close to his chest ahead of the squad announcement, but admitted that any English player who is fit could come into the reckoning. 'All players who are English and who have any ability are in my thoughts,' Hodgson said. 'It's very rare that there would be an English player who's got any ability and is available to play for England and hasn't retired are in our thoughts. 'Arsene [Wenger] has never been a problem in that regard and neither have the other managers for that matter. 'I've been very fortunate in that normally when players are fit and able to come with the national team, the managers are very good at allowing them or accepting that they are going to come without any complaint. 'It's nice of course when a manager like Arsene goes out and has a player that's been out for a long, long time and says that if we want to select him we can.'","Roy Hodgson is contemplating whether to call up Daniel Sturridge .

"Four years of bloody conflict has ravaged their homes and families, leaving any memories of peace  shrouded in helpless grief. For Syria's thousands of refugees seeking relief from the destructive war, Christmas Day is one of hundreds spent in fear for their lives.

"A suburban Denver man charged with pushing his wife to her death off a cliff in Colorado's Rocky Mountain National Park could not explain to investigators why he had a park map with an 'X'' drawn at the spot where she fell. Newly unsealed court documents say Harold Henthorn denied using the map during the deadly September 29, 2012, hike. But he told friends that he scouted out the park's steep and craggy terrain at least six times, trying to find the perfect place to take Toni to celebrate their 12th year of marriage. Accused: Harold Henthorn, left, has been accused of murdering his wife, Dr Toni Henthorn, right, who fell to her death while the couple took a hike at Rocky Mountain National Park in September 2012 . In more than 20 search warrants made public Wednesday, authorities say Henthorn studied his wife's financial status before marrying her, gave conflicting stories about what he was doing when she fell and may have tried to kill her previously. Henthorn, 58, was indicted last week on a first-degree murder charge in the death of Toni, 50, a wealthy ophthalmologist from Mississippi. Prosecutors say she fell more than 140 feet off a cliff in a remote area far from the trail the couple had been hiking. Henthorn's attorney, Craig L. Truman, declined to comment Wednesday. Henthorn told authorities his wife was trying to take a photo of one of the park's majestic views when she slipped, according to the search warrants. Family: Dr Henthorn, a skilled ophthalmologist, left behind a seven-year-old daughter when she died in 2012 . The documents describe Henthorn as a controlling and obsessive husband who stood to benefit from his late wife's three life insurance policies totaling $4.5 million. Prosecutors at a hearing last week said they also believe Henthorn killed his first wife 17 years earlier, though he has not been charged in that case. Sandra Lynn Henthorn, who died in May 1995, was crushed to death when a car slipped off a jack while she and her husband were changing a flat tire. Henthorn received nearly $500,000 from her life insurance policies. In both of his wives' deaths, investigators said, Henthorn was the lone witness. He was also the only witness when a 20-foot beam fell on Toni Henthorn and almost killed her while the couple was working at their mountain cabin, according to the documents. Henthorn called for his wife to come outside. Toni Henthorn went outside and bent over to look at something on the ground, then was struck by the beam, her mother told investigators. Mystery: Harold Henthorn told authorities his wife slipped on a steep mountainside while taking a photo . She told her mother that if she had not bent over, the beam would have killed her. Relatives and friends told investigators there were other times that they were concerned about the Henthorns' relationship. Loss: His first wife, Sandra Lynn, was killed when their car crushed her as she changed a flat tire . They said Henthorn controlled his wife's phone calls and limited her contact with their daughter, now 9. A baby sitter wondered if Henthorn was having an affair because he claimed to travel for work so much, the documents show. He told friends he made money as a fundraiser for churches and nonprofits, but investigators found no proof that he was steadily employed. But they did find he owned a life insurance policy on his former sister-in-law for $400,000. Investigators found the woman and Henthorn had called each other more than 130 times in 2012. After Toni Henthorn's death, he gave her brothers conflicting information about what he was doing when she fell. One brother told investigators that Henthorn recalled getting a text message about his daughter's soccer match when he 'saw a blur, looked up and Toni was gone.' He later said he was looking for a text message about his daughter getting to the babysitter's house. Investigators found time stamps on the texts didn't match the timeline Henthorn gave them. Those close to Henthorn at the funeral said he seemed more distraught over the knowledge that he was under investigation than he did over his wife's death, the documents say. He told one relative that a park ranger had a vendetta against him and had accused him of taking the $12,000 ring off Toni's finger after she had fallen. If there was an indictment, he said, law enforcement can 'come in my house and cabin, and dig for girlfriends in my backyard.'

"Marybeth Rataic who is accused of having sex with her friend's 10-year-old son while babysitting him and his siblings . A babysitter has been accused of repeatedly having sex with her friend's 10-year-old son while she was looking after him and his other siblings. Marybeth Rataic is facing 10 felony charges after allegedly having sex three times with the boy at his home in Meriden, Connecticut. Police say that in one instance, the 25-year-old from Willimantic, had sex with the boy while his siblings slept in the room after creeping into the child's room, which he shared with his brothers. She is also accused of having sex with the 10-year-old while his mother was giving birth in hospital. Another encounter is also said to have taken place after Rataic went to buy drugs, her arrest warrant says. According to NBC Connecticut, suspicions arose when the boy's mother noticed he had a love bite on his neck. He then told her that that he had sex with Rataic at least three times between August 19 and 23. Rataic, herself a mother to a nine-month-old baby, denies the allegations that she sexually abused the boy saying that he forced himself upon her. It is reported that she said she tried to stop the child by pushing him away. The Record Journal reports that she didn't tell anybody about the incident because she was too 'embarrassed'. Ashley Elliot, who lives in the same apartment building as Rataic and is friends with her told NBC she is still concerned about the child even after everything that went on. Rataic was arraigned at Meriden Superior Court, pictured, and is facing 10 felony charges . She added: 'Emotionally, she's torn apart.' Rataic was arraigned at Meriden Superior Court after being charged with three counts of first-degree sexual assault and seven counts of risk of injury to a minor/impairing the morals of children. She is now being held on a $150,000 bond is due to appear at New Haven Superior Court later this month.","Marybeth Rataic, 25, is accused of having sex with the 10-year-old boy .

"Jurgen Klinsmann wants the chance to prove the accelerated development of football in the United States with a date against England at Wembley. The Americans have played at Wembley twice, losing 2-0 in both games, in 1994 and 2008, but Klinsmann has helped the nation fall in love with the sport and his team’s impressive World Cup performance has fuelled the interest. He brings his team to London next week for a friendly against Colombia, at Craven Cottage, when he hopes to further enhance this burgeoning reputation with English fans. Jurgen Klinsmann has been USA team coach since 2011, and has massively improved the national side . ‘A lot of people in England notice we are coming along,’ said Klinsmann. ‘They were full of compliments after the World Cup performance even though they were sad about their own team not going through to the knock-out stages. ‘The respect is growing on a global stage for the USA. They notice we can develop players and we can put good teams together. They notice the MLS is growing very fast and getting stronger and they see the national team taking the game to opponents as we will with Colombia. We want to beat them. It will be difficult but possible. ‘They see our results when we travel. They know it’s a nation that really takes sport seriously. That’s what people see in the UK. They give us respect. Hopefully we can get an opportunity soon to play against England at Wembley Stadium and prove it.’ USA made it to the knock-out stages of the World Cup in Brazil but were beaten by Belgium . The former Tottenham striker is excited about a return to London. ‘The city is just amazing, one of the most beautiful in the world, and soccer-driven,’ said the German coach, who led the United States into the last 16 of the World Cup, where they were beaten by Belgium in a tight game. ‘Getting out of the Group of Death was huge, and I still think we could have done better against Belgium,’ said Klinsmann, but he is demanding more consistency from some players he believes have suffered from a dip in form since their heroics in Brazil. ‘That’s something to improve. Our players have to become stronger to deal with the big moments and then go back into their clubs and play at the same standards. It takes professionalism to come out of a World Cup. Klinsmann said he wants to prove how good his side are at Wembley against England . ‘Look at the best in the world – Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Thomas Muller – they come out of a World Cup, go through their preparation and show the same level as they did before. This is a lesson for us to learn. We can’t drop 30 or 40 per cent.’ The USA will also play in Dublin against the Republic of Ireland and Klinsmann paid tribute to Robbie Keane and the contribution he has made to the MLS since leaving Spurs for LA Galaxy in 2011. ‘Robbie is Ireland’s biggest ambassador in the MLS,’ said Klinsmann. ‘He is a special player. He always gives everything. His nature is never about how much money he can make. He still plays for the national team and flies back and forth. It is total dedication. Having a role model like him in this league is huge.’ Klinsmann, who played in London with Tottenham, said the city was 'beautiful', 'amazing' and 'soccer-driven' Jurgen Kilnsmann's USA are taking on Colombia at Craven Cottage on November 14, you can buy tickets here.","USA are coming to London to play Colombia at Craven Cottage .

"Vets believe a black seal pup beaten up, bullied and abandoned by its family and other seals was a victim of racist attacks. The two-week-old pup had an ulcerated eye and a variety of scar wounds believed to have been inflicted by other seals that were wary of his different appearance. The rare-coloured seal was found on the Scilly Isles and is now recuperating at the Cornish Seal Sanctuary. Named Badger, the black-coloured pup is extremely rare for seal populations in the south of England . The pup was named  'Badger' because he is coloured similarly to a U.S. comic book super hero named The Badger. The jet black pup appeared traumatised by his experiences in the wild. Tamara Cooper, the sanctuary's animal care team supervisor, said: 'When he arrived he had an infection and was struggling to feed himself. 'He was very shaken up and we had to put him on a course of antibiotics and ensure that we gave him lots of TLC. 'Soon the pup started to recover and we discovered that he was a lovely animal. 'We chose the theme of superheroes for the names of all our rescued pups this winter and Badger just seemed the perfect choice for our all-black newcomer.' Black seal pups are a rare occurrence with the majority of seal pups being a shade of white or light grey. Badger pictured during his recovery at the Cornish Seal Sanctuary. Prior to moulting, his fur was a shade of brown . Tamara added: 'When he moulted his infant coat the coat beneath was inky black. 'Black pups are very rare in the south of England and are more usually found among the Scottish population. 'We haven't had a black pup in our care since 2007 so we love being able to have this opportunity to care for him.' Badger is still under close supervision but has now been moved from the intensive care section into the nursery pools. The youngster is now able to feed himself and if all goes well should be ready to resume life in the wild by early March next year.","Vets believe a  seal pup was attacked by other seals because of its colour .

"'Tis the season to be a Chelsea supporter. Three points ahead of Manchester City by December 25, and just about every record is backing you to claim a fourth Barclays Premier League title: . Chelsea's Cesc Fabregas shoots to score his team's second goal against Stoke City on Monday night . Fabregas slides in celebration as Chelsea moved top of the Premier League by three points on Monday night . Eden Hazard celebrates the win as he and Fabregas caused havoc against Stoke on Monday night . History is on their side but records are there to be broken, as the cliché goes. When Chelsea were top by December 25 in 2004, they were five points clear. In 2005, nine. In 2009, four. Their three now is as fine a margin they've cut. Those royal blue eyes blinked once against Newcastle United, they could do so again. But first, the numbers that divide them: Chelsea’s 42 points to City’s 39. Chelsea’s +25 goal difference to their +22. The latter acting as Mourinho's  cushion, for now. Then to the obscure categories: chances created, dribbles attempted, distance covered, tackles, passes, and saves, among others. These we now have since Opta was born 11 years ago. They unearth the kind of gems us statistical geeks crave. Cesc Fabregas, for example, has more assists in 16 Premier League games for Chelsea than Jack Wilshere has in his entire Arsenal career. That’s 12 assists in 16 to Wilshere’s 11 in 95. The Spaniard is eight shy of the record (20), too, first set by his old pal Thierry Henry between 2002 and 2003. 54 - Fabregas, Chelsea . 52 - Downing, West Ham . 47 - Tadic, Southampton . 44 - Sanchez, Arsenal . 43 - Sterling, Liverpool . 43 - Hazard, Chelsea . 42 - Eriksen, Tottenham . 41 - Sigurdsson, Swansea . 36 - Baines, Everton . 35 - Gerrard, Liverpool . 134 - Hazard, Chelsea . 131 - Bolasie, Crystal Palace . 113 - Sterling, Liverpool . 99 - Montero, Swansea . 98 - Sanchez, Arsenal . 93 - Oxlade-Chamberlain, Arsenal . 85 - Lamela, Tottenham . 85 - Sissoko, Newcastle . 75 - Aguero, Manchester City . 72 - Mahrez, Leicester .

Fabregas's heat map against Stoke (left) and Hazard's heat map against Stoke (right) as Chelsea won 2-0 . Arsene Wenger may not admit it, but he missed a trick in June. It is Fabregas who, having gone unwanted by the Frenchman, has created the most chances in the Premier League since leaving Barcelona (54). 'Cesc is Blue,' so the unfurled banners at Stamford Bridge say, and he is followed by West Ham's Stewart Downing (52), Southampton's Dusan Tadic (47), then Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez (44). Liverpool's Raheem Sterling and Chelsea's Eden Hazard are among them, too (43). The latter is proving every bit the Ballon d'Or nominee he is. Hazard has attempted the most dribbles in the Premier League (134), his latest resulting in a kicking from Phil Bardsley (pictured below). Well, that's one way to stop him. Sanchez, again, represents Arsenal (98). It epitomises that unfortunate oh, so Arsenal way. There or thereabouts; always the bridesmaid, never the bride. Stoke's Phil Bardsley committed this crunch tackle on Hazard on Monday night to stop the Chelsea winger . 195.5 - Livermore, Hull . 193.6 - Ki, Swansea . 190.7 - N'Zonzi, Stoke . 188.9 - Fabregas, Chelsea . 186.4 - Matic, Chelsea . 186.3 - Colback, Newcastle . 185.5 - Eriksen, Tottenham . 184.5 - Janmaat, Newcastle . 180.3 - Sigurdsson, Swansea . 179.0 - Cresswell, West Ham . Speed and distance data courtesy of the EA SPORTS Player Performance Index, Official Player Rating Index of the Premier League . To the workhorses. It is Hull City's Jake Livermore that has covered the most distance in the Premier League (195.5km). His £8million club-record fee to Tottenham Hotspur being paid off in sweat at the KC Stadium apparently. Next up, Swansea's Ki Sung-yueng (193.6) and Stoke's Steven N'Zonzi (190.7). Then, Chelsea. Fabregas (188.9) and Nemanja Matic (186.4) hog two of the top five distances covered in the Premier League. The spine of champions? It would appear so. Neither Liverpool or Arsenal, nor either Manchester club, feature (right). Tackles, too. Aside from  Southampton right-back Nathaniel Clyne (73), showing why he is wanted by Manchester United and Liverpool, Matic is tied with Crystal Palace captain Mile Jedinak (62). 73 - Clyne, Southampton . 62 - Jedinak, Crystal Palace . 62 - Matic, Chelsea . 54 - Kelly, Crystal Palace . 54 - Livermore, Hull . 52 - Gardner, West Brom . 51 - Wanyama, Southampton . 51 - Boyd, Burnley . 49 - Janmaat, Newcastle . 48 - De Laet, Leicester . In Matic they are the only club of the Premier League's chasing pack represented. A moment that summed up the defensive midfielder came against Stoke. Geoff Cameron, angling for a route to the box, was met by a lunging, stretching, perfectly-timed tackle by a 6ft 4in Serb. Denied, cleanly. Chelsea made 37 tackles on a not-so cold and windy Monday night at the Britannia, their most in a Premier League match this year, and you’ll be hard pressed to find one better. Matic gave as good as he got against a physical Stoke, shown by his tussles with N'Zonzi (below), and let's not forget, either, Chelsea lost the one match he was absent in Newcastle. It was down the A19 from St James' Park at Middlesbrough where Matic had a trial in January 2009. These days he is an essential cog in the Mourinho machine. Nemanja Matic  gave as good as he got against a physical Stoke, shown as he tussles with Steven N'Zonzi . Matic and N'Zonzi get physical during the Monday night match between Stoke and Chelsea at the Britannia . And so to better reading for Manuel Pellegrini. In Yaya Toure the Manchester City manager has an orchestrator, the most successful and prolific passer in the Premier League. An unsure start is, slowly but surely, unravelling. Toure (1,285) and Fabregas (1,205), both Barcelona alumni of sorts but never team-mates, have pulled away from their nearest competitors. Those being Everton’s Phil Jagielka (943) and, you guessed it, Matic (940). Yet narrow it to the final attacking third and, again, it's a Chelsea thing. Hazard (540) and Fabregas (535) beat Toure (459). Then, Arsenal; Santi Cazorla (445) and Sanchez (424), before an honourable mention for Tottenham’s Christian Eriksen (383). Yaya Toure is currently the most successful and prolific passer in the Premier League with 1,285 to his name . 1285 - Toure, Manchester City . 1205 - Fabregas, Chelsea . 943 - Jagielka, Everton . 940 - Matic, Chelsea . 912 - Barry, Everton . 867 - Ki, Swansea . 855 - Fonte, Southampton . 836 - N'Zonzi, Stoke . 828 - Gerrard, Liverpool . 798 - Williams, Swansea . 540 - Hazard, Chelsea . 535 - Fabregas, Chelsea . 459 - Toure, Manchester City . 445 - Cazorla, Arsenal . 424 - Sanchez, Arsenal . 383 - Eriksen, Tottenham . 350 - Ramsey, Arsenal . 349 - Silva, Manchester City . 347 - Oscar, Chelsea . 338 - Nasri, Manchester City . Hazard has made the most passes in the final third of the pitch in the Premier League with 540 so far . Toure (1,285) and Fabregas (1,205) both lead the way for successful passes in the Premier League . A strange thing, these statistics. For all that Chelsea dominate, it can count for little when you get down to the brass tacks. Three points are all that separate first from second. Two goals are all that separate Diego Costa (12) from Sergio Aguero (14). Chelsea can move six points clear with a win over West Ham in Boxing Day's early kick-off, though that luxury may only be afforded until Manchester City face West Brom later that afternoon. Still, Christmas comes and goes, the home straight begins. Mourinho and his three wise men have until May when the winner will get the spoils and the loser, nothing. Mourinho's men face an in-form West Ham team on Boxing Day but he may be without Hazard for the match . Thibaut Courtois doesn't feature in goalkeepers with the most saves,  nor does Joe Hart. They aren't called upon as much as Queens Park Rangers, Aston Villa and Burnley are. Chelsea have conceded the least in the Premier League (13), twinned with Southampton, and Manchester City are just one behind (14). The chasing pack (United, Arsenal, Liverpool) are represented (right). David De Gea, looking every bit the heir to Edwin van der Sar and Peter Schmeichel's throne, has made 50 saves. Thibaut Courtois (pictured) and Joe Hart don't make the list as they are not called upon as much . 63 - Green, QPR . 60 - Guzan, Aston Villa . 56 - Heaton, Burnley . 53 - Adrian, West Ham . 51 - Lloris, Tottenham . 50 - De Gea, Manchester United . 49 - Fabianski, Swansea . 49 - Foster, West Brom . 48 - Schmeichel, Leicester . 38 - Speroni, Crystal Palace . 38 - Szczesny, Arsenal . 38 - Mignolet, Liverpool .","Jose Mourinho's three wise men have been in fine Premier League form .

"Arsene Wenger has warned against expecting too much too soon of Theo Walcott - but would have no issues if the fit-again forward joined up with England for the November internationals. Walcott came off the bench for the last 10 minutes of Arsenal's 3-0 Barclays Premier League win over Burnley, and looked lively as he tested goalkeeper Tom Heaton with an angled drive after cutting in from the right. It has been a long road back for the 25-year-old, who suffered what would prove to be a seriuos knee injury during the closing stages of the FA Cup tie against Tottenham in January, ruling him out of contention for the World Cup. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arsene Wenger say Theo Walcott can go away with England . Theo Walcott (left) made his long-awaited comeback for Arsenal in Saturday's win against Burnley . Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger warned about expecting too much too soon from his England winger . Walcott could be included by Roy Hodgson for the upcoming Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia at Wembley and friendly in Scotland, which Wenger feels would do the player's reintegration a power of good. 'Hopefully Theo will come on and have no setbacks now, but we always have to be cautious. The battle is not won yet - at nine or 10 months out, you have ups or downs and I will have to manage that well,' said Wenger. 'If he wants to go (with England), I am happy for him to go and train, and maybe get a few minutes. 'I am happy for that because it will help his development. Is he completely ready? I think it is a bit early, but to be in the squad would be good for him.' Wenger has yet to decide whether to give Walcott a start against Anderlecht in the Champions League on Tuesday night. One player, though, set to be central to the Gunners' once again will be Alexis Sanchez. The Chile forward drew more plaudits after taking his tally to 10 with a brace to finally breakdown Burnley's stubborn resistance. Sanchez had been denied by a string of fine saves from Heaton, before charging on to the end of a deep cross by full-back Calum Chambers to power a header into the bottom corner. Walcott (pictured replacing Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain) was given the last 10 minutes against the Clarets . 'He finds the resources to get you a goal when it is 0-0, that is what is important,' said Wenger. 'It is always very interesting when you look at the number of goals people score - how many times do they score at 0-0? They are the guys who can really make the decision. 'Alexis has already had a lot of decisive goals and he doesn't score when it is 4-0, he scores when it is 0-0.' Wenger feels there is plenty more to come from the former Barcelona forward. 'We are in a job where you can always improve,' he said. 'Sanchez is unbelievably keen to develop, work and train - he just loves football.' Wenger, though, admits he will have to carefully temper Arsenal's formidable attacking options. 'We have good pace - (Danny) Welbeck, Walcott and Alexis all have pace, but it is also about balance,' the Arsenal boss added. 'The difficulty for us might be there, to keep the balance offensively and defensively and put all the good players on the pitch.'","Arsenal welcomed back Theo Walcott against Burnley .

"Swansea manager Garry Monk has labelled Aston Villa's in-form striker Christian Benteke a Boxing Day threat - but has hinted he would not swap him for his own powerhouse forward Wilfried Bony. Belgian powerhouse Benteke has been back to his best in recent weeks following injury and suspension, grabbing a superb solo winner in Villa's victory at Crystal Palace before scoring possibly an even better goal in the 1-1 draw against Manchester United last weekend. It has been a long road back for Benteke who missed six months and the World Cup after rupturing an Achilles tendon last March, but Ivory Coast striker Bony has had a profitable 2014, with his 20 goals making him the top scorer in the Barclays Premier League in the calendar year. Swansea City striker Wilfried Bony has scored more Premier League goals in 2014 than any other player . 'They're both very powerful but have different types of game,' Monk said ahead of Villa's Boxing Day visit to the Liberty Stadium. 'I would say Benteke is more mobile, a run-the-channels type and probably covers more yards than Bony. But Bony is more effective in what he does. 'They're very much quality players and Benteke's coming into a bit of form now, but I always knew he would. 'He's always been a good player, he had that serious injury and it always takes a little bit of time to get back that sharpness. 'That only comes with games but he's looking sharp now. Swansea manager Garry Monk said that while Christian Benteke is in impressive form, Bony is more effective . 'He's a big threat to us and we're going to have to deal with it.' Benteke's return following his dismissal against Tottenham at the start of November has coincided with an upturn in Villa fortunes, Paul Lambert's side taking seven points from the last 12 on offer. Gabriel Agbonlahor is available after having his red card against United rescinded on Tuesday and Monk is wary of the visitors even though eighth-placed Swansea are four places and five points better off than Villa. 'They've got good players all over the pitch attacking-wise and it's a game where we have to be very much on our toes,' Monk said. 'Look at their last performance against Man United and I thought they probably deserved to win the game. Monk was full of praise for Benteke but insisted that Bony was more effective at what he did . 'They've got a good squad and good players and they will be very dangerous, it's one we've got to be wary of. 'But the way we've played at home we've got to be confident of getting on the front foot and try to impose ourself on Aston Villa. 'There will be periods in the game where they will test us and we have to be ready for that, but confidence-wise we should be on all cylinders.' Monk made seven changes for last weekend's 1-0 win at Hull and Leon Britton, Jefferson Montero and Gylfi Sigurdsson could all return after niggles but the Swansea boss admits there will be plenty of squad rotation over the festive programme. Aston Villa's Belgian striker celebrates after scoring against Manchester United before Christmas . Swansea hit the road after the Villa game with league trips to Liverpool and QPR preceding an FA Cup third-round tie at League Two strugglers Tranmere on January 3. 'Three away games over this period is a tough ask but that's why the squad is there,' Monk said. 'We have to be very strong mentally but I think mentally we're in a very good place - not just the games but between games and preparation-wise. 'You've got to be prepared for everything but the players know what's coming up, they've all been through it and realise what it takes. 'The result at Hull is a good start coming into these games and hopefully we'll get that performance level and some points over this period.'","Swansea City will host Aston Villa in the Premier League on Boxing Day .

"The Football League is increasingly becoming the breeding ground for the country’s finest young talent. With the number of foreign players in the Premier League at record levels young, home grown professionals are often finding their best crack at reaching the top is to start in the lower divisions. Gareth Southgate’s England Under 21 side is filled with more Football League players now than ever and with clubs such as Swindon, MK Dons and Exeter all having squads packed full of academy products it is no surprise he is looking below the top flight. As 2015 approaches, Sportsmail takes a look at 10 young stars to watch out for in the Football League in the coming year… . Dele Alli (MK Dons, 18, midfielder) After a starring performance in MK Dons’ 4-0 Capital One Cup victory over Manchester United in August, Alli’s name will be familiar to many of you already. Courted by Liverpool, the heir apparent to Steven Gerrard possesses many qualities similar to that of the former England captain. With the strength and physique to play as a holding midfielder, Alli also has an eye for a goal with eight already to his name in League One this season. Not 19 until April, the 6ft 2in England youth international has over 60 first-team appearances to his name. Dele Alli boosted his profile in MK Dons’ 4-0 Capital One Cup victory over Manchester United in August . Diego De Girolamo (Sheff Utd/York, 19, forward) Chesterfield-born Italy youth international De Girolamo is currently enjoying a fruitful loan spell in League Two with York. The versatile forward has long been tipped for big things at Bramall Lane and with his temporary deal at Bootham Crescent expiring in the New Year, he’ll be hoping to force his way in to Nigel Clough’s first team as the Blades push for promotion. This is Sheffield United’s fourth consecutive season in the fourth tier but their academy keeps on producing. Midfielder Lou Reed, 17, is another to keep an eye out for. Sheffield United's Diego De Girolamo is currently enjoying a fruitful loan spell in League Two with York . Jake Forster-Caskey (Brighton, 20, midfielder) Despite Brighton’s struggles this season, Forster-Caskey continues to shine in midfield for the Seagulls. The 20-year-old has established himself as a regular starter in Gareth Southgate’s England Under 21 side alongside fellow Championship starlet, Derby’s Will Hughes. At ease on the ball on capable of the odd wondergoal with his ferocious left-foot, don’t be surprised to see Forster-Caskey playing the Premier League before too long. Son of former Tottenham midfielder Darren Caskey and stepson of ex-Brighton striker Nicky Forster. Jake Forster-Caskey (left), facing Tottenham's Harry Kane, continues to shine in midfield for Brighton . Joe Gomez (Charlton, 17, defender) Despite his age, Gomez is already an imposing and athletic figure at 6ft 2in. A centre back by trade, the former England Under 17 captain is capable of playing across the backline and has impressed at right back in recent weeks. Charlton manager Bob Peeters is a big fan and it surely won’t be long before Gomez ousts either of the ageing pair of Tal Ben Haim and Andre Bikey at the heart of Addicks’ defence. Joe Gomez (right), leaving Cameron Jerome on the floor, is already an imposing and athletic figure at 17 . Demarai Gray (Birmingham, 18, winger) Gray showcased his talent with a hat-trick in Birmingham’s recent 6-1 demolition of Reading at St Andrew’s. Lightning quick and capable of playing in a number of attacking positions, the England Under 19 international has been a key part of Birmingham’s revival since the appointment of Gary Rowett as manager. The second exciting winger to emerge from the Blues’ academy in recent years after England Under 21 international Nathan Redmond, now at Norwich. Demarai Gray showcased his talent with a hat-trick in Birmingham’s recent 6-1 demolition of Reading . Matt Grimes (Exeter, 19, midfielder) Swansea are prepared to pay north of £1.5million for Grimes and it’s easy to see why. The free-kick specialist possesses a wand of a left foot and his grounding in League Two has added graft and physicality to a naturally attacking game. Over half of Paul Tisdale’s squad Exeter came through Exeter’s academy and all are rapidly improving – none more so than Grimes, who is capable of playing out wide as well as in the centre of midfield. Swansea are prepared to pay north of £1.5million for Exeter's Matt Grimes and it’s easy to see why . Alex Mowatt (Leeds, 19, midfielder) Like Grimes and Forster-Caskey, Mowatt is another young, English, left-footed midfielder learning his trade in the Football League. Full of energy, not shy of a tackle and with a decent goalscoring record, Mowatt is the archetypal all-action midfielder. Mowatt is benefitting from having his former Leeds youth manager Neil Redfearn in charge of the first-team at Elland Road. He was inexplicably frozen out under Dave Hockaday at the start of the season but has now resumed on a path that could take him to the top of the English game. Leeds' Alex Mowatt is another young, English, left-footed midfielder learning his trade in the Football League . Patrick Roberts (Fulham, 17, forward) Roberts has had to make do with fleeting appearances off the bench this season despite Fulham’s struggles, but his talent is unquestionable. A diminutive, tricky left-footer with a low centre of gravity, Roberts is capable of playing in a number of attacking positions. He has been the star of England’s Under 17 and now Under 19 teams. Roberts is one of a number of talented youngsters coming through at Craven Cottage with midfielders Lasse Vigen Christensen and George Williams also seeing plenty of first-team action this season. Patrick Roberts has had to make do with  appearances off the bench this season despite Fulham’s struggles . Louis Thompson (Norwich/Swindon, 19, midfielder) Swindon have been one of the feel-good stories of the Football League season so far with Mark Cooper’s side sitting second in League One despite having just four players in their squad over the age of 23. Thompson, whose brother Nathan, 24, captains Cooper’s side, epitomises the youth and energy in the Robins’ ranks. Louis signed for Norwich in the summer and was immediately loaned back for the season. Expect to see him playing in the Championship next season - and possibly defender Nathan too. Louis Thompson signed for Norwich in the summer and was immediately loaned back for the season . Brad Walker (Hartlepool, 18, midfielder) It has been a disastrous season so far for Hartlepool and Walker but the rangy midfielder has shown enough in his fledgling career to date to suggest he can cut it at much higher level. Norwich, Stoke and Celtic have all been keeping tabs on the midfielder who broke into the Pools team at 17 and has already made well over 50 first-team appearances, scoring a few screamers along the way. Hartlepool are six points adrift at the bottom of League Two but if new manager Ronnie Moore can get League Two’s Apprentice of the Year back to his best they can stay up. It has been a disastrous season so far for Hartlepool but Brad Walker has shown plenty of potential . Jed Wallace (Portsmouth, 20, midfielder) Another midfield talent in League Two, Wallace has been a revelation since breaking in to the Pompey team in 2013. With 24 goals in 96 appearances, the former Farnborough youngster has a knack for popping up in the right place at the right time whether playing through the middle or out wide. The England Under 19 international, who scored six goals in League One as an 18-year-old, will surely play at a higher level in 2015, with or without Portsmouth.

"Besides gaining a badly needed win, the most pleasing aspect of Saturday's game for Louis van Gaal was naming Michael Carrick in his starting line-up for the first time. It’s been a long four months for the Dutchman since Carrick damaged ankle ligaments during his very first week in charge. Van Gaal predicted it would be a huge blow to his plans — he had even been considering Carrick as captain — and nothing that has happened since has proved him wrong. Michael Carrick gets in ahead of Marouane Chamakh as he made his long-awaited return to United's first team . Louis van Gaal will be delighted that his most reliable midfielder is now back fit and available for selection . Following surgery, rehab and one appearance as a substitute against Manchester City last week, Carrick was the man that Van Gaal turned to in a bid to lift United from their lowly starting position of 10th place. It wasn’t pretty and it had few of the thrills and spills that gave Old Trafford its reputation as the Theatre of Dreams but Carrick’s calm influence will have been of huge comfort to his manager.He’s that rarest of species, an English midfield player who is comfortable in possession and has a great passing range. Until now, Van Gaal’s United career has been like walking a tightrope without any safety net. So much has been made of the £158 million spent last summer, and a fearsome front four of Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie, Radamel Falcao, Juan Mata and Angel di Maria, that nobody appeared to have thought about the balance of the team. Carrick is a natural ball-player who looked at home in front of the back four in his first start after injury . The England midfielder protected United's inexperienced defence when Crystal Palace attemted to counter . Yesterday, Van Gaal took his most significant step to steady the wobble, sacrificing flair and excitement for control of the game and three points. Despite United’s defensive crisis — all four of their senior centre-halves were either injured or suspended — he resisted the temptation to ask Carrick to plug the gap at the back. Instead, Daley Blind was asked to move positions and Carrick was told to do what he does best, sit in front of the back four, protect against counter-attacks and control his side’s play. ‘I felt comfortable, being sub last week helped,’ said the 33-year-old. ‘I played centre-half in that game at City but the manager decided to swap it today. Daley (Blind) is left-footed so he’s a more comfortable left-sided centre-back.’ Angel di Maria and Wayne Rooney may be more fashionable, but Carrick's return is crucial to United . The United star was back in his favoured position after filling in at centre-back against Manchester City . Though United were far from their best, Carrick did his job. He didn’t hare about crunching into tackles but his reading of the game meant he didn’t need to. ‘It worked OK. They let us have possession but creating chances is the difficult bit when teams defend like that in numbers. We got the win in the end though.’ The only genuine chance for the visitors, hooked over by Frazer Campbell, came when Paddy McNair and Blind failed to deal with a cross from the left. Carrick emerged unscathed from a number of 50-50 challenges and, more importantly, was always on hand to receive the ball and invariably use it in the right way. United had 72 per cent possession and while they didn’t pepper Palace’s goal, their control led to Juan Mata’s breakthrough midway through the second half. At times, you could see Carrick directing with discreet signals to his team-mates, very much the senior figure taking responsibility. Carrick waves to the Old Trafford faithful after a successful return in the narrow win over Palace . Daley Blind, a left-footed player, shifted into defence, allowing Carrick to do what he does best in midfield . It rubbed off on the younger players around him, too. It was no coincidence Carrick’s return coincided with Luke Shaw’s best game for United. The left-back surged forward knowing he would receive the right pass at the right time, and nearly scored from one such foray, only to see his shot beaten away by Julian Speroni. And after United had scored, when Palace were pushing for an equaliser, Carrick tracked back to block a Fraizer Campbell shot. He is one of those players most appreciated when he’s been missing. Van Gaal appreciates him, and so does Roy Hodgson, which is why he’s walked straight back into the England squad to face Slovenia and Scotland.","Manchester United win 1-0 at home to Crystal Palace .

'I think overall Brendan's done very, very well, it's just that the demands from last season, going so high, are seemingly making what's happening now look nowhere near as good as before. 'He's a good guy, I like him a lot and respect him. 'We have to have people doing well who are English or British, fuelling the belief at the top level, from boards and fans even, that there are good English, British coaches out there doing good work.'

"This is one dog that really doesn't like Christmas. So when Norman the  bullmastiff's owner begins singing the 12 Days of Christmas, the grumpy dog tries to do anything to make him stop. This hilarious video shows Curt Kendall  singing the Christmas carol in a high falsetto, as poor Norman attempts to drown it out by whining and barking. But when that doesn't work, the giant canine refuses to leave his master's side but decides to muffle the awful sound by lying across his owner's face - just as Curt launches into five gold rings. Scroll down for video . Norman the bullmastiff really hates Christmas (pictured with one of his owners Curt Kendall) As Curt begins singing the 12 Days of Christmas, the grumpy dog tries to do anything to make him stop . The clip ends with the owner eventually  giving up the song and giving Norman a kiss. On his You Tube page, Curt wrote: 'Norman hates Christmas, but he really HATES when I sing. He gets so embarrassed. It's torture for him! 'Merry Christmas from our Bullmastiff Scrooge!!' Curt, who owns his beloved pet with partner Jason Kasal, had first recorded the video as an alternative to a Christmas card for Jason who was away travelling. But the animal lover, from Indiana in America, had never expected the reaction the video, which has been seen over 6 million times, would receive. To celebrate reaching the 1 million mark, Norman even got a cheeseburger. On his Facebook page, curt thanked the millions who had watched and shared the clip. 'Thanks for sharing our video! It was just going to be our Christmas card! (Because we are lazy). Me and Norman and Jason have had a lot of fun with this! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.'

"With their moody murder mysteries, flatpacked furniture, and minimalistic designs, you may be fooled into thinking that Swedish Christmas is a modest affair. However, when it comes to celebrating the holidays, the Swedes tend to go for more is more - at least in the food and drinks department. The Swedes celebrate Christmas on Christmas Eve instead of Christmas Day, and as one of the most secular countries in the world, the festivities are rarely about the birth of Christ. This is just the starter: A small version of a traditional Swedish Julbord - Christmas Table - a smorgasbord enjoyed across the country on Christmas Eve . THE FOOD . Swedish people take their Christmas-time eating very seriously, and most families serve the traditional Julbord (Christmas Table) – a winter-season smorgasbord. To most Swedes, the idea of only having one kind of meat for Christmas dinner is absurd. Julbord is eaten in ‘rounds’, requiring several visits to the smorgasbord to refill the plate. Traditionally, the rounds are; herring, salmon and cold meats, entrees, and dessert (if there is still space). As well as the inevitable different types of pickled herring to start, the most common dishes include Christmas roast ham, Christmas sausages, meatballs (obviously), pork ribs, gravadlax, smoked salmon, beetroot salad, cheeses, and Jansson's Frestelse - a casserole dish made of potatoes, pickled sprats and cream. The Julbord differs somewhat between north and south, and families hailing from the farming lowlands of Scania often serve geese, duck and eel, while those from the colder latitudes go for reindeer, deer and cloudberry jam. One thing is consistent throughout the land – there is lots of it. Pickled fish and shots: A proper Swedish Julbord will have at least three different types of herring and shots of frozen aquavit is served in constantly refilled long-stemmed shotglasses . THE DRINK . Drinking during Christmas is considered an artform among Swedes. Glögg, a Scandinavian version of mulled wine is drunk steaming hot with raisins and almonds at any time during the Christmas period, but the real deal starts with the first Julbord round on Christmas Eve. Enter: Aquavit. Aquavit is a spirit flavoured with botanicals and herbs, one of which must be dill or caraway, which  tends to have an ABV of 35-40 per cent. Many Swedes have a selection of different aquavits ready in the freezer ahead of  the Julbord. The aquavit is served frozen in long-stemmed shotglasses and works both as a palate cleanser and digestif during the Julbord, which sometimes involves several hours of eating. Traditionally, someone around the table suggests a toast, which sees the entire table burst into a song known as ‘snapsvisa’ – a short and often humours chanson describing how much the table is going to enjoy drinking the aquavit. When the song is over, the aquavit is 'taken', like a shot. THE ENTERTAINMENT . The Swedes have a slightly odd tradition of religiously watching the same 1950s Disney cartoons over and over again. To a Swede, there is nothing that says Christmas like Donald Duck. At 3pm sharp on Christmas Eve, SVT - The Swedish BBC - broadcasts 'Kalle Anka och hans vänner önskar God Jul' (Donald Duck and his friends wish you a Merry Christmas). This is a 1958 Disney Christmas special called From All of Us to All of You, where Jiminy Cricket, Mickey and Donald presents about a dozen animated shorts and clips from Disney films from the 30s-60s. Millions of Swedes sit down at 3pm and watch the exact same shows year after year(it has been broadcast since 1959). God forbid you would record it or mix things up. For a progressive country they sure hate change: Disney's 1958 Christmas Special has been shown on Swedish television at 3pm on Christmas Eve since 1959 - millions still watch every year . And what would a good old Social Democrat Christmas be without Karl-Bertil Jonsson's Christmas Eve, a 1975 animated short-film set during the Second World War. It tells the Robin Hood-like story of 14-year-old Karl-Bertil who works in a post office and steals Christmas presents addressed to rich people in order to give them to the poor. At 7pm, the Swedes gather in front of the television set and try to forget that 13 per cent of them voted for a right-wing anti-immigrant party in the last general election. The Swedes do not open their Christmas presents at dawn, but instead keep all gifts under the tree which are then handed from giver to recipient in a present ceremony at some point during the day (normally between the Julbord and Karl-Bertil Jonsson). Like his distant relative Queen Elizabeth II, the King of Sweden holds and annual Christmas Speech, but not until Christmas Day when most Swedes are still recovering from food coma. ELSEWHERE.. Although the Scandilands have much in common when it comes to Christmas Eve traditions, the foods differ somewhat. In Denmark, families stay away from the gluttony of its neighbours, serving Christmas Duck with sugar-fried potatoes and gravy, accompanied by wine. However, this is only a respite from the snaps and smorgasbord, as the Danes enjoy Julefrokost (Christmas Breakfast, similar to the Swedish Julbord) throughout December, and on Christmas Day and Boxing Day. The Norwegians generally, also have a ‘smorgasbord-free’ Christmas Eve, but still serve multiple entrees during dinner, such as lamb-ribs, deer, turkey and fish. The Finns do not stray far from the Swedes when it comes to food (and drink), but there can be no Christmas in the Finnish homes before the Christmas sauna.","Swedish Christmas traditions involve copious amounts of food and drink .

"When thinking of scary types of dogs, one might imagine an American Pit Bull Terrier or a Rottweiler.

"A millionaire fed up with being abused for driving a 2012 Lamborghini has released a video revealing just what it's like to be behind the wheel of the world's most revered sports car. Allen Wong, a millionaire originally from New York City, was inspired by a video in which a woman was filmed walking through the city as she was relentlessly cat called and approached by men. So Mr Wong decided to use the cameras he had installed in his car to show both the good and the bad  reactions he receives while driving a £260,000 ($410,000) sports car. Mr Wong recorded the video to show people's reactions when he drives his 2012 Lamborghini Aventador (pictured) through New York . This passing motorist was complementary - he called Mr Wong's Lamborghini 'beautiful' A man pretends to wipe dust off the edge of Mr Wong's Lamborghini as he navigates a corner in New York . While driving through New York in his blue 2012 Lamborghini Aventador the video shows people  pawing at his car, complementing him, or insulting him. For better or worse, the video makes it clear that the car turns heads. Mr Wong said: 'I've had issues before where complete strangers would throw coins at my car simply for having an expensive car. 'I figured that having cameras would deter them and I would have protection against insurance scammers. 'The worst encounter I had was when three young adult males were sitting on the hood of my Lamborghini Gallardo at a parking lot and were catcalling the girls that were walking by. The hood couldn't support all of their weight, so it bent inwards as they were sitting on it. 'There were several occasions when a key in the back pocket or a metal button on (strangers') pants would leave a deep scratch on the car after sitting on it. 'I've caught more than a dozen people sitting on my cars and I don't know how many there are that I didn't catch sitting on the car. Most of the time, they do it to take a picture of themselves.' A man stares in disbelief as he walks past Mr Wong's Lamborghini. The model he is driving retails at £260,000 ($410,000) In this interaction, a stranger gives a pointed complement about Mr Wong's license plate . This man yelled unintelligibly and pulled the finger at Mr Wong as he drove past him . Two men wearing hi-visibility vests stare at the 2012 Lamborghini while crossing the street . Mr Wong is aged in his 20s and became a millionaire after creating a phone app called 5-0 Radio, a police scanner app. He said his video began as a 'parody' of the now-infamous NYC cat calling footage, but claims it has a 'very real message telling people to stop damaging other people's property'. 'I just hope that people would stop laying their hands or butts on cars that they do not own. They may not understand that rubbing paint while dirt/dust is on it leaves visible scratch marks and swirls on the car.'","Allen Wong made millions after he created a phone app called Radio 5-0 .

"One of the richest towns in Britain also has the highest number of people having extramarital affairs, according to new research. Wealthy Maidenhead tops a new UK Infidelity Index listing the towns where the highest percentage of the population are cheating on their partners. The Berkshire borough has 1,316 people having or actively seeking affairs using dating website Illicit Encounters out of a population of 63,580, meaning that at least two per cent of the town is cheating. In second place is Livingston in West Lothian, Scotland, with 1,080 cheats (1.91 per cent of the population) and Farnborough in Surrey comes third. The most faithful town according to the site is . Bournemouth in Dorset, probably due to high numbers of elderly residents . who are more settled in their relationships. Many of the towns with the highest numbers of cheats are wealthy areas in the south of England. Maidenhead has more millionaires than any other town in England outside of London. With an average house price of more than £450,00 and an idyllic riverside location, it is one of the most desirable places to live in the UK. Dating site Illicit Encounters has over 880,000 registered users and the site has seen a 40 per cent surge in registrations in the last five years which it puts down to couples not being able to divorce due economic pressures and rising house prices.

Brazen Louise Van der Velde, 40, is a member of Illicit Encounters and regularly sees wealthy men on the site for dates and sex. Louise, the widow of a doctor, does this with the full knowledge and agreement of her boyfriend, Mark Howard, 39, a fitness instructor. Mother-of-two Louise said: ‘I enjoy being in a relationship but I also crave the excitement of meeting new people. ‘I have been on Illicit Encounters for around six months and during that time I have had affairs with five men. Louise Van der Velde is a member of Illicit Encounters and sees men on the site with the full knowledge and agreement of her boyfriend, Mark Howard (right) ‘They have mostly been rich . businessmen in the commuter belt around Surrey who are bored in their . marriages and are seeking sex, fun and a change in their daily routine.

One of her lovers is a 48-year-old banker who has been on the site for five years and is married with two teenage children. Louise said: ‘He adores his wife but there is no sexual spark anymore and they have not made love for the last few years. Neither wants to divorce and they are loving parents to their children so he sees women very discreetly for sex without his wife’s knowledge.' Louise lives with Mark in Camberley, Surrey, where 616 people are having affairs through the site, according to the Infidelity Index. She said: ‘If you are looking to have an extramarital affair, the Surrey commuter belt is perfect. ‘There are plenty of middle class people in the Acacia Avenues around here craving some added excitement in their lives.' Mark said: ‘I am fully aware of Louise’s lifestyle and don’t see anything wrong with it. We are completely honest with each other. ‘The days when couples were happy to stay faithful to the same partner for 50 years or longer are over for many people.’ Amazingly Louise is a Harley Street-based relationship expert. She specialises in counselling couples on how they can enjoy life with more than one partner. She added: ‘Monogamy is out. I’m living a new model of relationship and it really works.’ A spokesman for Illicit Encounters said: 'Spiralling house prices have made divorce increasingly difficult for many couples.

He pleaded for good treatment, reminding the militants that his son was a Muslim, the same faith as the ultraconservative group. He said: 'Now he is in the hands of Islamic State fighters and I do not want to describe him as a hostage. I call him a guest. He is a guest among brothers of ours in Syria's Islamic State. 'I ask them in the name of God, and I ask with the dignity of the prophet Mohammed, peace be upon him, to receive him as a guest at his hosts' and treat him well.' He added: 'We are all Muslims.' The pilot, 1st Lt. Mu'ath al-Kaseasbeh, was captured after his warplane crashed in the militant stronghold of Raqqa on Wednesday while carrying out airstrikes against the militant group.There has been no word on his fate since his capture. Scroll down for video . Safi al-Kasaesbeh, father of Jordanian pilot Muath, who was captured by Islamic State after his plane came down near Raqqa in Syria on Wednesday, speaks on a telephone as he follows the news of his son in the house of a relative in Amman . Muath's father said that he is refusing to describe his son as a 'hostage', but rather as a guest of the Islamic State . The mother of a Jordanian fighter pilot (pictured in white top) captured by Isis after his plane crashed has spoken of her anguish at the news . This picture shows the captured Jordanian pilot, naked from the waist down, being carried out of a body of water by militants after his F-16 crashed . Jihadists captured First Lieutenant Mu'ath Safi Yousef al-Kaseasbeh (second right) after his warplane came down while conducting airstrikes over Syria . Mr al-Kaseasbeh said his wife was 'devastated' when told that the terrorists had seized their son, according to Al Arabiya News. Jordanian Information Minister Mohammad Momani told The Associated Press that the plane was shot down by 'ground fire' but did not elaborate. But last night, the US dismissed claims Isis were responsible for bringing the aircraft down. It was the first instance of a foreign soldier falling into the group's hands since the U.S.-led coalition began its air campaign against the extremists. The plea from the pilot's father came as distraught relatives gathered outside the family home and at the tribe's chamber to hear the latest news about him and to discuss what can be done to save him. The Raqqa Media Center published a photograph said to be of the pilot - in a white shirt, naked from the waist down and sopping wet - being pulled by gunmen out of what appeared to be a lake. Another picture shows him surrounded by more than a dozen fighters, some of them masked. The center said IS fighters are scouring the area in case there is a second pilot. A coalition official, who was not authorised to discuss the episode publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, said the pilot was in an F-16 fighter and was able to eject. U.S. Central Command, the body overseeing the coalition air war over Iraq and Syria, said last night: 'Evidence clearly indicates that ISIL did not down the aircraft as the terrorist organisation is claiming.' The statement did not give a cause for the 'crash,' and confirmed the lost jet's Jordanian pilot had been taken captive by IS guerrillas. 'We strongly condemn the actions of ISIL, which has taken captive the downed pilot,' said CentCom commander General Lloyd Austin. 'We will support efforts to ensure his safe recovery, and will not tolerate ISIL's attempts to misrepresent or exploit this unfortunate aircraft crash for their own purposes. 'The Jordanians are highly respected and valued partners and their pilots and crews have performed exceptionally well over the course of this campaign,' he added. The pilot's capture raises a nightmare scenario for Jordan, which has been sharply criticized by militant sympathizers for its participation. IS in the past has beheaded dozens of Syrian soldiers it captured in operations around the country. The group has also beheaded three Americans and two Britons.

Trophy: Parts of the F-16 were put on display in the Isis stronghold of Raqqa . Friends and relatives of Mu'ath Safi al-Kaseasbeh gather in the town of Aey near Al Karak in southern Jordan . There have been contradictory accounts of how the Jordanian pilot's plane crashed. Relatives of the pilot (pictured) met to see what could be done about the situation . Mu'ath Safi al-Kaseasbeh is the first foreign military member to fall into Isis' hands since an international coalition launched its bombing campaign against the group months ago. The pilot's clan gathered last night to discuss the crisis . Jordan's military said in a statement that as its air force was carrying out a military mission against the Islamic State group Wednesday morning, 'one of our warplanes crashed,' it said. 'The pilot was taken hostage by the Daesh terrorist organization,' it added, using the Arabic acronym for the Isalmic State group. It said IS and 'those who support it' will be responsible for the safety of the pilot. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it had confirmation from activists on the ground that the aircraft was shot down. Earlier Independent Defence Analyst Paul Beaver warned that Isis is capable of downing warplanes. He told MailOnline: 'Isis do have the capability to hit aircraft, as they have surface-to-air missiles and heavy machine guns.' This picture shows the captured Jordanian pilot posing next to a warplane . Mu'ath Safi Yousef al-Kaseasbeh pictured here riding a quad bike in the desert . It was not immediately known how the fighters shot down the warplane. But the Islamic State group is known to have stocks of Russian-made Igla anti-aircraft missiles. The shoulder-fired weapon has long been in the Syrian and Iraqi government arsenals - it was used during the 1991 Gulf War by Iraqi forces to down a British Tornado jet, for example. More recently, militants in Chechnya have used them to down Russian helicopters. The Raqqa Media Center, an agency of activists that operates openly in IS-ruled areas with permission of the group, said the plane was downed near the village of Hamra Ghannam outside Raqqa. It posted photos of militants posing with shards of wreckage and the canopy being loaded onto a van and then placed in the centre of Raqqa seemingly as a trophy. It also posted a phot of the pilot's military identification card, identifying him as First Lieutenant Mu'ath Safi Yousef al-Kaseasbeh, aged 27. In October it was reported that Isis is now in possession of MANPADS - shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles . In Jordan, the pilot's cousin Marwan al-Kaseasbeh confirmed by telephone with The Associated Press that the photos are of his cousin. A friend said Kasaesbeh, who is from a prominent Jordanian family, was fervent in his commitment to his mission and felt it was a religious duty to fight extremist groups such as Islamic State that were 'distorting the true spirit of Islam'. Momani said al-Kaseasbeh, who got married in July, was 'a symbol of heroism and sacrifice'. He added that 'the war on terrorism will continue', saying that the fight with the extremists was 'to defend the Islamic religion'. The United States and several Arab allies have been striking the Islamic State group in Syria since September 23, and U.S. and other international warplanes have been waging an air campaign against the extremists in Iraq for even longer. The campaign aims to push back the jihadi organization after it took over much of Iraq and Syria and declared a 'caliphate.' Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates are participating in the Syria strikes, with Qatari logistical support. Staunch U.S. ally Jordan has provided a logistics base for the U.S.-led air campaign and is a hub for intelligence-gathering operations against the jihadists, a western diplomatic source said. King Abdullah has been in the forefront of regional U.S. allies supportive of the campaign but has said radical Sunni extremists cannot defeated by military means alone and their ideology must be confronted with reason. In Washington, a Pentagon official said they are aware of the claims being made over social media that a pilot has been shot down, but they could not confirm the report at this time. The official said any further questions about the alleged capture should be referred to the government of Jordan. He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the reports by name. The Islamic State group is known to have stocks of Russian-made Igla anti-aircraft missiles (pictured), which may have been used to down the F-16 jet . Over the past week, Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga fighters have been battling Isis to liberate the town of Sinjar, a tiny desert community in northern Iraq that the gunmen overran in August, massacring and enslaving hundreds of its residents. The Islamic State group swept into Sinjar and surrounding villages as part of their summer blitz across northern Iraq. The advance of the extremists struck particular fear there. Much of the population belongs to the minority Yazidi religious community, a tiny sect that the Sunni Muslim radicals consider heretics. Hundreds were killed, and hundreds more Yazidi women and girls were taken captive by the militants, turned into sex slaves or forcibly 'married' to Islamic State supporters in Syria and Iraq. Thousands of other Yazidis fled into Mount Sinjar, a long, steep mountain range that erupts from the flat desert landscape and looms over the town. There they languished for weeks with little food or protection until they were rescued, many by Syrian Kurds who freed a corridor to reach them. Now, Iraqi Kurdish fighters are on an offensive to push back the Islamic State in this corner of Iraq near the Syrian border. Meanwhile, officials say a suicide attack against pro-government, anti-Islamic State group Sunni militias near Baghdad has killed at least 13 people. A police officer says the attacker blew himself up early Wednesday morning among a group of militiamen gathered at a military base south of Baghdad to receive their monthly payment. He said 10 militiamen and three soldiers were killed and 25 others wounded. The group, known as Sahwa, is made up of Sunni militiamen who joined U.S. troops in the fight against al-Qaida during the height of the insurgency in 2007 and 2008. They are viewed as traitors by the Sunni militants. A medical official confirmed the casualty figures. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to release information to the media.","Jihadists captured a Jordanian fighter pilot after his warplane crashed .

"We've seen some odd flavours of ice cream recently. There's been olive oil from Ginger Comfort Emorium, watercress delight from Purbeck Ice Cream, and even a brussel sprout offering from London restaurant Vivat Bacchus. But Britain has been beaten once again in the food stakes by the Japanese. A few months ago Femail reported one Tokyo restaurant was serving a menu seasoned with fresh dirt. And now, Kobe's Torimi (Bird) Cafe is serving a line of three ice creams modelled on breeds of small bird - java sparrow, parakeet and cockatiel. Would YOU try some bird flavoured ice cream? One Japanese cafe thinks you should . Served at the Osaka Small Bird Expo in the Hanshin Department Store, Torimi Cafe sees visitors flock to be surrounded by 36 pet birds in their unique space. The cafe say they use all natural ingredients which cost 'a little more than normal ice cream ingredients' to make their wacky dairy treats. They were using the expo as a test run to see if the ice cream would sell well enough to recoup the costs, according to Rocket News 24. If successful these ice creams would be sold at their shop in Kobe and through delivery. Torimi Cafe initially announced: 'Once in your mouth, the aroma of a parakeet would spread intensely.' If you're wondering how exactly the cafe found out what these cute birds taste like... read on for a run down of the three flavours. The . java sparrow is a small chubby bird which feeds on grains and seeds. In . that spirit, you are treated to vanilla ice cream with grains mixed in. As the ice cream melts in your mouth . you might feel something squishy rolling around, just like a java . sparrow on your tongue. That would be the marshmallows hidden inside. According to Torimi Cafe: 'It’s the feeling of pressing the breast of a java sparrow into your mouth.' Perhaps you could enjoy this tasty treat with your pet bird? The cafe hasn't confirmed it fit for bird consumption . Parakeets are known to be more lively . and active birds and as such the mellow taste of the java sparrow ice . cream is jazzed up with some honey and apple. There are still some grains mixed in, but to a lesser extent. As Torimi Cafe put it, 'it’s like . eating some vanilla ice cream in one hand and then taking a whiff of a . parakeet in your other hand.' Cockatiel ice cream remains lively . with the taste of honey-apple, but rather than grains, is mixed with . larger pumpkin and sunflower seeds. The effect is a rumbling and bouncy . taste which, in the words of Torimi Cafe, is like 'when you’re sleeping . with your mouth open and your cockatiel runs over your face and gets its . leg in your mouth.'

"Disgraced: Florida osteopath Dr Daniel McBath has been banned from treating female patients in light of allegations of sexual abuse and professional misconduct dating back to 2004 . A Florida doctor has been accused of repeatedly drugging at least three female patients with cocaine and sedatives and sexually assaulting them. Dr Daniel McBath, an osteopath from Dade City had his license restricted by the state last week for 'egregious and predatory' behavior involving three women. Under an emergency order issued by the Department of Health, McBath can no longer treat female patients at his McBath Medical Center at 23933 17th Street in Dade City. According to the 34-page order signed by State Surgeon General John Armstrong and cited by WPTV, McBath repeatedly drugged and sexually assaulted a patient with a history of abuse between June 2009 and January 2014. The doctor diagnosed the victim with obesity, even though at the time the 5-foot-7 woman a weighed only 135lbs. He later diagnosed the woman with hormonal imbalance, chronic pain, anxiety and fatigue 'without any supporting medical justification,' the order states, and prescribed her a cocktail of Adderall, Xanax, hydrocodone and B-12 shots. On at least one occasion, McBath allegedly injected a white liquid into the patient’s vagina, telling her it would give her a stronger sex drive. In the course of her treatment, the 35-year-old woman came to McBath's house and he instructed her to put on his wife's clothes, which she refused to do. The doctor and patient drank alcohol and used cocaine. The order states the woman then passed out and later woke up in McBath's bed. The physician allegedly assaulted some of the victims at his McBath Medical Center at 23933 17th Street in Dade City . With the woman slipping in and out of consciousness, McBath injected her with an unknown substance in her vagina and then proceeded to have sex with her, along with another man who was at the house, the document claims. Identified on;y as Mr DH’ in the order, the man allegedly had vaginal, oral and anal sex with the woman. McBath later also penetrated her with his hand, causing her to bleed profusely. On another occasion, McBath allegedly asked the patient to rub her privates with a cigar. Months later, the doctor took a photo of the woman’s vagina without her consent, the order states. In July 2004, McBath's then-26-year-old intern reported an incident during which the married doctor came over to her house to teach her how to perform a varicose vain removal procedure. Both of them drank beer and McBath gave the intern two blue pills telling her it was an antibiotic. The medicine made the woman feel woozy, which McBath claimed was a reaction to the antibiotic. While McBath was performing a 'chiropractic manipulation' on his employee, the order states he rolled her on her back, took her face in his hands and told her he had 'wanted to do this since the second day of work.' Family man: McBath has a wife, Brenda (left), and two grown daughters . The well-respected doctor then started kissing her on her mouth and breasts despite her protestations, according to the order, before exposing his erect penis and asking her if she 'wanted some of this.' The intern then lost consciousness. She came to on McBath's couch sometime later and was told by the doctor that they had 'made love,' the order states. The 26-year-old found her neck to be covered in 'love bites' and later tested positive for a sedative. The most recent incident involving Dr McBath dates to April of this year when he allegedly gave his long-time patient a shot for a suspected urinary tract infection, which caused her to pass out. The 32-year-old woman, who has been McBath’s patient since age 14, woke up on his couch four hours later. She too tested positive for the same sedative as the intern. When the patient reported the incident to police, detectives had her call McBath to talk to him about what happened between them, with officers listening in on their conversation. Betrayal of trust: McBath, pictured left and right with his wife, is accused of drugging a 26-year-old intern and exposing himself to her before she lost consciousnesses. He later said they had 'made love' 'Egregious': The doctor allegedly drugged and sexually assaulted a 35-year-old woman with a history of abuse between June 2009 and January 2014 after misdiagnosing her with obesity . McBath allegedly told the woman that they did not have sex and instructed her not to talk about this to anyone. McBath, who has a wife and two grown daughters, has not been charged with any crime pending an investigation by the local sheriff’s department. When contacted by Tampa Bay Times for a comment on the allegations, the doctor has denied the patients’ claims, calling them ‘pathetic’ and saying they were the result of retaliation, but he would not say for what. ‘Dr. McBath demonstrated predatory behavior,’ the emergency order in the case concludes. ‘The number of patients that have reported the sexual misconduct and administration of substances without consent indicates that Dr. McBath's conduct will continue.’","Osteopath Dr Daniel McBath has been banned from treating female patients in light of allegations .

"Click here for your ultimate stats guide, including Enner Valencia's wonder strike . Well, no one can say they didn’t get value for money. On a night when Hull’s £10million record signing Abel Hernandez announced his arrival in English football with an excellent goal, he was upstaged by West Ham’s new £12m man Enner Valencia. It did not end there. Hull’s other debutant Mohamed Diame, who left Upton Park under something of a cloud two weeks ago to move to Humberside, appeared to have stolen the headlines when he scored against his old club but Diafra Sakho, another of West Ham’s new signings from Metz, saw his shot helped over the line by the hapless Curtis Davies. It was difficult to know who was happier with a point from an entertaining contest between two managers who are not always known for their open style of play. Senegalese Mo Diame (hidden from view) is mobbed by his new Hull team-mates after giving his side a 2-1 lead at the KC Stadium . Enner Valencia - signed by West Ham for £12million this summer - hammers home a wonder strike from 25 yards on his debut . Valencia's 20-yard strike took just 0.7 seconds to travel from his boot to the goal at a speed of 70.1mph .

Sam Allardyce even set up West Ham with a midfield diamond formation that helped produce the kind of flowing football the club’s owners and supporters have demanded of him for so long. ‘I’m sure me and Sam will have a beer now and say “hey, we don’t normally play like that”,’ admitted Hull boss Steve Bruce. Yet, amazingly, we had to wait half an hour for the first shot in anger, a wayward effort from Stewart Downing that flew well wide. It was the trigger for a frenetic end to the first half that saw Valencia and Sakho go close before Hernandez struck. The Uruguayan had only secured a work permit and trained with his new teammates for the first time over the weekend before Bruce took the decision to start him. When Jake Livermore knocked the ball back to Ahmed Elmohamady on the right and his cross picked out Hernandez, the former Palermo striker got up ahead of James Tomkins to send a fantastic header swerving inside Adrian’s left-hand post. ‘He was full of life in training and that was what made my mind up, so I thought just throw him in,’ said Bruce. ‘But if you saw him now poor kid! ‘He has been waiting for two weeks. He has been away in Japan and South Korea and then stuck in Rome for the past couple of days waiting for his passport. We picked up his work permit on Friday and flew to Italy to get him.’ Hernandez almost had another goal with a cracking effort off the underside of the bar — Nikica Jelavic was offside when he headed in from the rebound — but it was nothing compared to Valencia’s wonder strike in the 50th minute. Valencia appeared to have run out of options when he carried the ball infield and came to a halt 25 yards from goal. There was almost no backlift at all as he took aim and sent a spectacular effort flying beyond Allan McGregor and into the top corner.

Data courtesy of the EA SPORTS Player Performance Index, the Official Player Rating Index of the Barclays Premier League . The Ecuador World Cup star had already made two League appearances since arriving from Mexican club Pachuca, but this was his first start and he marked the occasion with his first goal. And what a goal it was. ‘Everyone can see why we bought him with that strike,’ said Allardyce. ‘It was one of the best we’ll see this season. The power and the accuracy of the shot was past McGregor before he could even move. It stunned the whole stadium, it was that good.’ With 25 minutes to go, Diame of all people struck against his old club. Worse still for West Ham, it came from their own throw-in from Aaron Cresswell. His delivery was aimed towards Cheikhou Kouyate but Diame touched it away from him and closed in on goal. There was still plenty to do as Tomkins tried to block his path but the man from Senegal could not have placed it any better, curling the ball around the defender and just inside the post. Did Big Sam see that one coming from his old player? ‘Yeah,’ he said. ‘What sickened me most was the way we gifted him the ball, but it would have sickened me more if it had been the winner.’ Thankfully for Allardyce, he only had to wait three minutes for the equaliser. Downing played a pass into Sakho whose his first-time shot squirmed past McGregor and Davies could only help it into the goal. There was still time for Michael Dawson to rescue Hull when he intercepted Valencia’s downward header as it flew goalwards and chested it against the bar. ‘If that had gone in I was up and ready to start dancing,’ said Allardyce. ‘And that isn’t a pleasant sight.’ Valencia announces his arrival in the Premier League with West Ham in the ascendency in the second half .

"The suicide rate is skyrocketing in Greece as the economic catastrophe engulfing the nation shows no signs of letting up. A sun-kissed land with once the lowest recorded suicide rates in Europe, Greece has seen a huge spike in people taking their own lives. Experts believe that not all suicides are the result of depression; some are ending it all in an act of ultimate political protest. Greece used to have the lowest recorded suicide rates in Europe. Recently, there has been a spike in people taking their own lives, however . More than 2,500 people have taken their own lives since 2010. 'This is the number for confirmed suicides. We think the real number is much higher,' said psychiatrist Dimitris Boukouras. He mans a psyhiatric hotline that rings off the hook every day. Greece, which is headed for an autumn bankruptcy unless it does more to reign in spending and release fresh IMF funds worth 40 billion euros, saw 50 deaths and a further 350 suicide attempts in the capital Athens in June alone. Deaths are rising across the country and on the numerous islands that surround Greece. Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras will next week hold his first meetings with euro zone leaders since taking office, striving to assure them he will honour a pledge for more austerity and gauging whether they could grant him more time to pull it off. Mr Samaras will insist he can ram through an austerity package worth about 11.5 billion euros ($14.2 billion) - a key condition to continue receiving EU/IMF bailout funds and avoid default and a possible exit from the currency club. Greece has yet to nail down the requested austerity package. The bulk of the cuts will come from state salaries and pensions, and up to 40,000 public sector firings, further angering an austerity-weary public that often takes to the streets. The coalition's two leftist junior partners have also opposed any further cuts. Mr Samaras said: 'We're all having a difficult time. There will be more hardship'. The Greek people have been hit hard by austerity cuts which have led some to take their lives . The first four months of this year saw a surge in the number of suicides among the poor and those older than 65. It has risen by more than 33 percent against the same period for 2011 - 700 people taking their lives since January 1. Before the financial crisis began, Greece had the lowest suicide rate in Europe at 2.8 per 100,000 inhabitants, according to Eurostat. 'Most of the suicides were among members of the middle class and, in many cases, the act itself was carried out in public, almost as if it were a theatrical performance,' commented Germany's Der Spiegel magazine this week. Rising in tandem is the usage of anti-depressant drugs; up 25 percent on last year in Athens, 18 percent across the country as a whole. Deaths like that of a 77-year-old pharmacist who shot himself to death on Syntagma Square in downtown Athens in April, and Dimitris Christoulas, who blew his brains out at the same place in the same month, have captured headlines and stoked fears among experts that worse is to come. People have hanged themselves in public, set alight to themselves in public and died in numerous other ways in the privacy of their own homes. A note written in red letters on a piece of cardboard are pinned on a memorial to Christoulas in Athens. They read: 'The government has annihilated all traces for my survival, which was based on a very dignified pension that I alone paid into for 35 years with no help from the state. 'I see no other solution than this dignified end to my life so that I don't find myself fishing through garbage cans for my sustenance. 'I believe that young people with no future will one day take up arms and hang the traitors of this country on Syntagma Square.' The newspaper Ta Nea describes the mood among Greeks as a 'society on the verge of a nervous breakdown.' Many Greeks took to the streets to protest against the cuts that have seen many fall into financial hardship . In a bid to offer suffering Greeks some hope, Mr Samaras will use his talks next week to raise a long-standing proposal that the measures be spread over four instead of two years, to soften their impact on a Greek economy enduring its longest and deepest recession since World War Two. No formal request will be made but the proposal will be broached as part of exploratory talks, an official said. 'The matter of extension is already being debated in Greece and abroad. Its official submission is a different matter'. Berlin insists that Athens honour its pledges but was open to discussion, Mr Seibert said. Asked about Greece seeking a two-year austerity extension, he said: 'The chancellor will of course first listen to what Mr Samaras has to say about the situation in Greece and about the implementation of its programme. 'For her, as for the rest of the German government, the agreed memorandum of understanding which sets out what the Greeks must achieve and which remains valid for us, forms the basis for working together with or helping Greece.' A two-year extension to narrow the budget deficit below 3 per cent of GDP in 2016 instead of 2014 was a key plank of Samaras's campaign for the June 17 election that brought him to power as head of a fragile three-party coalition. But Samaras and his finance minister, Yannis Stournaras, put the demand on the back burner after meeting EU/IMF inspectors in Athens last month, realising that no concessions would be considered until the lenders were convinced of their commitment to austerity - a big task given repeatedly missed targets and broken promises over the past two years. They must deliver the 11.5 billion euros before the inspectors return in early September to decide whether to release the next loan tranche and draft a key report that will determine whether the country will be supported or abandoned.","Since 2010, more than 2,500 people have taken their own lives in Greece.

"She was 33 when she gave birth to her first child, and she assumed she would go on to have more. But her successful career meant it never happened – and now actress Sherrie Hewson has admitted she is ‘haunted’ by the fact she never gave her daughter a sibling. The former Coronation Street star even urged her only child Keeley, now 30, not to make the same mistake and to focus on starting a family earlier. Mother and daughter: Sherrie Hewson, left, with her only child Keeley - who now has two children herself . Miss Hewson, now 64 and a panellist on ITV’s Loose Women, confessed she is filled with regret by her decision to become a mother so late, knowing she has deprived her daughter of brothers and sisters to turn to. She said: ‘I just think it was selfish of me not to have thought about it. I should have planned my life better. ‘I do regret not having children earlier, but my biggest regret is not giving Keeley a sibling. ‘It will always haunt me because I think it was very unfair of me to not think about doing it. Miss Hewson is a regular on the panel show Loose Women, left, and starred in Coronation Street in the 1990s as Reg Holdsworth's wife, Maureen, right. She has confessed she regrets becoming a mother so late . ‘She now doesn’t have a brother or sister. I just wish I could have given her that opportunity – to have someone she could ring – to turn to when she needed to. ‘To have that special relationship with a brother or sister – it’s a great sadness in my life.’ Born into a showbusiness family, Miss Hewson rose to fame in the 1970s, starring in Z Cars and episodes of the Carry On TV series, but it was her roles in soaps Emmerdale and Coronation Street – where she played Maureen Holdsworth – that turned her into a household name. Miss Hewson rose to fame in the 1970s starring in Z Cars before landing roles in both Coronation Street, which turned her into a household name, and Emmerdale . However, her demanding career meant the opportunity to settle down did not present itself until 1983, when she married businessman Ken Boyd. Sadly, it was a toxic relationship, which saw Boyd humiliate Miss Hewson with his womanising and squander her hard-earned fortune, leaving her bankrupt. They finally divorced in 2010, nine years after she separated from him. But her advice to her daughter stuck – with Keeley giving birth to a little boy aged just 22. Miss Hewson, who has an elder brother, said: ‘I always said to her when she was young, ‘have your babies early – very early – have a boy and a girl and then stop. ‘If you want children, have them early so that you then grow up with them.’ And the actress believes that Keeley has done herself a great favour by having her children early, adding: ‘My daughter is only just 30, and she has an eight-year-old boy [Oliver] and a three-year old-girl [Molly] – she doesn’t need any more, and now she can start her career, without having to put a brake on it to have children. ‘She can get on with it and have a whole career of her own. ‘I made the mistake of waiting until I was 33 to have Keeley – but I hadn’t met anybody before then and I had a career that I didn’t know how to stop.'","Sherrie Hewson was 33 when she gave birth to her first and only child .

"The scrap of papyrus claiming Jesus had a wife, which was dismissed by the Vatican as a modern forgery, has been authenticated as a genuine ancient document. Scientists from several prestigious U.S universities have said it was written between the fourth and eight centuries. The fragment of papyrus is written in ancient Coptic and reads: 'Jesus said to them, ""My wife""' and '…she will be able to be my disciple…' The discovery of a scrap of papyrus that claimed Jesus had a wife caused a holy row of words in the Vatican over its authenticity - but U.S scientists say it is ancient . The papyrus’ back side, or verso, is so badly damaged that only a few key words - 'my mother' and 'three'- were decipherable, but on the front side, or recto, Professor King gleaned eight fragmentary lines: . Historians and religious leaders have been clamouring to both prove and deny the artefact's credibility after it was shown to the world around 18 months ago by Harvard professor Karen King. Some experts have claimed that if the papyrus is true, it could be used to prove that Jesus was married instead of celibate, which could  undermine one of the Church's main teachings. A furious Vatican newspaper dismissed the find as a fake in an editorial by its editor, Giovanni Maria Vian who wrote a stinging piece entitled 'At any rate, a fake,' which questioned the document's authenticity. The new study, published in the Harvard Theological Review, revealed the results of the latest carbon dating tests to be carried out on the document, which was found to date to eighth century Egypt, around 400 years later than Professor King originally thought, The Boston Globe reported. Additional tests showed that the ink’s chemical composition is consistent with other inks used by the ancient Egyptians, while microscopic imaging found no suspicious ink pooling that critics of the papyrus said was evidence of the ink being applied in more recent times. Controversy: Karen King announced the finding at an international congress on Coptic studies in Rome in 2012 and the Vatican as well as others reacted furiously to some interpretations of the ancient fragment, which is written in Ancient Coptic . Critics have said that the fragment is a collage of pieces of the Gospel of Thomas by someone with a dubious grasp of ancient Coptic. One scholar even claims to have found a typo in an online edition of the gospel, which matches one in what they say is a forgery. Other experts have claimed that ink pooling suggests that the document was created in modern times. Leo Depuydt, an Egyptologist at Brown University, said that none of the new tests have convinced him that the papyrus is a fake. He wrote in the Harvard Theological Review that a forger may have ‘wanted to put his or her own spin on modern theological issues’ such as celibacy and the role of women in the Church. ‘As a forgery, it is bad to the point of being farcical or fobbish. . . . I don’t buy the argument that this is sophisticated. I think it could be done in an afternoon by an undergraduate student,’ he said. The provenance of the papyrus has also been questioned. The owner of the document has asked to remain anonymous but said that he acquired the artefact along with five other papyri in 1999 from a collector who got them in the 1960s in East Germany. At the time the papyrus was originally revealed, the Vatican was joined by a British scholar in calling the ancient papyrus a 'fake'. New Testament expert Professor Francis Watson of Durham University said that the fragment is a collage of texts from the Gospel of Thomas, copied and reassembled out of order in bad ancient Coptic. But Professor King said: ‘I’m basically hoping that we can move past the issue of forgery to questions about the significance of this fragment for the history of Christianity, for thinking about questions like, “Why does Jesus being married, or not, even matter?” Why is it that people had such an incredible reaction to this?’ The papyrus, which is roughly the size of a business card, appears to have been written much later than the gospels of the New Testament, which are considered to be the earliest and therefore the most reliable sources of information about the life of Christ. Professor King thinks that the text was copied from an earlier document, perhaps written in Greek, and thinks it is important in showing how Christianity spread through the Mediterranean. The papyrus has now been examined by electrical engineering, chemistry and biology experts from Columbia University, Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) who have declared that the parchment is indeed several hundred years old, according to The New York Times. The scientists emphasised that while they have authenticated its age, their examination of the papyrus does not prove that Jesus was married. Professor King said in 2012 that her 8cm by 4cm find 'does not provide evidence that the historical Jesus was married,’ but she did say it caused people to question Jesus' marital status. Ancient: The back side, or verso, of the papyrus is so badly damaged that only a few key words - 'my mother' and 'three' - are decipherable . Many people over the centuries have tried to work out a 'bloodline' for possible descendants of Jesus and Mary Magdalene. Many historians agree that there is no historical, biblical, archaeological or genetic evidence to support the idea. But the fragment of papyrus that is said to be a translation of a lost gospel has Jesus referring to 'my wife' A 13th century Cistercian monk and historian Peter of Vaux de Cernay claimed that Jesus had a relationship with Mary Magdalene. Early Mormon leaders stated that Jesus as polygamous based upon an obscure passage attributed to a second century Greek philosopher called Celsus. In the 19th century, a politician called Louis Martin published a 'history' book that claimed Jesus was married to Mary and that they both travelled to the South of France where they had a son. Subsequent books have claimed Jesus fathered a child with Mary - or possibly had more offspring with a Kashmiri woman. Author Andreas Faber-Kaiser interviewed one person who claimed to be a Kashmiri descendant of Jesus. Mary Magdalene has also been said to be the mother of Saint Sarah, while another author claims Jesus and Mary are the ancestors of all the European royal families. Professor King originally interpreted the document as a debate about celibacy. ‘Now when I come back and read the fragment, it seems the major issue being talked about was that Jesus was affirming that wives and mothers can be his disciples,’ she said in an interview earlier this week. One interpretation of the papyrus is that if it is talking about the wife of Jesus, the document could cast doubt on a centuries old official representation of Mary Magdalene as a repentant whore and overturns the Christian ideal of sexual abstinence. At the time the papyrus was announced, Professor King told Smithsonian Magazine that the fragment casts doubt 'on the whole Catholic claim of a celibate priesthood based on Jesus’ celibacy.' She said: 'What this shows is that there were early Christians for whom ... sexual union in marriage could be an imitation of God’s creativity and it could be spiritually proper and appropriate.' Professor King speculated that the so-called 'Gospel of Jesus’ Wife' may have been thrown out 'because the ideas it contained flowed so strongly against the ascetic currents of the tides in which Christian practices and understandings of marriage and sexual intercourse were surging.' This representation of Jesus as a man with earthly passions and needs has not survived in the doctrines of the established churches, which emphasise celibacy and asceticism as a spiritual ideal. The document was originally carbon dated by the University of Arizona Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Laboratory to between 200 and 400 years before the birth of Jesus, while a second test by Harvard produced an average date of 741AD. Experts at Columbia University tested the ‘ancient’ ink using a technique called micro-Raman spectroscopy to examine its chemical composition before comparing it to other similar documents in its collection. Christ Appearing to the Magdalen by Titian: The ancient papyrus arguably suggests the Messiah and Mary Magdalene, pictured, were man and wife but Professor King is keen to stress that this is not proven .","Experts from U.S universities used carbon dating to prove the fragment is ancient and was written between the fourth and eighth centuries .
The fragment is written in ancient Coptic and reads 'Jesus said to them, ""My wife""' which if true could shake up the Church's views on celibacy .
The Vatican dismissed the 8cm by 4cm piece of papyrus as a fake when it was unveiled in 2012 and some experts remain in agreement ."
"British people with homes in France were today warned that the property market is in 'free fall'. A combination of factors including the election of a tax-and-spend Socialist government means that prices are tumbling. It means an end to the boom years, when thousands of Britons poured money into rental or retirement investments across the Channel. Brits who bought an idyllic holiday home in France like this in Burgundy  have been warned the property market is in 'freefall' Some 200,000 of them currently own houses and flats in France, but Le Parisien newspaper today warns that 'transactions are collapsing' because owners have become too ambitious. Frederic Monssu, CEO of the Guy Hoquet agency, said: 'Convinced that their housing is the most beautiful and because a neighbour has sold theirs for a good price, the sellers will not lower theirs. The result is that the transaction does not happen.' Patrick Jolly, of Particulier a Particulier (Owner to Owner), said prices 'have reached such a level that buyers simply can’t keep up'. And Sebastien de Lafond, of MeilleursAgents (Best Agents) said tighter credit controls combined with higher taxes on capital gains had also having a devastating effect. France’s highest constitutional authority has just given the green light to a highly contentious tax hike affecting foreign owners of second homes. The Constitutional Council approved the new measure on August 9, despite claims that it was against European Union law. The election of French President Francois Hollande and his tax-and-spend government is one of the factors that have contributed to the fall in property prices . The law imposes an extra 'social charge' of 15.5 per cent on the existing capital gains tax related to the sale of second homes, meaning the original levy will rise from 19  to 34.5 per cent. The same 15.5 per cent 'social charge' will be added to the tax of rental income, raising the rate owners have to pay from 20 to 35.5 per cent. All of the property professionals predict declining prices which, says Le Parisien, will see the market 'go into free fall'. Reductions of up to seven per cent have already been reported in the southern Bouches-du-Rhone around Marseilles, with three per cent cuts around Nice. 'Leading indicators suggest there is a . fair chance that the eurozone economy might contract further in the . third quarter and hence enter a technical recession.' Analyst Martin van Vliet . Laurent Vimont, of the Century 21 agency said there was unlikely to be a complete 'collapse in prices' but decreases could be as high as 10 per cent in coming months. It comes as figures revealed today that the embattled eurozone is on the brink of a double-dip recession. A report showed that the 17-nation economy shrank by 0.2 per cent between April and June. The UK’s biggest trading partner suffered the decline in output as the debt crisis sweeping the continent escalated, with borrowing costs in struggling countries such as Spain and Italy remaining high. But the eurozone performance still puts the UK in the shade after figures last month revealed that Britain’s economy shrank by 0.7 per cent in the same period. This compares poorly with the likes of Germany and France, which saw better-than-expected gross domestic product growth of 0.3 per cent and zero respectively. ING Bank analyst Martin van Vliet said: 'Leading indicators suggest there is a fair chance that the eurozone economy might contract further in the third quarter and hence enter a technical recession.' With France's economy was stagnant in the second quarter, worries that Europe's second biggest economy is hovering on the edge of a new recession remain. The preliminary estimates released today by the state statistics agency Insee mark the third straight quarter without growth. The figures were in line with Insee's earlier forecast for no growth in domestic product for the quarter. But they were better than estimates by France's central bank, which had forecast a 0.1 per cent contraction in the second quarter and a continued drop in the third quarter. Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici expressed hope for growth in the second half of the year despite the lackluster first half. Speaking on Europe-1 radio, he acknowledged that the economy is 'too weak' but stressed that France is staying stable even as 'most of its partners' are in recession, including Spain, Italy and Britain. The number of jobs in France and consumer spending both shrank in the second quarter, Insee said. Imports grew more than exports, exacerbating concerns about France's growing trade deficit. While the lack of economic contraction is a relief for France's government, the lack of growth is a challenge for French President Francois Hollande, marking his first 100 days in office. The Socialist government is focusing on raising taxes on the rich and big business to try to cut the deficit, but some economists and business owners warn this will stifle growth when the country needs it badly.","Around 200,000 Brits own houses and flats in France .

"A Connecticut teen has died after he was fatally shot in the head and leg by an unknown assailant on Saturday night. Kristjan Ndoj, 15, died on Thursday morning at Bridgeport Hospital, after several days on life support. The shooting happened after Ndoj, a sophomore at Shelton High School in Connecticut, is alleged to have received death threats for talking to a girl. Scroll down for video . Kristjan Ndoj, 15, died on Thursday morning at Bridgeport Hospital, several days after he was shot in the head and leg . Ndoj was on his bike when the shooting happened and his body was found in the driveway at about 8:45 p.m. Saturday. Police believe the shots came from a wooded area near the home and neighbors said he had been visiting a female friend. Shortly before he was shot, Ndoj had received a text from a girl – believed to be a classmate – which said, ‘My boyfriend is going to kill you’, a relative told WTNH. Friend and fellow student Anthony Franco confirmed to WTNH that Ndoj had been warned by the unnamed girl’s boyfriend ‘that if he hangs out with her or talks to her anymore, there's going to be problems.’ Ndoj was on his bike when the shooting happened and his body was found in the driveway of a friend's house at about 8:45 p.m. on Saturday . Franco said he couldn't believe Ndoj might have been targeted. ‘This hasn't happened to Shelton in a long time,’ he said. ‘And to happen to a great kid like that, it's just shocking because no one would think he had enemies or he had anybody that wanted to hurt him.’ Investigators are aware of the threats that allegedly were made, but Lt. Robert Kozlowsky, Shelton Police Department, said he would not comment on potential suspects. The death is now being investigated as a homicide, the first in the city since 1996. ‘Obviously this is a very somber time… for the entire Shelton community,’ Shelton Public Schools Superintendent Freeman Burr said at a news conference on Thursday. Police believe the shots came from a wooded area near the home and neighbors said he had been visiting a female friend . Dr. Beth Smith, headmaster of Shelton High School, said that students and parents were informed of the death Thursday afternoon and counselors are on hand. An attorney for Ndoj's family says the teen will always be remembered as a bright boy with natural athletic ability and wisdom beyond his years. “The family wants to thank their Shelton neighbors,"" he said, ""as well as all those who offered their kind and thoughtful expressions of love and support toward Kristjan and his family."" The 15-year-old is survived by his mother, father and brother. Friends of the family started an online fundraising page and had raised more than $17,000 in just two days.

"They vowed to stay friends for the sake of their children. And it seems actress Helena Bonham Carter and director Tim Burton have stayed true to their word. Yesterday morning the couple were pictured on a stroll in London with their two children, Billy Ray, 11, and Nell, six. The Christmas Day outing comes just days after they announced they had separated after 13 years together. Actress Helena Bonham Carter and director Tim Burton were pictured on a Christmas Day stroll with their children, just days after they announced they had separated . The self-confessed 'bonkers couple' were seen on a walk in London with their children Billy Ray, 11, and Nell, six . Bonham Carter, 48, was said by friends to have been left devastated by the split and on Christmas Eve she was pictured collecting groceries, preparing for what some may have thought would be her first Christmas without Burton. But these pictures suggest they have put whatever differences they had to one side to spend the festive period together. Dressed for the cold weather in matching black coats, the self-confessed ‘bonkers couple’ appeared relaxed as they chatted while their children enjoyed ice lollies and chocolate on the walk in Primrose Hill. Bonham Carter looked typically kooky, wearing chunky ankle boots, a long skirt and a floppy bobble hat. Burton, 56, best known for writing and directing romantic fantasy film Edward Scissorhands, wore sunglasses and carried a plastic bag. Their spokesman said on Tuesday: ‘Tim Burton and Helena Bonham Carter separated amicably earlier this year and have continued to be friends and co-parent their children.’ News of their separation came a year after Burton was pictured embracing a mystery blonde, thought to be one of his assistants, near his home in Hampstead. Bonham Carter and Burton, who have been together for 13 years, vowed to stay friends for the sake of their children . Putting on a brave face: Helena Bonham Carter was pictured doing some last-minute Christmas shopping on December 24, just one day after she and Tim Burton announced their split after 13 years together . At the time, a spokesman for Bonham Carter denied Burton has been unfaithful, claiming the woman was part of a large group of family and friends who had been visiting the cinema with the director. But a month later, the actress said she may no longer work with Burton again, ‘he’s getting sick of me,’ she joked. Friends claim Bonham Carter has been in a ‘bad way’ and have accused Burton of having a ‘mid-life crisis’. ‘Helena was very upset at the Chequers party earlier this month hosted by Samantha Cameron,’ a friend has said. ‘Other guests noticed she was in a bad way. She is really upset. It’s all still very raw and they only told the children two weeks ago.’ Another friend says: ‘Tim is having a classic mid-life crisis. All Helena’s friends think he’s a terrible old cliche. Helena gave him a lot of time to sort himself out.’ Unconventional: The self-confessed 'bonkers couple' famously did not share a home, instead living next door to each other in north London with their children, Billy Ray, 10, and Nell, six. 'The houses are joined,' Bonham Carter has explained in the past . Last week she was pictured leaving PR man Matthew Freud’s Christmas Party in the early hours of Friday morning – apparently a little worse for wear – alongside Angus Deayton and his wife. However, she and Burton spent Saturday together, attending a production of Cats in the West End. The unconventional couple met on the set of 2001’s Planet of the Apes, which Burton directed and went on to collaborate on a number of films. Bonham Carter started in his Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Sweeney Todd, Alice in Wonderland and Dark Shadows. She is currently reprising her role as the Red Queen in Alice in Wonderland: Through the Looking Glass, which Burton is producing. They lived next door to each other in north London with their children . Bonham Carter told previously how they only ‘sometimes’ shared a bed because of ‘a snoring issue’. ‘I talk, he snores. The other thing is, he’s an insomniac, so he needs to watch television to get to sleep. I need silence,’ she said. The Sunday Times Rich List last year claimed the couple had a combined wealth of £80million.","Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Burton pictured on a Christmas stroll .
